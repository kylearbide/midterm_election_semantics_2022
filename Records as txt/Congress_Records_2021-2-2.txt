ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
HONORING MARIA MANZO 
(Mr. FOSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Maria Manzo for 10 
years of service to our office, to the 
communities that we represent in Illi-
nois, and to our country. 
Maria was one of the first people who 
we hired back in the spring of 2008 
when I left the crazy business of 
science to enter the sane and steady 
business of the United States Congress. 
Maria began as our ambassador to 
the Hispanic communities in Aurora, 
the second largest city of Illinois, and 
she now coordinates outreach to all 
citizens of Illinois’ 11th District. 
Maria was with me during the terror 
of the economic collapse, the historic 
victories of ObamaCare, and the polit-
ical firestorm that accompanied it. She 
was with us during the electoral de-
feats of the Tea Party wave and the 
electoral victories of our subsequent 
return to office. Maria is now a steady 
and trusted voice in our community as 
we navigate the coronavirus crisis. 
During those 10 years, I had the 
chance to watch Maria’s wonderful 
children, Elijah and Sophia, progress 
from early childhood to becoming en-
chanting adults. 
Maria Manzo, it has been a great 10 
years. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 4 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my friend, 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 85, providing 
for consideration of H.R. 447, the Na-
tional 
Apprenticeship 
Act 
of 
2021, 
under a structured rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment by Chairman SCOTT, makes in 
order 26 amendments, provides en bloc 
authority to Chairman SCOTT, and pro-
vides one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H. Con. Res. 11 under a closed 
rule. 
It 
self-executes 
a 
manager’s 
amendment by Chairman YARMUTH. It 
also provides 3 hours of debate with 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Budget 
and 1 hour equally divided and con-
trolled by Representatives BEYER
of 
Virginia and SCHWEIKERT of Arizona, or 
their respective designees.

The rule also provides that H. Res. 73 
is hereby adopted. The rule updates the 
process by which Members can appeal 
fines for refusing to wear a mask or for 
taking photographs or recording audio 
or video on the House floor to align 
with the Ethics Committee appeal pro-
cedures established in H. Res. 73. 
Finally, the rule extends standard 
district work period instructions, same 
day, and suspension authority through 
March 12, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Appren-
ticeship Act is critical workforce de-
velopment legislation that will invest 
$3.5 billion to create nearly 1 million 
new apprenticeship opportunities over 
the next 5 years. This is a history in-
vestment in workforce training, and I 
am so pleased to support this effort. 
Skilled workers are the backbone of 
our economy. And apprenticeships pro-
vide a unique opportunity to grow and 
expand access to this workforce. 
Not only do apprenticeship programs 
provide pathways to meaningful and 
sustainable careers, they are critical to 
expanding our Nation’s skilled work-
force. When I meet with local busi-
nesses in my district in Rochester, New 
York, I regularly hear that their great-
est challenge is finding skilled labor to 
fill positions and keep their businesses 
thriving. 
Apprenticeships provide an invalu-
able pathway to engage workers, estab-
lish connections with high-demand in-
dustries, and set workers on a path to 
a rewarding and sustainable career. 
I note that as the son of an indi-
vidual who dropped out of high school 
at the age of 16, my dad, after service 
in Korea in the United States Army, 
came home and got involved in an ap-
prenticeship for the Plumbers and 
Pipefitters Local 13 Union and had a 
long, long career where he retired at 
the age of 70 after having supported a 
family of seven. What was directly re-
sponsible for that was the apprentice-
ship program and his ability to build 
that sustained career. 
I am particularly proud that a bill I 
introduced with my colleague, Con-
gresswoman TRAHAN, has been included 
in the text of the National Apprentice-
ship Act. Our bill helps scale up par-
ticipation among populations not typi-
cally engaged in apprenticeships, par-
ticularly 
small- 
and 
medium-sized 
businesses, and together we can create 
new opportunities in high-demand in-
dustries. 
Now, more than ever, these programs 
are critical to grapple with the long- 
term economic impacts of COVID–19. 
This week we will also begin the next 
phase 
of 
addressing 
the 
ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic through H. Con. 
Res. 11, a budget resolution for fiscal 
year 2021. Passing this budget resolu-
tion is a necessary step to fast-track 
essential COVID relief, the American 
Rescue Plan. 
This plan will deliver the direct sup-
port the American public needs, includ-
ing a national vaccination program, di-
rect aid to individuals and families, 
housing and nutrition assistance, and 
expansion and extension of unemploy-
ment insurance, small business assist-
ance, and resources to protect first re-
sponders and frontline workers. 
Our Nation has endured an unprece-
dented health and economic crisis 
which has now claimed the lives of 
nearly half a million Americans. After 
11 months, far too many Americans are 
still barely scraping by or falling fur-
ther behind, through no fault of their 
own, as they lose jobs or see smaller 
paychecks. We need immediate, bold 
action to change the course of the 
virus and stabilize our economy. 
Beginning the budget reconciliation 
process does not preclude a strong bi-
partisan agreement on a relief package 
that can gain wide support in both the 
House and the Senate. Let me repeat 
that. It does not preclude a strong, bi-
partisan agreement on a relief package 
that can gain wide support in our 
House and across the building in the 
Senate. But it does ensure that Con-
gress will be able to move forward 
without becoming delayed by partisan 
gridlock at a time when so many lives 
and livelihoods are at stake. 
The budget resolution before us pro-
vides a framework for reconciliation 
with a target of up to $1.9 trillion, allo-
cated across 12 congressional commit-
tees. The resolution instructs these 
committees to report legislation con-
sistent with their targets to the Budg-
et Committee by February 16. The 
Budget Committee will then combine 
the 
legislation—without 
substantive 
revision—and prepare it for floor con-
sideration. 
The 2021 budget resolution is not a 
comprehensive blueprint for the next 10 
years. It is designed solely to respond 
to the ongoing crisis and to deliver 
critical relief as quickly as possible. 
Once we have finished the work of 
passing a complete COVID response 
package, I look forward to continuing 
our work on the Budget Committee to 
craft a complete forward-looking budg-
et resolution for fiscal year 2022. 
b 1715 
We have already lost so much time. 
Passing this resolution ensures that re-
lief can get to Americans in need, who 
cannot wait another minute for help. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also take a mo-
ment to recognize that, less than 1 
month ago, this Chamber was besieged 
by antidemocracy extremists who in-
tended to harm this institution and 
even kill some of our colleagues. 
The rule provides penalties for any 
Member of the House who endangers 
colleagues by violating the rules of this 
Chamber. Members are not, under any 
circumstances, permitted to bring fire-
arms on the floor of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. That has been in law 
and regulation since 1967. 
As President Ronald Reagan said: 
‘‘Trust, but verify.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, 
there should be no problem with re-
quiring Members to walk through 
metal detectors into the Chamber, en-
suring that everyone is following the 
same rules, ensuring the safety of each 
and every Member of this body, and en-
suring that many members of our staff 
who work here day in and day out are 
protected. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this rule and H. Con. 
Res. 11 and the National Apprentice-
ship Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. MORELLE for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides 
for consideration of two pieces of legis-
lation. The first, H.R. 447, is the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act. The bill 
seeks to improve and streamline access 
to apprenticeships. These goals are 
broadly supported by Members on both 
sides of the political aisle, in the House 
and in the Senate. 
We considered an almost identical 
bill in the 116th Congress, which was 
the previous Congress. At that time, 
Republicans expressed a desire to work 
together to achieve the goal of modern-
izing the National Apprenticeship Pro-
gram. Since then, the Democrats have 
pushed through their bill that did 
nothing to streamline the program, 
nothing for flexibility for employer- 
driven apprenticeships. 
The bill before us today is largely the 
same. Rather than work with Repub-
licans in a meaningful way, the major-
ity remains committed to codifying 
decades of rigid regulations and red 
tape. The Committee on Education and 
Labor did not even have a hearing or a 
markup on this bill before it came be-
fore the Committee on Rules, essen-
tially shutting out committee Repub-
licans from the negotiation process en-
tirely—many of whom were new mem-
bers on the Committee on Education 
and Labor and did not participate in 
the discussion in the last Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, between 2009 and 2019, 
America saw a 128 percent growth in 
apprenticeships. In September of 2020, 
the Department of Labor reported that 
94 percent of all apprentices who com-
pleted their apprenticeship received an 
average annual salary of $70,000. To-
day’s registered apprenticeship system 
is an important tool for job seekers and 
employers. 
It does have some flaws, however. In 
2019, 252,000 individuals began an ap-
prenticeship. Good for them, but only 
81,000 graduated. 
This bill would make the apprentice-
ship system the only registered and De-
partment of Labor-supported appren-
ticeship option, shutting the door on 
opportunities for those who participate 
in nonregistered earn-and-learn pro-
grams. While so many in the Nation 
have lost work due to the economic 
toll of the pandemic, now is not the 
time to make it harder to find ade-
quate training by reducing an individ-
ual’s apprenticeship options.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H268 
February 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, the National Appren-
ticeship Act would make this system 
even less receptive to innovation and 
create prescriptive requirements on ap-
prenticeships. It also makes it difficult 
for small and medium-sized businesses 
to participate, as they do not always 
have the resources to navigate the 
lengthy and Byzantine Department of 
Labor registration process. 
America desperately needs more lab 
technicians. We need more medical as-
sistants. We need more pharmacy tech-
nicians. In the middle of a global pub-
lic health crisis, we cannot afford to 
stymie motivated future employees. 
Republicans agree that this 80-year- 
old system can and must be improved, 
but the solutions must be targeted and 
effective. The majority claims that the 
increased funding in this legislation 
will create 1 million apprenticeships. 
While it is true that the legislation 
provides significantly more funding, 
unfortunately, 
more 
money 
alone 
doesn’t guarantee better outcomes if 
the underlying systems don’t work in 
the first place. 
Mr. Speaker, the second part of this 
rule provides for consideration of H. 
Con. Res. 11, establishing a budget for 
fiscal year 2021, and providing the 
budget reconciliation instructions for 
fiscal years 2021 through 2030. Budget 
reconciliation is a fast-track, budg-
etary tool used to implement policy 
changes into law. This procedure re-
quires only 51 votes in the Senate—not 
the normal 60 votes to break the fili-
buster, but only 51 votes in the Sen-
ate—which, unfortunately, can turn 
this into a partisan exercise, which is 
what happened here today. 
President Biden has proposed a $1.9 
trillion coronavirus relief package, but 
under the reconciliation instructions 
included in the resolution, the deficit 
would increase to between $2 trillion 
and $3 trillion. 
Look, on the west front of the Cap-
itol 2 weeks ago, the President called 
for unity—his first move. And, today, 
we see the Democrats employing a par-
tisan process to jam through their wish 
list of policy priorities. 
The Budget Committee has not yet 
even organized as a committee, but the 
Committee on Rules adopted a rule to 
consider budget reconciliation without 
any prior hearings or markups. This 
will be the first time since 1974 that 
Congress has bypassed the Budget 
Committee and gone straight to the 
floor with a budget resolution. 
In addition, the Democrats did not 
pass a budget resolution at all for fis-
cal year 2021. So the budget resolution 
before us today is exactly 290 days late. 
Barely 
1 
month 
ago, 
Congress 
passed—and President Trump signed 
into law—a $900 billion coronavirus re-
lief package. Combined with previous 
relief 
packages—and 
there 
were 
many—there remains $1 trillion in 
unspent funding. To my knowledge, 
there have been very few, if any, au-
thorizing and oversight hearings to ac-
count for what funds are needed and 
how these funds have been spent and 
ensure they are being used in a way 
that best benefits the American people. 
With all of that as background, then 
you have to ask yourself: ‘‘Why is it 
now so urgent to pass another $2 tril-
lion bill?’’ 
Well, the answer lies in the progres-
sive, partisan policy priorities that the 
majority wants to push through, in-
cluding raising taxes, increasing the 
minimum 
wage, 
implementing 
the 
Green New Deal, providing a path to 
citizenship for illegal aliens, lowering 
Medicare eligibility, providing uni-
versal basic income, and canceling stu-
dent loan debt. 
But these policies do not address the 
immediate needs of Americans who are 
trying to survive the pandemic. Now is 
not the time to push partisan prior-
ities. 
Look, Republicans do stand ready to 
work with Democrats to provide the 
needed resources for the American peo-
ple. Yesterday’s visit by 10 Republican 
senators to the Oval Office and the 
time that President Biden spent with 
them certainly should be indicative to 
people that there is a willingness to 
work together to solve the problems of 
the country, but we also are obligated 
to ensure that the proposals are thor-
oughly vetted and will be implemented 
in a way that actually helps rather 
than further harms our recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I would add that Mr. 
MORELLE referenced some of the other 
things contained in the rule. I think it 
is important that Members understand 
the threats under which we operate. As 
such, I, frankly, do not understand why 
we have not been provided a classified 
briefing by the Speaker of the House as 
to what the threats were prior to Janu-
ary 6 and what the threats are going 
forward. Suffice it to say, that the peo-
ple’s House—the House of Representa-
tives—now is completely on lockdown. 
There are no people in the people’s 
House other than the Representatives, 
and that is not the way it was in-
tended. 
I think we are owed an explanation 
for what the level of threat is so that 
we may adequately prepare ourselves 
in our personal lives, as well as our 
work in our districts. I would call upon 
the Speaker to make such a bipartisan 
Member briefing available as soon as 
possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I first 
want to say to the distinguished gen-
tleman, my friend: These are not par-
tisan priorities; these are American 
priorities. 
I doubt very much that most Ameri-
cans care about the process we use as 
they struggle to feed their families or 
as they struggle to pay their rent each 
month, when they face unemployment 
that could be extended. But here is an 
opportunity for us to work together. 
This is the beginning of the process, 
and we will continue to encourage bi-
partisan discussion on a budget resolu-
tion that provides meaningful relief for 
millions of Americans affected by this 
virus. 
As it relates to the National Appren-
ticeship Act, I would also suggest that 
this is a bipartisan bill. I can name the 
Members of my colleagues across the 
aisle: Mr. FITZPATRICK; Mr. MCKINLEY; 
Members Bacon and Bost; my friend, 
RODNEY
DAVIS, from Illinois; JOHN 
KATKO, whose district abuts mine; 
ANDY GARBARINO, my friend from New 
York; 
Representatives 
STAUBER, 
KINZINGER, STIVERS—all Republicans 
who support and sponsor the National 
Apprenticeship Act. So this is a bipar-
tisan bill, and I will continue to advo-
cate for its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the chair-
man of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. MORELLE), a distinguished mem-
ber of the Committee on Rules, for 
yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the under-
lying measures before us today, but I 
take a moment to discuss something 
else included here. 
Mr. Speaker, just outside these doors 
is something students walk through 
every day to prevent gun violence in 
their schools, something travelers pass 
through every time they board an air-
plane, and something the public goes 
through every time they enter a Fed-
eral building: 
Magnetometers. Metal detectors. 
They are a modern-day inconven-
ience that we are all used to, and, 
frankly, they are a small price to pay 
to keep Americans safe. 
Metal detectors were installed out-
side this Chamber following the recent 
deadly insurrection at the Capitol. Al-
though these machines are new, the 
policy they are enforcing is not. That 
has been on the books for more than 50 
years. 
President Lyndon Johnson signed a 
law outlawing weapons on Capitol 
grounds back in 1967. The Capitol Po-
lice Board, the entity that oversees se-
curity regulations in the complex, then 
issued regulations soon after. They 
prohibited firearms from being carried 
into the Chamber and in the connected 
rooms and galleries. 
Mr. Speaker, now some Members, 
like myself, want to see these regula-
tions 
go 
further. 
Representatives 
HUFFMAN and SPEIER have been instru-
mental on this front, and I hope that 
we act. Others want no prohibitions at 
all. 
Mr. Speaker, regardless, the rules are 
the rules. I thought that was clear, but 
apparently some of my friends on the 
other side think differently. Some are 
acting as though, by being elected to 
Congress, they have been anointed to 
some sort of special club, one that gets 
to pick and choose what rules to fol-
low. 
A Member on the other side ran an ad 
depicting her walking around our Na-
tion’s Capital with a loaded firearm,

tweeting: ‘‘Let me tell you why I will 
carry my Glock to Congress.’’ 
Another Republican recently bragged 
that he was armed during the recent 
riots, and another was stopped by Cap-
itol Police bringing a gun into this 
Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I could go on. We have 
people in this Chamber who have post-
ed disturbing and threatening rhetoric 
against Members of this body. And 
there is speculation that maybe some 
Members were complicit with those 
who attacked the Capitol on January 6. 
You know, these words and actions 
raise serious safety concerns. 
Mr. Speaker, these metal detectors 
are manned by the same police officers 
who saved our lives during the insur-
rection while risking their own, yet 
some Members on the other side have 
disrespected these Capitol Police Offi-
cers, verbally abused them, pushed 
them aside, and disregarded their or-
ders, all to avoid this basic safety 
measure. That is no way to treat our 
heroes. 
Some of these very same Members 
have been quick to send press releases 
and cut advertisements about the need 
to respect the police; but here in these 
Halls, when they think no one is 
watching, apparently their message is 
different. It is: ‘‘Do as I say, not as I 
do.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that is why we must act 
today. This isn’t a messaging bill. This 
is as serious as it gets. This elitist 
mentality must end. 
b 1730 
Apparently, it will take a rules 
change to ensure that all Members fol-
low the rules just like everyone else. 
Included in this measure is language 
to change the rules to fine Members 
who interfere with the Capitol Police’s 
ability 
to 
do 
their 
jobs 
at 
the 
magnetometers outside this Chamber: 
$5,000 for the first offense, $10,000 for 
each one thereafter. 
This is modeled after a change my 
Republican friends made in the 115th 
Congress, which fined Members for tak-
ing photos or videos on the floor. 
We are taking steps to make sure 
this process is transparent and fair. 
Violations will be posted online, and 
Members will have the chance to have 
their appeal considered by the bipar-
tisan Ethics Committee. 
And let me assure all Americans that 
these fines will be paid directly by 
Members. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not a mind 
reader, but I have been here long 
enough to know how this debate will 
go. Some on the other side will act like 
this is some grand inconvenience. Tell 
that to the millions of Americans who 
go through metal detectors every day 
in this country. 
Why are you any different? Give me a 
break. 
We need to protect not just Members 
but staff and all the people who work 
up here. We need to protect our con-
stituents and the public who visit the 
people’s House. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
support this change. The rules apply to 
us, too, and it is time all of us acted 
like it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), the ranking member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished Member from Texas, for yield-
ing. 
Today’s rule sets in motion a process 
for considering H. Con. Res. 11, a shell 
budget for fiscal year 2021. I understand 
that the majority’s stated intent in 
bringing forward this resolution is to 
pave the way for using budget rec-
onciliation to push through a partisan 
COVID–19 
relief 
package. 
Unfortu-
nately, I think the majority’s intent is 
misguided. 
I want to remind us all that the only 
reason we are here today is that the 
majority failed to pass a budget last 
year. As of today, we are nearly 91⁄2 
months overdue for the passage of the 
budget for fiscal year 2021, and fiscal 
year 2021 is already a third of the way 
over. Hardly an auspicious start for an 
item as serious as the annual budget 
for the United States Government. 
But the lack of expeditiousness that 
characterized the budget in the 116th 
Congress has been replaced by hasti-
ness. The majority is now, in the 117th 
Congress, rushing forward with a new 
budget despite never bothering to con-
vene the Budget Committee. Indeed, 
the Budget Committee has yet to meet 
in this Congress, much less conduct 
normal hearings that pave the way for 
the markup of the annual budget. 
Rather than undertake the normal 
process 
through 
the 
Budget 
Com-
mittee, the majority is instead air- 
dropping a budget straight from leader-
ship offices directly onto the floor. 
This is hardly the kind of process con-
sidered to be regular order, and it fails 
to give Members a chance to have their 
ideas considered in committee or to 
offer amendments on the floor. 
Indeed, as a longtime member of the 
Budget Committee myself, I looked 
forward to our hearings on the budget 
and the markup. Through this process, 
Members had the opportunity to con-
sider the budget, consider expert testi-
mony, offer ideas, and propose amend-
ments to be considered by the whole 
committee. That the majority is fail-
ing to do so makes a mockery out of 
the entire budgeting process. 
Over the past year, Congress has 
shown it can work together to produce 
bipartisan legislation. In the last Con-
gress, we actually passed five COVID–19 
relief bills that appropriated nearly $4 
trillion in relief funds. Not all of these 
funds have yet been spent. Not even 
close, Mr. Speaker. And the $4 trillion 
number is right around the annual 
budgetary outlays of the Federal Gov-
ernment in a normal year, covering 
both 
mandatory 
and 
discretionary 
spending. 
Yet, the majority is moving forward 
with yet another bill and seems deter-
mined to ensure that this bill enshrines 
as many partisan policy priorities as 
possible. 
To make matters worse, from look-
ing at the actual budget before us, we 
do not know what these partisan prior-
ities are. We know the budget includes 
instructions to committees to increase 
spending by certain amounts, but it 
does not offer any guidance on how 
they should do so. 
Will it encompass only COVID relief 
matters, or will they enact progressive 
policy goals like Medicare for All or 
the Green New Deal? We have no way 
of knowing. 
We do know that Senator BERNIE 
SANDERS, the socialist leader of the 
Senate Budget Committee, wants to 
use reconciliation to ram through a $15 
minimum wage, a measure that would 
be a disaster for workers and busi-
nesses alike in my home State of Okla-
homa. But what else may be included 
in the bill is a mystery. 
Mr. Speaker, this process hardly be-
fits the bipartisanship that we were 
promised by President Biden. It has 
been less than 2 weeks since the new 
President was inaugurated, and already 
we are seeing the majority abandoning 
any pretense at bipartisanship. 
The House majority has failed to 
even propose a bipartisan COVID relief 
bill or to engage Republicans in serious 
negotiations. Instead, they have simply 
predetermined the outcome and are 
moving forward with their own par-
tisan bill without even pretending to 
try to work with those of us on my side 
of the aisle. 
This is hardly what we were prom-
ised, Mr. Speaker. It is hardly what the 
institution was promised. And on a 
matter as important as the annual 
budget of the United States, and during 
a pandemic as deadly and serious as 
the 
one 
we 
are 
currently 
living 
through, I know the institution can do 
better. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this course and work together 
and pass real bipartisan legislation 
that will benefit all Americans. 
Today’s rule also adds a change in 
the House rules, imposing serious fines 
on Members who fail to go through the 
new magnetometers around the Cham-
ber. Mr. Speaker, as I told my col-
leagues on the Rules Committee a 
short time ago, I don’t disagree with 
the additional security measures to 
keep Members and staff safe. However, 
I do have concerns over how the new 
measures are being implemented. 
Earlier this afternoon, I offered an 
amendment to this rule which would 
have instructed the House Committee 
on Administration to review the mat-
ter and make appropriate recommenda-
tions. I have no issue whatsoever with 
Members being subjected to the same 
requirements as staff and our constitu-
ents when they enter the Capitol, but I 
have serious concerns that the major-
ity’s proposed solution is untenable. 
Requiring Members to pass through a 
magnetometer each time they enter

February 2, 2021 
the House Chamber, even if they 
haven’t left the area, is a sure recipe 
for chaos. It is impossible for Members 
to socially distance when they are 
stacked up in a line to await their turn 
at passing through the metal detectors. 
When Members need to leave the 
Chamber to make a phone call right 
outside the doorway, they have to re-
enter and pass through security again. 
And there are hardworking staff mem-
bers who work just a few feet away 
from the House Chamber but must pass 
through these same magnetometers 
every time they need to run to their of-
fices and then back to the floor. This is 
a clear recipe for disorganization and 
gridlock. 
But this need not be the only option, 
Mr. Speaker. There are already exist-
ing metal detectors and X-ray ma-
chines at entrances to the building. 
Why can’t Members be screened at 
those entrances instead? Why must it 
be right on the way to the very cusp of 
the Chamber in a location guaranteed 
to stack up Members outside the door 
waiting to get in? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, we have bet-
ter alternatives, and I urge that we em-
power the Committee on House Admin-
istration to look at that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the rejection of 
the rule. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will admit that there 
are few people I respect more than my 
distinguished colleague and friend from 
the Rules Committee, the ranking 
member, Mr. COLE. 
But I think as it relates to the budg-
et, as I understand it, the Budget Com-
mittee chair, Mr. YARMUTH, has contin-
ued to extend an invitation to our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
work together. 
And we do want to work together. We 
want to forge a bipartisan agreement. 
This today begins a process, however, 
that can move us toward reconciliation 
because we understand that the Amer-
ican people are in crisis. America is in 
crisis. 
So while we need to move ahead, and 
we would like to move ahead with a bi-
partisan agreement, we cannot sit idly 
by in the instance that progress is not 
made. 
I think it was President Kennedy in 
his inauguration, nearly 60 years ago, 
who said, ‘‘Sincerity is always subject 
to proof.’’ So prove to us your sin-
cerity. Let’s work together. And in the 
interim, we are going to move ahead 
with this resolution with the support of 
the Members, and I certainly hope that 
they will do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), my new favorite 
ranking member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Texas for yielding, and we are thrilled 
that he is on the Budget Committee. 
The rule puts in motion a process to 
spend trillions of dollars on a progres-
sive wish list, all under the appearance 
of pandemic relief. And for what? 
We know all five of the last COVID- 
related pieces of legislation were done 
on a bipartisan basis. In the last few 
days, we have seen a framework from 
10 Republican Senators laid out to get 
to a solution. 
The fact that we are moving forward 
with this process just goes to show that 
yesterday’s White House meeting was 
just a photo-op for the President. 
Sadly, the Democrat majority seems 
to want to go a partisan route in both 
the House and Senate because they 
know there is not a bipartisan con-
sensus in this country for the socialist 
policies they want to include, give-
aways to their base, the far left and the 
coastal elite. 
Just look at what is being discussed 
by Democrats on how they plan to use 
the budgeting process known as rec-
onciliation, a mechanism traditionally 
used to control spending and address 
the debt. They now talk openly about 
granting mass amnesty; growing the 
control government has over your 
healthcare; adding new burdens, rules, 
and costs on the very small businesses 
that they have shut down; and bailing 
out their political allies whose policies 
destroyed local economies. 
All of this they want to somehow 
hide from the American people with 
the label of essential items for pan-
demic relief. 
And the rule we are debating right 
now rewards this process. It is the first 
step in allowing Washington Demo-
crats 
to 
jam 
this 
radical 
agenda 
through Congress at lightning speed. 
I ask the Chair, where was the rush 
to help American families when the 
Speaker was holding up support for di-
rect aid to working-class families all 
spring, all summer, and all fall, eventu-
ally dropping her price tag and objec-
tions only after the first Tuesday in 
November? The first Tuesday in No-
vember happens to be election day. 
I have always kept one motto in my 
heart as I approach this job: Put people 
before politics. Unfortunately, what we 
are seeing from the Democrats is the 
exact opposite; it is all politics. 
In more than 30 years, a budget has 
not originated in the House that has 
not first gone through the committee 
process. This is truly a first. The Budg-
et Committee has yet to even meet, to 
organize, to set our rules, and to ratify 
an agenda of oversight of the new ad-
ministration. 
So why are we standing here right 
now? Why are we moving ahead like 
this when the President, in his inau-
gural address, called for unity and 
spoke about the power of our example? 
The answer is simple: So that Demo-
crat leaders can spend more on a bunch 
of programs, ideas, and systems, which 
they have dreamed about throwing tax-
payer money at since they took control 
of this Chamber 2 years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I will close with this. 
The Democrats talk about unification, 
the need to unify as a Congress and 
work together, the need to unify as a 
country and learn to respect one an-
other again for the good of America. 
But when their actions don’t match 
their words, the value of every word 
they say from that point forward be-
comes meaningless. 
The actions of the Democrat major-
ity, to start a process which will only 
end in more divisive partisanship, is 
the exact opposite of what our country 
is asking for right now. 
b 1745 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman’s 
point, I appreciate the passion with 
which the distinguished ranking mem-
ber of the Budget Committee makes his 
argument, but why are we moving 
ahead, he asked. 
Why we are moving ahead today? 
The President ran on this very relief 
agenda and won the popular vote in the 
United States by more than 8 million 
votes. We are moving ahead because 
elections do matter, and the argument 
that President Biden made is that this 
country needed swift, significant, and 
robust relief. That is why we are mov-
ing ahead. 
Now, I will continue to say—and I am 
sure my colleagues will continue to 
say—that the Democrat majority in-
vites 
bipartisan 
conversation. 
We 
would invite all the Members on the 
other side to come together in a mean-
ingful way to talk about unemploy-
ment insurance for the millions of 
Americans 
who 
are 
out 
of 
work, 
through no fault of their own—mil-
lions. 
Hundreds of thousands are filing 
every week for the first time. Millions 
of Americans don’t have enough food 
on the table. One out of every eight 
Americans are saying they don’t have 
enough money for food to put on the 
table. 
This is for the millions of Americans 
who don’t have enough money to pay 
their rent or pay their mortgage, and 
for the millions of small businesses—or 
the tens of thousands of small busi-
nesses struggling every single week, 
again, through no fault of their own. 
Why are we moving ahead today? 
Because there is no more time left on 
the clock. We need to move ahead in 
order to provide the substantial relief. 
I would also suggest that those who 
will say that this is too expensive, you 
only look to find economists all over 
this country beginning with the head 
of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, 
who was appointed by the President to 
his position, who has consistently said 
that the worst thing we can do is make 
too small of an investment. We must

make a robust investment. It is what 
President Bident talked about repeat-
edly through this campaign. 
There is no hidden agenda here. This 
is, in fact, the agenda that was talked 
about repeatedly throughout the cam-
paign. The American public resound-
ingly responded to the package that 
the President has now put forward, the 
package which we would like to take 
up. We would certainly like to do it 
with our brothers and sisters on the 
other side of the aisle, but we are pre-
pared, if not, to respond to the needs of 
millions of Americans who are in cri-
sis. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. FEENSTRA), who is a new, fresh-
man member of the Republican Con-
ference, to give what I believe is his 
first speech on the House floor. 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this proposed rule, 
which begins laying the framework for 
one of the largest spending bills in the 
history of this institution. It is nearly 
$2 trillion being dishonestly sold to the 
people as COVID relief. 
With a price tag this big, Mr. Speak-
er, you would think that the House 
Democrats would want this bill to go 
through the committee process where 
Congress and the public can digest this 
information. But no. They are attempt-
ing to fast-track this bill to make deci-
sions with no committee, no biparti-
sanship, no oversight, and no discus-
sion. 
Mr. Speaker, this is American tax-
payers’ money, not government’s, and 
it is being spent with no accountability 
and no transparency. 
The bottom line is that the hard-
working, taxpaying Americans deserve 
to have a voice in this process, and I 
will fight against attempts to fast- 
track this bloated bill every step of the 
way. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, 
to encourage local educational agen-
cies to resume in-person instruction in 
elementary and secondary schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include in the RECORD the text 
of my amendment, along with any ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. HINSON), who is here to explain 
the amendment. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose the previous question, 
and I do so in support of our students. 
Our amendment would ensure that 
students get back in schools safely and 
soon. Students have been out of the 
classroom for far too long, and the 
costs of at-home learning are far great-
er than we could have ever imagined, 
especially when it comes to mental 
health for our kids. 
My bill, the Reopen Schools Act, 
would prioritize State COVID relief 
grants for education for schools that 
are reopening. It would require schools 
to offer at least partial in-person learn-
ing in order to receive these Federal 
pandemic relief funds. These funds 
were intended to help students get 
back into the classroom safely, taking 
important precautions. 
Congress sent States this money so 
we could reopen schools safely, yet this 
hasn’t happened in so many commu-
nities across our country. 
I am so proud of our home State of 
Iowa for already taking a stand for stu-
dents and requiring schools to offer an 
in-person learning option. But The 
Washington Post found that roughly 
one-third of all K–12 school districts in 
the United States right now are only 
offering virtual learning. So this means 
one-third of our classrooms are closed 
and one-third of our school play-
grounds are still roped off. 
The cost of this goes well beyond aca-
demics. Child depression, anxiety, and 
other mental health challenges are 
surging. The science shows kids need to 
be back in school. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Iowa. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, even the 
CDC has confirmed that young kids 
have an extremely low infection rate 
right now, a low transmission rate, and 
a low rate of serious illness from 
COVID–19. Yet they are forced to stay 
home and learn from behind a com-
puter screen, that is if these kids have 
access to computers and broadband 
internet. 
For many students, especially those 
in rural Iowa, virtual learning is not 
easy. It is not just going downstairs 
and logging onto the family computer. 
It is sitting in the parking lot of the 
Cedar Rapids Public Library, logging 
onto the WiFi to finish homework or 
take a test. 
So it is no surprise that our most 
vulnerable students are the ones who 
will suffer the most and are suffering 
the most. Isolation, lack of social sup-
port, added stress, and environmental 
strain of this lockdown have gone on 
far too long. Kids and families are suf-
fering. 
As a mom of two school-age kids, 
this issue is personal to me. This issue 
is personal to all parents, and it is per-
sonal to all families who care about 
their kids’ well-being. Kids need to be 
in school. We can get them back behind 
a desk instead of in front of a screen, 
and we can do so safely. That is exactly 
why we allocated funds for this pur-
pose. 
It is past time for States and local 
school districts to stop hoarding these 
resources and use them for their in-
tended purpose: To pay for science- 
based safety measures that get stu-
dents and teachers back in the class-
room with less risk. 
That is why my bill would condition 
a portion of the $54 billion Congress 
sent to States for K–12 schools in De-
cember on reopening their doors. One- 
third of the education funds provided 
would be immediately available right 
now with the remaining two-thirds 
available 
to 
schools 
in 
increasing 
amounts as they move to reopen. 
Schools with at least 50 percent of stu-
dents attending in person at least 50 
percent of the time would receive the 
full amount of funding. Parents and 
students want to return to the class-
room. My bill will help make that hap-
pen. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle will join me in 
supporting our students by defeating 
the previous question, and I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans agree that 
apprenticeships are vital to American 
livelihoods and our national interests. 
We agree that reforms to these pro-
grams are necessary and prudent. It is 
time to update the apprenticeship pro-
gram to better reflect the needs of em-
ployers and the needs of our Nation. 
Republicans stand ready to negotiate. 
Now is the time to give Americans op-
portunities to succeed, and I sincerely 
hope that we will do just that. 
To recover from this pandemic, we 
must also not push through policies 
that do not address the immediate 
needs of the American people. The 
budget reconciliation resolution pro-
vided for in this rule will drastically 
increase the deficit and seek to imple-
ment nonessential partisan policy pri-
orities without first conducting the 
necessary authorization hearings and 
conducting the necessary oversight to 
ensure that current funding is spent ef-
fectively and efficiently. 
After the multiple calls for unity, it 
is disappointing that the first move 
that we are seeing from the majority in 
this Congress is to employ this par-
tisan procedural process. I do hope 
they reconsider and come back to the 
negotiating 
table 
through 
regular 
order. 
Let me just also ask again that the 
Speaker allow Members to be briefed 
by the appropriate law enforcement 
agencies as to exactly what the threats 
are here in the Nation’s Capital. I 
think we would all benefit from that 
not just in our work here in Wash-
ington, D.C., but also when we work 
with constituents and staff back in our 
districts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question, a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the rule, and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the under-
lying measures.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H272 
February 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Once again, I just say that those 
Americans who are watching what we 
do here today and over the next several 
days, they are going to be asking the 
question: What are you doing in Wash-
ington that will help the average man 
or woman and child who suffers the 
ravages of this disease and the eco-
nomic fallout? 
When I talk to people in Rochester, 
New York—and I am sure when each of 
us goes back to our home districts— 
people aren’t asking about the nuance 
of legislative procedures. They are ask-
ing about what the government is 
going to do for them as we face the 
greatest pandemic in a century and the 
greatest economic challenge in nearly 
a century both at the same time. We 
have so many other challenges as well, 
but the House of Representatives is 
going to move forward. This resolution 
does that. It says that we will cer-
tainly 
encourage 
bipartisan 
agree-
ments, bipartisan conversations, and 
bipartisan action. 
The President’s conversations with 
members of the Senate yesterday indi-
cate his willingness to do that. But we 
cannot wait. We have waited far too 
long. Too many Americans have died 
and too many families have faced the 
crisis of their lifetimes because of the 
inaction here in Washington. So we 
must move ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their support of the rule before us 
today. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule 
and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as the Member of Congress for a con-
gressional district that has experienced the 
worst of COVID–19 as a public health emer-
gency and economic catastrophe, I rise in 
strong support of the rule governing debate on 
H.R. 447, the National Appenticeship Act of 
2121, and H. Con. Res. 11, 447, as well as 
the underlying legislation. 
The National Apprenticeship Act has the po-
tential to yield $10.6 billion in net benefits to 
U.S. taxpayers in the form of increased work-
ers productivity and decreased spending on 
public-assistance programs and unemploy-
ment insurance and which bring America’s in-
vestments in apprenticeship more in line with 
countries around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation could not be 
more timely because during a time of record 
unemployment, the National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2021 creates an additional 1 million 
new apprenticeship opportunities and invests 
more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in expand-
ing opportunities and access to Registered 
Apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and 
pre-apprenticeships. 
I also strongly support H. Con. Res. 11 be-
cause it reorders budgetary priorities to pro-
vide $1.9 trillion to allow Congress to take im-
mediate and decisive action to crush the virus 
and vaccinate our people, build the economy 
back better, reopen schools, and provide 
needed support and assistance to state and 
local governments that have been asked to do 
too much with too little for far too long. 
Let me make clear at the outset Mr. Speak-
er, that nothing in this resolution precludes the 
reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral agree-
ment to pass and fund the President’s Amer-
ica Rescue Plan, which in nearly all material 
respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the 
House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, 
nearly nine months ago, only to languish on 
the Republican Senate Majority Leader’s desk 
while hundreds of thousands of our fellow 
Americans succumbed to the virus and mil-
lions of others lost their livelihoods and busi-
nesses, and everyone faced an uncertain fu-
ture. 
So if our Republican colleagues are ame-
nable to reaching an agreement on a legisla-
tive response that is commensurate to the 
challenge facing Americans, nothing in the 
legislation before will preclude that from hap-
pening. 
But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part 
of the solution, the unified and bicameral 
Democratic congressional majority, in coordi-
nation with the new Democratic Administra-
tion, will take the lead and act boldly to ad-
dress and overcome the present crisis. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor of 
West Virginia who said colorfully just a few 
days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in this nation, 
we need to go big. We need to quit counting 
the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count 
the cows and just move. And move forward 
and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire in March. 
That why this resolution, which creates a 
failsafe alternative to debating, voting, and 
passing the American Rescue Act, is abso-
lutely crucial and the right thing to do, right 
now. 
The American Rescue Plan proposed by 
President Biden takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
To beat the virus and safely reopen schools, 
the plan will mount a national vaccination pro-
gram that includes setting up community vac-
cination sites nationwide and makes the in-
vestments necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan delivers imme-
diate relief to working families bearing the 
brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Finally, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
The 2021 budget resolution is not a com-
prehensive fiscal blueprint for the next 10 
years; it is designed solely to provide the op-
tion of using reconciliation to deliver critical re-
lief and achieve the goals of the American 
Rescue Plan. 
As such, the total spending and revenue 
levels in the resolution simply reflect current- 
law projections adjusted for the estimated 
costs of the American Rescue Plan. 
Once the American Rescue Plan becomes 
law, Congress will begin its work on a forward- 
looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 
2022 that will provide urgently needed eco-
nomic support and address longstanding defi-
cits in our communities and underlying inequi-
ties in our society, which have been so starkly 
revealed and exacerbated by COVID–19. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 85 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 682) to encourage local educational 
agencies to resume in-person instruction at 
elementary and secondary schools, and for 
other purposes. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. After general debate 
the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. When the committee rises and re-
ports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except 
one motion to recommit. If the Committee 
of the Whole rises and reports that it has 
come to no resolution on the bill, then on 
the next legislative day the House shall, im-
mediately after the third daily order of busi-
ness under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole for further con-
sideration of the bill.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I apologize 
for missing the votes on February 2, 2021, re-
garding the passage of the previous question 
and rule providing for consideration of H. Con. 
Res. 11 and H.R. 447. I missed these votes 
because I was with my son as he signed his 
offer to play collegiate football. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall 
No. 19, and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 20.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2021 
No. 19 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
All-powerful God, who lives above the 
highest Stars, we borrow our heart-
beats from You. Each day Your power 
enables us to live and breathe and have 
our being. When our hopes are up-
rooted, You comfort us with Your pres-
ence. 
Lord, guide our lawmakers on a road 
that leads to a clear conscience. Inspire 
them to refuse to think, say, or do any-
thing that would disappoint You. Help 
them to hear, even in the beauty of 
falling snow, whispers of Your power. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
HONORING OFFICER BRIAN D. 
SICKNICK 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Capitol attack on January 6 unleashed 
many, many horrors, but it also re-
vealed many heroes. One such hero was 
Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, 
a New Jersey native, an Air Force Na-
tional Guard veteran, and a 12-year 
member of the Capitol Police Force 
who tragically lost his life during the 
attack. 
This evening, the body of Officer 
Sicknick will arrive at the Capitol, and 
he will lie in honor beneath the Capitol 
Rotunda. We will formally pay our re-
spects to Officer Sicknick with a serv-
ice on Wednesday. 
I join with my colleagues and mem-
bers of the Capitol Police Force in 
grieving the loss of one of their fellow 
officers. May his memory live forever 
as a model of service to our Nation, 
selflessness in the line of duty, and 
courage in the face of danger. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter entirely, the Senate, this 
week, will continue confirming Presi-
dent Biden’s Cabinet nominees, closing 
the book today on the nomination of 
Alexander Mayorkas to be the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security. 
Mr. Mayorkas’s qualifications are un-
assailable. He is a 7-year veteran of the 
DHS and has already been confirmed 
by this Chamber three—three—times. 
Like most of President Biden’s Cabinet 
nominees, his nomination is also his-
tory-making: He will be the first 
Latino and first immigrant to hold the 
top job at DHS. I look forward to con-
firming Mr. Mayorkas today. 
We have a second outstanding nomi-
nee to confirm today as well—Pete 
Buttigieg for Secretary of Transpor-
tation. Mr. Buttigieg—known to many 
simply 
as 
Mayor 
Pete—has 
dem-
onstrated an impressive familiarity 
with the entire Nation’s transportation 
challenges—challenges that are pro-
nounced in States like my own, where 
projects like the Gateway Tunnel are a 
top national priority. 
I know that Mr. Buttigieg is com-
mitted to working with Members from 
both sides to improve rail and transit, 
highways, and more in rural commu-
nities, urban centers, and everywhere 
in between. I am excited to call him 
Secretary Pete by the end of the day 
and get to work with him immediately 
on helping the MTA—the Nation’s larg-
est transit network in the country— 
and moving Gateway forward after 
years of cynical obstruction by the 
Trump administration. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
COVID–19, even as we continue to con-
firm President Biden’s nominees, the 
Senate will turn this week to the his-
toric task of preparing a rescue pack-
age to lift our country out of the 
depths of the awful COVID–19 pandemic 
and set our country back on the path 
to normalcy. Despite the best efforts of 
Congress over the past year, the needs 
in our country are still great and still 
urgent. 
The disease has been with us for 
nearly a year, and yet this January 
was officially the worst month to date. 
Nearly 100,000 Americans died just in 
the last month. Unemployment insur-
ance claims remain at nearly 1 million 
a week. Schools remain closed, busi-
nesses unvisited, and all the familiar 
fixtures of daily life still remain on 
hold. 
All of us in this Chamber are tired of 
seeing our constituents, our friends, 
our family, our country suffer. It is 
time to meet the challenges of the mo-
ment with boldness, with courage, and 
with urgency. 
When Congress came together to pass 
an interim emergency relief bill in De-
cember, we all knew the job was not 
complete. Economic experts and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S216 
February 2, 2021 
President-elect at the time called it an 
important downpayment because that 
is what it was—a downpayment, not 
the final act. No one should be sur-
prised that the first legislative act of 
the new Democratic majority is to 
build on that foundation and help the 
country defeat COVID–19 once and for 
all. So the Senate is going to move for-
ward this week with the process for 
producing the next bold rescue pack-
age. 
Yesterday, Speaker PELOSI and I filed 
a joint budget resolution for the 2021 
fiscal year, totaling $1.9 trillion, which 
will give us another legislative tool to 
pass a COVID relief bill quickly and de-
cisively. The Senate will vote to pro-
ceed on the budget resolution this 
afternoon. Time is a luxury our coun-
try does not have. 
Let me be very clear. We are not 
going to dilute, to dither, to delay. We 
are not going to dilute, dither, or 
delay. The needs of the American peo-
ple are so demanding, we need to think 
big, and we need to act quickly. The 
Senate must move forward today with 
the vote to begin debate on the budget 
resolution, and I am optimistic that 
the motion to proceed will pass. 
I would say to my Republican col-
leagues that we want this important 
work to be bipartisan. We welcome 
your ideas, your input, and your revi-
sions. We welcome cooperation. There 
is nothing about the process—or a 
budget resolution or reconciliation, for 
that matter—that forecloses the possi-
bility of bipartisanship. 
I would remind this Chamber that 
since 1980, the budget process has been 
used 17 times—17 times—to pass seri-
ous bipartisan legislation. This process 
is open to bipartisanship. 
So let me be clear to my colleagues 
this morning. There will be a bipar-
tisan, open amendment process on the 
budget resolution this week. Demo-
crats eagerly encourage participation 
from both sides of the aisle on this pro-
posal. Again, there is nothing about 
the process itself that prevents biparti-
sanship. What has made recent rec-
onciliation efforts by Senate Repub-
licans so partisan was not the process 
but the legislation they sought to pass. 
The former Senate majority—I heard 
the Senator from Texas crying croco-
dile tears about using reconciliation, 
but just a few years ago, he was an ac-
tive participant in using it twice to 
pursue expressly partisan and deeply 
unpopular legislation—first, to repeal 
our Nation’s healthcare law and kick 
millions of Americans off of their 
healthcare coverage, and second, to 
slash taxes for big corporations and the 
wealthy to the tune of a $1.7 trillion 
bill and hole in our deficit. Of course, 
Democrats opposed those efforts on the 
merits. 
At the moment, however, we are 
talking about using the budget process 
to help small business—something we 
all support. We are talking about using 
the budget process to speed the produc-
tion and distribution of a vaccine that 
everyone 
champions 
and 
everyone 
knows is the key to ending the crisis. 
We are talking about getting our coun-
try back on its feet and our economy 
back on track. 
We want this entire effort to be bi-
partisan. We do. But helping the Amer-
ican people with the big, bold relief 
they need—that is job No. 1. That is job 
No. 1, which is so, so important. So, 
again, we are not going to dilute, dith-
er, or delay because the demands of the 
American people are so real and so 
large. We need to think big and think 
quickly. 
Helping millions of Americans who 
are still without work by extending the 
enhanced unemployment benefits that 
are now slated to expire in March. 
Helping parents waiting for the day 
their kids can finally go back to school 
safely. Helping teachers, firefighters, 
busdrivers, and other essential public 
employees at the State and local lev-
els, preventing them from the risk of 
layoffs. Helping restaurants and bars 
and theaters, which were the first to 
close and may be the last to open. 
Helping every American struggling to 
make ends meet, to pay the rent, pay 
the mortgage, pay for groceries, keep 
up with that utility bill, by sending 
them direct assistance in the form of a 
check. That is job No. 1—helping the 
American people survive the toughest 
months of this crisis while hastening 
the end of the crisis itself. 
In the months to come, millions of 
Americans will be vaccinated, and 
slowly but surely, life will return to 
normal once again. The rescue plan 
proposed by President Biden—the res-
cue plan that we begin to work on this 
week—will lay the foundation for our 
country’s 
long-awaited 
comeback, 
while giving Americans a helping hand 
to stay safe and stay financially secure 
in the meantime. 
I look forward to proceeding with 
this budget resolution and on the work 
of making this historic and vital rescue 
package a reality so it works for the 
American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

NOMINATIONS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today 
the 
Senate 
will 
vote 
on 
Alejandro Mayorkas, President Biden’s 
nominee to be Secretary of Homeland 
Security. 
Up to this point, I have voted in 
favor of the President’s mainstream 
nominees to key posts. I will have my 
differences with Secretaries Austin, 
Yellen, and Blinken on policy, but they 
were mainstream choices from the 
President. 
Mr. Mayorkas is something else. He 
does not deserve Senate confirmation 
to lead Homeland Security. Frankly, 
his record should foreclose confirma-
tion even to a lower post. The problem 
isn’t 
experience—not 
exactly. 
Mr. 
Mayorkas is all too familiar with the 
levers of power that control U.S. immi-
gration law. The problem is when he is 
chosen to pull those levers—and for 
whose benefit. 
As a high-ranking official in the 
Obama administration, Mr. Mayorkas 
did his best to turn U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services into an un-
ethical favor factory for Democratic 
Party royalty. Governors, a DNC chair, 
Hollywood executives, a Senate major-
ity leader from Nevada—they all re-
ceived special treatment to a degree 
that stunned and disturbed the Obama 
administration’s own inspector general 
over at that Department. His inde-
pendent report blasted the ‘‘appearance 
of favoritism and special access.’’ We 
are talking about shoving through 
green cards as political favors and in-
tervening to overturn denials. The IG 
confirmed this wasn’t just about speed; 
Mr. Mayorkas’s improper influence ac-
tually changed outcomes. 
This wasn’t the first time this nomi-
nee abused an office for political pur-
poses. Before his tenure at DHS, while 
U.S. attorney, the nominee had helped 
his fellow California Democrats get a 
well-connected L.A. drug kingpin onto 
President Clinton’s infamous eleventh- 
hour pardons list. The drug dealer’s fa-
ther was a Democratic Party donor. 
Mysteriously, 
several 
notable 
Cali-
fornia Democrats took an extremely 
keen interest in the case. Both Mr. 
Mayorkas and yet another one of Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees, Mr. Becerra, 
came under scrutiny for their personal 
roles in the special treatment that was 
dished out to this donor’s son. 
When questioned about these actions, 
Mr. Mayorkas responded with false and 
conflicting statements, including while 
under oath. Reviews of USCIS under 
Mr. Mayorkas found intimidation and 
retaliation against employees when 
they were too focused on rooting out 
fraud 
instead 
of 
merely 
rubberstamping applications. Accord-
ing to some of his own employees, his 
leadership led to ‘‘a culture of fear and 
disrespect.’’ 
Does this sound like somebody who 
deserves a promotion? 
Employees reported Mr. Mayorkas 
viewed the people applying to live here 
as the Agency’s ‘‘customers,’’ whom it 
was their job to please and satisfy. 
They said the crucial goal that defined 
his approach was not enforcing Amer-
ican laws, protecting American jobs, or 
defending the American homeland, but 
rather ensuring there were ‘‘zero com-
plaints’’ from the customers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S217 
February 2, 2021 
I will close with one observation. 
Last week, I heard the Democratic 
leader 
compare 
the 
confirmation 
timelines for Mr. Mayorkas versus Gen. 
John Kelly—an ethically compromised 
partisan lawyer versus a retired four- 
star general whom the Senate con-
firmed 88 to 11. The contrast could not 
be sharper. For one thing, I would say 
Secretary Kelly understood that our 
customers, first and foremost, are al-
ways the American people. It is, frank-
ly, remarkable that someone with his 
record is even up for a Cabinet appoint-
ment. 
I will be voting against this con-
firmation and urge our colleagues to do 
the same. 
f 
BURMA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, on another 
matter, the United States and demo-
cratic countries around the world are 
anxiously watching events in Burma. I 
have had an interest in Burma for 
many years, since I chaired the Appro-
priations Subcommittee for State and 
Foreign Operations. 
Just last November, here on the 
floor, I cautiously celebrated Burma’s 
recent elections. I warned that its mili-
tary remained a toxic influence and an 
obstacle to democratic progress. 
Sure enough, the world was horrified 
over the weekend when Burma’s mili-
tary rounded up the country’s civilian 
political leadership, including Aung 
San Suu Kyi and civil society leaders. 
The military was afraid the popular 
support of the new government would 
yield the constitutional economic re-
forms they long opposed. So they tried 
to simply claim control for themselves. 
I spoke with President Biden and 
Secretary Blinken yesterday about the 
situation in Burma. The new adminis-
tration deserves credit for approaching 
the situation in a way that is bipar-
tisan and coordinated with Congress. 
The world is watching. I hope and ex-
pect the United States will quickly 
make the obvious legal determination 
that this is a military coup and impose 
significant costs on the military for its 
attack on democracy. We already have 
sanctions in place against key military 
officials in that country, and Congress 
has already given the executive branch 
the authorities it actually needs to 
swiftly apply even more sanctions to 
the military and its infiltration into 
Burma’s economy. 
But we will also need the help of our 
friends and allies to effectively pres-
sure the junta. It is time for freedom- 
loving nations to stand up for democ-
racy and impose their own meaningful 
costs on the military junta. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party’s 
state news organ dismissively called 
the events in Burma a ‘‘major cabinet 
reshuffle.’’ A ‘‘cabinet reshuffle’’? That 
is a joke and the free world knows it. 
This is a military coup and an attack 
on democracy—plain and simple. 
There are two paths before Burma. It 
can continue to grow into a modern, 
democratic country connected to the 
global economy or remain a corrupt, 
impoverished authoritarian backwater 
in the shadow of the People’s Republic 
of China. 
The people of Burma have said which 
they prefer. They have spoken at the 
ballot box. The threat of force must 
not be allowed to silence their choice.

NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise 
this morning, of course, to support the 
nominations of Pete Buttigieg to be 
Secretary 
of 
Transportation 
and 
Alejandro Mayorkas to head the De-
partment of Homeland Security. They 
are both exceptional choices by the ad-
ministration to fill critical positions. 
This afternoon when we vote on Mr. 
Mayorkas, it will be the completion of 
three of the four national security ele-
ments of the Cabinet for President 
Biden, having previously voted for the 
Secretary of State and Secretary of De-
fense. 
The post remaining, of course, after 
today’s actions—if they are favorable, 
and I believe they will be—is the office 
of Attorney General, and I would like 
to address that directly. 
First, let me say this. When you feel 
that you are the target of terrorists—a 
personal target of terrorists—you will 
never forget the moment. It has only 
happened twice in my life. On 9/11/2001, 
as a U.S. Senator, I was in a meeting in 
a room just several feet away from the 
Senate Chamber when the attack on 
the World Trade Center took place and 
the attack on the Pentagon. Those 
were terrorists at work, killing inno-
cent people. 
There was one more plane in the air. 
We didn’t know where it was headed. It 
was early in the morning on that day 
that we were told to evacuate the Cap-
itol Building, the first time I had ever 
faced that as a Member of Congress. 
We quickly ran out the doors and 
down the stairs and stood on the lawn 
outside of the Capitol, wondering what 
was next, for fear that this building— 
this symbol of America and its great-
ness—was the next target of an attack. 
It could have been. 
We are not sure. We never will be. 
But thanks to the heroic efforts of pas-
sengers on an airplane—they attacked 
the attackers, went after the terror-
ists, personally, and brought that plane 
down in Pennsylvania at the cost of 
their own lives—in a way, many of us 
were spared of being targets of ter-
rorism that day. 
When we reflect on those 3,000 inno-
cent Americans who lost their lives in 
New York, Pennsylvania, and at the 
Pentagon, I will never forget the feel-
ing that I was spared that act of ter-
rorism and the hope that no one in 
America would ever have that fear 
again. 
Fast forward to January 6, 2021, fewer 
than 4 weeks ago, here in the U.S. Cap-
itol. Again, I felt I was the target of 
terrorists. That was the day when an 
insurrectionist mob stormed the Cap-
itol, broke through the doors, beat 
down the windows, and came marching 
toward the Senate Chamber. I will 
never forget that moment, and I don’t 
think anyone who was here at the time 
could possibly forget it. 
It was 2:15 in the afternoon when the 
Vice President of the United States 
was removed from the chair that you 
are sitting in, Mr. President. He was 
whisked off the platform to a safe room 
so he could be spared from anything 
that might come from this mob. 
The rest of us were told to sit at our 
desk. We would make a safe Chamber— 
one safe room in the Capitol. We lined 
the walls with staffers to protect them 
against this insurrectionist mob, and 
we waited, but only for a few minutes. 
The order was reversed quickly: 
Leave the Chamber. What had hap-
pened, we came to learn, was that the 
same mob of terrorists continued to ad-
vance through the Capitol, despite the 
valiant efforts of the Capitol Police 
and other law enforcement. 
It was during that period of time 
when this mob of terrorists was attack-
ing this building, the United States 
Capitol, when Officer Brian Sicknick of 
the Capitol Police lost his life. 
We honor him tomorrow by bringing 
his remains to the Capitol for him to 
lie in repose, a place of honor, for all of 
us to thank him and his family and to 
thank all of the men and women who 
risk their lives—and, certainly, one 
who gave his life—in the service of our 
Nation. 
These men and women who stand in 
silent service every single day are 
often overlooked by visitors, but they 
are literally risking their lives. In the 
time I have served in the House and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S218 
February 2, 2021 
Senate, this is at least the third occa-
sion when members of the Capitol Po-
lice have given their lives to protect 
me, and Brian Sicknick will not be for-
gotten. 
For those who want to take this in-
surrectionist mob and the incitement 
of this mob as just another political 
protest, I ask them to reflect for a mo-
ment, please, on the graphic video evi-
dence of what happened on that day, as 
people who were part of this mob took 
baseball bats, sticks, everything they 
could get their hands on, and beat up 
against those law enforcement agents. 
It was a sad moment. 
Yesterday’s New York Times spelled 
out what led up to it: a big lie that the 
former President of the United States 
actually won the November 3 election. 
He did not. The votes were counted 
and he lost, but he has never been able 
to accept that reality, and what he has 
done in the meantime is to foment a 
revolt against our government at the 
grassroots level across America. 
That is the reason why a new Attor-
ney General brought to the position of 
leadership as quickly as possible is so 
important. I regret that, once again, I 
need to come to the floor to call on the 
Senate Republicans to stop blocking 
Merrick Garland from receiving a hear-
ing before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
We all remember the way Merrick 
Garland, a judge in the Circuit Court of 
the DC Circuit, was treated by Senate 
Republicans in 2016 when he was nomi-
nated by President Obama to the Su-
preme Court. I am not going to recount 
the entire history today, but I will tell 
you, it was not a proud moment for the 
U.S. Senate when Senate leaders on the 
other side of the aisle announced they 
would not give him a hearing. They lit-
erally would not even meet with him to 
give him the dignity of such an oppor-
tunity to discuss his nomination for 
the Supreme Court. 
But I do want to talk about the ur-
gency of putting President Biden’s na-
tional security team in place, includ-
ing Merrick Garland, the President’s 
nominee for Attorney General. Our 
country faces, as we learned on Janu-
ary 6, challenges of great importance 
at this moment in our history. 
As we faced that mob assault on the 
Capitol Building for the first time 
since the War of 1812, our Capitol was 
breached by attackers, domestic ter-
rorists. Domestic terrorists were part 
of a coordinated, comprehensive effort 
to stop the Government of the United 
States. That situation needs to be care-
fully reviewed and examined by the De-
partment of Justice and the Attorney 
General as quickly as possible. 
There is no person better qualified to 
lead this investigation, to bring these 
perpetrators to justice, and to prevent 
future domestic terror attacks than 
Merrick Garland. When he previously 
served at the Justice Department, 
Judge Garland oversaw the investiga-
tion and prosecution of the largest do-
mestic terrorism attack in recent his-
tory—the Oklahoma City bombing. His 
qualifications and experience are well 
suited for the moment we face. 
As our Nation’s top law enforcement 
officer, the Attorney General is a key 
part of the President’s national secu-
rity team. The Attorney General over-
sees our Nation’s law enforcement re-
sponse to threats both foreign and do-
mestic. 
My Republican colleagues frequently 
talked about letting the new President 
get his national security team in place 
at the start of his administration. De-
spite the unresolved nature of the Sen-
ate’s organizing resolution, other sub-
committees have come together on a 
bipartisan basis to schedule prompt 
hearings and votes for nominees, in-
cluding the Secretary of Defense, Di-
rector of National Intelligence, Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, and Sec-
retary of State. We need to do the same 
when it comes to the nomination of 
Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney 
General. 
Why would we allow partisanship to 
get in the way of national security? 
I have urged my Republican col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee— 
current Chairman GRAHAM and incom-
ing Ranking Member GRASSLEY—to 
consent 
to 
start 
the 
hearing 
for 
Merrick Garland as soon as possible. 
I proposed February 8, next Monday, 
as a hearing date, in part to accommo-
date Senator GRAHAM’s request to 
avoid holding a hearing during the im-
peachment trial. A February 8 hearing 
date gives the committee sufficient 
time to review Judge Garland’s record. 
It would follow the same timeline—the 
very same timeline—that Senator GRA-
HAM
used 
for 
Judge 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme 
Court last year. 
Remember, the committee has al-
ready received the vast majority of 
Judge Garland’s record, including his 
speeches, interviews, and publications, 
that less than 5 years ago was pre-
sented when he was nominated to the 
Supreme Court. We have had this ma-
terial in the committee for years. Sen-
ator GRAHAM claims that important pa-
perwork for Judge Garland is still 
missing. The only thing that has not 
been filed is Judge Garland’s FBI back-
ground investigation. As important as 
it is, the Judiciary Committee has 
scheduled hearings for previous Attor-
ney General nominees before the FBI 
background investigations had been 
submitted. For example, the com-
mittee received then-Senator Jeff Ses-
sions’ FBI background investigation 
just 5 days before his hearing, and we 
are still 6 days away from a proposed 
hearing date. So what we are asking is 
not unprecedented or unrealistic. 
Senator GRAHAM points out that At-
torney 
General 
nominees 
typically 
have 2-day hearings—1 day to question 
the nominee and the other day to ques-
tion outside witnesses. This isn’t al-
ways the case. For example, the Repub-
licans held a 1-day hearing to consider 
Alberto Gonzales’s nomination to be 
Attorney General. Yet, if the goal is to 
ensure there is sufficient time to ques-
tion the nominee and to hear from out-
side witnesses, I am willing to do just 
that—allow for two rounds of questions 
of the nominee and an outside witness 
panel. 
I also find it surprising that Senator 
GRAHAM objects to committee business 
on the eve of an impeachment trial. 
Just remember the history. On Janu-
ary 16, 2020—the same day that the pre-
vious impeachment trial of this Presi-
dent started—Senator GRAHAM held a 
committee markup during which the 
committee considered 11 judicial nomi-
nees. There was nothing sacred about 
the day before or day of an impeach-
ment trial then, when Senator GRAHAM 
was chairman. 
Judge Garland is a consensus pick. 
As even Senator GRAHAM has acknowl-
edged, the Senate should generally be 
deferential to a President’s Cabinet 
nominees, and that is particularly true 
for national security positions. There 
is an even greater urgency to move 
swiftly to confirm Judge Garland, 
given the events of January 6 and the 
Justice Department’s role in inves-
tigating and responding to those events 
and other national security threats. 
I hope Republicans will consent now 
to notice a hearing for February 8. It 
would show real bipartisanship and 
fairness. Under our committee rules, 
we can still notice the hearing with 
less than 7 days if my Republican col-
leagues on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee agree to do so. We need to get 
the Attorney General confirmed, and 
there is no justification for any further 
delay. 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS 
MAYORKAS 
Mr. President, while on the subject of 
confirmation, the Senate has con-
firmed Mr. Alejandro Mayorkas three 
different times. When you listen to the 
Republican Senate leader this morning, 
you may not catch that fact. He was 
second in command of the Agency he is 
nominated by President Biden to lead. 
Most recently, he served as the DHS 
Deputy Secretary, the Agency’s second 
in command, and the Chief Operating 
Officer, handling counterterrorism, cy-
bersecurity, 
border 
security, 
emer-
gency management, and other critical 
matters. We need Mr. Mayorkas’s deep 
expertise and experience in place at the 
DHS starting as quickly as possible, 
maybe even today. 
Perhaps Republicans have forgotten 
about the last 4 years of chaos at the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
Here is a reminder: Under President 
Trump’s administration, the DHS expe-
rienced an unprecedented leadership 
vacuum. The DHS lurched from one 
Secretary or Acting Secretary to the 
next—six in total—only two of whom 
were actually confirmed by the Senate. 
Those are more Agency heads in the 
last 4 years than in the 13-year history 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity before the Trump administration. 
For over a year, the Agency was led by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S219 
February 2, 2021 
unlawfully appointed Acting Secretary 
Chad Wolf. Nine days before President 
Trump left office, Mr. Wolf resigned 
and was replaced by yet another Acting 
Secretary. 
Four former Secretaries of Homeland 
Security—two Republicans and two 
Democrats—every person ever to serve 
as a Senate-confirmed DHS Secretary 
prior to the Trump administration, re-
cently endorsed Ali Mayorkas. They 
said he is ‘‘a man of character, integ-
rity, experience and compassion’’ and 
‘‘a proven leader to right the ship.’’ 
You would hardly believe that if you 
listened to some of the things said 
about him this morning on the floor. 
In 
their 
endorsement 
of 
Mr. 
Mayorkas, every former Secretary of 
Homeland Security before the Trump 
administration went on to note: The 
leadership vacuum and turmoil at the 
Department of Homeland Security may 
have contributed to the failure to an-
ticipate and adequately prepare for the 
terrorist attack of January 6 on the 
Capitol. That is the reality. After 4 
years of disorder and disarray at the 
DHS, the security of America, includ-
ing this very Capitol Building, suffered 
because of the lack of leadership under 
the previous administration. 
Mr. Mayorkas is the son of a Holo-
caust survivor and an immigrant from 
Cuba. Mr. Mayorkas knows firsthand 
that America can be a beacon of hope 
to the world and the promise to those 
who are facing persecution of a place of 
safe haven. Mr. Mayorkas is an experi-
enced national security leader who can 
restore integrity and decency to the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
I, personally, appreciated the skill 
and dedication Mr. Mayorkas showed 
as the Director of the U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services. It was in 
that post of 2012 that he implemented 
DACA, the Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals Program, which has al-
lowed more than 800,000 young people 
to contribute to America’s future. I 
won’t recount the entire history, but 
my trek on this particular issue began 
20 years ago, when I introduced the 
DREAM Act. Thanks to my friend, 
former colleague, and leader of our 
country, Barack Obama, by Executive 
order, he created DACA and gave these 
young people their chance to prove 
themselves. 
As Deputy Secretary, Mr. Mayorkas 
oversaw a $60 billion budget and led a 
workforce of nearly 230,000 individuals. 
He excelled in that role. He received 
the Department’s Distinguished Serv-
ice Award, its highest civilian honor; 
the U.S. Coast Guard’s Distinguished 
Service award; and special commenda-
tion from the National Security Agen-
cy for his achievements in national se-
curity and cybersecurity. Among his 
numerous 
responsibilities, 
Mr. 
Mayorkas led the Department’s re-
sponse to the Ebola and Zika out-
breaks—relevant and timely experience 
that he will bring to the DHS during 
this COVID–19 pandemic. 
Earlier in his career, Mr. Mayorkas 
served as the Senate-confirmed U.S. at-
torney in California. The national 
president of the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice 
enthusiastically 
endorsed 
Mr. 
Mayorkas: ‘‘His professionalism, integ-
rity and commitment to just and fair 
enforcement of the law makes him an 
ideal candidate to lead the department. 
Mr. Mayorkas has pursued criminal 
wrongdoers 
and 
has 
protected 
the 
rights of the innocent with indefati-
gable vigor. His work reflects all that 
is right in government.’’ 
Mr. Mayorkas is an outstanding 
nominee to be the Secretary of Home-
land Security. His experience, quali-
fications, deep expertise, and integrity 
will serve our Nation well in this im-
portant and challenging position. 
Steady leadership at the Department 
of Homeland Security is sorely needed 
today. I urge my colleagues to expedi-
tiously confirm Mr. Mayorkas so that 
he can serve as the next Secretary of 
Homeland Security. Today, we will get 
a chance to vote on Mr. Mayorkas. 
I sincerely hope that the Republican 
members of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee will allow us to set the stage for 
a hearing as quickly as possible for our 
next Attorney General, Merrick Gar-
land. So much is at stake. The national 
security of the United States should be 
a higher priority than any partisan 
consideration. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk about two topics today. The 
first topic I want to address is the issue 
of immigration. My good friend Sen-
ator DURBIN is very articulate—he is 
almost an expert on this issue—and I 
appreciate his comments. I want to 
just give you my perspective on immi-
gration because it is so important. Yet 
this is not why I came down here 
today. 
I love legal immigration. I think 
most Americans do. Louisianans love 
legal immigration, and I say that with 
great confidence because, every year, 
the American people invite over a mil-
lion of our world’s neighbors to become 
American citizens in a legal manner. 
We are very welcoming in this country. 
We invite more people to become citi-
zens in America than any other coun-
try in the world, and I am flattered 
that people want to come here. I mean, 
other than someone living in North 
Korea, when is the last time you heard 
of somebody trying to sneak into 
China? People want to come to Amer-
ica, and I am so proud of that fact. 
I don’t believe in illegal immigra-
tion. Some of my colleagues—not the 
Chair and Senator DURBIN—think that 
vetting people at the border is racist. I 
don’t. I think it is prudent. Every 
country does it. We respect the rule of 
law in this country, and illegal immi-
gration is illegal. Duh. I mean, if you 
don’t like the immigration laws, one 
should change them. In the meantime, 
we have to follow the law. I am not 
real crazy about traffic cameras. I 
think, in many cases, they are designed 
to just raise money, but I obey them, 
and when I get fined, I pay the fine. It 
doesn’t happen often now, but I do it. 
Look, this country needs an immi-
gration system that looks like some-
body designed it on purpose. It does. I 
think the American people deserve 
that. I would love to work with Sen-
ator DURBIN. I am not real interested 
in nibbling around the edges. I am not 
real interested in piecemealing. I am 
not real interested in some sort of 
widespread amnesty. I think we ought 
to sit down. We all ought to take our 
meds and sit down as adults and Sen-
ators in good faith, as all Senators are, 
and try to tackle this problem in a 
global way. 
I just wanted to make it clear—this 
is speaking for me, personally, and I 
have learned a lot from listening to 
Senator DURBIN as I always do—I am a 
steadfast believer in legal immigra-
tion, but I adamantly oppose illegal 
immigration. I think it is dangerous. I 
think it is unfair, especially to those 
people across the world who have wait-
ed in line patiently and followed the 
immigration laws of our country. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT SHINGLETON 
Mr. President, now let me switch top-
ics. One of the good things about poli-
tics and government—and the Pre-
siding Officer has probably had this ex-
perience—is that you meet so many in-
teresting people, and everybody is in-
teresting in his own way. I have met 
people who are more famous than wise. 
I have met people who are more wise 
than famous, and I have met people 
who are both famous and wise. One of 
the latter is what I would like to talk 
about today. He is a gentleman by the 
name of Pat Shingleton. His name may 
not be famous here—it is back in Lou-
isiana—but I can assure you that his 
virtues are. I want to honor the work 
of Pat Shingleton today. 
Pat is a Baton Rouge meteorologist, 
but he is also a longtime fixture in our 
community. He has retired. I think his 
last broadcast was Friday night. He 
had worked for 45 years. That is prob-
ably older than the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, he had 
been reporting and trying to predict— 
and had predicted with great accu-
racy—the weather in the Baton Rouge 
metropolitan community for 45 years, 
but Pat’s experience covers a whole lot 
more 
than 
being 
a 
meteorologist, 
though he was one of the best I have 
ever seen in that regard. 
During his nearly half century of re-
porting the weather, Pat not only cov-
ered more than 500 storms and hurri-
canes but he also hosted ‘‘We Play 
Baton Rouge,’’ a local game show; 
‘‘The 5th Quarter,’’ a sports show; and 
‘‘Hotline After Dark,’’ a local talk 
show, where his guests—and I am going 
to quote here—‘‘ran the gamut from 
champion bodybuilders, to beer brew-
ers, to duck callers.’’ We are a very di-
verse people in Louisiana. 
Pat has a warm heart, and he cares 
for the State and the Baton Rouge

community, and that has been on dis-
play for a lot of years. I am not telling 
my people back home anything they 
don’t already know. 
Pat is especially well known for 
being 
chairman 
of 
WBRZ—WBRZ, 
channel 2 in Baton Rouge, our promi-
nent local station, where Pat has 
worked for so long. 
Pat has worked hard as chairman of 
that station’s Pat’s Coats for Kids— 
Pat’s Coats for Kids. This program 
has—unfortunately, we have children 
in America and in Louisiana who are 
hungry and cold. You can’t learn when 
you are hungry; you can’t learn when 
you are cold. 
Pat has delivered hundreds of thou-
sands—could be in the millions for all I 
know—of coats to kids whose parents 
can’t afford to keep them warm in the 
winter. 
He has also created the Fill a Pre-
scription for the Needy project, and he 
started Baton Rouge’s St. Patrick’s 
Day parade—the Wearin’ of the Green, 
it is called—which he continues to co-
ordinate every single year. 
Pat’s final broadcast took place on 
Friday night, as I mentioned, January 
29. That does not—I can assure you, 
knowing Pat Shingleton, that does not 
mark the end of his service to the peo-
ple in Baton Rouge. I can say that with 
great confidence. 
I predict that Pat will continue to 
contribute as a community advocate 
and as a spokesperson at WBRZ. I pre-
dict he will continue to champion all of 
the charity projects that he spear-
headed for so many years. 
Now, when asked about his retire-
ment, Pat said, and I am going to 
quote, ‘‘I think we’re all given a whole 
bunch of heartbeats.’’ 
‘‘We’re all given a whole bunch of 
heartbeats,’’ Pat said, ‘‘and God gives 
us these heartbeats to do something 
good.’’ 
What an eloquent way of putting it. 
Pat has used his heartbeats pretty 
well, in my judgment. He has a lot 
more to go, but he has done it for the 
good of our State, for the good of the 
Baton Rouge metropolitan community, 
and he has done it in the newsroom, 
and he has done it outside the news-
room. 
Pat says he is going to spend the 
extra time with his family—good for 
him; he has earned it—especially his 1- 
year-old grandchild. 
Look, we are going to miss his guid-
ing hand through Louisiana’s irrev-
erent weather patterns. We may have 
to draft him back on a few occasions, 
but I want to wish him a joyful retire-
ment to soak in all the perks of being 
a grandfather. 
Pat, thank you. Thank you for your 
hard work for the people of Baton 
Rouge. Thank you for giving so much 
to the people of Louisiana for all these 
45 years. 
You are a good person, and you are a 
fine American. God bless you and your 
family. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATION OF PETER PAUL MONTGOMERY 
BUTTIGIEG 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of Pete Buttigieg’s 
nomination to lead the Department of 
Transportation. 
Whether it is rebuilding our crum-
bling roads and bridges, maintaining 
our leadership in the global mobility 
race, or improving pipeline safety, 
there is no shortage of challenges fac-
ing our incoming Secretary. 
As a fellow midwesterner, as a former 
officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve, I 
can’t think of anyone more equipped to 
take on this challenge than Pete 
Buttigieg. 
He understands the need to revitalize 
our infrastructure because he has seen 
it in our neighborhoods and on our 
roads each and every day when he 
served as a mayor. 
He has a unique understanding of 
how the Department can be a resource 
to State and to local governments and 
what can be done to ensure that the 
Federal Government supports those 
State and local governments and make 
sure that need gets addressed most ef-
fectively. 
If we are going to build back better, 
a partnership at each level of govern-
ment will be absolutely vital. Having 
someone at the helm who recognizes 
that that relationship is so important 
will be an incredible asset to the De-
partment. 
I have also had several conversations 
with Secretary-Designate Buttigieg on 
the auto industry, which is the very 
beating heart of our manufacturing 
economy. And as the industry advances 
both toward electrification and self- 
driving technologies, it will be critical 
that we support these technologies and 
make sure that they are safely de-
ployed and that they are deployed here 
in the United States. 
We have an opportunity to save lives 
but also to create jobs and empower 
our domestic auto industry to take the 
moonshot for artificial intelligence and 
spur technological innovation, and I 
am pleased that Secretary-Designate 
Buttigieg has committed to working 
with us as we craft legislation that es-
tablishes a Federal framework around 
these new technologies. 
Finally, I am excited to work with 
Secretary-Designate Buttigieg on im-
proving 
pipeline 
safety, 
especially 
around the Great Lakes. 
We know that line 5, under the 
Straits of Mackinac, poses a very seri-
ous threat to the Great Lakes. The 
Great Lakes are not only an economic 
driver and natural resource for our 
country, they are literally in the DNA 
of every Michiganian. 
As a midwesterner and as husband to 
a Michigan native who was born and 
raised in Traverse City, Secretary-Des-
ignate Buttigieg fully recognizes the 
need to protect the Great Lakes. 
I agree with Mayor Pete’s belief that, 
as he says, ‘‘good transportation policy 
can play no less a role than making 
possible the American dream.’’ 
I 
am 
proud 
to 
support 
Pete 
Buttigieg’s historic nomination, which 
has already garnered bipartisan sup-
port, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote for him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
ahead of our votes today, I wanted to 
echo the concerns that have already 
been voiced by many of my colleagues 
in this Chamber regarding the nomina-
tion of Alejandro Mayorkas to be the 
Secretary of the Department of Home-
land Security. 
At this point, we are all very familiar 
with his long legacy of service on be-
half of people of the United States, so 
I will just highlight one example of the 
‘‘value’’ that he will bring to the table 
should the Senate vote to confirm him. 
When he served as USCIS Director 
during the Obama administration, the 
inspector general was forced to inves-
tigate an ‘‘extraordinary’’ number of 
internal allegations that Mayorkas was 
granting ‘‘special access and special fa-
vors’’ to wealthy EB–5 ‘‘investor visa’’ 
applicants linked to influential Demo-
crats. 
When the IG took a closer look at the 
visa applications for three powerful 
Chinese nationals in particular, they 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
if 
Mayorkas hadn’t intervened, and I am 
quoting, ‘‘the matter would have been 
decided differently.’’ 
Now, this is something that we know 
is inappropriate. We know that this is 
something for which Mr. Mayorkas 
should be held accountable. We know 
that this is something for which he has 
not been held accountable, and here is 
what he did: He put his thumb on the 
scale, pressured his DHS colleagues— 
pressured his DHS colleagues—to break 
their own rules and turn the law on its 
head, all because a few powerful friends 
asked him to do it. He pressured others 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
some 
powerful 
friends, and it is all there for everyone 
to read in the inspector general’s re-
port, and he was never held account-
able. Yet, here we are, being asked to 
support his nomination to the Presi-
dent’s Cabinet. 
There are plenty of policy differences 
between myself and Mr. Mayorkas that 
have convinced me I have no choice but 
to stand in opposition to his confirma-
tion. But the example I just cited, in 
particular, gives me additional serious 
concerns about how his influence would 
affect the integrity of the Agency. 
Just last week, I joined several of my 
colleagues in a letter to the senior Sen-
ator from Illinois, asking him to exer-
cise his judgment as the incoming 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee and allow for a second hearing 
so we could examine Mr. Mayorkas’s 
record thoroughly because, while I be-
lieve that the President has every right 
to assemble his Cabinet, I also believe 
that the American people have every 
right to understand exactly who is

being put in charge of enforcing our 
Nation’s immigration laws and keeping 
our border secure, enforcing counter-
terrorism measures and keeping an eye 
on the country’s cybersecurity. And 
the current nominee? Never held ac-
countable for showing favor to some 
friends in high places. That is not the 
way this is supposed to be. 
I would urge my colleagues to con-
sider the American people—the tax-
payers who are footing the bill for 
every salary that is given to every in-
dividual working with the Federal Gov-
ernment. What is the standard? What 
do they expect from their leaders? 
Thereby, I oppose the nomination. 
I yield my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to support the 
nomination of Pete Buttigieg to be 
Secretary of Transportation. 
We all know the nominee as Mayor 
Pete—a man who basically came on to 
the national stage as a Midwest mayor 
who had lots of enthusiasm for making 
investments in America’s future. So 
today we are considering his nomina-
tion to be Secretary of Transportation 
at a time when we need a lot of work 
done on transportation. In my opinion, 
he is a young, energetic mayor who is 
going to help us usher in a new era of 
transportation. That means there is 
going to be a lot of bipartisan dialogue 
about how we get there. But this job 
should not be underestimated in terms 
of the importance of the transportation 
sector and the investments for the fu-
ture that we need. 
Our transportation system serves as 
a backbone of our economy, and when 
it is not doing well, the consequential 
impact of that affects our economy. It 
affects how our businesses compete in a 
global economy. It affects how people 
get to and from work, and it affects 
their home life as well. So it is a big 
job that we have, and I know that this 
mayor and future Secretary of Trans-
portation understands how big this 
challenge is. 
We have underinvested in our infra-
structure for decades. In the past 10 
years alone, we have underfunded our 
infrastructure needs by $1.5 trillion. 
The American Society of Engineers es-
timates that we need to invest $5.6 tril-
lion in our infrastructure over the next 
two decades, or the United States 
stands to lose about $10.3 trillion in 
GDP. I know this because my State 
knows this. I think the Presiding Offi-
cer knows this as well. If the transpor-
tation infrastructure doesn’t work, 
goods and services don’t get through 
your ports, they don’t get to their des-
tination, and businesses choose other 
vehicles or other avenues for the prod-
ucts to be delivered. America needs to 
be competitive. 
The American public also knows that 
poor infrastructure and the problems 
they see in their communities have to 
be addressed, whether that is concrete 
crumbling 
off 
of 
bridges, 
delayed 
trains, buses, congestion, railroads, or 
any of many issues. Just this week, a 
highway in California slid into the 
ocean, disrupting traffic along the fa-
mous Highway 1, and this could be a 
delay for months. I know, again, the 
Presiding Officer understands this as 
well as the State of Washington. Moth-
er Nature doesn’t always comply with 
our transportation needs. 
So while these investments and num-
bers may seem huge to people, it is 
what this investment will enable that 
we need to keep focused on. We need to 
focus on the fact that the United 
States makes and grows things, and we 
need to get them to their destinations. 
We need people be able to get to their 
places of employment. So we need 
someone at the Department of Trans-
portation who is enthusiastic about 
taking on these challenges and helping 
President Biden administer a new era 
of transportation and the challenges 
that we face. 
Mayor Buttigieg—a Harvard grad-
uate, Rhodes Scholar, former U.S. Re-
servist who I believe served in Afghani-
stan—also understands the challenges 
of smalltown mayors and the impacts 
that transportation systems can have. 
He knows the challenges we now face 
because of COVID–19, that there is a 
new burden on our transportation sys-
tem because of the impact of lost rev-
enue. 
State departments of transportation 
estimate $50 billion in lost revenues 
over the next 5 years. Airports have 
lost $23 billion because of people no 
longer flying. Transit agencies will 
have lost an estimated $50 billion by 
the end of 2021. These losses will con-
tinue to compound until we find the 
best way to protect our transportation 
workers, our travelers, and to continue 
to help with personal protective equip-
ment, testing, vaccines, and clear, 
health-based protocols to help return 
safety to our transportation system 
and to build public confidence. That is 
one of the reasons why we are fighting 
so hard for this next package of invest-
ments. 
President Biden took decisive action 
by mandating that people wear masks, 
which is a giant step forward in our 
transportation system. I think there is 
more we can do, and hopefully our col-
leagues can work together on that. 
The long-term revenue outlet for 
transportation also is changing, and so 
it will be a long time before its recov-
ery. 
So 
I 
believe 
that 
Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg is the right choice for this 
job because he was mayor of South 
Bend. He dealt with infrastructure 
where the rubber meets the road—man-
aging State, Federal, and local re-
sources to help build infrastructure in 
his community. 
He also helped facilitate public-pri-
vate partnerships to make the dollars 
go farther, an important model for fu-
ture investments in transportation. 
One of those projects, the South Shore 
double-track project, whose full fund-
ing grant agreement was signed earlier 
this month, is like many other State 
and local projects. The South Shore 
double track demanded impressive co-
ordination between Federal, State, and 
local governments to bring it to fru-
ition. 
Mayor Buttigieg’s Smart Streets Ini-
tiative also shows he knows how to op-
erate and succeed in the current envi-
ronment and will be able to help com-
munities around the country replicate 
the success he had in South Bend. 
He won’t be the first mayor to be the 
Secretary of Transportation, but I 
think we can say that when you have a 
mayor in that job, they are going to 
pay attention to local transportation 
infrastructure investments to help our 
communities continue to grow and be 
competitive. 
We have a major opportunity, I be-
lieve, to now deliver on the infrastruc-
ture needs of many of those commu-
nities. We should start immediately by 
talking about infrastructure packages 
and working on a transportation infra-
structure plan for the 21st century be-
cause it is clear we have opportunities 
this year, with the surface transpor-
tation programs expiring in September. 
Communities 
everywhere 
are 
de-
manding that we help work on these 
important issues for their commu-
nities, but Mayor Buttigieg will also be 
called on to think about the new era of 
transportation and how we maintain 
our competitiveness. He will have to 
think about issues of ensuring safety 
with new autonomous vehicle tech-
nologies and unmanned aircraft. He 
will have to promote stronger emission 
standards for automobiles, aviation, 
and the maritime industry. He will 
have to support the continued growth 
of electric vehicle infrastructure. He 
will have to make big investments in 
game-changing projects that will help 
us move freight more cost-effectively 
through our Nation. People will want 
to know and understand what our reli-
able passenger rail, transit systems, 
roads, and investments in bridges are 
going to be for the future. 
So all of this is a big challenge, but 
I know that this nominee is up to that 
challenge. He did well at the com-
mittee in making sure that people un-
derstood that he believes that those 
challenges need to be addressed in 
order for America to continue to move 
forward. 
From my perspective, just in the 
State of Washington, before COVID had 
really hit, we saw 78 hours per year of 
delayed traffic; that is, the average 
commuter spent 78 hours in delayed 
traffic. A recent study in my State es-
timated that Washingtonians lost more 
than $7.4 billion each year in lost time

and wasted fuel due to congestion, de-
teriorated roads, and safety problems. 
As America starts to head back to the 
office, no one wants to spend time back 
in that world of congestion, and so we 
need to make critical investments. 
People in Puget Sound know that we 
need to fix the West Seattle Bridge. 
They know in Southwest Washington 
that the Columbia River needs a new 
bridge across I–5. In Eastern Wash-
ington, they know that we need a 
north-south corridor. In Everett, they 
know that the trestle needs replace-
ment if goods from Eastern Wash-
ington are going to get to the Port of 
Everett and out the door. 
All of these things are investments, 
and with them come the structures of 
things like at-grade crossings, pas-
senger rail systems, and safety that are 
huge, I believe, infrastructure invest-
ments that have not been quite appre-
ciated. I was very pleased to get Mr. 
Buttigieg’s commitment during our 
session with him that these things—at- 
grade crossings, port competitiveness, 
and moving products safely—should be 
a big priority for the future. 
The Lander Street project in Seattle, 
which was an investment of the new 
freight program, is just a few blocks, 
but literally, congestion for hours had 
stopped traffic from getting from I–5 to 
the Port of Seattle. The Lander Street 
project in a lot of ways represents what 
it really is: a bridge to the future, a 
bridge to get people moving where they 
need to go, and the right investment, 
being competitive for the future. We 
are going to face many more delays if 
America doesn’t remain competitive. 
So I look forward to working with 
Mr. Buttigieg on all of these issues. He 
also, during the committee hearing 
process, committed that he will con-
tinue to work with Senator WICKER and 
me on important issues of aviation 
safety. He committed to us that he un-
derstood that aviation safety and the 
FAA need to continue to make re-
forms. I believe that if you want to be 
the leaders in aviation, you have to be 
the leaders in aviation safety. I think 
Mayor Buttigieg understands that will 
be a very big job of the Department of 
Transportation as well. 
I enthusiastically support this nomi-
nee. I look forward to the type of focus 
he can give to the Department of 
Transportation. This area of our gov-
ernment right now needs to address the 
COVID crisis. It needs to help us plan 
for a better transportation system of 
the future. It needs to understand that 
this transportation infrastructure and 
investment in these changes in these 
sectors—cars, planes, and passenger 
systems are all very dynamic, changing 
industries, and so our competitiveness 
will be at stake as well. 
So I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this nominee. I am sure we will 
hear a lot of discussion from him and a 
lot of bipartisan effort to help get our 
transportation system fully funded. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the 
nomination 
of 
Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg to be the Secretary of the 
United States Department of Transpor-
tation. 
I believe Mayor Buttigieg’s experi-
ence serving the people of South Bend, 
IN, as mayor and his service in the U.S. 
Navy Reserve position him well to lead 
the Biden administration’s ambitious 
infrastructure 
and 
climate-related 
agenda at the Department of Transpor-
tation. 
In 
coordination 
with 
Congress, 
Mayor Buttigieg will face numerous 
challenges as the Transportation Sec-
retary concerning issues important to 
Marylanders. 
We must reauthorize WMATA to 
maintain and improve metro rail and 
bus service to Maryland’s DC suburbs, 
develop transit solutions for Baltimore 
city and other jurisdictions throughout 
the State, and provide pandemic relief 
assistance for Maryland’s motor coach 
and transit industries not included in 
the CARES Act and for whom the most 
recent bipartisan package was only a 
down payment. 
We also should focus on repairing and 
modernizing our infrastructure, invest-
ing in local projects, working with 
other Federal partners to expand ac-
cess to broadband, addressing environ-
mental concerns such as air and noise 
pollution plaguing our communities 
from air traffic, and connecting com-
munities through the removal of aging 
infrastructure. As Secretary of Trans-
portation, Pete Buttigieg will also play 
a vital role in implementing Presidents 
Biden’s climate change agenda. 
As one of the youngest Cabinet Sec-
retaries in decades and the first openly 
gay member of a Presidential Cabinet, 
Mayor Buttigieg’s nomination presents 
an opportunity to bridge the gap be-
tween the Federal Government and 
younger generations of Americans and 
communities traditionally underrep-
resented by leadership in government. 
I am confident in Mayor Buttigieg’s 
ability to take on these urgent chal-
lenges. And I look forward to voting 
yes on his nomination and working 
closely with him in the years ahead to 
tackle the issues facing our national 
infrastructure and transportation sys-
tem.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
have the honor of serving on the Sen-
ate Homeland Security and Govern-
mental 
Affairs 
Committee—a 
com-
mittee you serve on—which oversees, 
as you know, the Department of Home-
land Security since the committee was 
first formed. 
Almost two decades later, I remain 
convinced that the nominees we con-
firm to lead that Department must 
possess sound judgment, integrity, rel-
evant experience, boundless energy, 
and the leadership skills that will en-
able them to take on some of the most 
daunting challenges that we face today 
as a nation. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is a Department with a budget of 
over $50 billion and a staff of over 
240,000 men and women. Its Agencies 
protect our country from ever-evolving 
domestic and foreign threats; they re-
spond to natural disasters; and they 
help to secure our critical infrastruc-
ture. 
Unfortunately, in recent years, the 
senior leadership ranks of this Depart-
ment have come to remind many of us 
as something akin to executive branch 
Swiss cheese, with critical positions re-
maining vacant for far too long or 
without Senate confirmation at all. In 
fact, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity has been without a Senate-con-
firmed Secretary for 21 months. Think 
about that—21 months. Meanwhile, 
there is no shortage of work to be done 
from the clear and present threat of do-
mestic terrorism to responding to the 
SolarWinds cyber breach to helping 
distribute the COVID vaccine. 
Now, more than ever, it is crucial for 
this important Department to be led by 
men and women who have been vetted 
and confirmed by Members of this 
body. The American people deserve a 
capable leader at the helm of this De-
partment, and I believe that leader is 
Alejandro Mayorkas. 
Ali represents the best of America. 
Born in Havana, Cuba, Ali knows first-
hand what it is like for a family to flee 
its native land and come to the United 
States in search of refuge. He is a man 
of integrity and a person of principle 
who possesses a truly, truly remark-
able work ethic. What is more, he may 
well be the most qualified nominee we 
have ever been asked to consider to 
lead the Department of Homeland Se-
curity. 
He has previously served admirably 
as its Deputy Secretary for nearly 4 
years, and before that as the head of 
DHS’s largest Agency, U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services. As Director 
of this Agency, he worked to combat 
immigration fraud. He directed and im-
plemented the DACA Program to pro-
tect hundreds of thousands of Dream-
ers and much more. 
As Deputy Secretary, he led the De-
partment’s successful Unity of Effort 
initiative to improve morale in an 
Agency which previously had the low-
est morale of any large Agency in our 
Federal Government. In fact, the De-
partment that reported the greatest 
improvement in morale in the final 
year of the Obama administration was 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
in large part, due to Ali’s leadership 
and that of former Secretary Jeh John-
son. 
As Deputy Secretary, Mr. Mayorkas 
also 
shepherded 
through 
Congress 
cyber security legislation to enable the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
better protect our dot-gov and private 
sector networks. I think he may have 
also had something to do with reining 
in the Ebola plague. 
Those who know Ali well will tell 
you that he is no ideologue. He has no 
partisan 
agenda. 
Rather, 
he 
is 
a 
thoughtful, policy-minded public serv-
ant who has spent much of his career 
improving the Department of Home-
land Security so that the men and 
women who serve there can better pro-
tect our homeland. 
We have seen that he is willing to 
work with Democrats, Republicans, 
and their staffs to get things done. 
That is one of the many reasons that 
five former Secretaries of Homeland 
Security, Democratic and Republican 
alike, have encouraged us to confirm 
him swiftly. 
I know that Ali can do this job. He 
has already demonstrated that. And I 
believe that many of our colleagues 
here today know it as well. After all, 
Ali Mayorkas has been confirmed three 
times in the past, including once as 
U.S. attorney for the Central District 
of Columbia. 
Having said that, though, some of our 
Republican colleagues are attempting 
now to use a 2013 IG investigation as a 
cudgel against his nomination. As it 
turns out, we have seen this movie be-
fore. I should note that a number of 
those colleagues were not serving in 
Congress at that time in 2013 and most 
were not serving on the Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee when we considered Ali’s nomi-
nation that year to serve as Deputy 
Secretary. 
I was privileged to serve as chairman 
of the committee at that time. In fact, 
I led the fight to confirm him. It was 
the toughest fight I have had in 20 
years here. It is one thing to disagree 
with the nominee politically, but to 
continue to question Ali’s dedication 
and integrity on the basis of an IG re-
port, as some of our Republican col-
leagues have done, flies in the face of 
available evidence, including his dec-
ades of public service. At a time when 
our Nation faces so many crises, we 
cannot afford less than full support for 
this nominee. 
So I want to take a few minutes 
today to set the record straight, if I 
can. Here are the facts. 
In 2013, an IG investigation into Ali 
Mayorkas’s oversight of a program 
within U.S. Citizen and Immigration 
Services, known as the EB–5 Program, 
was conducted in a highly irregular 
manner, including through false leaks 
to the media literally on the eve of his 
confirmation hearing. As a result of 
the IG’s public leaks and his failure to 
complete a report before the close of 
Congress, Ali was denied a chance to 
have any concerns fully litigated ahead 
of his confirmation in the Senate in 
2013. 
Ultimately, the IG who initiated the 
investigation stepped down later that 
year amid bipartisan calls for his res-
ignation. Last year, that same former 
IG was charged by the Department of 
Justice with 16 counts of fraud—16 
counts of fraud. 
Following Ali’s confirmation, my 
staff and I worked to ensure that the 
subsequent IG completed the report 
into any allegations. In 2015, that new 
IG, John Roth, produced a report build-
ing on the work of the 2013 investiga-
tion. The report found no evidence of 
wrongdoing by Ali. None. What it did 
suggest, however, was that some of his 
actions as Director of U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services may have 
created 
the 
‘‘appearance 
of 
favor-
itism.’’ 
In particular, it asserted that Ali 
met with a number of well-connected 
individuals over time regarding their 
concerns over the EB–5 Investor Visa 
Program. After Ali joined the U.S. Citi-
zenship and Immigration Services as 
its Director in 2009, he came to the con-
clusion that this program was not well 
run. He was not alone in this conclu-
sion. Ali has testified that as Director 
of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services, he received more complaints 
from Members of Congress, on both 
sides of the aisle, regarding the EB–5 
Program than he did about any other 
program. 
In response to these bipartisan con-
cerns, as Director of the Agency, Ali 
did what, in my opinion, many of us 
would expect an Agency head to do. He 
rolled up his sleeves, and he worked 
with his employees to gain an under-
standing of how the program was being 
run and to find out how they might 
make it run better. He directed sys-
temic changes that included improving 
management and administration of the 
program in order to reduce favoritism 
and to combat fraud. He also proposed 
reforms of the program to Congress in 
an effort to prevent future abuses—re-
forms which, unfortunately, were not 
pursued by Congress—our fault, not 
his. 
And yes, as Director, he set a prece-
dent for getting back to Members of 
Congress quickly in response to their 
inquiries, even if the answers his Agen-
cy came up with was ultimately not 
what they wanted to hear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S224 
February 2, 2021 
Completing the 2015 IG report was 
important to clear Ali of any wrong-
doing. But these findings and Ali’s ac-
tions have been mischaracterized by 
some of our colleagues who assert that 
he showed favoritism by reaching out 
personally to the staff of former Sen-
ator Harry Reid over an EB–5-related 
issue they had raised on behalf of a 
constituent. 
As it turns out, though, the report is 
clear. Ali Mayorkas did reach out to 
that staff—not to deliver preferential 
treatment but, rather, to let the staff 
know that U.S. Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services would not be able to 
accommodate the request of that staff 
and their Senator. And why? If respon-
siveness to inquiries by Members of 
Congress and their staff, regardless of 
whether the response is favorable or 
not, is a problem for my colleagues— 
any of my colleagues—that is news to 
me. 
Let me make one more point, if I 
may. As someone who knows Ali and 
has known him for years—knows his 
family, knows his work, knows his 
ethic—I believe the 2015 IG report was 
missing some needed context. Let me 
try to provide it. 
Fortunately, though, Ali provided it 
in a 32-page response. The response was 
almost as long as the IG report itself. 
Among other things, it describes how 
he met not just with Democratic Mem-
bers but with a number of our Repub-
lican colleagues to address issues im-
portant 
to 
them, 
including 
inter-
national adoption and fighting fraud in 
our immigration programs. Following 
those meetings, just as with the EB–5 
Program, Ali took appropriate steps to 
make improvements based on feedback 
from his constituents. That is what 
leaders should do. 
Those examples and others included 
right there in the 2015 IG report serve 
to further illustrate Ali’s commitment 
to doing what he thought was right, to 
improving the Department by carrying 
out the law without fear or favor, and 
by responding promptly and fully to in-
quiries from Members of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle. 
If Ali Mayorkas is confirmed today, I 
am hopeful that many of our col-
leagues and our staffs will have a 
chance in the years to come to work 
with him and his team at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and wit-
ness for themselves the kind of leader 
he truly is. We are fortunate that an 
individual as well prepared and quali-
fied as Alejandro Mayorkas may soon 
have the opportunity to lead the De-
partment through the many crises and 
challenges it faces and which our coun-
try faces today. 
But you don’t have to take my word 
for it. The late Tom Coburn, a dear 
friend of mine and former colleague of 
many of us, led the fight against Ali’s 
confirmation in 2013, when he had been 
nominated to be Deputy Secretary of 
Homeland Security. Tom was then the 
ranking member of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee, and I was serving as 
its chairman. Tom, sadly, is deceased. 
We lost a good man, a really good man, 
a couple of years ago. 
Tom’s staff director of the com-
mittee, at the time, was a very capable 
gentleman. 
His 
name 
is 
Keith 
Ashdown. I think it is important to 
note that last week, Keith sent a letter 
to our committee. In it, he wrote of his 
strong support today of Ali’s nomina-
tion to serve as Secretary of DHS. 
Mr. Ashdown wrote these words. He 
said: 
I first came to know Mayorkas when I was 
the Republican staff director of this com-
mittee [the Homeland Security committee]. 
At that time, I was working to block his 
nomination to serve as Deputy Secretary of 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
He went on to say: 
With the benefit of hindsight, I am glad my 
efforts to block his nomination were ulti-
mately unsuccessful. 
How often do you hear that? Mr. 
Ashdown went on to write: 
As Deputy Secretary, Mayorkas worked in 
a bipartisan manner to respond to the Com-
mittee’s requests and concerns. 
He added: 
Having been on the other side of this bat-
tle, I understand the importance of vetting a 
[nomination] thoroughly. But no one has 
been vetted more than has Ali Mayorkas. 
Mr. Ashton concluded with these 
words. He said: 
I urge the [United States] Senate to expe-
ditiously confirm Ali Mayorkas as [Depart-
ment of Homeland Security] Secretary with-
out delay. 
Without delay. 
Signed: 
Sincerely, Keith Ashdown. 
Let me close today, by saying that I 
am grateful, and I know that the 
Mayorkas family is grateful as well, to 
Keith Ashdown and to the Republican 
Senators who have broken ranks in 
committee and on the floor in last 
week’s cloture vote, who have taken 
the time to fully consider this nomina-
tion, and who now support it. We are 
grateful to you. I sincerely hope that 
more of our colleagues will join them 
and us today. 
I would say to my colleagues, I don’t 
stake my reputation on a lot of people, 
but I am more than willing to stake it 
on Ali Mayorkas, just as I have three 
times before in this same Chamber. If 
you are undecided today, colleagues, I 
hope you will join me this time. Ali 
Mayorkas will make us and this coun-
try proud. In fact, I believe, he already 
has. 
While we are waiting for folks to 
come onto the floor, I just want to ex-
plain to people who ask: What is this 
EB–5 Program? It is a program that is 
designed to bring foreign capital into 
this country to help build businesses 
and provide jobs in return for the abil-
ity to come to this country and eventu-
ally have legal residency here. That is 
what it is about. 
I want to say everything I do, I know 
I can do better. Every program that we 
have, even the ones that I helped to 
create, we can make them better. The 
EB–5 Program, which is a bipartisan 
program that was created, I think, 
under partnership with Ted Kennedy 
and Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, if I am 
not mistaken, wasn’t a perfect pro-
gram, and it wasn’t administered in a 
perfect manner either. 
The Constitution of our country has 
its Preamble, as we all know. It starts 
off with these words: ‘‘We the People of 
the United States, in Order to form a 
more perfect Union.’’ That is what it 
says: ‘‘We the People of the United 
States, in Order to form a more perfect 
Union.’’ 
That includes writing more perfect 
legislation and creating more perfect 
programs. When we find that they are 
not and that they are flawed, and that 
maybe some of the people who are ad-
ministering them are ill-equipped with 
their skills and technology and back-
grounds to oversee those programs, we 
have to make some changes. To those 
people whose feelings were hurt and 
those people who maybe had to find a 
different path in their careers, I reach 
out to you with a heavy heart. 
But I want to close by saying: Ali 
Mayorkas is a good man. He is a great 
nominee. He served us before, and he 
will do it again. Let’s give him our 
votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask I unanimous consent to complete 
my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of confirming Alejandro 
Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland 
Security. I appreciate my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for advancing 
this critical nomination so that we can 
finally provide the Department of 
Homeland Security with a qualified, 
experienced, 
and 
Senate-confirmed 
leader that they so desperately need. 
Mr. Mayorkas is a proven leader and 
has the experience to protect the 
American people from harm. Through-
out 
his 
confirmation 
process, 
Mr. 
Mayorkas confirmed his commitment 
to transparency and working on a bi-
partisan basis to ensure the Depart-
ment is able to take on persistent and 
emerging threats. 
And right now the threats we face are 
severe from domestic terrorism, in-
cluding the rise of White supremacist 
violence to cyber attacks from foreign 
adversaries, to tackling a deadly pan-
demic. DHS continues to face daunting 
challenges, challenges that have only 
been made more difficult to address 
due to the years of chaos during the 
previous administration. 
That is why former Homeland Secu-
rity Secretaries from both Republican 
and Democratic administrations, other 
senior Homeland Security officials, and 
law enforcement organizations have 
urged the Senate to quickly confirm 
Mr. Mayorkas—because they know he 
is well prepared for the difficult task 
that lies ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S225 
February 2, 2021 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity needs leadership, and it needs it 
now. 
By 
voting 
to 
confirm 
Mr. 
Mayorkas, this body can show every 
American that we are committed to en-
suring that they are safe and secure 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to express my support for 
the 
nomination 
of 
Mr. 
Alejandro 
Mayorkas to serve as Secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Secretary. 
His long career in public service, first 
as a prosecutor and later as Director of 
the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services—USCIS—will 
provide 
DHS 
with much needed experience, exper-
tise, and stability. 
DHS is the third largest Federal 
agency, and under the Trump adminis-
tration, it had six Directors in 4 years, 
four of whom were never Senate con-
firmed. This lack of stability at the 
leadership level, combined with the 
Trump administration’s brutal immi-
gration tactics and confrontational ac-
tions 
against 
peaceful 
protesters, 
sowed chaos and distrust in and about 
the Department. 
Mr. Mayorkas will need to meet the 
challenges of restoring moral authority 
and guiding the Department through 
this difficult time. The challenges are 
many: executing a nationwide vaccine 
strategy to combat COVID–19, com-
bating the rise of far-right, anti-gov-
ernment extremism and White suprem-
acy, and strengthening our cyber de-
fenses. I was pleased that he com-
mitted to supporting both DACA and 
TPS and working with Congress to sup-
port these communities. Maryland has 
a vibrant TPS population, with over 
6,600 TPS holders working in essential 
industries during the coronavirus pan-
demic. Congress must act to extend 
permanent protections to these indi-
viduals and ensure that they have a 
safe and secure future with their fami-
lies here in the United States. Unlike 
the previous administration, which 
torpedoed bipartisan congressional ef-
forts to pass commonsense immigra-
tion reform, I am confident that Mr. 
Mayorkas will work with Congress to 
tackle these pressing priorities. 
I was dismayed that my Republican 
colleagues 
sought 
to 
delay 
Mr. 
Mayorkas’s nomination at such a cru-
cial time. Approximately 4 weeks ago, 
domestic terrorists attacked Congress 
in an attempt to overturn the 2020 elec-
tions. Last week, for the first time, 
DHS released its first national bulletin 
warning about domestic rightwing ex-
tremism. The Department will need to 
work with the FBI and DOJ to combat 
one of the most lethal and persistent 
threats against our democracy. We 
cannot wait a minute longer, and Mr. 
Mayorkas must be confirmed imme-
diately. 
VOTE ON MAYORKAS NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Mayorkas nom-
ination? 
Mr. PETERS. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there 
any Senators in the Chamber desiring 
to change their vote 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is 
necessarily absent: the Senator from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. TOOMEY). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
TOOMEY) would have voted ‘‘nay.’’

FORTH 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
BUDGET 
FOR 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
GOVERNMENT 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021—MOTION 
TO PROCEED 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we 
all know of the crisis in America—the 
greatest economic crisis in 75 years 
since the New Deal, the greatest 
healthcare crisis in 100 years since the 
Spanish pandemic flu. Americans are 
suffering and hurting, losing jobs, busi-
nesses closing, can’t feed their fami-
lies, being evicted from their homes. 
We are in a very, very difficult situa-
tion. We cannot afford to dither, delay, 
or dilute. We need a big, bold package 
along the lines of what President Biden 
has proposed, the American relief plan. 
We hope our Republican colleagues 
will join us in offering amendments. Of 
course, as you know, as the reconcili-
ation process moves forward, it is open 
to amendments and suggestions. We 
want it to be a bipartisan proposal, but 
we also know that we must move for-
ward with the crisis in America. That 
is why today’s vote is a very good vote, 
because it sets us on the process of 
moving forward and solving this—one 
of the greatest crises America has ever 
had. 
I move to proceed to Calendar No. 4, 
S. Con. Res. 5, the concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget. 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is 
necessarily absent: the Senator from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. TOOMEY). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator 
from

FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the concurrent resolu-
tion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 5) 
setting forth the congressional budget for 
the United States Government for fiscal year 
2021 and setting forth the appropriate budg-
etary levels for fiscal years 2022 through 2030. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that for the dura-
tion of the Senate’s consideration of S. 
Con. Res. 5, the majority and Repub-
lican managers of the concurrent reso-
lution, while seated or standing at the 
managers’ desks, be permitted to de-
liver floor remarks, retrieve, review, 
and edit documents, and send email 
and other data communications from 
text displayed on wireless personal dig-
ital assistant devices and tablet de-
vices. I further ask unanimous consent 
that the use of calculators be per-
mitted on the floor during consider-
ation of the budget resolution; further, 
that the staff be permitted to make 
technical and conforming changes to 
the resolution, if necessary, consistent 
with the amendments adopted during 
Senate consideration, including calcu-
lating the associated change in the net 
interest function, and incorporating 
the effect of such adopted amendments 
on the budgetary aggregates for Fed-
eral revenues, the amount by which the 
Federal revenues should be changed, 
new budget authority, budget outlays, 
deficits, public debt, and debt held by 
the public. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of the budget 
resolution that was introduced today. 
Mr. President, let us be clear and let 
us in the Senate understand what the 
American people know all too well, and 
that is that our country is currently 
experiencing the worst economic crisis 
since the Great Depression and the 
worst public health emergency in over 
100 years. 
January marked the deadliest month 
of the pandemic, with over 90,000 Amer-
icans losing their lives as a result of 
COVID–19—90,000 
Americans 
in 
1 
month. 
In the midst of all of this, over 90 
million Americans are uninsured or 
underinsured and are unable to afford 
to go to a doctor when they become ill. 
The isolation and the anxiety caused 
by this pandemic have resulted in a 
horrible increase in mental illness, in 
depression, in anxiety, and in suicidal 
ideation. 
Today, as we speak, over half of our 
people 
are 
living 
paycheck-to-pay-
check, including millions of essential 
workers who put their lives on the line 
each and every day. More than 24 mil-
lion Americans are unemployed, under-
employed, or have given up looking for 
work, while hunger in this country— 
hunger in the richest country in the 
history of the world—is at the highest 
level that we have seen in decades. 
Because of lack of income, over 14 
million Americans are behind on their 
rent, averaging some $5,800 per family, 
and many of those families face evic-
tion all across this country. People are 
worried that when the moratorium on 
eviction ends, they are going to be 
thrown out of their homes, put out on 
the streets. Americans who worry 
about eviction understand that they 
must not join the half a million Ameri-
cans who are already homeless. 
That is some of what we are experi-
encing today. That is what the Amer-
ican people understand. 
Meanwhile, in the midst of this dev-
astation to the working class and mid-
dle class of our country, the wealthiest 
people in America are becoming much 
wealthier, and income and wealth in-
equality—a longtime problem—is now 
soaring. 
Incredibly, 
while 
families 
throughout the country are struggling 
to put food on the table to feed their 
kids during this pandemic, 660 billion-
aires—not a whole lot of people—have 
increased their wealth by over $1 tril-
lion. 
As a result of this pandemic, edu-
cation in our country, from childcare 
to graduate school, is in chaos. The 
majority of young people in our Nation 
have seen their education disrupted. 
Kids are not getting the learning that 
they need, falling further and further 
behind. On top of that, it is likely that 
hundreds of colleges will soon cease to 
exist. 
In this moment of unprecedented cri-
ses, the Senate must respond through 
unprecedented action. The budget reso-
lution we are debating today is simple, 
and it is straightforward. It will enable 
us to pass President Biden’s $1.9 tril-
lion emergency COVID relief plan 
through reconciliation with 51 votes in-
stead of 60. 
Now, I have heard from some of my 
Republican colleagues who tell us: 
Well, this reconciliation concept, that 
is a radical idea. Why are you using 
reconciliation? 
They are telling us that it is abso-
lutely imperative that we go forward in 
a bipartisan way and require 60 votes 
for passage. But I must say that when 
Republicans used this same reconcili-
ation process, I didn’t hear much about 
bipartisanship at that point. In fact, 
Republicans used the reconciliation 
process to provide trillions of dollars in 
tax breaks to the top 1 percent and 
large, profitable corporations by a sim-
ple majority vote. The only people who 
voted for that bill were Republicans— 
no bipartisanship in that bill. 
My Republican colleagues used rec-
onciliation to open up the Arctic Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge for the drilling 
of oil—once again by a simple major-
ity. The only people who supported 
that were Republicans—not one Demo-
crat. 
As we all remember, painfully, my 
Republican colleagues used the rec-
onciliation process to try to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act and throw up to 32 
million Americans off of the healthcare 
they currently have. As you will recall, 
that was a 100-percent partisan vote, 
which fortunately lost by one vote. 
Further, 
weeks—weeks—before 
a 
Presidential election, the last election, 
my 
Republican 
colleagues 
pushed 
through their nominee for the Supreme 
Court with 50 votes. That was a few 
weeks before the election. Not one 
Democrat supported that nominee—a 
totally partisan vote. 
Well, as the incoming chair of the 
Senate Budget Committee, this is what 
I believe: If Republicans can use rec-
onciliation to help the wealthy and the 
powerful and pass legislation strongly 
opposed by the American people, we 
can and must use reconciliation to help 
Americans recover from the worst eco-
nomic and public health crisis in the 
modern history of our country. In 
other words, now is the time for this 
Congress to stand with the working 
class and the middle class of this coun-
try and do what the overwhelming ma-
jority of the American people want us 
to do. 
It is worth pointing out that poll 
after poll shows that an overwhelming 
majority of Americans—over 70 per-
cent—support what President Biden 
and what we are trying to do. They 
know we have to act boldly. 
So I hope we will not hear much 
more about bipartisanship, given my 
Republican colleagues’ record on that 
issue. 
Let us be clear. The working class of 
this country and the middle class are 
facing more economic desperation than 
at any time since the Great Depres-
sion. I have to tell you that to me, 
emotionally, it was a painful sight to 
see in my own city of Burlington, VT, 
hundreds of cars lined up so that fami-
lies could get the food they needed to 
feed their kids. What happened in Bur-
lington is happening in every State of 
this country. People—many of whom 
have never had any public assistance at 
all—are lining up to get emergency 
supplies of food in order to keep their 
families alive. 
Whether it is the pandemic, which is 
killing 3,000 people a day; whether it is

February 2, 2021 
the economic collapse, which is leaving 
millions of our people destitute; wheth-
er it is the disruption of education in 
this country, which means that kids 
are falling further and further behind, 
this Congress must act and act boldly. 
For too long Congress has responded 
to the needs of the wealthy and the 
powerful and big-money campaign con-
tributors. Now is the time, in this un-
precedented set of crises, for us to re-
spond to the needs of working families, 
whether they are Black or White, 
Latino, Native American, or Asian 
American. 
It is no secret that millions of our 
fellow Americans are literally giving 
up on democracy—giving up on democ-
racy. They think that the U.S. Con-
gress and the U.S. Government does 
not care a whit about the needs of 
working people. The people who go to 
work every day, who keep our country 
going, who put their lives on the line 
during this pandemic, they look at us, 
and they say: Does anybody there in 
Washington—all you rich guys, do you 
understand what is going on in our 
lives? 
Well, this week, during this debate, 
we are not only going to begin address-
ing the health and economic and edu-
cational crises we face, but maybe, 
even more importantly, we are going to 
begin the process of restoring faith in 
the U.S. Government. Maybe, just 
maybe, we can do what Abraham Lin-
coln talked about in the midst of the 
terrible Civil War, and that is, be a 
government and act like a government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people and not just powerful special in-
terests and their lobbyists. 
What will this budget resolution 
mean for the average American? I 
know we are throwing out a lot of 
numbers; $1.9 trillion is a lot of money. 
What does it actually mean? How is it 
going to impact the lives of ordinary 
people? Let me just say a few words on 
that. 
Everybody is concerned about the 
pandemic, which has taken so many 
lives and caused so much illness and 
suffering. 
What 
this 
legislation 
is 
about is an effort to aggressively crush 
the pandemic and enable the American 
people to return to their jobs and 
schools by providing the funding nec-
essary to establish a national emer-
gency program to produce the quantity 
of vaccines that we need. We need to 
increase 
vaccine 
production, 
and, 
equally important, we need to signifi-
cantly improve the distribution of vac-
cines so that we get them into the 
arms of people as quickly as we can. 
What this legislation means is that 
during this severe economic downturn, 
we must make sure that all Ameri-
cans—low-income 
people, 
working- 
class people, middle-class people—have 
the financial resources that they need 
to live with dignity. This budget reso-
lution will allow us to keep the prom-
ises that we made to the American peo-
ple and increase the $600 in direct pay-
ments for working-class adults and 
their kids up to $2,000—another $1,400. 
I want you just to think—whether it 
is Connecticut or Vermont or South 
Carolina or anyplace else—think about, 
during this terrible crisis, what it will 
mean to an average family to suddenly 
get a check for $5,600 for a family of 
four on top of the $600 per person that 
they received a few weeks ago. Think 
about what that will mean to people 
who are losing hope right now. 
Passing this budget resolution will 
give us the tools we need to raise the 
minimum wage to a living wage of $15 
an hour, expand unemployment bene-
fits, expand the child tax credit, and 
prevent eviction, homelessness, and 
hunger. 
Passing this budget resolution means 
that during this raging pandemic, we 
will be able to provide healthcare to 
millions of Americans who are unin-
sured and underinsured by expanding 
Medicaid, improving the Affordable 
Care Act, and other approaches. 
Passing this budget resolution means 
that we will go a long, long way for-
ward to addressing the long-term prob-
lem of childhood poverty in America, 
and that is that by expanding the child 
tax credit, we have the opportunity to 
cut childhood poverty in this country 
in half and no longer be the major 
country on Earth which has one of the 
highest rates of childhood poverty. 
Let me very briefly mention a few of 
the specific provisions in the budget 
resolution that will enable the Senate 
to pass this budget under reconcili-
ation. 
First, as I just mentioned, the over-
whelming majority of the American 
people have told us very loudly and 
clearly that the $600 direct payment 
that Congress passed in December was 
a good start but is not enough. In this 
bill, we are going to increase that $600 
by another $1,400. 
We cannot continue to allow workers 
in America to work at jobs that pay 
them a starvation wage. A United 
States of America job should lift you 
out of poverty and not keep you in it. 
So let us be clear: When we increase 
that minimum wage to $15 an hour, not 
only will we be providing a much need-
ed raise for tens of millions of Amer-
ican workers, we will also, by the way, 
save taxpayers many billions of dollars 
each and every year. 
Moreover, this pandemic has caused 
tens of millions of American workers 
to lose their jobs through no fault of 
their own. For 45 consecutive weeks, 
unemployment claims have been high-
er than during the worst week of the 
great recession in 2008. This budget res-
olution that we are considering now 
will provide the funding necessary to 
provide 18 million Americans with $400 
a week in supplemental unemployment 
benefits until the end of September. 
So, if you are watching us—if you are 
watching TV now because you are un-
employed when you would rather be at 
work—understand that this bill will ex-
tend unemployment $400 on top of the 
normal unemployment your State pro-
vides until the end of September. We 
have not forgotten the unemployed. 
Further, all of us know that we have 
a childcare crisis in America. It was se-
vere before the pandemic. It is even 
worse now. This budget resolution 
would begin to provide the resources 
necessary 
to 
provide 
childcare 
to 
875,000 children in America, and it 
would expand the child tax credit from 
$2,000 to $3,000 and $3,600 for kids under 
the age of 6. In other words, we hear 
what 
working 
families 
are 
going 
through, especially those who are 
struggling and have children. This will 
be a major, major step in improving 
lives and easing anxiety for young cou-
ples with kids. 
In addition, let us not forget this 
pandemic has had a horrific toll on the 
finances of State and local govern-
ments, many of which are literally on 
the verge of bankruptcy. Over the past 
10 months, State and local govern-
ments have laid off some 1.4 million 
workers, including 50,000 in December 
alone. These are teachers, firemen, 
cops, and other municipal and State 
employees. The budget resolution that 
we are debating today will provide $350 
billion to prevent mass layoffs of pub-
lic sector workers in State and local 
governments. The Congressional Budg-
et Office has said that the best bang for 
the buck of all the money Congress has 
passed so far for COVID relief is to aid 
State and local governments. 
Further, if there is one thing this 
horrific pandemic should have taught 
all of us, it is that we must no longer 
consider healthcare as simply an em-
ployee benefit. Healthcare must be a 
human right. It is unacceptable to my 
mind that over 14 million Americans 
have 
lost 
their 
employer-provided 
health 
benefits 
over 
the 
past 
10 
months. Over 14 million workers have 
lost their health coverage, impacting 
even more people because there are 
wives and husbands and children in-
volved as well. 
This budget resolution, will, among 
other healthcare provisions, enable the 
Senate to expand Medicaid. It will 
allow more Americans to receive the 
primary care that they need through 
community health centers. It will ad-
dress the serious shortage of doctors 
and nurses in rural areas and inner cit-
ies by expanding the National Health 
Service Corps and will make sure that 
our veterans receive the healthcare 
that they have earned and deserve by 
increasing funding at the VA by $17 bil-
lion. 
In addition, in the wealthiest coun-
try on Earth, we can no longer tolerate 
hunger in America, and this budget 
resolution will enable the Senate to 
provide nutrition assistance to tens of 
millions of families struggling to get 
the food that they need—and that in-
cludes the disabled and the elderly—by 
expanding SNAP, WIC, and the Pan-
demic EBT Program. 
In America today, some 14 million 
Americans owe an average of $5,800 in 
back rent. If we do not get our act to-
gether, tens of millions of Americans 
will soon face the possibility of being

thrown out of their apartments and 
homes and onto the streets. This budg-
et resolution that we are debating will 
provide the funding for rent relief, util-
ity assistance, and mortgage relief to 
millions of tenants and homeowners 
who are in danger of eviction or fore-
closure. 
It also deals with the shame of home-
lessness in America. Today, in the 
midst of the dead of winter, we cannot 
have hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans sleeping in homeless shelters, in 
their cars, or out on the streets. And 
right here, in walking distance from 
this Capitol, there are tents located in 
parks where Americans are sleeping in 
the middle of the winter. 
This resolution provides investments 
in appropriate housing that will pro-
tect the health of our people and help 
decrease COVID–19 transmissions with 
safe and socially distant housing. 
Further, all of us must acknowledge 
that there is a pension crisis in Amer-
ica today. As a result of the greed on 
Wall Street, workers and retirees and 
multiemployer pension plans are in 
danger of seeing their retirement bene-
fits cut by as much as 65 percent. That 
is unacceptable. Promises were made 
to those workers, and the U.S. Con-
gress cannot renege on those promises. 
Not only is this $1.9 trillion emer-
gency COVID-relief package the right 
thing to do from a moral perspective 
and a public policy perspective, it is 
exactly what the overwhelming major-
ity of the American people want us to 
do. According to a recent poll from 
Change Research, nearly 70 percent of 
the American people support President 
Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID–19 plan; 83 
percent support boosting direct pay-
ments from $600 to $2,000; 64 percent 
support raising the Federal minimum 
wage to 15 bucks an hour; and 62 per-
cent of voters support additional unem-
ployment benefits. 
We are living in an unprecedented 
moment in American history. The last 
year has been a year the likes of which 
none of us have experienced in our life-
time. And the American people, who 
are living in pain, in anxiety, in isola-
tion—they are looking to the U.S. Sen-
ate, and they are saying: Are you going 
to hear and understand what we are 
going through? Are you going to do 
something to address the terrible prob-
lems in terms of healthcare, the econ-
omy, and education that we are experi-
encing? 
It is no great secret that, for many 
years, the Congress has listened very 
attentively to the needs of billionaires, 
to the needs of campaign contributors, 
and to the needs of lobbyists. Now is 
the time for us to listen to the needs of 
working families, the elderly, the chil-
dren, the sick, the disabled, and the 
poor. Now is the time to restore con-
fidence that the American Government 
works for all of us and not just the few. 
I urge passage of this important, im-
portant piece of legislation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will 
be responding to my good friend Sen-
ator SANDERS. Apparently, I will be the 
ranking member on Budget; he will be 
the chairman. And I look forward to 
finding some common ground where we 
can. Today is not that day, but hope 
springs eternal. There are things I 
think we can do on the Budget Com-
mittee that will be good for the coun-
try. 
Here is the other side of the story. 
About a year ago—a little over a year 
ago—the pandemic coming out of China 
was detected, COVID, on the west coast 
of the United States. It has just done a 
number on us as a nation. Over 440,000 
people have died from COVID-related 
infections. We finally got vaccines. 
They are in the pipeline. We need to 
get them out quicker, but I do believe 
that the vaccines are going to help us 
a lot. 
To the American people who have 
been suffering, I think better days lie 
ahead, but we are not there yet. 
But here is what is different. Feb-
ruary 2, 2021, things changed. Up until 
now, we have been able, as a Congress 
and with the White House, to pass 
things together regarding COVID. We 
passed over $4 trillion of COVID relief 
in a bipartisan fashion up until today. 
Now, how was that done? 
You had a Republican President— 
President 
Trump—working 
with 
a 
Democratic-controlled House and a Re-
publican-controlled Senate beginning 
of January—I guess, March of last 
year. Here is what we were able to do 
together. Phase 1, we approved 96 to 1 
the Coronavirus Preparedness and Re-
sponse Supplemental Appropriations 
Act of 2020. It was $8 billion. That was 
early on last year when we really 
didn’t know what we were dealing 
with. 
Then, we did $355 billion, 90 to 8. 
Then, the next was $1.9 trillion. Listen 
to this: We spent $1.9 trillion, 96 to 
nothing. So it is not like we don’t see 
a need to spend money. Ninety-six to 
nothing, this body agreed to spend $1.9 
trillion last year. 
After that, we did the paycheck pro-
tection enhancement of $355 billion by 
voice vote. It is not like people on this 
side don’t see a need. 
We 
had 
a 
continuing 
resolution 
where we added another $8 billion, 84 to 
10. 
In the omnibus, we did another $1.04 
trillion, 92 to 6. 
So when you add all this up, we have 
appropriated $4 trillion to deal with 
the problems associated with COVID— 
money for people who have been strug-
gling, money for hospitals and doctors, 
money for vaccine development and 
distribution, direct payments, the PPP 
program to keep small businesses from 
going under that can’t operate at full 
capacity. It has been a great program. 
It was bipartisan until now. 
Here is what I want the American 
people to know: We have done a lot to-
gether, and of the $4 trillion we have 
appropriated, to date, we have spent 
$2.7 trillion. 
Of the Federal Reserve actions we 
took allowing the Federal Reserve to 
help business, we had a $5.7 trillion 
market cap, for lack of a better term, 
and we have allocated $2.6 trillion. 
The bottom line is, of the $900 billion 
that we passed recently—a little over 
$900 billion—we have only spent 20 per-
cent of the money. And here we are 
being asked for another $1.9 trillion. 
What is different between the first 
$1.9 trillion and this request? When it 
was first offered, the $1.9 trillion, it 
was the largest single appropriation, I 
think, maybe in the history of the 
country since World War II. And the 
fact that 96 Senators would come to-
gether and pass it 96 to nothing tells 
you about the way we saw the problem. 
And we have been adding and adding 
and adding. 
Now we are to a point where the 
Biden administration is proposing $1.9 
trillion of additional spending. We 
haven’t spent the money we have allo-
cated—nowhere near the money we 
have allocated. And you have a bipar-
tisan group of Republicans—10—who 
went to the White House yesterday and 
said: What about a little over $600 bil-
lion? See if that is enough. 
I am afraid the answer is going to be 
no. 
So what has happened here? Demo-
cratic colleagues have won the White 
House. And Biden is President; he won. 
It is a 50–50 Senate. The Vice President 
makes 
it 
a 
Democratic-controlled 
body, to the extent that the Vice Presi-
dent breaks ties. And you have a small-
er majority in the House than we have 
had in the last 20 years. But the con-
sequence of what I have just described 
is that my Democratic colleagues are 
now in charge of everything. 
When it was divided government— 
when you had a Republican President, 
a Republican Senate, and a Democratic 
House—we were able to come together 
with overwhelming votes to help the 
American people. Now we find our-
selves at a crossroads. Our Democratic 
colleagues are using a process called 
budget reconciliation that begins today 
that would allow them to pass the $1.9 
trillion basically on a party-line vote— 
a simple majority, not reaching the 60- 
vote milestone. 
The 60-vote problem was never a 
problem up until now because Repub-
licans and Democrats were able to 
work together up until now. What 
changed? They have got it all. Every-
thing we told you would happen in the 
election is coming true. You have one 
party in control of Washington, and 
they are seizing the moment. 
What a $15-an-hour minimum wage 
has to do with fighting COVID, I don’t 
know. But I do know this, now is the 
worst possible time to increase the cost 
on small businesses in South Carolina 
in the restaurant-hospitality industry. 
You are about to hit them with two 
government mandates that are going 
to put them out of business. They are 
all struggling. 
A lot of States have reduced capa-
bility in terms of indoor dining. DC, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S229 
February 2, 2021 
think last week, for the first time, you 
could dine indoors at 25-percent capac-
ity. States all over the country have 
different rules about how small busi-
ness operates. 
The tourist industry is just about 
squashed. So people in the hospitality 
industry, in the restaurant business, 
and in the service industry, if this bill 
passes the way it has been proposed, 
are going to have a $15-per-hour per- 
employee mandate. That is going to 
sink them. They are going to have to 
lay a lot of people off because they are 
barely making it as it is. 
Here is what we are doing to those 
businesses. State and local govern-
ments are mandating a reduction in 
revenue. Why? Because you reduce the 
capability to earn money by reducing 
seating capacity and the other things 
associated with fighting COVID. So 
what does the Congress do? Do we re-
lieve that burden by having more PPP? 
No. We increase your cost of doing 
business. 
This $15-an-hour minimum wage in-
crease will dramatically increase the 
cost of doing business to small busi-
nesses at a time they can afford it the 
least. There are people out there work-
ing today that will be out of work to-
morrow if this bill passes. 
My 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
taken the energy sector head-on. They 
stopped the Keystone Pipeline. I don’t 
know how many thousands of jobs 
would be affected by that. But all of 
these 
mandates 
and 
all 
of 
these 
changes in policies are making it real-
ly hard right now to employ people. 
So count me in for more COVID relief 
once I understand how the money we 
have previously allocated has been 
spent. 
I think continuing to spend at this 
level, without understanding what the 
money in the past has done, is not very 
responsible. We have only spent 20 per-
cent of the $900 billion we passed just a 
few weeks ago. Now we are going to do 
$1.9 trillion more? 
Of the $4 trillion we did together, $2.7 
trillion has been spent. Over $1 trillion 
is sitting there not spent yet. 
So I guess the point I am trying to 
make, and my Republican colleagues, 
is that this $1.9 trillion package, there 
has been no effort to make it bipar-
tisan. We are spending a lot more 
money before we understand how the 
money we spent actually works. And 
some of the policy provisions in this 
package, I think, are going to do more 
damage to the economy that is strug-
gling to get back on its feet than good. 
But they have the power, and they are 
using it. 
He is right, Senator SANDERS. When 
we had this authority, we cut your 
taxes through budget reconciliation. 
That is what we did, so it is not like 
Republicans haven’t used this process. 
Democrats used it pretty much to pass 
ObamaCare. But this is one area where 
there has been pretty much a common 
view of things. 
Taxes are different between Repub-
licans and Democrats. Who decides 
what healthcare you get—there are 
some people like my good friend from 
Vermont 
who 
wants 
single-payer 
healthcare. That is one way of doing it. 
I just disagree. Everything is about 
trying to help people. I don’t doubt the 
motives; I just doubt where we are 
headed is a good outcome for the Amer-
ican people. 
So the bottom line is, up until now, 
we have had bipartisanship when it 
comes to COVID relief. The reason that 
bipartisanship has stopped is because 
we have one party in control of the 
U.S. Senate, the House, and the White 
House. 
Here is what I think: That is going to 
end not well because it is not like we 
don’t want to help people; we just have 
a different view of how to help. And we 
would like to let some of the money we 
have already appropriated go to work 
and see how well it works and fill in 
gaps where you need to fill in gaps. 
Count me in for more payments, di-
rect payments, beyond $600. Count me 
out for giving $2,000 payments to peo-
ple who make almost $200,000 a year. I 
think it needs to be more targeted. I 
don’t mind having more direct pay-
ments; I would like to make it more 
targeted. And I don’t mind discussing 
raising the minimum wage when the 
COVID problem passes and we get back 
on our feet; I do mind doubling it in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
And I do believe that this $1.9 trillion 
package is going to do more harm than 
good to the American economy. 
The reason we are having this debate 
the way we are having this debate is 
because they have unlimited power, my 
Democratic colleagues. 
You have chosen to do this. The 10 
Republicans who went down to the 
White House—I appreciate their effort. 
Maybe some good will come from that. 
But this process we are engaged in 
today makes me wonder if it was worth 
their time. Maybe we can pull a rabbit 
out of the hat and find a bipartisan 
compromise consistent with what we 
have done over the last year. If not, we 
are going to march down the reconcili-
ation road. We are going to take $1.9 
trillion of spending and let one party 
spend it. We are going to have one 
point of view about this money. We are 
going to let people spend $1.9 trillion 
without any input from the other side 
of the aisle, in a 50–50 divided Senate. 
I don’t know what you got from the 
last election. Here is what I got: We did 
better in the House than I thought we 
would do; President Trump lost, but it 
was still a close election from an elec-
toral college point of view; and the 
Senate is 50–50. I don’t think the mes-
sage from the last election was ‘‘We 
want Democrats to spend $1.9 trillion 
and deal Republicans out.’’ That is ex-
actly what you are doing. 
It would be different if we had had a 
history over here of trying not to help. 
We were able, 96 to 0, to spend $1.9 tril-
lion less than a year ago. And now we 
want to spend $1.9 trillion again—after 
the money previously allocated hasn’t 
been spent? 
All I am suggesting to my Demo-
cratic colleagues is, we are going to 
have a different view on taxes, and we 
are going to have a different view on 
healthcare, but this is the one area 
where I really do believe there is a bi-
partisan middle ground to be had. 
To Senator SANDERS, there may come 
a time where I will work with you to 
raise the minimum wage. 
The PPP program has been highly 
successful. The $600 billion proposal by 
Republicans has more money for that. 
It has more direct payments, but it is 
more targeted. 
Senator MANCHIN said that he wants 
more direct payments, but he wants it 
targeted to people on the lower eco-
nomic end. 
MIKE ROUNDS—one of our colleagues 
from South Dakota—got a check. 
The bottom line is, I don’t mind help-
ing people, but there has to be some 
sense that we can’t just constantly 
write checks and hope one day that 
doesn’t come back to bite us. 
One thing about a $15-an-hour min-
imum wage now—I think what it does 
is put pressure on businesses that can’t 
stand any more pressure. It is going to 
cost people jobs that have a job. It is 
going to do more harm than good in 
this environment. 
When you combine the mandate of 
increasing wages where the $15 an hour 
is the least wage and add what we are 
doing in terms of restricting income 
generation, that is a formula for dis-
aster for small businesses. 
This is it. If this bill passes the way 
it is written, there are going to be 
thousands of people out of work who 
were previously working in a small 
business that is going to fold. How does 
that help COVID? 
If you don’t believe that, you are not 
really walking and talking to the peo-
ple out there on the frontlines of this 
economy. The tourism industry in 
Myrtle Beach, SC, has been decimated. 
You can’t fly from one State to the 
other without a 2-week quarantine. 
Hopefully, that will begin to pass when 
we get vaccine distribution at a higher 
level. But people along the coast of 
South Carolina in the hospitality tour-
ism business are hanging by a thread. 
The PPP program has been a lifeline. 
The last $900 billion package had a new 
round of PPP money. If we need more 
money, count me in. Again, I would 
like to have a higher direct payment 
but not to people who make $150,000, 
$200,000 in combined income. 
This package is going to be dev-
astating to the hospitality service in-
dustry. It is going to take us down a 
path we haven’t gone before, which is a 
partisan approach to COVID. And I do 
believe—and maybe I am wrong—that 
with some effort on our part, we can 
reconcile the difference between what 
our Republican colleagues proposed 
and what President Biden has proposed 
and find some middle ground like we 
have in the past, but there doesn’t 
seem to be a real effort to do that. 
All I can say is that the American 
people want us to work together for

their benefit, and this will be the first 
time that I can recall where we have 
spent $1.9 trillion based on one party’s 
view of things. That is not good. That 
is a lot of money—and it is so unneces-
sary. 
I would encourage Senator SANDERS 
and my colleagues on the other side to 
give a chance to this negotiation and 
see if we can get there. I hope we can, 
but this is not the right way. What we 
are doing today is going to set into mo-
tion partisanship where there was pre-
vious bipartisanship. 
President Biden said he wanted to 
unify the Nation. You have picked the 
one topic that we have been pretty uni-
fied on, and you are going to disrupt 
that unification. 
The first COVID package had a $600 
Federal supplement to State unem-
ployment benefits, and I looked at 
that. My family was in the restaurant 
business. Senator SANDERS gave statis-
tics about support of the public. You 
are literally paying people more not to 
work than work. 
I want to help people because they 
are out of work—no fault of their own 
because of COVID—but when we went 
to $600, we were paying people $23 an 
hour, I think, in South Carolina not to 
work. That did not go over well with 
the public at large. We are trying to re-
duce that Federal supplement down to 
$300, not $600, to help people who are 
out of work but not to incentivize peo-
ple not to go back to work when the 
economy is beginning to open. 
In this package, we go back to $400, 
and it goes all the way to September, 
which means it is going to be harder to 
hire people back when the economy 
does show signs of reopening. And it is 
beginning to show signs of coming 
back. The faster the vaccine is distrib-
uted, the more people who get inocu-
lated, the sooner we can go back to 
business. 
I would just say to my Democratic 
colleagues: You have chosen this path. 
All of us are going to vote no to $1.9 
trillion in spending—not because we 
don’t care; it is because we would like 
to see what the money we spent in the 
past is doing before we add another $1.9 
trillion. 
A lot of the provisions in your pro-
posal, we think, have very little, if 
anything, to do with COVID, and it 
would be unfortunate if we go down 
this road. But we are not in charge. 
Now, 2022 will be here before you 
know it. Hopefully, by 2022, we will 
have the American people build up im-
munity to COVID, and our economy 
will come back the way it was before 
the COVID pandemic. Before the pan-
demic, the economy was doing well for 
all sectors of the American people. I 
think one of the things that helped was 
that tax cut that Senator SANDERS op-
posed. But we can have political de-
bates about that. 
The point I am trying to make is, up 
until this moment in time, we have 
been able to achieve overwhelming bi-
partisan 
support 
dealing 
with 
the 
COVID problem that we all face. It 
really is disappointing and disheart-
ening that we are going to abandon 
that model when I don’t think we have 
to. But that will be up to my Demo-
cratic colleagues. That will be up to 
President Biden. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
And finally, a message to President 
Biden: You won; we lost. You are the 
legitimate President of the United 
States. I want to help you where I can. 
I just got a briefing about what you are 
proposing in Afghanistan. I think it is 
darned good. 
There are plenty of things we can do 
around here together—on foreign pol-
icy and domestic policy. It doesn’t 
have to be a fight to the death all the 
time. 
The infrastructure bill is there for 
the taking. I think most Americans re-
alize our roads and our bridges and our 
ports need upgrading, and count me in 
for that. There are things that we can 
do. 
President Biden, you can do some-
thing too. You can say: Slow down in 
the Senate. Slow down in the House. I 
am going to see if I can find middle 
ground. 
I am telling you right now that $1.9 
trillion being spent the way this bill 
envisions 
is 
not 
responsible. 
We 
haven’t spent the money we have pre-
viously allocated. There is a lot in this 
bill that will cost jobs at a time we 
need jobs, and you are not going to 
help the COVID crisis by putting some-
body out of work because of a govern-
ment mandate that business can’t af-
ford to fulfill because they are hanging 
by a thread. 
We will have some time in the next 
couple of days to talk about what is in 
the package, what is not, our view of 
how this thing should all unfold. I will 
yield back here with a sense of opti-
mism. 
To my Republican colleagues who 
went to talk to the White House, count 
me in. If you can work something out, 
I would like to be able to help. It is not 
like there is not some more money 
that can be spent, but this approach— 
the way you are spending the money, 
the amount of money in this approach, 
I think, is going to make this place less 
unified. If you are looking for unity, 
this is a lousy way to get it. 
With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we have 
already begun to hear a little revi-
sionist history with respect to this cru-
cial issue. There was exactly one 
amendment on the CARES Act, and 
that amendment, supported by almost 
every Senator on the other side of the 
aisle, basically would have blown up 
the law that I put special focus on be-
cause it was deemed the only way to 
get expanded unemployment benefits 
out to folks in a timely way. 
We were told that there was all this 
bipartisanship. Yet on the crucial 
issue, that wasn’t the case because that 
benefit, in particular, is what helped 
scores and scores of communities all 
across the country stay afloat because 
that money was spent locally. It was 
spent on rent. It was spent on gro-
ceries. And most of all, it was weekly. 
Yet there was exactly one amendment 
on the original legislation, and that 
one amendment was to blow up the 
only way to get checks out to folks rel-
atively quickly—point No. 1. 
Point No. 2, these were not folks who 
didn’t want to work. They were told by 
their government—told by their gov-
ernment—that they really needed to be 
at home to deal with the virus. These 
folks want to work; there is no ques-
tion about it. 
We are going to talk about this, I 
imagine, in this debate, but study after 
study has shown that the expanded un-
employment during this period was not 
a disincentive to work. There is just no 
evidence of that. In fact, when we look 
at crucial periods of time when people 
might have stayed home, they were 
rushing to get back to work. 
We are going to discuss this, and I 
am going to start the debate now on 
where we are at this moment because I 
think this discussion comes down to a 
simple proposition; that is, whether 
millions of workers and their families 
should have to spend years and years 
living in the wreckage of the COVID 
economy. The jobs recovery for mil-
lions is going in reverse. 
Millions of Americans have lost jobs 
through no fault of their own. Maybe 
they were working at the airport. 
Maybe they were tending bar. Maybe 
they were teaching our kids when the 
worst pandemic—the worst pandemic 
in a century—swept the United States. 
They didn’t do anything wrong. 
The question now is whether the U.S. 
Senate is going to step in with big poli-
cies to actually be of help to them or 
whether it is going to quit on those 
workers when they need a modest 
amount of assistance until everybody 
gets vaccinated. 
President Biden has a strong, focused 
plan that is going to meet the moment, 
get relief to workers in the middle 
class, and kick-start the jobs recovery. 
The plan that was brought forward yes-
terday 
by 
10 
Republican 
Senators 
doesn’t come close to meeting that bar. 
The debate isn’t a whole lot more 
complicated than that. I am glad that 
there is some agreement on both sides 
for funding vaccines. Yet the economic 
divide in this debate is very clear. 
Here are the key facts as we start 
this discussion. The independent ex-
perts at the Congressional Budget Of-
fice released a new report yesterday 
that shows how long-lasting this jobs 
crisis is really going to be. According 
to the Budget Office, it could be more 
than 5 years before the unemployment 
rate even begins to approach where it 
was a year ago. 
Millions of workers could stay stuck 
on an economic tightrope, worried 
about eviction, worried about going 
hungry, wages to flatline for the better 
part of the decade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S231 
February 2, 2021 
Americans know what happens when 
Congress takes its foot off the gas, 
slows down the recovery, because that 
is what happened a little bit over a dec-
ade ago—12 years exactly. The great re-
cession hit, but in early 2009, the Sen-
ate decided, we are going to go small. I 
was around. Everybody was told: You 
know, not so bad if you go small be-
cause the Senate will get a second bite 
at the apple. Nobody ever got a second 
bite at the apple, and workers suffered 
and suffered some more. In my home 
State, it took 71⁄2 years in Oregon for 
the unemployment rate to fall back to 
where it was before the recession. 
Recent history tells us you have to 
go big. We are hearing from economic 
experts telling the Senate to go big. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen, fresh off 
her unanimous, 26-to-0 vote in the Fi-
nance Committee, and Fed Chair Pow-
ell are saying: Go small and you make 
a big mistake. 
That is why the outline that a group 
of my Republican colleagues brought 
forward this week just does not get the 
job done. It is the same playbook as 
2009, and it leaves too many workers on 
the economic tightrope for years to 
come. 
The budget resolution before the Sen-
ate has some big solutions on the econ-
omy and for our workers. Right off the 
top, it makes investments in vaccines 
and care that is needed to end the pan-
demic as quickly as possible. This is 
the No. 1 way to get the lives of Ameri-
cans back to normal. It is not going to 
happen overnight. 
In the meantime, our economy needs 
another rescue package. That is what 
the resolution, the budget resolution, 
essentially sets up. It is hard to figure, 
when you are at home, all of the 
legalese and lingo, but now we are real-
ly dealing with the lives and the well- 
being of the American people, and this 
is what starts us in the right direction. 
Here are three examples of why this 
resolution is so important. 
First, it sends big financial support 
to jobless Americans. There is not 
going to be a full jobs recovery as long 
as it is unsafe to go to restaurants in-
doors or go to conventions or pack fans 
in the basketball arenas. Those work-
ers need help. 
As I mentioned when we heard a lit-
tle revisionist history on the expanded 
unemployment earlier, as the ranking 
Democrat on the Finance Committee, I 
negotiated the $600-per-week boost and 
expansion of unemployment insurance 
last year in the CARES Act. It was an 
economic lifesaver for workers who 
used that money to pay rent, to buy 
groceries, and to cover the cost of med-
icine. I still have those workers come 
up to me and say: RON, I heard about 
what was going on in the Senate. You 
all gave me the money to pay for my 
car insurance, because if I didn’t have 
that car insurance, life in our family 
would just fall apart. 
So contrary to what we heard ear-
lier—and during the course of this de-
bate, I am going to put several studies 
into the RECORD. There has never been 
hard evidence that enhanced, expanded 
unemployment benefits in any way 
held back the recovery. In fact, when 
enhanced unemployment benefits ex-
pired last summer, the job recovery ac-
tually slowed down. 
In December, our colleagues on the 
other side extended unemployment in-
surance just to mid-March, and they 
cut the additional benefit in half. I be-
lieve that was also a big mistake. Be-
tween the worst economy since World 
War II and the pandemic entering its 
second year in America, you couldn’t 
find a worse time for Senators to start 
nickel-and-diming 
workers—hard-hit 
workers—out of the relief they so des-
perately need. 
As I noted, there was just one vote, 
only one vote in the original CARES 
package, and that vote was led by my 
colleagues who would have blown up 
the only way to get benefits in a rel-
atively quick way out to millions of 
workers. 
In my hometown, the average rent 
for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,750. 
Traditional unemployment insurance 
benefits don’t come anywhere near 
paying that rent. If you are a single 
parent trying to raise one or two kids, 
even with the expanded benefit, you 
are barely making ends meet. If you 
are a two-income household, it can also 
be a big struggle. Nobody is going out 
buying boats with their unemployment 
insurance benefits. They are spending 
it at corner stores, local markets, 
going to the pharmacy, paying for med-
icine for kids who aren’t feeling well. 
The budget resolution before the Sen-
ate calls for a 6-month extension with 
an extra boost of $400 per week. It is a 
proposal that I support. In later pack-
ages, I want colleagues to know, I am 
going to keep pushing for the full $600. 
And I believe that Congress ought to 
tie the extension of unemployment 
benefits to economic conditions in our 
communities, to economic conditions 
on the ground. It is just common sense. 
Unemployment insurance works best 
when it covers all workers, when it 
pays an adequate benefit, and when 
Members of the U.S. Senate can’t 
politicalize it by setting arbitrary 
dates and setting up cliffs when people 
are going to get cut off of those bene-
fits. 
Second, the budget resolution helps 
bring back jobs. The RESTAURANTS 
Act is a vital jobs program. It will save 
a lot of jobs in one of the industries 
hardest hit by the pandemic, and it is 
particularly important because a lot of 
restaurants weren’t able to take advan-
tage of the PPP, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. 
Another key jobs proposal that is 
part of this resolution is help for 
States and localities. I want to make 
something clear for the record about 
State and local funding because this 
has been attacked by our colleagues on 
the other side since last March. I would 
bet my last dollar that somebody will 
come down to the Senate floor this 
week and rail about the so-called blue 
State bailout and say it is all waste. 
That is nonsense. 
State and local funding is first and 
foremost about jobs that are a lifeline. 
It is about firefighters. It is about road 
crews. It is about sanitation workers. 
It is about public health employees. It 
is about teachers. It has nothing to do 
with red States or blue States; it is 
about saving people’s jobs in commu-
nities across the country, and those are 
jobs where they are out saving people’s 
lives. Nearly 1.5 million of these essen-
tial workers have already lost their 
jobs since the pandemic began, and un-
less 
Congress 
provides 
funding 
to 
States and localities, even more will be 
laid off this year. 
Third, the budget resolution is going 
to put money into the pockets of work-
ing families and the middle class. The 
fact is, tens of millions of American 
families are literally one financial set-
back away from devastation. That 
should have been clear before the pan-
demic. There is certainly no denying it 
today. 
Increasing relief checks to $2,000 is 
going to help, especially because so 
many workers have lost hours or taken 
lower paying jobs than they had a year 
ago. But the budget resolution also in-
cludes fresh ideas from President Biden 
and colleagues on this side to increase 
family incomes—first and foremost, ex-
panding the earned income tax credit 
and the child tax credit. In my view, 
this is long overdue. 
People always ask, well, what is it 
really going to do? What is it going to 
do that is meaningful to our country? 
What we are told is that effort is going 
to cut child poverty in half. Just try to 
put your arms around that. 
When you go home to talk to folks 
and they ask, hey, what is going on 
there, you can say, I am part of an ef-
fort—a sensible effort which for many 
years had some real Republican sup-
port—I am supportive of an effort to 
cut child poverty in half, give millions 
and millions of families a chance to get 
ahead. It sure sounds to me that a pol-
icy like that is a no-brainer. 
I am going to close by briefly ad-
dressing arguments I have heard com-
ing from the other side. 
First, I heard a number of Members 
say that the price tag is too high. Well, 
I will tell you, if you voted for Donald 
Trump’s deficit-financed handouts to 
multinational corporations and billion-
aires, you cannot credibly argue that 
the relief for workers is fiscally reck-
less. And the fact is, the deficit isn’t 
going to get better until unemploy-
ment comes down and the economy 
gets back to strong and consistent 
growth. 
Second, I have heard some Senators 
suggest that the budget resolution is 
bad for unity. My answer to that is, the 
only place where big, bold economic re-
lief is a divisive proposition is within 
the four walls of the U.S. Senate. We 
have seen the polls—overwhelming sup-
port for these key positions, the key

policies that are part of this budget 
resolution. I would submit to my col-
leagues, the only place where there is 
really a strong division on the value of 
this budget resolution is within the 
four walls of the Senate. 
The last point is a little bit personal. 
The President of the Senate and I have 
known each other a lot of years. We 
worked very closely in the other body 
and here. I, over time, have gotten a 
fair amount of flak for sometimes 
being too bipartisan, doing too much to 
try to bring both sides together. I al-
ways will say—always—it is better if 
you can find common ground. 
But calls for unity aren’t supposed to 
be a political baseball bat where you 
club somebody. They are supposed to 
be real. They are supposed to be about 
finding common ground, not about 
stalling for the sole purpose of stalling. 
What you see in this budget resolu-
tion is exactly the kind of plan that 
Americans voted for and the over-
whelming majority of Americans sup-
port. That is why I am strongly behind 
this resolution. 
As a senior member of our party on 
the Finance Committee, I am looking 
forward to a lot of debate on this issue. 
That is why I felt it was important to 
step in when we heard some revisionist 
history from the other side that there 
hadn’t been any partisanship. There 
sure was on that very first vote on the 
CARES Act. 
This is an important debate. What is 
really most important is that while we 
continue to listen to our colleagues on 
the other side, while we continue to 
reach out, which I am committed to do, 
the U.S. Senate get this job done be-
cause there is too much economic hurt 
in America to do otherwise. 
We have another unemployment cliff 
coming in just a few weeks. Tech-
nically, the date is March 14. That is 
when the next round of unemployment 
expires. I really think we have to get 
this done by the beginning of March. 
There is no time to waste. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
resolution, as I will. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to bring up the point 
that there must be equal attention to 
the dangers of extremism, whether it is 
extremism of the right or extremism of 
the left. 
We have all been horrified by the 
senseless criminal acts that occurred 
at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 of this 
year. A violent mob was able to over-
run Capitol Police and quickly gain ac-
cess to the area where a joint session of 
Congress was being held. Five people, 
including a Capitol Police officer, died 
as a result of this attack. 
I hope that together, Republicans 
and Democrats, we can get to the bot-
tom of what occurred on that day and 
ensure that it never happens again. 
In the spirit of collaboration, I must 
direct everyone’s attention to some-
thing that has occurred to me, and that 
is the need to condemn all political vi-
olence regardless of ideology. Like 
many Americans, I have been deeply 
troubled by the rioting, looting, anti- 
police attacks, and deaths that have 
occurred this summer. 
While many very legitimately pro-
tested the death of George Floyd in a 
peaceful manner, consistent with their 
rights under the First Amendment, 
thousands of others did not do it in a 
peaceful manner and probably did it for 
a lot of other reasons than just George 
Floyd’s death. One of the most upset-
ting aspects of the violence of this 
summer has been how it has targeted 
innocent 
law 
enforcement 
officers. 
Over 700 officers were injured between 
May 27 and June 8, 2020. This number is 
likely underreported as nearly 300 of 
those injuries occurred only in New 
York City. 
Acting Deputy Homeland Security 
Secretary Ken Cuccinelli testified at a 
hearing in front of the Judiciary Sub-
committee on the Constitution that 
there had been 277 Federal officer inju-
ries at the Federal courthouse in Port-
land, adding further to that total pre-
viously given to you. Officers were as-
saulted nightly there for months— 
slashed, hard objects thrown at them, 
struck with objects like hammers and 
baseball bats, even blinded by lasers. 
In another offensive, 60 Secret Serv-
ice officers were injured during a sus-
tained attack on the White House, 
which caused then-President Trump to 
be taken to a secure bunker. The 
church across the street from the 
White House was lit on fire as part of 
that continued assault. Over 300 people 
were charged federally for their roles 
in these weeks and months of violence. 
Eighty of those charges related to the 
use of arson and explosives. Others in-
volved assaults on officers and the de-
struction of government property. 
However, the nationwide riots, which 
broke out in nearly every major city in 
the country, were predominantly State 
offenses. At least 14,000 people were ar-
rested in 49 cities. At least 25 people 
died in violence related to the riots. 
Property Claim Services—a company 
that tracks insurance claims relating 
to riots and civil disorders—estimates 
that the insurance losses from the 
summer’s civil unrest ‘‘far outstrip’’ 
all previous records to possibly exceed 
$2 billion. 
It has been a relatively frequent 
sight at the summer’s violent events to 
see individuals acting in coordination 
in all black bloc, holding the ‘‘A’’ sym-
bol of antifa. An admitted antifa adher-
ent in Portland murdered a conserv-
ative protester. Antifa supporters have 
been charged federally for promoting 
riots and using Molotov cocktails. 
While that violence has slackened now 
since President Biden’s electoral vic-
tory was declared, it has far from 
abated. Antifa rioters attacked the Or-
egon Democratic Party’s headquarters 
on inauguration day itself. The far left 
of this country continues to believe vi-
olence will get more attention for their 
causes even after a Democratic victory 
win for the White House. 
Much of the violence of the summer 
was specifically investigated by the 
FBI as domestic terrorism. FBI Direc-
tor Chris Wray provides statistics on 
domestic 
terrorism 
in 
his 
annual 
threats testimony. He has previously 
testified that 900 to 1,000 domestic ter-
rorism investigations exist at any 
given time. There are also about 1,000— 
what they call—homegrown violent ex-
tremism 
investigations. 
These 
are 
cases in which an entirely U.S.-based 
person without direct contact with a 
foreign terrorist organization is moti-
vated by the global jihadist movement, 
and, of course, there are thousands 
more international terrorism inves-
tigations. 
Former U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy 
Cox testified in a subcommittee hear-
ing that over 300 domestic terrorism 
cases were opened due to the violence 
just this past summer. This is a signifi-
cant increase in the ordinary amount 
of domestic terrorism in the United 
States. That this violence occurred— 
and the facts and the figures that sur-
round it—should not be news to any-
one. However, I must admit that I have 
been extremely surprised by the re-
sponses of Democratic Members to this 
violence. 
For weeks and months, the most con-
sistent response seemed to be to deny 
the violence was occurring at all. I saw 
JERROLD NADLER on TV—the chairman 
of the House Judiciary Committee— 
deny that antifa itself was real. In a 
nationally televised debate with then- 
President Trump, then-Candidate Joe 
Biden wrongly stated that antifa was 
only an ‘‘idea.’’ This is even after FBI 
Director Wray had already testified to 
Congress that antifa was absolutely a 
‘‘real thing’’ and that the FBI had 
cases and investigations against those 
calling themselves ‘‘antifa.’’ 
It seems that some Democrats are 
living in a different world than those 
who have seen businesses boarded up, if 
not burned out, images of violence in 
the streets, and terrifying attacks on 
police officers. When the violence was 
admitted by those same people, it 
seemed to have been condoned rather 
than condemned. 
Now, Vice President HARRIS
pre-
viously said: 
They’re not going to stop, and everyone, 
beware. [ . . . ] And they should not, and we 
should not. 
You have seen that quote many 
times on various TV channels. Our new 
Vice President did not disclaim the ri-
oting and unrest and direct her fol-
lowers only to lawful action. 
Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY
stated: 
‘‘There needs to be unrest in the 
streets for as long as there is unrest in 
our lives.’’ 
Speaker PELOSI famously said this on 
the widespread property damage. As 
you saw, when asked about it, she was 
quoted as saying: ‘‘People will do what 
they do.’’ That is a direct quote from

her, and you have seen that many 
times on television. 
Now, that indifference that seems to 
be expressed in those and in a lot of 
other quotations we could give to the 
violence that our constituents were en-
during 
was 
dramatically 
shattered 
when a violent riot came to this build-
ing itself. After that event, many Mem-
bers of Congress asked why a more 
militarized force had not protected 
them from a group of then-President 
Trump supporters who had turned vio-
lent. Police officers were again consid-
ered heroes and protectors unlike last 
summer when they were attacked. The 
presence of National Guard members 
was all of a sudden welcomed rather 
than decried unlike last summer, in 
cities like Portland and Seattle, when 
mayors condemned, maybe, the Presi-
dent or the Federal Government, gen-
erally, for interfering and trying to 
bring peace to those cities. 
Many of the people of this country 
would like to have such resources 
available to them to ensure their safe-
ty, like every weekend in Chicago when 
there are dozens of people hurt by 
shootings and a lot of people killed in 
that same weekend. 
Since the day of the attack on the 
Capitol, I have heard much of a re-
newed focus among my Democratic col-
leagues on combating domestic ter-
rorism and political violence, and there 
is nothing wrong with combating do-
mestic terrorism and political vio-
lence. That is why my first words 
today were that there needs to be equal 
attention to the danger of terrorism, 
whether it is of the left or of the right. 
As I indicated in my words just stated, 
this is very much welcomed—any at-
tention we can give to domestic ter-
rorism and political violence—and I 
hope that we will be able to work to-
gether to keep Americans safe. 
However, any work that we do in this 
area must be focused on preventing vi-
olence no matter what ideology is 
given to justify that violence. In fact, 
in a recent Department of Homeland 
Security bulletin, that bulletin noted 
the breadth of potential threats we 
may be facing after the Capitol riot, in-
cluding domestic violent extremists 
‘‘motivated by a range of issues, in-
cluding anger over COVID–19 restric-
tions, the 2020 election results, and po-
lice use of force’’ as well as ‘‘racial and 
ethnic tension’’ and homegrown violent 
extremists ‘‘inspired by foreign ter-
rorist groups.’’ 
The response that I have seen to the 
Capitol riot here in Congress has not 
given me hope that we are in agree-
ment about combating this broad range 
of threats in the spirit of giving equal 
attention to the dangers of domestic 
terrorism or any kind of violation of 
law, whether it comes from the right or 
the left. I have seen that many Demo-
cratic Members of Congress seem to be 
discussing the need to combat White 
supremacism with reference to the 
Capitol riot. I am not going to find 
fault with anybody who talks about 
any race of any kind thinking they are 
supreme to anybody else because we 
are all individuals that God loves, and 
if we were to return that love, we 
wouldn’t have a lot of problems in this 
country. 
We must absolutely combat White 
supremacism, wherever it occurs, and 
we have a responsibility to understand 
the true factors that led to the attack 
on this building. I hope to learn more 
from law enforcement over the coming 
weeks and months about what the in-
volvement of White supremacists or 
any other extremist was in this attack. 
However, I am concerned that the use 
of the term may have a different pur-
pose: to try to portray any supporters 
of former President Trump, who gar-
nered over 74 million votes in the most 
recent election, as White supremacists. 
Congresswoman CORI BUSH stated on 
the House floor that former President 
Trump was a ‘‘white supremacist presi-
dent who incited a white supremacist 
insurrection.’’ I hope everyone can 
agree that such rhetorical and inac-
curate 
characterizations 
are 
dan-
gerous. 
More concerning seems to be the idea 
that violence committed by the far left 
or for left-leaning ideologies is in some 
way tolerable because of the left’s as-
sessment that the purpose of all that 
violence is somehow noble. However, 
right-leaning thought, whether accom-
panied by violence or not, is considered 
terroristic. 
Former CIA Director John Brennan, 
whose credibility has been questioned, 
praised incoming President Biden’s in-
augural reference to defeating ‘‘white 
supremacy’’ and likened libertarians to 
‘‘religious extremists, authoritarians, 
fascists, bigots, racists, nativists.’’ 
It is hard to see how libertarian po-
litical philosophy, a mainstream con-
servative political ideology which is 
scarcely in any way associated with vi-
olence, is related to the other terms 
that Mr. Brennan lists, unless, of 
course, Mr. Brennan is simply referring 
to religious Americans as religious ex-
tremists, or those who believe in the 
rule of law rather than antifa rioting 
as ‘‘authoritarians’’ and ‘‘fascists,’’ or 
those who believe in having a func-
tioning immigration system as some-
how they seem to be bigots or racists 
or nativists. 
In short, these are all terms that are 
applied regularly and unfairly to con-
servative Americans using peaceful 
means to argue for their ideas of reli-
gious freedom, law and order, and se-
cure borders, and probably a lot of 
other things that they argue for. Con-
gresswoman JACKIE SPEIER was even 
more direct in a tweet, suggesting that 
all Republicans be labeled terrorists. 
As a body, we may begin looking into 
domestic terrorism more generally. I 
look forward to so doing. I am sure all 
Members will share my commitment 
that the focus of our inquiry should be 
on all of the politically motivated vio-
lence we have seen in this country and 
not somehow just a subset of that po-
litically motivated violence. The men 
and women of this Nation who have 
been affected by antifa and other left-
wing extremists are entitled to much 
more than a cursory acknowledgment 
of that fact. Likewise, I hope no part of 
our effort will focus on demonizing the 
peaceful expression of ideas with which 
Democratic Members disagree. 
I will be sharing the ideas that I have 
on this subject and these concerns that 
I have stated today directly with my 
friend, the incoming Senate Judiciary 
chairman, Senator DURBIN. He will get 
a letter from me, and I look forward to 
working with Senator DURBIN on the 
path forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, right-
fully, when we talk about the issue of 
gun violence in this country, we think 
about it through the prism of those 
lives that have been lost because the 
numbers are just stunning. They are 
hard to get your head wrapped around. 
Here are the rough numbers in front 
of me. On an average year, we have 
39,000 people who lose their lives 
through a gunshot wound. That is a 
suicide, a homicide, an accidental 
shooting, domestic violence crimes. If 
you break it down, that is around 100 
people a day, and there is no other 
high-income nation in the world that 
comes anywhere close. 
We talk about the issue of gun vio-
lence through the prism of people 
whose lives have been lost because it is 
so morally disrupting, cataclysmic, 
when you have a loved one—normally, 
a young loved one, a brother or sister, 
a child—who is there one instant and 
then gone the next because of a random 
shooting. 
I always get drawn back to the peo-
ple whom I have been lucky enough to 
have had access to and friendships with 
in Connecticut. One of them is Janet 
Rice. 
Janet lost her son Shane, who was 20 
at the time, to a gunshot wound back 
in 2012. It was actually only a month 
and a half before the Sandy Hook 
shooting. 
Shane was just selling a car to some 
acquaintances, and the conversation 
went off the rails. There was some 
pushing and shoving. There was a gun 
fired, and Shane was dead. 
It is really hard for Janet to describe 
how her life changed. She talks a lot 
about in those early months and years 
really not being able to even leave the 
house. She would drive a couple of 
blocks to the corner grocery store be-
cause she just didn’t want to walk 
down the street and encounter friends 
and have to talk about what happened. 
She had this habit of waking up in 
the middle of the night and driving her 
car down to where Shane was shot, 
which is only about two blocks from 
where I live in Hartford. She would ar-
rive there in the middle of the night, 
she would pull up in the parking lot,

and she would turn on her high beams, 
half expecting that Shane was going to 
show up. 
Her life is fundamentally different 
today than it was when Shane was in 
her life. And I have no idea what it is 
like to lose a child. I have no idea what 
it is like to lose a loved one to gun vio-
lence. But we talk about it in these 
terms because it is absolutely cata-
strophic when you lose somebody that 
way. 
This week, though, is Gun Violence 
Survivors Week. This week we focus on 
those who survived gunshot wounds, 
and I think I hate to tell you this, but 
the numbers are much worse. More 
people survive gunshot wounds than 
are killed by gunshot wounds, and that 
wound can change your life as well. 
It can inflict you with physical pain 
that you can never get over, render you 
unable to walk, and in our colleague 
Gabby Giffords’ case, almost unable to 
speak. But it can also inflict you with 
an ongoing, cascading trauma from 
which you may never recover. 
James Harris was shot in Hartford in 
2018. He was shot while he and another 
friend were just hanging out in the 
hallway of the friend’s apartment 
building, when a man showed up and 
shot James and his friend. The man 
was charged with a whole bunch of 
things, including possession of an ille-
gal firearm. But they were just in the 
wrong place at the wrong time. 
His friend lost his life. James sur-
vived and, to this day, he experiences 
post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic 
pain, and mental health challenges 
that I don’t think anybody in this 
Chamber can get their head wrapped 
around. 
Tyrek Marquez was shot in the head 
a decade earlier, in Hartford, when 
Tyrek was 7 years old, following a West 
Indian Day parade in Hartford in the 
summer of 2008. 
Guess what. The three shooters who 
were arrested were all found to have il-
legal firearms. One of the guns they 
found in the perpetuation of that crime 
had been used in 14 other crimes. 
It is a decade later, and Tyrek re-
mains partially paralyzed on the left 
side of his body. But he is part of the 
anti-gun violence movement. He sur-
vived, and he wants to make sure that 
this never happens to anybody ever 
again. ‘‘You’ve got to overcome obsta-
cles and that’s what I have been’’ able 
to do, he says. 
There are 100 people a day who die 
from guns, but there are just as many 
who survive gunshot wounds, and they 
are now demanding that something 
change. 
Right now, as we debate a COVID re-
lief package, our focus, rightfully, is 
squarely on trying to reverse the dis-
turbing trend of this virus expanding 
all across this country and righting the 
economic ship of this country. But not 
coincidental to the pandemic and the 
economic meltdown, we saw a dramatic 
increase in homicides. Some cities re-
ported 40, 50 percent increases in homi-
cides in 2020 versus 2019. You saw 
record numbers of gun sales. Those two 
things are not coincidental. And those 
are just the reportable gun sales. Like-
ly, we saw a dramatic spike in illegal 
gun transfers as well. More weapons 
equals more gun crimes in this coun-
try. 
And so knowing that 20, 30 percent of 
guns get transferred outside of the 
legal system, knowing that, as in the 
case of Tyrek and James, it was illegal 
guns that ended up being used to shoot 
them, as it was for Shane Oliver in 
Hartford—that mother I talked about, 
Janet Rice; Shane was killed with an 
illegal gun—to honor Gun Violence 
Survivors Week, we have to make a 
plan this year. We have to make a plan 
to work on an issue that can bring us 
all together. 
I hope that Republicans join us in 
voting for COVID relief funding. The 
things in President Biden’s package are 
supported by 70 percent of the Amer-
ican public. That is impressive. It is 
really hard to get the American public 
to agree on anything at a 70-percent 
rate. They have actually done polling 
on things like kittens and baseball and 
grandmas, and it is hard to get 70 per-
cent support for that stuff. So on Joe 
Biden’s agenda, boy, it must be pretty 
popular to get 70 percent of the Amer-
ican public supporting it. 
Universal background checks, requir-
ing that everybody have to prove you 
are not a criminal or seriously men-
tally ill before you buy a gun—that has 
90 to 95 percent support. Think about 
that. That means that the vast major-
ity of gun owners, of NRA members, of 
Republicans, Democrats, Independents, 
all 
support 
universal 
background 
checks. It is something that this body 
can come together on. 
And just like in Tyrek and James’s 
case, every single day we are presented 
with evidence of what happens when we 
let these illegal guns flow on to our 
streets. In Pennsylvania, a man pur-
chased two handguns advertised in a 
classified ad. He used those guns to kill 
a person and wound seven others inside 
a psychiatric institute. He had failed a 
background check at a gun store just a 
few months prior. 
In Illinois, a man killed a Chicago 
police commander with a gun he pur-
chased online. He was prohibited from 
buying a gun because he had a restrain-
ing order. 
Wisconsin, a man killed his wife and 
two other women and wounded four 
others with a gun that he purchased 
outside the background system. Why? 
Because he was prohibited from pur-
chasing a gun because of a domestic vi-
olence restraining order. 
In Texas, a man killed 7 people and 
injured 22 others after being fired from 
his job. He had failed a background 
check but was able to find an unli-
censed seller. 
I can go on. Over and over and over 
again, the victims of gun violence are 
very often put at risk and put in 
harm’s way because there are so many 
guns being sold illegally or so many 
guns being sold legally to people who 
shouldn’t have them, like people with 
serious, violent criminal records and 
people who have been arrested for 
things like domestic violence. 
So, right now, our priority has to be 
COVID relief, but as we take part this 
week in Gun Violence Survivors Week, 
we have to recognize that the status 
quo is not acceptable and that there is 
something fundamentally wrong with 
democracy if a public policy measure 
can enjoy 90 percent support amongst 
the American public, and it can’t get 
passed through the representative bod-
ies that are assembled in the Nation’s 
Capitol. 
Thirty-nine 
thousand 
people 
die 
every year. More are injured and sur-
vive. And we owe them, in 2021, to pass 
legislation that finally starts putting 
these trajectories downward. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss the 
urgent need to get our kids back in 
school. Kids deserve to be back in 
school. 
Last week, the White House Chief of 
Staff was on television. He was inter-
viewed. The interviewer asked him why 
so many public schools remain closed. 
His 
answer—amazingly, 
astonish-
ingly—was ‘‘money.’’ 
If I may, the record is very clear. Re-
publicans supported more money for 
schools since last summer—a full $105 
billion to get our kids back to school. 
In fact, the Senate Republicans’ tar-
geted coronavirus bill included more 
money from schools than Speaker 
PELOSI included in her bloated, liberal 
wish list. 
For months, Senate Democrats ob-
structed, delayed, and dragged their 
feet. For months, Democrats played 
politics with coronavirus relief. In all 
that time, families across America suf-
fered. 
It wasn’t until the end of December 
that Democrats finally agreed to pass 
legislation to reopen the schools, and it 
included $82 billion—less than Repub-
licans had offered the last summer. 
Well, the ink is now barely dry on 
the overall relief bill at the end of last 
year. It was a $900 billion relief bill. So 
here we are, just 1 month later, and the 
new administration says that there is 
no money to reopen schools. 
The White House Chief of Staff goes 
on television with a supposedly new 
idea. The idea is that ‘‘we, as a coun-
try, should make the investments to 
make it safe’’ to get back to school— 
astonishing, because we did that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S235 
February 2, 2021 
If the Biden administration really 
wants their schools to reopen, they 
ought to be talking to the teachers 
unions. They should talk to the leaders 
of the teachers unions based in Fairfax 
County, VA, just a few miles from here. 
You know, it is one of the largest 
school districts in America. Fairfax 
County teachers demanded a vaccine 
before they would go back to the class-
room. 
Thanks 
to 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed, they got the vaccine. Yet they 
still refused to go back to the class-
room, which, of course, means that the 
students aren’t in the classroom either. 
In Chicago, the teachers union is 
threatening to go on strike rather than 
to go back into the classroom, which, 
of course, means the students don’t get 
to back into the classroom either. 
In Washington, DC, the teachers 
union would rather go to court than to 
the classroom, which means that stu-
dents don’t get to go back to the class-
room either. 
Similar stories are taking place all 
across 
America. 
The 
union 
bosses 
might think this is just a big game. 
The truth is, this is doing terrible 
things to our children. 
Our teachers do incredible work. 
Many are working harder than ever in 
the virtual setting. Many want to go 
back to the classroom. Yet, because of 
the union bosses who pull the strings, 
our kids are being denied access to in- 
person learning by our amazing teach-
ers. 
On Wednesday, the New York Times 
said it was ‘‘breaking news’’ that the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention want the kids back in school. 
That is not breaking news. That is old 
news. The CDC said it last July. 
Experts have been echoing this call 
for months. One study estimated that 
because of the lockdown last spring, a 
typical student entered this school 
year 35 percent behind schedule in 
reading and nearly 50 percent behind in 
math. 
The children hurt the most are, of 
course, the most vulnerable—kids from 
lower income families, like the mil-
lions of kids who receive nutrition as-
sistance, medical care, or counseling in 
public schools; also, the children of sin-
gle parents, many of whom—the par-
ents, that is—can’t work from home. 
According to the National Education 
Association, a quarter of the families 
with kids ages 5 to 17 either don’t have 
a computer or don’t have wireless 
internet, so the lockdowns have been 
especially tough on all of those kids in 
those settings. 
For many children, the lockdown has 
been far tougher on their health than 
coronavirus itself would be. That is be-
cause serious coronavirus symptoms 
among healthy children are extremely 
rare. And Congress has provided fund-
ing to prevent kids from spreading the 
coronavirus. It has done it by improv-
ing ventilation, by social distancing, 
and by disinfecting our classrooms. 
So while Democrats were taking 
their orders from teachers unions, Sen-
ate Republicans listened to the science. 
It is time for Senate Democrats to de-
cide: Are they going to put our kids 
first or are they going to continue to 
put the teachers unions ahead of our 
kids? 
Senate Republicans have done our 
part to reopen our schools with incred-
ible amounts of funding and support. 
This is no time for excuses, no time for 
backtracking. The science supports it. 
We have provided the funding. 
Now I would point out that students 
in Wyoming have been back in school 
since September. That is where stu-
dents belong. Kids deserve to be in 
school. So let’s get our kids back in the 
classroom. It is what is best for kids; 
certainly, it is what is best for working 
families; and it is what is best for our 
future as a nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, rela-
tions between the United States and 
Russia are more precarious today than 
at any other time since the Cold War. 
From 
Russian-backed 
mercenaries 
fighting in the Middle East to the 
Kremlin’s attempt to poison Putin’s 
critics like Alexei Navalny using a 
nerve agent, the actions of Russia are 
growing more and more aggressive. 
That is especially true when it comes 
to actions against the United States 
and our allies. 
We know Russia made a clear at-
tempt to interfere with the 2016 elec-
tion and delegitimize our democratic 
processes, like our elections. Through 
everything from highly coordinated 
disinformation campaigns to targeted 
attacks on voting systems, it sought to 
undermine and potentially change the 
result of a democratic election. 
Of course, it is not just our voting 
systems that have come under attack. 
Moscow has launched massive cyber at-
tacks against private companies and 
government agencies alike, the latest 
being the SolarWinds hack. Last year, 
Russia attempted to steal coronavirus 
vaccine 
research 
from 
the 
United 
States and our closest allies. 
The Biden administration has re-
sponded to these mounting threats in 
an unlikely way—by giving Russia ex-
actly what it wants. Sure, I know there 
were some press reports about a con-
versation between President Biden and 
President Putin, but then again, that is 
all it was—words, not action. 
This Friday is the expiration date for 
the New START treaty—the only re-
maining bilateral strategic nuclear 
agreement between the United States 
and Russia. Since New START entered 
force a decade ago, there has been no 
lack of criticism about its short-
comings. For example, here on the Sen-
ate floor last week, I outlined some of 
the main issues with New START, in-
cluding the fact that it only placed 
limits on strategic nuclear weapons, 
leaving room open for an endless arse-
nal of tactical nuclear weapons, which 
were particularly of interest to Russia 
in a potential land war in Europe. The 
new 
Senator 
from 
Tennessee 
and 
former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, BILL 
HAGERTY, has echoed that concern as 
well. 
But it is not just Republicans who 
acknowledge the need for a new ap-
proach. Victoria Nuland is an experi-
enced and accomplished diplomat with 
more than three decades of experience, 
and she has been nominated by Presi-
dent Biden for a high-ranking position 
in the State Department. In an opinion 
piece she wrote last year, she wrote 
that the United States ‘‘should not 
grant Moscow what it wants most: a 
free rollover of New START without 
any negotiations to address Russia’s 
recent investments in short- and me-
dium-range nuclear weapons systems 
and new conventional weapons.’’ In 
other words, Russia is building new 
weapons that will not be included in 
the New START negotiations, but they 
should be. 
The President didn’t take the advice 
of Ambassador Nuland, obviously. He 
didn’t advocate for new limits on tac-
tical weapons or these new weapons 
systems or impose any other condi-
tions to combat Russian aggression. In 
a call with President Putin last week, 
President Biden agreed to a clean 5- 
year extension—no conditions, no ne-
gotiations; in short, a capitulation. He 
gave him a green light to keep doing 
what they have been doing. 
Well, it didn’t take long for Russian 
leaders to celebrate this win. The Dep-
uty Foreign Minister of Russia de-
clared that the United States had 
agreed to extend the treaty on Russia’s 
terms, and both houses of Russia’s Par-
liament unanimously voted in favor of 
the ratification of the extension within 
hours of the announcement. In other 
words, the Biden administration is on 
exactly the same page as the Duma. 
That ought to give them some pause. It 
is fair to say there has been no celebra-
tion here in the United States, but the 
truth is, there has hardly been any at-
tention paid to this issue at all, includ-
ing here in Congress. 
The administration has 
tried 
to 
maintain its focus on the President’s 
long list of executive actions. In his 
first 2 weeks in office, President Biden 
has used the power of the pen to cancel 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, rejoin the 
Paris Climate Agreement, stop drilling 
on Federal lands and in Federal waters, 
and so much more. Why did the Presi-
dent focus on this agenda? Well, be-
cause he has called climate change— 
not nuclear weapons—the existential 
threat of our time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S236 
February 2, 2021 
Don’t get me wrong—I think our 
country can and should do more to re-
duce emissions and preserve our land 
and waters for future generations, but 
those measures shouldn’t come at the 
cost of thousands of jobs, reduced en-
ergy independence, and higher prices 
for consumers, including seniors on 
fixed incomes. 
I have always been a proponent of the 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy strategy, 
which relies on fossil fuels and renew-
ables, as well as innovative tech-
nologies to provide our country with 
reliable, affordable, and lower emis-
sions energy sources. In fact, just 
about a month ago, I introduced a bill 
to help spur that innovation, which 
was signed into law. But based on the 
emphasis of the Biden administration 
on climate change and the near silence 
we are hearing on nuclear treaties, you 
would think that climate change is a 
bigger threat to the world than a nu-
clear war. Only in a fevered imaginary 
world could that be true. 
Our Democratic colleagues in the 
Senate and many members of the 
media played along as well, praising 
the President’s efforts to combat one 
self-proclaimed crisis while ignoring 
its failure to address a clear and 
present danger and a threat to the 
planet. 
The 
fact 
is, 
the 
administration 
missed a huge opportunity by extend-
ing the New START treaty without 
any other conditions, and it has to do 
with much more than just the threats 
posed by Russia. While the United 
States and Russia are the two biggest 
nuclear powers in the world, we are not 
the only ones. There are five non-
proliferation treaty states, two of 
which are Russia and the United 
States. But there is also the UK and 
France, both of which provide regular 
information about the size and makeup 
of their nuclear arsenals. 
The fifth and final power is China, a 
police state and one of the world’s 
greatest 
secret 
keepers, 
especially 
when it comes to its nuclear arsenal. 
China, we think, has quietly been 
growing its nuclear arsenal for years, 
and the thick cloak of secrecy sur-
rounding 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party has made it nearly impossible to 
verify information about the breadth 
and depth of its nuclear capabilities. 
But from the information we have, we 
know China continues to pursue a nu-
clear triad, and experts estimate China 
to have about 300 nuclear weapons. As-
suming that figure is correct, it makes 
China the third most powerful nuclear 
country in the world, behind the 
United States and Russia, and we have 
every reason to believe that the size of 
its arsenal will continue to grow. 
In May of 2019, then-Director of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, Robert 
Ashley, said China is likely to at least 
double the size of its nuclear stockpile 
over the next decade. He referred to 
this effort as ‘‘the most rapid expan-
sion and diversification of its nuclear 
arsenal in China’s history.’’ 
Here we are, a year and a half after 
that estimate, and there is no reason 
to believe that China has changed its 
course. In fact, it appears the an-
nouncement of a New START exten-
sion received a warm welcome in Bei-
jing, just as it did in Moscow. The 
story that ran this weekend in the 
South China Morning Post said this ex-
tension ‘‘means the gap between China 
and the two nuclear giants. . . . will 
not widen and Beijing could spend the 
next five years catching up.’’ There 
you have it. That is the real takeaway 
of a clean extension of New START. 
The Biden administration has agreed 
to leave in place a framework in which 
the Russians continue to cheat, the 
Chinese play catch up, and the United 
States is left to play by the rules of a 
bygone era. 
Rather than enter into a 5-year ex-
tension of New START, the adminis-
tration should have used its leverage to 
convene multilateral nuclear talks. 
America should invite the other non-
proliferation 
states—Russia, 
China, 
France, and the UK—to the negotiating 
table and encourage multilateral talks 
limiting the growth of nuclear arsenals 
worldwide. 
I understand President Biden’s desire 
to focus on the issues he campaigned 
on—whether it is climate change, im-
migration reform, or any other policy 
area—but in doing so, he should not ig-
nore the larger threats to global secu-
rity or relinquish the leverage we have 
to secure a deal that improves global 
security at large. 
Nuclear 
weapons, 
not 
climate 
change, are the greatest existential 
threat we face, and the United States 
cannot sit idly by while Moscow and 
Beijing pass us by. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
the way forward for this new Congress 
and the new Biden administration. 
Specifically, this afternoon, we are 
talking about the budget resolution 
that the Democratic side has proposed. 
There was a vote today to begin to pro-
ceed on that. My understanding is that 
by the end of this week, we will have a 
number of amendments about the 
budget, and this all goes toward a proc-
ess called reconciliation. If the two 
budgets are agreed upon, that would 
enable us—with 50 votes rather than 
the normal 60 votes—to take on a real-
ly important issue, which is the issue 
of how we should address the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
But, to me, this is an even bigger 
question. It is a question about how we 
are going to proceed, as a Congress, 
working with this new administration. 
If you recall, the Senate is now a 50–50 
split. That is as closely divided as you 
can possibly be. There are 50 Senators 
on this side and 50 Senators on that 
side. The House is more closely divided 
than it has been in years. And, signifi-
cantly, the American people are more 
divided than they have been in years. 
I think the American people, as a 
general matter—not everybody, but I 
think the American people are looking 
for us to deal with these divisions here 
in the country by working together to 
try to get something done, by working 
together to help heal the wounds that 
are out there. 
As for me, one Senator, I am very in-
terested in helping President Biden 
make good on the pledge that he made 
on the steps of the Capitol. On the west 
steps, just that way in the U.S. Capitol, 
on Inauguration Day, January 20, the 
President said that he wanted to bring 
our country together. He wanted to 
help heal those wounds. He wanted us 
to work across the aisle. He wanted to 
go back to an era here where we actu-
ally sat down, debated things, worked 
them out together, and, therefore, 
helped bring our country together. 
I hope, with regard to the COVID–19 
discussions, 
that 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats will agree to keep working 
on charting the Federal response to the 
ongoing healthcare and economic crisis 
in a bipartisan way. It is the one area 
where we have done it. 
Yet when you think of all the divi-
sion in all of the times when we 
haven’t been able to find agreement on 
things around here, one place we have 
been able to find agreement has been 
with regard to COVID–19. Specifically, 
we have passed five different bills—five 
bills—with big majorities, bipartisan 
majorities. One was actually by unani-
mous consent. 
The most recent one was just 5 weeks 
ago or less, at the end of the year, 
when Congress passed a $900 billion 
COVID-relief package in an entirely bi-
partisan way. And $900 billion, by the 
way, makes that the second most ex-
pensive legislative package that Con-
gress has ever passed—$900 billion. The 
first one was the CARES Act, which 
also related to the coronavirus pan-
demic that we are in. Over $4 trillion— 
that is trillion with a ‘‘t’’—has been 
spent on this, larger than our typical 
annual budget for everything in gov-
ernment. And do you know what? It is 
a crisis, and we needed to step up to 
the plate. 
But now, while the ink is still drying 
on the bill that we passed at the end of 
the year, the Biden administration has 
proposed another $1.9 trillion to deal 
with the coronavirus pandemic. 
My own view is that, again, this is an 
area where we have been able to come 
together. Let’s do it again. 
Is there more need out there? Well, 
when Congress passed the $900 billion 
legislation, we all said: This is a bridge 
to get us to between now and when the 
vaccines are readily available, which

we all hope happens sooner rather than 
later. 
But there may be some things we 
need to do in the interim—I think 
there are—and maybe some things 
after the March, April time period that 
we hadn’t thought about for the vac-
cine availability. The vaccines are 
moving out more slowly than expected. 
So I, for one, am willing to sit down 
with Republicans and Democrats alike, 
as we have done, again, five different 
times, to work on how we can come to-
gether to provide that bridge to a bet-
ter time when the economy will im-
prove because the COVID–19 issue will 
have been addressed. 
My concern is that, again, today, we 
started down a track, by starting on 
the budget, to end up with budget rec-
onciliation, which would mean a 50- 
vote rather than a 60-vote margin be-
cause the other side of the aisle— 
Democrats—think it would be better 
not to try to work out something on a 
bipartisan basis but to simply use their 
majority to get something through 
here that they would like to do that is 
consistent 
with 
where 
President 
Biden’s $1.9 trillion package is. 
We will see. Maybe they could be suc-
cessful at that, maybe not, because it 
would require every Member on that 
side of the aisle to agree with the $1.9 
trillion package, which is a comprehen-
sive, complicated package, which in-
cludes a number of things addressed to 
COVID–19 
but 
another 
number 
of 
things that are unrelated to COVID–19, 
some of which are popular on the other 
side of the aisle in particular, like 
changes in tax law that have nothing 
to do with COVID–19, changes to the 
Federal minimum wage that have 
nothing to do with COVID–19. But we 
will see. 
But even if they could pass it by the 
barest majority, given that it is a 50–50 
Senate, it is not the right way to go for 
our country. I don’t think anybody 
truly believes it is the best thing for 
our country. 
Again, if we can’t come together as 
Republicans and Democrats, as we have 
proven that we can time and again over 
the last year, what can we come to-
gether on? And wouldn’t that poison 
the well? Wouldn’t it make it harder 
for us, then, to find that common 
ground on things like infrastructure 
investments, on things like retirement 
security? I think it is going to be hard-
er if we start off on the wrong foot, if 
we start off in a purely partisan way. 
I was part of the group of five Demo-
crats and five Republicans who sat 
down—we call ourselves the 908 Coali-
tion because we put together a bipar-
tisan framework, actual legislation, on 
COVID–19. This was over the last few 
months before Christmas. Then, at the 
end of the year, Congress passed the 
$900 billion bill. Our framework pro-
vided a basis for that. It wasn’t exactly 
the same, but it provided a basis for 
that. 
Frankly, because Republicans and 
Democrats alike—five and five—were 
able to agree, it helped get our leader-
ship more focused on how to find a bi-
partisan result, as we had done pre-
viously, because things weren’t going 
very well. They weren’t talking to each 
other. 
They 
weren’t 
making 
the 
progress that we had hoped. That group 
has shown that we can, indeed, come 
together and make tough choices. Not 
one thing in that legislative effort was 
not bipartisan. 
By the way, there were five of us on 
the Republican side, five on the Demo-
cratic side. None of us agreed with all 
of it. It was a matter of compromise— 
a word that maybe isn’t too popular 
anymore, but that is how you get 
things done around here. You have to 
figure out: What is that common 
ground? What is the way in which you 
can make progress without having ev-
erything your way? 
We have shown we can do it. The 908 
Coalition is ready to go again. 
I will say that what we were able to 
do with that coalition was to help 
move the process forward in a bipar-
tisan way. And, in the end, we got $69 
billion in funding for vaccine develop-
ment and distribution, $82 billion to 
support our students in school, $325 bil-
lion to restart the highly successful 
small business program called the Pay-
check Protection Program. 
At 
unprecedented 
deficit 
times, 
where we want to be sure every dollar 
is wisely spent, that $900 billion was 
about one-seventh of the size of the 
Democratic proposal that was origi-
nally out there and was supported by a 
lot of Democrats here in the Senate— 
not one Republican, by the way. That 
was a $3.5 trillion bill called the Heroes 
Act. We ended up doing something that 
was smaller but more targeted and 
more effective in dealing with the im-
mediate problems with no extraneous 
provisions that had nothing to do with 
COVID–19, which was the case of the 
Heroes Act. 
So we have done it time and time 
again—five different times. Let’s do it 
again. 
If we are going to continue respond-
ing to this crisis in a smart way that 
meets the needs of our constituents, it 
is going to require us having that kind 
of a good-faith, bipartisan negotiation. 
Again, 
in 
his 
inaugural 
address, 
President Biden said: ‘‘This is our his-
toric moment of crisis and challenge, 
and unity is the path forward.’’ 
I don’t think he meant just unity 
with one party or another. Clearly, the 
context of that speech and his other 
comments were about outreach to Re-
publicans and Democrats alike to get 
back to an era where we worked to-
gether. 
Unfortunately, since that address, 
the President’s team and his party ap-
pear to have chosen a different path, 
introducing this new COVID–19 pack-
age I talked about without any input, 
any consultation with any Republican 
or, for that matter, I think it is fair to 
say, any Democrat in this Chamber. I 
may be wrong. But I know the Demo-
crats who are on the 908 Coalition were 
not consulted, period. 
That is not the way forward. Why 
would we do that? Why wouldn’t we, 
once again, do what we have proven we 
can do, particularly following what I 
thought was an excellent speech, talk-
ing about how we can work together. 
The $1.9 trillion package that was 
sent up does have extraneous matters 
that have nothing to do with COVID– 
19, as the Heroes Act did. I understand 
that these are popular proposals, par-
ticularly on the Democratic side. We 
can debate those, and we can have a 
vote on those, but let’s do it outside of 
the COVID–19 context. 
We should have a debate about min-
imum wage. We should have a debate 
on changing the child tax credit, the 
earned-income tax credit, which would 
not affect COVID–19 at all because no 
one believes that a year from now that 
we are going to be in this position, 
which is when people could take advan-
tage of those tax credits. But they are 
in the legislation, as an example. 
There are provisions in there for 
clean energy. That is a good debate for 
us to have but not in the context of 
this. There are provisions in there for 
cyber security—$10 billion for improv-
ing our cyber security in the Federal 
Government. The Presiding Officer and 
I actually like that idea, to have cyber 
security funds and to set up a new way 
to push back against these terrible 
cyber attacks that we have had, par-
ticularly recently—a massive one. But 
that is not appropriate for the COVID– 
19 bill. As much as I would like to have 
that debate, let’s do it separately. By 
the way, that can be bipartisan as well. 
The $1.9 trillion proposal also has a 
new round of stimulus checks that are 
written so that a family with three 
kids making $290,000 a year can end up 
getting a check from the Federal Gov-
ernment, even if they have had no neg-
ative impact from COVID–19. That 
seems, to us, to be wrongheaded. And, I 
think, frankly, a lot of Democrats 
agree to that, too, and believe it ought 
to be more targeted toward those who 
need it the most. 
The economic analysis in this is 
clear, which is that these higher in-
come individuals who have received 
earlier stimulus checks have ended up 
not spending them, meaning they don’t 
stimulate the economy, which is the 
whole idea of the stimulus checks. 
There is some recent data out by an 
economist named Chetty, who is well 
respected, that says, of the $1,400 that 
the proposal that the President has 
laid out going to these families—of 
that $1,400, if someone makes over 
$78,000 a year, likely they only spend 
about $105 of that money. The rest they 
will save, put in the stock market, do 
something else with it but not spend. 
So let’s target it. We are not against 
stimulus checks, but we are against 
sending stimulus checks to people who 
are wealthy, who don’t need it. That 
seems like not an effective use of tax-
payer dollars at a time of these unprec-
edented deficits and debts, with our

debt being the highest it has been, as a 
percent of our economy, since World 
War II. 
We also have to realize that the $900 
billion that was in the package that 
just passed 5 weeks ago or less has not 
been fully spent. In fact, most analyses 
show that less than half of that $900 
billion has gone out the door. So we 
can’t know what the impact has been 
of what we just spent—again, the sec-
ond largest expenditure of funds ever in 
the history of this Congress because 
half of it has not even got out the door, 
or more. Let’s do an analysis there. 
Apparently, without taking the time 
to see if there are 60 Senators willing 
to move forward with this new idea of 
a new bipartisan package, this rec-
onciliation approach I talked about 
earlier is the one that Democrats seem 
to want to take. It is a rare process. 
You have to have a budget passed by 
both sides. It only happens every few 
years. The reconciliation is in the un-
derlying budget we are voting on over 
the next couple of days here. It is 
something that can be used—reconcili-
ation—only for budget-related issues, 
only for mandatory spending and for 
revenue, for taxes, and for reducing the 
debt. So it has to be budget related. 
Actually, some of the things in the 
$1.9 trillion dollar package can’t even 
be done by reconciliation, which would 
mean we would have to be changing the 
rules of this body in order to include 
them in reconciliation. That is another 
bad idea. First bad idea, not to work on 
a bipartisan basis. At least try. At 
least try. The second one is, using rec-
onciliation, which is a mere 50-vote 
margin for something that is not di-
rectly related to the budget that has a 
direct impact. It can’t be merely inci-
dental to the budget, as an example. 
There are a number of provisions in 
there that fit that category. And there 
is at least discussion, I am told—and 
we have heard it openly from my col-
leagues on the other side of saying: 
Well, we are just going to overrule the 
Chair—essentially nuke—going the nu-
clear option, as they say. The nuclear 
option means that you overrule the 
Chair—and by a mere 50 votes, change 
the rules of the Senate. 
Please don’t do that. That would be, 
again, setting us down a path of par-
tisanship we don’t need to do. It would 
be poisoning the well. It would be say-
ing—just as getting rid of the filibuster 
would—we are going to change the 
rules now that we are in charge. 
The rules are there for a reason. And 
that is to ensure that, to the extent 
possible, the Senate is a body where 
you find at least some modicum of bi-
partisanship to move forward because 
you have to get those 60 votes, not just 
50 votes or 51. 
By trying to jam through this $1.9 
trillion legislation, it sets exactly the 
wrong tone for the country and also for 
the administration. I think President 
Biden has a real opportunity to help 
heal our country—I really do. By the 
way, I think he sincerely wants to. 
That is why I don’t understand this 
process. 
Our 908 Coalition—this bipartisan 
group, which is now 20 Members, 10 Re-
publicans and 10 Democrats—and we 
took it up to 10 Republicans because we 
wanted to show that you can get to 60 
votes. If you had 50 Democrats, you 
would have 10 Republicans willing to 
work with them. And I am sure there 
are many, many more than those 10. I 
know there are. This group is now 
being tested. 
This group was bipartisan under 
President Trump. I hope it will be bi-
partisan under President Biden. I hope 
that that bipartisanship shows up 
quickly before we go down this path. 
We had a meeting last week of our 
908 Coalition, and our Democratic col-
leagues asked us: What can we support? 
If it is not $1.9 trillion, what is it? Fair 
question. Again, many of us think we 
ought to find out what happened to the 
$900 
billion 
first, 
hard-earned 
tax 
money that hasn’t been spent yet. But 
we said: OK. We will put together a 
proposal that we could support—not 
that we support all elements of it but 
we could support in order to respond to 
the President’s $1.9 trillion package in 
addressing all of the major issues that 
he addressed. 
Over the weekend, we outlined a $600 
billion package that does just that. It 
addresses the most urgent needs of our 
country. It does not include any of the 
unrelated provisions in the Democrats’ 
package that have nothing to do with 
COVID–19. What it does contain is the 
same $160 billion that is in the $1.9 tril-
lion 
package 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
healthcare. 
What does that mean? It means that 
if we are going to get out of this crisis 
we find ourselves in, we have to address 
the COVID–19 issue, right? We are not 
just going to have an economy improve 
immediately to the extent we would 
like to see it without dealing with the 
healthcare crisis. That is what is driv-
ing the fact that restaurants are closed 
down, the fact that people are losing 
jobs through no fault of their own, the 
fact that we have these economic 
issues related to COVID. So the sen-
sible thing to do is to be sure we are 
dealing with the vaccine, development 
and distribution, dealing with testing, 
dealing with tracing, making sure we 
have proper PPE. All of that is in the 
$160 billion that is in the Biden pro-
posal. It is also in the proposal that we 
Republicans on the Coalition put for-
ward—$160 billion, the same. 
For those issues, we are consistent 
with President Biden’s plan on addi-
tional healthcare support. Our proposal 
also prioritizes getting kids back to 
the classroom, which we think is really 
important. Specifically, we have $20 
billion toward getting children safely 
back into classrooms, which is on top 
of the $82 billion we just spent on 
schools at the end of year. As a parent, 
I couldn’t feel more strongly about 
this; we need to get our children back 
to school, and we need to make sure we 
it is safe—and we can do both. 
We also provide an additional $12 bil-
lion for nutrition programs to combat 
food insecurity and ensure that fami-
lies, kids have food on the table. This 
is consistent, again, with the Biden ad-
ministration plan. These are ones that 
we agree on. 
Our proposal also includes $20 billion 
for the childcare and development 
block grants so our childcare facilities 
across the country can stay open, so 
the parents can go back to work. 
Childcare 
is 
incredibly 
expensive. 
Again, this is where we agree. 
We have a new round of $50 billion in 
financial support for small businesses, 
but we use it in a program we know 
works rather than setting up a new 
program, which would take a long time 
to put in place. 
We help the hardest hit families and 
individuals through expanding unem-
ployment insurance for those who lose 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own. We expand it from where it cur-
rently ends now, in mid-March, to the 
end of June, so June 30. 
We extend it at $300 per week, which 
is the Federal supplement now in place. 
There, the Biden administration wants 
$400 rather than $300 and wants to ex-
tend it into September, to September 
30. There is no economic data that says 
that that will be necessary. If it is, we 
can take it up again. So there we have 
a proposal that is similar but more tar-
geted to meet the real needs of our 
economy. 
Our proposal also provides direct 
stimulus checks to Americans who 
really need that extra amount of 
money to pay their rent or put food on 
the table or pay their mortgage. By the 
way, we do it by lowering these limits. 
Instead of going to families that make 
300,000 bucks a year or more—if they 
have got three or four kids, we say let’s 
cap it at $50,000 for individuals, $100,000 
for families, an additional $500 per 
child. 
Again, all the economists say that is 
what makes sense because those are 
the folks who are really going to spend 
it and need it. Let’s target this to 
those who really need the help. 
We accomplish all these things at 
one-third of the cost of the Biden pro-
posal. Much of the difference between 
our proposal and the Biden administra-
tion’s is we don’t include the extra-
neous matters, but also it is how we ad-
dress these two crises: the healthcare 
crisis to defeat the underlying disease 
and the work we are trying to do to en-
sure the economy can recover. Both 
proposals rightly provide the resources 
needed to address the healthcare crisis, 
as I said. 
But with regard to the economic cri-
sis, we take a little different approach. 
Our focus is on getting targeted aid to 
those who need it the most. In con-
trast, a large portion of the adminis-
tration’s $1.9 trillion package is about 
spending taxpayer dollars to stimulate 
the economy that, based on all the 
data, is already beginning to recover. 
And that is something that, frankly, is 
not an effective use of taxpayer dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S239 
February 2, 2021 
Just yesterday, the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, or CBO, re-
ported that the economy is growing 
quite well right now. They project a 
3.7-percent real economic growth in 
this year we are in, in 2021. That is sig-
nificant economic growth. That takes 
into account inflation, real economic 
growth at 3.7 percent. That just came 
out yesterday. 
By the way, the Wall Street Journal 
does a survey of a bunch of econo-
mists—60 economists—and their con-
sensus for the economic growth in this 
year is not 3.7 percent, it is 4.3 percent. 
Even better. So the economy is pro-
jected to grow quite well this year. 
Importantly, the CBO also said that 
the economy is expected to recover to 
prepandemic levels by the middle of 
the year. They say that by June 30, the 
economy will be back to where it was 
before the pandemic, which was a very 
strong economy. In fact, a year ago 
February, this month, we had 19 
straight months of wage growth of over 
3 percent. We had the lowest poverty 
rate in the history of our country. 
There was a lot of good things going on 
in our economy. And they say we are 
going to get back to that—this is CBO, 
not me—by the middle of this year. 
Meanwhile, after record-high jobless 
claims we saw last spring when unem-
ployment hit 14.7 percent, the national 
unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 
percent, which means Americans are 
able to find work, for the most part. Is 
it where I would like it to be? No. But 
the CBO says the unemployment num-
bers are going to go down, as does ev-
erybody else who has projected this 
over the next year. They say it is going 
to drop this year to 5.3 percent. Five 
percent used to be considered full em-
ployment. We would like to see it even 
better than that. But the point is, the 
economy is improving. And as we get 
these virus pandemic issues under con-
trol, the economy will improve even 
more. Having the vaccines readily 
available is going to make a big dif-
ference. And, of course, again, that is 
why we put so much money into that 
in our proposal. 
CBO is basing these projections, by 
the way, without factoring any of the 
new $1.9 trillion. They don’t assume 
that there will be any more stimulus 
than what we just passed several weeks 
ago. In other words, while the Biden 
Administration says we need $1.9 tril-
lion in new spending or our economy 
will tank, CBO says very clearly that is 
not true. 
Instead, we need to help those who 
are still struggling and cannot find a 
job because their industry shuttered or 
their business isn’t allowed to reopen, 
and that is what our targeted proposal 
will do. 
Other respected sources agree with 
CBO’s optimism. I mentioned these 68 
economists indicating 4.3 percent eco-
nomic growth. The Committee for a 
Responsible Federal Budget said yes-
terday that the CBO data underscores 
the need for a targeted package, say-
ing: ‘‘It shouldn’t take $1.9 trillion to 
fill a $400 billion or $800 billion hole’’ in 
our economy. 
We have more data to suggest that 
the economy is on a path to recovery. 
For example, we know that household 
incomes rose slightly—but they rose— 
in December. This was the first in-
crease in 3 months. The personal sav-
ings rate in December rose signifi-
cantly—13.7 percent—indicating there 
is a lot of pent-up demand right there 
for people to get out and start spending 
money again. 
To me, all this points to a pretty 
clear conclusion that in the immediate 
aftermath of the $900 billion bipartisan 
package just passed at year end, there 
is simply not a strong argument to 
spend an additional $1.9 trillion on 
stimulus. Instead, we need to use this 
next COVID–19 package to focus on the 
ongoing healthcare challenges of the 
pandemic—that is the key thing—and 
on getting targeted economic relief to 
the hardest hit Americans, which is 
what our $600 billion proposal does. 
I appreciate that, in the last few 
days, President Biden has expressed 
more willingness to work with bipar-
tisan Members of Congress on this crit-
ical challenge. After we wrote to Presi-
dent Biden on Sunday requesting a 
meeting 
to 
discuss 
our 
targeted 
COVID–19 relief proposal, he quickly 
accepted, and, yesterday, we had a 
lengthy and, I thought, very productive 
discussion at the White House. While 
we didn’t come to an agreement on a 
proposal—and as you can see today on 
the floor, Democrats are moving for-
ward with this budget process, regard-
less—it was a productive discussion 
and gives me hope that we can follow 
the bipartisan approach we have taken 
from the previous five COVID bills. The 
meeting reaffirmed that there is a lot 
of common ground for us to build an-
other bill upon and that we share the 
belief that we need to ensure the hard-
est hit individuals and families and 
small businesses get more support they 
need during this crisis. 
My hope is that we can use these two 
proposals as a starting point for nego-
tiations on a COVID–19 response pack-
age that Congress can pass, as we have 
before, consistently, with bipartisan 
support, not through partisan par-
liamentary maneuvers. 
This pandemic gives us an oppor-
tunity to come together as Republicans 
and Democrats and show the American 
people we can put aside the partisan-
ship and the divisions that have be-
come the norm around here and get 
things done. 
If we can’t do it on COVID–19, as we 
have five times already, where can we 
do it? 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle and with President Biden to fol-
low his desire to make good on his 
pledge in the inaugural address to work 
together to respond to this crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to compliment my good friend 
and colleague Senator PORTMAN, the 
great Senator from the State of Ohio, 
who has done so much in this Chamber 
on so many issues—COVID–19 relief is 
just one—to help our great Nation. 
Some of you may have heard the 
news that Senator PORTMAN—I am still 
very 
distraught 
about 
it—has 
an-
nounced that he is not going to be run-
ning for reelection in 2 years, and I 
think that is going to be a huge loss, 
not just to the State of Ohio but to our 
great Nation. 
I want to commend Senator PORTMAN 
for all his phenomenal work. He is 
proving, again, his leadership and his 
statesmanship here as we are trying to 
attack and take on big challenges for 
our Nation. 
CHINA 
Mr. President, I also want to talk 
about another big challenge for our Na-
tion, something that I have come down 
on the floor since I was elected 6 years 
ago to the Senate to talk about, and 
that is the challenge that we have with 
regard to the rise of China. As a matter 
of fact, this is an area I talk frequently 
about because there is a lot more bi-
partisan progress on this incredibly im-
portant 
issue—the 
most 
important 
geostrategic challenge facing our Na-
tion right now, probably the challenge 
that will be facing us for the next 50 to 
100 years—that is with us today. 
But there has been progress. I want 
to talk about this progress, and I want 
to talk about something, another de-
velopment that I think is very impor-
tant. 
There has been an awakening. When I 
started to come down and talk about 
the rise of China, not a lot of people 
were talking about it, but there has 
been huge progress in that now every-
body is talking about it—the Biden ad-
ministration, and the Trump adminis-
tration had been. I think President 
Trump and his team, with their na-
tional security strategy, their national 
defense strategy, deserve a lot of credit 
from reorienting our focus, which was 
the appropriate focus post-9/11 on vio-
lent extremist organizations, like al- 
Qaida and ISIS, to the new challenge of 
great power competition with China as 
the pacing threat that we have with re-
gard to our Nation. 
Again, this is something that has 
been very bipartisan. When you look at 
Members of this body, particularly 
those who focus on foreign policy and 
national security, they all agree that 
this reorientation on this challenge is 
something that we need to be doing as 
a country in a bipartisan way—dealing 
with the rise of China. 
I think, when we talk about this 
challenge, we are at a place in history 
that, in many ways, is analogous to the 
period right after World War II. I want 
to talk briefly about that in my re-
marks. 
In 1946, we had what at the time was 
a recognition that, post World War II, 
we had a new challenge—similar to the

S240 
February 2, 2021 
challenge we are seeing right now, the 
recognition that we have this challenge 
with China. In 1946, we started to rec-
ognize that we have a challenge with 
our old World War II ally, the Soviet 
Union. There was a big focus on this 
challenge, but not necessarily in orga-
nizing foreign policy principles that 
could help us get through it. 
Then, in the 1946–1947 period, an 
American diplomat named George Ken-
nan wrote an article. It was an anony-
mous article—he signed it the ‘‘X Arti-
cle’’—in Foreign Affairs, and it was 
called ‘‘The Sources of Soviet Con-
duct.’’ What Kennan did, really, for the 
country, for elected officials, for the 
Senate, for the executive branch, is 
that he laid out what he saw as the 
challenge that we are facing with re-
gard to the Soviet Union—the internal 
weaknesses that the Soviets actually 
had—with incredible insights in that 
regard, and, then, what our long-term 
strategy should be. 
Here is what he said in this article. 
He said that American policymakers 
need to enact a policy of ‘‘firm contain-
ment’’ with regard to the Soviet Union, 
a country that always was trying to ex-
pand. He said, if we, as a nation, with 
our allies, try to contain this expan-
sion, it would ‘‘increase enormously 
the strains under which the Soviet 
[Union and its] policy must operate 
. . . and in this way promote ten-
dencies which must eventually find 
their outlet in either the breakup or 
the 
gradual 
mellowing 
of 
Soviet 
power.’’ 
Think about that. That was the 
strategy of containment laid out by 
George Kennan, followed for decades by 
American 
administrations, 
by 
this 
body, Republicans and Democrats—the 
strategy of containment. And we all 
know what happened. 
George Kennan’s fundamental in-
sights into this policy—that the Soviet 
Union would either mellow or com-
pletely break down and collapse be-
cause we were putting containment 
pressure on them—ended up happening. 
The Berlin Wall came down just as 
Kennan predicted. The Soviet Union 
broke up peacefully, and this was a re-
markable triumph of American democ-
racy and strategy that our Nation 
should be proud of. That is what hap-
pened then. 
A lot of us have been saying that we 
are at a new point with regard to 
China. There is an awakening. What 
should that strategy be? I want to talk 
about a strategy document that just 
came out. 
Kennan’s document was called the 
‘‘Long Telegram.’’ Just this past week-
end, the Atlantic Council—which is a 
think tank here in DC and has been 
around for decades and is very well re-
spected on the Republican side and the 
Democrat side—put out a strategy that 
they called the ‘‘Longer Telegram,’’ 
literally in kind of the analogous situa-
tion that George Kennan had done this 
in 1946 and 1947. 
This strategy, also, coincidentally, 
does not identify the author. So it is 
similar to that ‘‘X Article’’ in 1946 and 
1947. The author is anonymous and put 
out a strategy with insights on how we, 
as a nation, should deal with the rise of 
China. The Atlantic Council, as I said, 
has been around for decades. They pub-
lished this, and they said this is prob-
ably the most impressive strategy doc-
ument that they have ever published. 
Now, is it perfect? Is this the answer? 
Is this the containment strategy from 
1946 and 1947 that was the triumph of 
American diplomacy over the last 50 
years with the Soviet Union? 
We shall see. We don’t know. But I 
looked through it, and I do think it is 
quite a remarkable document, and it is 
a great important development that we 
all need to come together on and this 
new administration—the Biden admin-
istration—needs to take a hard look at. 
The focus of this strategy document 
says, which we all believe now, that 
‘‘the single most important challenge 
facing the United States in the twenty- 
first century is the rise of an increas-
ingly authoritarian China under Presi-
dent General Secretary Xi Jinping.’’ 
I think a lot of us know that. A lot of 
us have been talking about that. That 
is the awakening that I believe has 
happened here in the United States and 
certainly here in the U.S. Senate. 
But like the Kennan article, this one 
has some very perceptive insights. One 
is that it focuses on what it sees as one 
of the biggest weaknesses in China 
right now, and that is the fracturing of 
the Communist Party leadership. I am 
going to talk about that because it em-
phasizes—‘‘anonymous’’ here empha-
sizes—that should be our focus. 
The piece begins by setting the stage 
of where we are right now. 
The strategy article published by the 
Atlantic Council is titled ‘‘The Longer 
Telegram: Toward a New American 
China Strategy’’ and can be found at 
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/con-
tent-series/atlantic-council-strategy- 
paper-series/the-longer-telegram/. 
It talks about the scale of the econ-
omy of China and its military and the 
speed of its technical advancement and 
its radically different world view than 
that of the United States. It notes that 
China now profoundly impacts every 
major U.S. national interest. This is 
our challenge, one that is gradually 
emerged over two decades and has ac-
celerated greatly under the leadership 
of Xi Jinping. 
How has Xi Jinping ruled during this 
rise? He has eliminated his political 
opponents. He has stalled market re-
forms, used ethno-nationalism to unite 
his country, and his treatment of eth-
nic minorities has bordered on geno-
cide. In doing so, he has fostered a 
quasi-Maoist personality cult and a 
new form of totalitarian, high-tech po-
lice state. 
Anonymous writes: 
In what is a fundamental departure from 
his risk-averse post-Mao predecessors, Xi 
[Jinping] has demonstrated that he intends 
to project China’s authoritarian system, co-
ercive foreign policy, and military presence 
well beyond his country’s own borders to the 
world at large. China, under Xi, unlike under 
Deng 
Xiaoping, 
Jiang 
Zemin, 
and 
Hu 
Jintao—[three previous Chinese leaders]—is 
no longer a status quo power. It has become 
a revisionist power. 
That is very troubling for the United 
States, and this is the situation as laid 
out by the author of the ‘‘Long Tele-
gram.’’ 
What has the U.S. response been so 
far? It has been good, but it needs to 
improve. 
The author gives credit to the Trump 
administration for sounding the alarm 
in its national security strategy and 
national defense strategy with regard 
to the ‘‘strategic competition,’’ the 
‘‘central challenge’’ to our foreign pol-
icy, and great power competition that 
all have resulted from the rise of 
China. 
Anonymous writes that a simple, 
Kennan-like strategy of containment 
won’t be effective with regard to China 
because China has studied what hap-
pened to the USSR, learned from its 
mistakes, and understood that the in-
herent structural weakness with regard 
to the Soviet model itself was some-
thing that caused it to collapse, so 
China has focused on that. 
Yet, as I mentioned, the author em-
phasizes another central vulnerability 
of the Chinese system, one which he or 
she, the author, thinks we need to take 
advantage of. 
Here is what Anonymous writes: 
The political reality is that the [Chinese 
Communist Party] is significantly divided on 
Xi’s leadership and his vast ambitions. Sen-
ior party members have been greatly trou-
bled by Xi’s policy directions and angered by 
his endless demands for absolute loyalty. 
They fear for their own lives and the future 
livelihoods of their families. 
Of particular political toxicity in 
this mix are the reports unearthed by 
the international media of the wealth 
amassed by Xi’s family and members of 
his political inner circle, like so many 
other authoritarians who amass wealth 
through corruption, despite the vigor 
with which Xi has conducted his own 
anti-corruption campaign, which has 
destroyed many of his rivals. 
So what do we do with this informa-
tion? As Anonymous writes here—the 
author of the ‘‘Long Telegram’’—we 
need to focus on Xi Jinping himself. 
U.S. strategy must remain laser-focused on 
Xi, his inner circle, and the Chinese political 
context in which they rule. Changing their 
decision-making will require understanding, 
operating within, and changing their polit-
ical and strategic paradigm. All U.S. policy 
aimed at altering China’s behavior should 
revolve around this fact, or it is likely to 
prove ineffectual. 
This, Anonymous writes, has been 
the missing piece of the puzzle for our 
China strategy so far. 
While U.S. leaders often differentiate be-
tween China’s Communist Party government 
and the Chinese people [correctly], Wash-
ington [leaders] must achieve the sophistica-
tion necessary to go even further. U.S. lead-
ers also must differentiate between the gov-
ernment and the party elite, as well as be-
tween the party elite and Xi [Jinping him-
self].

That is critical. 
According to Anonymous, we must 
work to drive a wedge between these 
groups and to frustrate Xi’s ambitions 
in order to ‘‘cause China’s elite leader-
ship to collectively conclude that it is 
in the country’s best interests to con-
tinue operating within the existing 
U.S.-led 
liberal 
international 
order 
rather than build a rival [authori-
tarian] order [throughout the world], 
and that it is in the party’s best inter-
ests . . . not to attempt to expand Chi-
na’s borders or to export its political 
[authoritarian] model beyond China’s 
shores.’’ 
That is the juxtaposition of the sig-
nificant challenge we have right now 
with the current strategy in what 
Anonymous writes in this document 
that we should be building on. 
In building on these insights, the au-
thor emphasizes that U.S. strategy 
should comprise seven integrated com-
ponents. Many of us have come down to 
the floor to talk about some of these, 
but let me touch on a few: rebuilding 
the economic, military, technological, 
and human capital underpinnings of 
long-term U.S. national power, and I 
think we can all agree on that; agree-
ing on a set of limited, enforceable pol-
icy ‘‘red lines’’ that China should be 
deterred from crossing under any cir-
cumstances, such as forcibly invading 
Taiwan; agreeing on a larger number of 
‘‘major national security interests’’ 
which are neither vital nor existential 
in nature but which require a range of 
retaliatory actions to inform Chinese 
strategic behavior; defining those areas 
where continued strategic cooperation 
with China remains in U.S. interests; 
and prosecuting a full-fledged global 
ideological battle in defense of our po-
litical and economic models in con-
trast with China’s authoritarian state 
capitalist models around the world. Fi-
nally, all of this needs to be done in 
conjunction with and closely coordi-
nating with all of our allies in Europe, 
in North America, and, of course, in 
the Asia-Pacific. 
This last point is critical. Our allies 
are critical. We need to remember we 
are an ally-rich nation. China is an 
ally-poor nation. That is one of our 
huge comparative advantages in the 
geostrategic challenge that we have 
with China over the next decades 
At the end of the day, as Anonymous 
writes, ideas matter. Ultimately, this 
is going to be the contest of ideas—Chi-
na’s authoritarian model, which it 
wants to promote and export, versus 
the U.S. Western model of open econo-
mies, just societies, and competitive, 
free political systems. 
Over the long term, the author 
writes, the Chinese people may well 
come to question and challenge the 
party’s century-long proposition that 
China’s great, ancient civilization— 
thousands of years old—is forever des-
tined to an authoritarian future over 
which the people have no choice. That 
decision, however, must come from the 
Chinese people themselves. We can 
only provide a model, and we can only 
show the way. We need to do so with 
confidence and with our allies. 
As Anonymous concludes, there is a 
subtle, yet corrosive, force that has 
been at work in the United States for 
some time, raising doubt about our Na-
tion’s future, and some who are encour-
aging a sense that, as a country, Amer-
ica’s best days may now be in the past. 
Well, I, for one, certainly and fully dis-
agree with this, as does the author of 
the ‘‘Long Telegram.’’ We are a young 
country. We are a resilient country. 
Our innovation is beyond compare. We 
are a free country, and as a result of 
the long twilight struggle with the So-
viet Union, we also know what works: 
maintaining peace through strength, 
promoting free markets and free people 
at home, and having the confidence in 
George Kennan’s insights from 1946 and 
1947 
that 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, like the Soviet Communist 
Party, likely ‘‘bears within it the seeds 
of its own decay.’’ 
While 
democracies 
are 
resilient, 
adaptive, and self-renewing, there are 
many vulnerabilities embedded in Chi-
na’s perceived strengths. One-man rule 
creates acute political risks, as Anony-
mous has described, that we need to 
take advantage of. Historical grievance 
can breed violent nationalism. State- 
directed economic growth can produce 
massive overcapacity and mountains of 
debt. 
The gradual and, in some ways, ab-
rupt snuffing out of freedom in places 
like Hong Kong is creating sponta-
neous protests of tens of thousands of 
young people that we have been seeing 
now for months. China’s budding mili-
tary power and historical view of itself 
as a nation and culture superior to 
many others is alarming its neigh-
boring states, inspiring them to step up 
their security cooperation with the 
United States. Nearly half of wealthy 
Chinese want to emigrate, and these 
are the winners from China’s four dec-
ades of heavy economic growth. 
As we have in the past, Americans 
can prevail in this long-term geo-
political and ideological contest, but 
doing so will require a new level of 
strategic initiative, organization, and 
confidence in who we are and what we 
stand for. This also means we must re-
double our efforts in making the stra-
tegic case not just to Americans but to 
others around the world, particularly 
our allies. 
Let me conclude by saying that the 
‘‘Long Telegram,’’ while not perfect, 
sets out what I believe is certainly one 
of the best strategies I have read to 
date about how the United States 
needs to address the significant chal-
lenge that we will be facing for dec-
ades. 
I hope my colleagues, Democrats and 
Republicans, all have the opportunity 
to read this and analyze it, for, like 
Kennan’s strategy of containment, our 
China policy, to be successful, also 
needs to be very bipartisan and ready 
to be operationalized for decades.

CONFIRMATION OF PETER PAUL

Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I voted 
to confirm the nomination of Pete 
Buttigieg to be Secretary of the De-
partment 
of 
Transportation. 
As 
a 
former mayor, Secretary Buttigieg un-
derstands that infrastructure in a state 
of good repair is crucial to economic 
growth. For too long, American infra-
structure has gone without proper in-
vestment, while we simultaneously en-
gage in a two-decade-long adventure to 
remake and rebuild the Middle East. 
Rather than increase gas taxes, I hope 
to work with Secretary Buttigieg and 
the rest of the Biden administration to 
put an end to endless wars, stop build-
ing infrastructure in Afghanistan, and 
start building infrastructure in Amer-
ica.

REMEMBERING BARBARA A. 
O’MALLEY 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today I rise to pay tribute to Barbara 
A. O’Malley, a beloved wife, mother, 
grandmother, great-grandmother, dedi-
cated public servant, and a veritable 
institution here in the U.S. Senate. 
She passed away last month at the age 
of 93. 
Barbara Ann Suelzer, the daughter of 
Joseph and Martha Dix Suelzer, was 
born in 1928 and raised in Fort Wayne, 
IN. As a young woman, she was deter-
mined to learn how to fly. She obtained 
her pilot’s license when she was 18, 
using $100 she received for graduating 
from high school to pay for the lessons, 
and later joined the Civil Air Patrol. 
She was also passionate about politics 
and especially about being a proud 
Democrat. She went to Washington to 
work for her local Congressman and 
met her future husband, Thomas Mar-
tin O’Malley, at the Young Democrats 
headquarters; they were married in 
1954. 
Over the next 30 years, Barbara 
O’Malley raised six children—one of 
whom, Martin J. O’Malley, became 
Governor of Maryland. She was a de-
voted 
mother, 
grandmother 
to 
15 
grandchildren, and great-grandmother 
to 8 great-grandchildren. 
In 1986, with her children grown, Bar-
bara O’Malley returned to Capitol Hill 
to work as a receptionist for another 
Barbara—Barbara Mikulski—who was 
elected to the Senate that year. She 
was ecstatic to work for a female Sen-
ator. At the time, there were just two 
female Senators: Senator Mikulski and 
Senator Nancy Kassebaum from Kan-
sas. Barbara O’Malley stayed in the 
Senate for as long as Senator Mikulski 
did—30 years. During that time, she 
made the Mikulski staff, constituents, 
other Senators and their staff, and ev-
eryone else who visited the Mikulski 
office an extension of the O’Malley 
family. Everyone who knew her felt 
that bond. 
Mrs. O, as everyone affectionately 
called her, had an unwavering cheerful-
ness, a graciousness, and an uplifting 
spirit that made her one of the most 
admired figures on Capitol Hill and 
around Maryland. I always looked for-
ward to seeing her when I would visit 
Senator Mikulski’s office, which was 
located just around the corner from my 
own office. Everyone who knew her 
treasured her political acumen and in-
stitutional knowledge, not just of his-
tory and politics and Congress but of 
the very buildings themselves here on 
Capitol Hill. Her genuine devotion to 
public service reflected her strong val-
ues and character, which her own chil-
dren have carried on in their own ca-
reers and in service to our State of 
Maryland and to all Americans. Her 
legacy will live on in the hearts of 
those she loved, befriended, inspired, 
counseled, and mentored. 
Mrs. O set so many fine examples for 
her family and everyone fortunate 
enough to know her. I work on retire-
ment issues, and one thing experts rec-
ommend is for people to keep working 
if they enjoy their work and are able to 
continue meeting whatever challenges 
it presents. After Mrs. O spent 30 years 
raising her family, she returned to the 
workforce at an age when many people 
are retiring or close to retiring, and 
then she worked for 30 years, until she 
was 88. Mrs. O was a remarkable 
woman who gave enormously of her-
self. Myrna and I join the O’Malley 
family, Senator Mikulski and her staff, 
and so many other here in the Senate 
and across our State, in mourning the 
death of this wonderful woman, but 
more importantly, we celebrate and 
give thanks for her extraordinary life. 
As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ‘‘To 
laugh often and much; to win the re-
spect of the intelligent people and the 
affection of children; to earn the appre-
ciation of honest critics and endure the 
betrayal of false friends; to appreciate 
beauty; to find the beauty in others; to 
leave the world a bit better whether by 
a healthy child, a garden patch, or a re-
deemed social condition; to know that 
one life has breathed easier because 
you lived here. This is to have suc-
ceeded.’’ At home with her family, in 
her community, and here in the U.S. 
Senate, Mrs. O certainly succeeded. 
Mr. President, I am not the only per-
son who would like to pay tribute to 
Mrs. O. Senator Mikulski, who served 
in the Halls of Congress for 40 years— 
30 years in this body and 10 years in the 
House of Representatives—has provided 
a tribute. She is not only the longest 
serving woman in all of Congress but 
also the first Democratic woman elect-
ed to the U.S. Senate in her own right, 
the first woman to chair the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, an inductee 
into the National Women’s Hall of 
Fame, and a recipient of the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom award from 
President Barack Obama. As we re-
member Mrs. Barbara O’Malley, this 
great public servant and longtime 
staffer to Senator Mikulski, I thought 
it would be appropriate to share Sen-
ator Mikulski’s heartfelt tribute. I also 
have tributes from former Majority 
Leader Harry Reid; Senator Mikulski’s 
chief of staff, Dr. Shannon Kula; the 
Acting Administrator of the National 
Aeronautics & Space Administration, 
Steve Jurczyk; and a statement from 
the Civil Air Patrol. I ask unanimous 
consent that these statements be print-
ed in the RECORD
following my re-
marks. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT OF SENATOR BARBARA A. MIKUL-
SKI
ON
THE
PASSING
OF
BARBARA
A. 
O’MALLEY 
For over 30 years I have had the good for-
tune to know one of our state’s greatest 
treasures, Barbara A. O’Malley, and her pass-
ing on January 6, 2021 has left a hole in our 
hearts the depths of the ocean wide. 
Barbara Ann Suelzer, the daughter of Jo-
seph and Martha Dix Suelzer, was born in 
1928 and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, 
where she graduated from Central Catholic 
High School. During World War II and while 
still in high school, she joined the Civil Air 
Patrol, Group 523, earned her private pilot 
certificate in 1946, and then remarkably went 
on to work in the office of Flying Service. 
Shortly thereafter, Barbara Suelzer went 
to Washington, DC to work for Rep. Edward 
Kruse and then a few years later, while a 
committee woman at the Young Democrats, 
she met a young Georgetown University Law 
School student, Thomas Martin O’Malley. 
Their love of politics grew into a love for one 
another and they were married in 1954. To-
gether, they made a home in Rockville, 
Maryland and raised six wonderful children— 
four sons: Patrick, Peter, Paul and Martin 
O’Malley, as well as two daughters, Bridget 
(O’Malley) Hunter and Eileen (O’Malley) 
Schempp. 
To my amazing good fortune, her son, Mar-
tin O’Malley, became my 1986 campaign field 
director and later he went on to become 
Mayor of Baltimore City, Governor for the 
State of Maryland, and even a democratic 
Presidential candidate. But one of the great-
est things Governor O’Malley did for me 
apart from his own service, was that he rec-
ommended his mother apply for the recep-
tionist job in my new Senate office starting 
in January 1987. It was my distinct pleasure 
to have her on my staff until my retirement 
in January 2017. 
For all who knew her, Mrs. O, greeted 
every constituent with kindness, care and 
consideration in what was after all, the peo-
ple’s house. She had a great love of history, 
and she knew the history of the Capitol. She 
knew every nook and cranny, even the base-
ment, and when school groups came to the 
Capitol, it was Mrs. O who led the tour. She 
also developed relationships with other staff-
ers and loved playing poker—and became a 
legend for her skill at the game—especially 
with other senators. Indeed, her love of fly-
ing combined with her passion for history, 
inspired her volunteer work as a docent for 
the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum for 
many years. In 2016, Mrs. O was formally rec-
ognized by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol during 
their 75th Anniversary Gala and received a 
replica of CAP’s 2014 Congressional Gold 
Medal for her service during World War II. 
I, along with my entire office, counted on 
Mrs. O over the course of 30 years. She was 
honest, kind, and looked out for one and all. 
Her life was rooted deep in her Catholic faith 
and together, we served the people of Mary-
land and this great nation. My deepest con-
dolences go out to the entire O’Malley fam-
ily and to her extended Mikulski staff family

who also feel her loss. May she rest in peace

STATEMENT OF SENATOR HARRY REID ON THE 
PASSING OF BARBARA A. O’MALLEY 
Barbara O’Malley was beloved on the Hill. 
Mrs. O had an amazing love of politics, his-
tory, and the Capitol. She lived an admirable 
life. She earned her private pilot’s license as 
a teenager and later served as Civil Air Pa-
trol in World War II. She worked on presi-
dential campaigns and in public service, 
working for decades in the United States 
Senate. She was admired on both sides of the 
aisle. Mrs. O will be dearly missed by all 
those privileged to have known her. 
STATEMENT OF DR. SHANNON KULA, FORMER 
CHIEF OF STAFF TO U.S. SENATOR BARBARA 
A. MIKULSKI, ON THE PASSING OF BARBARA 
A. O’MALLEY 
Barbara O’Malley, warmly known as ‘‘Mrs. 
O,’’ was our source of joy and someone we 
counted on as always and was a fierce de-
fender of all of us as the BAMMER family. 
Every day and in every way, Mrs. O was our 
rock. We counted on her whether it was 
training new staffers, welcoming thousands 
of visitors during inaugurations, sit-ins, war 
protests, or, speaking with thousands of con-
stituents on every policy and political issue 
you could think of, day in and day out. Then, 
just as she promised them, reporting to the 
Senator exactly what they were saying. 
Every person counted and she took her job 
seriously. She got us through the dark days 
of 9/11, anthrax and ricin attacks. She helped 
us celebrate victories whether it was suc-
cessfully fighting for seniors who were due 
their social security benefits, the passage of 
important legislation on the Senate floor, or 
ushering in the holidays with her famous 
homemade treats. We loved her resident ce-
lebrity status too from legendary Senator 
poker games to her visit with Tony Bennett. 
Everyone knew and loved Mrs. O! 
She looked out for staff in more ways than 
I can count. For me, I started my days 
around 7:30 a.m. and it was a toss-up whether 
she or I unlocked the doors each morning. In 
those quiet moments, we’d catch up before 
the day began and the rest of the staff ar-
rived. Usually, she’d proudly share the latest 
pictures of her children, grandchildren or 
great grandchildren. Sometimes we’d then go 
to 8 a.m. mass together at St. Joseph’s 
across the street. She’d look after all the of-
fice plants and helped me learn to grow 
mine—even reviving the ones I thought were 
clearly long dead. Most days, I would be run-
ning around the Capitol, the Senate floor, 
meeting after meeting and couldn’t get to 
my desk until 4pm-ish and still had at least 
five or six hours of work ahead. But as I 
began to dig out, and was hungry from not 
having lunch yet, I would find a special Mrs. 
O tin of goodies waiting for me along with a 
sweet reminder note that was her mantra: 
‘‘Keep your eye upon the donut and not upon 
the hole.’’ Her brownies and Spritz cookies 
were favorites. We couldn’t be more grateful 
to have known her, worked alongside her, 
and to have had her in our corner. 
Mrs. O embodied exactly what I believe the 
suffragettes fought for 100 years ago. She not 
only did all that they hoped for and more, 
but then reached back to bring more women 
along with her toward this journey of a more 
perfect union. She was bold, feared nothing 
and no one, a trailblazer who literally 
learned to fly, raised and cherished a beau-
tiful family, had an incredible decades-long 
career in Congress, followed her faith, never 
said an unkind word, and was thoughtful and 
generous to everyone. 
I know this former pilot now rides on ea-
gle’s wings and that is a comfort . . . but I, 
and so many, feel the hole, despite the 
donut. Mrs. O will be greatly missed but 
treasured in our memories always. 
STATEMENT OF STEVE JURCZYK, ACTING AD-
MINISTRATOR, NATIONAL AERONAUTICS
AND 
SPACE ADMINISTRATION, ON THE PASSING OF 
BARBARA A. O’MALLEY 
The National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration fondly remembers Mrs. Barbara 
A. O’Malley, who was the first face and voice 
encountered by 10 NASA Administrators and 
scores of NASA staff in visiting or calling 
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski for 30 years. 
Mrs. O’Malley is an honorary employee of 
NASA, given her myriad interactions with 
Agency employees, her close attention to 
Agency milestones and activities, and her 
personal assistance in NASA interaction 
with the Committee on Appropriations and 
Chairwoman Mikulski. Mrs. O’Malley greet-
ed dozens of NASA astronauts visiting Sen-
ator Mikulski and attended all manner of 
NASA events—including commemorations at 
the National Air and Space Museum, con-
certs at the Kennedy Center for the Per-
forming Arts, and launches at the NASA 
Kennedy Space Center and Wallops Flight 
Facility. Mrs. O’Malley is remembered for 
her wit, sparkling eyes, and ready smile. 
NASA’s condolences are extended to the 
O’Malley family and extended Mikulski staff 
family. 
STATEMENT OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL ON THE 
PASSING OF BARBARA A. O’MALLEY 
Civil Air Patrol (CAP) mourns the loss of 
one of its original members from World War 
II, 
Mrs. 
Barbara 
Suelzer 
O’Malley, 
of 
Timonium, Maryland. She joined CAP in 1943 
as a cadet while attending high school in 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, and stayed passion-
ately involved with CAP throughout her life. 
She earned her private pilot certificate as a 
teenager and was a long-time aviation and 
space enthusiast. She loved working with 
young people interested in aviation, particu-
larly CAP cadets and she later served as a 
docent with the Smithsonian’s National Air 
and Space Museum. All this was in addition 
to her exceptional and long career in poli-
tics. 
On December 1, 2016, during CAP’s 75th An-
niversary Gala at the Smithsonian’s Steven 
F. Udvar-Hazy Center, Mrs. O’Malley was 
presented with a replica Congressional Gold 
Medal (CGM). She was one of only two to be 
so honored that evening. Presenting the 
award was retired Senator Tom Harkin and 
CAP’s National Commander, Major General 
Joseph Vazquez. In the audience was the Sec-
retary of the Air Force, the Honorable Debo-
rah Lee James, among numerous other VIPs. 
The CGM was given to CAP in 2014 for the 
unusual and heroic service of its volunteers 
during World War II. 
Civil Air Patrol is truly grateful for Mrs. 
O’Malley’s dedication and service to CAP 
and our nation over her long life. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to honor Mrs. Barbara Ann 
O’Malley, who passed away last month 
at the age of 93 after a long life guided 
by kindness, strength, grace, and hu-
mility. Mrs. O’Malley—affectionately 
known as Mrs. O to both Hill staffers 
and Members alike—served Maryland 
for 30 years in the office of former Sen-
ator Barbara Mikulski. The indelible 
mark she has left on our State and on 
Capitol Hill will endure for genera-
tions. 
Barbara Ann O’Malley was born a 
pioneer. In her youth, she hungered to 
fly and earned a pilot’s license at the 
age of 16 on her own initiative. But it 
was in the arena of public service 
where she would soar. Inspired by her 
father’s service as chair of the county 
Democratic Party where she grew up, 
Barbara started volunteering for polit-
ical campaigns when she was still too 
young to vote. Her passion for public 
service brought her from Indiana to 
Washington, where she worked for 
Democratic 
Congressman 
Edward 
Kruse and later became the national 
committeewoman for the Young Demo-
crats. 
And 
as 
a 
mother, 
Barbara 
O’Malley raised her three children on 
the value of serving others. Her son 
Martin grew up to be the mayor of Bal-
timore, Governor of Maryland, and a 
candidate for President of the United 
States. 
After 
her 
boys 
left 
home, 
Mrs. 
O’Malley turned to raising a new fam-
ily on Capitol Hill. She spread kind-
ness, collegiality, and community from 
the front desk of Senator Mikulski’s 
office for three decades. She was noto-
rious for dropping off treats at cowork-
er’s desks throughout the day, shut-
tling baked goods back-and-forth from 
the so-called BAMtry, a cache of 
snacks that kept the staff running. And 
she gave moral nourishment to the 
team by sharing advice cultivated 
through years in politics. Legions of 
Hill staffers, from new hires to chiefs 
of staff, turned to her for counsel. But 
it wasn’t just staff. Senator Mikulski 
likes to say that Mrs. O gave her the 
‘‘first briefing of the day’’ when she 
walked into work. Senators Jay Rocke-
feller and Arlen Specter could often be 
spotted circling her desk just before 
heading to the Senate floor. And when 
I served in the House of Representa-
tives, Mrs. O’Malley was always the 
first to warmly greet me on my way in 
to see Senator Mikulski, and I always 
relished the moment. 
If flying was her first love, then his-
tory was her second. She knew every 
fact, detail, and anecdote about the 
U.S. Senate, and for years, Barbara 
O’Malley’s Capitol Hill tours were the 
hottest tickets in town. She guided 
Marylanders of all ages and interests 
through the halls of American democ-
racy with trademark wit—never com-
promising between her reverence for 
the Senate and her taste for a good 
joke. At the front desk, she was known 
as the office historian, collecting the 
stories of constituents who passed 
through and maintaining a long cata-
logue of staff directories that she held 
onto throughout her life. She forged 
deep friendships and kept up with col-
leagues even after they left the office. 
That was Barbara O’Malley’s gift. 
She saw the multitudes that live in all 
of us and treated each person who 
crossed her path like they were the 
first and last thing in the world. That 
talent for compassion made her the 
soul of the Senate for 30 years and 
makes this loss all the more painful for 
me and for my State. But though she 
has passed, her spirit survives. Barbara 
O’Malley’s legacy lives on in the gen-
erations of Hill staffers, students, and

ADD1TIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SARAH MOYER 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing 
Sarah Moyer of Yellowstone County for 
serving her community in a time of 
need. 
When schools were shut down in 
March due to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
hundreds of children who rely on 
school for getting their meals were 
sent home. Sarah saw the need to feed 
her community and did not hesitate to 
jump in. Her business, Project Lunch, 
started to make healthy lunches avail-
able to anyone in need. By the end of 
the summer, Sarah and her volunteers 
had delivered over 21,800 lunches right 
to the front doors of Montanans—a 
truly remarkable act of service for her 
neighbors. 
Her dedication to her fellow Mon-
tanans does not stop there. Heading 
into 2021, Sarah opened a pay-what- 
you-can restaurant in downtown Bil-
lings that employs Montanans who are 
struggling to find employment else-
where. The community rallied behind 
Sarah and donated time, equipment, 
and resources to help get this res-
taurant started. Her goal for this 
project is to create a place for folks to 
give back and support their neighbors. 
Sarah has brought her community to-
gether, 
inspired 
volunteers, 
helped 
those in need, and started a legacy of 
service. 
I am thankful for Sarah’s dedication 
and heart for the Billings community. 
She has truly shown us all what it 
means to put service above self.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CHUCK ROADY 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing 
my good friend Chuck Roady of Flat-
head County. 
It is hard to imagine where the Mon-
tana timber industry would be right 
now were it not for the leadership of 
Chuck. The last few decades haven’t 
been easy on the timber industry or 
the communities that rely upon it for 
good paying jobs. Yet, throughout his 
career, Chuck has met these challenges 
head-on, fighting tooth and nail to pro-
tect timber jobs and advocate for the 
proper management of our forests. 
Growing up, Chuck loved the out-
doors and wanted to find a job that 
would allow him to be in the woods. 
After graduating from the University 
of Idaho College of Forestry, he worked 
for various timber companies across 
the Pacific Northwest. In 2003, he be-
came lands and resources manager for 
F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Com-
pany in Columbia Falls, MT. The 
Stoltze Mill employs more than 130 
hard-working Montanans. 
From the beginning of his time with 
Stoltze, Chuck became a leading voice 
in the community for our timber indus-
try and proper forest management. 
Chuck’s approach is to build bridges 
and find common ground amongst 
groups with different interests. His 
work has brought people together to 
find solutions that benefit the mills, 
the communities that depend on them, 
and our forests. 
Chuck has been a leader on timber 
issues on the national stage as well. He 
was a founding member of the Federal 
Forest Resource Coalition and served 
as its chair. In this role, he success-
fully worked to elevate forest manage-
ment issues to the forefront of our na-
tional debates, making real progress 
along the way. He has given us all a 
reason to be optimistic about the fu-
ture. 
I thank Chuck for his years of service 
to this cause and wish him all the best 
in his retirement.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING MIKE THE BORDER 
COLLIE 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing 
Mike, a Montana ranch dog who was 
crowned this year’s runner up for Farm 
Dog of the Year. 
As a dog dad to Ruby, Reagan, and 
Jessie, I know the important role a dog 
plays in life. Dogs are there for us 
through the good and the bad, and they 
are always happy to see you. Our four- 
legged friends are a source of laughter 
and always make for a good hunting 
partner. 
In Montana, our dogs take on an-
other role. They become a trusty ranch 
hand for many. Tim Feddes, a rancher 
from Manhattan, knows just how im-
portant it is to have a hard-working 
cow dog. That is exactly why he 
thought Mike, his border collie, should 
have a shot at American Farm Bu-
reau’s 2021 Farm Dog of the Year Con-
test. 
Out of hundreds of furry applicants, 
an expert panel chose Mike to be 
crowned as the runner-up for Farm Dog 
of the Year. Mike is a special dog that 
takes his job seriously and makes life 
on the ranch a little bit brighter. 
It is my honor to recognize Mike on 
this incredible accomplishment. He has 
represented ranch dogs everywhere, 
and especially in Montana, with pride.∑

TRIBUTE TO ELLIOT PERRY 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Elliot Perry of 
Bedford as January 2021’s Granite 
Stater of the Month. Elliot, a fourth 
grader at Bedford Memorial Elemen-
tary School and an ambassador for the 
Children’s 
Hospital 
at 
Dartmouth- 
Hitchcock—CHaD—has started a fund-
raising campaign to build two acces-
sible playgrounds at CHaD locations in 
Lebanon and Manchester to help im-
prove the experience of children who 
visit these facilities. 
Elliot was born nearly 4 months 
early and given only an 18-percent 
chance to live. The medical profes-
sionals at CHaD worked hard to ensure 
that Elliot received the best care that 
they could provide and 121 days later, 
Elliot went home with his mom and 
dad. 
Since then, Elliot has been one of 
CHaD’s 
best 
ambassadors 
and 
has 
helped raise more than $100,000 for the 
organization that he and his parents 
credit with saving his life. 
Last year, Elliot launched a new ef-
fort to support the patients at CHaD. 
The 121 Club that Elliot founded aims 
to raise $121,000 to build two sensory- 
neutral playgrounds that are compli-
ant with the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act’s Standards for Accessible De-
sign at CHaD locations in Lebanon and 
Manchester. With the help of his 
friends and neighbors, Elliot has al-
ready raised a little more than $80,000 
for his cause. 
Elliot hopes that these new play-
grounds will provide an outlet for any 
family who wishes to take a break dur-
ing longer visits, as well as provide a 
safe space for children of all abilities 
to play and develop their motor skills. 
Elliot embodies the best of New 
Hampshire. His drive to help others, 
along 
with 
his 
empathy 
and 
inclusivity, has made an enormous dif-
ference, especially for children facing 
particularly difficult challenges and 
their families. I wish Elliot the best as 
he continues fundraising to reach his 
goal, and I look forward to seeing what 
he accomplishes next.∑

‘‘(c) SPECIAL RULE FOR 2020.—In the case of 
any taxable year beginning in 2020, gross in-

By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, 
Mr. BROWN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, 
Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. BALDWIN, 
and Ms. WARREN): 
S. 178. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the de-
nial of deduction for certain excessive 
employee remuneration, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am re-
introducing the Stop Subsidizing Mul-
timillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act 
with Senators BLUMENTHAL, WHITE-
HOUSE, MERKLEY, BALDWIN, WARREN, 
VAN HELLENE, and BROWN. This legisla-
tion fully closes a loophole that has al-
lowed publicly traded corporations to 
deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar 
bonuses from their corporate tax bills. 
U.S. taxpayers shouldn’t continue to 
have to subsidize these massive bo-
nuses. 
Under section 162(m) of the tax code 
as amended by the 2017 Trump tax law 
(TCJA), when a publicly traded cor-
poration calculates its taxable income, 
it is generally permitted to deduct 
compensation costs from its revenues, 
with limits up to $1 million for some of 
the firm’s most senior executives. 
In the 115th Congress, the TCJA got 
rid of some of the prior 162(m) loop-
holes by taking provisions from my 
Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar 
Corporate Bonuses Act, including re-
moving the exemption for perform-
ance-based compensation, which pre-
viously permitted compensation deduc-
tions above $1 million when executives 
met performance benchmarks, 
While these steps were a start, even 
more should have been done, such as 
applying section 162(m) to all employ-
ees of publicly traded corporations so 
that all compensation is subject to a 
deductibility cap of $1 million. This 
was the only provision from my Stop 
Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Cor-
porate Bonuses Act from the l15th Con-
gress that was not incorporated into 
the Trump tax law. 
Partially closing these 162(m) loop-
holes saved taxpayers $9.2 billion ac-
cording to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation (JCT), but last Congress, the 
JCT estimated that fully closing the 
loophole along the lines of the legisla-
tion I am reintroducing today would 
save taxpayers an additional $27 billion 
dollars. 
Under this legislation, publicly trad-
ed corporations would still be per-
mitted to pay their executives as much 
as they desire, but compensation above 
and beyond $1 million would no longer 
be subsidized through our tax code. 
This is simply a matter of fairness, en-
suring 
that 
corporations—and 
not 
hardworking taxpayers who face their 
own challenges in this economy—are 
paying for the multi-million dollar bo-
nuses corporations have decided to dole 
out to their senior executives. Instead 
of showering corporations with addi-
tional benefits they certainly don’t 
need, we should be doing everything 
within our power to help more families, 
who are barely surviving, make it to 
the other side of this public health 
emergency. 
I thank Public Citizen, the Institute 
for Policy Studies—Global Economy 
Project, Americans for Financial Re-
form, 
the 
AFL–CIO, 
International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, and MIT 
Professor Simon Johnson for their sup-
port. I urge our colleagues to join us in 
cosponsoring this legislation and press-
ing for its passage.

S. 181. A bill to posthumously award 
a Congressional Gold Medal to Fred 
Korematsu, in recognition of his dedi-
cation to justice and equality; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce legislation to post-
humously 
award 
Fred 
Toyosaburo 
Korematsu 
with 
the 
Congressional 
Gold Medal. Fred challenged the illegal 
internment of Japanese Americans dur-
ing World War II and devoted his life to 
expanding civil rights and liberties for 
all people. Awarding him the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, Congress’ highest 
civilian honor, would be a fitting trib-
ute to his lifelong pursuit of justice 
and equality. 
Fred was born in Oakland, California 
on January 30, 1919, to Japanese immi-
grant parents. Although he was an 
American citizen, Fred was discrimi-
nated against due to his Japanese an-
cestry. As the United States entered 
World War II, Fred tried unsuccessfully 
to enlist in the U.S. military, and was 
fired from his job at the Oakland ship-
yard. In 1942, Fred was arrested and 
convicted of defying military orders 
issued under Executive Order 9066, a 
discriminatory presidential order that 
authorized the mass removal and incar-
ceration of more than 120,000 Japanese 
Americans during World War II. 
Fred challenged the constitutionality 
of the government’s order but was con-
victed in federal court of violating

military orders issued under Executive 
Order 9066. After a federal appeals 
court upheld his conviction, he ap-
pealed his case to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. On December 18, 1944, the Court 
ruled against him in a 6-3 decision, 
finding the government’s discrimina-
tory policy to incarcerate Japanese 
Americans was justified due to mili-
tary necessity. 
Decades later, legal historians dis-
covered key information that the fed-
eral government did not share with the 
Supreme Court, including a report that 
concluded very few Japanese Ameri-
cans represented a national security 
risk. After this evidence of government 
misconduct emerged and was presented 
to the court, Fred’s conviction was 
overturned by a Federal court in San 
Francisco nearly forty years later, on 
November 10, 1983. Fred believed that 
the Supreme Court’s decision was 
wrong, and stated, ‘‘I would like to see 
the Government admit that they were 
wrong and do something about it so 
this will never happen again to any 
American citizen of any race, creed or 
color.’’ Although the Supreme Court’s 
infamous 
ruling 
in 
Korematsu 
v. 
United States has been widely rejected 
by historians and legal experts, it has 
never been formally repudiated, and 
stands as one of the Supreme Court’s 
worst precedents. 
The internment of Japanese Ameri-
cans was a shameful act, and it was not 
until 1988 that the Civil Liberties Act 
was passed and our Government for-
mally apologized to Americans of Japa-
nese ancestry who were incarcerated 
during World War II. Fred Korematsu 
fought for this redress legislation and 
continued working to expand civil 
rights throughout his life. He spoke 
out against prejudice directed at mi-
norities and immigrants, and after Sep-
tember 11, 2001, filed amicus briefs with 
the Supreme Court, warning our nation 
not to repeat history by committing 
civil and human rights travesties. 
During his lifetime, Fred Korematsu 
did not choose the easy route. Instead, 
he chose to fight and speak out against 
injustice his entire life. He fought not 
just for himself, but for everyone, par-
ticularly minorities who could be dis-
criminated against based on their eth-
nicity. However, many of these injus-
tices remain, and can be reborn as we 
have seen with the rise in anti-Asian 
prejudice during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Fred Korematsu reminds us 
that we must remain vigilant against 
discrimination, particularly when it is 
disguised in times of emergency or for 
reasons of security. On January 30, 
Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties 
and the Constitution, we honor the life 
of this civil rights hero whose legacy 
continues to inspire people of all back-
grounds to speak up and fight for jus-
tice. This day uses one of the most bla-
tant examples of racial discrimination 
to educate individuals on the dangers 
of political scapegoating and works to-
ward a future that guarantees civil 
rights for everyone. I am proud to in-
troduce the Fred Korematsu Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act in his memory, 
and I call on my colleagues in the 
United States Senate to swiftly pass 
this bill during the 117th Congress. 
I yield the floor.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
24—SUP-
PORTING EFFORTS BY THE GOV-
ERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF CO-
LOMBIA TO PURSUE PEACE AND 
REGIONAL STABILITY 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. 
BLUNT) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 24 
Whereas, in 2016, the Government of Co-
lombia concluded a historic peace agreement 
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Co-
lombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) aimed at 
addressing the historical causes of the half- 
a-century armed conflict in Colombia, and 
the Government of Colombia is currently 
working to implement that agreement; 
Whereas the Governments and people of 
the United States and Colombia have forged 
a resolute bond through a shared commit-
ment to support peace, human rights, democ-
racy, the rule of law, and security through-
out the Western Hemisphere and the world, 
which has been bolstered by the support of 
hundreds of thousands of Colombian-Ameri-
cans and their contributions to life in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2000, the Government of Co-
lombia achieved a national consensus to 
build state capacity, and the United States 
committed 
to 
combat 
organized 
crime, 
drugs, and violence through its foreign as-
sistance in support of Plan Colombia; 
Whereas Plan Colombia and its successor, 
Peace Colombia, have received consistent 
support from each United States President 
since 1999, and from both Democrats and Re-
publicans in the United States Congress; 
Whereas, while the Government of Colom-
bia contributed more than 95 percent of 
funds over the duration of Plan Colombia, 
the political leadership, technical advice, 
military assistance, and intelligence-sharing 
role of the United States, along with the 
$11,000,000,000 appropriated by the United 
States Congress through Plan Colombia and 
Peace Colombia to combat narcotics traf-
ficking and transnational criminal organiza-
tions, strengthen democratic governance, 
promote 
economic 
growth, 
and 
defend 
human rights, played a key role in helping to 
transform a country on the brink of collapse 
into an increasingly peaceful and prosperous 
democracy, while also safeguarding impor-
tant United States interests; 
Whereas the Government of Colombia has 
made major investments and shown strong 
leadership, often at great cost and sacrifice, 
to consolidate domestic security, socio-
economic development, and the rule of law; 
Whereas, since 2000, levels of crime and vi-
olence have decreased significantly in Co-
lombia, with annual per capita homicide 
rates declining from 62 per 100,000 people in 
1999 to a low of 24.5 per 100,000 people in 2015; 
Whereas the alignment of improved secu-
rity and sound economic policies has trans-
lated into steady growth in the gross domes-
tic product of Colombia, which increased 
from approximately $86,000,000,000 in 1999 to 
more than $309,000,000,000 in 2017, and led to 
greater foreign direct investment, which 
grew from approximately $1,500,000,000 in 1999 
to one of the highest in Latin America at an 
estimated $14,000,000,000 in 2017; 
Whereas the United States and Colombia 
enjoy a robust economic relationship, with 
United States goods and services trade with 
Colombia 
totaling 
an 
estimated 
$36,400,000,000 in 2017, supporting more than 
100,000 jobs in the United States; 
Whereas the Government of Colombia has 
made impressive strides in reducing poverty 
since 2005, with the poverty rate decreasing 
from 64 percent in 1999 to 27 percent in 2017, 
according to the World Bank; 
Whereas, since 1999, the Government of Co-
lombia has expanded its presence across all 
32 territorial departments, has contributed 
to the professionalism of the Colombian judi-
ciary, and has improved the capacity of the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Police 
of Colombia; 
Whereas Colombia is one of the United 
States’ most consistent and strategic part-
ners through its support of United States 
diplomatic objectives at the United Nations 
and efforts made in combating transnational 
organized crime and increased security and 
rule of law abroad; 
Whereas, in 2017, Colombia signed a Memo-
randum of Understanding with the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and be-
came the first NATO partner country in 
Latin America; 
Whereas the gains Colombia has made are 
threatened by an escalating crisis in Ven-
ezuela, which has led to an influx of more 
than 1,800,000 Venezuelans into Colombia, 
and the need for continued financial support 
to implement the peace agreement; 
Whereas the internal armed conflict vic-
timized all Colombians, including women, 
children, and Afro-descendant and indige-
nous peoples, resulted in one of the largest 
populations of internally displaced persons 
in the world, and has led to the repeated tar-
geting of leading representatives of civil so-
ciety, including trade unionists, journalists, 
human rights defenders, and other commu-
nity activists who remain at grave risk from 
guerrilla groups, successors to paramilitary 
groups, organized criminal organizations, 
and corrupt officials and individuals; 
Whereas efforts to achieve lasting peace in 
Colombia must address the hardships faced 
by victims of the armed conflict, including 
implementing the Law on Victims and Res-
titution of Land of 2011; 
Whereas the prospects for national rec-
onciliation and sustainable peace in Colom-
bia rely on the effective delivery of justice 
for victims of the conflict, long-term solu-
tions for individuals who have been dis-
placed, and the ability to hold accountable 
perpetrators of violations of human rights 
and international humanitarian law, par-
ticularly obligations under Article 3 of the 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protec-
tion of Civilian Persons in Time of War, done 
at Geneva August 12, 1949 (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Fourth Geneva Conven-
tion’’); 
Whereas the work of the Special Jurisdic-
tion for Peace, the transitional justice mech-
anism created for the purpose of ensuring ac-
countability in the context of Colombia’s in-
ternal armed conflict, is fundamental to the 
implementation of the peace agreement and 
the consolidation of peace in the country; 
Whereas implementation of the peace 
agreement faces serious challenges, includ-
ing a dramatic increase of coca cultivation 
and cocaine production, a spike in violent at-
tacks against civilians, including social lead-
ers implementing peace agreement pro-
grams, and the enormous burden of a mass 
exodus of Venezuelans fleeing the authori-
tarian regime of Nicola´s Maduro; and 
Whereas, on August 29, 2019, Luciano Marin

‘‘direct spending’’, ‘‘receipts’’, and ‘‘appro-
priations for discretionary accounts’’ mean 
any provision of a bill, joint resolution, 
amendment, motion, amendment between 
the Houses, or conference report that affects 
direct spending, receipts, or appropriations

preted for purposes of the Balanced Budget

sidering a bill, resolution, amendment, mo-
tion, amendment between the Houses, or

amendment from the floor.

may be. An affirmative vote of five-eighths

SEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREAT-
MENT OF REDUCTION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS 
LEVELS 
TO 
ACHIEVE 
SAVINGS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-
cal year 1981, gave authorizing committees 
reconciliation instructions which amounted 
to approximately two-thirds of the savings 
required under reconciliation. 
(2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 re-
sulted in a debate about how reconciling dis-
cretionary spending programs could be in 
order given that authorizations of appropria-
tions for programs did not actually change 
spending and the programs authorized would 
be funded through later annual appropria-
tion. The staff of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate and the counsel to the 
Majority Leader advised that upon consulta-
tion with the Parliamentarian, the original 
instructions on discretionary spending would 
be out of order because of the phrase, ‘‘to 
modify programs’’. This was seen as too 
broad and programs could be modified with-
out resulting in changes to their future ap-
propriations. 
(3) To rectify this violation, the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate reported 
S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising the 
congressional budget for the United States 
Government for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 
1983, to include reconciliation, which revised 
the language in the reconciliation instruc-
tions to change entitlement law and ‘‘to re-
port changes in laws within the jurisdiction 
of that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings’’. 
(4) This was understood to mean changes in 
authorization language of discretionary pro-
grams would be permissible under reconcili-
ation procedures provided such changes in 
law would have the result in affecting a 
change in later outlays derived from future 
appropriations. Further it was understood 
that a change in authorization language that 
caused a change in later outlays was consid-
ered to be a change in outlays for the pur-
pose of reconciliation. 
(5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 
10 to approve S. Con. Res. 9 with the modi-
fied reconciliation language. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that committees reporting 
changes in laws within the jurisdiction of 
that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings shall 
be considered to be changes in outlays for 
the purpose of enforcing the prohibition on 
extraneous matters in reconciliation bills. 
SEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIV-
ERS. 
In the Senate, it shall not be in order to 
move to waive or suspend a point of order 
under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
U.S.C. 621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget with respect to a bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment, 
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report unless the point of order has 
been specifically raised by a Senator. 
SEC. 4009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION RE-
DUCING APPROPRIATIONS.

Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions in effect under section 302(a) of the

HONORING MS. SOPHIE PASIBE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
the life and legacy of Sophie Pasibe and to 
recognize the impact she had on the Filipino- 
American community in Vallejo and Benicia. 
Born September 29, 1931 in the Municipality 
of Agoo in La Union, Philippines, Ms. Sophie 
Pasibe’s life was characterized by her years 
as a teacher, philanthropist, and public serv-
ant. Before her emigration from the Philippines 
to the United States in 1969, Ms. Pasibe 
served her community as a fourth grade 
teacher. Soon after arriving in the United 
States, she continued her teaching career for 
the Stockton Unified School District. In 1975, 
Ms. Pasibe settled in Benicia, California, 
where she resided for the remainder of her 
life. 
Ms. Pasibe had a huge impact on advanc-
ing the interests of the Filipino-American com-
munity. She was a leader, serving as vice 
president of the Agooenians of California, 
president of Fil-Ams of Benicia, and chair of 
the Lakbay Aral Program. Additionally, she 
helped to found both the Young Generations 
of Agoo and the Solano County Filipino-Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce. Through her 
leadership, she helped to advance the pros-
perity and cultural expression of her commu-
nity through projects like the Lakbay Aral Trav-
el Study Program, a collaboration with the Fili 
Am Chamber and Philippine government to 
send Filipino-American teenagers to the Phil-
ippines, many for the first time, to connect with 
their roots through an immersive program. 
Ms. Pasibe’s dedication to her community 
further fueled her philanthropy, as she served 
as a certified court interpreter, traveling 
throughout much of California. Furthermore, 
she utilized her artistry and creativity to sell 
crafts at street fairs, with all proceeds going 
back to her home in the Philippines. Ms. 
Pasibe will be remembered by her selfless 
dedication to others. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Sophie Pasibe was a 
committed community advocate and excep-
tional leader who dedicated her life to serving 
the Filipino community.

RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL 
OF FRANKLIN ACADEMY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in celebration of the Bicentennial 
of Franklin Academy in Columbus, Mis-
sissippi—the state’s first Public School. In its 
two hundred years, Franklin Academy has had 
a profound impact on education in our state. 
In December of 1821, construction was 
completed on the first schoolhouse. A 20x30 
foot wood framed structure was erected to 
house the first classes, and in 1835 a second 
structure was built to separate the boys and 
girls. In 1866, a fourteen-room, three-story 
building became the new home of Franklin 
Academy. An adjoining chapel allowed for reli-
gious services and education. 
In November of 1909 President Taft visited 
Franklin Academy as a stop on a national 
tour. Nine years later, the school adapted to 
elementary students when Stephen D. Lee 
High School was completed. It wasn’t until 
1939 that the current two-story building was 
constructed under the Public Works Adminis-
tration. 
Franklin Academy was integrated in Sep-
tember of 1965. It has since been named a 
Mississippi landmark and is listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places. 
I commend all current and former faculty, 
staff, and administration at Franklin Academy 
for preserving educational excellence and con-
tinuously striving for the best quality education 
for our young people.

CONGRATULATING MAYOR HARRY 
J. PARRISH II ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate City of Manassas Mayor Harry 
J. Parrish, II on his retirement and thank him 
for his many years of dedicated service. 
A life-long resident of Manassas, Mayor 
Parrish was appointed to the Manassas City 
Council in 1993 and was elected to the Coun-
cil in 1996, 2000 and again in 2004. He had 
the honor of being elected by the Council as 
Vice Mayor in 1999. He continued in the Vice 
Mayor position until May of 2008 when he was 
elected Mayor. Mayor Parrish now completes 
his third term as Mayor of the City of Manas-
sas. 
Mayor Parrish has played an active role in 
his community as a member of many service 
organizations, including the Manassas Volun-
teer Fire Company, the Kiwanis Club of Bull 
Run, and the Prince William Hospital Founda-
tion. He is also a member of the city’s thriving 
business community, leading his family busi-
ness as President of Manassas Ice & Fuel 
Company. 
Mayor Parrish earned a bachelor’s degree 
in Aerospace Engineering and Physics at the 
University of Virginia. He went on to serve our 
nation in the United States Air Force from 
1973 to 1978. He then earned a master’s de-
gree in Business Management from Central 
Michigan University before returning home to 
Manassas. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Virginia’s 10th Con-
gressional District, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Mayor Parrish on his re-
tirement and thank him for his many years of 
dedicated and honorable service.

EDUCATIONAL 
SUPPORT 
PROFESSIONAL OF THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Tanya Durham as the Walton 
County Educational Support Professional of 
the Year. Since August of 2019, Ms. Durham 
has served the Walton County School District 
with exceptional passion and an unwavering 
commitment to serving others. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
It is recognized that the position of custodian 
can be difficult—but also rewarding. Ms. Dur-
ham has performed her many duties without 
hesitation, while always providing a friendly 
smile for everyone she encounters. 
Ms. Durham is revered by her Principal and 
colleagues for her strong work ethic and com-
passion. She selflessly considers the needs of 
both students and staff because of the im-
mense pride she has for her school. 
Her support and outreach extend far beyond 
the hearts and minds of her own students 
through her willingness to help wherever as-
sistance is needed. Ms. Durham has displayed 
dedicated teamwork by coordinating events, 
like ‘‘Family Night’’ for The Boys and Girls 
Club and the May Day Festival. I commend 
her for her steadfast willingness to serve as 
an example for those who matter most—the 
students and youth of our Nation. 
For all of her admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Ms. Dur-
ham as a constituent in Florida’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Tanya Durham for her many accomplish-
ments, and her commitment to excellence, 
professionalism, innovation, and collaboration 
in the Walton County School District. I thank 
her for her service, and wish her all the best 
for her continued success.

out troops to Topeka and Washington, D.C. 
this month to provide additional security sup-
port for the inauguration. 
A resident of the Third District in Shawnee, 
Major McElwee became a commissioned 
Judge Advocate General Corps Officer in the 
Kansas Army National Guard in September 
2010. During his service as a Judge Advocate

ployed to Kosovo in 2014 through 2015 and 
then again to Kuwait and Iraq in 2018 through 
2019.

Judge 
Advocate 
General, 
Major 
McElwee handles a non-stop flow of requests

quality work product possible. He dropped ev-

and two paralegals to help with the rolling out 
of troops to protect our state and national cap-
itols. 
One of the most rewarding parts of rep-
resenting the Third District is hearing about 
the exemplary service and accomplishments 
of my constituents. Major McElwee is certainly 
no exception and I commend him for his dedi-
cation to our state and country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
DERWOOD RAY BOYLES 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Derwood 
Ray Boyles who passed away on October 13, 
2020. Colonel Boyles was a dedicated serv-
iceman and dedicated his life to faith, family, 
and country. I join countless Mississippians in 
mourning his loss. 
Born March 20, 1928 to Silas and Lurline 
Windham 
Boyles 
in 
Lorena, 
Mississippi, 
Derwood Ray Boyles and his family soon 
moved to Jackson, Mississippi where he spent 
the rest of his life. Derwood was a founding 
member of the Jackson Boy’s Club. In 1946, 
he graduated from Central High School as an 
Eagle Scout and a member of the Order of the 
Arrow. While at Central High, Derwood was 
also a ROTC cadet, which enabled him to join 
the U.S. Navy near the end of WWII. He was 
selected to be a squadron leader at boot 
camp and spent his tour of duty in the Medi-
terranean area on the Providence, the flag 
ship of the fleet. It was on this tour Derwood 
had the opportunity to meet Pope Pius XII. 
Derwood returned stateside and graduated 
from Mississippi State University in 1951. He 
studied Accounting and soon joined his uncle 
at Dreyfus Insurance Agency—one of the old-
est agencies in the state. He was committed 
to his partners, continuing to visit the office 
into his 90s, and was inducted into the Mis-
sissippi State University Insurance Hall of 
Fame in 2007. 
While serving as the president of the Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, Derwood met Miss 
Jackson, Regina Harlan. On December 17, 
1957, the two were married in Rockefeller 
Center in a ceremony broadcasted on NBC. 
The two were married for over 62 years before 
his passing. 
Colonel Boyles dedicated 28 years of serv-
ice to the Mississippi Army National Guard. He 
was an active member of many veteran and 
military organizations. In 2006 he was award-
ed the Spirit of Volunteerism Award by the De-
fense Department. He also received the Medal 
for Exceptional Public Service, the highest 
level public service award given by the De-
partment of Defense. 
Derwood is survived by his wife, Regina 
Harlan Boyles. Other survivors are son, MG 
Janson Durr Boyles; daughter, Jennifer Boyles 
McCall; 
grandchildren 
Durwood 
Graham 
(Gray) Boyles and Connor Boyles of Dallas, 
TX; Carter McCall, Sarah Douglas McCall and 
Matt McCall (Laura) of Knoxville, TN. 
Colonel Boyles was an outstanding Mis-
sissippian who expemplified a commitment to 
public service. He dedicated his life to making 
life better for his community. I am grateful for 
men like Derwood who so humbly served our 
great state, and my deepest condolences are 
with those who loved him.

HONORING 
AHMET 
AND 
NESUHI 
ERTEGUN 
FOR 
THEIR 
FIGHT 
AGAINST 
RACIAL 
INJUSTICE 
THROUGH THE POWER OF MUSIC 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to draw attention to an article that ap-
peared on January 20, 2021 in the Wash-
ington Post entitled, ‘‘These Turkish brothers 
found their calling in D.C., championing the 
Black music scene’’ by David Taylor. The arti-
cle highlights the contributions made by Ahmet 
and Nesuhi Ertegun, two Turkish brothers who 
fought against racial injustice. The Ertegun 
brothers were the sons of Turkish Ambas-
sador, Mehmet Munir Ertegun, and navigated 
the heavily segregated and complex Wash-
ington, D.C. These two young Turkish men 
dismissed racist comments and individuals, 
and instead familiarized themselves with the 
black neighborhoods of Washington. 
The two quickly realized how racially divided 
the city was, and in order to satisfy their love 
for jazz, the brothers became familiar with jazz 
clubs on U street, record shops on Seventh 
Street, and were regulars at the famous 
‘‘Waxie Maxie,’’ where they would meet fellow 
jazz enthusiasts. Ignoring the racial barriers 
which divided the city and country, they 
unapologetically hosted jam sessions at the 
Turkish Embassy. The Turkish Ambassador 
received complaints from irritated neighbors, 
but simply ignored those who called the music 
‘‘disturbing’’. Enamored by jazz music the 
Ertegun brothers organized the first integrated 
jazz concert at the Jewish Community Center 
in the 1940s. 
Eventually, the Ertegun brothers founded At-
lantic Records in 1947 and the record com-
pany became the most successful inde-
pendent label in the country. Atlantic Records 
went on to work with Ray Charles, Ruth 
Brown, La Vern Baker, the Drifters, the Coast-
ers, Aretha Franklin, and Led Zeppelin. The 
list of music icons also included Stevie Won-
der and Mick Jagger. In 1995, the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame museum announced that its 
main exhibition hall would be named after 
Ahmet Ertegun. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Black His-
tory Month, I hope that my colleagues will join 
me in honoring Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun. 
Their story is a wonderful reminder that de-
spite numerous differences there is always a 
common unifying force between people. Espe-
cially during these times when we find our-
selves deeply divided, we must remember that 
we are able to come together despite our dif-
ferences, and work for a better future as the 
Ertegun brothers did through the power of 
music. 
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 20, 2021] 
THESE
TURKISH
BROTHERS
FOUND
THEIR 
CALLING IN D.C., CHAMPIONING THE BLACK 
MUSIC SCENE 
(By David A. Taylor) 
Turkish filmmaker Umran Safter has a 
special place in her heart for Washington. 
She had the international premiere of her 
first 
documentary 
feature, 
‘‘Eye 
of 
Istanbul,’’ at the 2016 Washington, DC Inde-
pendent Film Festival, where it won the 
award for best of the festival. 
Her new film brought her back to D.C. for 
the story of Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, the 
brothers behind Atlantic Records, and their 
early years as sons of Turkish ambassador 
Mehmet Munir Ertegun. The Erteguns, she 
says, ‘‘resisted all sorts of political pressure 
in the 1930s and 1940s’’ as they regularly 
hosted ‘‘Black jazz artists on special jazz 
evenings at the Turkish Embassy in Wash-
ington.’’ 
As teenagers, Ahmet and Nesuhi were 
smitten by jazz when they heard Duke 
Ellington play in London and were excited 
about moving to his hometown. But when 
they arrived, they were disappointed to find 
how racially segregated the city was. ‘‘When 
I first came to Washington, the stores down-
town didn’t carry any jazz records or blues 
records,’’ Ahmet said in a 2002 interview. ‘‘I 
had to go to the Black section of Washington 
for the shops that sold records of the music 
we wanted to buy.’’ 
He visited jazz clubs on U Street and 
record shops on Seventh Street, and became 
a regular at Waxie Maxie, the music shop 
owned by Max Silverman, who built the 
store into a leading music retail chain. 
There, Ertegun found other jazz fans, such as 
Washington Post photographer and reporter 
Bill Gottlieb, later a writer for the influen-
tial Down Beat music magazine, and Billy 
Taylor, who would go on to become a 
bandleader and for decades directed jazz at 
the Kennedy Center. 
Safter, 51, had read about the jazz concerts 
the Erteguns organized at the embassy. ‘‘It’s 
a great story. I said to myself, ‘Let’s do this 
story as a documentary.’ ’’ For the film 
(working title: ‘‘Leave the Door Open’’), she 
tracked down everyone she could find who 
knew them. In New York, she spoke with At-
lantic Records colleague Bob Porter as well 
as Renee Pappas, ex-wife of Atlantic pro-
ducer Jerry Wexler. Pappas had been friends 
with both brothers and had vivid stories. 
(Nesuhi Ertegun died in 1989; Ahmet, in 2006.) 
Safter and her small crew arrived in Wash-
ington in February 2020 for filming. Everett 
House in Sheridan Circle—which served as 
the embassy during the Erteguns’ era in 
D.C., and is now the residence of the Turkish 
ambassador—opened 
its 
doors 
to 
them. 
Safter also had sit-down interviews with jazz 
historians and radio DJs Willard Jenkins and 
Larry Appelbaum. And she interviewed peo-
ple who had interviewed Ahmet (including 
me). 
She pieced together a story of race in 
Washington, exploring how the Erteguns 
cracked barriers in segregation and the 
blowback they faced. When they invited

Black musicians to Sheridan Circle, the am-
bassador got complaints from White neigh-
bors. ‘‘They were saying, ‘Oh, the music 
coming from the embassy is so disturbing!’ ’’ 
Pappas told Safter. ‘‘ ‘Who are these peo-
ple?’ ’’ 
The ambassador, opting for diplomacy, re-
plied: ‘‘My sons are studying anthropology. 
That’s why they have all these people com-
ing.’’ Still, he was stunned when the embas-
sy’s White staff balked at eating meals at 
the same table as Black staff members. As 
his daughter Selma explained to Safter, seg-
regation ‘‘was not something we were used 
to.’’ 
The stories and images create a complex 
portrait of 1940s Washington. Historian Mau-
rice Jackson described to Safter an Ertegun- 
organized concert at the Jewish community 
center: ‘‘Two Muslim brothers bringing 
Black music to the center belonging to our 
Jewish brothers and sisters. This is his-
toric.’’ 
While in D.C. last year, Safter had planned 
to film a concert in the Ertegun Jazz Series 
at the Turkish Embassy, but it was canceled 
because of political events in Turkey. How-
ever, the crew filmed a jazz concert at the 
Westminster Presbyterian Church in South-
west Washington. They returned home just 
ahead of covid–19 travel restrictions. Pas-
sengers on their flight to Istanbul were al-
ready wearing masks. 
Safter counts herself lucky that her crew 
managed to complete most of the filming be-
fore the pandemic lockdown. But work on 
the documentary dragged. ‘‘It’s not possible 
to meet with the rest of my crew,’’ she ex-
plained in April. ‘‘And the main challenge is 
I can’t sit next to my editor.’’ She was work-
ing with Omer Leventoglu, who edited her 
2019 film ‘‘On the Wings of Hope,’’ about 
Iraqi Kurdish refugees. ‘‘He’s a great editor,’’ 
she said, but they could talk only by Skype 
or WhatsApp. 
Eventually during the summer they cob-
bled together a new editing process and went 
into postproduction in September. Now with 
a rough cut, Safter hopes to have a finished 
film very soon. 
But other hurdles loom, including financ-
ing and distribution. Movie theaters remain 
closed. ‘‘This is a very difficult time for 
filmmakers,’’ Safter says. In darker mo-
ments, she thinks back to her D.C. premiere 
five years ago. 
‘‘Because it was my first feature-length 
documentary film,’’ she recalls, ‘‘it encour-
aged me. That’s the reason I produced the 
second film.’’ She has submitted a rough cut 
of her new film to several U.S. competitions, 
including the DC Independent Film Festival 
and FilmFest DC. She hopes she will be able 
to return to the city that gave her that first 
boost.

RECOGNIZING DR. BARBARA 
CAREY-SHULER 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Barbara Carey- 
Shuler, a courageous community leader, dedi-
cated public servant, sagacious mentor, inspir-
ing educator, and loving mother, in honor of 
Women’s History Month. 
Dr. Carey-Shuler has been a powerful force 
for positive change in South Florida for dec-
ades. She is a trailblazer who has paved the 
way for many successful professionals, entre-
preneurs, and businesses. Her efforts have 
improved the quality of life for thousands of 
South Floridians. 
Dr. Carey-Shuler’s life is founded on a spirit 
of generosity. Her unselfish character is only 
overshadowed by her loving spirit and accept-
ance of others. She considers her ability to 
empower and inspire others as her greatest 
accomplishment. Regarding her passion for 
helping young people she says, ‘‘l want to 
exude my passion so that they will have the 
same passion to give back and help other 
young people.’’ 
Dr. Carey-Shuler was first appointed to the 
Miami Dade County Board of Commissioners 
in 1979. She made a major impact through 
her progressive policies and legislative deci-
sions. She initiated the groundbreaking legisla-
tion to create Affirmative Action and set-aside 
programs in Miami Dade County which are 
credited with creating more jobs and opportu-
nities for minorities and women than any other 
legislation in the county’s history. She also 
created the 15 miles per hour school zone in 
Dade County and was later adopted by the 
rest of the State of Florida. She made history 
in 2002 when she was selected as the first Af-
rican American woman to serve as chair-
person of the Miami Dade County Commis-
sion. 
Dr. Carey-Shuler has never shied away 
from an opportunity to help others or promote 
equality without regard to the popularity of her 
decisions. In 1990, she attended an event 
where the late South African President Nelson 
Mandela delivered a speech upon his release 
after being unjustly imprisoned for 27 years. 
The event was locally controversial but Dr. 
Carey-Shuler was among a small group of 
elected officials who attended because she 
understood President Mandela’s importance to 
the international campaign for human rights. 
Her courage and vision earned the respect 
and admiration of her constituents and was a 
large part of the reason she was re-elected 
several times. 
Above all, Dr. Carey-Shuler values edu-
cation as the key to a happy and healthy life. 
She was well-regarded as an administrator 
with Miami Dade County Public Schools. She 
was also credited with inspiring and advancing 
the careers of dozens of educators as an as-
sistant superintendent. She has an impressive 
educational resume of her own: Bachelor of 
Arts in Communications from Florida A&M 
University, Master of Science in Communica-
tions from Ohio State University, Specialist 
Degree in Guidance from the University of 
Miami, and a Doctorate in Education from the 
University of Florida. 
Since retiring from elected office in 2005, 
Dr. Carey-Shuler has managed very success-
ful family-owned funeral homes in Palm Beach 
County, Florida. However, she has continued 
her passion to help others and mentor young 
people. 
Her 
board 
memberships 
include 
Spady Cultural Heritage Museum, West Palm 
Beach Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta 
Sorority, Inc., Delta Heritage Foundation, 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Educational Foun-
dation, Pathway to Prosperity, among several 
others. 
Madam Speaker, in observance of Women’s 
History Month, I urge my colleagues and all 
Americans to please join me in recognizing a 
great woman, a great public servant, a great 
businessperson, a great mother, and a great 
American, Dr. Barbara Carey-Shuler for her in-
delible contribution to our community and our 
nation.

Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Robert 
‘‘R.G.’’ Moore who passed away January 6, 
2021. 
R.G. Moore was born on February 5, 1943 
to Albert R and Mary M. Moore in Louise, Mis-
sissippi. R.G. dedicated his life to service and 
state as a SSGT U.S. Marine Corps Veteran. 
He also founded the Marine Corps League 
and became a founding member of the Desoto 
County Veteran’s Park in Southaven, Mis-
sissippi. 
R.G. served 34 years and retired as Captain 
from the Memphis Police Department. He was 
also involved with the American Legion Post

Chapter No. 2. I am grateful for Mr. Moore’s 
lifetime of service to the United States and the 
state of Mississippi. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife of 54 
years, Diane. He is remembered by his two 
sons; Matthew and Mark; and five grand-
children, Jackson, Tucker, Rylie, Lucy and 
Lily. 
Mr. R.G. Moore was a light unto all who had 
the opportunity to know and love him, and he 
will be deeply missed. My deepest condo-
lences are with his family and friends.

TRIBUTE TO SGT. DAVID J. 
FERGUSON, JR. 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my friend, Sergeant 
David J. Ferguson, Jr. in honor of his retire-
ment after nine years of service in the United 
States Air Force. 
Sergeant Ferguson joined the United States 
Air Force in 2012, after his high school grad-
uation, and through his years of service, has 
risen to the rank of Staff Sergeant. David was 
stationed at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, 
Texas where he served in the 7th Security 
Forces Squadron. In this role, he provided a 
vital service in fulfilling the Air Force’s mission 
and demonstrated great resolve in protecting 
the 13,000 military and civilian personnel living 
and working on the base. Throughout his serv-
ice, he has exemplified the core values of the 
Air Force: integrity first, service before self, 
and excellence in all you do. 
Over the course of his service, his lovely 
wife and high school sweetheart, Colleen, has 
been a dedicated companion. David and Col-
leen have three daughters; in whom I am cer-
tain they will instill the same values and patri-
otism they have exemplified through service in 
the U.S. Armed Forces. They return home to 
Adairsville, Georgia in February 2021 to begin 
a new chapter in their lives as a family; and

HONORING LEE DUDLEY WALKER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Lee Dudley Walker 
of Martinsville, Virginia, who passed away on 
January 12, 2021 at the age of 90. Dudley 
Walker was a business and community leader 
who made a tremendous contribution to the 
Martinsville-Henry County area. 
Mr. Walker was born on July 20, 1930 in 
Martinsville to Virginia Dudley and Samuel 
Stanhope Walker. He graduated as the val-
edictorian of Martinsville High School in 1947 
and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy 
Scouts of America. The next year, he attained 
a post-graduate certificate from Riverside Mili-
tary Academy in Gainesville, Georgia. In 1952, 
he graduated from North Carolina State Uni-
versity, where he had served in the Reserve 
Officer’s Training Corps and became Cadet 
Regimental Adjutant. Mr. Walker served for 
two years in the United States Army and was 
assigned to the Armed Services Textile and 
Apparel Procurement Agency in New York 
City. 
Upon completion of his military service, Mr. 
Walker returned home to join the family busi-
ness, the Walker Knitting Company founded 
by his father Samuel in 1928. Samuel Walker 
also served as president of the Bassett-Walker 
Knitting Company. Dudley Walker became 
president of the Walker Knitting Company, and 
upon his father’s death in 1960 he led both 
companies. They merged in 1964 under the 
Bassett-Walker Knitting Company name. 
Under Mr. Walker’s leadership, Bassett- 
Walker grew. It built a sewing plant in Stuart 
in 1965 and in Hillsville and Brookneal in the 
1970s. It subsequently acquired yarn manu-
facturer Johnston Mills Co., opened divisions 
in Ferrum and Stoneville, North Carolina, and 
opened a distribution center in Henry County. 
At its zenith, Bassett-Walker owned 13 plants 
and employed more than 7,000 workers, help-
ing Martinsville earn its reputation as ‘‘The 
Sweatshirt Capital of the World.’’ The com-
pany became part of VF Corp in 1984. Mr. 
Walker operated as Chairman of Knitwear for 
VF until 1986 and remained on the company’s 
board until 2000. He acted not only as an ex-
ecutive but as a community leader whose 
businesses were an important support to the 
people of the area. 
Beyond his role in this industry, at the time 
so fundamental to the Martinsville-Henry 
County area, Mr. Walker was a dedicated phi-
lanthropist. Wanting to keep young people in 
the region, he became a driving force behind 
the founding of Carlisle School, playing active 
roles from helping to choose the school’s site 
to recruiting staff. He donated to Patrick Henry 
Community College, the YMCA, and the Boys 
and Girls Club of the Blue Ridge, among other 
organizations. He was a lifelong member of 
Broad Street Christian Church, which his 
mother had helped found. 
Among the recognitions Mr. Walker received 
for his accomplishments were the Heck Ford 
Award from the Martinsville-Henry County 
Chamber of Commerce and the Pillar Award 
from the Martinsville-Henry County Economic 
Development Council for ‘‘Lifetime Contribu-
tions to the Martinsville-Henry County Busi-
ness Community.’’ 
Mr. Walker’s survivors include his wife of 65 
years, Elizabeth Mitchell Walker; son Samuel 
Stanhope Walker II and wife Janice Meredith 
Walker; daughters Virginia Walker Hamlet and 
her husband Burgess Harrison Hamlet III and 
Anne Walker Poole and her husband Walker 
Lynch Poole; grandchildren Andrew Linwood 
Shelton, Blake Thomas Walker, Harrison 
Walker Hamlet, Lee Dudley Hamlet, Mitchell 
Hudson Hamlet, Walker Lynch Poole., Jr., Vir-
ginia Buchanan Poole, and Elizabeth Weaver 
Poole; and sister Spotswood Walker Box. I 
offer them my condolences on this loss of this 
great business leader and philanthropist of the 
Martinsville-Henry County area.

MS. 
JESSICA 
LANDRY 
AS 
THE 
OKALOOSA 
COUNTY, FLORIDA TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Jessica Landry as the Okaloosa 
County Teacher of the Year. For nine years, 
Ms. Landry has served James E. Plew Ele-
mentary School with talent, passion, and an 
unwavering commitment to her students. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
It is recognized that the teaching profession is 
one of the most difficult professions in exist-
ence—yet it can also be one of the most re-
warding. Ms. Landry has performed her teach-
ing duties exceptionally, while also being an 
active and supportive member of her commu-
nity. 
Ms. Landry attended Northwest Florida 
State College, where she earned a Bachelor’s 
of Science in Elementary Education. She later 
attended the University of West Florida and 
earned a Masters of Education in Educational 
Leadership. 
Her support and outreach extend far beyond 
the walls of her classroom through her in-
volvement in other programs, such as the 
School Advisory Council and Plew’s Parent 
Leadership Association, and serving as the 
Senior Building Representative for Okaloosa 
County Schools. Ms. Landry has spent her 
time outside of school hours as the Academic 
Team coach, Young Astronaut Club coordi-
nator, and as a mentor to new mathematics 
and science teachers. I commend her for her 
steadfast willingness to serve those who mat-
ter most—the students and youth of our Na-
tion. 
For all of her admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Ms. 
Landry as a constituent in Florida’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Jessica Landry for her many accomplish-
ments, and her commitment to excellence, 
professionalism, innovation, and collaboration 
in the Okaloosa County School District. I thank 
her for her service, and wish her all the best 
for her continued success.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
RICHARD RICE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate the life of Mr. 
Richard Rice who passed away on Saturday, 
January 16 at North Mississippi Medical Cen-
ter. His beloved wife, Jill, passed away in No-
vember of 2020. 
Richard was born in September of 1940 in 
Ware, Massachusetts to Thomas and Jean 
Lech Rice. After attending public high schools, 
Richard enlisted in the United States Navy. 
During Basic Training in Millington, Ten-
nessee, he met his wife Jill. The two were 
married in September of 1960. Throughout his 
military career, Chief Petty Officer Rice served 
as a meteorologist, forecasting sea swells and 
tracking atmospheric changes for missile 
launches. 
In July, 1979, Richard and Jill moved to 
Tupelo, Mississippi where Richard soon be-
came a household name. He was Northeast 
Mississippi’s weatherman and delighted chil-
dren each Christmas as the ‘‘Santa Tracker.’’ 
He was deeply invested in the community, fre-
quently speaking to local organizations and 
schools about his career in meteorology. He 
mentored colleagues at WTVA and was a role 
model for local broadcasters. Off screen, Rich-
ard was a dedicated husband, father, and 
grandfather, as well as an accomplished gar-
dener. 
Richard Rice is survived by his daughter, 
Debbie; three grandchildren, John, Robert, 
and Scotty; and three great-grandchildren, 
Lauren, Aaryn, and Chloe. 
Richard Rice was a local hero, community 
leader, and role model to many. I sincerely 
thank him for his service to the state of Mis-
sissippi and extend my deepest condolences 
to his loved ones.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E91 
February 2, 2021 
The labor of Black and brown Americans is 
integral to the history of our Capitol building. 
When the Capitol was first constructed, 
enslaved Black laborers were brought in from 
across the country to build the home of our 
nation’s democracy. Enslaved laborers were 
involved in nearly every step of construction, 
from quarrying marble and sandstone to ma-
sonry to devising the architectural innovations 
needed to install the Statue of Freedom in 
1863. 
Today, our Capitol continues to rely on the 
labor of Black and brown Americans. Our 
Black and brown custodial staff make sure the 
entire Capitol complex is pristine and acces-
sible to all that visit, and throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, they have worked to 
maintain our community’s health and safety. I 
see the pride they take in their work each and 
every day and thank them for their endless 
dedication. 
On January 6, 2021, Black and brown cus-
todial staff were in attendance as well. While 
media coverage has largely focused on the 
experiences of House Members and Senators, 
custodial and administrative staff throughout 
the Capitol complex weathered the siege all 
the same. Once the Capitol was secured, 
these dedicated employees were the first back 
to work, scrubbing the stains inflicted on our 
temple of democracy by the same rioters who 
made them fear for their lives. 
Our colleagues’ work to clean the Capitol is 
particularly commendable considering the ap-
palling racial nature of the riots. Former Presi-
dent Trump and his supporters spread base-
less allegations and lies about the integrity of 
the 2020 presidential election, including about 
the validity of votes cast in majority Black or 
brown cities. When election officials and the 
courts refused to overturn the results, a pre-
dominately white mob, including proud white 
supremacists, stormed the Capitol. After see-
ing these white rioters treated more kindly 
than protestors for racial justice often are, the 
largely Black and brown custodial staff were 
left to clean up the mess. They cleaned up 
broken glass, blood, empty bottles, and other 
items left by the mob. I read that a staff mem-
ber described the experience of cleaning up 
after the insurrection as ‘‘degrading.’’ To that 
end, I say we see you and we appreciate your 
efforts. Their work was not made in vain, nor 
did it go unnoticed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing these distinguished mem-
bers of the U.S. Capitol custodial staff for their 
hard work in the aftermath of January 6, 2021 
and for the professionalism they show each 
and every day.

PASSING OF JOHN J. SWEENEY 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
first met John Sweeney when I was 22 and 
his staff offered me a job helping nursing 
home workers organize with SEIU in my home 
state of Michigan. The union was hiring a nov-
ice, front-line organizer, but I was ushered into 
the office of the president of the national union 
to meet the man himself. He was modest and 
unassuming that day, and he never changed, 
even as he doubled the size of SEIU, even as 
he became the consensus choice to lead the 
only insurgent takeover of the AFL–CIO in its 
history, even as he helped transform its poli-
cies to focus on organizing, support immigrant 
workers and much more. John Sweeney never 
saw himself as being above any of the work-
ers he came to represent, and he fought for 
them with unquestioned integrity and an open-
ness to innovation and change possible only 
with true humility. I ended up spending five 
years organizing with SEIU, then returning 
years later to help his campaign to take over 
the AFL–CIO, and then working 11 years 
under his leadership there. Throughout that 
time, I trusted President Sweeney completely- 
he gave me big assignments and the leeway 
to make them my own. He drew the best out 
of me by letting me know he had faith in me. 
He tolerated mistakes, but not lapsed ethics. 
One story that captures John well is that 
when I was creating Union Summer, a pro-
gram to put 1,000 young people onto the front 
lines of union organizing and bargaining cam-
paigns in the summer of 1996, shortly after he 
became AFL–CIO president, he insisted on 
making the ‘Summeristas’ as we called them 
employees of the AFL–CIO, even though they 
were essentially doing a three-week summer 
camp. He knew it would be much more expen-
sive and a lot more work, but he insisted on 
taking full responsibility for every one of them. 
John put the interest of other people and 
the labor movement above his own, every 
time. I loved John Sweeney in an uncompli-
cated way that feels hard to describe and that 
I hope remains possible in our troubled world. 
He was an honest leader, a great soul, doing 
his best to keep faith with his God and lift up 
his fellow human beings. Godspeed, John 
Sweeney.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
SERGEANT JON MEADOR 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Sergeant Jon Meador for his 
service with the Grapevine Police Department 
and to congratulate him on his retirement. His 
30 years of law enforcement service is incred-
ibly deserving of recognition, and, on behalf of 
the North Texans he has dedicated his career 
to serving and protecting, I am proud to ex-
tend my sincere appreciation for his selfless 
service before the House of Representatives. 
I was impressed to hear of Sergeant 
Meador’s background prior to joining law en-
forcement, specifically his experience in the 
banking industry that he utilized to investigate 
financial crimes in conjunction with the FBI, 
ICE, and the Secret Service. The courage and 
dedication he has displayed during his many 
years of service in law enforcement is admi-
rable and the law enforcement community is 
better for having the benefit of his service and 
knowledge. 
In these unprecedented times, I know it is a 
source of comfort for North Texans to have 
law enforcement officers like Sergeant Meador 
working tirelessly to serve and protect us. It 
has always been my view that public service 
is among the most admirable of callings, one 
that demands the very best among us tackle 
monumental challenges in the name of self-
less service to others. Sergeant Meador’s in-
credible service to the public will be remem-
bered by many in Grapevine and I join them 
in congratulating him on not only heeding the 
call to serve, but for doing so with the devo-
tion and passion he has exhibited for the past 
three decades. 
It is my honor to congratulate Sergeant 
Meador on his successful career and retire-
ment.

in selecting a career path. She was often seen 
at the schools of her children, serving as 
homeroom mother, assisting the Girl Scouts,

Mrs. Rose Roberts is survived by her hus-
band, James Roberts Jr.; children, Pat Har-

IN MEMORY OF BARBARA 
ANSELMO CHIFICI 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD 
the following obituary for Barbara Anselmo 
Chifici. 
BARBARA ANSELMO CHIFICI 
Barbara ‘‘Mrs. Barbara’’ Anselmo Chifici, 
age 77, passed away unexpectedly on January 
23, 
2021 
due 
to 
complications 
from 
Coronavirus 
at 
Ochsner 
Medical 
Center 
Kenner. A lifelong resident of New Orleans, 
Barbara attended grammar school at St. 
Rita Catholic School in New Orleans and 
graduated from Academy of the Holy Angels. 
She also studied at Meadows-Draughon Busi-
ness College, Louisiana State University, 
Loyola University, and the University of 
New Orleans. Barbara was the owner and ma-
triarch of the independent family-owned res-
taurant group Deanie’s Seafood restaurants. 
Barbara came from a large extended Italian 
family of restaurateurs, where she learned 
the rigorous demands of running and owning 
family restaurants. Barbara was awarded an 
American Culinary Federation New Orleans’ 
Outstanding Foodservice Professional Award 
in 2013, and had been sought to judge cul-
inary competitions throughout the country 
during her career. She remained a fixture at 
the restaurants until the Coronavirus pan-
demic began last spring. Barbara was an in-
spiration to generations of culinarians and 
hospitality workers. As a widowed mother of 
seven children, she created a rich life for her-
self and her family around food, faith and 
community. Her achievements as a woman 
entrepreneur reached well beyond the expec-
tations of her generation. She instilled a 
genuine sense of hospitality, quality, family 
and pride into everything she did with moth-
erly poise and a steely determination that 
launched and sustained a New Orleans sea-
food restaurant institution for almost 40 
years. Barbara married her late husband 
Frank Chifici in 1963, and the couple oper-
ated a catering business out of their home 
and later two restaurants, Chifici’s Res-
taurant in the Central Business District and 
Gromboli’s in Metairie, before purchasing 
Deanie’s Seafood Restaurant & Seafood Mar-
ket in Bucktown in 1982. She was widowed in 
1985 after Frank passed away following an 18- 
month illness. The Chifici family celebrated 
38 years as owners and operators of Deanie’s 
Seafood in April 2020. Known for serving up 
overflowing fried seafood platters and boiled 
Louisiana seafood, Deanie’s became a local 
favorite that garnered national attention. 
The restaurant was recognized year after 
year among New Orleans’ best seafood res-
taurants and featured on numerous Travel 
Channel and Food Network programs. In 
2001, she opened the second Deanie’s Seafood 
restaurant located at the corner of Iberville 
and Dauphine streets in the French Quarter. 
Deanie’s Sea Food Kitchen, located at 2200 
Magazine St. in Uptown New Orleans, opened 
in 2018. In her later years, as her adult chil-
dren involved the day-to-day management of 
the restaurants, she sought ways to cham-
pion the values and people she loved. Bar-
bara created Pinchapalooza in 2009, an out-
door crawfish and music festival at Deanie’s 
in Bucktown benefiting local charities that 
was celebrated for 10 years. She had a large 
holiday display at her home that later was 
showcased in windows of the former D.H. 
Holmes 
Department 
Store 
Annex 
that 
housed her French Quarter restaurant, where 
she also introduced an annual Santa’s break-
fast and holiday sing-along series offered 
from 2013 through 2019. She enjoyed travel, 
dining, cruises, cooking and had season tick-
ets for the New Orleans Saints and local the-
ater. Barbara also had a successful real es-
tate business for over 40 years. She was past 
president and a longtime member of the 
Elenian Club of New Orleans, a philanthropic 
group of women of italian descent. She 
served in numerous officer positions for the 
St. Mary Magdalen Mothers’ Club and the 
Archbishop Rummel High School Parents’ 
Club, including vice president. Barbara was 
preceded in death by her parents Olga Eve 
Cazes Anselmo and Vincent Anselmo, and 
her loving husband, Frank Angelo Chifici. 
She is survived by her brothers Robert Vin-
cent Anselmo (Marlee Early Anselmo) and 
Dale Anthony Anselmo, her sister in law Vir-
ginia Chifici Tedesco and seven children, 
Mark David Chifici (Joan Dardis Chifici), 
Darren Frank Chifici (Chasidy Fonseca), 
Eric John Chifici (Christina Haley Chifici), 
Keith Vincent Chifici (Renee Gascon Chifici), 
Garrett Paul Chifici (Candice Schloegel 
Chifici), Chandra Eve Chifici-Scarber (Rich-
ard Scarber) and Candace Ann Chifici (Doug-
las Farrington). She also adored her 12 
grandchildren: Dillon, Erica, Alaina, Olivia, 
Nicholas, Therese, Sophia, Vito, Vincent, 
Dominic, Vivienne and Giovanni along with 
a huge extended family who admired her 
dedication and hospitality to everyone she 
encountered. Relatives and friends are in-
vited to attend the Funeral Mass at St. 
Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, 105 
Bonnabel Blvd., Metairie, LA 70005, on Fri-
day, January 29, 2021 at 1:00 pm. Reception 
will follow at the Msgr. Melancon Center. 
Visitation will be Friday at 10:00 am. A pri-
vate service will be held for her interment in 
Lake Lawn Park. In lieu of usual remem-
brances, donations may be made to Angels’ 
Place of New Orleans, 4323 Division St., Suite 
206, Metairie, LA 70002 and Ronald McDonald 
House, 4403 Canal St., New Orleans, LA 70119. 
The Mass will be live streamed on Youtube.

RECOGNIZING MS. LESLIE COONE 
AS THE WALTON COUNTY, FLOR-
IDA TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Leslie Coone as the Walton Coun-
ty Teacher of the Year. For twelve years, Ms. 
Coone has served the Walton County School 
District with talent, passion, and an unwaver-
ing commitment to serving her students. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
It is recognized that teaching is one of the 
most difficult professions—yet also one of the 
most rewarding. Ms. Coone has performed her 
teaching duties exceptionally, while also being 
an active and supportive member of her com-
munity. 
Ms. Coone is revered by her Principal and 
colleagues for her incredible willingness to al-
ways lend a helping hand. She holds high ex-
pectations for each student, and strives to 
help them discover their true potential; addi-
tionally, she engages her students with ‘‘Ac-
countable Talk’’ and ‘‘Stop-n-Jots.’’ 
Her support and outreach extend far beyond 
the walls of her third-grade math class through 
her involvement as an ILDA teacher, School 
Improvement Team member, and Grade Level 
Chair. Ms. Coone has displayed dedicated 
teamwork as a teacher mentor, and assists 
new teachers by sharing the knowledge and 
skills she has acquired throughout her own 
teaching career. I commend her for her stead-
fast willingness to serve those who matter 
most—the students and youth of our Nation. 
For all of her admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Ms. 
Coone as a constituent in Florida’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Leslie Coone for her many accomplish-
ments, and her commitment to excellence, 
professionalism, innovation, and collaboration 
in the Walton County School District. I thank 
her for her service, and wish her all the best 
for her continued success.

and graduated from Amory High School in 
1958 before attending Itawamba Community 
College and Mississippi State University. 
There, he studied Business Administration. He 
soon returned to Amory and married Ms. Ruth 
Mcallister in September of 1964. He was a 
dedicated member of St. Andrew’s Methodist 
Church in Amory, where he served as Chair-
man of the Administrative Board and President 
of the United Methodist Men. He was dedi-
cated to the Amory community, serving as the 
Paul Harris Fellow of the Amory Rotary Club, 
on the Board of Directors for First Friends in 
Amory, as a member of the ICC Board of 
Trustees and the ICC Alumni Board. 
In 1977, Thomas Griffith was elected Mayor 
of Amory. He served a 28 year tenure, dedi-
cating countless hours to the betterment of the 
community in which he was raised. He cited 
his term in public service as the pinnacle of 
his career. He was appointed to numerous 
leadership councils following his retirement 
from city government, most notably as Admin-
istrator of the Tenn-Tom Waterway Authority. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife of 56 
years, Ruth; two sons, Tommy and Dan; and 
four granddaughters, Erin, Sydney, Logann, 
and Reese. 
Mayor Griffith was a dedicated husband and 
father, a servant to his state, and a man of 
faith. He will be deeply missed by all who had 
the opportunity to know and love him.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
GLADYS 
EDWARDS 
WALLACE: 
CHRISTIAN 
WOMAN 
OF PASSION, VIRTUE, COMMIT-
MENT AND SUCCESS 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I first met and got to know Gladys 
and Vernon or Vernon and Gladys in the late 
1960’s and have interacted with them since 
that time. Of course, Vernon has preceded 
Gladys in transition. Gladys was born in Al-
berta, Alabama, came to Chicago with her 
Christian parents who were seeking a better 
life for themselves and their family. Gladys did 
what many children of solid families do, went 
to school, joined church, went to college, got 
involved in activities, met Vernon, fell in love, 
got married and the rest became history. 
Forty-eight years of marriage, successful ca-
reers, a productive business, charitable giving, 
helping others, giving advice, mentoring, pro-
viding work opportunities for others and being 
an integral part of life in a community. The 
question now is what can we do? We can 
thank God for the life and legacy of our 
blessed friend and sister who gave so much to 
all of us, her charitable giving, being a mentor, 
providing jobs, wise counsel, for being a rock 
for family and friends, for leaving a thriving 
business, a committed life, for leaving proof of 
her commitment. Gladys held every office and 
did everything at church that one could do ex-
cept be the Pastor and I suspect that she was 
some of that. She was a member of every 
committee and headed up every auxiliary. She 
retired from the postal service after working 
there for thirty years. She was always a part-
ner in the family business, active in the Mor-
tuary Science Industry and of course ran the 
business after her husband passed. She was 
a true professional and left a legacy of serv-
ice, a legacy of giving and a legacy of love. 
God bless Gladys Edwards Wallace, and 
may she rest in peace.

IN RECOGNITION OF SIERRA PA-

HS 
GIRLS 
BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Sierra Pacific High 
School Lady Bears Basketball Team for their 
victory as California Interscholastic Federation 
(CIF) Division IV Northern Regional State 
Champions. 
After reigning undefeated in the East Se-
quoia League and recording the longest win-
ning streak in school history with 20 victories, 
the Lady Bears of Hanford, California, de-
feated Colfax High School in the Northern Re-
gional Finals. Having claimed the South Re-
gional Championship title in 2018, the Lady 
Bears Basketball Team is the first in the state 
to win a Regional Championship in both the 
North and South. This season, they were also 
recognized as Cal-Hi Girls Basketball Division 
4 Team of the Year. 
While the 2020 California State Champion-
ship was cancelled in light of COVID–19 pre-
cautions, I know the Lady Bears Basketball 
Team would have represented their commu-
nity and school with the same sportsmanship 
and dedication they exemplified all season. 
Led by Head Coach Amy Bush and Assist-
ant Coaches Victor Chavarin, Jr. and Chris-
topher Kennedy, Sierra Pacific High School 
was proudly represented by Taylor West, 
Alana Roberts, Celeste Lewis, Taylor Whit-
field, Haillee Larios, Kylie Brasil, Angelique 
Brazil, Cristina Avila, Makayla Carre, Savan-
nah Torres, Annabelle Saavedra, and Lauren 
Zantos. 
I further congratulate Alana Roberts and Ce-
leste Lewis for their outstanding performances. 
Miss Roberts became the first of her school to 
achieve 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds and 
is the Sierra Pacific Girls Basketball All-Time 
rebounder with 1,357 rebounds. Miss Lewis, 
the team’s all-time leading scorer, earning 
1,832 points, was honored as Cal-Hi Girls 
Basketball Division 4 State Player of the Year. 
Additionally, I commend Alana Roberts, Ce-
leste Lewis, Kylie Brasil, Annabelle Saavedra, 
and Makayla Carre for their 2020 East Se-
quoia League 1st Team Honors, as well as 
Cristina Avila for her 2nd Team Honors. 
Off the court, these ladies have inspired 
many with their community involvement. This 
season, the Lady Bears Basketball Team vol-
unteered at the Episcopal Church of the Sav-
ior Parish Soup Kitchen, hosted a Community 
Youth Basketball Camp, collected 500 canned 
food items to support families during the pan-
demic, and raised $1,290 for the families of 
Captain Raymond Figueroa and Firefighter 
Patrick Jones who tragically lost their lives 
while responding to the Porterville library fire. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me congratulating the 2020 Sierra Pacific 
Girls Basketball Team for these accomplish-
ments and commend their unwavering com-
mitment to serving the Central Valley commu-
nity.

rule 2 shall not commence until the Committee on 
Ethics has adopted written rules, and the chair of the 
Committee on Ethics shall notify all Members, Dele-
gates, or the Resident Commissioner with pending 
appeals upon such commencement.’’ The rule
