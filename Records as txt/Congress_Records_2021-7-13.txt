Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 13, 2021 
No. 122 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

f 
DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 13, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DAVID J. 
TRONE to act as Speaker pro tempore on this 
day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
You, O Lord, have been gracious to 
us. You have dealt kindly with us, ac-
cording to Your steadfast love and 
abiding faithfulness. 
We ask You, then, to teach us this 
day. Teach us good sense and equip us 
with Your knowledge so that we would 
learn to rely on Your guidance and 
walk in Your ways. 
Sometimes in our frustration we for-
get Your promises. Sometimes when we 
are distressed because of overwhelming 
concerns and entrenched in intractable 
partisan perspectives, we lose sight of 
Your mercy which transcends any 
human judgment. Or, we fall prey to 
our own arrogance and self-preserva-
tion and ignore Your sovereignty. 
And so we pray that You would give 
us strength to loose the bonds of lies 
and falsehood, pride and conceit which 
seek to undo us. 
May Your justice and mercy, which 
You wield over all the Earth, dispel the 
injury inflicted on us or which we 
exact on others. 
May the integrity of Your word 
pierce the hearts of the callous and un-
feeling, even our own. 
Then may the depth of Your love 
humble us, that we would come to 
know that Your gracious plan is more 
precious than anything we value or de-
vise without Your blessing. 
In the hope of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

S4835 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 13, 2021 
No. 122 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Listen to our prayers, mighty God. 
We look to You with the vibrant expec-
tation that You are willing to do for us 
more than we can ask or imagine. 
Lord, we are grateful that our law-
makers can fulfill Your purposes for 
our Nation because of the strength 
they receive from You each day. Show 
our Senators Your compassion. Give 
them peace that will provide them with 
an anchor for life’s storms. 
Lord, provide them with the wisdom 
to face life’s challenges, believing that 
nothing is impossible for You. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will 
have my remarks, but first I will do a 
little bit of housekeeping. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 2311 AND H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there are two bills at the desk 
due for a second reading en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is correct. 
The clerk will read the bills by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2311) making emergency supple-
mental appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2021, and for other pur-
poses. 
A bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety pro-
grams, and transit programs, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bills on the calendar under provisions 
of rule XIV, I would object to further 
proceeding en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
democracy, no right is more sacred 
than the right to vote. And yet, across 
the 
country, 
Republican-controlled 
State legislatures are conducting the 
most sweeping and coordinated attack 
on voting rights in generations, fueled 
by Donald Trump’s insidious Big Lie 
that the election was stolen. 
In several States, limits have been 
placed on voting hours, polling loca-
tions, and methods of voting. Barriers 
have been raised to make voting by 
mail, absentee voting, afterhours vot-
ing, and early voting harder. 
Republican legislatures are not only 
making it harder to vote, they are 
making it easier to steal an election. 
They actually believe that. Donald 
Trump does the Big Lie, everyone 
knows it is a lie, and now Republican 
legislatures are acting on that Big Lie 
and saying we could steal an election. 
What is happening to our democracy? 
Stripping independent election officials 
of power, giving partisan election bod-
ies more control, even firing members 
of county election boards, this is what 
Republican legislatures are doing, not 
for fairness, not for bipartisanship but 
to jaundice elections. 
And if the consequence is Americans 
of all parties feel that the elections are 
not fair, what is going to happen to 
this sacred and wonderful democracy? 
Republicans are actively dismantling 
all the barriers that prevented Donald 
Trump from subverting our elections in 
2020. Imagine if they hadn’t been in ef-
fect. Imagine. 
All of these efforts have an Orwellian 
logic. Under the guise of ‘‘election in-
tegrity,’’ Republican legislatures are 
sowing more doubt about our elections 
through phony audits and fact-free 
claims of voter fraud, lying claims of 
voter fraud. They are lying. I just saw 
on TV this morning how the Trump 
lawyers are being lambasted in court. 
And even Rudy Giuliani has lost his li-
cense to practice because they lied 
about the election, that they per-
petrated the Big Lie in legal docu-
ments. The same thing is happening ev-
erywhere. What is happening to this 
Republican Party? What is happening? 
When Donald Trump, the biggest liar 
we have ever had as President, sets the 
tone and they follow in those lies, re-
peat those lies, sometimes even embel-
lish on those lies, what is happening to 
that party, the party of Abraham Lin-
coln? 
Falsely claiming that the election 
was ‘‘stolen,’’ Republican legislatures 
are making elections easier to over-
turn, even under the falsest and biggest

July 13, 2021 
of lies. And what happens here? Our 
Republican friends here in Washington 
have chosen a path of supine compli-
ance, refusing to stand up to the Big 
Lie, bowing down before it, bowing 
down before Donald Trump, the biggest 
liar that we have ever had as an Amer-
ican President, except when the Cap-
itol Building is literally under siege. 
And, by the way, just parentheti-
cally, I commend to my colleagues and 
to all Americans—the New York Times 
did a video of the siege. They even had 
some—they showed the siege; they 
showed the violence; and they had 
some Republican Congressmen saying 
it was like tourists. It was incredible. I 
recommend 
everyone 
should 
watch 
this. 
And 
I 
hope—Republican 
col-
leagues, just watch it. You were there. 
Just watch it. I commend the New 
York Times. They did a great job on it. 
Anyway, the effort to fight this wave 
of voter suppression and Republican 
election rigging is strong and growing. 
I want to be very clear about that. 
In Texas, where the Republican Gov-
ernor has called a special session to re-
consider one of the most restrictive 
voting laws in the Nation, Democrats 
are doing all they can to block the dan-
gerous partisan bill. They are brave. 
They are bold. They are courageous, 
and history will show them on the side 
of right and the Republican Governor— 
I saw him on TV this morning—on the 
side of deep, dark, ugly wrong. Many of 
these lawmakers from Texas have 
come to Washington. I will be meeting 
with a group of them today to plot out 
strategy and to praise them for what 
they are doing. 
President Biden will also address the 
issue of voting rights in a major na-
tional address in Philadelphia, using 
the bully pulpit to draw the Nation’s 
attention and announce ways in which 
his administration can defend Ameri-
cans’ fundamental rights. 
And next week, Senator KLOBUCHAR— 
always on the ball on these issues—will 
lead the Senate Rules Committee to 
the State of Georgia—your State, I say 
to the Presiding Officer—for their first 
field hearing in 20 years. It will be an 
opportunity to shine a spotlight on the 
consequences of the Big Lie and show 
the American people just how far Re-
publicans have gone in order to make 
it harder—harder—for people to vote in 
the 2020 election. 
The bottom line is this: Democrats 
will not stop fighting to protect voting 
rights and defend our democracy. As I 
said, the vote in June was the opening 
gun, not the finish line. 
Last month, all 50 Senate Democrats 
united for the first time this Congress 
to move forward on a strong voting 
rights bill. Shamefully, shamefully, 
Republicans refused to even allow de-
bate on voting rights legislation, hid-
ing behind some of the exact same 
States’ rights arguments, and very 
similar arguments, that southern Sen-
ators used in the 1960s to oppose the 
Voting Rights Act. How do you feel 
about that, Republicans and Repub-
lican leadership? How do you feel about 
using the same arguments that were 
used by some of the arch segregation-
ists to stop voting rights in the Senate 
in the 1960s? 
Last month, as I said, the vote rep-
resented the starting gun, not the fin-
ish line, in the fight to protect voting 
rights. As majority leader, I reserve 
the right to bring back voting rights 
and democracy reform for another vote 
on the Senate floor. 
f 
CLIMATE AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on another issue, infrastructure and 
climate. Over the past few weeks, we 
have seen an awful heat wave hit Or-
egon and Washington. Those States in 
the beautiful Northwest, always known 
for their cool summer breezes, had 
temperatures like 115 degrees. It was 
just astounding, not just a little tem-
perature bump but dramatically un-
usual. 
Temperatures in the Pacific North-
west climbed so high that power cables 
melted and roadways cracked in two. 
At the same time, in the American 
Southwest, the lack of rainfall and de-
pleted reservoirs have led to a historic 
lack of water. According to the Na-
tional 
Drought 
Mitigation 
Center, 
more than 77 percent of the great State 
of New Mexico is in a state of severe 
drought. 
As climate change continues to wors-
en, extreme weather like this, unfortu-
nately, is only becoming more com-
mon, putting our agriculture, our in-
frastructure, our economy, and our 
people’s health at grave risk. 
That is why I have made addressing 
the climate crisis in a bold way a pri-
mary focus of our upcoming debate on 
infrastructure. We are working with 
great urgency to make this happen. 
And we are going to do it in two ways: 
First, climate change has forced us 
to repair and rebuild our infrastructure 
in a way that takes into account our 
new reality. Our infrastructure must 
become more resilient to extreme 
weather. In New York, I insisted that 
the Hurricane Sandy aid, for which 
New York and New Jersey got $60 bil-
lion, focus on resiliency. And as we re-
build from Hurricane Sandy using 
those Federal dollars, we have done it 
in a way that makes flooding in down-
town New York City and Long Island 
less likely. We need to repeat that ef-
fort across the country to deal with 
heat waves, droughts, wildfires, more 
powerful hurricanes and even more. 
But, second, we must use infrastruc-
ture investment to combat climate 
change itself, not just make ourselves 
more resilient. If it keeps getting 
worse, resiliency goes up, global warm-
ing gets higher—resiliency goes up. We 
need to have this go down. That is so, 
so important. 
And what are we doing? In President 
Biden’s proposal and in the proposals 
Democrats are putting forward, we are 
investing in green infrastructure, clean 
and renewable power, electric vehicles 
and charging infrastructure, and retro-
fitting our economy to reduce carbon 
emissions and slow climate change in 
both urban, suburban, and rural areas. 
Investing in both elements—resiliency 
and green infrastructure—that will cre-
ate thousands upon thousands of good- 
paying union American jobs in the 
process. 
So as discussions continue on both a 
bipartisan infrastructure bill and a 
budget resolution, Senators of both 
parties 
must 
understand 
that 
the 
issues of climate change and infra-
structure 
cannot—cannot—be 
sepa-
rated from one another. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 3 
months 
ago, 
President 
Biden 
an-
nounced his intention to completely 
withdraw U.S. forces from the ongoing 
fight against terrorists and terrorist 
enablers in Afghanistan. I said then 
this was a shortsighted decision, and 
sure enough—sure enough—a reckless 
rush for the exits is becoming a global 
embarrassment. 
Just take the reports that our forces 
slunk away from the strategically vital 
Bagram Air Base in the middle of the 
night without plan for our Afghan 
partners to secure the base or even to 
keep the electricity on. But President 
Biden remains defiant. He has rejected 
warnings that the government in Kabul 
will fall to the Taliban. He is ignoring 
the truth unfolding before our own 
eyes: Afghanistan is unraveling. 
Since April 13, the Taliban has re-
taken 
administrative 
districts 
all 
across the country at a truly alarming 
pace. With military victory in reach, 
the group is hardly even pretending to 
seek a negotiated solution. It has wast-
ed no time dragging large swaths of Af-
ghanistan back under its repression, 
but President Biden appears unmoved. 
He says he bears no responsibility for 
the plight of the Afghans who fought 
with us. 
Back in 2019, when his predecessor 
was contemplating a quick withdrawal 
from 
Syria, 
then-Candidate 
Biden 
called that notion ‘‘the most shameful 
thing any president has done in modern 
history in terms of foreign policy.’’ 
Well, look where we are today. The 
Taliban is hunting down the U.S.- 
trained pilots who helped defend the 
Afghan people. It has wiped out scores 
of special forces resisting its advance. 
As the Taliban moves toward threat-
ening Kabul, the Biden administration 
seems to have no plan to efficiently 
process special visas for the Afghans 
who helped us and no plan to get those 
people safe passage to our Embassy or, 
for that matter, even out of the coun-
try.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4837 
July 13, 2021 
The dangers facing the Afghan peo-
ple—especially, especially women and 
girls—are heartbreaking. The humani-
tarian crisis may well be historic. But 
this is also an awful, bungled mess 
from the perspective of our own na-
tional security. The President’s own 
CIA Director told Senators this deci-
sion would be certain to inhibit our 
ability to collect intelligence. Gen. 
Frank McKenzie of Central Command 
confirmed this week, this very week, 
that intelligence collection was al-
ready suffering. 
The President’s top advisers under-
stand very well that the Taliban is ca-
pable of retaking control of Afghani-
stan in just a matter of months. This 
would allow al-Qaida to reconstitute. 
So analysts are debating not if, not 
whether, but when al-Qaida will again 
threaten the United States from Af-
ghanistan. 
Just wait until we see Russia and 
China rushing into the void, exploiting 
our retreat to expand their power and 
influence in Central Asia. Just wait 
until the botched retreat and lingering 
threats end up requiring a large, ongo-
ing presence of our military and sur-
veillance forces in the region rather 
than freeing up resources for the Indo- 
Pacific. Just wait until the Biden ad-
ministration ends up consumed with 
this humanitarian catastrophe in Af-
ghanistan and its destabilizing effects 
rather than focusing on building coali-
tions to counter Chinese or Russian ag-
gression. 
Yet, amid all this, President Biden 
isn’t reconsidering. Instead, he is floor-
ing it. The administration actually 
sped up the withdrawal so it can ac-
complish it even before the darkly 
ironic deadline of September 11. 
So I have forcefully opposed efforts 
by Presidents of both parties to cut 
and run from our work in Syria or Af-
ghanistan. I have warned of the huge 
strategic price America would pay if 
this administration pretends that ter-
rorists will play nicely with their polit-
ical timeline. As one recent headline 
put it, ‘‘We might be done with jihadis 
but they are not done with us.’’ 
President Biden and his team are des-
perate to duck hard questions about 
Afghanistan, but the American people 
deserve answers. They deserve to un-
derstand the risks of this trajectory 
and how the Commander in Chief plans 
to keep us safe against a terrorist 
enemy that his own senior advisers 
admit will be allowed to regroup 
thanks to the President’s actions. 
I hope that, even in this Democrat-
ically controlled Congress, our na-
tional security committees will uphold 
their obligation to oversee this unfold-
ing debacle and its implications. End-
ing our presence in Afghanistan will 
not end the terrorist war against us. 
Sadly, the opposite is likely to be true. 
This self-inflicted wound could very 
well make the struggle even more dif-
ficult and even more dangerous. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a totally different matter, Senators 
have just spent 2 weeks traveling our 
home States and hearing what is on 
the minds of working families. I got to 
spend time with all kinds of hard-work-
ing Kentuckians across the Bluegrass. 
There is no question we are in better 
shape than we were a year ago. Thanks 
to the genius of science, the success of 
Operation Warp Speed, and the bipar-
tisan rescue packages the Republican- 
led Senate passed in 2020, the year 2021 
was primed and set up for a historic 
American comeback well before the 
new Democratic Congress or the new 
Democratic administration was even 
sworn in. 
But Democrats still wanted to rush 
ahead with the huge borrowing and 
spending sprees they had promised 
their far left. Top economists, includ-
ing famous Democrats, warned our col-
leagues to think again. Even liberal ex-
perts tried to warn our colleagues that 
the socialist ideas they had drawn up 
in 2020 were not suited to what Ameri-
cans needed in 2021. Overspending and 
overborrowing would unleash inflation, 
slow rehiring, and hurt small busi-
nesses. 
All that was predicted, but Demo-
crats rushed ahead. They rammed 
through what the White House bragged 
was the most leftwing legislation in 
our Nation’s history, and now Demo-
crats want to follow up with an even 
more absurd summer sequel. 
Well, let me tell you, I just spent 2 
weeks hearing from my fellow Ken-
tuckians, and they are already paying 
a heavy price. Manufacturers are still 
absolutely hammered by supply chain 
shocks. Employers large and small say 
Democrats’ special bonus for workers 
to stay unemployed is badly hampering 
their ability to fully reopen and to 
serve their customers. Most of our sur-
rounding States have already put a 
stop to this awful idea, but Kentucky’s 
Governor, regretfully, hasn’t. 
It isn’t just for-profit businesses, ei-
ther, that are having trouble getting 
people back to work. I heard from one 
residential treatment center for preg-
nant women and new moms grappling 
with substance abuse. They said that 
because of the generous Federal bonus 
for staying home, they have had trou-
ble finding enough support staff to 
even reopen one of their facilities post- 
COVID. About 80 percent of the people 
who schedule an interview don’t even 
show up. 
These backward bonuses have also in-
vited heaps—heaps—of fraud. In Cali-
fornia, for example, a significant share 
of the State’s COVID unemployment 
benefits were paid out fraudulently, 
billions and billions of dollars to people 
who shouldn’t have gotten them at all. 
And now—get this—Democrats want to 
give the California labor secretary who 
was in charge of that nightmare a pro-
motion. In fact, we are scheduled to 
vote on her confirmation today to a 
leading position at the Department of 
Labor. You really can’t make this stuff 
up. 
And then there is inflation. Just this 
morning, we learned that runaway in-
flation has continued to hit working 
families and hit them hard. Consumer 
prices spiked in June considerably 
more than had been forecast. Inflation 
is up 5.4 percent year over year—the 
fastest jump in 13 years. Stunningly, it 
is up 0.9 percent just month over 
month. Families are feeling it every-
where, from the supermarket to the 
gas pumps, to housing, to the used car 
lot, and beyond—all thanks in part to 
the Democrats’ half-baked spending 
spree from the springtime. Now they 
want an even more absurd, even more 
damaging summer sequel. 
What Democrats say they want to 
force through this summer through 
reconciliation would make our current 
inflationary mess look like small pota-
toes. Nobody seriously thinks our 
country needs another gigantic over-
dose of overborrowing, overspending, 
and overtaxing. 
This isn’t what the American people 
voted for, either. Our distinguished col-
league, 
the 
junior 
Senator 
from 
Vermont, the chair of the Budget Com-
mittee, has been very transparent 
about his socialist ideology for dec-
ades, very upfront about it, but the 
country didn’t elect a 50–50 Senate and 
a President who claimed to be a mod-
erate so that Chairman SANDERS could 
turn America into a socialist country. 
Working Americans know that is not 
what they voted for. This summer they 
will see who wants to borrow and spend 
trillions more dollars for no reason and 
who would rather help them get their 
jobs back, their stable prices back, 
their small businesses back, and their 
lives back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4838 
July 13, 2021 
hadn’t seen in the last year and a half, 
the kind of dialogue and communica-
tion which I think is an important part 
of my job and an important part of un-
derstanding the world today. 
They had one consistent message. 
Despite the fact that they felt a close-
ness to the United States that had been 
built up over decades of generations, 
there was a new factor in Central and 
South America which each one of them 
repeated as significant in the future of 
that region. The new factor is the ar-
rival of China. 
In each one of these countries, large 
and small, China has become a player, 
a force. They have invested their re-
sources in developing an economic re-
lationship with these countries, have 
provided them with COVID–19 vaccines 
when others would not, and were be-
coming larger and larger factors in the 
future of the economies of these coun-
tries. 
Senator COONS said at one point, and 
I certainly would agree with him: We 
have to take this seriously in the 
United States. We can’t assume that 
long-term relationships and friendships 
will see us through. We need to be ac-
tively engaged in strengthening and 
creating alliances with these countries 
in our hemisphere. 
He added—and I am glad he did—the 
United States has chosen, over recent 
history, to literally spend trillions of 
dollars on military efforts and those 
overseas commitments, which is money 
China wasn’t spending for the same 
purpose. China was spending trillions 
of dollars to develop economic rela-
tionships, to loan money for infrastruc-
ture projects in developing countries. 
The United States was spending its 
money in other places, which takes me 
directly to the statement that was 
made earlier by the Republican Senate 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, about Af-
ghanistan. You see, I was here on the 
floor of the Senate when we voted to 
invade Afghanistan, and I voted for it. 
We were told that al-Qaida was waiting 
there in hiding for the next oppor-
tunity to strike America and that if we 
didn’t do our part to go after Osama 
bin Laden, there would be more Amer-
ican 
innocent 
victims. 
Overwhelm-
ingly, on a bipartisan vote, a unani-
mous bipartisan vote, in the Senate 
Chamber, we voted to invade Afghani-
stan, and I was one of those votes. 
Let me quickly add that I was one of 
23 who voted against the invasion of 
Iraq. I didn’t think the case had been 
made by the Bush administration and 
still don’t. 
But going into Afghanistan was, with 
the exception of one Member of the 
House, a unanimous bipartisan verdict 
at that moment in American history. 
As we look back on it now, I don’t 
think a single person who voted for the 
invasion of Afghanistan would have 
ever guessed that we were voting for 
the longest war in the history of the 
United States. Yes, that is what it 
turned out to be—over 20 years in the 
war in Afghanistan. 
Well, decisions have been made to 
change that, and they were not made 
by President Biden alone. They were 
first made by President Trump. If you 
will remember correctly, he was nego-
tiating with the Taliban for an exit 
strategy, a timetable, to leave Afghani-
stan, and they were reaching agree-
ment on that fact. The Senator from 
Kentucky didn’t dwell on that fact, but 
it is an important one. The decision 
had been made by the Republican ad-
ministration to leave. Biden inherited 
it and accepted it, and he has been 
going forward with that. 
Keep in mind, we are not leaving 
without an effort. It is a supreme effort 
for more than 2,000 Americans who lost 
their lives in that effort in Afghanistan 
and more than $1 trillion—much more 
than $1 trillion—being spent in dedica-
tion to that effort over the years. So 
after all that effort, it was clear this 
long-term war was going to be longer 
still, and the Senator from Kentucky 
came to the floor today with the plea 
that we should have continued that 
war in Afghanistan—to what end and 
on what timetable, I have no idea. 
But it is interesting when he men-
tions the fact that there were Afghan 
citizens helping the United States who 
were not being treated properly. You 
see, Senator LEAHY, the Democratic 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, has an emergency security 
supplemental bill, which he is trying to 
move quickly. It has already passed the 
House. It pays for the expenses of Jan-
uary 6 and the mob that invaded the 
Capitol after being inspired by Presi-
dent Trump. But it does more than 
that. It provides resources for those Af-
ghans who did help us in that war to 
protect them. 
I would vote for that in a second, but 
that emergency supplemental has been 
bogged down by the Republican side of 
the aisle. And then the Republican 
leader comes and says we are not doing 
enough for the refugees. I commend to 
him to read the Leahy supplemental 
appropriations. Resources are there for 
those same refugees. And I support 
that, he should support that and should 
instruct the Republican leader on the 
Appropriations Committee to join in 
the effort. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, the second issue the 
Republican leader raised this morning 
is worthy of note. When we passed 
emergency supplemental bills in 2020 in 
the midst of the pandemic crisis, and 
the 
Trump 
administration 
was 
in 
charge, they were bipartisan in nature. 
I was happy to support them. We were 
facing an American national public 
health crisis. Our economy was suf-
fering gravely, families and workers 
the same. 
Democrats joined with Republicans 
during the Trump years to provide re-
sources to businesses and individuals 
across America to get through that 
terrible time. I am glad we did it. That 
is the kind of bipartisanship people ex-
pect. 
So now what happens when President 
Biden arrives on the scene and comes 
up with an American Rescue Plan? Not 
one Republican Senator, not one Re-
publican Congressman would vote for 
the American Rescue Plan. And Sen-
ator MCCONNELL
this morning ex-
plained why: Because it was filled with 
what he called ‘‘socialist ideas.’’ 
Let’s take a look at the Biden Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, just rife with social-
ism. Let me tell you what Senator 
MCCONNELL
is including: billions of 
dollars 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
COVID–19 vaccines across the United 
States. No, President Trump didn’t 
leave office with a plan for that to hap-
pen. President Biden had to create it in 
the American Rescue Plan. Is that so-
cialism—to provide vaccines for mil-
lions of Americans to protect them 
against COVID–19? Apparently Senator 
MCCONNELL thinks it was. 
And here is another one of his con-
demned 
socialist 
ideas: 
providing 
money to businesses to reopen and hire 
employees back. That is socialism? I 
don’t think so. That is part of restoring 
a market economy that was badly dam-
aged by COVID–19. 
The list goes on—money that was 
given through the American Rescue 
Plan, without a single Republican vote, 
to help units of government that had 
lost 
so 
much 
revenue 
because 
of 
COVID–19 restore essential services. 
President Biden has said that among 
those services is protection on the 
street, funding law enforcement—re-
sponsible law enforcement—to stop the 
killing. Well, I want to tell you that I 
am glad that he said that. It is not so-
cialism in the city of Chicago, where 
on the Fourth of July weekend 104 peo-
ple were shot—104 people were shot in 
Chicago, 19 killed, including 2 police of-
ficers who were shot, I might add. And 
the President said we should take the 
resources from the American Rescue 
Plan and dedicate them to restoring 
order in neighborhoods across America. 
My city of Chicago is not an excep-
tion, sadly. It is a pattern that is show-
ing up in cities across America, large 
and small. So these American rescue 
funds for that purpose, far from social-
ism, are really basic to what we expect 
in this country. 
I know that the Senator from Ken-
tucky returned to the Commonwealth 
over the break. He did an interesting 
dance, saying that he was glad that 
money was coming into Kentucky, but 
he didn’t vote for it. We have heard 
that from Republicans across the Na-
tion. 
I wish they would have voted for it. 
Wouldn’t it have been nice if Biden— 
President Biden—had enjoyed the same 
level of bipartisan support that we 
gave to President Trump on the Demo-
cratic side in the midst of this pan-
demic crisis? Maybe it is too much to 
ask from the minority leader, who has 
publicly announced that he is 100 per-
cent opposed to the Biden agenda—not 
a very constructive approach.

S4839 
July 13, 2021 
CAPITOL FENCING AND JANUARY 6 
Mr. President, I want to speak on a 
different topic at this point, Mr. Presi-
dent. As I walked into the Capitol, I 
took a look around and saw something 
that I have been waiting for. Families 
were walking across the parking lot 
right in front of the Capitol, enjoying 
themselves. Children were out in the 
grass running around. People were 
crowding together to snap selfies. That 
used to be so routine around here, but 
since January 6, it has not been the 
case. 
Behind all of these families visiting 
their Nation’s Capitol Building was 
this beautiful dome of the Capitol—ma-
jestic, unobstructed for the first time 
in 6 months. 
Over the weekend, Capitol workers 
removed the remaining metal fencing 
and concrete barriers that have sur-
rounded this building since the mob at-
tack on January 6. My special thanks 
to those workers. 
That security fencing stood as a re-
minder of what happened on January 6 
when former President Donald Trump 
summoned and agitated a mob to 
Washington and then sent them on a 
mission to storm the heart of democ-
racy. 
Well, Trump is gone. But our democ-
racy is still here. And the smiling faces 
outside the Capitol this week are a tes-
tament to the resilience that many 
Americans share today. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
helping 
to 
unite 
this 
Nation. 
He 
brought us together by appealing to 
our shared values and our shared iden-
tity. His steady, nonconfrontational 
approach has been a breath of fresh air 
after the stifling storm of hateful, divi-
sive tweets of the Trump years. 
His 
leadership—President 
Biden’s 
leadership—has allowed us to reopen 
this Capitol. So every American, and 
every visitor to the people’s house, can 
experience this historic value. 
But even as we celebrate the walls 
around our Capitol coming down, it is 
important to recognize that there are 
still many unanswered questions about 
January 6. Our Nation suffered a dead-
ly, shameful, infamous—infamous—se-
curity breach on January 6. You would 
think that every Member of the Senate 
would be demanding to know what was 
behind it, what caused it, and to find a 
way to make certain it never happens 
again, especially since it left 140 Cap-
itol Police officers and other law en-
forcement officers injured and 1 dead. 
Sadly, most Republican lawmakers 
actively 
oppose 
investigating 
what 
happened on January 6. Even worse, 
some of them are whitewashing the 
events. Republican lawmakers in the 
House have called the insurrectionists 
patriots. Patriots? Have you seen the 
video? Those were patriots marching 
through these halls with Confederate 
flags, Trump flags? 
One House Member, who helped barri-
cade the House doors to protect himself 
from this mob, now calls the insurrec-
tionists ‘‘a normal tourist visit.’’ Get 
out of here. 
Appallingly, the former President, 
Donald Trump, last week threatened— 
now, listen to this—he is going to share 
sensitive, personal information about 
the officers who defended Members of 
Congress from an insurrectionist who 
attempted to storm the Speaker’s 
Lobby. 
These despicable efforts to rewrite 
the events of January 6, to somehow li-
onize the terrorists who participated in 
it and denigrate those who defended us, 
are nothing short of disgusting—and a 
second assault on our democracy. 
It is a slap in the face of every officer 
who protected this building from a 
murderous mob. Our officers deserve 
answers for what happened that day, 
and they deserve to know who is re-
sponsible for it. 
More than 535 people have already 
been arrested for their involvement in 
that insurrection—and many of them 
have ties to White supremacists and 
domestic terrorist organizations. How 
did these far-right, fringe groups plan 
their attack on our democracy? Who 
helped them? Who funded their effort? 
Who planted pipe bombs outside the 
headquarters of both political parties? 
What contacts, if any, did Members of 
Congress have with these insurrection-
ists in the days leading up to the at-
tack? 
We don’t have a full accounting. Yet, 
last month, Republican Senators fili-
bustered the creation of an inde-
pendent, bipartisan commission to in-
vestigate the January 6 insurrection. 
Senator MCCONNELL pleaded with his 
caucus to block this commission. 
Well, Congressional Democrats are 
determined to give the officers who de-
fended this Capitol and the American 
people the truth about January 6. We 
are not going to tolerate whitewashing 
this attack for political purposes. 
I strongly support Speaker PELOSI’s 
decision to form a bipartisan select 
committee to investigate it, and I look 
forward to its findings. And as the 
House moves forward with its own in-
vestigation, we need to ask ourselves 
why the Republican Senate leader and 
all but six Republican Senators voted 
to prevent the Senate from doing its 
part to uncover the truth about this as-
sault on our Capitol. 
Not only does the Republican leader 
oppose efforts to investigate what hap-
pened on January 6, he is leading the 
effort against the funding needed to en-
sure it doesn’t happen again. House and 
Senate Democrats have put forward 
good-faith proposals to provide emer-
gency funding to deal with the ongoing 
security issues at the Capitol and give 
the Capitol Police and staff here the re-
sources they need to do their job. 
If this Senate fails to approve that 
supplemental 
funding 
package, 
the 
Capitol Police department may have to 
start furloughing dozens—maybe hun-
dreds—of officers at the end of this 
month. 
Let me be clear. No one—no one—has 
paid a heavier price for the insurrec-
tion than our Capitol Police Force. 
They will carry the trauma of January 
6 with them for the rest of their lives. 
These officers work day and night to 
keep us safe and to secure the Capitol 
Complex for the American people who 
visit. The least we can do is to make 
sure they receive their paychecks. 
Yesterday, Senator PATRICK LEAHY 
introduced an updated version of the 
supplemental package for security. It 
would fully pay our Capitol Police offi-
cers’ salaries and provide additional 
funding to secure the Capitol Complex. 
It would also provide much-needed 
funding to deal with the impacts of the 
pandemic on the Capitol. 
Over the last year, both the pan-
demic and insurrection put a huge fi-
nancial strain on this institution. 
Keeping the Capitol and the people who 
work here in a safe situation is a new 
environment that will cost money. 
So far, Republican colleagues have 
been unwilling to face the reality that 
we find ourselves in today and to spend 
the money needed to respond to the 
real threats we are facing. Their pro-
posal falls short of the needs of the mo-
ment. Senator LEAHY’s proposal will 
address the issues facing the Capitol 
Complex. 
And don’t we owe it to the men and 
women who protect us and our staff 
and our visitors to support their impor-
tant work and pass this bill? 
When a filibuster prevents the Senate 
from even investigating an attack on 
the Senate itself and another filibuster 
may be used to threaten paying our po-
lice officers who protect us, we have to 
ask a basic question: Who really bene-
fits from the misuse of a filibuster? 
Does the current overuse and misuse of 
this filibuster benefit our democracy? 
Absolutely not. 
The Republican leader has used the 
filibuster in a way never seen in the 
history of the Senate to prevent us 
from even starting debate on legisla-
tion that would make it easier for 
Americans to vote. 
You know that, Mr. President, better 
than anyone because your State of 
Georgia is going through that debate 
at this very moment. 
Does the filibuster in its current 
form actually benefit America? How 
could it? Last month, Senator MCCON-
NELL used the filibuster to block this 
body from taking up equal pay legisla-
tion, preventing employers from dis-
criminating against women in the 
workplace. It is one of the many poli-
cies supported by a broad majority of 
American people of both political par-
ties. Unfortunately, those ideas—as 
good as they are, as popular as they 
are, as needed as they are—are dead on 
arrival in the Senate thanks to Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and his filibuster. 
So again, I ask: What benefits do we 
derive from grinding our government 
to a halt? It is a small club that bene-
fits. You know who is in it? The 
wealthiest individuals and the richest 
corporations. The elites are the only 
people who benefit from our broken po-
litical system. It stops progress alto-
gether.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4840 
July 13, 2021 
The Framers of the Constitution 
never intended for one-half of one 
branch of government to be equipped 
with a kill switch that any Senator can 
push to avoid honest debate. The fili-
buster as it is used today doesn’t pro-
mote bipartisanship. It is preventing 
bipartisan progress. 
As I said, the proposal to form an 
independent commission to investigate 
the January 6 insurrection had broad, 
bipartisan support in the Senate. Six 
Republican colleagues had the courage 
to stand up and join all of the Demo-
crats in calling for this January 6 com-
mission. But a minority of Senators— 
all Republican—refused. This is not 
how our legislative process is supposed 
to function. 
Our Nation’s Founders wanted to 
give each Senator a voice, not a veto 
over every piece of legislation. That is 
how the filibuster is being misused 
today. 
So as we celebrate the reopening of 
the Capitol grounds, let’s take a mo-
ment to appreciate the fact our democ-
racy has survived, but it cannot pro-
tect itself from future attacks. That 
responsibility falls on our shoulders. 
No wasting time on delay tactics; it is 
time to do the work that we were sent 
to Washington to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
The Republican whip. 
ABORTION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
month, Speaker PELOSI was asked if 
she thought a 15-week-old unborn baby 
was a human being. She declined to an-
swer. A few days later, the President’s 
Press Secretary was asked if the Presi-
dent thinks a 15-week-old unborn baby 
is a human being. She also declined to 
answer. 
In case the President and the Speak-
er are in any doubt, let me just clear 
things up for them. A 15-week-old un-
born baby is a human being. That baby 
has a human mom and a human dad, 
and human beings have other human 
beings. That is not a complex moral or 
philosophical question. That is biology 
101. 
Of course, I am pretty sure the rea-
son the Speaker and the President’s 
Press Secretary declined to answer 
these questions is not because they are 
confused about the answer. I don’t 
think there is anybody out there who 
isn’t aware on some level that unborn 
human beings are human beings. The 
moment of birth does not magically 
confer humanity. 
No, the Speaker and the President 
don’t want to admit that unborn chil-
dren are human beings because admit-
ting it would make it hard to defend 
the fact that they support the right to 
kill these babies. If you support abor-
tion, it is much easier to pretend an 
unborn baby is just a clump of cells 
rather than a separate human being 
with his or her own fingerprints and 
DNA. It is a lot easier to defend killing 
that baby if you pretend that baby is 
just a part of the mother instead of a 
unique, separate, unrepeatable indi-
vidual. 
That is why the Speaker of the U.S. 
House of Representatives and the Press 
Secretary for the President of the 
United States have declined to answer 
a question any 10-year-old could an-
swer: whether the baby inside his or 
her mom is a human being. 
At the end of May, President Biden 
released his budget. It was a slap in the 
face to pro-life Americans. The Presi-
dent’s budget abandons decades of bi-
partisan compromise and calls for the 
elimination of the Hyde amendment, 
which protects taxpayers from having 
their tax dollars go to fund abortions. 
And that is not all. The budget con-
tains a whole host of pro-abortion 
measures that would, among other 
things, direct taxpayer dollars to fund 
abortion providers here at home and 
overseas. 
This isn’t just some theatrical pro-
posal. Democrats in the House of Rep-
resentatives have already acted in 
committee to exclude the Hyde amend-
ment and other pro-life measures from 
appropriations bills. If we can’t agree 
that unborn human beings deserve to 
have their human rights protected, we 
should at least be able to agree that 
taxpayers should not be forced to fund 
the killing of unborn persons. 
The American people don’t think tax-
payers should fund abortions. In fact, 
nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose 
taxpayer funding of abortions. The 
President himself has, as recently as 
his Presidential campaign, supported 
the Hyde amendment, but there is one 
interest group that controls the Demo-
cratic Party. It is the abortion indus-
try and its supporters, and I guess the 
President figured that he needed to 
sacrifice his support for the Hyde 
amendment if he wanted to win the 
election. 
And now Democrats and the Presi-
dent are following through by attempt-
ing to force taxpayers to pay for abor-
tions. To hear Democrats talk, you 
would think abortion on demand, with-
out limits, up until the moment of 
birth, was the standard position of this 
country and the world. But it is actu-
ally not. The United States is one of 
only a tiny handful of countries in the 
world—in the entire world—that allow 
elective abortions past 20 weeks of 
pregnancy. 
Americans are squarely to the right 
of the Democratic Party on abortion. A 
strong majority of Americans believe 
abortion should be illegal or there 
should at least be some restrictions on 
abortion, and that has been the posi-
tion of the American people for a long 
time. 
Despite the Democrats’ best efforts, 
Americans still aren’t convinced un-
limited abortion on demand should be 
the law of the land. It is really not sur-
prising. No one who has ever heard the 
thump, thump, thump of an unborn 
baby’s heartbeat really thinks that we 
are just talking about a clump of cells. 
No one who has ever looked at an 
ultrasound screen and seen an unborn 
baby waving her hands or kicking her 
feet is in any doubt that that baby is a 
human being. 
And at some level, every person 
knows that human beings have human 
rights and that human beings deserve 
to be protected, even when they are 
small and weak and vulnerable—espe-
cially when they are small and weak 
and vulnerable. 
No matter how hard the abortion 
lobby pushes, they can’t convince the 
majority of Americans that abortion is 
an unqualified good. Unfortunately, 
however, they succeeded in turning the 
Democratic Party into their legislative 
arm. And President Biden and Demo-
crats in Congress are obediently pur-
suing a radical abortion agenda that 
puts them squarely to the left of the 
majority of the American people. 
It is not limited to taxpayer funding 
of 
abortion 
or 
abortion 
providers. 
President Biden nominated a radical 
pro-abortion crusader as the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services. In May, 
Secretary Becerra appeared before a 
House subcommittee where he chose to 
answer a question on Federal abortion 
law by indulging in a game of seman-
tics. Not only did he fail to commit to 
enforcing the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, he refused to even acknowl-
edge its existence, even though he 
voted against the law repeatedly dur-
ing his time in the House of Represent-
atives. 
Then there is the so-called Equality 
Act—Democrats’ 
unprecedented 
as-
sault on free speech and religious lib-
erty that would also erode conscience 
protections on abortions as well as re-
strictions on Federal funding. Under 
the Equality Act, doctors and nurses 
who have a moral objection to partici-
pating in abortions could be forced to 
participate or lose their jobs. 
I haven’t even mentioned the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, sponsored 
by almost every Democrat in the Sen-
ate, which would threaten even the 
mildest State limits on abortion. 
It is deeply disheartening that mak-
ing sure unborn children are deprived 
of their human rights has become a de-
fining cause for one of the two major 
parties in this country. We can do bet-
ter than this. We have to do better 
than this. 
Congressman Henry Hyde, for whom 
the Hyde amendment was named, once 
noted that abortion—which, as he said, 
denies ‘‘an entire class of human beings 
the welcome and protection of our 
laws’’—is a betrayal of ‘‘the best in our 
tradition.’’ 
And he was right. What kind of a 
message does it send to our children

when we tell them that an entire class 
of human beings is not worthy of pro-
tection, when we deny human rights to 
the most innocent and vulnerable hu-
mans among us? We have to do better. 
To my Democratic colleagues, I 
would say, if we cannot act today to se-
cure justice and human rights for un-
born human beings, let’s at least stand 
for the great American tradition of 
freedom of conscience and protect the 
rights of doctors and nurses who de-
cline to participate in abortions. Let’s 
at least spare Americans who oppose 
the taking of innocent human life from 
having their tax dollars go to fund 
abortions. At the very, very least, we 
should be able to agree upon that. 
As I said, I am saddened and dis-
heartened that a major political party 
in this country made depriving unborn 
human rights as their defining cause, 
but their right to life will not be ig-
nored. 
While Democratic leaders may deny 
the humanity of the unborn, there are 
a lot of Americans out there—a lot of 
Americans—who recognize it. I have 
faith that sooner or later this country 
will live up to its founding promise and 
the best of its tradition and extend the 
protection of its laws to every human 
being, born and unborn. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
finish my remarks, roughly 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TEXAS LEGISLATURE 
Mr. CORNYN. Well, just when you 
think you have seen it all, Mr. Presi-
dent, something new happens here in 
Washington, DC. All eyes are now on 
DC’s newest asylum seekers, the mem-
bers of the Texas House of Representa-
tives, the Democratic Representatives. 
But the only oppressive force that 
these men and women are facing is the 
expectation that they would actually 
do their jobs in the Texas Legislature, 
the job they campaigned for and were 
elected to do. 
Following unsuccessful attempts to 
pass an election integrity bill during 
the regular legislative session earlier 
this year, Governor Abbott has now 
called a special session for the Texas 
Legislature to consider that and other 
matters. That special session kicked 
off last Thursday, but the chamber is 
already being held hostage by a minor-
ity of house members who are unwill-
ing to do their job. The Democrats 
raised concerns about the current draft 
of the bill. Make no mistake. That is 
why the legislative process actually ex-
ists. That is why it is important that 
they be there and debate the issues and 
actually vote on the bill. The purpose, 
of course, is for all sides to be able to 
debate, potentially amend, and vote on 
legislation. 
Yet, rather than do their jobs in 
Texas, yesterday, house Democrats 
abandoned both our State and the mil-
lions of Texans whom they represent 
and decamped to Washington, DC, 
when they were faced with the prospect 
of defeat. For better or for worse, the 
legislative process is all about arith-
metic. You are not always going to win 
every debate you are involved in. That 
doesn’t mean you leave the State and 
refuse to do your job, but that is ex-
actly what they did. They got on two 
chartered jets—maskless and with at 
least one case of light beer—to come to 
Washington, DC. 
The problem—and, really, what is so 
sad—is I don’t think these legislators 
realize the irony of the situation. They 
are using their collective power as the 
minority party to stop a bill they op-
pose from becoming law. While doing 
so, they have come to Washington to 
try to convince the President and Sen-
ate Democrats to nuke the very Senate 
rule that protects the rights of the mi-
nority—in other words, you might say, 
a filibuster for me but not for thee. As 
a reminder, this is the second time 
they have denied the legislature a 
quorum this year. 
I think it is pretty obvious that this 
was nothing more than a political 
stunt when these lawmakers skipped 
town with no plan as to when they 
would return to their jobs in Texas. 
Frankly, 
the 
Governor, 
under 
the 
Texas Constitution, can continue to 
call as many special sessions as he 
wishes and without limitation. So we 
all know how this will end. They will 
eventually go home. After the cameras 
leave and after the press loses interest 
in this political stunt, they will go 
home, and they will participate in the 
process. 
It is telling that these Democrats in 
this house of representatives chose to 
race toward TV cameras in Washington 
rather than present their arguments in 
the legislature, and it is not without 
some risk to them. I am advised that 
they were on Federal property and re-
ferred to a website, which was actually 
a fundraising site, for their efforts. We 
all know there are limits—in fact, 
strict limits—on any fundraising on 
Federal property. So they may have 
crossed a line, unwittingly or not. 
This is simply an embarrassing dere-
liction of their duty and a shameful po-
litical stunt, as I said. They can’t win. 
So they are doing the equivalent of ‘‘I 
will take my ball and go home’’ or, in 
this case, ‘‘I am simply running away.’’ 
Texans standing up to a fight is part of 
who we are, even if you know, in the 
end, you may not prevail. Instead, they 
turned their backs, hopped on a private 
jet, and ran from this fight. 
Like our Democratic colleagues in 
Congress, Texas State lawmakers have 
tried to create a false choice between 
voter access and election security. I 
think it boils down to this: We should 
be making it easier to vote and tougher 
to cheat, plain and simple. It is dis-
ingenuous and downright false to claim 
any effort to prevent fraud is a veiled 
attempt at voter suppression. We know 
that minority voters, voters of color, 
voted at unprecedented levels in the 
2020 election. 
In my State, we had 66 percent of 
registered voters vote and the highest 
levels in history of African-American 
and Hispanic voters—so much for this 
idea that, somehow, the people who 
want to be able to vote can’t vote even 
though we ordinarily have 2 weeks of 
early voting before the general elec-
tion. We have mail-in ballots for people 
who are disabled, who are over 65, or 
who cannot—or otherwise will not—be 
in town on election day. Of course, we 
have election day voting as well. In 
2020, we had 11.3 million Texans who 
cast their ballots—as I said, 66 percent 
of registered voters. The last time I 
was on the ballot, in 2014, we had 4.8 
million voters—4.8 to 11.3 in 6 years 
alone. So believe me—there is robust 
voter participation, and nothing the 
Texas Legislature is considering will 
deny people their legitimate right to 
vote and ability to cast their votes, 
and that is appropriate that they 
should do so. 
There are other additional items in 
the Governor’s call for this special ses-
sion, including things like bail reform 
and family violence prevention. Of 
course, by fleeing town and coming to 
Washington in this political stunt, the 
Democratic house members are abdi-
cating their responsibility to deal with 
these other issues as well. It is not just 
about election law reform; it is about 
these other issues like bail reform and 
family violence prevention. 
I believe firmly and am confident I 
am in the majority of my constituents, 
of my 29 million constituents, that 
they actually expect us, when we run 
for office and when we get elected, to 
show up for our jobs and not take part 
in a highly orchestrated and ethically 
dubious act of political theater. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
rise in strong support of the nomina-
tion of Julie Su to be Deputy Secretary 
of the Department of Labor. 
The U.S. Department of Labor is an 
important Federal Agency, but amidst 
a global pandemic that has left mil-
lions of Americans out of work, the De-
partment’s mission takes on outsized 
importance. The Department needs 
leadership 
with 
deep 
experience, 
knowledge, and a demonstrated ability 
to successfully lead an organization. 
Just as importantly, the Department 
needs leadership with an understanding 
of the unique challenges of this mo-
ment. As we are seeing with President 
Biden, leadership does make a dif-
ference. At this critical time in our Na-
tion’s economic recovery, we must en-
sure the President has the team he 
needs to move our country forward. 
Julie Su is a key member of that team. 
She is a highly qualified and proven 
leader. 
As California’s secretary of labor and 
workforce development, Secretary Su 
oversees and protects the workforce for 
the State of California, the fifth larg-
est economy in the world. When you 
add her work as an attorney and a non-
profit executive, she brings a wide mix 
of experience to the table. Coupled 
with a collaborative work style that 
gives everyone a seat at the table, Sec-
retary Su has not only delivered on her 
agency’s mission but has also improved 
and transformed her agency. 
Her success and effectiveness is best 
summed up in the words of her own 
staff at the agency she has led for more 
than 7 years: 
During Ms. Su’s seven years as California 
Labor Commissioner, she remade the agency 
in ways that many would have thought im-
possible. 
She increased efficiency throughout the di-
vision and broke down departmental silos 
that had stifled effective collaboration and 
caused redundancy. 
Moreover, under her leadership, the Labor 
Commissioner’s office reworked its inves-
tigative bureau into a cutting edge labor en-
forcement team that dug deep into complex 
cases that the Labor Commissioner’s office 
had been previously unequipped to handle. 
Complex, high quality investigations that 
had previously been rare—if not unthink-
able—became standard operating procedure. 
Secretary Su is an excellent man-
ager. Not only does she deliver results, 
she invests in her own staff by pro-
viding them with the resources and en-
vironment they need to get the job 
done. She builds diverse teams and 
then empowers them to do their best 
work—all while knowing who they are. 
I mean this literally. 
Again, in the words of her staff: 
She was legendary for having learned the 
names of every one of the more than 600 staff 
within the Labor Commissioner’s office, 
from secretarial support staff to investiga-
tors, deputies, and legal staff. 
Julie Su will also bring diverse life 
experiences to the Department. She is 
the daughter of Chinese immigrants. 
Her immigrant background shaped Sec-
retary 
Su 
personally 
and 
profes-
sionally. Her own lived experience of-
fered her insight into how segments of 
our economy leave people behind or 
even exclude them from experiencing 
the benefits of economic growth and 
opportunities. 
Her professional career reflects this 
life lesson as she has established a long 
and distinguished record of fighting for

worker rights and civil rights. From 
defending the rights of Thai garment 
workers to protecting low-wage work-
ers against abuses, Secretary Su has 
worked tirelessly to help people and 
communities that might not otherwise 
have access to justice. This sense of 
fairness and the desire to fight injus-
tice will be critical for the Department 
of Labor, particularly as the Depart-
ment works to address the pandemic’s 
disproportionate impact on women and 
minorities. 
Given her proven track record and 
commitment to worker and fair labor 
rights, I have every confidence that 
Secretary Su will protect all sectors of 
our workforce and will work to lift ev-
eryone from this pandemic. Moreover, 
her experience in managing labor pol-
icy at the executive level for the State 
of California over the last decade will 
enable Secretary Su to hit the ground 
running immediately after she is con-
firmed. 
In particular, through the COVID–19 
pandemic, Secretary Su has dealt with 
the overwhelming demand for assist-
ance from workers who are suffering or 
who are unemployed. She has helped 
her State combat the organized crime 
attacks and employment fraud that 
have affected all 50 States, including, 
of course, California, with its large 
economy. She has worked to address 
systemic shortcomings that bad actors 
have exploited during this pandemic. 
Secretary Su led an effort to stop 
fraudulent actors from taking advan-
tage of the unemployment system, dat-
ing back to the beginning of the pan-
demic, and the State of California has 
already begun prosecuting these of-
fenders. The U.S. Department of Labor 
ultimately advised all States to take 
the same steps Secretary Su took in 
order 
to 
cut 
down 
on 
fraudulent 
claims. 
Despite the many challenges brought 
on by the pandemic, Secretary Su has 
never lost sight of her ultimate goal: to 
provide millions of workers access to 
unemployment benefits and other as-
sistance. In these economic times, Sec-
retary Su’s leadership skills and prov-
en track record of experience and effec-
tiveness are just what we need. 
Her nomination also proves some-
thing I believe deeply: When you look 
for the most qualified person, you get 
diversity, and when you prioritize di-
versity, you get the most qualified peo-
ple—people who reflect all of America 
and who are able to serve all of Amer-
ica. 
Secretary Su’s nomination is sup-
ported by many who see their stories 
reflected in hers, including labor lead-
ers from the AFL–CIO and SEIU, busi-
ness leaders from the Small Business 
Majority, and civil rights leaders from 
the National Women’s Law Center and 
the National Employment Law Project. 
Secretary Su will be an outstanding 
Deputy Secretary of Labor. I am proud 
to support her nomination, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, to-
day’s workers are really struggling 
through one of the most unequal eco-
nomic crises in modern American his-
tory. With millions out of a job and 
millions more struggling to get by, it 
is clear that workers need a Deputy 
Secretary of Labor who is committed 
to building back a stronger, fairer 
economy. They need someone who will 
work diligently to make sure workers 
have a fair and just workplace, a liv-
able wage, a secure retirement, safe 
working conditions, access to accom-
modations, and are treated with dig-
nity and respect, which is why I am so 
glad to support Julie Su’s nomination. 
As a labor lawyer, Julie Su fought to 
defend Thai garment workers who were 
trafficked into the United States and 
forced to work behind barbed wire and 
under armed guard. Then she pushed to 
change the law to make sure corpora-
tions were held responsible for working 
conditions in their supply chains. 
As California labor commissioner, 
Julie Su cracked down on wage theft 
and launched a multilingual campaign 
to help workers understand their rights 
and feel safe about speaking up about 
employers who stole their wages. 
As California’s secretary of labor, 
Julie Su has implemented increases to 
the State minimum wage, created 
good-paying, 
high-quality 
jobs, 
ex-
panded access to benefits for gig work-
ers and workers who are paid low 
wages, and protected essential workers 
who are bearing the brunt of this pan-
demic. 
It is clear that her experience in 
leading one of the largest State labor 
departments in the Nation, her dec-
ades-long commitment to fighting for 
workers’ rights, and her personal story 
as the multilingual daughter of Chi-
nese immigrants have given her the ex-
perience, background, and values to be 
a 
successful 
Deputy 
Secretary 
of 
Labor. 
She is the right person for the job, 
and I urge our colleagues to join me in 
voting to confirm her because, right 
now, too many workers still lack cru-
cial protections and rights and struggle 
to make ends meet, especially women, 
workers of color, LGBTQ workers, mi-
grant workers, and workers with dis-
abilities. 
To build back an economy that 
works for everyone, not just the big-
gest corporations and wealthiest indi-
viduals, it is critical that we have a 
fully staffed Department of Labor and 
leaders who are committed to pro-
tecting workers. So it is critical that 
we confirm Julie Su as Deputy Sec-
retary of Labor without delay. 
I yield the floor.

July 13, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
TRIBUTE TO ZAILA AVANT-GARDE 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
am here to talk about two things. 
First, let me give a heartfelt con-
gratulations to Zaila Avant-garde, this 
incredible—if we can get the poster 
up—14-year-old young lady, who just 
won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. 
She is Louisiana’s first winner and is 
the first African-American winner of 
this spelling bee. She dominated, get-
ting words that I don’t think any of the 
rest of us would have been able to spell. 
By the way, I should also note that 
she holds a Guinness World Record for 
dribbling. I am told there is a YouTube 
video of her dribbling and, at the same 
time, juggling basketballs that is in-
credible to watch. 
She has a bright future. Zaila shows 
that hard work and dedication bring 
success. 
This week, Senator JOHN KENNEDY 
and I introduced a resolution congratu-
lating Zaila. And Zaila, if you are 
watching, if you want to do it, when 
you are a little bit older and you want 
to do an internship in a Senate office 
in the U.S. Senate, please give me a 
call. Believe me, I will remember you. 
And if you wish to do that internship, 
we are here to encourage you as you 
embark on the rest of your life, a life 
that is going to be incredibly success-
ful. 
ENERGY POLICY 
Madam President, we have to talk 
about the White House’s hypocritical 
and backward energy policy that is 
putting a target on American workers. 
The Biden administration is happy to 
cancel U.S. pipelines and kill the jobs 
pipelines create, putting people in Lou-
isiana and elsewhere in the Nation out 
of business, justifying it by saying this 
is how we lower greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Yet they then greenlight a Rus-
sian pipeline into Germany when the 
emissions that come from Russian gas 
far exceed the emission profile of gas 
that is produced in Louisiana or else-
where in our country. By the way, it 
also creates Russian jobs while simul-
taneously we are killing American 
jobs. 
Then let’s look at gas prices, which 
are now much higher than they were. 
The Biden administration is working 
to put a pause on oil and gas produc-
tion in the Gulf of Mexico, but they are 
pleading with OPEC to increase OPEC 
production, saying we need more oil 
shipped to the United States to lower 
gas prices. 
Just last week, the President’s Press 
Secretary said the administration is 
encouraging OPEC countries to reach 
agreements 
to 
increase 
production 
while they are simultaneously sty-
mieing U.S. production and the U.S. 
jobs that go along with the production 
of U.S. oil and gas. 
And it just begs the question: The ad-
ministration is helping Russians and 
the Russian economy; they are helping 
OPEC nations and workers in OPEC; 
why don’t we think about helping 
American workers? It just cannot be 
understood. 
I am demanding; we are demanding; 
we are pleading not with OPEC but 
with the administration to leave our 
jobs and the livelihoods of Louisiana 
workers and American workers alone. 
Let’s just speak about the Louisiana 
industry. The oil and gas industry in 
Louisiana is a major economic and in-
dustrial force, a force for good, and the 
benefits from the environmental per-
spective must be stated. The United 
States is a global leader in decreasing 
greenhouse gas emissions, and this 
happened because of increased produc-
tion of U.S. natural gas. We simulta-
neously became a net exporter of en-
ergy, helping other nations lower their 
emission profile as well. But what we 
have seen in the last few months, you 
would not understand that. 
As I mentioned earlier, President 
Biden canceled the Keystone XL Pipe-
line and 11,000 jobs with it, but, again, 
Russian pipelines are OK. The adminis-
tration removed sanctions from Russia, 
clearing the way for the construction 
of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline—ce-
menting, by the way, Europe’s reliance 
upon Russian gas. Again, Russian gas, 
the production of it, emits far more 
greenhouse gas emissions than the pro-
duction of American and Louisiana 
natural gas. 
It is almost, if you will, a quadruple 
whammy: weakening U.S. security, in-
creasing global greenhouse gas emis-
sions, increasing gas prices, and killing 
American jobs. That is what this ad-
ministration’s 
policies 
have 
been 
doing. It begs the question: Why don’t 
we green-light U.S. pipelines as op-
posed to green-lighting Russian pipe-
lines? 
Americans across the country, every 
time they fill up their tanks, feel these 
punches, and they are tired of it. The 
average price of gasoline has now been 
over $3 a gallon since May, clocking in 
at $3.15 as of today, and it is only going 
up—expected that gas prices will rise 
another 10 to 20 cents through the end 
of August. Louisiana is a bit luckier. 
Because of our position as an energy 
powerhouse, the gas prices here at 
home are still averaging about $2.75— 
not going down anytime soon. 
While the administration is actively 
trying to kill domestic energy jobs, 
they are working to increase produc-
tion of oil overseas—again, asking the 
OPEC cartel to increase production so 
there is more oil to lower gas prices. 
Why don’t we just produce more oil in 
the United States of America? 
The administration says that they 
are killing jobs in the United States 
because of carbon emissions, but when 
you produce oil and gas in the Gulf of 
Mexico and you bring it to our shores, 
it has the lowest emissions profile of 
any oil and gas that we use in our 
country. You almost have to ask, what 
is it about the U.S. oil and gas worker 
that the administration doesn’t like? 
In 2019—just speaking about Lou-
isiana—in 2019, oil and gas operations 
supported nearly 250,000 Louisiana jobs, 
about 1 out of every 9 jobs in my State. 
The oil and gas industry provided $73 
billion to the State’s gross domestic 
product, more than a quarter. Through 
taxes alone, it accounted for $4.5 bil-
lion going directly to coastal restora-
tion, 
environmental 
improvement 
projects, 
schools, 
infrastructures, 
roads—you name it—making life better 
for the citizens of my State. 
It has been only 6 months of the 
Biden administration, but every day, 
that target on the back of an oil and 
gas worker and on their family’s future 
gets bigger and bigger and bigger. 
One more time, let me say in conclu-
sion, the Biden administration’s work-
ing against U.S. oil and gas production 
is making other countries stronger; it 
is making us weaker. It weakens Amer-
ica’s 
security, 
it 
increases 
global 
greenhouse gas emissions, it increases 
gas prices, and it kills jobs. We need 
better policy for our country, for my 
State, and for our workers. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
CUBA 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
would like to speak about a topic I 
spoke about before, and that is our pol-
icy toward Cuba. I couldn’t help but 
think, as I look at the Cubans pro-
testing in the street, especially as I see 
so many people in the streets in places 
where both my wife Marcelle and I 
have walked, and actually our grand-
daughter Sophia, where we know a 
number of the people there, and we see 
them protesting, it hits twice as hard. 
They are demanding greater freedom 
and economic opportunity. This illus-
trates a widespread hardship and hun-
ger and the need for fundamental 
change in Cuba. 
Human rights are universal. Cuban 
people are no different from people 
anywhere in the world. They want to 
be able to speak freely. They don’t 
want fear of retribution. 
We have been told that the Biden ad-
ministration is conducting a review of 
the Trump administration’s policy. It 
is the Trump administration’s policy 
toward Cuba which is now in effect. 
There is nothing unusual about that re-
view. New administrations regularly 
conduct such reviews. But it is now 
mid-July, and the key question that 
needs to be answered is not very com-
plicated. 
It is axiomatic that we have profound 
disagreements with the Cuban Govern-
ment. They have held power since 1959. 
They have held power by outlawing op-
position political parties. Dissent is 
often punished with physical abuse and

imprisonment. 
The 
government’s 
crackdown on the recent protests, call-
ing the protesters counterrevolution-
aries and blaming the United States for 
Cuba’s ills, is predictable. They have 
blamed us for many years. 
I look beyond the headlines. There is 
no doubt that the Cuban people, many 
of whom I have met, and I know they 
struggle from day to day to make ends 
meet—they want greater freedom, and 
they want a better life. They have told 
me that. They have told Marcelle. 
They have told the other Senators, Re-
publicans and Democrats, who have 
traveled there with me. But the ques-
tion now is, How should we respond? It 
comes down to whether you believe 
that we should continue a policy of 
unilateral sanctions, which have been 
in effect for decades, much of my life— 
they have completely failed to achieve 
their objectives, and they have contrib-
uted to the daily misery of Cuba’s peo-
ple—or should we instead pursue a pol-
icy of engagement? 
I believe President Obama got it 
right. You know, one definition of ‘‘in-
sanity’’ is to keep doing what has re-
peatedly and demonstrably failed. In 
Cuba, it is worse than that. Our policy, 
which does not work, has emboldened 
Cuba’s hardliners, and it provides an 
excuse for Cuba’s authorities to crack 
down on those who dare to protest. But 
worse than that, it has created a vacu-
um. And guess who is exploiting that 
vacuum a few miles from our shores? 
Well, of course, the Russians and the 
Chinese. And we undercut the Cuban 
private sector. 
By any objective measure, it is time 
for President Biden to act on his pledge 
to ‘‘reverse the failed Trump policies’’ 
that have ‘‘inflicted harm on Cubans 
and their families’’ and ‘‘done nothing 
to advance democracy and human 
rights.’’ 
I feel that if we allow those Trump 
sanctions to persist, we only under-
mine these principles. They restrict 
the freedom of movement and eco-
nomic autonomy of the Cuban people. 
They compound the suffering caused by 
the Cuban Government’s own repres-
sive policies and well-known economic 
mismanagement. In fact, the repres-
sion in Cuba didn’t decrease during the 
Trump administration; it increased. 
Biden administration officials have 
repeatedly said that democracy and 
human rights will be at the core of our 
policy toward Cuba. Well, I have been a 
defender of those principles for 50 
years, and human rights and political 
freedom should be a key element not 
just of our policy but also of our en-
gagement with Cuba. 
But, again, the question is how best 
to support the Cuban people who seek 
greater freedom and a better life. Is it 
to continue a policy that has achieved 
neither, which is likely to be used as 
an excuse by those in power to further 
stifle dissent? 
In fact, engagement with Cuba will 
honor 
our 
commitment 
to 
human 
rights and the recognition that Amer-
ican presence can be a positive force in 
closed societies. That is the argument 
that Secretary Blinken and others, 
both Democrats and Republicans, have 
rightly made in defense of diplomacy 
and engagement throughout the world. 
Neither engagement nor continu-
ation of the Trump sanctions can guar-
antee Cuba’s political transformation. 
That is ultimately a decision for the 
Cuban people. But—but—but engage-
ment stands a far greater chance of 
creating a new dynamic beneficial to 
the Cuban people. 
President Obama’s engagement with 
Cuba showed that U.S. travel, ex-
changes, remittances, and business ties 
expand opportunities and information 
and income for Cubans, boosting the 
private sector and increasing economic 
independence. 
I visited a number of these people, 
often young people starting their own 
businesses—small businesses, private 
businesses—doing it because of Presi-
dent Obama’s engagement with Cuba. 
It also initiated working-level discus-
sions on a wide range of issues, from 
law enforcement to property claims, to 
public health and environmental pro-
tection. 
Raul Castro and his generation are in 
the process of handing over power to 
the next generation. I compliment him 
on that. The current leadership is root-
ed in the past, but they are also deep in 
a debate about how to reform the econ-
omy, how to regulate the private sec-
tor, and how to navigate citizen de-
mands for pluralism, something they 
have not seen. I believe American citi-
zens and diplomats alike should par-
ticipate in that debate—and not from a 
distance, not from Washington and 
New York and elsewhere, but down 
there. 
Cuba’s private sector offers a par-
ticular opportunity because Cuba’s eco-
nomic policies are changing in ways 
that enable U.S. engagement to have 
greater impact than was impossible 
even during the Obama years. 
A new law will soon greatly expand 
the legal scope for private business ac-
tivity, and another is expected to give 
entrepreneurs legal status that will 
permit them to receive foreign invest-
ment. The government is enabling pri-
vate businesses to import supplies and 
export products. 
Any of us who come from States that 
have an agricultural industry should 
look at this. For the first time, the 
Cuban Government is calling for for-
eign investment in private farm co-
operatives. But for U.S. citizens and 
businesses to be able to engage, several 
steps are needed. 
We have to remove the restrictions 
that limit the flow of remittances, 
both family assistance and ‘‘donative’’ 
remittances mainly used to pay and 
support private entrepreneurs. 
Restore the travel regulations that 
were in effect when the Obama-Biden 
administration left office. This in-
cludes eliminating or significantly re-
ducing the Cuba Restricted List of 
business entities, ending the prohibi-
tion on lodging in Cuban hotels, and al-
lowing U.S. airlines to service provin-
cial airports. 
Reverse the frivolous ‘‘state sponsor 
of terrorism’’ designation that former 
Secretary Pompeo almost flippantly 
announced 9 days before leaving office. 
Suspend title III of the Helms-Burton 
Act, as all the Presidents did from 1996 
to 2019, Republican and Democratic 
Presidents alike. 
These regulatory changes would per-
mit the private sector to activate and 
would be no burden on the U.S. Govern-
ment. It would be the private sector ac-
tivating. 
We don’t need some grand diplomacy 
to do this. Dialogue with Cuba can re-
sume at the working level. Human 
rights advocacy at whatever level 
should be a key part of any engage-
ment policy, as it is in our relations 
with other autocratic governments. 
There would be broad support in this 
country for a return to engagement. 
There would be vocal support from U.S. 
agriculture, from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, from many Cuban Ameri-
cans, and from many in Cuba whose 
lives have become immeasurably worse 
due to the COVID pandemic. Given 
time to work, engagement policies 
would expand the constituency for en-
gagement in Miami as more Cuban 
Americans travel and build economic 
ties. 
This is also how you make progress 
with Cuba on cases of political pris-
oners or other violations of human 
rights. You don’t make this progress by 
making ultimatums or threats or re-
peating slogans that sound great but 
achieve nothing in practice. It can’t be 
by conditioning U.S. aid because we 
don’t gave aid to Cuba. We do to some 
military dictatorships, of course, like 
Egypt. It can’t be by canceling sales of 
U.S. weapons. We don’t sell weapons to 
Cuba the same way we do to some 
other 
repressive 
governments, 
like 
Saudi Arabia. It is through building re-
lations by making progress on issues 
where we share interests, which can 
create the conditions for progress— 
making progress on issues where we 
differ, like human rights and property 
claims. 
I don’t expect we are going to come 
down here and everybody is going to 
say: We all agree on everything. Let’s 
talk about the things where we do have 
differences. But you don’t talk about 
it—you don’t get anywhere by making 
ultimatums from a country away. 
I hope the Biden administration will 
be guided first and foremost by what is 
in our national interest but also in the 
interests of the Cuban and American 
people. Candidate Biden was right 
when he pledged, and I repeat, to ‘‘re-
verse the failed Trump policies’’ that 
have ‘‘inflicted harm on Cubans and 
their families’’ and ‘‘done nothing to 
enhance 
democracy 
and 
human 
rights.’’ 
It is time to act on that pledge. It is 
time to encourage so many of these

young people—young students, young 
entrepreneurs, young business owners 
like those I visited and met with in 
Cuba—it is time to say: Yes, you can be 
part of the world. Yes, you can work 
with those in our country who want to 
make your life better. If we do that, we 
will see the real change—not slogans of 
change but substantive change. 
I see my distinguished friend and col-
league from Ohio on the floor. I will 
ask to put my full statement in the 
RECORD. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague 
from Vermont, the President pro tem-
pore of the U.S. Senate. 
I was able to listen to some of his re-
marks regarding Cuba. This is a truly 
historic time in that island country. 
The demonstrations, I am told, are as 
large as they have been since at least 
1959. 
My hope is that the countries of the 
Americas, all of which I just visited— 
four of them down in Latin America— 
that believe in democracy, that believe 
in the ability for people to come to-
gether and gather and express their 
continues, 
that 
believe 
in 
strong 
human rights, would come together 
and support the Cuban people at this 
critical point. 
My understanding is, there are some 
opportunities to ensure that internet 
access continues among those dem-
onstrating. My understanding is that 
there are human rights abuses occur-
ring even now as we talk with regard 
to those demonstrators. 
I appreciate my colleague. He has 
spent a lot of time trying to take the 
Cuban relationship, which has been a 
fraught one, and make it better. My 
hope is that what we are seeing right 
now on the streets of Havana and else-
where around that country will lead to 
a better day for the people of Cuba. 
LATIN AMERICA CODEL 
Madam President, I did just return 
from a bipartisan trip to the area. I 
went with Senators TIM KAINE, JOHN 
HOEVEN, BEN RAY LUJA´ N, MIKE CRAPO, 
and CHRIS COONS to Mexico, Ecuador, 
Colombia, and Guatemala. 
I want to talk a bit about what we 
learned and a bit about some of the 
ways forward to help these countries 
and, frankly, to help ourselves here in 
America more by changing some of our 
policies—not 
just 
asking 
them 
to 
change what they do but changing 
some things we do. 
It was an opportunity to show our 
support for these countries. These are 
our neighbors in Latin America. All of 
them are allies. I understand this is the 
first major congressional delegation 
trip since the COVID–19 crisis began to 
abate, and we chose Latin America. 
They are our neighbors. They are at 
our front door, in fact. 
I did find when we were down there 
that there was a lot of appreciation for 
the fact that we were showing up and 
talking about America’s role in the re-
gion and, frankly, the role of China and 
even Russia and Iran and other coun-
tries—at least in the Venezuelan area 
with regard to Russia and Iran and 
Cuba. It has been increasing at a time 
when sometimes the U.S. presence is 
not felt as acutely. So it is important 
for us to be there as a country that is 
still a beacon of hope and opportunity 
for those who seek democracy and free-
dom and human rights. That is our 
role, in my view, is to continue to be 
that model but also to provide assist-
ance, more trade, to provide a way for 
these countries to be able to see more 
prosperity and peace themselves. So I 
thought it was an important trip and 
an important opportunity to be there. 
We had the opportunity to meet with 
the President of each of these four 
countries. In fact, none of our meetings 
with the respective Presidents went for 
less than 2 hours. These were very hon-
est dialogues. We got into some depth 
into the issues. 
We were able to discuss the COVID–19 
crisis. Each President was appreciative 
of the fact that the American taxpayer 
has helped to provide some vaccines to 
these countries. It is not everything 
they want, of course. They still need a 
lot more vaccines because their vac-
cine rates are far lower than ours. But 
each of these countries has suffered in 
terms of the impact of COVID–19, and 
each of these countries is eager to get 
back on their feet, to get the economy 
working again, to get their people back 
to work, back to school, back to a 
more normal life just like in this coun-
try. 
We talked about the surge of migra-
tion to the United States and the pres-
sure on our southern border but also 
here in America, in the interior, what 
is happening with regards to more and 
more migrants surging at the border. 
We are looking at 170,000, even 180,000 
per month now in the months of April, 
May, and June. So we do have to deal 
with that issue. 
Many of these countries are sending 
their young people and others to our 
borders. By the way, the Presidents of 
these countries all said the same thing. 
They want their people to stay in their 
country. They want their people to 
stay there to be part of the future of 
their country, to be able to help de-
velop the economy and the prosperity 
that they seek in their democracies. 
Sometimes that is not understood 
even by American policymakers, who 
think, with all great intentions—who 
are opening up more in the sense of 
providing a magnet, really, pulling 
people to the north. 
That treacherous journey north is 
also something that many of these 
Presidents commented on. Ecuador, as 
an example—you might not think of it 
as one of the countries that send a lot 
of migrants to the United States. You 
think of Honduras, El Salvador, Guate-
mala. My understanding is, they sur-
passed Honduras last month in the 
number of migrants they are sending 
to our border from Ecuador. They want 
those people to stay in Ecuador and be 
citizens there and help contribute to 
that country’s growth. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
impact 
with 
COVID–19 has made things more dif-
ficult in each of these countries. So 
their economies have been weakened 
just as ours was weakened. They were 
hit even harder and even longer, again, 
with the lack of vaccines. Again, we 
are helping them with that. I support 
that. I think it is very important. 
By the way, the Chinese are also sell-
ing a lot of vaccines throughout Latin 
America and trying very hard to influ-
ence what is going on in this part of 
the world, which is our hemisphere. 
The United States needs to be there for 
many reasons, and that is one. 
We also talked about the need for the 
continued battle against corruption in 
these countries and throughout Latin 
America and to ensure that you do 
have more transparency and a gov-
erning environment that is driven by 
the rule of law so there can be more in-
vestment from the United States and 
more trade between us. 
In Ecuador in particular, we talked 
about the need for a new trade agree-
ment, which I support, which would 
really help to strengthen our ties with 
Ecuador at a critical time in their his-
tory but also would be good economi-
cally for both countries’ mutual ben-
efit. 
With regard to Colombia, Guatemala, 
and, of course, Mexico, we have trade 
agreements, but we talked about how 
to improve those trade agreements— 
how they operate and are implemented 
on the ground. I am a former U.S. 
Trade Representative. I helped to nego-
tiate the Colombia trade agreement. I 
also helped with regard to the CAFTA 
agreement, which included Guatemala. 
Those agreements were helpful at the 
time. They could be even more helpful 
if they could be improved in certain re-
spects, 
and 
we 
talked 
specifically 
about that. 
Each President basically said the 
same thing: They would prefer trade to 
aid. They are not against U.S. assist-
ance. They appreciate it, and we do as-
sist those countries in a number of dif-
ferent ways. Yet what they really want 
is the ability to have more commerce, 
more U.S. investment, more jobs— 
therefore, more economic growth and 
more opportunities for their young 
people so they will stay in those coun-
tries. Continued support 
from 
the 
United States is crucial in all of these 
matters. 
With regard to COVID, we can supply 
more personal protective gear. They 
still need it. Certainly, the donations 
of vaccines have been very helpful. 
When we were in Guatemala, the Biden 
administration announced it was deliv-
ering 1.2 million doses of vaccines, ap-
proximately doubling the number of 
Guatemalans who can now be vac-
cinated. Now, I will tell you that is 
still only something like 10 or 12 per-
cent, so it is still relatively low. This is 
a first good step, and we need to try to

do more. As was the case in the United 
States, once these populations are vac-
cinated, they will be able to get their 
economies back on their feet. 
Our trip also allowed us to see first-
hand the problems associated with the 
surge of migration that has been play-
ing out on our southern border for so 
many months. In many cases, families 
in Latin America leave their homes for 
economic opportunities so that they 
can find a better way for their kids and 
their grandkids in the United States. 
Yet, while we were impacted here, so 
were the countries the migrants passed 
through, and each of them told us this. 
Our allies to the south—and we were 
there 
with 
them—are 
overwhelmed 
sometimes in providing shelters and 
services for those who are migrating 
through their countries, even in the 
case of Guatemala having a number of 
migrants there from Honduras and El 
Salvador and Ecuador to whom they 
are providing shelter. 
We visited some of these migrant 
shelters, one in Ecuador and one in 
Guatemala. We saw some of the very 
good work that nongovernmental orga-
nizations are doing there, including 
those supported by USAID. They pro-
vide housing, counseling, and edu-
cation to migrant families. We mostly 
saw young women and young mothers 
with young children, and many of these 
women had been trafficked. In other 
words, they had been promised the 
ability to go north, but, in effect, their 
traffickers had put them in situations 
wherein they had been abused. There-
fore, these shelters are there to try to 
protect them as much as anything else. 
It was very emotional. Their stories 
were heartbreaking. 
Again, I would just say that, in terms 
of the role the United States plays 
here, there are a number of policies we 
have in place that allow these coyotes, 
as they call the human smugglers, to 
go to a family in a poor country in 
Latin America and say: ‘‘Pay me a lot 
of money,’’ say $10,000, which for a fam-
ily in a poor part of Honduras is their 
life savings and their mortgage on 
their home and is probably money they 
have to borrow, ‘‘and we will take your 
kids to the United States. Because the 
United States allows those children to 
come in as long as they claim asylum, 
we will commit to you that we can get 
those kids into the United States, and 
they will go to school, and everything 
will be good, and maybe they can bring 
you up later.’’ The coyotes can say 
that because of our policies. 
By the way, it is not good for many 
of these children or for many of these 
women, in particular, for what happens 
on that dangerous journey north is 
something that would break your heart 
when you hear the stories. Many are 
assaulted. Some are left in the desert, 
and others are mistreated in other 
ways. 
The point is that U.S. policy contrib-
utes to this. I know this is a hard 
truth, and it may be that my col-
leagues and I can never figure this out, 
but it seems to me that we should not 
have an asylum policy that encourages 
people to come to the north and then 
to come into the country pending ap-
proval of their asylum cases when, in 
fact, only about 15 percent—that is 
one, five—of these migrants will ever 
receive asylum claims. Yet virtually 
all of them stay in the United States. 
In 2019, which was the last time we had 
a big surge like this, it was mostly 
children and unaccompanied minors, 
even though only 15 percent of them, 
on average, have had successful claims. 
What does that mean? That means that 
the United States, as I said earlier, is a 
magnet. We are pulling people north. 
These countries don’t want to lose 
their people. Many of these migrants 
are being mistreated along the way, in-
cluding children who are placed by U.S. 
Agencies into sponsor families who 
sometimes mistreat them. We have 
done studies on this. We have done two 
studies 
in 
the 
Permanent 
Sub-
committee on Investigations and bipar-
tisan studies wherein we have con-
cluded that we do not have effective 
ways to place these children who are, 
again, brought to the U.S. border and 
allowed into the United States because 
of our policies. 
I know this is a tough issue, and our 
hearts go out to these migrants—they 
really do—but we have to have a policy 
that makes sense and a policy that al-
lows people to come legally to the 
United States in an orderly way, in a 
humane way, and not continue this 
policy that effectively gives the coy-
ote, the human smuggler, a pretty good 
narrative—a pretty credible one—that, 
if you pay me, I will get you into the 
interior, into Ohio, where I am from, or 
into some other State. 
Again, the way our system works, be-
cause there is a backlog of about 1.2 
million people for these cases and be-
cause only 15 percent at the end of the 
day, on average, are going to get their 
asylum claims approved, these people 
tend to stay in the community. I don’t 
blame them for coming. I really don’t. 
Every family I have talked to along the 
border, when I have been there or down 
there when I was in these four coun-
tries over the last week, tells me the 
same thing: They want more oppor-
tunity. 
Some truly do have a fear of persecu-
tion in their countries, and they should 
be given asylum. Again, that is about 
15 percent. The vast majority, of 
course, will live lives that are lives of 
poverty. They want more opportunity, 
and we want to provide that oppor-
tunity. This is why there isn’t an issue 
right now with regard to this: How does 
the United States best help in their 
home countries? 
We talked about the pull factor, 
which is U.S. policy. By the way, when 
title 42 ends, which is a provision that 
is in place now with regard to adults to 
say: You can’t come into America be-
cause of COVID–19—when title 42 ends, 
which will happen at the end of the 
healthcare emergency, the administra-
tion needs to be prepared for a further 
surge of individuals coming to Amer-
ica—this time adults. Already, for kids, 
title 42 has been ended by the Biden ad-
ministration. Therefore, we have seen 
what has happened. Already, for most 
families, now title 42 has been ended, 
and we have seen what has happened. 
We have seen these surges of 170,000 to 
180,000 people a month. 
When it has ended for adults, it will 
be even more difficult. At a minimum, 
I would urge the Biden administration 
to be prepared as it wasn’t last time. 
You will remember the huge influx and 
the children who were left in Border 
Patrol 
detention 
facilities 
for 
far 
longer than they were legally allowed 
to be there under U.S. law and living 
side by side on the floor, on pads, at 
the time of COVID but without having 
any COVID tests. That was wrong, just 
as it will be wrong if we don’t prepare 
for the adults. My view is we should 
keep title 42 in place for now. We still 
do have a COVID issue, and countries 
to the south have an even larger 
COVID issue that is much more pro-
nounced than ours. 
We should put in place sensible poli-
cies to allow people to come in legally 
in higher numbers. I support that. 
Temporary worker programs, in my 
view, are good for both sides right now. 
We have a work shortage. We also have 
a need to ensure that these people are 
coming in a legal way, through proper 
means. We should also have rules that 
work and laws that mean something. 
People who wait in line for years in 
these countries to come legally are 
looking and saying: Why should I wait 
when my neighbor can just walk up to 
the border and come to Columbus, OH? 
So I do think there is an opportunity 
here, in having been down there and 
having talked to these countries, for us 
to do a better job in helping these 
countries to develop their own econo-
mies and to provide opportunities for 
people in those countries. This avoids 
the so-called push factor. 
Now, getting it through Congress is 
not going to be easy, and it is not going 
to be done quickly. I know that many 
are saying that $4 billion that the 
Biden administration has promised to 
these countries is going to make all of 
the difference. It will start, and that is 
good, but we have to acknowledge that 
we also need to change the pull side. It 
is going to take time—decades, in 
fact—to allow people in these countries 
to have close to the kind of economic 
opportunities that they would have in 
coming across the border. The United 
States is a country where there is still 
opportunity for everyone, including 
these migrants, and that is a great 
thing. Yet we have to be sure there is 
also a system that is orderly and legal 
to allow them to come here in a safe 
and humane way. So that is one thing 
we talked about a lot down there. 
The other thing we talked about a 
lot, as you can imagine, is the issue of 
Venezuela. I mentioned earlier what 
was going on in Cuba, and Cuba influ-
ences Venezuela greatly. The fact that

the Maduro regime in Venezuela can 
survive is because of Cuba and some 
other help, by the way, from the Rus-
sians and others. There is a problem, 
which is that the country is a basket 
case right now economically. There-
fore, people are leaving. They are surg-
ing out of the country as fast as they 
can. There are 1.7 million Venezuelan 
refugees in the country of Colombia. 
Think about that. Colombia, to its 
credit, has said: We are going to take 
care of these people. It has given them 
temporary protected status. It has 
given them places to live and shelter, 
and Colombia is taking them in as ref-
ugees. I also saw this in Ecuador, 
where they have hundreds of thousands 
of Venezuelan refugees. 
This is impacting not just Venezuela, 
but is impacting our allies in the re-
gion, who are required—again, I com-
mend them for this—to be able to help 
in this crisis. It is one reason we need 
to be sure that we deal with these 
issues in Cuba and in Venezuela to try 
to give people the ability to live in a 
free and open society, with a democ-
racy, because then they will tend to 
stay home and develop their econo-
mies, compared to what we are seeing 
in the streets of the cities of Cuba 
today and seeing the misery that we 
see in Venezuela. We talked about that 
a lot as you can imagine. 
Finally, we talked a lot about the il-
legal narcotics issue because the nar-
cotics trade is devastating these coun-
tries, not just because people are using 
in those countries, which they are, by 
the way, in increasing numbers, but 
more because of the transit going 
through these countries and the cor-
ruption that results from the huge 
amount of money that is involved in 
the drug trade. 
In a place like Colombia, unfortu-
nately, the cocaine production is up. 
During COVID, they increased the pro-
duction of cocaine, not decreased it, as 
you might think. And where is this co-
caine going? I pushed and pushed on 
the data here with the U.S. Embassy 
and with our Colombian counterparts. 
Roughly, 90 percent of this cocaine, 
they believe, is coming to the United 
States of America. 
Are we helping these countries? Cer-
tainly not by our drug policies. I men-
tioned the immigration policies earlier 
that are not helping these countries. 
How about the drug policies? If we 
can’t do a better job of reducing de-
mand in America, it is hard to see how 
these countries in Latin America can, 
all of which are affected. 
The transit through Ecuador is their 
big issue and the corruption that re-
sults. In Mexico, of course, the drug 
cartels control parts of the Mexican 
countryside right now. There is ter-
rible violence in Mexico because of the 
cartels, because of the drug trade. 
I was impressed with every President 
I met with, including President Lopez 
Obrador, who is doing his best in a very 
difficult situation. What would be help-
ful to him is to have, in his case, less 
of a crystal meth, heroin, and fentanyl 
demand in the United States, because 
that is coming into his country and 
then going up north. It is creating huge 
problems in his country, including, 
again, a higher usage in each of these 
countries as well. They are impacted 
also by the deadly nature of these 
drugs. Fentanyl, as you know, is kill-
ing more people by overdose deaths 
than any other drug right now. 
Our overdose deaths in the United 
States of America are increasing to the 
point that, over the last 12 months and 
from every data point we have, it looks 
like we had the worst year in the his-
tory of our country in terms of over-
dose deaths. 
Before the pandemic, we were mak-
ing progress. We were actually reduc-
ing use, reducing overdoses, reducing 
overdose deaths. What we did here was 
make a difference with the, roughly, $5 
billion of additional spending this 
Chamber approved in the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act and 
also in other legislation to help the 
States be able to provide better preven-
tion, better treatment options, and 
more long-term recovery. 
We were actually making progress, 
and then the pandemic hit. We have to 
get back to it, folks. We have to redou-
ble our efforts, and we have the legisla-
tion to do that. Senator WHITEHOUSE 
and I have legislation called the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act 
3.0, the third version of it. 
We need to be smarter on telehealth 
options. We need to be smarter on en-
couraging what works in terms of pre-
vention because that is good for us as a 
country but also, again, because of the 
devastation that it is causing in every 
country that I was in—in every one of 
them. They want us to do a better job 
here so that they won’t have to suffer 
the consequences there. 
When I talked to President Duque in 
Colombia, whose commitment to fight-
ing the narcotraffickers is absolutely 
critical—and we appreciate him so 
much for what he is doing—he had to 
tell me: The real issue is the demand in 
your country. It is harder for me to 
solve the problem here. 
He is absolutely right. So we can, and 
I think we will, as a Congress, begin to 
refocus on this issue, I hope, post- 
COVID and get back to a situation 
where we are seeing progress in reduc-
ing use and reducing overdoses and 
overdose deaths and, in fact, helping 
these countries be able to get back on 
their feet. 
Finally, in terms of trade, not aid 
and commerce, it is a great oppor-
tunity for us right now. Certainly, 
China thinks so. It is investing in these 
countries, and we should be too. We 
should be looking at these countries 
not just as neighbors but as true allies 
who have been with us on democracy- 
building, on human rights; who have 
been with us on international issues 
and as neighbors who really care about 
the relationship between our countries. 
My hope is that our trip, as small as 
it was with just six Senators and just a 
few days in the region, was helpful to 
ensure those ties are deepened, to es-
tablish new ties, and to, perhaps, with 
some of the followup we are going to 
do, encourage more investment, more 
trade, and more commerce with these 
countries. But also, I hope that it was 
an eye-opener for all of us that we have 
got our role to do here. We need an im-
migration policy that makes sense, not 
just for us, but for these countries as 
well. We need to have a policy with re-
gard to drugs where we are doing a bet-
ter job at reducing the demand side of 
the equation, not that we shouldn’t 
stop on the eradication of crops and 
the interdiction of drugs. 
It all helps to reduce the issue, be-
cause the price of the drug will go up if 
there is less supply, and that is impor-
tant for fentanyl which is so inexpen-
sive and so deadly and so powerful. But 
the most important thing by far is to 
allow people to get into treatment—un-
derstanding this is a disease—to allow 
people to have longer-term recovery 
options and to come up with more ef-
fective ways to prevent the use of the 
drug in the first place and to ensure 
that we are working together with our 
Latin neighbors and with our commu-
nities here in this country to do just 
that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Utah. 
REMEMBERING DEAN COX 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the out-
standing legacy of my dear friend Dean 
Cox. His enduring commitment to pub-
lic service over the course of his life 
and his consequential career are wor-
thy of the highest praise. 
Many Utahns knew Dean as an ac-
complished Washington County com-
missioner, but those closest to him 
knew him as a loving friend, a neigh-
bor, dad, grandfather, and husband, 
who devoted his life to helping others. 
With 
Dean’s 
passing, 
Washington 
County has lost one of its finest public 
servants. Dean’s legacy reminds us 
that the most reliable path to success 
in public and private life is marked by 
an unwavering dedication to principle 
and compassion. 
With people from across our State, 
we extend our deepest sympathy to his 
family and his loved ones. He is a man 
we will miss very, very much. 
Dean’s lifetime of public service in 
Washington County and across south-
ern Utah cements his reputation as an 
indispensable expert on a wide range of 
vital services for first responders, busi-
nesses, and State and local govern-
ments. 
A true son of southern Utah, Dean 
was raised on the family pasture by his 
veteran father and caring mother in St. 
George. Throughout his youth, Dean 
learned how to fix just about anything 
in his father’s garage and mechanic’s 
shop, mastering his trade craft in Bob’s 
Garage. 
The course of his life would, however, 
change while attending Brigham Young

University. There, he would meet the 
love of his life, LaRene Leavitt, and 
the two would soon dedicate their lives 
to raising their four children at their 
home in St. George. 
Dean and his brother decided to pur-
chase Bob’s Garage and carry on the 
family tradition. Their shop—renamed 
Colorland Sales and Service—was not 
only a successful small business, but it 
allowed Dean the opportunity to pass 
along the skills he had learned from his 
dad to his own children as well. 
Dean’s career in public service began 
as a volunteer emergency responder in 
Washington County. As a stellar radio 
operator and licensed pilot since the 
age of 19, Dean’s emergency coordina-
tion efforts through major disaster re-
sponses and other trials earned him ex-
perience and admiration from the com-
munities he protected. 
Impressed by his years of excellent 
service, Washington County offered 
Dean the critical role of county admin-
istrator, where he executed the policies 
set forth by the county commission. 
Then when a seat on the commission 
became available, Dean was encour-
aged to join the race. His candidacy 
was backed by three decades of local 
knowledge, by his expertise and broad 
popularity within the community. 
Victorious, Dean then became the de-
cisionmaker. Without a doubt, the 
hallmark of Commissioner Cox’s legacy 
is his successful breakthrough in secur-
ing approval for the Northern Corridor 
project. His pragmatism and willing-
ness to reach compromise was the key 
to resolving long-held disagreements 
between disparate parties. His efforts 
yielded a win for the transportation 
needs of the Nation’s fastest growing 
State and a win for the wildlife con-
servation of its most beautiful. 
Last year, 80 percent of his constitu-
ents reelected Dean Cox to be their 
Commissioner—80 percent. Despite this 
incredible achievement, illness would 
tragically force Dean to receive hos-
pital care, including chemotherapy. To 
his character, Dean continued to serve 
while undergoing this treatment. 
He passed away surrounded by loved 
ones, and he is survived by his loving 
family: his wife, LaRene; his son Jeff-
ery, and Tanna, Matthew, Keira, and 
Camille; 
his 
daughter 
Elisa, 
and 
Quinten, Ethan, Anna, and Audrey; his 
daughter Kristen, and Thomas, Kate, 
Jonas, and Hailey; his son Edward, and 
Karen, Emery, and Everett. 
At every step of Dean’s remarkable 
career, his sweetheart LaRene stood by 
his side. Her love and support sustained 
him through decades of selfless public 
service, and now, LaRene carries on his 
wonderful legacy. Our great State owes 
Dean and LaRene Cox a debt of grati-
tude for their friendship and kindness 
to all and their indelible contributions 
to southern Utah’s destiny. 
Our hearts go out to them. We love 
them dearly and pray for happiness and 
joy in their ultimate reunion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the crisis at our southern border. We 
have the humanitarian crisis there. We 
have a healthcare crisis there. And we 
also have a national security crisis 
there. 
Over the last 2 weeks, as I traveled 
the State of Wyoming, I heard from 
people all across the State about the 
condition of the southern border, and 
not surprisingly, the people of Wyo-
ming recognize that there is actually a 
crisis at the southern border, and there 
is chaos at our border. 
People across the State of Wyoming 
are shocked—shocked—at the way the 
Biden administration has been acting 
deliberately to weaken our national se-
curity and security at our border. We 
need to strengthen our southern bor-
der. Leaving the border open is like 
leaving the door to your home open; 
maybe some good friends will come 
through the door, but sooner or later, 
the wrong people will enter your home. 
An open border is an open invitation, 
and it is an invitation to the whole 
world. Now, this includes drug dealers, 
sex traffickers, and it includes gang 
members, and it even includes terror-
ists. When President Biden took office, 
he flipped on the green light, and he 
rolled out the welcome mat. He sent a 
message to the world. The message was 
received: The border is open. 
Since President Biden took office, 
600,000 illegal immigrants have been ar-
rested crossing the border. This is more 
than the entire population of my home 
State of Wyoming. Border arrests have 
gone up every month since President 
Biden has been in the White House. 
Last month, a deputy Commissioner 
of the Border Patrol retired after 27 
years in that office. His name is Robert 
Perez. Since leaving office, he has had 
a few things to say. He said: ‘‘What 
[Border Patrol is] seeing since Feb-
ruary 
. . . 
is 
absolutely 
unprece-
dented.’’ He said, ‘‘It’s a crisis unlike 
anything I’ve ever seen. . . .’’ 
Right now, we are on the pace to 2 
million illegal immigrants. That is 
what we are looking at, 2 million ille-
gal immigrants crossing the southern 
border into the United States this year 
alone. That is the most in two decades, 
and those are just the illegal immi-
grants that we know about. In addi-
tion, tens of thousands of additional il-
legal immigrants are coming across 
the border and are not being stopped. 
At the same time, we are seizing 
more fentanyl at our border than ever 
before. The numbers are astonishing. 
This drug is so powerful that a fatal 
dose is the equivalent to just a pinch of 
salt. In the last 6 months, Border Pa-
trol has seized enough fentanyl to kill 
every man, woman, and child in Amer-
ica. Some experts will say that the 
amount they have captured, in terms 
of the synthetic drug fentanyl, is a 
small fraction of the amount that is 
actually getting across the border 
every day. This would mean a quarter- 
million pounds of fentanyl is likely to 
flow into the United States this year 
alone, and it is not just staying at our 
southern border. It is in every State of 
the Union. 
Look, this just didn’t happen. Six 
months ago, the border was nearly se-
cure. Then Joe Biden was sworn into 
office, and he undid the successful poli-
cies of the previous administration. He 
stopped building the wall even though 
it has already been paid for. 
Under the previous administration, 
asylum seekers had to remain in Mex-
ico until their day in court. President 
Biden stopped that. He ended that pol-
icy, basically saying to everyone: Come 
in. 
It does seem that anything the pre-
vious administration did that was done 
successfully, President Biden has cho-
sen to do the opposite. This isn’t pol-
icymaking; this is knee-jerk partisan-
ship. 
President Biden has had 6 months to 
fix the crisis that we are living with 
today. He is only making it worse, and 
he is doubling down on the mistakes he 
has already made. It wasn’t enough to 
end the Remain in Mexico policy, 
which was successful and which Border 
Patrol agents tell me needs to be put 
back in place if the goal is actually to 
secure the border. 
Now, the Biden administration seems 
to be actively looking for people who 
had to wait in Mexico under President 
Trump and let them into the United 
States. He is inviting them into our 
country, and he is not stopping there. 
He is going further. 
Now, it seems like President Biden is 
going to open the door even wider. Last 
year, at the start of the pandemic, the 
previous administration closed our bor-
ders to people from coronavirus-im-
pacted areas. This was a decision made 
by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. They did this under title 42 
of our laws. This is a section of our 
laws related to public health. 
Well, it is likely to have saved thou-
sands of American lives and protected 
our public health. It has also helped 
our Border Patrol. They will tell you 
that. They will tell you that this has 
helped them to stem the flow of illegal 
immigration over the past year. 
But now, President Biden, I under-
stand, wants to end that policy—at 
least that is what the White House is 
telling the press. That means the crisis 
at the border is going to get even 
worse. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it, listen to what Democratic Congress-
man from San Antonio, Congressman 
HENRY CUELLAR, had to say. He rep-
resents a district in Texas right on the 
border—lives there, goes home every 
weekend, talks to the people, and 
knows the situation on the border. He 
recently said ending the title 42 order 
is ‘‘going to provide another incen-
tive.’’ He said, ‘‘The drug cartels are 
going to start saying you can come 
in.’’ That is Congressman CUELLAR, of 
Texas, and I believe he is right.

July 13, 2021 
President Biden has removed almost 
all of the policies protecting our bor-
der. Title 42 is the last one standing. 
Now, he is going to take this one down 
as well. Well, if he does, it will open 
the floodgates. I would expect tens of 
thousands more illegal immigrants 
coming into the country. It would cre-
ate even more chaos from criminals all 
across the land—not just from Mexico, 
but from all across the world, coming 
across our southern border. 
As a physician, I am concerned about 
this decision from the fentanyl stand-
point and also from the standpoint of 
the disease, the coronavirus and the 
new variants we are all dealing with. 
We know that people are coming from 
all over the world. 
When I was at the border this spring, 
at the Donna facility near McAllen, 
TX, the border agents said they had ar-
rested people from more than 50 dif-
ferent countries coming across that 
southern border from Mexico into the 
United States. 
Now, this includes lots of places 
where the vaccination rates are much, 
much lower than they are in the 
United States and in some places where 
vaccines aren’t even available. 
At the same time, we are seeing new 
variants of coronavirus rapidly spread-
ing across the world; variants that are 
coming from other places; variants 
that are deadly; variants for which the 
vaccines that we have here in the 
United States may not be as effective 
as we had thought or as we would hope. 
So the country’s threat for all of us 
is real. Since the pandemic began, 
more than 8,000 Border Patrol agents 
and officers have tested positive for 
coronavirus, and 32 of these agents 
have died of coronavirus. 
When I visited the border, I saw first-
hand how unaccompanied children were 
routinely exposed to coronavirus. When 
I visited, roughly 1 in 10 of these young 
people who had tested, tested positive 
for coronavirus. And they were all to-
gether in these holding pens, crammed 
in like sardines, one exposing the other 
and the other after that. These holding 
facilities packed 7,000 young people 
into one facility the day we were there, 
and they have exposed everyone in the 
facility. 
And, of course, after their time in the 
holding facility, they are released— 
many of them released while positive. 
So as new variants spread around the 
world, this puts our Nation in serious 
danger. 
That is why Republican Senators are 
sending a letter to President Biden. 
Our message to President Biden is this: 
Leave the CDC protection under title 
42 in place. The American people need 
it. We need it from a public health 
standpoint. 
It 
protects 
our 
public 
health. It protects our border agents. It 
strengthens our border security. 
There is enough chaos at the border 
already—too many drugs, too many 
criminals, and they are already cross-
ing the border. We need to stop this 
knee-jerk partisanship. And we need to 
get back to the policies that we know 
work; the policies that the Border Pa-
trol tells us work; the policies that the 
Border Patrol advised the Biden transi-
tion team, prior to Joe Biden’s getting 
sworn in and inaugurated as President 
of the United States, to keep in place. 
We need to finish the wall that has 
already been paid for. We need to bring 
back the Remain in Mexico policy. We 
need to enforce the law. We need to 
close the loopholes. We need to slam 
the door shut on the drug cartels. It is 
time to secure our border once and for 
all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
every State of the Nation has many in-
frastructure needs. In Iowa, we rely on 
our roads, bridges, air, and freight to 
move our goods and people throughout 
Iowa, throughout the United States, 
and eventually throughout the world. I 
am 
encouraged 
that 
a 
bipartisan 
framework has been agreed to for mov-
ing forward on an infrastructure bill. I 
will be interested in seeing more de-
tails about the policy and the way to 
pay for the bill as the bill proceeds for-
ward. 
Today, I would like to discuss one as-
pect of infrastructure, and that is our 
inland waterways. For Iowa, that is the 
Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers. 
For other States, it is a lot of other 
important rivers. 
I ask my colleagues to take this im-
portant mode of transportation into 
account as they work on legislation. I 
have also sent this request in a letter 
to both the Senate Environment and 
Public Works as well as the Appropria-
tions Committees. 
The inland and intercostal water-
ways and our ports are vital to the 
United States and serve 41 States 
throughout our Nation. Shippers and 
consumers depend on the ability to 
move around 630 million tons of cargo 
each year, valued at about $232 billion 
on these waterways. In turn, the inland 
waterways system supports well over 
half a million jobs. 
Now, I am going to go into some of 
the information that is on the chart 
here. 
Our Nation’s inland waterways sys-
tem also provides a safe, cost-effective, 
fuel-efficient, 
and 
environmentally 
friendly way to move our bulk prod-
ucts. This translates into more than 
$12 billion annually in transportation 
savings to the American economy. 
Furthermore—and when I say ‘‘fur-
thermore,’’ this point is important for 
the environment—1 gallon of fuel oil 
allows 1 ton of cargo to be shipped 647 
miles by barge as compared to 477 
miles by rail and only 145 miles by 
truck. 
In addition, the inland waterway 
transport generates far fewer emissions 
of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and 
nitrous oxide than rail or truck per 
million tons of miles does. 
As for safety, there are 21—let’s say 
22 rail fatalities compared to 79 truck 
fatalities for every 1 fatality on the 
waterways system that I am address-
ing. 
By moving goods on inland water-
ways, we are helping to relieve conges-
tion on the roadways and adding to the 
Nation’s economic prosperity. Moving 
goods on inland waterways is the most 
efficient transportation mode. A typ-
ical inland barge has a capacity 15 
times greater than 1 railcar and 60 
times 
greater 
than 
1 
semi-trailer 
truck. One 15-barge tow can move the 
equivalent of 216 railcars pulled by 6 lo-
comotives or 1,050 semi-trailer trucks, 
just as a comparison of the efficiency 
of this mode of transportation. If the 
cargo transported on the inland water-
ways each year had to be moved by an-
other mode, it would take an addi-
tional 16 percent more tonnage on the 
railroad system and 49 million truck 
trips annually to carry the same load. 
U.S. trade policy and its effects on 
exports, and in particular agricultural 
exports, have a major impact on the 
U.S. water transportation system. 
The United States is the world’s larg-
est 
agricultural 
exporting 
country. 
U.S. agriculture exports in 2018—the 
last year we have figures for—gen-
erated more than $300 billion in eco-
nomic output and directly supported 
more than 1 million jobs. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, about one out of every 
three acres farmed in our country are 
planted for export. Agricultural ex-
ports account for about a quarter of 
farm cash receipts, in which 73 percent 
of these exports and 65 percent of im-
ports were carried on U.S. waterways. 
American farmers need foreign mar-
kets to sell commodities and value- 
added agricultural products. 
Compared to the overall economy, 
U.S. agriculture is twice as reliant on 
overseas markets. Consumers in devel-
oping 
countries 
around 
the 
world 
choose different foods to eat as their 
incomes rise. As a result, then, there 
are emerging opportunities for export-
ing more meat, dairy products, and 
farm commodities. U.S. exporters need 
to be able to take advantage of those 
opportunities with only 96 percent of 
the world’s consumers living outside 
the United States. Obviously, for the 4 
percent of the people who live in the 
United States, if you want to market, 
you are going to spend a lot of time 
marketing to that 96 percent who live 
outside our country. 
As the largest exporter of agricul-
tural products in the world, the United 
States delivers high-quality, reliable 
products to consumers around the 
globe. Now, here at home, these ex-
ports are essential to profitability in

agriculture, and the economic activity 
they 
generate 
obviously 
ripples 
through the domestic economy. 
We need to make sure that our cur-
rent inland waterway infrastructure is 
maintained in good condition. Congress 
has implemented policy changes that 
provide more funding for the Inland 
Waterways Trust Fund and adjusted 
cost shares of the trust fund to more 
efficiently fund and complete the con-
struction projects. I ask for robust 
funding to support the use of the In-
land Waterways Trust Fund for con-
struction. This is necessary to ensure 
that the inland waterways moderniza-
tion, replacement, and rehabilitation 
construction projects are funded at the 
level supportable by the Inland Water-
ways Trust Fund. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Civil Works program currently faces a 
large unmet need in its operations and 
maintenance account. I have been en-
couraged that in the last several years, 
Congress has provided additional fund-
ing to help address these backlogs. I re-
quest as much funding as possible be 
provided for these operation and main-
tenance activities. 
The investigations account is also 
crucial for the inland waterways sys-
tem. There are currently 15 moderniza-
tion projects that are waiting to begin 
construction. It is critically important 
to complete design of these projects so 
they can begin construction when the 
Inland Waterways Trust Fund dollars 
become available. Failure to have de-
sign completed will delay project deliv-
ery, ultimately leading to increased 
total cost of the projects, as well as 
adding additional time to schedule 
project completion. I ask that the in-
vestigations account be funded at a 
level to support these projects, given 
current budgetary constraints. 
On the Upper Mississippi River, mul-
tiple locks are well beyond their 50- 
year design life and cannot accommo-
date more tows, as we have to have the 
barges break up their tows to get them 
through smaller locks. So having to de-
couple the barges significantly slows 
down traffic on the river and increases 
costs and emissions harmful, then, to 
the environment. 
I worked with my Upper Mississippi 
River colleagues here in the Senate and 
a large, broad stakeholder coalition to 
get initial authorization for this lock 
and dam modernization, the Naviga-
tion and Ecosystem Restoration Pro-
gram, signed into law. We have also 
continued 
to 
work 
on 
receiving 
preconstruction engineering design and 
funding that is provided for in the 
Navigation and Ecosystem Restoration 
Program. It is important for that pro-
gram to receive new start funding so 
construction on these improvements 
can start taking place. 
Lock and Dam 25, which is a key fea-
ture of the navigation and ecosystem 
program, has received a significant 
portion of the $72.5 million appro-
priated for the navigation and eco-
system program thus far and is ready 
to move to construction. That program 
is a key priority for me and my col-
leagues, the State of Iowa, the region, 
and everybody up and down the Mis-
sissippi River, and, eventually, the 
world benefits from that increased effi-
ciency. 
We need all modes of transportation 
to help deliver our inputs, our goods, 
and commodities both domestically 
and internationally. I want to see ro-
bust navigation on the Mississippi 
River and other inland waterways 
flourish. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my congressional colleagues and 
the administration on these important 
issues as appropriations and infrastruc-
ture legislation is prepared and dis-
cussed. 
I have one other short comment I 
would like to make on another subject. 
It will take me about 2 or 3 minutes. 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
Mr. President, I have spoken many 
times about the importance of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. It should go without saying 
that these documents are foundational 
to our Nation. They were revolutionary 
texts for the time that laid out our 
timeless founding ideals, and we still 
continue to strive toward those ideals 
as Americans. Unfortunately, it seems 
this fact can’t be taken for granted 
anymore. 
So, on the Fourth of July, National 
Public Radio continued its tradition of 
sharing the text of the declaration, but 
something 
different 
happened 
this 
year. It began the program with what 
they call in colleges now a ‘‘trigger 
warning,’’ telling its audience that 
‘‘the declaration is a document with 
flaws and deeply ingrained hypoc-
risies.’’ 
Now, instead of highlighting the 
American ideals that it laid out, NPR 
decided that the most important thing 
to note was that it contained outdated 
language about Native Americans and 
that its ideals were not yet fully real-
ized when it was written. 
I can think of many ways to intro-
duce a reader to this document, but it 
fundamentally misses the point to 
focus on the flaws of the authors and 
signers rather than the ideals it lays 
out of natural rights endowed to all by 
our Creator. The people who wrote the 
declaration were not perfect, just like 
we aren’t perfect today, but the prin-
ciples they espoused remain true to 
this day and have changed the course 
of human history for the better. 
We need not ignore the fact that the 
Founders did not live up to the lofty 
goals that they set, but it does a great 
disservice to focus on those flaws while 
glossing over the fact that our found-
ing principles were truly exceptional in 
human history. They set us on a path 
to abolish slavery, provide the jus-
tification for women’s suffrage, and 
formed the basis of the civil rights 
movement. 
On July 4, we celebrate our Nation, 
‘‘conceived in liberty and dedicated to 
the proposition that all men are cre-
ated equal,’’ as Abraham Lincoln so 
stated. It is imperative that we do not 
lose sight of our founding principles, 
which unite all Americans and have 
been the driving force helping us 
achieve a more perfect Union.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE LOUISVILLE 
METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, on July 2, 
2021, a quick succession of events that 
lasted only 30 minutes shocked a Lou-
isville neighborhood and showcased the 
extraordinary professionalism of the 
Louisville Metro Police Department. 
Together, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
MetroSafe Dispatch and information 
provided by a vigilant civilian, the 
stranger abduction of a 6-year-old girl 
was witnessed and reported, the sus-
pect’s 
vehicle 
was 
identified 
and 
stopped, and the victim was rescued— 
unharmed—and returned to her family. 
People around the Nation have now 
seen the emotional bodycam video of 
the moment when Officer Burba picked 
up this young girl and whisked her to 
safety. It is a scene that brings a tear 
to the eye of every loving parent. 
Stranger abduction is rare, thankfully, 
but it is even rarer that such quick ac-
tion leads to a conclusion such as this. 
While one officer’s actions were im-
mortalized on film, today I want to 
recognize 
all 
of 
the 
members 
of 
LMPD’s Third Division, First Platoon, 
Squad One. Each officer was willing to 
risk personal injury to rescue this 
child and capture the suspect. They in-
clude Sergeant Joe Keeling, Officers 
Stephen Barone, Jason Burns, Travis 
Elder, Charles Ennis, Aaron Flannery, 
Malliccaaii 
Green, 
Nicholas 
Green, 
Clint Greene, Jake Harris, Mark Man-
ning, Aimee Mills, Michael Rach, Brad-
ley Russell, Tom Stettenbenz and 
Lucero Aguilera Vasquez. 
Key members of MetroSafe Dispatch 
who handled the response were Dis-
patchers Emily David and Hannah Hur-
ley, and Jim Intermaggio, who took 
the inbound call. 
Finally, although several citizens 
made 911 calls regarding the incident, 
Prentiss Weathrford, who witnessed 
the abduction, pursued the vehicle and 
took down critical license plate infor-
mation. 
This LMPD squad, a capable dispatch 
team, and an alert citizen worked in 
concert to redeem what could have 
been a most tragic scenario. I am 
grateful to them, and the community 
is grateful. And I believe that the fam-
ily of this 6-year-old girl would agree 
that all those who responded are de-
serving of this special distinction.∑

RECOGNIZING EMSI BURNING 
GLASS 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a sen-
ior member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today I am 
pleased to honor Emsi Burning Glass in 
Moscow as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for July 2021. 
Emsi Burning Glass, initially named 
Emsi, is a labor market analytics com-
pany founded by economists Hank 
Robison and Kjell Christophersen in 
2001 that specializes in providing labor 
market data, analytics, and consulting 
services for higher education institu-
tions, private enterprises, and work-
force development agencies. One of the 
company’s initial goals was to provide 
at least 50 high-paying jobs to the Mos-
cow community. It has since surpassed 
that goal and employs 280 people. 
Since its founding, the company has 
achieved outstanding success and now 
has clients throughout the United 
Kingdom, Canada, and the United 
States. The business has become one of 
the fastest growing companies in Mos-
cow, and its success has enabled it to 
provide hundreds of quality jobs in the 
region and further invest in the local 
community. In 2019, Emsi announced it 
would construct a new 3.7-acre campus 
that will allow it to hire hundreds of 
new software developers, engineers, 
data scientists, economists, sales rep-
resentatives, and other high-paying po-
sitions. 
The company’s success has not gone 
unnoticed. In June 2021, Emsi an-
nounced a merger with Burning Glass, 
a fellow labor market analytics firm in 
Boston and its name was formally 
changed to Emsi Burning Glass. The 
merger will allow the company to con-
tinue its growth in Moscow while ex-
panding its presence in the global mar-
ketplace. 
Congratulations to all of the employ-
ees of Emsi Burning Glass on being se-
lected as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for July 2021. You make our 
great State proud, and I look forward 
to your continued growth and success.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 298—DESIG-
NATING JULY 15, 2021, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
LEIOMYOSARCOMA 
AWARENESS 
DAY’’ 
AND 
THE 
MONTH OF JULY 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
SARCOMA 
AWARENESS 
MONTH’’ 
Ms. STABENOW submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 298 
Whereas sarcoma is a rare type of cancer 
that— 
(1) arises in the connective tissue of the 
body; and 
(2) accounts for approximately 1 percent of 
all newly diagnosed cancers; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health 
designates sarcoma, which contains approxi-
mately 70 different subtypes, as a rare form 
of cancer; 
Whereas sarcomas are largely resistant to 
current 
chemotherapy 
agents, 
immunotherapy agents, and radiation thera-
pies, posing a formidable challenge for re-
searchers and specialists; 
Whereas sarcoma subtypes largely have 
not benefitted from immunotherapies be-
cause 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
DNA, 
genomes, and mutations associated with the 
many variations in the sarcoma subtype 
landscape; 
Whereas leiomyosarcoma (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘LMS’’) is a malignant, ag-
gressive subtype of sarcoma derived from 
smooth muscle cells typically of uterine, 
gastrointestinal, or soft tissue origin that 
can metastasize to the bone, spine, brain, 
and liver; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health 
classifies LMS, which encompasses at least 4 
different LMS subtypes, as a rare disease, ac-
counting for approximately 15 percent of all 
sarcomas; 
Whereas LMS primarily affects adults 
without regard to gender; 
Whereas, with respect to LMS— 
(1) research and clinical trials remain com-
plicated; and 
(2) survival and longevity remain difficult; 
Whereas multidisciplinary care coordina-
tion teams, because of their expertise and ex-
perience, are critical to the health of sar-
coma and LMS patients; 
Whereas sarcoma and LMS research will— 
(1) allow medical professionals to improve 
the quality of care for affected patients; 
(2) lead to better clinical outcomes; and 
(3) promote longer survival for patients; 
and 
Whereas increased education and aware-
ness about sarcoma and LMS will contribute 
to the well-being of the communities of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 15, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Leiomyosarcoma Awareness Day’’; 
(2) designates the month of July 2021 as 
‘‘National Sarcoma Awareness Month’’; 
(3) recognizes the challenges faced by sar-
coma and leiomyosarcoma patients; and 
(4) commends the dedication of organiza-
tions, volunteers, researchers, and caregivers 
across the United States working to improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
sarcoma 
and 
leiomyosarcoma patients and their families.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
299—COM-
MEMORATING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
NATIONAL 
CENTER 
FOR 
TOXICOLOGICAL 
RESEARCH 
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. 
COTTON) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 299 
Whereas, in 1971, President Richard Nixon 
established the National Center for Toxi-
cological Research (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘NCTR’’) in Jefferson, Arkan-
sas, as part of the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘FDA’’)— 
(1) to provide scientific proof that United 
States consumers are protected from toxic 
chemicals, drugs, and other agents; and 
(2) when appropriate, to determine safe lev-
els of substances in consumer goods; 
Whereas the FDA is responsible for— 
(1) regulating domestically produced and 
imported food, cosmetics, drugs, vaccines, 
blood, biologics, medical devices, radiation- 
emitting products, animal and veterinary 
products, and tobacco products; and 
(2) overseeing— 
(A) the safety of every life in the United 
States; and 
(B) more than $1,000,000,000,000 worth of 
consumer goods, which are estimated to in-
clude 
$466,000,000,000 
in 
food 
sales, 
$275,000,000,000 in drug sales, $60,000,000,000 
in cosmetic sales, and $18,000,000,000 in vi-
tamin supplement sales; 
Whereas the NCTR is a research institu-
tion— 
(1) housed in more than 1,000,000 square 
feet of facilities, including 123 laboratories 
across 30 buildings, in Jefferson, Arkansas; 
(2) that has 680 employees who reside in 17 
counties across the State of Arkansas; and 
(3) 
that 
contributes 
approximately 
$70,000,000 to the local, State, and national 
economies, including investments of approxi-
mately $10,000,000 annually via construction, 
maintenance, and renovation projects that 
stimulate the local economy; 
Whereas, in 2011, the FDA and the State of 
Arkansas composed a framework for a for-
mal working relationship to foster stronger 
partnerships, leverage vital resources, and 
operate collaboratively to promote effi-
ciency that has been continually renewed 
and supported by both parties; 
Whereas the NCTR has a long history of 
providing scientific advice and training to 
researchers in government, academia, and 
industry at local, State, national, and inter-
national levels, which is exemplified by— 
(1) training Ph.D. candidates and other re-
searchers from universities in the State of 
Arkansas; 
(2) collaborating with university research-
ers throughout the State of Arkansas; and 
(3) providing millions of dollars in funding 
for university research throughout the State 
of Arkansas; 
Whereas the mutual benefits between the 
NCTR and the State of Arkansas can only 
continue if the NCTR remains robustly sup-
ported by the Federal Government; 
Whereas the benefits of the NCTR were 
heightened during the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic when the Director 
of the NCTR, Dr. William Slikker, worked 
with the State of Arkansas to rapidly pro-
vide critical COVID–19 testing equipment to 
the Arkansas Department of Health; and 
Whereas the NCTR will hold a 50th anni-
versary celebration on August 11, 2021, in 
Jefferson, Arkansas: Now, therefore, be it— 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of 
the National Center for Toxicological Re-
search; and 
(2) recognizes the significance of the con-
tributions made by the National Center for 
Toxicological Research and its relationship 
with the State of Arkansas.

PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Savannah 
Tanguis, an intern in my office, be 
granted floor privileges today, July 13, 
2021. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
this series of ‘‘Scheme’’ speeches is de-
signed to chronicle a long-running, 
covert scheme to capture the Supreme 
Court. Regulatory Agencies have often 
and notoriously been captured by regu-
lated interests. There is a whole doc-
trine of regulatory capture found in ec-
onomics and administrative law that 
revolves around this history of the reg-
ulatory 
capture 
of 
administrative 
Agencies. So, if you can capture admin-
istrative Agencies to serve special in-
terests, why not capture a court? 
The trajectory of these ‘‘Scheme’’ 
speeches has been through time, begin-
ning with the Lewis Powell strategy 
report to the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce and then his enabling of that 
strategy as a Justice of the Supreme 
Court and then how the rightwing 
fringe was brought into organized 
alignment by the Koch brothers and 
then, of course, the link to this regu-
latory capture apparatus and its will-
ing band of mercenary lawyers and wit-
nesses. 
Tonight, I interrupt that time trajec-
tory to discuss two decisions just deliv-
ered by the Supreme Court, decisions 
that clearly reflect the patterns and 
purposes of the Court capture effort. 
Let me start by saying that the sin-
gle most important goal of this covert 
scheme is to protect itself. The appa-
ratus behind the scheme may be put to 
innumerable political uses, but none of 
those political uses will be effectuated 
unless the underlying apparatus pro-
tects itself and stays operational. Sur-
vival of this operation is job one, and a 
core strategy for protecting its covert 
operations is camouflage. 
To camouflage this scheme you need 
anonymity for the donors behind the 
operation. The scheme is blown if there 
is transparency. The clandestine con-
nections among front groups become 
apparent, and the manipulating hands 
of the string pullers behind the surrep-
titious scheme become visible. Voters 
then see the scheme, understand the 
players and the motives, get the joke, 
so to speak, and the operation is blown. 
So anonymity—donor anonymity—is 
essential. Voters may hate big, anony-
mous donors, but big, anonymous do-
nors need anonymity. 
The term for this anonymous fund-
ing, now pouring by the billions of dol-
lars into our politics, is ‘‘dark money.’’ 
This is a dark money operation, and if 
you are out to capture a court, you will 
want to make sure that court will pro-
tect your dark money—the camouflage 
for all of your covert operations. That 
is job one, which brings us to the 
Americans for Prosperity Foundation 
case. 
The Americans for Prosperity Foun-
dation is a central front group of the 
Koch brothers’ political influence oper-
ation. It sued to prevent California 
from getting access to donor informa-
tion of the so-called nonprofits, like 
itself, that, since Citizens United, have 
provided screening, anonymity for the 
megadonors behind their political ef-
forts. For these political groups, donor 
anonymity is vital for the scheme to 
function. 
Now, one of the ways the dark money 
operation signals its desires to the 
Court is through little flotillas of dark 
money groups that show up as what are 
called friends of the Court—‘‘amicus 
curiae,’’ to use the legal term—to pro-
vide guidance to the Justices. Little 
flotillas of dark money groups showed 
up in Cedar Point, in Seila Law v. 
CFPB, in Rucho v. Common Cause, in 
Knick v. Township of Scott, in Lamps 
Plus, in Epic Systems, in Janus v. 
AFSCME, in Husted v. Randolph Insti-
tute, and in a host of other cases. In 
each case, the little signaling flotilla 
showed up. In each case, the Court de-
livered a partisan win for the little flo-
tilla. They usually number a dozen or 
so, and it is happening in plain view, 
except that what is not in plain view is 
who is funding the little orchestrated 
flotillas. That, the Court helps to keep 
secret. 
So these signaling flotillas that ap-
pear in these cases and generate these 
partisan 
victories 
usually 
number 
about a dozen but not in the Americans 
for Prosperity Foundation case, not in 
this case. In this case, 50 of them 
showed up—50. I think that is a record, 
kind of a personal best for the dark 
money armada, and they showed up 
early on, at the certiorari stage, at the 
stage when the Court decides whether 
or not to take the case—50 dark money 
groups showing up at the certiorari 
stage. 
This was a blaring red alert to the 
Republicans on the Supreme Court as 
to how important this case was to the 
dark money operation. Sure enough, 
just like in all of the other cases I men-
tioned, the Court delivered. The Repub-
lican Justices on the Supreme Court 
just established a new constitutional 
right to donor secrecy, and they did so 
for a group, the Americans for Pros-
perity Foundation, that is flagrantly 
involved in rightwing political mis-
chief and manipulation—flagrantly in-
volved. 
The Americans for Prosperity Foun-
dation group’s operating entity had ac-
tually even spent millions of dollars 
just last year to help get Justice Bar-
rett confirmed. They are so brazen 
about this that they actually used the 
Americans for Prosperity Foundation 
as the named party, not some benign, 
nonpolitical entity that they could 
have dredged up. No, they took the bet 
that this precedent of a politically ac-
tive manipulator being the named 
party would not faze the Republicans 
on the Court, and they would be able, 
with that partisan majority, to gain a 
legal foothold for their dark money po-
litical spending. 
There are few things that enrage the 
American public more than crooked, 
dark money political spending. If you 
tried to get a dark money political 
spending bill through the Senate, you 
couldn’t do it. If you tried to get it 
through the House, you couldn’t do it. 
If you put the Senate and House under 
Republican control, you still couldn’t 
do it, but if you have captured the Su-
preme Court and have sent 50 dark 
money groups in a big signaling ar-
mada and have told them what you 
want, then a decision that is as un-
popular and enraging as this decision 
comes your way, and they pulled it off 
in plain daylight. 
Justice Barrett even declined to 
recuse herself—that is how brazen this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4859 
July 13, 2021 
is—despite the Caperton case precedent 
of recusing in cases involving parties 
who spent millions to get you on the 
Court. Not a peep about that conflict of 
interest. Not a peep about that effec-
tive repeal of the Caperton case. 
This Republican majority completely 
ignored the assertions of the Repub-
lican majority that gave us Citizens 
United: that transparency and political 
spending is our protection against cor-
ruption. That was the hook for Citizens 
United: Don’t worry, folks. We can let 
unlimited amounts of special interest 
money pour into politics, and it won’t 
be corrupting because it will be trans-
parent. Everybody will see or hear at 
the end of the ad: ‘‘I am ExxonMobil, 
and I approve this message.’’ That was 
the trick of Citizens United. 
I suppose you could say that it was a 
safe bet that this Republican majority 
would not be concerned about donor 
transparency the way the Citizens 
United Republican majority was, be-
cause the Republicans on the Court, 
after Citizens United, turned a com-
pletely blind eye to billions of dark 
money dollars that poured into our pol-
itics. 
They had said that was corrupting, 
but every chance they got to impose 
their own decision and clean up the 
dark money corruption, they scru-
pulously refused to do it. They did not 
or pretended not to see it. 
So if you are this apparatus and you 
think you have captured the Court and 
you look at the blind eye that had 
turned to these flagrant, constant, 
massive violations of the supposed 
Citizens United transparency principle, 
you take your shot, and they did. And 
what it looks like now is that it was 
window dressing in Citizens United to 
pretend to care about transparency, 
and what it looks like now is that this 
new Republican majority has tossed 
even that window dressing into the 
dumpster. 
This Americans for Prosperity Foun-
dation decision looks totally outcome 
driven—not 
applying 
the 
law, 
but 
changing 
the 
law 
to 
favor 
dark 
money—and the decision was on a 
purely partisan basis, all the Repub-
licans. 
The end result here is that this dark 
money empire that spends billions of 
dollars in our politics has just been 
given by the Republican Justices a 
legal tool to fight disclosure, stall ex-
posure, and protect the clandestine na-
ture of its covert political operations. 
Remember what I said, job one? This 
is job one. This is the dark money 
apparatus’s pearl beyond price, and the 
Court—at least the Republicans on the 
Court—delivered. 
And it is notable that this dark 
money-funded operation that just got 
this big and novel win had a big hand 
in putting the last three Justices on 
the Court. Much of how they did it is 
hidden behind dark money screens, but 
what we do know is chilling. 
The Federalist Society took in tens 
of millions of dollars in dark money 
while it was being used as the private 
political turnstile to control who got 
nominated to the Court. The Judicial 
Crisis Network took dark money dona-
tions, some as big as $17 million, to 
fund ad campaigns for the nominees se-
lected by the Federalist Society’s spe-
cial interest turnstile to get them con-
firmed to the Court. Who writes a $17 
million check for that? 
And, of course, floods of dark money 
poured into the Republican Party as 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
smashed 
and 
crashed his way through any rule, any 
precedent, or any practice of the Sen-
ate that stood in the confirmation path 
of these dark money nominees. Truly, 
this Court is, today, the Supreme 
Court that dark money built, and it 
just delivered for the dark money in-
terests. 
The dark money link to the Repub-
lican Party brings us to the second 
case. This case, Brnovich v. DNC— 
Democratic National Committee—in-
volved voter suppression laws passed to 
discourage 
minorities 
from 
voting. 
Why would anybody want to do that? 
Because today’s Republican Party has 
settled on voter suppression as its path 
to power. Across the country, you see 
it. Republican-controlled legislatures 
have swiveled in unison to pass voter 
suppression laws in their States all at 
once, as if on signal. And guess what. 
Dark money groups have been caught 
taking credit for this coordinated swiv-
el, describing how they worked through 
local sentinels, describing how they 
drafted the legislation for the local Re-
publicans, and describing how they 
were able to do so surreptitiously. 
The voter suppression fixation of Re-
publicans in all these State legislative 
bodies is quite plainly a coordinated 
activity, and equally plainly it has the 
dark money apparatus behind it. 
Here is another example: After a 
Washington Post expose blew his cover, 
the operative at the center of the dark 
money Court-packing scheme vacated 
that role. The article was pretty tough. 
He got burned pretty good. So he fled. 
And where did he go? He moved 
straight from Court packing to voter 
suppression. 
Don’t worry, he didn’t have to go 
very far from his Court-packing roots. 
The group he went to is called, in fine 
Orwellian fashion, the Honest Elec-
tions Project. What is the Honest Elec-
tions Project? It is a corporate re-
branding of something called the Judi-
cial Education Project, which is, in 
turn, the corporate sibling of—yup, you 
guessed it—the Judicial Crisis Net-
work, the group that was getting the 
$17 million checks to run the Court- 
capture dark money advertising cam-
paigns. 
The 
former 
Court-packing 
group is the corporate kin of the hon-
est elections voter suppression group, 
and the same guy just hopped from the 
one to the other. 
The Washington Post expose, by the 
way, chronicled $250 million in funding 
for this dark money Court-capture op-
eration through its network of groups. 
So whoever is behind this, they are not 
playing around, and $250 million is an 
immense sum. 
So when Mr. Court Capture shows up 
as Mr. Voter Suppression in a repaint 
of one of his Court capture vehicles, 
you can guess that his voter suppres-
sion effort will have plenty of dark 
money too. 
So with this as the background, the 
Republicans on the Court served up yet 
another blow to the Voting Rights Act. 
They allowed States to pass even more 
voter suppression laws. They allowed 
them to pass even voting laws conceded 
to impede minority voting. The pur-
pose of the Voting Rights Act is to pro-
tect voters’ rights to the polls and par-
ticularly minority voters’ rights to the 
polls because of decades of discrimina-
tion and suppression that kept minor-
ity voters away from the polls. 
In this case, they said: No, it is OK. 
If the decision is conceded to fall un-
fairly on minority voters, still good. 
The author of this partisan majority 
decision, even for good measure, threw 
in the totally unsupported and perhaps 
even fraudulent Republican political 
talking point that voter fraud is pres-
ently a big hazard demanding our at-
tention. 
So it was a very big week of very big 
rewards for a very big dark money ap-
paratus. When those two decisions 
came down, the upshot was simple. The 
dark money apparatus that put the last 
three Justices on the Court desperately 
needs dark money to function. And the 
Court that dark money built just built 
dark money a new home in our Con-
stitution. And the dark money appa-
ratus that put the last three Justices 
on the Supreme Court desperately 
needs Republicans to win elections to 
work its political will, and the No. 1 
Republican strategy going into 2022 is 
voter suppression. And the Court that 
dark money built just kicked into the 
Voting Rights Act another hole allow-
ing more voter suppression. 
It has been said that these Justices 
up on the Supreme Court are there just 
calling balls and strikes. Yeah, right. 
They are not just calling balls and 
strikes. In case after case, over and 
over, in a consistent and predictable 
pattern, they are changing the shape of 
the ballfield. They are tilting the ball-
field steeply to help one side, and they 
are doing grave damage to important 
safeguards of democracy in the process. 
These two cases, ignoring precedent 
and delivering big political wins to the 
dark money apparatus through a par-
tisan Republican majority, show the 
game in play and the Republican Jus-
tices as players. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise today to once again call for every 
Senator to have the opportunity to 
consider and cast their vote for the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. 
The bill would remove all serious 
crimes 
except 
for 
military-specific 
crimes out of the chain of command 
and give it to trained military prosecu-
tors to decide whether or not to move 
that case to trial. Making that change 
would end days of asking commanders, 
who are not trained lawyers, to make 
complex legal decisions in cases where 
they often know both the accuser and 
the accused. That change is necessary. 
It is necessary because the current 
military justice system is simply not 
delivering justice, especially not to 
servicemembers of color. 
I am proud that our legislation has 
recently won the endorsement of our 
colleagues in the Congressional Black 
Caucus, who have highlighted how this 
reform would address the systemic bar-
riers to justice our servicemembers of 
color face. I want to thank the CBC for 
their strong support. I share their ur-
gency when it comes to addressing 
those systemic injustices. 
Right now, Black servicemembers are 
up to 2.61 times as likely to face dis-
ciplinary action as their fellow White 
servicemembers, and Black and His-
panic servicemembers are more likely 
than White servicemembers to be tried 
in general and special courts-martial 
across the military services. 
The Joint Service Committee on 
Military Justice began collecting data 
on race and courts-martial last June. 
Even in the brief period of time they 
have tracked, the disparities are trag-
ically clear. In the Army, just 21.4 per-
cent of Active-Duty servicemembers 
are Black, but Black servicemembers 
account for 35.5 percent of the accused 
in general courts-martial. In the Air 
Force, just 14.7 percent of Active-Duty 
servicemembers are Black, but they ac-
count for 23.1 percent of the accused. In 
the Navy, 17.2 percent of Active-Duty 
servicemembers are Black, but they ac-
count for 34.3 percent of the accused. 
Those figures speak to an inherent bias 
in the system that must be addressed. 
Congressman ANTHONY BROWN, who 
served in the military for 30 years and 
worked as an Army judge advocate 
general and as a clerk for then-Chief 
Judge Eugene Sullivan at the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, 
recently wrote in the Washington Post 
about the need to pass this legislation. 
He wrote: 
Following the police killings of George 
Floyd, Breonna Taylor and too many more 
Black and Brown Americans, there has been 
a nationwide call to address the disparities 
in our criminal justice system. But these ef-
forts cannot overlook the criminal justice 
system that is not on the front pages or in 
[the] television news—[that is] the one in 
[the U.S.] military. The current military jus-
tice system is not serving our country’s 
higher values of justice, equity and fairness. 
It has put servicemembers of color at a dis-
advantage and left them subject to a com-
mander-controlled system they do not trust. 
In a survey last year of members of the Air 
Force and [in the] Space Force, 3 in 5 Black 
servicemembers said they would not receive 
the same benefit of the doubt as their White 
peers if they faced disciplinary action. One- 
third believed the military justice system is 
actively biased against them. 
Those fears are corroborated by the facts. 
. . . Our military justice system mirrors the 
discrimination in the civilian criminal jus-
tice system, sometimes rising to a life-or- 
death matter. A 2012 study showed that, be-
fore its last use decades ago, nearly two- 
thirds of servicemembers sentenced to death 
were servicemembers of color. These long- 
standing disparities and this unjust system 
demand our attention and action. 
These disparities are longstanding. A 
task force established by President 
Nixon’s Secretary of Defense in 1972 
identified many of the same issues and 
same causal factors we see today. The 
task force reported: 
In the course of our conversations with 
black and Spanish-speaking [servicemem-
bers] throughout the world, we became con-
vinced that the black or Spanish-speaking 
enlisted man is often singled out for punish-
ment by white authority figures where his 
white counterpart is not. There is enough 
evidence of intentional discrimination by in-
dividuals to convince the Task Force that 
such selective punishment is in many cases 
racially motivated. 
I know that some of my colleagues 
have called for more time to study this 
issue. I would point them to a 2020 re-
view from the Air Force inspector gen-
eral, which found that for every year 
between 1999 and 2019, Black airmen 
were 60 percent more likely to face 
court-martial and 74 percent more like-
ly to receive nonjudicial punishment 
from their commanders than their 
White counterparts. That is 20 years of 
data telling the same unacceptable 
story. What more proof do they need? 
It has been nearly 50 years since the 
Nixon 
administration’s 
task 
force 
brought this issue to light, and we have 
seen little positive change. Our service-
members cannot wait any longer. Con-
gressman BROWN is right—this unjust 
system demands our attention and ac-
tion. 
As Members of Congress, we have the 
constitutional duty to provide over-
sight and accountability over the De-
partment of Defense. We have the job 
of writing and revising and improving 
the military code of justice. It is a con-
gressionally created code. Addressing 
these disparities is our responsibility 
and no one else’s. This bill will help us 
do that. Now is the time to act. 
In addition to the Congressional 
Black Caucus, this bill is supported by 
legal experts and servicemembers. It 
has the support of almost every vet-
eran group I can find, from the Iraq 
and Afghanistan veterans group to the 
Vietnam veterans group, to the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars. This is sup-
ported by our servicemembers and our 
veterans. 
It also has the support of a growing 
number of bipartisan Congress Mem-
bers in the House. It also has the sup-
port of 66 U.S. Senators—a filibuster- 
proof majority. If the vote were called 
today, it would pass. This bill should 
be voted on. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader in consultation 
with the Republican leader, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of

AWARDING AND CELEBRATING 
MEC’S FIBER-OPTIC PROJECT 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the first Mohave Electric member 
connections for MEC’s fiber-optic project and 
broadband service. In a first-of-its-kind en-
deavor for an electric co-op in Arizona, MEC 
is building a fiber-optic network to enhance 
electric 
operations 
and 
provide 
reliable 
broadband service for each member in MEC’s 
service territory which consists of 33,000 
members and 42,000 end points. 
MEC was created in 1946 by local residents 
who took initiative to provide themselves with 
electricity investor-owned utilities refused to 
supply. MEC crews have now already installed 
more than 190,000 feet of fiber line, increasing 
that number every day. The work the MEC is 
producing for reliable internet is very important 
because it helps small businesses, local emer-
gency responders, and hospitals to be able to 
do their job and help the people of Mohave 
County. 
Madam Speaker, I express a sincere form 
of gratitude to MEC, and I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating a successful 
project and legacy as a valuable organization 
to the people of Arizona. These notable efforts 
and accomplishments to provide reliable 
broadband service should be recognized and 
acknowledged. For these reasons I stand with 
MEC for their remarkable impact on the Mo-
have County communities.

RECOGNIZING DR. WAYNE 
CALHOUN TEMPLE 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Wayne 
Calhoun Temple for his distinguished service 
to the State of Illinois and the American peo-
ple. 
Wayne was born on his family farm in Dela-
ware County, Ohio. Until eighth grade he 
worked on the farm and attended a one room 
schoolhouse a mile from his home. He went 
on to graduate as valedictorian of Prospect 
High School and earned a football scholarship 
to Ohio State University. 
He attended college for only two quarters 
before answering the call to serve in the U.S. 
Army during World War II. He was sent to the 
University of Illinois to study engineering and 
was later assigned to an Army communica-
tions service-plant engineering agency. While 
overseas, he was responsible for authoring 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s communica-
tions and was awarded the Bronze Star for his 
work at the Rhine River. 
Following World War II, Wayne attended the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 
1946, where he graduated with honors in engi-
neering and received a PhD in history. During 
his time at the University of Illinois he served 
as a research assistant to ‘‘The Dean of Lin-
coln Scholars’’ Professor James G. Randall 
and contributed to Professor Randall’s writing 
of four books. 
Throughout his life, Wayne has authored 
over 600 works on the life of President Abra-
ham Lincoln. In 1964, he moved to Springfield 
to work in the Illinois State Archives depository 
of public records and served as both the Chief 
Deputy Director and Acting Director of the de-
pository. 
His dedication to serve and educate others 
is evident through his life’s work and I would 
like to personally thank him for his continued 
service to the State of Illinois.

HONORING GERTRUDE JACKSON’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 100th birthday of 
Gertrude Jackson. Born on May 2nd, 1921, 
Mrs. Jackson grew up in Prichard, Alabama 
and left her hometown to pursue a nursing de-
gree at Saint Mary’s Nursing School in St. 
Louis, Missouri. She graduated and became a 
registered nurse in 1944 and moved to settle 
in Sacramento, California. Mrs. Jackson also 
served in the U.S. Army in WWII as Second 
Lieutenant Gertrude Clarke. After she moved 
to Sacramento and finished her time in the 
Army, she met her late husband and was mar-
ried the following year on May 15th. Mr. and 
Mrs. Jackson spent a wonderful 70 years to-
gether. 
Mrs. Jackson is a very accomplished 
woman, and her children, grandchildren, and 
greatgrandchildren all look up to her. As she 
began her career in nursing in 1944, she was 
the second African-American registered nurse 
in Sacramento, working at Sutter Memorial 
Hospital. This achievement helped pave the 
way for women of color in the health care sec-
tor, and our community is grateful for her serv-
ice. 
Although her 100th birthday was earlier this 
year, we continue to celebrate this milestone 
as she reunites with her family for the first 
time since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic. Mrs. Jackson celebrated her birth-
day at Elk Grove Regional Park last weekend, 
and we wish her well this year. I ask that my 
colleagues join me in wishing a happy birthday 
to Mrs. Jackson and a profound thank you for 
her work in our community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
BUREAU 
OF 
PRISONS 
VOTING 
ASSISTANCE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Voting Assistance Act with Congresswoman 
CHELLIE PINGREE and Congressman PETER 
WELCH. This bill would require the Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons (BOP) to provide to inmates 
from jurisdictions that allow inmates to vote, 
like the District of Columbia, Vermont and 
Maine, information on how to register to vote 
and request an absentee ballot. It would re-
quire BOP to provide each BOP prison infor-
mation on the criteria for voter registration, in-
structions on voter registration, voter registra-
tion forms and prepaid envelopes for voter 
registration forms, if provided by the state gen-
erally. Each prison would be required to post 
the information in the facility and give it to 
each inmate eligible to vote. 
These are essentially the practices BOP 
used in the most recent presidential election, 
so this bill would codify an already successful 
practice of assisting with voter enfranchise-
ment. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
SAN 
BERNARDINO 
COUNTY SHERIFF JOHN MCMA-
HON ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Sheriff-Coroner John McMahon 
of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment in California’s 8th Congressional District. 
Sheriff McMahon has served as a law enforce-
ment officer in San Bernardino County for the 
past 36 years. He began his career in 1985 as 
a patrol deputy at the Needles station in Cali-
fornia’s 8th District and has been promoted to 
every rank in the department since then, serv-
ing at a total of 15 stations during his career. 
In 2014, John was elected as the 35th Sheriff- 
Coroner of the San Bernardino County Sher-
iff’s Department, and his leadership has been 
an invaluable asset to our law enforcement 
community. 
During his tenure, Sheriff McMahon suc-
cessfully led the department through many 
challenging times and high-profile incidents, 
including the December 2nd terror attack in 
San Bernardino. Long-term solutions imple-
mented by his department have helped to 
keep crime down in our communities and im-
prove safety across the largest county in our 
state. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
San 
Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department has 
become known as one of the premier law en-
forcement agencies in the nation. I wish Sher-
iff McMahon and his wife Shelly all the best as 
he begins his retirement and I thank him for 
his dedication to serving the people of San 
Bernardino County.

THANKING ANDREW LOFTON FOR 
A LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
AND CONGRATULATING HIM ON 
RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Andrew Lofton’s out-
standing career with the Seattle Housing Au-
thority and congratulate him on a well-earned 
retirement after nearly five decades in public 
service. 
Over the course of his astonishing career, 
Mr. Lofton held a variety of titles including 
Chief of Staff to Mayor Norm Rice, Budget Di-
rector of the City of Seattle, Chief of Depart-
mental Operations for the City of Seattle, and 
most recently, the Executive Director of Se-
attle Housing Authority. 
The positive impact Andrew has made on 
his community cannot be stressed enough. 
Seattle is without a doubt better because of 
his hard work, dedication, and passion for de-
veloping affordable housing. Under his leader-
ship as Executive Director, the Seattle Hous-
ing Authority grew by over 1,500 units making 
a world of difference for over 3,000 children 
and adults. He grew the Seattle Housing Au-
thority to the largest it has ever been, serving 
over 37,000 Seattle residents in over 8,400 
units. 
In a career full of achievements, one that 
stands out is his role in organizing and leading 
the community of Moving to Work Housing Au-
thorities and serving as the first President of 
the Moving to Work Collaborative. This work 
was absolutely critical in piloting a new ap-
proach to more effectively and efficiently using 
Federal housing resources to serve low in-
come communities. Moving to Work agencies 
assist families with children where the head of 
the household is seeking work or participating 
in a workforce development program. Not only 
do they help these families become economi-
cally stable, but they also increase housing 
choices for low-income families. Because of 
Andrew’s dedication, these programs remain 
successful in Washington and across the 
country. 
Andrew was also pivotal in the Community 
Moves to Opportunity initiative. This partner-
ship between Seattle Housing Authority, King 
County Housing Authority, and Raj Chetty’s 
Opportunity Insights research team at Harvard 
paved the way to broaden geographic choice 
and access to opportunity neighborhoods for 
low-income families. This work has been 
foundational for new national mobility efforts 
funded by Congress and currently being rolled 
out by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure to 
congratulate Andrew Lofton on a distinguished 
career. The State of Washington is lucky to 
have had him working for its people and after 
47 years of service he always worked with 
grace, a generosity of spirit, and a never-fail-
ing sense of humor.

RECOGNIZING POLICE CHIEF MATT 
BURNS 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Police Chief Matt Burns for his 25 years of 
service with the Sioux Falls Police Depart-
ment. 
Chief Burns’ career with the Sioux Falls Po-
lice Department began in 1996 as a patrol offi-
cer. He later went on to serve as a SWAT 
team member, detective, lieutenant, and as-
sistant chief. In 2015, Burns became chief of 
police. 
During his honorable career, Burns has 
spearheaded several key initiatives including 
promoting, designing, and funding the New 
Public Safety Training Center and leading the 
effort to host remote Basic Certification Acad-
emy classes. 
Despite the many challenges the city of 
Sioux Falls has faced in recent years, I am 
grateful for Burns’ leadership in keeping the 
community of Sioux Falls safe. 
I commend Chief Burns for his outstanding 
record of service, hard work, and leadership. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to him on 
his well-earned retirement. 
IN HONOR OF NICKI CLARKE FOR 
HER 14 YEARS OF SERVICE AT 
CAPITOL CENTER FOR THE ARTS 
IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my sincere gratitude for Nicki Clarke 
as she moves on after fourteen years from her 
role as Executive Director of the Capitol Cen-
ter for the Arts. 
Over the span of Nicki’s long and successful 
career, she has built a lasting memory as a 
leader and advocate for the arts in New 
Hampshire. Nicki has brought numerous rich 
and diverse art experiences to Granite Staters. 
Her leadership over the past fourteen years 
has been dynamic, innovative, and focused as 
she increased the number of shows and cre-
ated the Bank of New Hampshire Stage. Her 
commitment to the theater and the community 
has touched the lives of so many in New 
Hampshire. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District and all those who have 
benefitted from Nicki’s work, I thank her for 
her incredible service and congratulate her on 
all that she has accomplished. I wish her the 
best of luck in the years ahead, and I look for-
ward to our continued work together to make 
New Hampshire an even better place to live, 
work, and raise a family.

COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNI-

OF 
PATRICK 
HENRY 
COLLEGE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor a great institution of 
higher education, Patrick Henry College, on 
the occasion of its 20th anniversary. 
Through a commitment to high academic 
rigor, a fidelity to the spirit of the American 
founding, 
and 
an 
unwavering 
worldview 
grounded in biblical principles, Patrick Henry 
College has attracted excellent students from 
all 50 states and distinguished itself by form-
ing alumni marked by their grace, humility, 
and wisdom. 
Since its founding in 2000, Patrick Henry 
College has placed graduates in the White 
House and as clerks for four U.S. Supreme 
Court justices. Many alumni can be found 
leading in various roles of public service and 
helping to make our country and the world a 
better place. 
It has captured 12 national moot court 
championships, the Nelson Mandela world 
championship, and last year was crowned na-
tional civic debate champion. 
The United States of America is a better 
place because of the work of its alumni in the 
public square. I want to honor Michael Farris 
for having the vision and determination to 
plant Patrick Henry College for the purpose of 
educating future leaders and equipping them 
to have a strong Christian influence in their 
communities and the culture at large. I am

IN RECOGNITION OF AYA’S 
SWEETS 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the culmination of hard work and 
dedication by Aya Islim and her family that 
has resulted in the grand opening of Aya’s 
Sweets, a shop and bakery in the Dearborn 
Heights community in Michigan’s 13th Con-

Small businesses are the life blood of our 
economy, contributing to local economies and 
fostering a sense of community. But, what 
truly makes the grand opening of Aya’s 
Sweets shine is that it is the realization of a 
dream. Aya, at the age of sixteen, and with 
the support of her family, has committed so 
much of herself into seeing this business suc-
ceed. 
Mostly self-taught, Aya began baking at the 
age of nine by watching cooking videos and 
shows. She has never shied away from a 
challenge. As she honed her skills, she 
earned a reputation for her beautiful and tasty 
creations, and has taken the step of opening 
her own bakery. 
Please join me in recognizing and cele-
brating Aya and the lslim Family on the occa-
sion of the grand opening of Aya’s Sweets. 
We wish them many years of success in serv-
ice to our neighbors in Michigan’s #13th Dis-
trict Strong.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
MAYOR 
DAVID 
CARETTO ON THE OCCASION OF 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
AS 
THE 
MAYOR OF BIG BEAR LAKE 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mayor David Caretto, a con-
stituent of my district and Mayor of my home-
town of Big Bear Lake, California. Mayor 
Carreto served Big Bear Lake for eleven 
years, but he was a public servant long before 
that, serving Southern California for thirty- 
three years as General Manager and Sec-
retary for the South Orange County Waste-
water Authority, Assistant City Manager and 
City Clerk for the City of Irwindale, Assistant 
City Manager and City Clerk for the City of 
Pico Rivera, City Manager and Assistant City 
Manager for the City of Signal Hill, and Plan-
ning Technician for the City of Lynwood. In 
addition to his own public service, David and 
his wife Cindy raised two talented children, 
both of whom proudly served their country in 
the Iraq War. 
I was honored to serve alongside David on 
the Big Bear Lake City Council, and I can re-
late from firsthand experience how impactful 
his continuous dedication to our community 
has been. I wish him and Cindy all the best in 
his retirement as they enter the next phase of 
their life. Thankyou very much, Dave, for your 
service to the City of Big Bear Lake.

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
PETER 
B. 
ANDRYSIAK JR. 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I am deeply 
honored to express my gratitude to Major 
General Peter B. Andrysiak Jr. for his years of 
dedicated service to the United States of 
America, the Army, and the great state of 
Alaska. 
As the Commanding General of United 
States Army Alaska (USARAK.) and Deputy 
Commanding General of the Alaskan Com-
mand, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, 
Alaska, he is responsible for providing trained 
and ready forces to support worldwide unified 
land operations and operations in the United 
States Indo-Pacific Command Area of Oper-
ations and the Arctic Region and conduct mili-
tary operations in places like Iraq and Afghani-
stan. 
Additionally, General Andrysiak has become 
a leader for the U.S. Army in the Arctic. In 
1935, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell stated, ‘‘I 
believe that in the future, whoever holds Alas-
ka will hold the world. I think it is the most im-
portant strategic place in the world.’’ In the 
over 85 years since that statement, we have 
seen military leaders who understood it and 
many who ignored it. General Andrysiak is 
clearly the former. His Arctic leadership was 
not only critical to reshaping the Army’s vision 
of the Arctic but was also crucial in the devel-
opment of the Army’s Arctic Strategy and the 
modernization of the Army’s operations in Arc-
tic environments. 
Since pinning on his Second Lieutenant 
bars following his graduation from the United 
States Military Academy at West Point, Gen-
eral Andrysiak has exemplified what it means 
to be an American soldier. He is, however, 
more than the military tactical and operational 
expertise that he has demonstrated through 
his career. General Andrysiak has endeared 
himself to the soldiers and their families under 
his charge. For he has become a tireless ad-
vocate for their quality of life and wellbeing. 
From investments and improvements to facili-
ties such as Child Development Centers, bar-
racks, and gyms, to leadership engagement 
and mental health support, General Andrysiak 
understands that there is more to a soldier’s 
readiness than squeezing a trigger and field 
maneuvers. There is mental, spiritual, phys-
ical, and family readiness that must be ad-
dressed as well. 
On February 23, 2021, the Chief of Staff of 
the Army, General James McConville, an-
nounced that General Andrysiak will become 
the Deputy Commanding General of U.S. 
Army Europe-Africa. While I am saddened to 
see him leave Alaska, I am proud that he will 
continue serving as a sentinel for our Nation.

REMEMBERING JOHN D. LEONARD 
SR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 13, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John D. Leonard Sr. of Gi-
rard, Ohio who passed away peacefully Mon-
day, July 5, 2021 at the age of 80 surrounded 
by his loving family. 
John was born Oct. 13, 1940, in Niles, a 
son to Joseph and Kathryn McMenamy Leon-
ard. He was a 1958 graduate of Niles McKin-
ley High School. He worked as a skilled 
tradesman for both the union and then Pack-
ard Electric, retiring in 2008. John was a pa-
rishioner of St. Rose Church and was a mem-
ber of the Knights of Columbus in Girard. 
John was a pillar to his family. He was a 
selfless provider always ensuring the pros-
perity of his children and grandchildren. Just 
as he sang along to Louise’s piano perform-
ances, uplifting her tunes, John would always 
uplift those around him, supporting friends and 
family unconditionally. His infectious smile and 
enthusiastic dancing reminds us how to live 
life. John’s fundamental values of love, dedi-
cation, and community will forever guide his 
loved one’s path towards happiness. We have 
lost a truly wonderful person who will forever 
be missed. 
He leaves to cherish his memory, his chil-
dren, Karla (Philip) Smith of Virginia, John D. 
(Suzana) Leonard Jr. of Shaker Heights and 
Bob (Danielle) Leonard of Rocky River; broth-
ers, Joseph (MaryAnn), Thomas (Lucy), Paul 
(Charlotte), 
William 
(Mary 
Ann), 
Richard 
(Sandy) and Robert; sisters, Kathleen, Mar-
garet Mary (David); close friend and com-
panion, Nancy Foster; and his grandchildren, 
Audrey and Emma Smith, Daniel and Stefan 
Leonard, Andrew and Anna Leonard, Alex 
Sapp, Adam (Janice) and Hannah Smith. Be-
sides his parents, John was preceded in death 
by his wife, Louise Leonard, whom he married 
Aug. 18, 1962, and who passed away Feb. 2, 
2015; and a brother, Jerry. 
John was the uncle to my longtime District 
Director and childhood friend, Rick Leonard. 
John truly embodied the spirit of the Demo-
cratic Party through his lifetime of integrity and 
kindness and was all around a wonderful per-
son to be around. My condolences go out to 
all whose lives he touched.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E756 
July 13, 2021 
on a well-earned retirement and thank him for 
nearly two decades of service to the Tacoma 
Housing Authority. 
The positive impact Michael has had on his 
community cannot be overstated. He has dili-
gently served as Executive Director of Tacoma 
Housing Authority for the last 17 years, where 
in that time he helped countless people and 
substantially improved the Tacoma Housing 
Authority by growing the number of units and 
increasing the reach of their services. Prior to 
this role, Michael was a highly successful liti-
gator who represented homeless families and 
poor neighborhoods in several high-profile 
legal cases. 
Under Michael’s leadership, the Tacoma 
Housing Authority completed a reconstruction 
project of 200 urban acres costing $250 mil-
lion in Tacoma’s Salishan neighborhood. Not 
only was this the largest project in Tacoma’s 
history, but also the largest West of the Mis-
sissippi. The project increased the total num-
ber of units under the Tacoma Housing Au-
thority by 29 percent. 
Michael also spearheaded innovative ways 
to use federal housing dollars to further benefit 
families. With the Education Project, Michael 
was able to help the children of families work-
ing with the Tacoma Housing Authority suc-
ceed in public schools and pay for the college 
education of students experiencing homeless-
ness. Michael was instrumental in finding new 
ways to use funds and enlisted local devel-
opers to incorporate low-income housing into 
market-rate developments. 
He also established the Tacoma Housing 
Authority as a Moving to Work agency, be-
coming just one of 39 in the country. Moving 
to Work agencies are given the flexibility to 
test innovative, locally designed strategies to 
use federal resources more efficiently and 
help residents find employment to become fi-
nancially stable in the long-term. This work 
was absolutely critical in piloting a new ap-
proach to more effectively and efficiently using 
Federal housing resources to serve low in-
come communities. Not only do they help 
these families become economically stable, 
but they also increase housing options for low- 
income families. In 2016, in recognition of his 
distinguished career, Michael was awarded 
the Margaret M. Sevy Lifetime Achievement 
Award by the Washington State Housing Fi-
nance Commission. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
honor Michael Mirra on an outstanding career 
in public service, thank him for serving his 
community so well, and congratulate him on 
retiring.
