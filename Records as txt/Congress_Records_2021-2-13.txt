f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will begin as a Court of Im-
peachment. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O Lord, our God, yesterday this 
Chamber reverberated to a standing 
ovation for the courage of Officer Eu-
gene Goodman in defending this build-
ing and human life. May our legislative 
jurors strive to emulate his courage in 
their defense of the United States Con-
stitution. Lord, touch and move them 
to believe that the end does not justify 
the means. Help them to remember 
that the end is inherent and built into 
the means. Fill our Senators with the 
spirit that combines common sense 
with 
commitment, 
conscience, 
and 
courage. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ators, please be seated. 
If there is no objection, the Journal 
of proceedings of the trial are approved 
to date. 
And I would ask the Sergeant at 
Arms to make the proclamation. 
The Acting Sergeant at Arms, Jen-
nifer A. Hemingway, made the procla-
mation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are com-
manded to keep silence, on pain of imprison-
ment, while the Senate of the United States 
is sitting for the trial of the Article of Im-
peachment exhibited by the House of Rep-
resentatives against Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, 
the Senate has provided up to 2 hours 
of argument by the parties, equally di-
vided, on the question of whether or 
not it shall be in order to consider and 
debate under the impeachment rules 
any motion to subpoena witnesses or 
documents. 
Are both parties ready to proceed at 
this point? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Yes, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. We have a mo-
tion. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. They 
may proceed. 
MOTION TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
Good morning, Senators. 
Over the last several days, we have 
presented overwhelming evidence that 
establishes the charges in the Article 
of Impeachments. We have shown you 
how President Trump created a powder 
keg, lit a match, and then continued 
his incitement, even as he failed to de-
fend us from the ensuing violence. 
We have supported our position with 
images, videos, affidavits, documents, 
tweets, and other evidence, leaving no 
doubt that the Senate should convict. 
We believe we have proven our case. 
But 
last 
night, 
Congresswoman 
JAIME
HERRERA
BEUTLER
of Wash-
ington State issued a statement con-
firming that in the middle of the insur-
rection, when House Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY called the President 
to beg for help, President Trump re-
sponded: 
Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more 
upset about the election than you are. 
Needless to say, this is an additional 
critical piece of corroborating evi-
dence, further confirming the charges 
before you, as well as the President’s 
willful dereliction of duty and deser-
tion of duty as Commander in Chief of 
the United States, his state of mind, 
and his further incitement of the insur-
rection on January 6. 
For that reason, and because this is 
the proper time to do so under the res-
olution that the Senate adopted to set 
the rules for the trial, we would like 
the opportunity to subpoena Congress-
woman HERRERA regarding her commu-
nications with House Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY and to subpoena her 
contemporaneous notes that she made 
regarding what President Trump told 
KEVIN MCCARTHY in the middle of the 
insurrection. 
We would be prepared to proceed by 
Zoom deposition of an hour or less just 
as soon as Congresswoman HERRERA 
BEUTLER is available and to then pro-
ceed to the next phase of the trial, in-
cluding the introduction of that testi-
mony shortly thereafter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S718 
February 13, 2021 
Congresswoman 
BEUTLER
further 
stated that she hopes other witnesses 
to this part of the story—other patri-
ots, as she put it—would come forward. 
And if that happens, we would seek the 
opportunity to take their depositions 
via Zoom, also for less than an hour, or 
to subpoena other relevant documents 
as well. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Mr. 
President, thank you. 
Senators, good morning, and good 
morning to the American people. 
The first thing I want to say on the 
issue of witnesses is that the House 
manager just got up here and described 
the Articles of Impeachment and the 
charges. There is no plural here. That 
is wrong. There is one Article of Im-
peachment, and there is one charge, 
and that is incitement of violence and 
insurrection. 
What you all need to know and the 
American people need to know is, as of 
late yesterday afternoon, there was a 
stipulation going around that there 
weren’t going to be any witnesses. But 
after what happened here in this Cham-
ber yesterday, the House managers re-
alized they did not investigate this 
case before bringing the impeachment. 
They did not give the proper consider-
ation and work. They didn’t put the 
work in that was necessary to impeach 
the former President. But if they want 
to have witnesses, I am going to need 
at least over 100 depositions, not just 1. 
The real issue is incitement. They 
put into their case over 100 witnesses, 
people who have been charged with 
crimes by the Federal Government, and 
each one of those, they said that Mr. 
Trump was a coconspirator with. That 
is not true, but I have the right to de-
fend that. 
The only thing that I ask, if you vote 
for witnesses, do not handcuff me by 
limiting the number of witnesses that I 
can have. I need to do a thorough in-
vestigation that they did not do. I need 
to do the 911-style investigation that 
NANCY PELOSI called for. It should have 
been done already. It is a dereliction of 
the House managers’ duty that they 
didn’t. 
And now, at the last minute, after a 
stipulation 
had 
apparently 
been 
worked out, they want to go back on 
that. I think that is inappropriate and 
improper. We should close this case out 
today. We have each prepared our clos-
ing arguments. We each—I mean, I had 
8 days to get ready for this thing, but 
we each had those 8 days equally, to-
gether, to prepare ourselves. And the 
House managers need to live with the 
case that they brought. But if they 
don’t, please, in all fairness and in all 
due process, do not limit my ability to 
discover, discover, discover the truth. 
That would be another sham. 
And that is the President’s position, 
my position. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
First of all, this is the proper time 
that we were assigned to talk about 
witnesses. This is completely within 
the course of the rules set forth by the 
Senate. There is nothing remotely un-
usual about this. 
I think we have done an exceedingly 
thorough and comprehensive job with 
all the evidence that was available. 
Last night, this was breaking news, 
and it responded directly to a question 
that was being raised by the Presi-
dent’s defense counsel, saying that we 
had not sufficiently proven to their 
satisfaction—although I think we have 
proven to the satisfaction of the Amer-
ican people, certainly—that the Presi-
dent, after the breach and invasion 
took place, was not working on the 
side of defending the Capitol but, rath-
er, was continuing to pursue his polit-
ical goals. 
And the information that came out 
last night by Congresswoman BEUTLER, 
apparently backed up by contempora-
neous notes that she had taken, I 
think, will put to rest any lingering 
doubts raised by the President’s coun-
sel, who now says he wants to inter-
view hundreds of people. 
There is only one person the Presi-
dent’s counsel really needs to inter-
view, and that is their own client, and 
bring him forward, as we suggested last 
week, because a lot of this is matters 
that are in his head. Why did he not act 
to defend the country after he learned 
of the attack? Why was he continuing 
to press the political case? 
But this piece of evidence is relevant 
to that. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. If I 
may? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Finally, I 
wasn’t—I was a little bit mystified by 
the point about the Article of Impeach-
ment, which I referred to. The derelic-
tion of duty, the desertion of duty, is 
built into the incitement charge, obvi-
ously. 
If the President of the United States 
is out inciting a violent insurrection, 
he is, obviously, not doing his job at 
the same time. Just like, if a police of-
ficer is mugging you, yeah, he is guilty 
of theft and armed robbery, whatever it 
might be, but he is also not doing his 
job as a police officer. So it is further 
evidence of his intent and what his 
conduct is. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. If I 
may? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. First 
of all, it is my understanding it has 
been reported that Mr. MCCARTHY dis-
claims the rumors that have been the 
basis of this morning’s antics but, real-
ly, the rumors that have been the basis 
of this entire proceeding. 
This entire proceeding is based on 
rumor, report, innuendo. There is noth-
ing to it, and they didn’t do their work. 
Just like what happened with Mr. 
LEE 2 or 3 nights ago, some supposed 
conversation that happened, and they 
had to withdraw that. They had to 
back off of that because it was false. It 
was a false narrative. 
But it is one Article of Impeachment. 
Yeah, they threw a lot of stuff in it in 
violation of rule XXIII. Rule XXIII 
says you cannot combine counts. It is a 
defect in their entire case. It is one of 
the four reasons why you can vote to 
acquit in this case: jurisdiction, rule 
XXIII, due process, and the First 
Amendment. They all apply in this 
case. 
Let me take my own advice and cool 
the temperature in the room a little 
bit. 
It is about the incitement. It is not 
about what happened afterwards. That 
is actually the irrelevant stuff. That is 
the irrelevant stuff. It is not the things 
that were said from the election to 
January 6. It is not relevant to the 
legal analysis of the issues that are be-
fore this body. 
It doesn’t matter what happened 
after the insurgence into the Capitol 
Building because that doesn’t have to 
do with incitement. Incitement is—it is 
a point in time, folks. It is a point in 
time when the words are spoken, and 
the words say, implicitly say, explic-
itly say ‘‘commit acts of violence or 
lawlessness.’’ And we don’t have that 
here. 
So for the House managers to say we 
need depositions about things that hap-
pened after, it is just not true. But— 
but if he does, there are a lot of deposi-
tions that need to be happening. NANCY 
PELOSI’s deposition needs to be taken. 
Vice President Harris’s deposition ab-
solutely needs to be taken, and not by 
Zoom. None of these depositions should 
be done by Zoom. We didn’t do this 
hearing by Zoom. These depositions 
should be done in person, in my office, 
in Philadelphia. That is where they 
should be done. 
(Laughter.) 
I don’t know how many civil lawyers 
are here, but that is the way it works, 
folks. When you want somebody’s depo-
sition, you send a notice of deposition, 
and they appear at the place where the 
notice says. That is civil process. 
I don’t know why you are laughing. 
It is civil process. That is the way law-
yers do it. We send notices of deposi-
tion. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I 
would remind everybody that we will 
have order in the Chamber during these 
proceedings. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. I 
haven’t laughed at any of you, and 
there is nothing laughable here. He 
mentioned my client coming in to tes-
tify. That is not the way it is done. If 
he wanted to talk to Donald Trump, he 
should have put a subpoena down, like 
I am going to slap subpoenas on a good 
number of people if witnesses are what 
is required here for them to try to get 
their case back in order, which has 
failed miserably for four reasons: There 
is no jurisdiction here. There has been 
no due process here. They have com-
pletely 
violated 
and 
ignored 
and 
stepped on the Constitution of the

United States. They have trampled on 
it like people who have no respect for 
it. 
And if this is about nothing else, it 
has to be about the respect of our coun-
try, our Constitution, and all of the 
people that make it up. So that I ask, 
when considering or voting on this wit-
ness matter—and, to be clear, this may 
be the time to do it, but, again, every-
body needs to know—all of the back-
room politics, I am not so much into it 
all, and I am not too adept at it either. 
But there was a stipulation. They felt 
pretty comfortable after day 2, until 
their case was tested on day 3. 
Now is the time to end this. Now is 
the time to hear the closing argu-
ments. Now is the time to vote your 
conscience. Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
We were involved in no discussions 
about a stipulation, and I have no fur-
ther comment. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. I am 
going to require a deposition on that. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I 
would remind everybody, as Chief Jus-
tice Roberts noted on January 21, 2020, 
citing the trial of Charles Swain, 1905, 
all parties in this Chamber must re-
frain from using language that is not 
conducive to civil discourse. 
I listened to Chief Justice Roberts 
say that. I agreed with him. And I 
thought, for our colleagues, I would re-
peat it as I did last night.

Was that a vote on one witness or

sent that the Senate recess until 12:30

There being no objection, at 11:43

STIPULATION 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Senators, Don-
ald John Trump, by his counsel, is pre-
pared to stipulate that if Representa-
tive HERRERA BEUTLER were to testify 
under oath as part of these pro-
ceedings, her testimony would be con-
sistent with the statement she issued 
on February 12, 2021, and the former 
President’s counsel is agreeable to the 
admission of that public statement 
into evidence at this time. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
pro 
tempore. 
Thank you, Mr. Castor. 
Mr. RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
The managers are prepared to enter 
into the agreement. I will now read the 
statement. This is the statement of 
Congresswoman 
JAIME
HERRERA 
BEUTLER, February 12, 2021: 
In my January 12 statement in support of 
the article of impeachment, I referenced a 
conversation House Minority Leader Kevin 
McCarthy relayed to me that he had with 
President Trump while the January 6 attack 
was ongoing. Here are the details: 
When McCarthy finally reached the presi-
dent on January 6 and asked him to publicly 
and forcefully call off the riot, the president 
initially repeated the falsehood that it was 
antifa that had breached the Capitol. McCar-
thy refuted that and told the president that 
these were Trump supporters. That’s when, 
according to McCarthy, the president said: 
‘‘Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more 
upset about the election than you are.’’ 
Since I publicly announced my decision to 
vote for impeachment, I have shared these 
details in countless conversations with con-
stituents and colleagues, and multiple times 
through the media and other public forums. 
I told it to the Daily News of Longview on 
January 17. I’ve shared it with local county 
Republican executive board members, as well 
as other constituents who asked me to ex-
plain my vote. I shared it with thousands of 
residents on my telephone town hall on Feb-
ruary 8. 
Mr. President, I now move that the 
Senate admit the statement into evi-
dence. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there objection? 
Without objection, the statement 
will be admitted into evidence. 
And does either party wish to make 
any further motions related to wit-
nesses or documents at this time? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President, 
the President’s counsel have no further 
motions. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. And, Mr. 
President, we have no further motions 
either. 
ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Then 
the Chair would note that neither 
party wishes to make further motions 
under section 6 of S. Res. 47. Therefore,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S720 
February 13, 2021 
the next question is on admission of 
the evidence submitted by both parties 
pursuant to section 8 of the resolution. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, so 
now as we move to another matter, I 
am advised that the House managers 
have no objection to the admission of 
evidence proposed to be admitted by 
the former President’s counsel under 
the provisions of section 8 of S. Res. 47 
and that the President’s counsel have 
no objections to the evidence proposed 
to be admitted into evidence by the 
House managers. 
Pursuant to section 8 of the resolu-
tion, as agreed to by Leader MCCON-
NELL and myself a few days ago, both 
parties have made timely filings of this 
evidence with the Secretary of the Sen-
ate and have provided copies to each 
other. I, therefore, ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate dispense with the 
provisions of section 8(a) of S. Res. 47; 
and that the materials submitted by 
both parties be admitted into evidence 
subject to the provisions of section 8(c) 
of that resolution, which provides that 
the admission of this evidence does not 
constitute a concession by either party 
as to the truth of the matters asserted 
by the other party; and that each Sen-
ator shall decide for him or herself the 
weight to be given such evidence. This 
request has the approval of both par-
ties and the Republican leader. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
CLOSING ARGUMENTS 
Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 
47, the Senate has provided for up to 4 
hours in closing arguments. They will 
be equally divided between the man-
agers on the part of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the counsel for the 
former President. And pursuant to rule 
XXII of the Rules of Procedure and 
Practice in the Senate When Sitting on 
Impeachment Trials, the argument 
shall be opened and closed on the part 
of the House of Representatives. 
The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager 
RASKIN to begin the presentation on 
the part of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Mr. RASKIN, under rule XXII, you 
may reserve time if you wish. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
Members of the Senate, before I pro-
ceed, it was suggested by defense coun-
sel that Donald Trump’s conduct dur-
ing the attack, as described in Con-
gresswoman Beutler’s statement, is 
somehow not part of the constitutional 
offense for which former President 
Trump has been charged. I want to re-
ject that falsehood and that fallacy im-
mediately. 
After he knew that violence was un-
derway 
at 
the 
Capitol, 
President 
Trump took actions that further in-
cited the insurgence to be more in-
flamed and to take even more extreme, 
selective, and focused action against 
Vice President Mike Pence. 
Former President Trump also, as de-
scribed by Congresswoman Beutler’s 
notes, refused requests to publicly, im-
mediately, and forcefully call off the 
riots. And when he was told that the 
insurgents inside the Capitol were 
Trump supporters, the President said: 
Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more 
upset about the election than you are. 
Think about that for a second. This 
uncontradicted statement that has just 
been stipulated as part of the evi-
dentiary record, the President said: 
Well, Kevin, I guess these people— 
Meaning the mobsters, the insurrec-
tionists— 
are more upset about the election than you 
are. 
That conduct is obviously part and 
parcel of the constitutional offense 
that he was impeached for; namely, in-
citement to insurrection; that is, con-
tinuing incitement to the insurrection. 
The conduct described not only perpet-
uated his continuing offense but also 
provides to us here, today, further deci-
sive evidence of his intent to incite the 
insurrection in the first place. 
When my opposing counsel says that 
you should ignore the President’s ac-
tions after the insurrection began, that 
is plainly wrong, and it, of course, re-
flects the fact that they have no de-
fense to his outrageous, scandalous, 
and unconstitutional conduct in the 
middle of a violent assault on the Cap-
itol that he incited. 
Senators, think about it for a second. 
Say you light a fire, and you are 
charged with arson. And the defense 
counsel says: Everything I did after the 
fire started is irrelevant. And the court 
would reject that immediately and say: 
That is not true at all. It is extremely 
relevant to whether or not you com-
mitted the crime. If you run over and 
try to put out the flames, if you get 
lots of water and say, ‘‘Help, help, 
there is a fire,’’ and you call for help, 
a court will infer that—could infer that 
you didn’t intend for the fire to be lit 
in the first place. They would accept 
your defense, perhaps, that it was all 
an accident. It was all an accident. Ac-
cidents happen with fire. But if, on the 
other hand, when the fire erupts, you 
go and you pour more fuel on it, you 
stand by and you watch it, gleefully, 
any reasonable person will infer that 
you not only intended the fire to start 
but that once it got started and began 
to spread, you intended to continue to 
keep the fire going. And that is exactly 
where we are, my friends. 
Of course, your conduct, while a 
crime is ongoing, is relevant to your 
culpability, both to the continuation of 
the offense but also directly relevant, 
directly illuminating to what your pur-
pose was originally; what was your in-
tent? 
And any court in the land would 
laugh out any—would laugh out of 
court any criminal defendant who said: 
What I did after I allegedly killed that 
person is irrelevant to whether or not I 
intended to kill them. I mean, come on. 
Donald Trump’s refusal not only to 
send help but also to continue to fur-
ther incite the insurgence against his 
own Vice President—his own Vice 
President—provides 
further 
decisive 
evidence of both his intent to start this 
violent insurrection and his continued 
incitement once the attack had begun 
to override the Capitol. 
All right. Senators, that was in re-
sponse to this new evidentiary particle 
that came in. 
MANAGERS’ CLOSING ARGUMENTS 
But in my closing, I want to thank 
you for your remarkable attention and 
your seriousness of purpose befitting 
your office. 
We have offered you overwhelming 
and irrefutable and certainly unrefuted 
evidence that former President Trump 
incited this insurrection against us. 
To quote the statement Representa-
tive LIZ CHENEY made in January: 
On January 6, 2021, a violent mob attacked 
the United States Capitol to obstruct the 
process of our democracy and stop the count-
ing of presidential electoral votes. This in-
surrection caused injury, death and destruc-
tion in the most sacred space in our Repub-
lic. 
She continued—Representative CHE-
NEY continued: 
Much more will become clear in coming 
days and weeks, but what we know now is 
enough. The President of the United States 
summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and 
lit the flame of this attack. Everything that 
followed was his doing. None of this would 
have happened without the President. The 
President could have immediately and force-
fully intervened to stop the violence. He did 
not. There has never been a greater betrayal 
by the President of the United States of his 
office and his oath to the Constitution. 
I will vote to impeach the President. 
Representative CHENEY
was right. 
She based her vote on the facts, on the 
evidence, and on the Constitution. And 
the evidence—video, documentary, eye-
witness—has only grown stronger and 
stronger and more detailed right up to 
today, right up to 10 minutes ago, over 
the course of this Senate trial. 
And I have no doubt that you all no-
ticed that, despite the various propa-
ganda reels and so on, President 
Trump’s lawyers have said almost 
nothing to contest or overcome the ac-
tual 
evidence 
of 
former 
President 
Trump’s conduct that we presented, 
much less have they brought their cli-
ent forward to tell us his side of the 
story. 
We sent him a letter last week, which 
they rejected out of hand. The former 
President of the United States refused 
to come and tell us. And I ask any of 
you: If you were charged with inciting 
violent insurrection against our coun-
try and you were falsely accused, 
would you come and testify? I know I 
would. I would be there at 7 in the 
morning waiting for the doors to open. 
I am sure that is true of 100 Senators in 
this room. I hope it is true of 100 Sen-
ators in this room. 
The Senate was lectured several 
times yesterday about cancel culture. 
Well, not even 2 weeks ago the Presi-
dent’s most reliable supporters in the 
House—I am sorry; not the President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S721 
February 13, 2021 
The former President’s most reliable 
supporters in the House tried to cancel 
out Representative CHENEY because of 
her courageous and patriotic defense of 
the Republic and the truth and the 
Constitution. 
They tried to strip her of her leading 
role as chair of the House Republican 
Conference. But, you know what—I 
hope everybody takes a second to re-
flect on this—the conference rejected 
this plainly retaliatory and cowardly 
attempt to punish her for telling the 
truth to her constituents and her coun-
try in voting for impeachment. 
Who says you can’t stand up against 
bullies? Who says? In my mind, LIZ 
CHENEY is a hero for standing up for 
the truth and resisting this retaliatory 
cancel culture that she was subjected 
to. But she beat them on a vote of 145 
to 61, more than a 2-to-1 vote. 
You know, Ben Franklin, a great 
champion of the Enlightenment, an 
enemy of political fanaticism and cow-
ardice, and, of course, another great 
Philadelphian, once wrote this: I have 
observed that wrong is always growing 
more wrong until there is no bearing it 
anymore and that right, however op-
posed, comes right at last. 
Comes right at last. Think about 
that. This is America, home of the 
brave, land of the free—the America of 
Ben Franklin, who said: 
If you make yourself a sheep, the wolves 
will eat you. 
Don’t make yourself a sheep. The 
wolves will eat you. 
The America of Thomas Jefferson, 
who said at another difficult moment: 
A little patience, and we shall see the reign 
of witches pass over, their spirits dissolve, 
and the people, recovering their true sight, 
restore their government to its true prin-
ciples. 
The America of Tom Paine, who said: 
The mind once enlightened cannot again 
become dark. 
Now, we showed you hour after hour 
of realtime evidence demonstrating 
every step of Donald Trump’s constitu-
tional crime. We showed you how he in-
doctrinated the mob with his Orwellian 
propaganda about how the election he 
lost by more than 7 million votes and 
306 to 232 in the electoral college— 
which he had described as a landslide 
when he won by the exact same margin 
in 2016—was actually a landslide vic-
tory for him being stolen away by a bi-
partisan conspiracy and fraud and cor-
ruption. 
We showed you how 61 courts and 88 
judges—Federal, State, local, trial, ap-
pellate—from the lowest courts in the 
land to the United States Supreme 
Court across the street and 8 Federal 
judges he himself named to the bench, 
all found no basis in fact or law for his 
outlandish and deranged inventions 
and concoctions about the election. 
In the meantime, President Trump 
tried to bully State-level officials to 
commit a fraud on the public by lit-
erally ‘‘finding’’ votes. We examined 
the case study of Georgia, where he 
called to threaten Republican Brad 
Raffensperger to find him 11,780 votes. 
That is all he wanted, he said, 11,780 
votes—don’t we all—11,780 votes, that 
is all he wanted to nullify Biden’s vic-
tory and to win the election. 
Raffensperger ended up with savage 
death threats against him and his fam-
ily, telling him he deserved a firing 
squad. Another election official urged 
Trump to cut it out or people would 
get hurt and killed, a prescient warn-
ing indeed. Raffensperger ended up say-
ing that he and his family supported 
Donald Trump, gave him money, and 
now Trump ‘‘threw us under the bus.’’ 
We saw what happened in Lansing, 
MI, with the extremist mob he cul-
tivated, which led to two shocking Cap-
itol sieges and a criminal conspiracy 
by extremists to kidnap and likely as-
sassinate Governor Whitmer. 
We saw him trying to get State legis-
latures to disavow and overthrow their 
popular election results and replace 
them with Trump electors. We showed 
you the process of summoning the mob, 
reaching out, urging people to come to 
Washington for a ‘‘wild’’ time. 
As we celebrate Presidents Day on 
Monday, think, imagine: Is there an-
other President in our history who 
would urge supporters to come to 
Washington for a ‘‘wild’’ time? 
You saw how he embraced the violent 
extremist elements like the Proud 
Boys, who were told in a nationally 
televised Presidential candidate debate 
to ‘‘stand back and stand by,’’ which 
became their official slogan as they 
converged on Washington with other 
extremist and seditious groups and 
competed to be the lead storm troopers 
of the attack on this building. 
You saw the assembly of the mob on 
January 6. And how beautiful that 
angry mob must have looked to Donald 
Trump as he peered down from the lec-
tern with the seal of the President of 
the United States of America embla-
zoned on it. 
That crowd was filled with extrem-
ists in tactical gear, armed to the teeth 
and ready to fight, and other brawling 
MAGA supporters, all of them saying: 
Stop the steal right now. And he said 
he was going to march with them to 
the Capitol, even though the permit for 
the rally specifically forbade a march. 
But he said he would march with them, 
giving them more comfort that what 
they were doing was legitimate, it was 
OK. 
But, of course, he stayed back, as he 
presumably didn’t want to be too close 
to the action at the Capitol, as the law-
yers called it—not an insurrection, 
they urged us yesterday; it is an ac-
tion. He didn’t want to be too close to 
the action when all hell was about to 
break loose. 
Now, incitement, as we have dis-
cussed, requires an inherently fact- 
based evidentiary inquiry, and this is 
what we did. We gave you many hours 
of specific, factual details about, to use 
Congresswoman CHENEY’s words, how 
the President summoned the mob, as-
sembled the mob, incited it, lit the 
match, sending them off to the Capitol 
where they thought, as they yelled out, 
that they had been invited by the 
President of the United States. 
And then, of course, they unleashed 
unparalleled violence against our over-
whelmed and besieged but heroic police 
officers, who you thoughtfully honored 
yesterday, when the officers got in 
their way as they entered the Capitol 
at the behest of the President of the 
United States to stop the steal. 
Now, I am convinced most Senators 
must 
be 
convinced 
by 
this 
over-
whelming and specific detail, because 
most Americans are. But say you still 
have your doubts; you think the Presi-
dent really thought that he was send-
ing his followers to participate in a 
peaceful, nonviolent rally, the kind 
that might have been organized by Ju-
lian Bond, who my distinguished oppos-
ing counsel brought up; Ella Baker; 
Bob Moses; our late, beloved colleague 
John Lewis, for the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee. 
Maybe the President really thought 
this was going to be like the March on 
Washington 
organized 
by 
Bayard 
Rustin and Dr. Martin Luther King, 
who said: 
Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial 
moral and political questions of our time. 
So let’s say you are still flirting with 
the idea that Donald Trump’s conduct 
was totally appropriate, as he pro-
claimed right off the bat, and he is the 
innocent victim of a mass accident or 
catastrophe, like a fire or a flood—as 
we were invited to frame it on our 
opening day by distinguished cocounsel 
or opposing counsel—and you think 
maybe we are just looking for some-
body to blame for this nightmare and 
catastrophe that has befallen the Re-
public. We are just looking for someone 
to blame. 
Well, here is the key question, then, 
in resolving your doubts if you are in 
that category: How did Donald Trump 
react when he learned of the violent 
storming of the Capitol and the threats 
to Senators, Members of the House, 
and his own Vice President, as well as 
the images he saw on TV of the pum-
meling and beating and harassment of 
our police officers? 
Did he spring into action to stop the 
violence and save us? Did he even won-
der about his own security since an 
out-of-control, anti-government mob 
could come after him too? Did he 
quickly try to get in touch with or de-
nounce the Proud Boys, the Oath Keep-
ers, the rally organizers, the Save 
America rally organizers, and everyone 
on the extreme right to tell them that 
this was not what he had in mind, it 
was a big mistake, call it off, call it 
off, call it off—as Representative GAL-
LAGHER begged him to do on national 
television? 
No. He delighted in it. He reveled in 
it. He exalted in it. He could not under-
stand why the people around him did 
not share his delight. 
And then a long period of silence en-
sued while the mob beat the daylights

S722 
February 13, 2021 
out of police officers and invaded this 
building, as you saw on security foot-
age, and proceeded to hunt down Vice 
President Mike Pence as a traitor and 
denounced and cursed Speaker PELOSI, 
both of whom you heard mob members 
say that they wanted to kill. They 
were both in real danger, and our gov-
ernment could have been thrown into 
absolute turmoil without the heroism 
of our officers and the bravery and 
courage of a lot of people in this room. 
Here is what Republican Representa-
tive ANTHONY GONZALEZ of Ohio said. 
He is a former pro football player: 
We are imploring the president to help, to 
stand up, to help defend the U.S. Capitol and 
the United States Congress, which was under 
attack. We are begging, essentially, and he 
was nowhere to be found. 
‘‘Nowhere to be found.’’ And as I have 
emphasized this morning, that derelic-
tion of duty, that desertion of duty was 
central to his incitement of insurrec-
tion and inextricable from it—inex-
tricable, bound together. It reveals his 
state of mind that day, what he was 
thinking as he provoked the mob to vi-
olence and further violence. It shows 
how he perpetuated his continuing of-
fense on January 6, his course of con-
duct charged in the Article of Impeach-
ment as he further incited the mob 
during the attack, aiming it at Vice 
President Mike Pence himself, while 
failing to quell it in either of his roles 
as Commander in Chief or his real role 
that day: ‘‘inciter in chief.’’ 
And it powerfully demonstrates that 
the ex-President knew, of course, that 
violence was foreseeable, that it was 
predictable and predicted that day 
since he was not surprised and not hor-
rified. No. He was delighted. And 
through his acts of omission and com-
mission that day, he abused his office 
by siding with the insurrectionists at 
almost every point, rather than with 
the Congress of the United States, 
rather than with the Constitution. 
In just a moment, my colleague Mr. 
CICILLINE
will 
address 
President 
Trump’s conduct, his actions and inac-
tions, his culpable state of mind during 
the attack, as he will establish yester-
day’s 
explosive 
revelations 
about 
House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY’s desperate call to Trump—and 
Trump’s truly astounding reaction— 
confirming that Trump was doing 
nothing to help the people in this room 
or this building. 
It is now clear beyond a doubt that 
Trump supported the actions of the 
mob, and so he must be convicted. It is 
that simple. 
When he took the stage on January 6, 
he knew exactly how combustible the 
situation was. He knew there were 
many people in the crowd who were 
ready to jump into action, to engage in 
violence at any signal that he needed 
them to fight like hell to stop the 
steal. And that is exactly what he told 
them to do. 
Then he aimed them straight here, 
right down Pennsylvania, at the Cap-
itol, where he told them the steal was 
occurring; that is, the counting of the 
electoral college votes. And we all 
know what happened next. They at-
tacked this building. They disrupted 
the peaceful transfer of power. They in-
jured and killed people, convinced that 
they were acting on his instructions 
and with his approval and protection. 
And while that happened, he further 
incited them while failing to defend us. 
If that is not ground for conviction, if 
that is not a high crime and mis-
demeanor against the Republic and the 
United States of America, then nothing 
is. 
President Trump must be convicted 
for the safety and security of our de-
mocracy and our people. 
Mr. CICILLINE. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, as we 
have 
demonstrated, 
there 
is 
over-
whelming 
evidence 
that 
President 
Trump incited the violence and knew 
violence was foreseeable on January 6. 
He knew that many in the crowd were 
posed for violence at his urging and, in 
fact, many in the sea of thousands in 
the crowd were wearing body armor 
and helmets and holding sticks and 
flagpoles. And then he not only pro-
voked that very same crowd but aimed 
them at the Capitol. He literally point-
ed at this building, at us, during his 
speech. He pointed to the building 
where Congress was going to certify 
the election results and where he knew 
the Vice President himself was pre-
siding over the process. 
No one is suggesting that President 
Trump intended every detail of what 
happened on January 6, but when he di-
rected the sea of thousands before 
him—who, reportedly, were ready to 
engage in real violence—when he told 
that crowd to fight like hell, he incited 
violence targeted at the Capitol, and he 
most certainly foresaw it. My col-
league, Manager DEAN, will stand up 
after and walk you through the over-
whelming evidence that supports those 
claims. 
I want to start, though, by talking 
about what happened after that. There 
was a lot of discussion yesterday about 
what the President knew and when he 
knew it. There are certain things that 
we do not know about what the Presi-
dent did that day, because the Presi-
dent—that 
is, 
former 
President 
Trump—has 
remained 
silent 
about 
what he was doing during one of the 
bloodiest attacks on our Capitol since 
1812. 
Despite a full and fair opportunity to 
come forward, he has refused to come 
and tell his story. As Manager RASKIN 
said, we would all do that. In fact, I 
would insist on it. If I were accused of 
a grave and serious crime that I was in-
nocent of, I would demand the right to 
tell my side of the story. President 
Trump declined. 
But there are certain facts that are 
undisputed, that we know to be true 
despite the President’s refusal to tes-
tify; which is, counsel either ignored 
entirely or didn’t and couldn’t dispute. 
Before I go to those facts, let me 
quickly just touch on a few things. 
First, President Trump and his counsel 
have resorted to arguments that the 
evidence presented was somehow man-
ufactured or hidden from them. I want 
to be very clear about this because this 
is important. In terms of the timing of 
when they received the materials here, 
defense counsel had access to all mate-
rials when they were entitled to have 
them under S. Res. 47, and they cannot 
and have not alleged otherwise. 
As to their desperate claim that evi-
dence 
was 
somehow 
manufactured, 
they have not alleged that one tweet 
from their client was actually inac-
curate—nor can they. We got these 
tweets—which are, of course, state-
ments from the former President—from 
a public archive, and they are all cor-
rect. 
We also know the President’s claims 
about evidence being manipulated also 
are untrue because they didn’t even ob-
ject to the introduction of the evidence 
when they had the opportunity to do 
so. So I hope we can now set those 
issues aside and turn to the facts of 
this case and really set the record 
straight about the undisputed facts in 
this case, about what the President 
knew that day and when he knew it. 
At the outset, let me say this. As you 
may recall, in direct response to a 
question yesterday, President Trump’s 
counsel stated, and I quote: 
At no point was the President informed the 
Vice President was in any danger. 
As we walk through these undisputed 
facts, you will see, quite clearly, that 
is simply not true. 
As you can see here, from just after 
12 p.m. to just before 2 p.m., President 
Trump delivered his statements at the 
rally, which incited an initial wave of 
protesters coming down to the Capitol, 
and his speech was still ongoing, and 
you saw the evidence of people broad-
casting that on their phones. 
He finished his speech at 11:11 p.m., 
at which point a much larger wave 
surged toward us here at the Capitol, 
ripping down scaffolding and triggering 
calls for law enforcement assistance. 
Thirty minutes later, at 1:49 p.m., as 
the 
violence 
intensified, 
President 
Trump tweeted a video of his remarks 
at the rally with the caption: 
Our country has had enough, we will not 
take it anymore, and that’s what this is all 
about. 
During the half-hour following that 
tweet, the situation here drastically 
deteriorated. Insurrectionists breached 
the Capitol barriers, then its steps, 
then the complex itself. 
By 2:12, the insurrectionist mob had 
overwhelmed the police and started 
their violent attack on the Capitol. 
And as you all know, this attack oc-
curred and played out on live tele-
vision. Every major network was show-
ing it. We have shown you, during the 
course of this trial, side-by-side ex-
actly what the President would have 
seen on TV or his Twitter account.

S723 
February 13, 2021 
We have also shown you that he 
would have seen around 2:12 p.m. im-
ages of Vice President Pence being 
rushed off the Senate floor. I won’t re-
play all of that for you, but for timing 
purposes, here is the footage reacting 
to Vice President Pence leaving the 
floor. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. No audio. They just 
cut out. It looks—and sometimes the Senate. 
Unidentified Speaker. It seemed like they 
just ushered Mike Pence out really quickly. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes, they did. That 
is exactly what just happened there. 
Unidentified Speaker. They ushered Mike 
Pence out. They moved him fast. There 
was—I saw the motions too. 
Defense counsel seems to suggest 
that somehow the President of the 
United States was not aware of this; 
that the President had no idea that his 
Vice President had been evacuated 
from the Senate floor for his safety be-
cause violent rioters had broken into 
the Capitol with thousands more com-
ing and with the Capitol Police com-
pletely overwhelmed. 
This was on live television. 
So defense counsel is suggesting that 
the President of the United States 
knew less about this than the Amer-
ican people—this is just not possible— 
that the Secret Service failed to men-
tion that his Vice President was being 
rushed from the Senate for his own 
protection, but nobody in the White 
House thought to alert him; that none 
of our law enforcement agencies raised 
a concern to the Commander in Chief 
that the Vice President was being evac-
uated from the Senate floor as a vio-
lent mob assaulted the Capitol. It sim-
ply cannot be. And with each passing 
minute on the timeline of events on 
January 6, it grows more and more in-
conceivable. 
Let’s continue forward in time. 
Between 2:12 to 2:24, the Senate re-
cessed. Speaker NANCY PELOSI was ush-
ered off the floor. The Capitol Police 
announced a breach and a lockdown, 
and the insurrectionist mob began 
chanting: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’ And it 
was unfolding on live TV in front of the 
entire world. 
So, again, let me ask you: Does it 
strike you as credible that nobody, not 
a single person, informed the President 
that his Vice President had been evacu-
ated or that the President didn’t 
glance at the television or his Twitter 
account and learn about the events 
that were happening? 
Remember, this was the day of the 
electoral college. Remember his obses-
sion with stopping the certification. It 
is just not credible that the President 
at no point knew his Vice President 
was in this building and was in real 
danger. 
Senators, I submit to you these facts, 
this timeline is undisputed. At 2:24 
p.m., after rioters breached the bar-
riers, after calls for assistance, after ri-
oters stormed the building, after Vice 
President Pence was rushed from the 
Senate floor, and just before Vice 
President Pence was further evacuated 
for his safety, President Trump decided 
to attack his own Vice President on 
Twitter. 
The undisputed facts confirmed that 
not only must President Trump have 
been aware of the Vice President’s dan-
ger but he still sent out a tweet at-
tacking him, further inciting the very 
mob that was in just a few feet of him, 
inside of this very building. 
The Vice President was there with 
his family, who was in danger for his 
life. They were chanting, ‘‘Hang Mike 
Pence,’’ and had erected a noose out-
side. 
And as we have shown, the mob re-
sponded to President Trump’s attack 
instantly. The tweet was read allowed 
on a bullhorn, if you remember that 
video. Insurrectionists began chanting 
again about Mike Pence. 
And in those critical moments, we 
see President Trump engaging in a 
dereliction of his duty by further incit-
ing the mob, in real-time, to target the 
Vice President, with knowledge that 
the insurrection was ongoing. And that 
is, of course, included in the conduct 
charged in this Article of Impeach-
ment. 
The former President’s counsel’s sug-
gestion otherwise is completely wrong. 
His further incitement is impeachable 
conduct that continued during the 
course of this assault itself, and it is 
part of a constitutional crime and was 
entirely and completely a part of his 
indefensible failure to attack the Con-
gress. 
There has been some confusion as to 
the phone call I referenced with Sen-
ator LEE. So I want to be clear about 
certain facts that are not in dispute. 
First, Senator LEE has confirmed that 
the call occurred at 2:26 p.m. So I added 
that to the timeline above. 
Remember, by this phone call, the 
Vice President has just been evacuated 
on live television for his own safety. 
And Donald Trump had, after that, 
tweeted an attack on him, which the 
insurgents read on a bullhorn. And a 
few minutes after Donald Trump’s 
tweet, he didn’t reach out to check on 
the Vice President’s safety. (Text de-
leted.) The call was interrupted. Sen-
ator TUBERVILLE has since explained, 
and I quote: 
I looked at the phone and it said the White 
House on it, [and] I said hello, the President 
said a few words. I said ‘‘Mr. President 
they’re taking the Vice President out and 
they want me to get off the phone and I’ve 
got to go.’’ 
That was his second evacuation that 
day. A minute later, live feeds docu-
mented the insurgents chanting: 
Mike Pence is a traitor. 
At this point, even if somehow he had 
missed it earlier, it is inconceivable 
that the President—the former Presi-
dent—was unaware that the Vice Presi-
dent was in danger. And what does the 
President do after hearing that? Does 
he rush to secure the Capitol? Does he 
do anything to quell the mob? Does he 
call his Vice President to check on his 
safety? We all know the answers to 
those questions too. There can be no 
dispute. He took none of those steps, 
not a single one. 
Even after learning that Senators 
were being evacuated and that Vice 
President Pence had also been evacu-
ated, he did nothing to help the Vice 
President. 
And here is some more evidence that 
we have since learned. At some point 
over the following 30 minutes, Presi-
dent Trump spoke to Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY. And as Representa-
tive JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER has re-
vealed—evidence that now has been 
stipulated as part of the evidentiary 
record—in that conversation, KEVIN 
MCCARTHY is pleading with the former 
President to do something. He first 
tries to assign the blame to another 
group, and Leader MCCARTHY says: No, 
these are your supporters, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
What does the President say in re-
sponse? Not ‘‘I’ll send people right 
away; I didn’t realize you were in dan-
ger.’’ He says: 
Well, Kevin— 
And I quote. I quote: 
Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more 
upset about the election than you are. 
I guess these people are more upset about 
the election than you are. 
The President, just as he conveyed in 
that tweet at 6:01, was essentially say-
ing: You got what you deserve. Let me 
say that again. Not only was the Presi-
dent fully aware of the Vice President’s 
situation and the situation that we 
were all in, when he was asked for help, 
when he was asked to defend the Cap-
itol less than 30 minutes after inciting 
this violence against his own Vice 
President, President Trump refused 
that request for assistance, and he told 
us why—his singular focus: stopping 
the certification of the election of his 
opponent. 
He incited the violence to stop the 
certification. He attacked the Vice 
President and further incited the insur-
rection to pressure the Vice President 
to stop the certification of the elec-
tion. He called Senator TUBERVILLE to 
stop the certification, and he refused to 
send help to Congress. This Congress 
and the Vice President of the United 
States were in mortal danger because 
he wanted to stop the certification. He 
did these things—attacking the Vice 
President, calling Senator TUBERVILLE, 
refusing Senator MCCARTHY’s request— 
with full knowledge of the violent at-
tack that was underway at that point. 
He chose retaining his own power over 
the safety of Americans. I can’t imag-
ine more damning evidence of his state 
of mind. 
The call ended with a screaming 
match interrupted by violent rioters 
breaking through the windows of Rep-
resentative MCCARTHY’s office. 
Senators, the President knew this 
was happening. He didn’t do anything 
to help his Vice President or any of 
you or any of the brave officers and 
other employees serving the American 
people that day. His sole focus was 
stealing the election for himself.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S724 
February 13, 2021 
He apparently has still not thought 
of anyone else. (Text deleted.) 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Objec-
tion. This is not in evidence. Objection. 
This is not in evidence. 
If you wanted a stipulation to this— 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
counsel will sit down. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Senators, 
remember— 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Chair has no way of knowing whether 
the evidence is admitted into evidence 
or not. The counsel for the President 
will have the chance to speak, and the 
Chair will consider the issue. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Senators, 
remember, as one of you said, during 
this attack, they could have killed us 
all—our staff, the officers protecting 
all of us, everyone. 
President Trump not only incited it 
but continued inciting it as it occurred 
with attacks on his Vice President and 
then willfully refused to defend us, fur-
thering his provocation and incitement 
by the mob, siding with the mob, siding 
with 
the 
violent 
insurrectionists, 
criminals who killed and injured police 
officers sworn to protect us, because 
they were ‘‘more upset about the elec-
tion’’ than Leader MCCARTHY. 
Those facts are undisputed. President 
Trump has not offered any evidence or 
any argument to disprove them. His 
lawyers almost entirely ignored these 
facts in their short presentation. We 
have only his counsel’s false claim yes-
terday that ‘‘at no point was the Presi-
dent informed that the Vice President 
was in any danger,’’ a claim that is re-
futed not just by common sense but by 
the timeline you have seen and also the 
Vice President’s legal team. 
So there can be no doubt, at the mo-
ment we most needed a President to 
preserve, protect, and defend us, Presi-
dent Trump instead willfully betrayed 
us. He violated his oath. He left all of 
us and officers like Eugene Goodman to 
our own devices against an attack he 
had incited and he alone could stop. 
That is why he must be convicted. 
I would like to conclude by making 
one final point that follows directly 
from what I discussed. Our case and the 
Article of Impeachment before you ab-
solutely includes President Trump’s 
dereliction of duty on January 6, his 
failure as ‘‘inciter in chief’’ to imme-
diately quell or call off the mob, his 
failure as Commander in Chief to im-
mediately do everything in his power 
to secure the Capitol. That is a further 
basis on which to convict, and there 
can be no doubt of that. The ongoing 
constitutional misconduct is like any 
continuing offense, and the proof of 
that is overwhelming. 
Most directly, his dereliction of duty 
offers conclusive, irrefutable evidence 
that he acted willfully, as we charge. 
He wasn’t furious or sad or shocked, 
like virtually everyone else in Amer-
ica. He was reported by those around 
him as ‘‘delighted.’’ Rather than rush 
to our aid or demand his mob retreat, 
he watched the attack on TV and 
praised the mob to Leader MCCARTHY 
as more loyal to him, more upset about 
the 
election. 
That 
was 
all 
that 
mattered. His reaction is also further 
evidence of his intent. He acted exactly 
the way a person would act if they had 
indeed incited the mob to violence to 
stop the steal. 
Moreover, as I have shown, President 
Trump’s dereliction and desertion of 
duty includes his decision to further 
incite the mob even as he failed to pro-
tect us. While the mob hunted Vice 
President Pence in these very halls, he 
attacked Vice President Pence. While 
he tried to stop the steal, he spread the 
big lie. We all saw how his mob re-
sponded in real time. This further in-
citement was part of his dereliction of 
duty. It was also part of his course of 
conduct encouraging and provoking the 
mob to violence. 
President 
Trump’s 
dereliction 
of 
duty also highlights how foreseeable 
the attack was to him. In his tweet 
just after 6 p.m., he said: 
These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. 
This tweet continued his endorse-
ment of the attack, his failure to con-
demn it, his desertion of duty, but it 
also reveals his view this was of course 
what would happen when Congress re-
fused his demand to reject the election 
that he continued to tell his supporters 
was stolen and he had actually won in 
a landslide. Again, he wasn’t surprised. 
He saw this as a predictable result of 
his repeated demands that his followers 
stop the steal by any means possible. 
This was all connected. His derelic-
tion of duty, his desertion of duty was 
part and parcel of the crime charged in 
the impeachment, and it is certainly a 
basis on which to vote for conviction. 
If you believe that he willfully refused 
to defend us and the law enforcement 
officers fighting to save us and that he 
was delighted by the attack and that 
he saw it as a natural result of his call 
to stop the steal and that he continued 
to incite and target violence as the at-
tack unfolded, we respectfully submit 
you must vote to convict and dis-
qualify so that the events on January 6 
can never happen again in this coun-
try. 
Mr. House Manager RASKIN. I would 
like to call up Ms. DEAN. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have a 
point of order. 
Mr. President, moments ago, House 
Manager CICILLINE— 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator will withhold. I am advised by 
the Parliamentarian that debate is not 
in order. 
Mr. LEE. I appeal the ruling of the 
Chair that debate is not in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
Mr. LEE. There is clearly a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A 
quorum has been suggested, and the 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to suspend the quorum 
call. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there objection? Objection is heard. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I withdraw 
my appeal. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
appeal is withdrawn. 
The Chair would advise everybody 
that the evidentiary record is closed. S. 
Res. 47 described the scope of those 
things not admitted into evidence as 
those referenced at trial. New evidence 
is not permitted in closing argument. 
References to such new evidence will 
be stricken. 
Who seeks recognition? 
The House managers have the floor if 
they wish to resume. 
The House managers. 
Ms. Manager DEAN. Mr. President, 
esteemed Senators, good afternoon. 
We are grateful for your kind atten-
tion this week as we engaged in a proc-
ess formulated and put to paper by the 
Founders in my home city of Philadel-
phia, which is getting its fair share of 
attention this week, in 1787—234 years 
ago. 
My colleague Mr. CICILLINE addressed 
the importance of the President’s dere-
liction of duty. I will focus on three 
specific aspects of this case which the 
defense has raised questions about. 
First, the defense suggests that this 
was just one speech and one speech 
cannot incite insurrection, and the de-
fense suggested, because the attack 
was preplanned by some insurrection-
ists, Donald Trump is somehow not 
culpable. Both of these things are, 
mainly, not true nor are they what we 
allege. 
So let’s be clear. We are not sug-
gesting that Donald Trump’s January 6 
speech by itself incited the attack. We 
have shown that his course of conduct 
leading up to and including that speech 
incited the attack. The defense is cor-
rect 
that 
the 
insurrection 
was 
preplanned. That supports our point. 
We argue and the evidence overwhelm-
ingly confirms that Donald Trump’s 
conduct over many months incited his 
supporters to believe, one, his big lie, 
that the only way he could lose was if 
the election were rigged; two, that, to 
ensure the election would not be stolen 
to prevent the fraud, they had to stop 
the steal; and, three, they had to fight 
to stop the steal or they would not 
have a country anymore. 
This conduct took time, and it cul-
minated in Donald Trump’s sending a 
‘‘save the date’’ on December 19, 18 
days before the attack, telling his base 
exactly when, where, and who to fight. 
While he was doing this, he spent $50 
million from his legal defense fund to

simultaneously broadcast his message 
to ‘‘stop the steal’’ over all major net-
works. Donald Trump invited them; he 
incited them; then he directed them. 
Here are a few clips that will help 
bring that story to light. 
(Video presentation of 7–19–2020.) 
The big lie. 
(Text of video presentation of 7–19– 
2020.) 
Mr. Wallace. Can you give a direct answer 
you will accept the election? 
President TRUMP. I have to see. Look, I 
have to see. No, I’m not going to just say 
yes. 
(Text of video presentation of 7–30– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This election will be 
the most rigged election in history. 
(Text of video presentation of 7–31– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This is going to be the 
greatest election disaster in history. 
(Text of video presentation of 8–24– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. The only way they can 
take this election away from us is if this is 
a rigged election. We’re going to win this 
election. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–12– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. It’s a rigged election. 
That’s the only way we are going to lose. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–23– 
2020.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Do you commit to 
making sure that there’s a peaceful transfer 
of power? 
President TRUMP. Get rid of the ballots, 
and you’ll have a very trans-—you’ll have a 
very peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, 
frankly. There’ll be a continuation. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–25– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. That’s the only way 
we’re going—that’s the only way we’re going 
to lose is if there’s mischief, mischief, and 
it’ll have to be on a big scale, so be careful. 
(Text of video presentation of 10–8- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. But this will be one of 
the greatest fraudulent—most fraudulent 
elections ever. 
(Text of video presentation of 10–26– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. I’m not going to let 
this election be taken away from us. That’s 
the only way they’re going to win it. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–4- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the 
American public. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
This is an embarrassment to our country. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
We were getting ready to win this election. 
Frankly, we did win this election. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
(Text of video presentation of 11–5- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. We were winning in all 
the key locations by a lot, actually, and then 
our numbers started miraculously getting 
whittled away in secret, and this is a case 
where they’re trying to steal an election. 
They’re trying to rig an election, and we 
can’t let that happen. 
(Text of video presentations of 12–2- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. You can’t let another 
person steal that election from you. All over 
the country, people are together in holding 
up signs: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’ 
President TRUMP. If we don’t root out the 
fraud—the tremendous and horrible fraud— 
that has taken place in our 2020 election, we 
don’t have a country anymore. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–22– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. We cannot allow a com-
pletely fraudulent election to stand. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–4- 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. We’re going to fight 
like hell, I’ll tell you right now. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
President TRUMP. If you don’t fight to 
save your country with everything you have, 
you’re not going to have a country left. 
President TRUMP. We will not bend. We 
will not break. We will not yield. We will 
never give in. We will never give up. We will 
never back down. We will never ever sur-
render. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–6- 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. All of us here today do 
not want to see our election victory stolen. 
We will never give up. We will never concede. 
It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when 
there’s theft involved. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
President TRUMP. And to use a favorite 
term that all of you people really came up 
with: We will stop the steal. 
President TRUMP. Because you’ll never 
take back our country with weakness. You 
have to show strength, and you have to be 
strong. 
President TRUMP. Make no mistake, this 
election was stolen from you, from me, from 
the country. 
And we fight. We fight like hell, and if you 
don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore. 
Our point is this: This was not one 
speech. This was a deliberate, purpose-
ful effort by Donald Trump, over many 
months, that resulted in the well-orga-
nized mob attack on January 6. 
That brings me to my second point, 
the violence. 
Defense counsel argues that there is 
no way that Donald Trump could have 
known what would happen. Yet we are 
not suggesting nor is it necessary for 
us to prove that Donald Trump knew 
every detail of what would unfold on 
January 6 or even how horrible and 
deadly the attack would become, but 
he did know, as he looked out on that 
sea of thousands in front of him—some 
wearing body armor and helmets, oth-
ers carrying weapons—that the result 
would be violence. The evidence over-
whelmingly demonstrates this. 
A few points on this. 
Donald Trump knew the people he 
was inciting leading up to January 6. 
He saw the violence they were capable 
of. He had a pattern and practice of 
praising and encouraging supporters of 
violence, never condemning it. 
It is not a coincidence that those 
same people—the Proud Boys, the orga-
nizer of the Trump caravan, the sup-
porters and speakers at the second Mil-
lion MAGA March—all showed up on 
January 6. 
And Donald Trump’s behavior was 
different. This was not just a comment 
by an official or a politician fighting 
for a cause; this was months of culti-
vating a base of people who were vio-
lent, praising that violence, and then 
leading them—leading that violence, 
that rage straight to a joint session of 
Congress, where he knew his Vice 
President was presiding. 
And Donald Trump had warnings 
about the crowd in front of him on Jan-
uary 6. There were detailed posts on-
line of attack plans. Law enforcement 
warned that these posts were real 
threats and even made arrests in the 
days leading up to the attack. There 
were credible reports that many would 
be armed and ready to attack the Cap-
itol. 
Despite these credible warnings of se-
rious, dangerous threats to our Capitol, 
when the crowd was standing in front 
of the President, ready to take orders 
and attack, he said: 
We’re going to the Capitol. 
And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you 
don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore. 
Here is a short clip. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–29– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. What do you want to 
call them? Give me a name. Give me a name. 
Who would you like me to condemn? Who 
would you like me to condemn? 
Mr. Wallace. White supremacists and— 
President TRUMP. Proud Boys? Stand 
back and stand by. 
(Video presentation of 10–31–2020.) 
(Text of video presentation of 11–1- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. It is something. Do you 
see the way our people, they—you know, 
they were protecting his bus yesterday be-
cause they are nice. So his bus—they had 
hundreds of cars: Trump, Trump. Trump and 
the American flag. That’s what—you see 
Trump and American flag. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–12– 
2020.) 
At the first Million MAGA March we prom-
ised that if the GOP would not do everything 
in their power to keep Trump in office, that 
we would destroy the GOP. And as we gather 
here in Washington, DC, for a second Million 
MAGA March, we are done making promises. 
It has to happen now. We are going to de-
stroy the GOP. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Destroy the GOP.’’) 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6- 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. Because you’ll never 
take back our country with weakness. You 
have to show strength and you have to be 
strong. 
(Video presentation of 1–6-2021.) 
Senators, the violence on January 6 
was demonstrably foreseeable. Trump 
even said so himself at 6:01 p.m. the 
day of the attack. The last thing he 
said before he went to sleep, ‘‘These are 
the things that happen.’’ He foresaw 
this, and he admitted as much. 
That brings me to my final point, the 
insurrectionists. 
Defense counsel has suggested these 
people came here on their own. The de-
fense brief states that the insurrection-
ists ‘‘did so [for] their own accord and 
for their own reasons and are being 
criminally prosecuted.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S726 
February 13, 2021 
It is true that some insurrectionists 
are being prosecuted, but it is not true 
that they did so of their own accord 
and for their own reasons. The evidence 
makes clear the exact opposite—that 
they did this for Donald Trump at his 
invitation, at his direction, at his com-
mand. They said this before the attack, 
during the attack. They said it after 
the attack. 
Leading up to January 6, in post 
after post, the President’s supporters 
confirmed this was for Donald Trump; 
it was at his direction. 
One supporter wrote: 
If Congress illegally [certified] Biden, . . . 
Trump would have absolutely no choice but 
to demand us to storm the Capitol and kill/ 
beat them up for it. 
They even say publicly, openly, and 
proudly that President Trump would 
help them commandeer the National 
Guard so all they have to do is over-
whelm 2,000 Capitol Police officers. 
During his speech on January 6, 
Trump supporters chanted his words 
back to him. They even live-tweeted 
his commands, as Ms. DEGETTE showed 
you. 
During the attack, the insurrection-
ists at the Capitol changed Donald 
Trump’s words from his tweets, rallies, 
and from the speech of the 6th. 
They 
held 
signs 
that 
said—and 
chanted—‘‘Fight for Trump.’’ ‘‘Stop 
the steal.’’ 
They read his tweets over bullhorns, 
amplifying his demands. 
Another rioter, while live-streaming 
the insurrection from the Capitol, said: 
He’ll be happy. We’re fighting for Trump. 
What is more, the insurrectionists 
were not hiding. They believed they 
were following the orders from our 
Commander in Chief. They felt secure 
enough in the legitimacy of their ac-
tions to take selfies, to post photos and 
videos on social media. 
After the attack, rioter after rioter 
confirmed this too. 
Jenna Ryan, who was later accused 
for her role in the insurrection, said: 
I thought I was following my President. I 
thought we were following what we were 
called to do. 
President Trump requested that we be in 
DC on the 6th. 
When it became clear that Donald 
Trump would not protect them, some 
of 
his 
supporters 
said 
they 
felt 
‘‘duped’’; they felt ‘‘tricked.’’ 
Listen to some of this evidence. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6- 
2021.) 
Ms. Pierson. And even if they think for a 
second that they’re going to get away with 
this today, they got another thing coming 
because today is just a day, and today is just 
the beginning. They haven’t seen a resist-
ance until they have seen a patriot fight for 
their country. If you die today—

the statement was in evidence; the 
slide was not, so we will withdraw the 
slide, but the statement was in evi-
dence. 
They told you themselves they were 
following the President’s orders, and 
you will see something clearly—Donald 
Trump knew who these people were. 
As the slide shows, the people he cul-
tivated, whose violence he praised, 
were all there on January 6—the Proud 
Boys, who Donald Trump told to 
‘‘stand back and stand by’’ in Sep-
tember of 2020; Keith Lee, organizer of 
the Trump caravan that tried to drive 
the Biden campaign bus off the road; 
Katrina Pierson, the speaker at the 
second Million MAGA March—they 
were all there. 
The video you are about to see is in 
the RECORD. 
Oh, correction. The RECORD did in-
clude, appropriately, the last video, so 
we will keep that in the RECORD, and I 
will keep it in my closing remarks. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ators will take their seats. The Senate 
will be in order. 
The Representative may continue. 
Ms. Manager DEAN. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
I have to say, that of all the trials I 
have ever been a part of, this is cer-
tainly one of them. 
As the slides show, the people he cul-
tivated, whose violence he praised, 
were all there on January 6—the Proud 
Boys, who Donald Trump told to 
‘‘stand back and stand by’’ in Sep-
tember of 2020; Keith Lee, the organizer 
of the Trump caravan that tried to 
drive the Biden campaign bus off the 
road; Katrina Pierson, the speaker at 
the second Million MAGA March—they 
were all there. 
Here is one final clip, also submitted 
in the RECORD. 
(Video presentation of 1–6-2021.) 
Senators, some of the insurrection-
ists are facing criminal charges. Don-
ald Trump was acting as our Com-
mander in Chief; he was our President. 
He used his office and the authority it 
commands to incite an attack, and 
when Congress and the Constitution 
were under attack, he abandoned his 
duties, violated his oath, failing to pre-
serve, protect, and defend. 
That is why we are here—because the 
President of the United States, Donald 
J. Trump, incited and directed thou-
sands of people to attack the legisla-
tive branch. He knew what his sup-
porters were capable of. He inflamed 
them, sent them down Pennsylvania 
Avenue, not on any old day but on the 
day we were certifying the election re-
sults. As they were banging on our 
doors, he failed to defend us because 
this is what he wanted. He wanted to 
remain in power. For that crime 
against the Republic, he must be held 
accountable. 
Senators, the insurrectionists are 
still listening. 
Before I end, I must admit, until we 
were preparing for this trial, I didn’t 
know the extent of many of these facts. 
I witnessed the horror, but I didn’t 
know. I didn’t know how deliberate the 
President’s planning was, how he had 
invested in it, how many times he in-
cited his supporters with these lies, 
how carefully and consistently he in-
cited them to violence on January 6. 
While many of us may have tuned 
out his rallies, I also did not know the 
extent that his followers were listen-
ing, were hanging on his every word, 
and honestly, I did not know how close 
the mob actually came to their violent 
end, that they were just steps away 
from all of us, that the death toll could 
have been much higher but for the 
bravery of men and women who protect 
us. 
But now we know. We know the brav-
ery of people like Officer Goodman and 
all the men and women of the Capitol 
Police, of the custodians who with 
pride and a sense of duty in their work 
cleaned up shattered glass, splintered 
wood, and blood-stained floors. We 
know the sacrifice of life and limb. 
We know what Donald Trump did. We 
know what he failed to do. Though it is 
difficult to bear witness and face the 
reality of what happened in these halls, 
what happens if we don’t confront 
these facts? What happens if there is no 
accountability? 
For those who say we need to get 
past this, we need to come together, we 
need to unify, if we don’t set this right 
and call it what it was—the highest 
constitutional crime by the President 
of the United States—the past will not 
be past. The past will become our fu-
ture for my grandchildren and for their 
children. 
Senators, we are in a dialogue with 
history, a conversation with our past 
with a hope for our future. Two hun-
dred and thirty-four years from now, it 
may be that no one person here among 
us is remembered. Yet, what we do 
here, what is being asked of each of us 
here in this moment, will be remem-
bered. History has found us. I ask that 
you not look the other way. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. I would now 
like to bring up Mr. NEGUSE. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, there is 
an old quote from Henry Clay, a son of 
Kentucky, that ‘‘courtesies of a small 
and trivial character are the ones 
[that] strike deepest in the grateful 
and appreciating heart.’’ 
I want to say on behalf of all the 
House managers that we are very 
grateful for the courtesies that you 
have extended to us and the President’s 
counsel during the course of this trial. 
You have heard my colleague Man-
ager 
DEAN
go 
through 
the 
over-
whelming evidence that makes clear 
that President Trump must be con-
victed and disqualified for his high 
crime. I am not going to repeat that 
evidence; it speaks for itself.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S727 
February 13, 2021 
Earlier in this trial, you might recall 
a few days ago that I mentioned my ex-
pectation that President Trump’s law-
yers might do everything they could to 
avoid discussing the facts of this case, 
and I can understand why. I mean, the 
evidence that all of us presented, that 
Manager DEAN has summarized, is pret-
ty devastating. So rather than address 
it, the President has offered up distrac-
tions, excuses, anything but actually 
trying to defend against the facts. 
They 
said 
things 
like 
President 
Trump is now a private citizen, so the 
criminal justice system can deal with 
it, or that we haven’t set a clear stand-
ard for incitement—we talked a lot 
about due process—and that all politi-
cians say words like ‘‘fight.’’ 
I would like to take a minute to ex-
plain why each of those distractions 
are precisely that—distractions—and 
why they do not prevent in any way 
this Senate from convicting President 
Trump. 
No. 1, every President is one day a 
private citizen, so the argument that 
because President Trump has left of-
fice, he shouldn’t be impeached for con-
duct committed while he was in office 
doesn’t make sense. I mean, why would 
the Constitution include the impeach-
ment power at all if the criminal jus-
tice system serves as a suitable alter-
native once a President leaves office? 
It wouldn’t. 
Impeachment is a remedy separate 
and apart from the criminal justice 
system, and for good reason. The Presi-
dency comes with special powers, ex-
traordinary powers not bestowed on or-
dinary citizens, and if those powers are 
abused, they can cause great damage to 
our country, and they have to be dealt 
with in a separate forum, this forum. 
It would be unwise to suggest that, 
going forward, the only appropriate re-
sponse to constitutional offenses com-
mitted by a President are criminal 
charges when the President returns to 
private life. That is not the kind of po-
litical system any of us want, and it is 
not the kind of constitutional system 
the Framers intended. 
Second, it is true we have not cited 
criminal 
statutes 
establishing 
ele-
ments of incitement because, again, 
this isn’t a criminal trial. It is not a 
criminal case. President Trump is 
charged with a constitutional offense, 
and you are tasked with determining 
whether or not he committed that high 
crime as understood by our Framers. 
So 
the 
relevant question, which 
President Trump’s lawyers would have 
you ignore, is, Would our Framers have 
considered a President inciting a vio-
lent mob to attack our government 
while seeking to stop the certification 
of our elections—would they have con-
sidered that an impeachable offense? 
Who among us, who among us really 
thinks the answer to that question is 
no? 
Third, due process. So just to be ab-
solutely clear, the House, with the sole 
power 
of 
impeachment, 
determines 
what the process looks like in the 
House, and the Senate does the same 
for the trial. 
During this trial, the President has 
counsel. They have argued very vigor-
ously on his behalf. We had a full pres-
entation of evidence, adversarial pres-
entations, motions. The President was 
invited to testify. He declined. The 
President was invited to provide excul-
patory evidence. He declined. You can’t 
claim there is no due process when you 
won’t participate in the process. 
And we know this case isn’t one that 
requires a complicated legal analysis. 
You all—you lived it. The managers 
and I, we lived it. Our country lived it. 
The President, in public view, right out 
in the open, incited a violent mob, a 
mob that temporarily, at least, stopped 
us from certifying an election. If there 
were ever an exigent circumstance, 
this is it. 
No. 4, we all know that President 
Trump’s defense, as we predicted, spent 
a lot of time—all the time comparing 
his conduct to other politicians using 
words like ‘‘fight.’’ Of course, you saw 
the hours of video. As I said on Thurs-
day, we trust you to know the dif-
ference because what you will not find 
in those video montages that they 
showed you is any of those speeches, 
those remarks culminating in a violent 
insurrection on our Nation’s Capitol. 
That is the difference. 
The President spent months inflam-
ing his supporters to believe that the 
election had been stolen from him, 
from them, which was not true. He 
summoned the mob, assembled the 
mob, and when the violence erupted, he 
did nothing to stop it; instead, inciting 
it further. 
Senators, all of these arguments of-
fered by the President have one funda-
mental thing in common—one. They 
have nothing to do with whether or 
not—factually, whether or not the 
President incited this attack. They 
have given you a lot of distractions so 
they don’t have to defend what hap-
pened here on that terrible day, and 
they do that because they believe those 
distractions are going to work, that 
you will ignore the President’s conduct 
instead of confronting it. 
I think they are wrong. Some of you 
know this already. I am the youngest 
member of our manager team by quite 
a few years, so perhaps I am a bit 
naive, but I just don’t believe that. I 
really don’t. I don’t believe their effort 
is going to work, and here is why: be-
cause I know what this body is capable 
of. 
I may not have witnessed it, but I 
have read about it in the history 
books. I have seen the C–SPAN footage, 
archives, 
sometimes 
have 
watched 
them for hours—yes, I have actually 
done that—and the history of our coun-
try in those books and in those tapes, 
the history of this country has been de-
fined right here on this floor. 
The 13th Amendment, the amend-
ment abolishing slavery, was passed in 
this very room. In this room—not figu-
ratively, literally where you all sit and 
where I stand. In 1964, this body, with 
the help of Senators like John Sher-
man Cooper and so many others, this 
body secured passage of the Civil 
Rights Act. We made the decision to 
enter World War II from this Chamber. 
We have certainly had our struggles, 
but we have always risen to the occa-
sion when it mattered the most, not by 
ignoring injustice or cowering to bul-
lies and threats but by doing the right 
thing, by trying to do the right thing, 
and that is why so many nations 
around the world aspire to be like 
America. They stand up to dictators 
and autocrats and tyrants because 
America is a guiding light for them, a 
North Star. They do so, they look to us 
because we have been a guiding light, a 
North Star in these moments because 
the people who sat in your chairs, when 
confronted with choices that define us, 
rose to the occasion. 
I want to offer one more example of 
a decision made in this room by this 
body that resonated with me. The first 
day I stood up in this trial, I men-
tioned that I was the son of immi-
grants, like many of you, and many 
Senators graciously approached me 
after my presentation and asked me 
where my parents were from, and I told 
folks who asked that my folks were 
from East Africa. 
In 1986, this body considered a bill to 
override President Reagan’s veto of 
legislation 
opposing 
sanctions 
on 
South Africa during apartheid. Two 
Senators who are sitting in this room, 
one Democrat and one Republican, 
voted to override that veto. 
That vote was not about gaining po-
litical favor. In fact, it was made de-
spite potentially losing political favor. 
And I have to imagine that that vote 
was cast, like the decisions before it, 
because there are moments that tran-
scend party politics and that require us 
to put country above our party because 
the consequences of not doing so are 
just too great. Senators, this is one of 
those moments. 
Many folks who are watching today’s 
proceedings may not know this, but 
House Members like me, Manager 
RASKIN, and fellow managers, we are 
not allowed on the Senate floor with-
out express permission. No one is. Cer-
tainly, the Senators are aware of that. 
This floor is sacred. It is one of the 
reasons why I, like so many of you, 
were so offended to see it desecrated by 
that mob and to see those insurrection-
ists diminishing it and devaluing it and 
disrespecting these hallowed Halls that 
my whole life I held in such awe. 
Because of those rules that I just 
mentioned, this will be the only time I 
have the privilege to stand before you 
like this. When the trial is over, I will 
go back to being not impeachment 
manager but to being just a House 
Member. The trial will end, and we will 
resume our lives and our work. 
But for some, there will be no end— 
no end to the pain of what happened on 
January 6. The officers who struggled 
to recover from the injuries they sus-
tained to protect us, they struggle to

February 13, 2021 
recover today, and the families who 
continue to mourn those whom they 
lost on that terrible, tragic day. 
I was struck yesterday by defense 
counsel’s continued references to hate. 
One of my favorite quotes of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.—it is one that has 
sustained me during times of adversity, 
and I suspect it has sustained some of 
you: 
I have decided to stick with love. Hate is 
too great a burden to bear. 
This trial is not born from hatred— 
far from it. It is born from a love of 
country—our country—and our desire 
to maintain it and our desire to see 
America at its best. And in those mo-
ments that I spoke of—the Civil Rights 
Act and so much more—we remember 
those moments because they helped de-
fine and enshrine America at its best. 
I firmly believe that our certification 
of the electoral college votes in the 
early hours of January 7, our refusal to 
let our Republic be threatened and 
taken down by a violent mob, will go 
down in history as one of those mo-
ments too. And I believe that this body 
can rise to the occasion once again 
today by convicting President Trump 
and defending our Republic. 
And the stakes—the stakes—could 
not be higher, because the cold, hard 
truth is that what happened on Janu-
ary 6 can happen again. I fear, like 
many of you do, that the violence we 
saw on that terrible day may be just 
the beginning. We have shown you the 
ongoing risks and the extremist groups 
that grow more emboldened every day. 
Senators, this cannot be the begin-
ning. It can’t be the new normal. It has 
to be the end. That decision is in your 
hands. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, my daughter Hannah said 
something to me last night that 
stopped me cold and brought me up 
short. The kids have been very moved 
by all the victims of the violence, the 
officers and their families, but Hannah 
told me last night she felt really sorry 
for the kid of the man who said good-
bye to his children before he left home 
to come and join Trump’s actions. 
Their father had told them that their 
dad might not be coming home again, 
and they might never see him again. In 
other words, he was expecting violence 
and he might die, as insurrectionists 
did. And that shook me. 
Hannah said: How can the President 
put children and people’s families in 
that situation and then just run away 
from the whole thing? 
That shook me, and I was filled with 
self-reproach because, when I first saw 
the line about ‘‘your father going to 
Washington and you might not see him 
again,’’ I just thought about it, well, 
like a prosecutor, like a manager. I 
thought: What damning evidence that 
people were expecting lethal violence 
at a protest called by the President of 
the United States in saying their final 
goodbyes to their kids. But Hannah— 
my dear Hannah—thought of it like a 
human being. She thought of it—if you 
will forgive me—like a patriot, some-
one who just lost her brother and 
doesn’t want to see any other kids in 
America go through that kind of agony 
and grief. 
Senators, when I say all three of my 
kids are better than me, you know that 
I am not engaged in idle flattering. 
Maybe some of you feel the same way 
about your kids. They are literally bet-
ter people. They have got a lot of their 
mom inside of them. They are better 
than me. And Hannah saw through the 
legality of the situation. She saw 
through the politics of the situation, 
all the way to the humanity of the sit-
uation and the morality of the situa-
tion. That was one of the most patri-
otic things I ever heard anybody say. 
The children of the insurrectionists, 
even the violent and dangerous ones— 
they are our children too. They are 
Americans, and we must take care of 
them and their future. We must recog-
nize and exorcise these crimes against 
our Nation, and then we must take 
care of our people and our children— 
their hearts and their minds. As 
Tommy Raskin used to say: It’s hard to 
be human. 
Many of the Capitol and Metropoli-
tan police officers and Guards men and 
women who were beaten up by the mob 
also have kids. You remember Officer 
Fanone, who had a heart attack after 
being tased and roughed up for hours 
by the mob, and then begging for his 
life telling the insurrectionists that he 
had four daughters, and that just about 
broke my heart all over again. We 
talked about this for a long time last 
night. My kids felt terrible that other 
kids’ fathers and mothers were pulled 
into this nightmare by a President of 
the United States. 
Senators, we proved to you he be-
trayed his country. We proved he be-
trayed his Constitution. We proved he 
betrayed his oath of office. The star-
tling thing to recognize now is that he 
is even betraying the mob. He told 
them he would march with them, and 
he didn’t. They believed the President 
was right there with them, somewhere 
in the crowd, fighting the fantasy con-
spiracy—steal the election and steal 
their country away from them. They 
thought they were one big team work-
ing together. He told them their great 
journey together was just beginning, 
and now there are hundreds of criminal 
prosecutors getting going all over the 
country and people getting set to say 
goodbye to members of their family. 
And the President who contacted 
them, solicited them, lured him, in-
vited them, and incited them, that 
President has suddenly gone quiet and 
dark, nowhere to be found. He cannot 
be troubled to come here to tell us 
what happened and tell us why this was 
the patriotic and the constitutional 
thing to do. 
Senators, this trial, in the final anal-
ysis, is not about Donald Trump. The 
country and the world know who Don-
ald Trump is. This trial is about who 
we are—who we are. My friend, Dar 
Williams, said that sometimes the 
truth is like a second chance. We have 
got a chance here with the truth. 
We still believe in the separation of 
powers. President Trump tried to side-
line or run over every other branch of 
government, thwart the will of the peo-
ple at the State level, and usurp the 
people’s choice for President. 
This case is about whether our coun-
try demands a peaceful, nonviolent 
transfer of power to guarantee the sov-
ereignty of the people. Are we going to 
defend the people who defend us, not 
just honor them with medals, as you 
rightfully did yesterday, but actually 
back them up against savage, barbaric 
insurrectionary violence? Will we re-
store the honor of our Capitol and the 
people who work here? Will we be a 
democratic nation that the world looks 
to for understanding democratic values 
and practices and constitutional gov-
ernment and the rights of women and 
men? Will the Senate condone the 
President of the United States inciting 
a violent attack on our Chambers, our 
offices, our staff, and the officers who 
protect us? 
When you see the footage of Officer 
Hodges stuck in the doorway, literally 
being tortured by the mob—if the gov-
ernment did that to you, that would be 
torture. And when you see that foot-
age, and he is shouting in agony for his 
dear life, it is almost unwatchable. 
When the Vice President of the United 
States escapes a violent mob that has 
entered this Capitol Building seeking 
to hang him and calling out ‘‘traitor, 
traitor, traitor,’’ and when they shut 
down the counting of the electoral col-
lege votes, is this the future you imag-
ined for our kids? Is it totally appro-
priate, as we have been told? Or as Rep-
resentative CHENEY
said, is it the 
greatest betrayal of the Presidential 
oath of office in the history of our 
country? 
And if we can’t handle this together 
as a people—all of us—forgetting the 
lines of party and ideology and geog-
raphy and all of those things, if we 
can’t handle this, how are we ever 
going to conquer the other crises of our 
day? 
Is this America? Is this what we want 
to bequeath to our children and our 
grandchildren? 
I was never a great Sunday school 
student. Actually, I was pretty truant 
most of the time. But one line always 
stuck with me from the Book of Exo-
dus as both beautiful and haunting, 
even as a kid, after I asked what the 
words meant. 
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do 
evil. 
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do 
evil. 
The officer who got called the N-word 
15 times and spent hours with his col-
leagues battling insurrectionists who 
had metal poles and baseball bats and 
hockey sticks, bear spray, and Confed-
erate battle flags posed the right ques-
tion to the Senate and to all of us: 
Is this America?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S729 
February 13, 2021 
Dear Senators, it is going to be up to 
you, and whatever committees and sub-
committees you are on, whatever you 
came to Washington to do to work on— 
from defense to agriculture, to energy, 
to aerospace, to healthcare—this is al-
most certainly how you will be remem-
bered by history. That might not be 
fair. It really might not be fair, but 
none of us can escape the demands of 
history and destiny right now. Our rep-
utations and our legacy will be inex-
tricably intertwined with what we do 
here and with how you exercise your 
oath to do impartial justice—impartial 
justice. 
I know and I trust you will do impar-
tial justice, driven by your meticulous 
attention to the overwhelming facts of 
the case and your love for our Con-
stitution, which I know dwells in your 
hearts. 
‘‘The times have found us,’’ said Tom 
Paine, the namesake of my son. ‘‘The 
times have found us.’’ Is this America? 
What kind of America will we be? It’s 
now literally in your hands. Godspeed 
to the Senate of the United States. 
We reserve any remaining time. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House has reserved 28 minutes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Proceed. 
COUNSELS’ CLOSING ARGUMENTS 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. I will 
promise that I will be the only one 
talking, and it will not be so long. 
Before I start my prepared closing, I 
really want to clean up a few things 
from the mess that was the closing of 
the House managers. I do not want to 
ruin my closing because I think the 
ending is pretty good. 
What they didn’t—they started off by 
misstating the law, and they started 
off by misstating the intent of our stip-
ulation. What we did today was stipu-
late to an article that was published in 
a magazine, apparently, they have had 
for weeks, according to the documents 
they produced today, but for some rea-
son this morning popped up with it. 
The stipulation was that they can 
put that in. We did not stipulate to its 
contents for truthfulness, and they 
tried to portray that in their closing as 
the stipulation. The stipulation was 
read into the RECORD. The proponents 
of that conversation—the real ones— 
have denied its content, its veracity. 
With respect to—and I am not going 
to talk much about the tortured anal-
ysis of our arson wars that started off 
or the truly sideways analogies that 
were used with fires. What I do want to 
talk about, though, is the doctoring of 
evidence. 
First of all, they sent us their evi-
dence on Tuesday the 9th at 2:32 p.m. 
by email. I was in the room trying the 
case already when they sent their evi-
dence—due process. 
They used evidence that was flat 
wrong two or three nights ago with 
Senator LEE and had to withdraw it. 
They tried to use it again today. 
They tried to use evidence that they 
had never presented in the case in their 
closing argument. That is a very des-
perate 
attempt 
by 
a 
prosecuting 
team—nine of them—by a prosecuting 
team that knew that their case has col-
lapsed. 
Their closing did not mention one 
piece of law. They didn’t talk about the 
Constitution once. They didn’t talk 
about the First Amendment and its ap-
plication. They didn’t talk about due 
process and how it applies to this pro-
ceeding for my client. 
The basic rule of any court is that 
when you close a case out, you close on 
the facts that were admitted in the 
trial. It is a basic, fundamental prin-
ciple of due process and fairness. And 
that was violently breached today on 
multiple occasions. And you have to 
ask yourself why? Why did they resort 
to those tactics at this moment in 
time? 
Senators, good afternoon. Mr. Presi-
dent. 
What took place here at the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6 was a grave trag-
edy. Over the course of this trial, you 
have heard no one on either side of this 
debate argue that the infiltration of 
the Capitol was anything less than a 
heinous act on the home of American 
democracy. 
All of us, starting with my client, are 
deeply disturbed by the graphic videos 
of the Capitol attack that have been 
shown in recent days. The entire team 
condemned and have repeatedly con-
demned the violence and law breaking 
that occurred on January 6 in the 
strongest possible terms. We have ad-
vocated that everybody be found and 
punished to the maximum extent of the 
law. Yet the question before us is not 
whether there was a violent insurrec-
tion of the Capitol. On that point, ev-
eryone agrees. 
Based on the explicit text of the 
House Impeachment Article, this trial 
is about whether Mr. Trump willfully 
engaged in an incitement of violence 
and even insurrection against the 
United States, and that question they 
have posed in their Article of Impeach-
ment has to be set up against the law 
of this country. 
No matter how much truly horrifying 
footage we see of the conduct of the ri-
oters and how much emotion has been 
injected into this trial, that does not 
change the fact that Mr. Trump is in-
nocent of the charges against him. 
Despite all of the video played, at no 
point in their presentation did you 
hear the House managers play a single 
example of Mr. Trump urging anyone 
to engage in violence of any kind. At 
no point did you hear anything that 
could ever possibly be construed as Mr. 
Trump encouraging or sanctioning an 
insurrection. 
Senators, you did not hear those 
tapes because they do not exist, be-
cause the act of incitement never hap-
pened. He engaged in no language of in-
citement whatsoever on January 6 or 
any other day following the election. 
No unbiased person honestly review-
ing the transcript of Mr. Trump’s 
speech on the Ellipse could possibly be-
lieve that he was suggesting violence. 
He explicitly told the crowd that he ex-
pected the protest outside the Capitol 
to be peaceful and patriotic. 
They claim that is not enough. 
His entire premise was that the pro-
ceedings of the joint session should 
continue. He spent nearly the entire 
speech talking about how he believes 
the Senators and Members of Congress 
should vote on the matter. 
It is the words. The Supreme Court 
ruled in Brandenburg that there is a 
very clear standard for incitement. In 
short, you have to look at the words 
themselves. The words have to either 
explicitly or implicitly call for—the 
words—call for lawlessness or violence. 
Whether the speech—you have to deter-
mine whether the speech was intended 
to provoke the lawlessness and whether 
the violence was the likely result of 
the word itself. They fail on all three 
prongs. 
The false and defamatory claim that 
Mr. Trump gave a speech encouraging 
his supporters to go attack the Capitol 
has 
been 
repeated 
so 
often, 
uncritically, without any examination 
of the underlying facts, that the Amer-
ican—the 
Americans—listening 
at 
home were probably surprised to learn 
it is not true. 
Furthermore, some of the people in 
this room followed Mr. Trump’s state-
ments and tweets in the weeks leading 
up to January 6 very closely. We know 
that he was not trying to foment an in-
surrection during the time because no 
one—from the Speaker of the House to 
the Mayor of Washington, DC—behaved 
in a fashion consistent with the belief 
that violence was being advocated for. 
Mr. Trump did not spend the weeks 
prior to January 6 inciting violence. He 
spent those weeks pursuing his election 
challenge through the court system 
and other legal procedures, exactly as 
the Constitution and the Congress pre-
scribe. 
To believe based on the evidence you 
have seen that Mr. Trump actually 
wanted and, indeed, willfully incited an 
armed insurrection to overthrow the 
U.S. Government would be absurd. 
The gathering on January 6 was sup-
posed to be an entirely peaceful event. 
Thousands and thousands of people, in-
cluding Mr. Trump, showed up that day 
with that intention. A small percent-
age—a small fraction of those people— 
then engaged in truly horrible behav-
ior. But as we now know, that those ac-
tors were preplanned and premeditated 
and acted even before this speech was 
completed, to which is the basis of the 
Article 
of 
Impeachment. 
It 
was 
preplanned 
and 
premeditated 
by 
fringe—left and right—groups. They hi-
jacked the event for their own pur-
poses. 
The House managers’ false narrative 
is a brazenly dishonest attempt to 
smear, to cancel—constitutional can-
celed culture—their No. 1 political op-
ponent, taking neutral statements, 
commonplace political rhetoric, re-
moving words and facts from context

and ascribing to them the most sinister 
and malevolent intentions possible. 
Their story was based not on evi-
dence but on the shear personal and po-
litical animus. 
The flimsy theory of incitement you 
heard from the House managers could 
be used to impeach, indict, or expel 
countless other political leaders. Many 
leading figures in other parties have 
engaged in far more incendiary and 
dangerous rhetoric, and we played 
some of them. I am not going to replay 
it. I am not going to replay you the 
words. You all saw the evidence. I am 
not going to replay mob scenes. I don’t 
want to give those people another plat-
form, any more view from the Amer-
ican people as to what they did. They 
should be canceled. 
Democrat politicians spent months 
prior to January 6 attacking the very 
legitimacy of our Nation’s most cher-
ished institutions and traditions. They 
didn’t just question the integrity of 
one election; they challenged the in-
tegrity of our entire Nation—every-
thing from our Founding Fathers, our 
Constitution, the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, law enforcement officers, 
and the United States Military. They 
said that our society was rooted in ha-
tred. They even said that America de-
served—and I will quote—‘‘a reck-
oning.’’ 
As you heard yesterday, throughout 
the summer, Democrat leaders, includ-
ing the current President and Vice 
President, repeatedly made comments 
that provided moral comfort to mobs 
attacking police officers. During that 
time, many officers across the country 
were injured. As we all know, two sher-
iff’s deputies in Los Angeles were am-
bushed and shot at point-blank range. 
Members of this very body have been 
in danger. Senators from Maine to Ken-
tucky, and most points in between, 
have been harassed by mobs. 
Last August, a menacing leftwing 
mob swarmed Senator RAND PAUL and 
his wife as they left the White House, 
and they had to be rescued by police. 
For months, our Federal courthouse 
in Portland was placed under siege by 
violent anarchists who attacked law 
enforcement officers daily and repeat-
edly and tried to set fire to the build-
ing. 
Speaker PELOSI did not call the vio-
lent siege of the Federal building an in-
surrection. She called the Federal 
agents 
protecting 
the 
courthouse 
‘‘stormtroopers.’’ 
The White House complex was be-
sieged by mobs that threw bricks, 
rocks, and bottles at Secret Service 
agents, set fire to a historic structure, 
and breached a security fence to infil-
trate the Treasury grounds. 
When 
my 
client’s 
administration 
sent in the National Guard to secure 
the Nation’s Capital City amidst the 
violence, Democrat leaders demanded 
that the forces be withdrawn. 
The Washington, DC, Mayor said the 
presence of the National Guard was an 
affront to the safety of the District. It 
must be fully investigated whether po-
litical leadership here in Washington, 
DC, took an inadequate and irrespon-
sible force posture on January 6 be-
cause of their commitment to the false 
narrative of what happened last June. 
Hopefully we can all now agree that 
the administration acted properly by 
taking action to stop a riotous mob, es-
tablishing an appropriate security pe-
rimeter, and preventing the White 
House from potentially being overrun. 
The House managers argued this 
week that an alleged brief delay in 
issuing a public statement from Mr. 
Trump on January 6 was somehow evi-
dence that he committed incitement or 
supported the violence. Yet for months 
last year Joe Biden and Vice President 
Harris and countless other Democrats 
repeatedly refused to condemn the ex-
tremists as riots were occurring daily, 
as businesses were being ramshackled, 
as neighborhoods were being burned, as 
bombs were exploding. They repeatedly 
refused to tell their violent supporters 
to stand down. 
Some even suggested that the mobs’ 
actions were justified. Vice President 
Harris literally urged her followers to 
donate money to a fund to bail out the 
violent, extreme rioters so that they 
could get out and continue to do it 
over and over again. She later said that 
those folks were not going to let up 
and that they should not. 
All of this was far closer to the ac-
tual definition of ‘‘incitement’’ than 
anything President Trump has ever 
said or done, never mind what he said 
on the 6th. It is a hypocrisy. It is a hy-
pocrisy that the House managers have 
laid at the feet of this Chamber. 
The House managers suggested that 
this recent history is irrelevant to the 
current proceedings, but not only is 
Democrats’ behavior surrounding last 
year’s riots highly relevant as prece-
dent and not only does it reveal the 
dishonesty and insincerity of this en-
tire endeavor, it also provides crucial 
context that should inform our under-
standing of the events that took place 
on January 6. 
Many of the people who infiltrated 
the Capitol took pictures of themselves 
and posted them on social media. To 
some, it seems, they thought that it 
was all a game. They apparently be-
lieved that violent mobs, destruction of 
property, rioting, assaulting police, 
and vandalizing historic treasures was 
somehow now acceptable in the United 
States. Where might they have gotten 
that idea? I would suggest to you that 
it was not from Mr. Trump. It was not 
Mr. Trump. It was not anyone in the 
Republican Party that spent the 6 
months immediately prior to the Cap-
itol assault giving rhetorical aid and 
comfort to mobs, making excuses for 
rioters, celebrating radicalism, and ex-
plaining that angry, frustrated, and 
marginalized people were entitled to 
blow off steam like that. 
Let me be very clear. There can be no 
excuse for the depraved actions of the 
rioters here at the Capitol or anywhere 
else across this country. One hundred 
percent of those guilty of committing 
crimes deserve lengthy prison sen-
tences for their shameful and depraved 
conduct. But this trial has raised the 
question about words, actions, and con-
sequences. 
As a nation, we must ask ourselves, 
how did we arrive at this place where 
rioting and pillaging would become 
commonplace? I submit to you that it 
was month after month of political 
leaders and media personalities, blood-
thirsty for ratings, glorifying civil un-
rest and condemning the reasonable 
law enforcement measures that are re-
quired to quell violent mobs. 
Hopefully we can all leave this Cham-
ber in uniform agreement that all riot-
ing—all rioting—is bad and that law 
enforcement deserves our respect and 
support. That has been Mr. Trump’s po-
sition from the very beginning. 
The real question in this case is, Who 
is ultimately responsible for such acts 
of mayhem and violence when they are 
committed? 
The 
House 
Democrats 
want two different standards—one for 
themselves and one for their political 
opposition. 
They have carried out a grossly un-
constitutional effort to punish Mr. 
Trump for protected First Amendment 
speech. It is an egregious violation of 
his constitutional rights. Since he ut-
tered not a single word encouraging vi-
olence, this action can only be seen as 
an effort to censor disfavored political 
speech and discriminate against a dis-
approved viewpoint. It is an unprece-
dented action with the potential to do 
grave and lasting damage to both the 
Presidency and the separation of pow-
ers and the future of democratic self- 
government. 
Yesterday we played you a video of 
countless Democrat Members of the 
Senate urging their supporters to fight. 
We showed you those videos not be-
cause we think you should be forcibly 
removed from office for saying those 
things but because we know you should 
not be forcibly removed from office for 
saying those things. But recognize the 
hypocrisy. 
Yesterday 
in 
questioning, 
House 
Manager Raskin admitted that the 
House Democrats had invented an en-
tirely new legal standard. In fact, they 
have created a new legal theory: the 
Raskin doctrine. The Raskin doctrine 
is based on nothing more than deter-
mining protected speech based on the 
party label next to your name. Regard-
less of what you have heard or what 
you have seen from the House man-
agers, if you pay close attention, you 
will see that any speech made by Dem-
ocrat elected officials is protected 
speech, while any speech made by Re-
publican elected officials is not pro-
tected. 
The creation of the Raskin doctrine 
actually reveals the weakness of the 
House managers’ case. Elected offi-
cials—and we reviewed this in-depth 
yesterday—under 
Supreme 
Court 
precedent Wood and Bond—by the way,

S731 
February 13, 2021 
Bond didn’t burn his draft card; he ac-
tually still had it. It was part of his de-
fense. But in Bond and in Wood, the 
Court clearly directed all to know that 
elected officials hold the highest pro-
tections of speech, the highest protec-
tions, and I remind you why: because 
you all need to be free to have robust 
political discussion because your dis-
cussion is about how our lives are 
going to go, and that shouldn’t be 
squelched by any political party on ei-
ther side of the aisle, no matter who is 
the majority party at the time. 
Why 
would 
the 
House 
managers 
make up their own legal standard? I 
will tell you why. Because they know 
they cannot satisfy the existing con-
stitutional standard set forth by the 
United States Supreme Court that has 
existed for more than half a century. 
They argue Mr. Trump, as an elected 
official, 
has 
no 
First 
Amendment 
rights. It is the complete opposite of 
the law. We have shown you, without 
contradiction, that is wrong. 
They also know that they cannot sat-
isfy the three-part test of Brandenburg, 
as elucidated in the Bible Believers 
case. 
There was absolutely no evidence 
that Mr. Trump’s words were directed 
to inciting imminent lawless action. 
There was no evidence that Mr. Trump 
intended his words to incite violence. 
And the violence was preplanned and 
premeditated by a group of lawless ac-
tors who must be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law, but it proves 
that his words weren’t what set this 
into motion, what was the incitement. 
With no ability and no evidence to 
satisfy 
the 
existing 
constitutional 
standard, what are the House managers 
to do? They had to make up their own 
law. This is not only intellectually dis-
honest, folks; it is downright scary. 
What type of precedent would be set 
if the Senate did vote to convict? Can 
Congress now ignore Supreme Court 
precedent on the contours of protected 
free speech? Will Congress be permitted 
to continually make up their own legal 
standards and apply those new stand-
ards to elected officials’ speech? This 
would allow Congress to use the awe-
some impeachment power as a weapon 
to impeach their fellow colleagues in 
the opposing party. This is not a prece-
dent that this Senate can set here 
today. 
If the Senate endorses the House 
Democrats’ absurd new theory, you 
will set a precedent that will trouble 
leaders from both parties literally for 
centuries to come, but that will not be 
the only disgraceful precedent to come 
from this case. 
This has been perhaps the most un-
fair and flagrantly unconstitutional 
proceeding in the history of the United 
States Senate. For the first time in 
history, Congress has asserted the 
right to try and punish a former Presi-
dent who is a private citizen. Nowhere 
in the Constitution is the power enu-
merated or implied. Congress has no 
authority, no right, and no business 
holding a trial of Citizen Trump, let 
alone a trial to deprive him of some 
fundamental civil rights. 
There was mention of a January ex-
ception argument. The January excep-
tion argument is a creation of the 
House managers’ own conduct by de-
laying. They sat on the Article. They 
could have tried the President while he 
was still in office if they really be-
lieved he was an imminent threat. 
They didn’t. The January exception is 
a red herring. It is nonsense because 
Federal, State, and local authorities 
can investigate. Their January excep-
tion always expires on January 20. 
House Democrats and this deeply un-
fair trial have shamefully trampled 
every tradition, norm, and standard of 
due process in a way I have never ever 
seen before. Mr. Trump was given no 
right to review the so-called evidence 
against him at trial. He was given no 
opportunity to question its propriety. 
He was given no chance to engage in 
factfinding. 
Much of what was introduced by the 
House was unverified second- or third-
hand reporting cribbed from a biased 
news media, including stories based on 
anonymous sources whose identities 
are not even known to them, never 
mind my client. They manufactured 
and doctored evidence, so much so that 
they had to withdraw it. 
We only had—we had the evidence 
after we started the trial. They went 
on for 2 days, so in the evening, I was 
able to go back and take a really close 
look at the stuff. Myself and Mr. Cas-
tor and Ms. Bateman and Mr. Brennan, 
we all worked hard and looked at the 
evidence, four volumes of books in lit-
tle, tiny print. We started—we literally 
had 12, 14 hours to really look at the 
evidence before we had to go on, and 
just in that short time of looking at 
the evidence, we saw them fabricating 
Twitter accounts. We saw the masked 
man sitting at his desk with the New 
York Times there. 
And when we looked closely, we 
found that the date was wrong; the 
check had been added. They fabricated 
evidence. They made it up. They never 
addressed that in their closing—as 
though it were acceptable, as though it 
were all right, as though that is the 
way it should be done here in the Sen-
ate of the United States of America. 
Fraud—flatout fraud. Where I come 
from, in the courts I practice in, there 
are very harsh repercussions for what 
they pulled in this trial. 
As we have shown, the House man-
agers were caught creating false rep-
resentations of tweets, manipulating 
videos, 
and 
introducing 
into 
the 
RECORD
completely discredited lies, 
such as the ‘‘fine people’’ hoax, as fac-
tual evidence. 
Most of what the House managers 
have said and shown you would be in-
admissible in any respectable court of 
law. They were not trying a case; they 
were telling a political tale—a fable— 
and a patently false one at that. 
House Democrats have denied due 
process and rushed the impeachment 
because they know that a fair trial 
would reveal Mr. Trump’s innocence of 
the charges against him. The more ac-
tual evidence that comes out, the 
clearer it is that this was a preplanned 
and premeditated attack, which his 
language in no way incited. 
Because their case is so weak, the 
House managers have taken a kitchen- 
sink approach to the supposedly single 
Article of Impeachment. They allege 
that Mr. Trump incited the January 6 
violence. They allege that he abused 
power by attempting to pressure Geor-
gia Secretary of State Raffensperger to 
undermine the results of the 2020 elec-
tion, and they allege that he gravely 
endangered the democratic system by 
interfering with the peaceful transition 
of power. There are at least three 
things there. 
Under the Senate rules, each of these 
allegations must have been alleged in a 
separate Article of Impeachment. I 
need not remind this Chamber that 
rule XXIII of the Rules of Procedure 
and Practice in the Senate when Sit-
ting on Impeachment Trials provides, 
in pertinent part, that an Article of 
Impeachment ‘‘shall not be divisible 
. . . thereon.’’ 
Why is that? Because the Article at 
issue here alleges multiple wrongs in 
the single Article, it would be impos-
sible to know if two-thirds of the Mem-
bers agreed on the entire Article or 
just on parts of it as the basis for a 
vote to convict. Based on this alone, 
the Senate must vote to acquit Mr. 
Trump. You have got to at least obey 
your own rules if it is not the Constitu-
tion you are going to obey. 
In short, this impeachment has been 
a complete charade from beginning to 
end. The entire spectacle has been 
nothing but an unhinged pursuit of a 
longstanding political vendetta against 
Mr. Trump by the opposition party. 
As we have shown, Democrats were 
obsessed with impeaching Mr. Trump 
from the very beginning of his term. 
The House Democrats tried to impeach 
him in his first year. They tried to im-
peach him in his second year. They did 
impeach him in his third year. And 
they impeached him again in his fourth 
year. And now they have conducted a 
phony impeachment show trial when 
he is a private citizen out of office. 
This hastily orchestrated and uncon-
stitutional circus is the House Demo-
crats’ final, desperate attempt to ac-
complish their obsessive desire of the 
last 5 years. 
Since the moment he stepped into 
the political arena, my client—since 
my client stepped in, they have been 
possessed by an overwhelming zeal to 
vanquish an independent-minded out-
sider from their midst and to shame, 
demean, silence, and demonize his sup-
porters in the desperate hope that they 
will never, ever pose an electoral chal-
lenge. 
We heard one of the Congressmen on 
the screen: If you don’t impeach him, 
he might be elected again. 
That is the fear. That is what is driv-
ing this impeachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S732 
February 13, 2021 
When you deliberate over your deci-
sion, there are four distinct grounds 
under which you must acquit my cli-
ent. 
First is jurisdiction. There is no ju-
risdiction. And if you believe that, you 
still get to say it. 
Two, rule XXIII—it had to be divis-
ible. Each allegation had to be sin-
gularly set out in front of you so it 
could be voted on and to see if two- 
thirds of you think that they proved 
that case or not. They didn’t do that. 
You have got to ask yourself why. 
They know the Senate rules. They got 
them, and so did I. Why did they do it? 
Because they hadn’t investigated, first 
of all. But, also, what they found out is 
when they were preparing all this, they 
couldn’t do it. So if they threw in as 
much as they could and made as many 
bold, bald allegations as they could, 
then maybe two-thirds of you would 
fall for it. That is why the rules don’t 
allow it to go that way. 
Due process—I have exhausted that 
subject. It is a really good reason for 
all of you—all of you—in this Chamber 
to stop the politics, to read the Con-
stitution and apply it to this pro-
ceeding and acknowledge that the lack 
of due process—way over the top, 
shocking. And you must not stand for 
it. 
And, of course, the First Amend-
ment—the actual facts of this case. 
There were no words of incitement. 
Four grounds. Nobody gets to tell 
you which ground to pick, and nobody 
gets to tell you how many grounds to 
consider. 
Senators, do not let House Demo-
crats take this maniacal crusade any 
further. The Senate does not have to go 
down this dark path of enmity and di-
vision. You do not have to indulge the 
impeachment lust, the dishonesty, and 
the hypocrisy. 
It is time to bring this unconstitu-
tional political theater to an end. It is 
time to allow our Nation to move for-
ward. It is time to address the real 
business pressing this Nation—the pan-
demic, our economy, racial inequality, 
economic and social inequality. These 
are the things that you need to be 
thinking and working on for all of us in 
America—all of us. 
With your vote, you can defend the 
Constitution. You can protect due 
process. And you can allow America’s 
healing to begin. I urge the Senate to 
acquit and vindicate the Constitution 
of this great Republic. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who 
yields time? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, I understand—I am told we 
have around 27 minutes, but I will re-
turn all of that but perhaps 5 back to 
you. There are just a few things I need 
to address. In an extraordinary and 
perhaps unprecedented act of self-re-
straint on my part, I will resist the op-
portunity to rebut every single false 
and illogical thing that you just heard. 
And I am going to be able to return to 
you, you know, perhaps 22, 23 minutes. 
A few points: One, we have definitely 
made some progress in the last few 
days because a few days ago, the Presi-
dent’s team—although I think it was 
perhaps a member who has since left 
the team—lectured us that this was not 
an insurrection and said that impeach-
ment managers were outrageous in 
using the word ‘‘insurrection.’’ Today, 
counsel, in his closing statement, said 
it was a violent insurrection, and he 
denounced it. And I would certainly 
love to see President Trump also call it 
a violent insurrection and denounce it 
too. And I believe—although, I don’t 
have a verbatim text—that counsel 
called for long sentences for the people 
who were involved. Again, I would love 
to hear that come from the President 
as well. 
The distinguished counsel complains 
that there is no precedent with the de-
veloped body of law that the Senate 
has for impeaching and convicting a 
President who incites violent insurrec-
tion against the Congress and the gov-
ernment of the United States. Well, I 
suppose that is true because it never 
occurred to any other President of the 
United 
States—from 
George 
Wash-
ington, to John Adams, to Thomas Jef-
ferson, to James Madison, to James 
Monroe, to Abraham Lincoln, to Ron-
ald Reagan, to George W. Bush, to 
Barack Obama—to incite a violent in-
surrection against the Union. 
You are right. We have got no prece-
dent for that, and so they think that 
that somehow is a mark in their 
favor—that is a score for them—that 
this Senate has to be the first one to 
define incitement of violent insurrec-
tion against the Union. And so the gen-
tleman puts it on me. He says: Inciting 
a President for committing incitement 
to violent insurrection against the 
Union is the new Raskin doctrine. 
We have tried to convince them that 
there are well-known principles and 
elements of incitement, which we have 
talked to you about ad nauseam, and 
that this is an intrinsically, inherently 
fact-based judgment. But if that is the 
Raskin doctrine—that a President of 
the United States cannot incite violent 
insurrection against the Union and the 
Congress—then I embrace it, and I take 
it as an honor. Most law professors 
never even get a doctrine named after 
them, so I will accept that. 
And, finally, the counsel goes back to 
Julian Bond’s case because, I think, in 
the final analysis, their best argu-
ment—as pathetically weak as it is—is 
really about the First Amendment. 
But, remember, they keep talking 
about 
stifling 
President 
Trump’s 
speech. Someone tell me when his 
speech has ever been stifled. He says 
exactly what he wants whenever he 
wants. If and when you convict him for 
incitement of insurrection, he will con-
tinue to say whatever he wants on that 
day. Remember, they referred yester-
day to interference with his liberty, 
which I found absolutely bizarre be-
cause everybody knows he will not 
spend 1 minute in prison or jail from 
conviction on these charges. It is a 
civil remedy to protect all of us—to 
protect the entire country, our chil-
dren, our Constitution, our future. 
That is what impeachment trial con-
victions are all about—are all about. 
Julian Bond—see, I knew Julian 
Bond, so forgive me. Most people say: 
Don’t even respond to this stuff. I have 
got to respond to this. Julian Bond was 
a civil rights activist who decided to go 
into politics, like the people in this 
room, like all of us who are in politics. 
And they tried to keep him out. He was 
a member of SNCC, the Student Non-
violent 
Coordinating 
Committee, 
which really launched the voting rights 
movement in America. It is a great 
story that Bob Moses tells in his book 
called ‘‘Radical Equations’’ about—you 
know, he was a graduate student, 
mathematics, at Harvard. He was a 
graduate student in mathematics at 
Harvard. He went to Mississippi. You 
know why? Because he saw a picture in 
the New York Times of Black civil 
rights protesters, college students, I 
think, North Carolina A&T. He saw a 
picture of them on the cover of the 
New York Times, and they were sitting 
in at a lunch counter. He looked at the 
picture, and he said: They looked the 
way that I felt. They looked the way 
that I felt. 
He said he had to go down south to 
Mississippi, and they launched the vot-
ing rights movement. That is where 
the 
phrase 
‘‘One-person, 
one-vote’’ 
comes from. It was not invented by the 
Supreme Court. They would go door-to- 
door to try to register people to vote. 
But anyway, Julian Bond was a part 
of that movement, the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee—non-
violence. It was the end, and it was the 
means—nonviolence. 
And he ran for the State legislature 
in Georgia, a path other civil rights ac-
tivists followed, like our great, late, 
beloved colleague John Lewis, who is 
in our hearts today. And when he got 
elected, they wanted to try to keep 
him from being sworn in to the Georgia 
Legislature. And so they said the Stu-
dent Nonviolent Coordinating Com-
mittee is taking a position against the 
Vietnam war. You are a member of 
SNCC. We are not going to admit you 
because you took a position against 
the Vietnam war. And the Supreme 
Court, in its wisdom, said you cannot 
prevent someone from swearing an 
oath to become a member of a legisla-
tive body because of a position that 
they took or a group they were part 
of—took before they got sworn in. 
That is the exact opposite of Donald 
Trump. He got elected to office. He 
swore an oath to the Constitution to 
preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution. He served as President for 4 
years, right up until the end, when he 
wanted to exercise his rights under the 
imaginary January exception, and he 
incited a violent mob and insurrection 
to come up here, and we all know what 
happened.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S733 
February 13, 2021 
He is being impeached and convicted 
for violating his oath of office that he 
took. He is not being prevented from 
taking his oath in the first place. 
The First Amendment is on our side. 
He tried to overturn the will of the 
people, the voice of the people. He lost 
that election by more than 7 million 
votes. Some people don’t want to admit 
it. Counsel for the President could not 
bring themselves to admit that the 
election is over in answer to the ques-
tion from the distinguished gentleman 
from Vermont. He refused to answer 
that. He said it was irrelevant, despite 
all of the evidence you have heard 
about the big lie and how that set the 
stage for his incitement of the insur-
rectionary violence against us. 
The First Amendment is on our side. 
We are defending the Bill of Rights. We 
are defending the constitutional struc-
ture. We are defending the separation 
of powers. We are defending the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House against a 
President who acted no better than a 
marauder and a member of that mob by 
inciting those people to come here. And 
in many ways, he was worse. He named 
the date; he named the time; and he 
brought them here; and now he must 
pay the price. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate is now ready to vote on the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment. And after that is 
done, we will adjourn the Court of Im-
peachment. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will read the Article of Impeach-
ment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Article I: Incitement of Insurrection. 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. Further, section 3 of the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution prohibits 
any person who has ‘‘engaged in insurrection 
or rebellion against’’ the United States from 
‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the United 
States’’. In his conduct while President of 
the United States—and in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
office of President of the United States and, 
to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional 
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed—Donald John Trump engaged in 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting 
violence against the Government of the 
United States, in that: 
On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, the Vice President of the 
United States, the House of Representatives, 
and the Senate met at the United States 
Capitol for a Joint Session of Congress to 
count the votes of the Electoral College. In 
the months preceding the Joint Session, 
President Trump repeatedly issued false 
statements asserting that the Presidential 
election results were the product of wide-
spread fraud and should not be accepted by 
the American people or certified by State or 
Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint 
Session commenced, President Trump, ad-
dressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Wash-
ington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims 
that ‘‘we won this election, and we won it by 
a landslide’’. He also willfully made state-
ments that, in context, encouraged—and 
foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the 
Capitol, such as: ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell 
you’re not going to have a country any-
more’’. Thus incited by President Trump, 
members of the crowd he had addressed, in 
an attempt to, among other objectives, 
interfere with the Joint Session’s solemn 
constitutional duty to certify the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully 
breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured 
and killed law enforcement personnel, men-
aced Members of Congress, the Vice Presi-
dent, and Congressional personnel, and en-
gaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, 
and seditious acts. 
President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 
2021, followed his prior efforts to subvert and 
obstruct the certification of the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior ef-
forts included a phone call on January 2, 
2021, during which President Trump urged 
the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad 
Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ enough votes to 
overturn the Georgia Presidential election 
results 
and 
threatened 
Secretary 
Raffensperger if he failed to do so. 
In all this, President Trump gravely en-
dangered the security of the United States 
and its institutions of Government. He 
threatened the integrity of the democratic 
system, interfered with the peaceful transi-
tion of power, and imperiled a coequal 
branch of Government. He thereby betrayed 
his trust as President, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such 
conduct, has demonstrated that he will re-
main a threat to national security, democ-
racy, and the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. Donald John Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States. 
VOTE ON ARTICLE I 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Each 
Senator, when his or her name is 
called, will stand in his or her place 
and vote guilty or not guilty, as re-
quired by rule XXIII of the Senate 
Rules on Impeachment. 
Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the 
Constitution regarding the vote re-
quired for conviction of impeachment 
provides that ‘‘no person shall be con-
victed without the concurrence of two- 
thirds of the Members present.’’ 
The question is on the Article of Im-
peachment. Senators, how say you? Is 
the respondent, Donald John Trump, 
guilty or not guilty? 
A rollcall vote is required. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Two-thirds of the Senators present 
not having voted guilty, the Senate ad-
judges that the respondent Donald 
John Trump, former President of the 
United States, is not guilty as charged 
in the Article of Impeachment. 
The Presiding Officer directs the 
judgment to be entered in accordance 
with the judgment of the Senate, as 
follows: 
The Senate, having tried Donald John 
Trump, former President of the United 
States, upon one Article of Impeachment ex-
hibited against him by the House of Rep-
resentatives, and two-thirds of the Senators 
present not having found him guilty of the 
charge contained therein, it is, therefore, or-
dered and adjudged that the said Donald 
John Trump be, and is hereby, acquitted of 
the charge in said Article. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
COMMUNICATION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
AND TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send 
an order to the desk.

provided by rule XXIII of the Rules of Proce-
dure and Practice in the Senate When Sit-

f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
case of Donald Trump’s second im-
peachment trial was open and shut. 
President Trump told a lie—a big 
lie—that the election was stolen and 
that he was the rightful winner. He 
laid the groundwork for this big lie in 
the months before the election. He told 
the big lie on election night, and he re-
peated the big lie more than 100 times 
in the weeks afterward. 
He 
summoned 
his 
supporters 
to 
Washington, assembled them on the El-
lipse, whipped them into a frenzy, and 
directed them at the Capitol. Then he 
watched as the violence unfolded and 
the Capitol was breached and his own 
Vice President fled for his life, and 
President Trump did nothing. 
None of these facts were up for de-
bate. We saw it. We heard it. We lived 
it. This was the first Presidential im-
peachment trial in history in which all 
Senators were not only judges and ju-
rors but witnesses to the constitu-
tional crime that was committed. The 
former President inspired, directed, 
and propelled a mob to violently pre-
vent the peaceful transfer of power, 
subvert the will of the people, and ille-
gally keep that President in power. 
There is nothing—nothing—more un- 
American than that. There is nothing— 
nothing—more antithetical to our de-
mocracy. There is nothing—nothing— 
more insulting to the generations of 
American patriots who gave their lives 
to defend our form of government. 
This was the most egregious viola-
tion of the Presidential oath of office 
and a textbook example, a classic ex-
ample of an impeachable offense, wor-
thy of the Constitution’s most severe 
remedy. 
In response to the incontrovertible 
fact of Donald Trump’s guilt, the Sen-
ate was subject to a feeble and some-
times incomprehensible defense of the 
former President. Unable to dispute 
the case on the merits, the former 
President’s counsel treated us to par-
tisan vitriol, false equivalence, and 
outright falsehoods. 
We heard the roundly debunked juris-
dictional argument that the Senate 
cannot try a former official, a position 
that would mean that any President 
could simply resign to avoid account-
ability for an impeachable offense, a 
position which, in effect, would render 
the Senate powerless to ever enforce 
the disqualification clause in the Con-
stitution. Essentially, the President’s 
counsel told the Senate that the Con-
stitution was unconstitutional. Thank-
fully, the Senate took a firm stance, 
set a firm precedent with a bipartisan 
vote in favor of our power to try 
former officials for acts they com-
mitted while in office. 
We heard the preposterous claim that 
the former President’s incitement to 
violence was protected by the First 
Amendment. The First Amendment 
right to free speech protects Americans 
from jail, not Presidents from im-
peachment. If the President had said 
during World War II, ‘‘Germany should 
attack the United States on Long Is-
land; we have left it undefended,’’ I sus-
pect Congress would have considered 
that an impeachable offense. 
Finally, defense counsel said that 
President Trump was not directly re-
sponsible for the violence at the Cap-
itol: 
His words were merely a metaphor; his di-
rections were merely suggestions; and the 
violent mob was just a spontaneous dem-
onstration. 
Yet wind the clock back, and ask 
yourself, if at any point Donald Trump 
did not do the things he did, would the 
attack on the Capitol have happened? 
There is only one answer to this ques-
tion: Of course not. If President Trump 
hadn’t told his supporters to march to 
the Capitol, if he hadn’t implored them 
to come to Washington on January 6 in 
the first place, if he hadn’t repeatedly 
lied to them that the election was sto-
len and their country was being taken 
from them, the attack would not have 
happened, could not have happened. 
January 6 would not have happened but 
for the actions of Donald Trump. 
Here is what the Republican leader of 
the Senate said: The mob that per-
petrated the ‘‘failed insurrection’’ on 
January 6 ‘‘was provoked by President 
Trump.’’ Do you want another word for 
‘‘provoke’’? How about ‘‘incite’’? Yet 
still—still—the vast majority of the 
Senate Republican caucus, including 
the Republican leader, voted to acquit 
former President Trump, signing their 
names in the columns of history along-
side his name forever. 
January 6 will live as a day of infamy 
in the history of the United States of 
America. The failure to convict Donald 
Trump will live as a vote of infamy in 
the history of the U.S. Senate. 
Five years ago, Republican Senators 
lamented what might become of their 
party if Donald Trump became their 
Presidential nominee and standard- 
bearer. Just look at what has hap-
pened. Look at what Republicans have 
been forced to defend. Look at what 
Republicans have chosen to forgive. 
The former President tried to overturn 
the results of a legitimate election and 
provoked an assault on our own gov-
ernment, and well over half the Senate 
Republican conference decided to con-
done it—the most despicable act that 
any President has ever committed, and 
the majority of Republicans cannot 
summon the courage or the morality to 
condemn it. 
This trial wasn’t about choosing 
country over party, even not that; this 
was about choosing country over Don-
ald Trump, and 43 Republican Members 
chose Trump. They chose Trump. It 
should be a weight on their conscience 
today, and it shall be a weight on their 
conscience in the future. 
As sad as that fact is, as condem-
nable as the decision was, it is still 
true that the final vote on Donald 
Trump’s conviction was the largest and 
most bipartisan vote of any Presi-
dential impeachment trial in American 
history. 
I salute those Republican patriots 
who did the right thing. It wasn’t easy. 
We know that. Let their votes be a 
message to the American people be-
cause, my fellow Americans, if this Na-
tion is going to long endure, we as a 
people cannot sanction the former 
President’s conduct, because if lying 
about the results of an election is ac-
ceptable, if instigating a mob against 
the government is considered permis-
sible, if encouraging political violence 
becomes the norm, it will be open sea-
son—open season—on our democracy, 
and everything will be up for grabs by 
whoever has the biggest clubs, the 
sharpest spears, the most powerful 
guns. By not recognizing the heinous 
crime that Donald Trump committed 
against the Constitution, Republican 
Senators have not only risked but po-
tentially invited the same danger that 
was just visited upon us. 
So let me say this: Despite the re-
sults of the vote on Donald Trump’s 
conviction in the Court of Impeach-
ment, he deserves to be convicted, and 
I believe he will be convicted in the 
court of public opinion. He deserves to 
be permanently discredited, and I be-
lieve he has been discredited in the 
eyes of the American people and in the 
judgment of history. 
Even though Republican Senators 
prevented the Senate from disquali-
fying Donald Trump for any office of 
honor, trust, or profit under these 
United States, there is no question 
Donald Trump has disqualified himself. 
I hope, I pray, and I believe that the 
American people will make sure of 
that. If Donald Trump ever stands for

public office again, and after every-
thing we have seen this week, I hope, I 
pray, and I believe that he will meet 
the unambiguous rejection by the 
American people. 
Six hours after the attack on Janu-
ary 6, after the carnage and mayhem 
was shown on every television screen 
in America, President Trump told his 
supporters to ‘‘Remember this day for-
ever.’’ I ask the American people to 
heed his words. Remember that day 
forever but not for the reasons the 
former President intended. Remember 
the panic in the voices over the radio 
dispatch, the rhythmic pounding of 
fists and flags at the Chamber doors. 
Remember the crack of a solitary gun-
shot. Remember the hateful and racist 
Confederate flag flying through the 
halls of our Union. Remember the 
screams of the bloody officer crushed 
between the onrushing mob and a door-
way to the Capitol, his body trapped in 
the breach. Remember three Capitol 
Police officers who lost their lives. Re-
member that those rioters actually 
succeeded in delaying Congress from 
certifying the election. Remember how 
close our democracy came to ruin. 
My fellow Americans, remember that 
day, January 6, forever, the final, ter-
rible legacy of the 45th President of the 
United States and undoubtedly our 
worst. Let it live on in infamy, a stain 
on Donald John Trump that can never, 
never be washed away. 
On Monday we will recognize Presi-
dents Day. Part of the commemoration 
in the Senate will be the annual read-
ing of Washington’s Farewell Address. 
Aside from winning the Revolutionary 
War, I consider it his greatest con-
tribution to American civil life, and it 
had nothing to do with the words he 
spoke but the example it set. 
Washington’s Farewell Address es-
tablished for all time that no one had 
the right to the Office of the Presi-
dency, that it belonged to the people. 
What an amazing legacy. What an 
amazing gift to the future generations, 
the knowledge that this country will 
always be greater than any one person, 
even our most renowned. That is why 
Members of both parties take turns 
reading Washington’s address once a 
year in full into the RECORD, to pledge 
common attachment to the selflessness 
at the core of our democratic system. 
This trial was about the final acts of 
a President who represents the very 
antithesis of our first President and 
sought to place one man before the en-
tire country: himself. 
Let the record show—let the record 
show before God, history, and the sol-
emn oath we swear to the Constitution 
that there was only one correct verdict 
in this trial: guilty. And I pray that 
while justice was not done in this trial, 
it will be carried forward by the Amer-
ican people, who, above any of us in 
this Chamber, determine the destiny of 
our great Nation.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
January 6 was a disgrace. American 
citizens attacked their own govern-
ment. They used terrorism to try to 
stop a specific piece of domestic busi-
ness they did not like. Fellow Ameri-
cans beat and bloodied our own police. 
They stormed the Senate floor. They 
tried to hunt down the Speaker of the 
House. 
They 
built 
a 
gallows 
and 
chanted about murdering the Vice 
President. They did this because they 
had been fed wild falsehoods by the 
most powerful man on Earth because 
he was angry he lost an election. 
Former President Trump’s actions 
preceding the riot were a disgraceful— 
disgraceful—dereliction of duty. 
The House accused the former Presi-
dent of ‘‘incitement.’’ That is a specific 
term from the criminal law. 
Let me just put that aside for a mo-
ment and reiterate something I said 
weeks ago. There is no question— 
none—that President Trump is prac-
tically and morally responsible for pro-
voking the events of the day. No ques-
tion about it. The people who stormed 
this building believed they were acting 
on the wishes and instructions of their 
President, and having that belief was a 
foreseeable consequence of the growing 
crescendo of false statements, con-
spiracy theories, and reckless hyper-
bole which the defeated President kept 
shouting into the largest megaphone 
on planet Earth. 
The issue is not only the President’s 
intemperate language on January 6. It 
is not just his endorsement of remarks 
in which an associate urged ‘‘trial by 
combat.’’ It was also the entire manu-
factured atmosphere of looming catas-
trophe; the increasingly wild myths— 
myths—about a reverse landslide elec-
tion that was somehow being stolen in 
some secret coup by our now-President. 
Now, I defended the President’s right 
to bring any complaints to our legal 
system. The legal system spoke. The 
electoral college spoke. As I stood up 
and said clearly at that time, the elec-
tion was settled. It was over. But that 
just really opened a new chapter of 
even 
wilder—wilder—and 
more 
un-
founded claims. 
The leader of the free world cannot 
spend weeks thundering that shadowy 
forces are stealing our country and 
then feign surprise when people believe 
him and do reckless things. 
Now, sadly, many politicians some-
times make overheated comments or 
use metaphors—we saw that—that un-
hinged listeners might take literally, 
but that was different. That is different 
from what we saw. This was an inten-
sifying crescendo of conspiracy theo-
ries, 
orchestrated 
by 
an 
outgoing 
President who seemed determined to 
either overturn the voters’ decision or 
else torch our institutions on the way 
out. 
The unconscionable behavior did not 
end when the violence actually began. 
Whatever our ex-President claims he 
thought might happen that day, what-
ever reaction he says he meant to 
produce, by that afternoon, we know he 
was watching the same live television 
as the rest of us. A mob was assaulting 
the Capitol in his name. These crimi-
nals were carrying his banners, hang-
ing his flags, and screaming their loy-
alty to him. 
It was obvious that only President 
Trump could end this. He was the only 
one who could. Former aides publicly 
begged him to do so. Loyal allies fran-
tically called the administration. The 
President did not act swiftly. He did 
not do his job. He didn’t take steps so 
Federal law could be faithfully exe-
cuted and order restored. No. Instead, 
according to public reports, he watched 
television 
happily—happily—as 
the 
chaos unfolded. He kept pressing his 
scheme to overturn the election. 
Now, even after it was clear to any 
reasonable observer that Vice Presi-
dent Pence was in serious danger, even 
as the mob carrying Trump banners 
was beating cops and breaching perim-
eters, the President sent a further 
tweet attacking his own Vice Presi-
dent. Now, predictably and foreseeably 
under the circumstances, members of 
the mob seemed to interpret this as a 
further inspiration to lawlessness and 
violence, not surprisingly. 
Later, even when the President did 
halfheartedly begin calling for peace, 
he didn’t call right away for the riot to 
end. He did not tell the mob to depart 
until even later. And even then, with 
police officers bleeding and broken 
glass covering Capitol floors, he kept 
repeating election lies and praising the 
criminals. 
In recent weeks, our ex-President’s 
associates have tried to use the 74 mil-
lion Americans who voted to reelect 
him as a kind of human shield against 
criticism—using the 74 million who 
voted for him as kind of a human 
shield against criticism. Anyone who 
decries his awful behavior is accused of 
insulting millions of voters. That is an 
absurd deflection. Seventy-four million 
Americans did not invade the Capitol. 
Hundreds of rioters did. Seventy-four 
million Americans did not engineer the 
campaign of disinformation and rage 
that provoked it. One person did it— 
just one. 
Now, I have made my view of this 
episode very plain. But our system of 
government gave the Senate a specific 
task. The Constitution gives us a par-
ticular role. This body is not invited to 
act as the Nation’s overarching moral 
tribunal. We are not free to work back-
ward from whether the accused party 
might personally deserve some kind of 
punishment. 
Justice Joseph Story was our Na-
tion’s first great constitutional schol-
ar. As he explained nearly 200 years

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S736 
February 13, 2021 
ago, the process of impeachment and 
conviction is a narrow tool—a narrow 
tool—for a narrow purpose. Story ex-
plained this limited tool exists to ‘‘se-
cure the state against gross official 
misdemeanors’’; that is, to protect the 
country from government officers. 
If President Trump were still in of-
fice, I would have carefully considered 
whether the House managers proved 
their specific charge. By the strict 
criminal 
standard, 
the 
President’s 
speech probably was not incitement. 
However—however—in the context of 
impeachment, the Senate might have 
decided this was acceptable shorthand 
for the reckless actions that preceded 
the riot. But in this case, the question 
is 
moot 
because 
former 
President 
Trump is constitutionally not eligible 
for conviction. 
Now, this is a close question, no 
doubt. Donald Trump was the Presi-
dent when the House voted, though not 
when the House chose to deliver the pa-
pers. Brilliant scholars argue both 
sides of this jurisdictional question. 
The text is legitimately ambiguous. I 
respect my colleagues who reached ei-
ther conclusion. 
But after intense reflection, I believe 
the best constitutional reading shows 
that article II, section 4 exhausts the 
set of persons who can legitimately be 
impeached, tried, or convicted. It is the 
President. It is the Vice President and 
civil officers. We have no power to con-
vict and disqualify a former office 
holder who is now a private citizen. 
Here is article II, section 4: ‘‘The 
President, Vice President and all civil 
Officers of the United States, shall be 
removed from Office on Impeachment 
for, and Conviction of, Treason, Brib-
ery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ 
Now, everyone basically agrees that 
the second half of that sentence ex-
hausts the legitimate grounds for con-
viction. The debates around the Con-
stitution’s framing make that abun-
dantly clear. Congress cannot convict 
for reasons besides those. It therefore 
follows that the list of persons in that 
same 
sentence 
is 
also 
exhaustive. 
There is no reason why one list—one 
list—would be exhaustive but the other 
would not. 
Article II, section 4 must limit both 
why impeachment and conviction can 
occur and to whom—and to whom. If 
this provision does not limit impeach-
ment and conviction powers, then it 
has no limits at all. The House’s ‘‘sole 
power of Impeachment’’ and the Sen-
ate’s ‘‘sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments’’ would create an unlimited cir-
cular logic, empowering Congress to 
ban any private citizen from Federal 
office. 
Now, that is an incredible claim. But 
it is the argument the House managers 
seemed to be making. One manager 
said the House and Senate have ‘‘abso-
lute, unqualified . . . jurisdictional 
power.’’ Well, that was very honest, be-
cause there is no limiting principle in 
the constitutional text that would em-
power the Senate to convict former of-
ficers that would not also let them con-
vict and disqualify any private cit-
izen—an absurd end result to which no 
one subscribes. 
Article II, section 4 must have force. 
It tells us the President, the Vice 
President and civil officers may be im-
peached and convicted. Donald Trump 
is no longer the President. 
Likewise, the provision states that 
officers subject to impeachment and 
conviction ‘‘shall be removed from Of-
fice if convicted’’—‘‘shall be removed 
from Office if convicted.’’ 
As Justice Story explained, ‘‘the Sen-
ate, [upon] conviction, [is] bound in all 
cases, to enter a judgment of removal 
from office.’’ Removal is mandatory 
upon conviction. Clearly, he explained, 
that mandatory sentence cannot be ap-
plied to someone who has left office. 
The entire process revolves around re-
moval. If removal becomes impossible, 
conviction becomes insensible. 
In one light, it certainly does seem 
counterintuitive that an officeholder 
can elude Senate conviction by res-
ignation or expiration of term—an ar-
gument we heard made by the man-
agers. But this underscores that im-
peachment was never meant to be the 
final forum for American justice— 
never meant to be the final forum for 
American justice. Impeachment, con-
viction, and removal are a specific 
intragovernmental safety valve. It is 
not the criminal justice system, where 
individual accountability is the para-
mount goal. 
Indeed, Justice Story specifically re-
minded that while former officials were 
not eligible for impeachment or convic-
tion, they were—and this is extremely 
important—‘‘still liable to be tried and 
punished in the ordinary tribunals of 
justice.’’ 
Put another way, in the language of 
today, President Trump is still liable 
for everything he did while he was in 
office, as an ordinary citizen—unless 
the statute of limitations is run, still 
liable for everything he did while he 
was in office. He didn’t get away with 
anything yet—yet. We have a criminal 
justice system in this country. We have 
civil litigation, and former Presidents 
are not immune from being account-
able by either one. 
I believe the Senate was right not to 
grab power the Constitution doesn’t 
give us, and the Senate was right not 
to entertain some light-speed sham 
process to try to outrun the loss of ju-
risdiction. 
It took both sides more than a week 
just to produce their pretrial briefs. 
Speaker PELOSI’s own scheduling deci-
sions conceded what President Biden 
publicly confirmed: A Senate verdict 
before Inauguration Day was never pos-
sible. 
Now, Mr. President, this has been a 
dispiriting time, but the Senate has 
done our duty. The Framers’ firewall 
held up again. On January 6, we re-
turned to our post and certified the 
election. We were uncowed. We were 
not intimidated. We finished the job. 
And, since then, we resisted the clamor 
to define our own constitutional guard-
rails in hot pursuit of a particular out-
come. We refused to continue a cycle of 
recklessness by straining our own con-
stitutional boundaries in response. 
The Senate’s decision today does not 
condone anything that happened on or 
before that terrible day. It simply 
shows that Senators did what the 
former President failed to do: We put 
our constitutional duty first. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take 
this time to explain why I voted to 
convict the former President of the 
United States, Donald Trump, of the 
Article of Impeachment presented by 
the House of Representatives in re-
gards to the incitement of insurrec-
tion. 
Throughout his Presidency, Donald 
J. Trump has violated his oath of office 
to preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States. 
There are many examples that I can 
give of how he has violated his oath of 
office. I could also cite the basis of the 
first Articles of Impeachment that 
were tried last year as violating his 
oath of office. But, by far, the most 
egregious violation of his oath of office 
took place in his incitement of insur-
rection that occurred with the attack 
on this Capitol on January 6. 
But it started well before January 6. 
The seeds were planted a long time ago 
and even before the November elec-
tions, when President Trump pointed 
out, when the polls were showing that 
he might lose in the election, that he 
refused to acknowledge that he would 
accept the election results if he lost. 
He didn’t say that once before the No-
vember elections, he said it on several 
occasions. He talked about a rigged 
election. He talked about a fraudulent 
election. He talked about the election 
being ‘‘taken away from us’’—the vic-
tory—with no evidence of voter fraud. 
One of the key provisions of our Con-
stitution, of our democracy, is the 
peaceful transition of power. Donald 
Trump called that into question prior 
to the November 3 elections. 
Then came the November 3 elections, 
and, shortly thereafter, Joe Biden was 
declared to be the winner. Why? Be-
cause he had the most votes—most 
populace votes—over 7 million. But he 
was declared the winner because of the 
electoral votes, 306 to 232. By the way, 
that is the same electoral margin that 
Donald Trump won 4 years earlier and 
which Donald Trump called a ‘‘land-
slide.’’ 
But then came the legal challenges 
by President Trump. He didn’t accept 
the electoral vote or the declared elec-
tions. And he has his right to contest 
the elections in the court by asking for 
recounts or asking for challenges, but 
in every one of those cases, he could

not establish widespread fraud that 
would have changed the results in any 
one of the States, let alone enough 
electoral vote changes to change the 
outcome of the election. 
But did he stop after he was denied 
relief in all of those legal challenges? 
The answer is no. He further contested 
by trying to inappropriately interfere 
with State election officials and State 
public officials, urging them to take 
action to change the certification re-
sults. 
Now, we have many examples that 
during this period of time he was talk-
ing about a fraudulent election, a sto-
len election, all the different things 
about raising questions as to the legit-
imacy of the voices of people of this 
Nation. We have so many examples of 
his interference, but we actually have 
the tape of his conversation with the 
Georgia secretary of state that we all 
heard and heard how the President 
tried to intimidate and threaten the 
secretary of state of Georgia in order 
to change the certified election results 
from the votes of the people of Geor-
gia—clear examples of how President 
Trump violated his oath of office to 
protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States. 
But that wasn’t the end of it. He 
went to his Department of Justice be-
lieving the Department of Justice is 
his Department of Justice, not the De-
partment of Justice of the United 
States of America. Now, let’s remem-
ber that the Department of Justice had 
found no widespread corruption. In 
fact, they had determined this was one 
of the freest elections and one of the 
least problem elections that we have 
had. It didn’t stop President Trump 
from trying to intimidate and order his 
Department of Justice to conduct an 
additional investigation to find fraud 
to overturn the will of the people—once 
again, violating his oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States. 
He continued to do this, contrary to 
his constitutional obligations. ‘‘Cor-
rupt 
election,’’ 
‘‘stop 
the 
steal,’’ 
‘‘rigged 
elections,’’ 
‘‘tremendous 
fraud’’—all words that he used after 
the November 3 election. He knew what 
he was saying was a lie. He knew there 
was no widespread fraud, but he contin-
ued to use the Office of the Presidency 
and his voice to promote the big lie, 
and he knew his followers would be-
lieve it. He knew he could convince his 
loyal followers to believe that this was 
a rigged election—a stolen election— 
again, compromising our democracy 
and the will of the people to determine 
who our leaders are. And he knew his 
followers would be motivated to action 
because he knew he could motivate his 
followers. 
He put himself before the Nation and 
before his responsibilities as President 
of the United States. He put his own 
self-interest above his responsibilities 
under the Constitution of the United 
States and to the people of this Nation. 
And then he summoned his loyal fol-
lowing to Washington on January 6. He 
knew they would come. He knew dan-
gerous people were in the group. He 
knew the Proud Boys were there, to 
which he had directly said: ‘‘Stand 
back and stand by.’’ He knew that they 
were ready for violent action. 
And then he incited the mob to ac-
tion on January 6. We know the words 
that he used. We saw the videos as part 
of the record of the impeachment trial. 
‘‘We will never surrender,’’ ‘‘we will 
never concede,’’ ‘‘we will stop the 
steal,’’ ‘‘stolen election’’—all words 
that he had been using during the en-
tire 2020 election cycle, particularly 
when he thought he was going to lose. 
But the most damning part of the 
President’s violation of his oath of of-
fice—the most serious part—is what he 
did and did not do after seeing the vio-
lence erupt in the United States Cap-
itol. After the Capitol was penetrated, 
after we saw the violence being com-
mitted, where we knew that the Mem-
bers of Congress were in danger, the 
Vice President of the United States 
was in danger, the people that work 
here were in danger, all the people that 
were in the Capitol legitimately were 
in danger—we all saw that—and the 
President of the United States knew 
that, and he did nothing to stop the vi-
olence. He could have called off his loy-
alists and told them to get out of the 
Capitol. He didn’t do that. He could 
have sent in the National Guard in 
order to protect us. He didn’t do that. 
And he never condemned the partici-
pants in this mob in penetrating the 
Capitol for what they did. 
I am going to sort of summarize my 
feeling about that by agreeing with 
Representative LIZ CHENEY, the House 
Republican caucus chair, who said it on 
the floor of the House. Let me just 
quote her statement: 
The President of the United States sum-
moned this mob, assembled this mob, and lit 
the flame of this attack. Everything that fol-
lowed was his doing. None of this would have 
happened without the President. The Presi-
dent could have immediately and forcefully 
intervened to stop the violence. He did not. 
There has never been a greater betrayal by a 
President of the United States of his office 
and his oath to the Constitution. 
I agree with that. President Trump 
violated his oath of office to protect 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. He violated that. 
But let’s take a look at what he did 
do after knowing the violence that oc-
curred—his tweet of 2:24 p.m. Now, this 
is after the Vice President had been re-
moved from presiding in the Chamber, 
after he knew the violence that was 
taking place in the Capitol of the 
United States. He was aware of all 
that. He knew that we had shut down 
the operations of the House and the 
Senate, that there was violence taking 
place within the Capitol, and that his 
Vice President was the target of that 
attack. And what he tweeted at 2:24 
p.m.—I am quoting the President: 
‘‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage 
to do what should have been done to 
protect our country.’’ He inflamed the 
group even more to violence after he 
knew 
that 
it 
was 
a 
violent 
cir-
cumstance. 
He had known violence had taken 
place, and we heard put into the record 
of the impeachment trial today Con-
gresswoman Beutler’s report of Major-
ity Leader MCCARTHY’s conversation, 
which, again, is during this period of 
time. Here we are. The Republican 
leader of the House of Representatives 
gets the President on the phone. He 
says: Mr. President, we are being at-
tacked. My office is being broken into. 
We need help. Send the Guard. Take 
care of us. 
And 
then 
President 
Trump 
said 
something like: Well, it is not my sup-
porters. It is some leftwing group. 
And Leader MCCARTHY said: No, Mr. 
President, these are your supporters 
who are doing this. 
And what did the leader say? What 
did the President say? I guess, KEVIN, 
these people are more upset about the 
election than you are. 
Here we have the Members of Con-
gress in harm’s way, and the President 
is talking about the support for those 
who are causing the violence and put-
ting his own interest above the safety 
of the people whom he is sworn to pro-
tect as our Commander in Chief. 
And then, at the end of the day, 
about 6 o’clock, he sends out a tweet 
that really sums up his feelings about 
what these people were doing. Now, 
these are people who came into the 
Capitol. They killed people. They hurt 
people. They stole property. They dam-
aged property. They invaded the Cap-
itol of the United States. They hurt 
law enforcement officers. They hurt all 
of us. They hurt our democracy. So 
how does the President sum up the 
day? His tweet: 
These are the things that happen when a 
sacred 
landslide 
victory 
is 
so 
unceremoniously 
and 
viciously 
stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go 
home with love & in peace. Remember this 
day forever! 
He was repeating the big lie and say-
ing the day was a day of celebration 
when it was one of the bleakest days, 
dark days in the history of our Nation. 
That is what President Trump did, 
rather than bringing in the National 
Guard, rather than telling his people to 
go home, rather than being concerned 
about the safety of the Vice President 
and the Members of Congress as the 
President of the United States should 
have been doing. 
He violated his oath of office over 
and over and over again—a pattern of 
practice that we have seen for so long. 
It clearly establishes that he incited an 
insurrection against our country—that 
the facts included as a basis for the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment brought to us by 
the House of Representatives have been 
proven. 
The purpose of impeachment is not 
just the accountability for the Presi-
dent but also to protect our Constitu-
tion and to make sure this conduct 
never happens again. No one is above

the law, including the President of the

sponsible for the insurrection that oc-
curred on January 6 should be held ac-
countable—from those who broke into 
the Capitol and caused the harm and 
damage to the President of the United 
States who incited the violence.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
hallmark of our American democracy 
is the peaceful transfer of power after 
the voters choose their leaders. In 
America, we accept election results 
even if our candidate does not prevail. 
If a candidate believes that there is 
fraud, the courts can hear and decide 
those issues. Otherwise, the authority 
to govern is vested in the duly elected 
officials. 
On January 6, this Congress gathered 
in the Capitol to count the votes of the 
electoral college, pursuant to the proc-
ess set forth in the 12th Amendment to 
the Constitution. At the same time, a 
mob stormed the Capitol, determined 
to stop Congress from carrying out our 
constitutional duty. 
That attack was not a spontaneous 
outbreak of violence. Rather, it was 
the culmination of a steady stream of 
provocations by President Trump that 
were aimed at overturning the results 
of the Presidential election. 
The President’s unprecedented ef-
forts to discredit the election results 
did not begin on January 6. Rather, he 
planted the seeds of doubt many weeks 
before votes were cast on November 3. 
He repeatedly told his supporters that 
only a rigged election could cause him 
to lose. 
Thus began President Trump’s cru-
sade to undermine public confidence in 
the Presidential election unless he 
won. 
Early in the morning of November 4, 
as the ballots continued to be counted, 
President Trump claimed victory and 
asserted that Democrats were trying to 
steal the election. 
On November 8, the day after several 
media outlets had declared Joe Biden 
the apparent winner based on State-by- 
State 
results, 
President 
Trump 
tweeted: 
This was a stolen election. 
With that, his postelection campaign 
to change the outcome began. 
Over the ensuing days and months, 
the President distorted the results of 
the election, continuing to claim that 
he had won, while court after court 
threw out his lawsuits and States con-
tinued to certify their results. Presi-
dent Trump’s falsehoods convinced a 
large number of Americans that he had 
won and that they were being cheated. 
The President also embarked on an 
incredible effort to pressure State elec-
tion officials to change the results in 
their States. The most egregious exam-
ple occurred on January 2. In an ex-
traordinary 
phone 
call, 
President 
Trump could be heard alternating be-
tween lobbying, cajoling, intimidating, 
and threatening the election officials 
in Georgia. ‘‘I just want to find 11,708 
votes,’’ he stated, seeking the exact 
number of votes needed to change the 
outcome in that State. Despite the 
President’s pleas and threats, the Geor-
gia officials refused to yield to the 
Presidential pressure, as did State offi-
cials in other States. 
In 
December, 
President 
Trump’s 
postelection campaign became focused 
on January 6, the day that Congress 
was scheduled to count the electoral 
college votes. Although this counting 
is a ceremonial and administrative act, 
it is nevertheless the constitutionally 
mandated final step in the electoral 
college and the electoral process, and 
it must occur before a new President 
can be inaugurated. 
On December 19, President Trump 
tweeted to his supporters: 
Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be 
there, will be wild! 
In response, some of his campaign 
supporters changed the date for protest 
rallies they originally had scheduled to 
occur after the inauguration to happen 
instead on January 6. 
Having failed to persuade the courts 
and State election officials, President 
Trump next began to pressure Vice 
President Pence to use his role under 
the 12th Amendment to overturn the 
election. The President met with Vice 
President Pence on January 5 and then 
increased the pressure by tweeting 
hours later: 
If [the Vice President] comes through for 
us, we will win the Presidency. 
That is what his tweet said. 
Vice President Pence, however, re-
fused to yield. He issued a public letter 
on January 6 making clear that his 
oath to support and defend the Con-
stitution would prevent him from uni-
laterally deciding which electoral vote 
should be counted and which should 
not. 
During his speech at the Ellipse on 
January 6, President Trump kept up 
that drumbeat of pressure on Vice 
President Pence. In front of a large, 
agitated crowd, he urged the Vice 
President to ‘‘stand up for the good of 
our Constitution.’’ ‘‘I hope Mike has 
the courage to do what he has to do,’’ 
President Trump concluded. Rather 
than facilitating the peaceful transfer 
of power, President Trump was telling 
Vice President Pence to ignore the 
Constitution and to refuse to count the 
certified votes. He was also further agi-
tating the crowd, directing them to 
march to the Capitol. 
In this situation, context was every-
thing. Tossing a lit match into a pile of 
dry leaves is very different from toss-
ing it into a pool of water. And on Jan-
uary 6, the atmosphere among the 
crowd outside the White House was 
highly combustible, largely the result 
of an ill wind blowing from Washington 
for the past 2 months. 
President Trump had stoked dis-
content with a steady barrage of false 
claims that the election had been sto-
len from him. The allegedly responsible 
officials were denigrated, scorned, and 
ridiculed by the President, with the 
predictable result that his supporters 
viewed any official they perceived to be 
an obstacle to President Trump’s re-
election as an enemy of their cause. 
That set the stage for the storming of 
the Capitol for the first time in more 
than 200 years. 
Nearly 30 minutes after the Capitol 
first came under attack, Members of 
Congress, law enforcement, and every-
one else here in the Capitol waited in 
vein for the President to unequivocally 
condemn the violence and tell his mis-
guided supporters to leave the Capitol. 
Rather than demand an end to the vio-
lence, President Trump expressed his 
frustration once again that the Vice 
President had not stopped the vote cer-
tification as he had urged. 
Shortly after the Vice President was 
whisked away from this very Chamber 
to avoid the menacing mob chanting 
‘‘Hang Mike Pence,’’ President Trump 
tweeted: 
Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do 
what should have been done. 
Instead of preventing a dangerous 
situation, President Trump created 
one. 
Rather than defend the constitu-
tional transfer of power, he incited an 
insurrection with the purpose of pre-
venting that transfer of power from oc-
curring. 
Whether by design or by virtue of a 
reckless disregard for the consequences 
of his action, President Trump, subor-
dinating the interests of the country to 
his own selfish interest, bears signifi-
cant responsibility for the invasion of 
the Capitol. 
This impeachment trial is not about 
any single word uttered by President 
Trump on January 6, 2021; it is instead 
about President Trump’s failure to 
obey the oath he swore on January 20, 
2017. His actions to interfere with the 
peaceful transition of power, the hall-
mark of our Constitution and our 
American democracy, were an abuse of 
power and constitute grounds for con-
viction. 
Two arguments have been made 
against conviction that deserve com-
ment. The first is that this was a snap 
impeachment, that the House failed to 
hold hearings, conduct an investiga-
tion, and to interview witnesses, and 
that is true. Without a doubt, the 
House should have been more thor-
ough. It should have compiled a more 
complete 
record. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
record is clear that the President, 
President Trump, abused his power, 
violated his oath to uphold the Con-
stitution, 
and 
tried 
almost

means in his power to prevent the 
peaceful transfer of authority to the 
newly elected President. 
Second is the contention that the 
First Amendment protects the Presi-
dent’s right to make any sort of out-
rageous and false claims, no matter the 
consequences. 
(Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.) 
But the First Amendment was not 
designed and must never be construed 
by any court to bar the impeachment 
and conviction of an official who vio-
lates his oath of office by summoning 
and inciting a mob to threaten other 
officials in the discharge of their con-
stitutional obligations. 
My vote in this trial stems from my 
own oath and duty to defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. The 
abuse of power and betrayal of his oath 
by President Trump meet the constitu-
tional standard of high crimes and mis-
demeanors, and for those reasons, I 
voted to convict Donald J. Trump.

SENATE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
COMMITTEE
RULES— 
117TH CONGRESS 
JURISDICTION 
Per Rule XXV(1) of the Standing Rules of 
the Senate: 
(1) Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship to which committee shall be 
referred all proposed legislation, messages, 
petitions, memorials, and other matters re-
lating to the Small Business Administration; 
(2) Any proposed legislation reported by 
such committee which relates to matters 
other than the functions of the Small Busi-
ness Administration shall, at the request of 
the chairman of any standing committee 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter 
extraneous to the functions of the Small 
Business Administration, be considered and 
reported by such standing committee prior 
to its consideration by the Senate; and like-
wise measures reported by other committees 
directly relating to the Small Business Ad-
ministration shall, at the request of the 
Chair of the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, be referred to the 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship for its consideration of any portion 
of the measure dealing with the Small Busi-
ness Administration and be reported by this 
committee prior to its consideration by the 
Senate. 
(3) Such committee shall also study and 
survey by means of research and investiga-
tion all problems of American small business 
enterprises, and report thereon from time to 
time. 
RULES OF PROCEDURE 
General 
All applicable provisions of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, the Senate Resolutions, 
and the Legislative Reorganization Acts of 
1946 and of 1970 (as amended), shall govern 
the Committee. 
Meetings 
(a) The regular meeting day of the Com-
mittee shall be the first Wednesday of each 
month unless otherwise directed by the 
Chair. All other meetings may be called by 
the Chair as he or she deems necessary, on 5 
business days notice where practicable. If at 
least three Members of the Committee desire 
the Chair to call a special meeting, they may 
file in the office of the Committee a written 
request therefore, addressed to the Chair. 
Immediately thereafter, the Clerk of the 
Committee shall notify the Chair of such re-
quest. If, within 3 calendar days after the fil-
ing of such request, the Chair fails to call 
the requested special meeting, which is to be 
held within 7 calendar days after the filing of 
such request, a majority of the Committee 
Members may file in the Office of the Com-
mittee their written notice that a special 
Committee meeting will be held, specifying 
the date, hour and place thereof, and the 
Committee shall meet at that time and 
place. Immediately upon the filing of such 
notice, the Clerk of the Committee shall no-
tify all Committee Members that such spe-
cial meeting will be held and inform them of 
its date, hour and place. If the Chair is not 
present at any regular, additional or special 
meeting, such member of the Committee as 
the Chair shall designate shall preside. For 
any meeting or hearing of the Committee, 
the Ranking Member may delegate to any 
Minority Member the authority to serve as 
Ranking Member, and that Minority Member 
shall be afforded all the rights and respon-
sibilities of the Ranking Member for the du-
ration of that meeting or hearing. Notice of 
any designation shall be provided to the 
Chief Clerk as early as practicable. 
(b) It shall not be in order for the Com-
mittee to consider any amendment in the 
first degree proposed to any measure under 
consideration by the Committee unless an 
electronic copy of such amendment has been 
delivered to the Clerk of the Committee at 
least 2 business days prior to the meeting. 
Following receipt of all amendments, the 
Clerk shall disseminate the amendments to 
all Members of the Committee. This sub-
section may be waived by agreement of the 
Chair and Ranking Member or by a majority 
vote of the members of the Committee. 
Quorums 
(a)(1) A majority of the Members of the 
Committee shall constitute a quorum for re-
porting any legislative measure or nomina-
tion. 
(2) One-third of the Members of the Com-
mittee shall constitute a quorum for the 
transaction of routine business, provided 
that one Minority Member is present. The 
term ‘‘routine business’’ includes, but is not 
limited to, the consideration of legislation 
pending before the Committee and any 
amendments thereto, and voting on such 
amendments, and steps in an investigation 
including, but not limited to, authorizing 
the issuance of a subpoena. 
(3) In hearings, whether in public or closed 
session, a quorum for the asking of testi-
mony, including sworn testimony, shall con-
sist of one Member of the Committee. 
(b) Proxies will be permitted in voting 
upon the business of the Committee. A Mem-
ber who is unable to attend a business meet-
ing may submit a proxy vote on any matter, 
in writing, or though oral or written per-
sonal instructions to a Member of the Com-
mittee or staff. Proxies shall in no case be 
counted for establishing a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S741 
February 13, 2021 
Nominations 
In considering a nomination, the Com-
mittee shall conduct an investigation or re-
view of the nominee’s experience, qualifica-
tions, suitability, and integrity to serve in 
the position to which he or she has been 
nominated. In any hearings on the nomina-
tion, the nominee shall be called to testify 
under oath on all matters relating to his or 
her nomination for office. To aid in such in-
vestigation or review, each nominee may be 
required to submit a sworn detailed state-
ment including biographical, financial, pol-
icy, and other information which the Com-
mittee may request. The Committee may 
specify which items in such statement are to 
be received on a confidential basis. 
Hearings, Subpoenas, & Legal Counsel 
(a)(1) The Chair of the Committee may ini-
tiate a hearing of the Committee on his or 
her authority or upon his or her approval of 
a request by any Member of the Committee. 
If such request is by the Ranking Member, a 
decision shall be communicated to the Rank-
ing Member within 7 business days. Written 
notice of all hearings, including the title, a 
description of the hearing, and a tentative 
witness list shall be given at least 5 business 
days in advance, where practicable, to all 
Members of the Committee. 
(2) Hearings of the Committee shall not be 
scheduled outside the District of Columbia 
unless specifically authorized by the Chair 
and the Ranking Minority Member or by 
consent of a majority of the Committee. 
Such consent may be given informally, with-
out a meeting, but must be in writing. 
(b)(1) Any Member of the Committee shall 
be empowered to administer the oath to any 
witness testifying as to fact. 
(2) The Chair and Ranking Member shall be 
empowered to call an equal number of wit-
nesses to a Committee hearing. Subject to 
Senate Standing Rule 26(4)(d), such number 
shall exclude any Administration witness 
unless such witness would be the sole hear-
ing witness, in which case the Ranking Mem-
ber shall be entitled to invite one witness. 
The preceding two sentences shall not apply 
when a witness appears as the nominee. In-
terrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be 
conducted on behalf of the Committee by 
Members of the Committee or such Com-
mittee staff as is authorized by the Chair or 
Ranking Minority Member. 
(3) Witnesses appearing before the Com-
mittee shall file with the Clerk of the Com-
mittee a written statement of the prepared 
testimony at least two business days in ad-
vance of the hearing at which the witness is 
to appear unless this requirement is waived 
by the Chair and the Ranking Minority 
Member. 
(c) Any witness summoned to a public or 
closed hearing may be accompanied by coun-
sel of his or her own choosing, who shall be 
permitted while the witness is testifying to 
advise the witness of his or her legal rights. 
Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the 
witness from appearing and testifying. 
(d) Subpoenas for the attendance of wit-
nesses or the production of memoranda, doc-
uments, records, and other materials may be 
authorized by the Chair with the consent of 
the Ranking Minority Member or by the con-
sent of a majority of the Members of the 
Committee. Such consent may be given in-
formally, without a meeting, but must be in 
writing. The Chair may subpoena attendance 
or production without the consent of the 
Ranking Minority Member when the Chair 
has not received notification from the Rank-
ing Minority Member of disapproval of the 
subpoena within 72 hours of being notified of 
the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays. Subpoenas shall be 
issued by the Chair or by the Member of the 
Committee designated by him or her. A sub-
poena for the attendance of a witness shall 
state briefly the purpose of the hearing and 
the matter or matters to which the witness 
is expected to testify. A subpoena for the 
production 
of 
memoranda, 
documents, 
records, and other materials shall identify 
the papers or materials required to be pro-
duced with as much particularity as is prac-
ticable. 
(e) The Chair shall rule on any objections 
or assertions of privilege as to testimony or 
evidence in response to subpoenas or ques-
tions of Committee Members and staff in 
hearings. 
(f) Testimony may be submitted to the for-
mal record for a period not less than two 
weeks following a hearing or roundtable, un-
less otherwise agreed to by Chair and Rank-
ing Member. 
Confidential Information 
(a) No confidential testimony taken by, or 
confidential material presented to, the Com-
mittee in executive session, or any report of 
the proceedings of a closed hearing, or con-
fidential testimony or material submitted 
pursuant to a subpoena, shall be made pub-
lic, either in whole or in part or by way of 
summary, unless authorized by a majority of 
the Members. Other confidential material or 
testimony submitted to the Committee may 
be disclosed if authorized by the Chair with 
the consent of the Ranking Member. 
(b) Persons asserting confidentiality of 
documents or materials submitted to the 
Committee offices shall clearly designate 
them as such on their face. Designation of 
submissions as confidential does not prevent 
their use in furtherance of Committee busi-
ness. 
Media & Broadcasting 
(a) At the discretion of the Chair, public 
meetings of the Committee may be televised, 
broadcasted, or recorded in whole or in part 
by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or 
an employee of the Senate. Any such person 
wishing to televise, broadcast, or record a 
Committee meeting must request approval 
of the Chair by submitting a written request 
to the Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day 
before the meeting. Notice of televised or 
broadcasted hearings shall be provided to the 
Ranking Minority Member as soon as prac-
ticable. 
(b) During public meetings of the Com-
mittee, any person using a camera, micro-
phone, or other electronic equipment may 
not position or use the equipment in a way 
that interferes with the seating, vision, or 
hearing of Committee members or staff on 
the dais, or with the orderly process of the 
meeting. 
Subcommittees 
The Committee shall not have standing 
subcommittees. 
Amendment of Rules 
The foregoing rules may be added to, modi-
fied or amended; provided, however, that not 
less than a majority of the entire Member-
ship so determined at a regular meeting with 
due notice, or at a meeting specifically 
called for that purpose.

appearance at the hearing. 
(2) Any witness who fails to meet the dead-
line specified in paragraph (I) shall not be 
permitted to present testimony but may be

each witness appearing before the Com-
mittee. 
(E) The Chairman, with the concurrence of 
the Ranking Minority Member of the Com-
mittee, is authorized to subpoena the attend-
ance of witnesses and the production of 
memoranda, documents, records, and any 
other materials. If the Chairman or a Com-
mittee staff member designated by the 
Chairman has not received from the Ranking 
Minority Member or a Committee staff mem-
ber designated by the Ranking Minority 
Member notice of the Ranking Minority 
Member’s nonconcurrence in the subpoena 
within 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, 
Sundays, and federal holidays) of being noti-
fied of the Chairman’s intention to subpoena 
attendance or production, the Chairman is 
authorized following the end of the 48–hour 
period involved to subpoena the same with-
out the Ranking Minority Member’s concur-
rence. Regardless of whether a subpoena has 
been concurred in by the Ranking Minority 
Member, such subpoena may be authorized

When the Committee or Chairman authorizes 
a subpoena, the subpoena may be issued upon 
the signature of the Chairman or of any 
other Member of the Committee designated 
by the Chairman. 
(F) Except as specified in Committee Rule 
VII (requiring oaths, under certain cir-

will be required to give testimony under 
oath whenever the presiding Member deems 
such to be advisable. 
V. MEDIA COVERAGE 
Any Committee meeting or hearing which 
is open to the public may be covered by tele-
vision, radio, and print media. Photog-
raphers, reporters, and crew members using 
mechanical recording, filming, or broad-
casting devices shall position and use their 
equipment so as not to interfere with the 
seating, vision, or hearing of the Committee 
Members or staff or with the orderly conduct 
of the meeting or hearing. The presiding 
Member of the meeting or hearing may for 
good cause terminate, in whole or in part, 
the use of such mechanical devices or take 
such other action as the circumstances and 
the orderly conduct of the meeting or hear-
ing may warrant. 
VI. GENERAL 
All applicable requirements of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate shall govern the 
Committee. 
VII. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS 
(A) Each Presidential nominee whose nom-
ination is subject to Senate confirmation 
and referred to this Committee shall submit 
a statement of his or her background and fi-
nancial interests, including the financial in-
terests of his or her spouse and of children 
living in the nominee’s household, on a form 
approved by the Committee, which shall be 
sworn to as to its completeness and accu-
racy. The Committee form shall be in two 
parts: 
1) Information concerning employment, 
education, and background of the nominee, 
which generally relates to the position to 
which the individual is nominated and which 
is to be made public; and 
2) Information concerning the financial 
and other background of the nominee, to be 
made public when the Committee determines 
that such information bears directly on the 
nominee’s qualifications to hold the position 
to which the individual is nominated. 
(B) At any hearing to confirm a Presi-
dential nomination, the testimony of the 
nominee and, at the request of any Member, 
any other witness shall be under oath. 
(C) Committee action on a nomination, in-
cluding hearings or a meeting to consider a 
motion to recommend confirmation, shall 
not occur until at least five days (not count-
ing Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holi-
days) after the nominee submits with respect 
to the currently pending nomination the 
form required by this rule unless the Chair-
man, with the concurrence of the Ranking 
Minority Member, waives this waiting pe-
riod. 
VIII. NAMING OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
AFFAIRS FACILITIES 
It is the policy of the Committee that a 
Department of Veterans Affairs facility may 
be named only after a deceased individual 
and only under the following circumstances: 
(A) Such individual was: 
(1) A veteran who (i) was instrumental in 
the construction or the operation of the fa-
cility to be named, or (ii) was a recipient of 
the Medal of Honor or, as determined by the 
Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, 
otherwise performed military service of an 
extraordinarily distinguished character; 
(2) A Member of the United States House of 
Representatives or Senate who had a direct 
association with such facility; 
(3) An Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs, 
a Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a Secretary 
of Defense or of a service branch, or a mili-
tary or other Federal civilian official of com-
parable or higher rank; or 
(4) An individual who, as determined by 
the Chairman and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber, performed outstanding service for vet-
erans. 
(B) Each Member of the Congressional del-
egation representing the State in which the 
designated facility is located must indicate 
in writing such Member’s support of the pro-
posal to name such facility after such indi-
vidual. It is the policy of the Committee that 
sponsoring or cosponsoring legislation to 
name such facility after such individual will 
not alone satisfy this requirement. 
(C) The pertinent State department or 
chapter of each Congressionally chartered 
veterans’ organization having a national 
membership of at least 500,000 must indicate 
in writing its support of such proposal. 
Under certain circumstances, the Committee 
may grant a waiver to accept written sup-
port from pertinent chapters or posts of 
chartered veterans’ organizations in lieu of 
the State department. 
(D) The above criteria for naming a VA fa-
cility may be waived by unanimous consent. 
IX. AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES 
The rules of the Committee may be 
changed, modified, amended, or suspended at 
any time provided, however, that no less 
than a majority of the entire membership so 
determine at a regular meeting with due no-
tice or at a meeting specifically called for 
that purpose. The rules governing quorums 
for reporting legislative matters shall gov-
ern rules changes, modification, amend-
ments, or suspension. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
the Constitution reserves impeachment 
for cases of ‘‘treason, bribery, or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ Con-
gress must never take this action 
lightly and only in the most extreme 
circumstances. 
On January 13, the House of Rep-
resentatives voted 232–197 to impeach 
Donald Trump on a count of inciting 
the insurrection that took place on 
January 6. 
I have taken care over the past week 
to fulfill my charge as an impartial 
juror in this trial. I have listened care-
fully to the presentations made by 
both sides. And I believe the House im-
peachment managers proved the case 
that Donald Trump bears responsi-
bility for inciting the violence and the 
insurrection on January 6. 
I therefore cast my vote to convict 
him of the impeachment charge. The 
argument has been made that Donald 
Trump is no longer President, thus he 
cannot be removed from office, as he 
has already left. I understand the argu-
ment, but it fails on several counts. 
First, failure to act would set the 
precedent that a President can get 
away with anything at the end of his 
term. Relying on criminal proceedings 
in place of impeachment is insufficient; 
Congress must have the power to im-
peach, 
regardless 
of 
when 
actions 
occur. Indeed, the House approved the 
Article of Impeachment when Donald 
Trump was still president. 
Second, there is legitimate fear that, 
if allowed to run for office again, we 
could 
see 
an 
emboldened 
Trump 
wouldn’t hesitate to repeat the actions 
of January 6. If convicted, a simple ma-
jority vote would bar him from running 
for office. 
And third, a conviction would send a 
clear message to Trump’s followers, 
particularly the ones who accept vio-
lence as a legitimate means of protest, 
that perpetrators of insurrection and 
those who enabled them will be held re-
sponsible for their action. 
As 
impeachment 
manager 
DIANA 
DEGETTE said of the mob at the Cap-
itol: ‘‘All of these people who have been 
arrested and charged, they’re being ac-
countable, held accountable for their 
actions. Their leader, the man who in-
cited them, must be held accountable 
as well.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S743 
February 13, 2021 
It is important to understand that 
Donald Trump’s actions on January 6 
weren’t without precedent. The House 
impeachment managers made a com-
pelling case that Donald Trump has a 
long history of urging and supporting 
violence among his supporters, know-
ing full well that they would take ac-
tion. 
This is a key matter for this im-
peachment trial: Did Donald Trump’s 
words inspire violence? Were those car-
rying out the insurrection following 
his direction? The House managers 
gave several examples of Trump’s past 
practice. 
After Republican Congressman Greg 
Gianforte in 2018 pleaded guilty to as-
saulting a reporter who asked him a 
question, 
former 
President 
Trump 
praised him. ‘‘Any guy that can do a 
body slam—he’s my guy.’’ 
After a 2017 rally of White suprema-
cists and neo-Nazis turned violent in 
Charlottesville and killed a woman, 
former President Trump said there 
were ‘‘very fine people on both sides.’’ 
Last year, Trump sent a message for 
his followers to ‘‘liberate Michigan.’’ 
Weeks later, messages threatening vio-
lence were directed against Governor 
Gretchen Whitmer. And later in the 
fall, 
a 
plot 
to 
kidnap 
Governor 
Whitmer emerged, led by Trump fol-
lowers. President Trump made a call to 
action, and his followers responded. 
And during the 2020 Presidential de-
bates, when Donald Trump was asked if 
he would condemn White supremacists 
and other groups like the Proud Boys, 
a far-right group that endorses vio-
lence, he wouldn’t answer, instead say-
ing, ‘‘Proud Boys—stand back and 
stand by.’’ 
It is clear that Donald Trump’s sup-
porters, including those who partici-
pated in the insurrection on January 6, 
heeded his words and support of vio-
lence. The Proud Boys took Trump’s 
words—‘‘stand back and stand by’’— 
and made it their official motto. Riot-
ers at the Capitol told U.S. Capitol Po-
lice officers as they were threatening 
violence that they had been ‘‘invited’’ 
by President Trump. While the insur-
rection was going on, Trump sup-
porters were reading Trump’s tweets 
over a megaphone. The pattern is clear: 
Donald Trump has no qualms about 
asking his followers to commit vio-
lence. In fact, he celebrates them when 
they do. 
After the November 2020 elections, 
Donald Trump immediately set out to 
undermine the results. His lawyers and 
his supporters filed 60 lawsuits to ob-
ject to the results, as was his right 
under the law. But when those cases 
were tossed out, then-President Trump 
sought to cheat. He urged the secretary 
of state for Georgia to ‘‘find’’ enough 
votes to declare him the victor. When 
officials rebuffed his efforts to reverse 
his electoral loss, he led efforts to 
bring thousands of people to Wash-
ington to, in his words, ‘‘Stop the 
Steal.’’ 
The day he chose was January 6, the 
day Congress was meeting to certify 
the election results. Trump directed 
his followers to go to the Capitol and 
to ‘‘fight like hell.’’ As was docu-
mented 
extensively 
in 
this 
trial, 
Trump knew that this group was pre-
paring for violence when he directed 
them to walk to the Capitol. 
What we learned this week is that 
Donald Trump was also aware of the vi-
olence at the Capitol as a frenzied in-
surrection mob ransacked the Capitol 
and sought to physically harm Mem-
bers of Congress and even kill the Vice 
President. After being told that Vice 
President had been removed from the 
Senate Chamber for his safety, Trump 
tweeted to his supporters that Pence 
lacked ‘‘courage’’ to reject the elec-
toral college results. This happened 
precisely as Trump’s supporters were 
building a gallows and chanting ‘‘Hang 
Mike Pence.’’ 
Indeed, new information revealed 
during the course of this trial indicates 
that President Trump knew the state 
of violence in the Capitol. One Senator 
has stated publicly that he told Presi-
dent Trump on the phone that Vice 
President Pence had been removed 
from the Senate Chamber by his Secret 
Service detail. 
We have also heard on-the-record re-
ports that in a phone call between 
President Trump and House Minority 
Leader KEVIN
MCCARTHY
while the 
Leader’s office was under attack, then- 
President Trump apparently continued 
to support those carrying out the vio-
lent insurrection. So despite direct 
pleas from Members of Congress and 
the former President’s closest Repub-
lican confidants, Trump refused for 
hours to call off the mob or urge calm. 
As 
House 
impeachment 
manager 
JAMIE RASKIN said during the presen-
tation, ‘‘Donald Trump surrendered his 
role as commander-in-chief and became 
the inciter-in-chief of a dangerous in-
surrection.’’ 
Five people, including a U.S. Capitol 
Police Officer, lost their lives as a re-
sult of this insurrection guided by Don-
ald Trump. And nearly 140 officers from 
the Capitol Police and Washington 
Metropolitan Police Department were 
injured, some severely. 
The evidence presented this week 
shows that Donald Trump committed 
high crimes and misdemeanors and 
that he should be convicted. 
I thank the House managers for their 
hard work in making a thoroughly 
compelling, convincing, and fair case, 
and I hope we can move past this ter-
rible moment in our Nation’s history.

RESOLUTION 
61—HON-
ORING 
THE 
LIFE, 
ACHIEVE-
MENTS, AND LEGACY OF THE 
HONORABLE 
GEORGE 
PRATT 
SHULTZ 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mr. HAGERTY, Mr. INHOFE, and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 61 
Whereas, on December 13, 1920, the Honor-
able George Pratt Shultz was born in New 
York City as the only child of Margaret Len-
nox and Birl Earl Shultz; 
Whereas, upon graduating cum laude from 
Princeton University with a major in eco-
nomics and a minor in public and inter-
national affairs in 1942, Shultz joined the 
Marines and nobly served his country as a 
captain with a Marine anti-aircraft unit de-
ployed with the United States Army’s 81st 
Infantry Division to the Pacific for the bit-
terly fought Battle of Angaur in the Palau 
Islands; 
Whereas, following the war, Shultz earned 
a doctorate in industrial economics from the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology, 
where he taught in the Department of Eco-
nomics and at the Sloan School of Manage-
ment until taking leave to serve on Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Ad-
visors; 
Whereas Shultz then went on to join the 
University of Chicago as Dean of the Grad-
uate School of Business from 1962 until 1968; 
Whereas Shultz left academia to honorably 
serve our country in a number of critical 
economic positions, including as Secretary 
of Labor, the country’s first Director of a 
modernized Office of Management and Budg-
et (OMB), and Secretary of Treasury; 
Whereas, during his time at the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, Shultz co-founded the 
‘‘Library Group’’, which helped coordinate 
follow-up to the abolishment of the gold 
standard and the Bretton Woods system and 
develop what would eventually become the 
‘‘Group of Seven’’ or the ‘‘G–7’’, an impor-
tant forum that has strengthened inter-
national economic and security policy by 
regularly bringing together the world’s ad-
vanced economies to assess global trends and 
tackle pervasive and crosscutting issues; 
Whereas Shultz served as Secretary of 
State from 1982 to 1989 and was directly in-
volved in bringing Russian President Mi-
khail Gorbachev and President Reagan to-
gether through a process based upon mutual 
and verifiable trust, thereby allowing them 
to reach agreement on the Intermediate- 
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), 
which eliminated ground-launched ballistic 
and cruise missiles with ranges of between 
500 and 5,500 kilometers, and to initiate ne-
gotiations to reduce long-range strategic nu-
clear arms; 
Whereas, during his tenure as Secretary of 
State, Shultz had a strong and mutually sup-
portive relationship with the career Foreign 
Service, which he relied heavily on to ad-
vance key international initiatives and at-
tain foreign policy achievements of the 
Reagan Administration; 
Whereas Shultz recognized the need to bet-
ter prepare a new generation of diplomatic 
service officers, whether Foreign or Civil 
Service, and ensured the creation of what be-
came the George P. Shultz National Foreign 
Affairs Training Center (NFATC), thus ex-
panding short-term skills training to hun-
dreds of ever more diverse Department of 
State and Federal Government personnel; 
Whereas, upon returning to private life in 
1989, Shultz became a Distinguished Fellow 
at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, 
wrote and edited several books, and received 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along 
with more than a dozen other awards and 
prizes; 
Whereas, in his later years, Shultz passion-
ately advocated for a world without nuclear 
weapons; and 
Whereas Shultz recently called for the 
strengthening and modernization of the pro-
fessional education and training of our ca-
reer diplomats: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life, achievements, and leg-
acy of the Honorable George Pratt Shultz; 
(2) celebrates the statesmanship that con-
sistently characterized Shultz’s life; 
(3) acknowledges Shultz’s published con-
cern for rebuilding and strengthening Amer-
ican diplomacy and its home institution, the 
Department of State by creating a School of 
Diplomacy at the National Foreign Affairs 
Training Center; 
(4) 
commends 
to 
future 
generations 
Shultz’s example as a patriot and public 
servant both in war and in the pursuit of a 
more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative 
world order; 
(5) extends its deepest condolences and 
sympathy to the family of the Honorable 
George Pratt Shultz; and 
(6) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of 
this resolution to the family of the Honor-
able George Pratt Shultz.
