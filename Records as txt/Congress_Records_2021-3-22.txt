tions of the Earth, we worship You. 
Lord, 
walk

f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
Thursday, the Biden administration of-
ficials had their first person-to-person 
meeting with representatives from the 
People’s Republic of China. By diplo-
matic standards, the opening public ex-
change was tense. The belligerent 
grandstanding by PRC diplomats was, 
unfortunately, no surprise. It is what 
we have come to expect. 
As China’s military and economic 
might have grown, Beijing has found 
that the bullying tactics that people 
call their ‘‘wolf warrior’’ diplomatic 
strategy have often worked out for 
them. So I was glad the U.S. team used 
the opportunity to cut through the 
CCP’s spin and tell some plain truths 
about China’s regional bullying and 
disrespect for the rule of law, whether 
in Hong Kong or Tibet. 
I am also glad the administration has 
sent U.S. personnel to join other dip-
lomats in Beijing to protest the secret 
trial 
of 
Canadian 
citizen 
Michael 
Kovrig. 
But like I said last week, calling out 
China rhetorically is just the first step. 
An effective U.S. strategy will require 
more than just tough talk and sym-
bolism. 
The PRC poses all matter of threats 
to the United States and to the free 
world. They want to control crucial sea 
lanes in the South China Sea. They 
want to expand their capabilities to 
menace other countries’ forces, includ-
ing ours, with increasingly accurate 
long-range weapons. They want to re-
write the rules of the international 
system to suit their interests instead 
of ours and our friends. 
These are hard and real challenges. 
Facing 
them 
down 
will 
require 
strength and resolve from the United 
States and from our partners. So like I 
said last week, if the administration is 
serious about staying tough on China 
and strengthening our hand, they will 
have support among Senate Repub-
licans. 
But any such serious strategy will 
need to start with maintaining and 
building up the backbone of our hard 
power—the competitive edge of the 
U.S. military. To defend America, de-
fend America’s interests, and deter ad-
versaries, we need to sustain our mili-
tary edge. And to sustain our edge, we 
need to modernize our forces and main-
tain our capability to project power. 
Defense spending is the single most 
important policy lever available to us 
in our competition with China. The 
President’s budget submission will tell 
Beijing a lot about whether the Biden 
administration intends to back up 
tough talk with actual strength. 
Finally, whatever Congress may do 
to step up our game on China, it will be 
essential that it be bipartisan. The leg-
islative components of national secu-
rity should not swing wildly every time 
the gavels change hands.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1662 
March 22, 2021 
It is a perfect demonstration of why 
scrapping the 60-vote threshold for leg-
islation would be catastrophic. For im-
portant bills to have a stable and last-
ing impact, they need broad bipartisan 
buy-in. 
f 
NOMINATION OF MARTIN JOSEPH 
WALSH 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on a completely different matter, 
this afternoon the Senate will vote on 
the President’s nominee to head the 
Department of Labor. 
I will be voting against confirming 
Mr. Walsh. The Biden administration 
has already signaled they will ask him 
to implement a variety of policies that 
do not serve the long-term interests of 
American workers. 
Unfortunately, it appears that won’t 
just be the case at the Department of 
Labor but throughout the Democratic 
agenda. 
One of the President’s first acts in of-
fice was to kill thousands of American 
jobs, including union jobs, by canceling 
the Keystone XL Pipeline. Both, work-
ing Americans and domestic energy se-
curity, took a back seat to a leftwing 
signaling. 
We are hearing that the next few 
months might bring a so-called ‘‘infra-
structure’’ proposal that may actually 
be a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes 
and other job-killing, leftwing policies. 
Remember, 
the 
House 
Democrats 
tipped their hand last year. They pub-
lished a sprawling proposal that pre-
tended to be a highway bill but was 
really just a multithousand-page cous-
in of the Green New Deal. It would 
have 
plowed 
unbelievable 
sums 
of 
money not into the kinds of big, prac-
tical projects that Americans even 
think of as ‘‘infrastructure’’ but also 
into their obsessive focus on climate 
policies to the exclusion of everything 
else. 
Look, we know what kinds of policies 
are actually pro-job and pro-worker. 
We know what kind of agenda helps 
American workers build all-American 
prosperity up and down the income 
scale. 
We know that because, just over a 
year ago, before the pandemic, 4 years 
of Republican policies had built one of 
the most inclusive and optimistic 
economies in modern history. Wages 
were growing faster at the bottom than 
at the top. Unemployment was at his-
toric lows. American workers were a 
hot commodity and were getting com-
pensated accordingly. 
Pro-worker prosperity does not en-
tail having Big Government politicians 
or Big Labor bosses micromanage 
every aspect of the economy to suit lib-
eral fads. It means remembering what 
kind of pro-worker, pro-growth, pro-op-
portunity policies built the best job 
market in recent history right before 
this pandemic. 
Those are the ideas and the solutions 
that were unlocking more money and 
more opportunities for American work-
ers before COVID–19 took the world by 
storm. And those are the ideas and so-
lutions the American people elected 50 
Republican Senators to fight for. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

WELCOMING KAREN H. GIBSON, 
SERGEANT AT ARMS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this is a great and historic day. A few 
weeks ago, I announced that LTG 
Karen Gibson would assume the re-
sponsibility as Senate Sergeant at 
Arms, becoming only the 42nd Sergeant 
at Arms in Senate history. I am very 
pleased this afternoon to make her ap-
pointment official, with her family 
watching on—her father David, her 
mother Rebecca, her sister Kathleen, 
her brother-in-law Daniel, her nephew 
Bennett, and her cousin Aaron. 
Lieutenant General Gibson is taking 
on a really big job, and I know that her 
family could not be more proud of her. 
The Senate Sergeant at Arms was es-
tablished more than two centuries ago, 
when the U.S. Senate was still in its 
infancy. Back then, the primary duty 
of the Sergeant at Arms was essen-
tially senatorial babysitting; recal-
citrant 
Senators 
made 
finding 
a 
quorum a routine challenge. Today, the 
Sergeant at Arms is the Senate’s chief 
administrative officer and chief law en-
forcement officer. They have enormous 
responsibility of keeping the trains 
running on time while, at the same 
time, keeping everyone, everyone in 
the Capitol safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1663 
March 22, 2021 
Suffice it to say, Lieutenant General 
Gibson has a tall order, but I have 
every confidence that she will perform 
her duties at the same exemplary 
standards she set over the course of her 
three-decade military career. 
As Senior Intelligence Officer in the 
Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence, Lieutenant General Gibson 
supported U.S. national security objec-
tives in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Africa, 
Korea, the Pacific, and across the Mid-
dle East. Since January 6, she has been 
working with retired Army LTG Russel 
Honore´ on a comprehensive review of 
the Capitol’s security. 
So given her background and given 
what she has done recently, I know she 
is ready to hit the ground running. 
Lieutenant General Gibson is ready to 
go, and her responsibility to ensure a 
safe working environment for Sen-
ators, 
visitors, 
Capitol 
employees, 
staff, and reporters she will take with 
the utmost of gravity and competence. 
Joining her in the Office of Sergeant 
at Arms will be Kelly Fado, as Deputy 
Sergeant, and Jennifer Hemingway, as 
chief of staff, two trusted members of 
the Senate family. 
This is a historic day in a second 
way. This will be the first time in the 
history of the Senate that the leader-
ship of the Sergeant at Arms will be 
comprised entirely of women—another 
crack in the glass ceiling. And I cannot 
think of a better team than the one we 
have put together. 
Congratulations to all three of them 
on officially starting their new roles 
today. And I know, Madam President, 
you are proud of that as well. 
It is really a good day. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
next, another aspect of why this is a 
good day. 
Tonight, the Senate will confirm 
Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston to serve 
as Secretary of Labor. The son of Irish 
immigrants, Mayor Walsh followed his 
father’s footsteps in construction and 
joined the Laborers’ Union Local 223 at 
age 21, eventually serving as its presi-
dent before being elected mayor of Bos-
ton. 
During his testimony here in the 
Senate, Mayor Walsh said it was by 
joining a union that his parents were 
able to climb up into the middle class 
and give their son a shot at a better 
life. 
We have something in common. My 
grandfather came to the United States 
and became very involved with the 
labor movement. One day when he was 
14, it was raining. He was looking for 
shelter. It was pouring. He had almost 
nowhere to live. He walked into the 
labor temple, where he heard Eugene 
V. Debs and Will and Ariel Durant give 
the annual address at that temple es-
tablished by the A.F. of L. to teach the 
immigrants about the union move-
ment. So we have that in common. Our 
grandfathers are immigrants—one from 
Ireland, one from Eastern Europe, but 
both joined the labor movement, and it 
helped their family move up. 
The Department of Labor is in des-
perate need of a leader with Mayor 
Walsh’s perspective. For the past 4 
years under President Trump and Sec-
retary Scalia, unfortunately, sadly, the 
Labor Department has too often sided 
with corporate America, not the work-
ing people of America, which it was 
formed to help. Once the Senate con-
firms Mayor Walsh, American workers 
will finally have one of their own lead-
ing the Department of Labor, someone 
from working America who will fight 
for working America. 
I am proud to say that once Mayor 
Walsh is confirmed tonight, the Senate 
will have confirmed all 15 of President 
Biden’s Cabinet Secretaries. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, 
unusual responsibilities, a later than 
usual runoff election, an evenly divided 
Chamber, an insurrection, an impeach-
ment trial, and the passage of historic 
Federal relief, the Senate has still 
stayed on track and confirmed Presi-
dent Biden’s Cabinet faster than both 
of the last two administrations. Let me 
say that again. With everything else 
going on, the Senate has confirmed 
President Biden’s Cabinet faster than 
during both of the prior two adminis-
trations, one a Democrat and one a Re-
publican. 
Every 
single 
member 
of 
President Biden’s Cabinet has received 
a bipartisan vote in favor of confirma-
tion. I anticipate that the vote in favor 
of Mayor Walsh will stay true to form, 
completing an unblemished record of 
bipartisan confirmations to the Cabi-
net. 
It is a tribute to President Biden and 
his team that they have chosen such a 
fine Cabinet and a tribute to the Sen-
ators here that we have moved in such 
a quick fashion despite so many other 
responsibilities being placed on our 
shoulders in these early days of this 
Congress. 
Few Cabinets in history have begun 
their tenures with such daunting tasks: 
a once-in-a-century pandemic, an econ-
omy in the doldrums, global challenges 
like climate change and democratic de-
cline. Thankfully, this Senate has 
made sure President Biden’s Cabinet is 
in place and on the job as quickly as 
possible. We will continue the per-
sonnel business this week by installing 
the Deputy Director at OMB, the Sur-
geon General, the Assistant Secretary 
of Health and Human Services, and 
Deputy Secretaries at Energy and 
Treasury. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
PPP. In addition to these nominees, 
the Senate has another important mat-
ter of legislative business on the agen-
da this week: an extension of the bipar-
tisan Paycheck Protection Program, 
which is set to expire at the end of the 
month. 
Since its inception, the Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
has 
generated 
more than 7.8 million loans to keep 
America’s 
businesses 
afloat 
during 
what has been the worst economic cri-
sis in three-quarters of a century, since 
the Great Depression. With the help of 
the American Rescue Plan, our econ-
omy is finally turning the corner, but 
businesses are not out of the woods yet 
and are likely to need assistance for 
another few months as the country 
continues to recover. 
Most borrowers are currently await-
ing loan approvals at the Small Busi-
ness Administration, and many more 
are still looking to apply. Working 
with the Biden administration, we 
made important changes to the PPP 
program to expand eligibility and ac-
cess to nonprofits, to hard-hit inde-
pendent venues, and to make it easier 
for the smallest, most underserved 
businesses to get relief, particularly 
microbusinesses, sole proprietors, and 
woman-owned 
and 
minority-owned 
businesses. 
There is no reason—no reason—to let 
this program expire while there are 
still scores of applicants in line and 
billions of dollars left in the program. 
The House already passed the exten-
sion of the program by an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan vote, 415 to 3. A bipar-
tisan group of Senators, including Sen-
ators CARDIN and COLLINS, SHAHEEN, 
MARSHALL, SULLIVAN, and MURKOWSKI, 
support identical legislation here in 
the Senate. 
So we are not going to end this week 
without passing an extension. Again, 
the Senate must pass another exten-
sion of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram before the end of the week and 
make sure the Nation’s small busi-
nesses can have access to this very 
vital lifeline. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1664 
March 22, 2021 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee has really 
been in business for a few weeks now, 
and I think we have begun this session 
addressing some of the relevant issues 
that I expect such a committee to ad-
dress. 
First, of course, was the appointment 
of Attorney General Merrick Garland. I 
thank Senator GRASSLEY for his co-
operation on a bipartisan basis in 
bringing that nominee to the floor, 
where he received 70 Senate votes—bi-
partisan support for his leadership at 
the Department of Justice. We con-
tinue this week with two more of 
President Biden’s appointments to the 
Department of Justice: Lisa Monaco 
and Vanita Gupta. They will be consid-
ered by the full Judiciary Committee 
on Thursday. 
We will continue to fill vacancies in 
the administration as we are sent 
nominees and have that opportunity, 
but in addition to that, we have had 
hearings on several relevant topics and 
have another one starting tomorrow. 
Christopher Wray, Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, was 
called before the committee for an 
oversight hearing. It is the first time 
in more than a calendar year that the 
head of the FBI was actually brought 
to testify before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, a committee that has the 
traditional oversight responsibility for 
his Agency. His testimony was impor-
tant and timely. He talked about the 
Trump-inspired mob that attacked this 
Capitol and the rise of domestic ter-
rorism in the United States. He identi-
fied it as one of the major threats to 
security in our country, and we are 
considering legislation to empower him 
and others in the administration to ad-
dress this threat. 
That does not take anything away 
from our efforts to staunch any in-
spired international terrorism, but we 
have learned, unfortunately, that in 
addition to looking across the ocean 
for threats of terrorism, in America 
today, we have to look across the 
street. Unfortunately, there are domes-
tic terrorism groups. We saw them on 
parade January 6, and they are still at 
their work. They must be stopped to 
make sure that America is safe for ev-
eryone. 
That was an important hearing. We 
followed it up last week with the first 
ever Senate hearing on the Equality 
Act. The Equality Act, which has been 
passed by the House of Representa-
tives, has been sent to the Senate for 
consideration. Senator MERKLEY from 
Oregon is the lead sponsor. 
Simply put, the bill is there to end 
discrimination against people because 
of their sexual orientation and gender 
identity. I thought it was a very power-
ful hearing. Most Americans are sur-
prised to learn that although we now 
recognize marriage by people of the 
same gender, in many States, there is 
no protection against discrimination 
for those same people. It is a gross dis-
parity in justice in this country, and I 
thought our witnesses brought that 
point through very clearly. I hope that 
we can gather bipartisan support for 
that measure quickly and bring it to 
the floor. It is long overdue. 
Tomorrow we are having a hearing 
which is, unfortunately, very timely. I 
announced last week that this hearing 
on commonsense steps to reduce gun 
violence in America would be held this 
week. On the same day I announced 
that hearing, a gunman murdered eight 
people in a string of shootings near At-
lanta, GA—one man, seven women, and 
six of the victims were Asian Ameri-
cans. He committed these murders 
with a gun he had bought the same 
day. That day, children lost their par-
ents, husbands lost their wives, and 
fear of trauma reverberated across 
America in the Asian-American com-
munity. 
I know that the Presiding Officer and 
I reached out to people in our home 
State of Illinois to assure them that we 
are aware of this and are going to do 
everything we can to stop this type of 
discrimination and this terrible vio-
lence that followed. 
According to the Gun Violence Ar-
chive, there have been 27 mass shoot-
ings in America this month—27 mass 
shootings this month—with a mass 
shooting defined as an incident where 
at least 4 victims are shot. Mass shoot-
ings, of course, make the biggest head-
lines, but day after day, week after 
week, the deadly toll of gun violence 
grows. Last weekend, 20 people were 
shot in our city of Chicago, 4 of them 
fatally. Across the Nation, every day, 
we lose on average 109 American lives 
to gunfire—suicide, domestic violence 
shootings, accidental shootings, and 
homicides—and another 200 Americans 
are injured by guns each day. 
The numbers are sobering, and that 
is why tomorrow the Senate Judiciary 
Committee is going to address this 
issue. The subcommittee chairman, 
DICK
BLUMENTHAL
from Connecticut, 
will take over the full committee hear-
ing after I make some opening re-
marks. I know he has a special feeling 
for this issue because of the tragedy in 
Newtown, CT, just a few years ago 
when a gunman went in and killed so 
many innocent children and their 
teachers at a grade school. It was one 
horrible event. It was an event that 
was so horrible, many of us said: That 
can make the difference. Politically, 
that is going to change America. It is 
going to result in things happening fi-
nally—commonsense, 
constitutional 
gun safety measures that will keep 
guns out of the hands of people who 
would misuse them. 
Well, I would have lost that bet. 
Many others would have, too, because 
we failed to respond in a timely fash-
ion. What stopped us from passing a 
bill in the U.S. Senate for background 
checks to make sure that convicted fel-
ons did not purchase guns legally in 
America and would be stopped because 
of roadblocks we put in their paths and 
that people who were mentally unsta-
ble would not have access to guns 
which they could use to hurt innocent 
people, as we have seen over and over 
again—what stopped that from hap-
pening? A rule in the U.S. Senate. It is 
called the filibuster, and what it says 
is, it takes more than a majority for 
the overwhelming majority of the 
American people to see gun safety in 
America. It takes 60 votes in a Senate 
evenly divided 50–50. 
Well, we are hoping—we are just hop-
ing—that maybe there is a sentiment, 
a bipartisan sentiment, that could 
reach 60 votes on thoughtful, common-
sense gun control that will really say 
to people: Yes, you have your Second 
Amendment right to own a gun legally, 
responsibly, and to store it safely. You 
can use it for sporting, target practice, 
and self-defense if you wish. But we 
want to make certain that we elimi-
nate as much as possible those who 
would misuse those firearms. 
It is interesting. The overwhelming 
majority of firearm owners across the 
Nation believe that same thing. They 
don’t argue with the premise that they 
want guns to be in the hands of people 
who will use them responsibly. Yet, de-
spite this overwhelming majority sen-
timent, we can’t get the bill through 
the U.S. Senate for the very reason I 
mentioned, the filibuster. 
So when Senator MCCONNELL comes 
to the floor each day to defend the fili-
buster, the basic question you have to 
ask him is, If the Senate can work with 
the filibuster, show us. Show us. Show 
us that if we bring 45 or 50 votes to the 
floor, there are 10 Republicans who will 
join us and work with us to pass impor-
tant legislation. That wouldn’t be the 
only thing. There would be many other 
things. 
I have heard speeches on the floor by 
so many Republicans about the situa-
tion on our southern border with immi-
gration, and it truly is a challenge. I 
work on it because it is the matter 
that I have paid a lot of attention to in 
my career but also because it is subject 
matter in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Why is it that we have not addressed 
immigration reform in the United 
States? The filibuster, that is the rea-
son. The filibuster has stopped us from 
passing measures like the Dream Act. 
I introduced the Dream Act 20 years 
ago to say, if you are brought here to 
the United States as a child, raised in 
this country, you ought to have a path 
to legalization and citizenship so you 
can stay in the country you call 
home—a simple premise overwhelm-
ingly supported by the American peo-
ple. 
Five times I brought the Dream Act 
to the floor of the Senate for passage: 
Let’s make this a law. Five times it 
failed. Why? The filibuster rule. Each 
time I had a majority but not the nec-
essary 60 votes. That is another exam-
ple of where the filibuster has stepped 
in and stopped a majority of the Senate 
from passing a measure which was

timely, I believe thoughtful, and which 
the American people overwhelmingly 
supported. 
So I would say to the defenders of the 
filibuster: Show us it can work. We 
have had so little legislative activity 
that was subject to this filibuster rule 
over the last several years, and, obvi-
ously, some Senators are very content 
with that. I am not. There is work to 
be done, not just in the areas I have 
mentioned but in so many others. In-
frastructure programs for Americans 
are a good example too. 
Let’s get to work in the Senate and 
do what we were elected to do: to delib-
erate, to legislate, to amend, to express 
different points of view but, ulti-
mately, to enact laws that will make 
this a better nation. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Madam President, I want to salute a 
member of my staff before I make this 
statement. His name is Chris Homan. 
He has been with me a number of 
years. He has a special passion for peo-
ple who are languishing in prisons 
around the world for so-called political 
crimes, and he has convinced me to 
make this my cause as well. 
Time after time, we have been suc-
cessful at seeing the release of these 
political prisoners simply by speaking 
on the floor and addressing the Embas-
sies of the countries where they are im-
prisoned and trying to put some polit-
ical pressure on the leaders of those 
countries to release those prisoners. 
You wouldn’t believe that would work, 
would you, in an authoritarian regime, 
but it turns out it does, and over the 
years, we have been successful in help-
ing many political prisoners be re-
leased. Today, I would like to address 
that topic again. 
There are political prisoners lan-
guishing in jails around the world for 
nothing more than advocating for 
human rights and political freedom. 
These brave souls are often led to be-
lieve their efforts to push for freedoms 
are forgotten. I come to the floor today 
to tell them that is not the case. 
Let me start with a particularly 
cruel and troubling set of cases: a 
Saudi writer, Raif Badawi, and his law-
yer, Waleed Abulkhair. Badawi was ar-
rested in 2012 for his peaceful writings, 
charged with apostasy, sentenced to 10 
years in prison in 2012 and 1,000 lashes, 
at least 50 of which were carried out 
despite international uproar. Badawi 
suffers poor health, hypertension. His 
condition has worsened during 10 years 
in prison. 
I had the honor of meeting his wife, 
Ensaf Haidar, here in Washington, DC, 
some years ago. She is living in exile in 
Canada with her young children after 
facing threats to her life in Saudi Ara-
bia. 
Badawi’s lawyer, Waleed Abulkhair, 
a leading human rights activist, also 
was arrested in 2014 and sentenced to 10 
years in prison and a 15-year travel 
ban. 
As these two men near the latter 
years of their sentences, I once again 
appeal to the Government of the 
Saudis to free them. They have suf-
fered enough. 
I also call for the release of Filipina 
Senator Leila de Lima, who just spent 
her fourth year languishing in jail in 
the Philippines. This is a photo of her 
in her cell. 
As a leading human rights advocate, 
she has criticized the actions of the 
President of her country, Rodrigo 
Duterte. From time to time, she writes 
from her cell. Let me share a short ex-
cerpt from this brave woman who, in-
credibly, after 4 years in confinement, 
still maintains her sense of humor. She 
wrote: 
Warm greetings from my detention quar-
ters at the Philippine National Police Custo-
dial Center, Camp Crame! . . . I do not know 
how long I will remain behind bars but there 
is one thing that I am sure of—my will to 
fight for what is right continues to be 
undeterred. 
She is not alone. Many of us have 
spoken about Duterte’s political har-
assment of Filipino journalist Maria 
Ressa, who received her 9th arrest war-
rant in November and 10th in January. 
I have met with many in the Filipino 
American community in Illinois. We 
have a great, great community of Fili-
pinos in the Chicagoland area and 
across the State. I know that they and 
colleagues here, like Senators MARKEY 
and LEAHY, will continue to support ef-
forts to see a more accountable and 
democratic Philippines. 
Lastly, let me turn to the United 
Arab Emirates, where one of the Na-
tion’s top human rights defenders, 
Ahmed Mansoor, also just passed his 
fourth year in jail. You see, Mansoor 
was arrested under the guise that his 
social 
media 
post 
advocating 
for 
human rights threatened the social 
harmony of the UAE. He is considered 
to be one of the last human rights de-
fenders in the Emirates, one who 
peacefully advocates for freedom of ex-
pression, fair trials, and the humane 
treatment of prisoners. 
Since his troubling sentencing in 
2017, he has endured solitary confine-
ment and cruel separation from his 
family. Despite the dismal conditions 
of his incarceration, he remains stead-
fast in his commitment to human 
rights, even conducting multiple hun-
ger strikes in protest of jail condi-
tions—the same conditions he spoke 
against before his detention. It is long 
overdue that Emiratis let this man go. 
America’s strength around the world 
comes not only from its military and 
its economy but also from the power of 
its ideals. I can tell you from the many 
former prisoners who have come to 
visit me over the years that the sup-
port of this body and this Congress and 
the American people, which we may 
just take for granted as another speech 
on the floor of the Senate, can make a 
difference. They have come to learn 
that someone actually mentioned their 
name on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 
Washington, DC. It sustains them. It 
encourages them. It gives them hope, 
and it puts pressure on the govern-
ments that jail them to justify and ra-
tionalize the cruel treatment that they 
are responsible for. 
So let me remind Raif Badawi, 
Waleed Abulkhair, Senator Leila de 
Lima, 
Maria 
Ressa, 
and 
Ahmed 
Mansoor: You are not forgotten. We 
will continue to advocate for your free-
dom, and we hope that it comes some-
day soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARTIN JOSEPH WALSH 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this 
pandemic has made it clearer than 
ever: It is not corporations that drive 
our economy; it is American workers. 
With Marty Walsh, for whom we will 
vote in a moment on confirmation for 
the Department of Labor, workers will 
finally have someone on their side, as 
the Department that is supposed to 
look out for them. The Department of 
Labor is supposed to be the voice for 
workers in our government. It is their 
job to make sure workers’ rights are 
protected, that people are safe on the 
job, that everyone can organize a union 
and get the overtime pay they have 
earned. 
For 4 years, we have had a Depart-
ment of Labor full of corporate law-
yers. In fact, the Secretary of Labor 
was a corporate lawyer who made mil-
lions of dollars in court attacking 
labor unions and getting very well paid 
for it. That Department was full of peo-
ple who made their careers fighting for 
corporate boards and CEOs, trying to 
squeeze every last penny out of work-
ers and skirting labor laws. 
And we saw the results. The DOL 
stopped fighting to raise the overtime 
pay threshold. In my State, tens of 
thousands of workers and, nationally, 
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of 
workers failed to get a raise as a re-
sult. 
A year into the pandemic, the Occu-
pational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration, OSHA, still has not issued an 
emergency temporary standard to pro-
tect workers from coronavirus. When 
1,300 workers last year got sick at a 
Smithfield meatpacking plant, they 
fined the company a pathetic $10 per 
worker. 
With Marty Walsh, that corporate in-
filtration of the Department of Labor 
ends now. Mayor Walsh will put the 
focus back where it should be: fighting 
for the people who make this country 
work. 
We know that for far too many 
Americans, hard work doesn’t pay off. 
They have seen corporate profits go up. 
They have seen executive compensa-
tion skyrocket. They have become

more productive in the workplace, and 
yet their wages are flat. 
Hard work has never paid off for 
many Americans like it should. That is 
why voters sent a clear message in last 
year’s election: They are tired of cor-
porations running our economy. 
Corporations have had their chance. 
They failed. If corporations won’t de-
liver for their workers and create an 
economy where everyone’s hard work 
pays off, with a middle class that is 
growing instead of shrinking, then we 
have to step in and fight for workers. 
That is what Marty Walsh will do as 
the Secretary of Labor. He can work 
with OSHA to finally issue the emer-
gency temporary standard, forcing cor-
porations to take critical steps to pro-
tect their workers on the job. He can 
crack down on corporations that use 
subcontracting and independent con-
tractors and other tricks to pay work-
ers less and to deny them benefits. 
He can get to work on a new over-
time rule so that hundreds of thou-
sands more workers will finally get the 
overtime pay that they have earned. 
He can defend workers’ rights to orga-
nize to give them power in their work-
place and crack down on corporate 
union busting. 
And, as we know, Marty Walsh has 
the deep experience in the labor move-
ment to get this done. Too many peo-
ple in this town don’t understand what 
it is like not to have a voice on the job, 
to have no power over your schedule, 
to work hard at a job that doesn’t even 
pay the bills. They don’t understand 
collective bargaining and the power 
that a union card gives you over your 
career and your finances and your fu-
ture. 
Marty Walsh does understand that. 
At the age of 21, he joined the Labor-
ers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. 
He knows what a union means to work-
ers. He knows what workers are up 
against when they organize. 
Like President Biden, he is not afraid 
to talk about the labor movement, and 
he doesn’t recoil from using the word 
‘‘union.’’ He is not afraid to take on 
corporations that exploit their work-
ers. 
We already see that change in action. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS
have joined Senator BOOKER 
and me and so many of us in standing 
in solidarity with Amazon workers or-
ganizing in Alabama. 
Ultimately, it comes back to the dig-
nity of work, the idea that hard work 
should pay off for everyone, no matter 
who you are, where you live, or what 
kind of work you do. Mayor Walsh un-
derstands that when work has dignity, 
people have power over their lives and 
their schedules—and they are paid a 
living wage. When work has dignity, 
everyone can afford healthcare and 
housing and childcare. They can save 
for retirement. They can take time off 
to care for their loved ones. 
Mayor Walsh has lived those values. 
He successfully helped push his State 
to raise the minimum wage to $15. He 
cracked down on wage theft. He fought 
for paid family leave. 
He knows how important it is for the 
people in the room making decisions to 
actually reflect the diverse workers 
who make our country successful. It is 
the job of the labor movement. It is the 
job of DOL to fight for all workers. 
As we work to build back better with 
a big investment in American infra-
structure, Mayor Walsh understands 
all of the opportunities for workers 
that come with that. He comes from 
the building trades. He understands 
that we can put hundreds of thousands 
of tradespeople to work building houses 
and schools and public transit, retro-
fitting homes and offices and schools. 
We have a tremendous opportunity to 
rebuild our economy with workers—not 
corporations but with workers—at the 
center. 
If you love this country, you fight for 
the people who make it work. As Sec-
retary of Labor, that is what Marty 
Walsh will do. I urge my colleagues to 
support him. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

FALSE CLAIMS ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. A Civil War legisla-
tion called the False Claims Act has 
been on the books since that period of 
time. In 1986, I believe it was, I got 
some amendments to it that made it a 
much more valuable piece of legisla-
tion than it was before that time. 
It is called the False Claims Act, and 
it has brought, I think, something like 
$64 billion back into the Federal Treas-
ury of fraudulently taken money since 
then. 
The problem today, even though it 
has been a successful law, is that the 
courts tend, from time to time, to neu-
ter its capabilities by interpreting it in 
a way so it is not quite as effective. 
From time to time, we have passed leg-
islation to overcome some of those 
court decisions. 
I am here today to talk about an-
other opportunity this Senate has to 
make the False Claims Act the effec-
tive piece of legislation it was. 
So I want to alert my colleagues 
about the most recent limitations the 
courts have imposed on the False 
Claims Act. 
The False Claims Act was signed into 
law by President Abraham Lincoln in 
1863, for the very same purpose it 
serves today: to fight fraud, not just 
with military matters, as was the rea-
son for doing it because the Union 
Army was being defrauded at that par-
ticular time, but, today, it fights fraud 
governmentwide. 
Today, it is the government’s most 
powerful anti-fraud statute. That is be-
cause amendments that I offered in 
1986 empowered whistleblowers to sue 
fraudsters on the government’s behalf 
with or without the government’s help. 
Since then, we have recovered more 
than $64 billion of taxpayer money lost 
to fraud. 
Now, when we talk about anti-fraud 
statutes like the False Claims Act, we 
use the term ‘‘materiality.’’ It is be-
cause of that term that the courts have 
caused—their interpretation of that 
term has caused—the act to be less ef-
fective. The False Claims Act defines 
‘‘materiality’’ as ‘‘having a natural 
tendency of influencing the payment or 
receipt of money or property.’’ Basi-
cally, if the government could have 
withheld payment, then it was likely 
material. 
However, based on a 2016 Supreme 
Court opinion, the Federal courts are 
trying to reshape the act’s materiality 
requirement. In the Supreme Court’s 
opinion in Escobar, ‘‘if the Government 
pays a particular claim in full despite 
its actual knowledge that certain re-
quirements were violated, that is very 
strong evidence that those require-
ments are not material.’’ 
Citing this language, other courts 
have made the government’s payment 
decisions in these cases a deciding fac-
tor. Consequently, the Justice Depart-
ment now shies away from prosecuting 
these cases. That is the case even when 
the fraud is very obvious and then, ob-
viously, material. 
Recently, the Office of the Special 
Inspector General for Afghan Recon-
struction briefed me on a report about 
a botched Defense Department effort to 
quickly buy cargo planes from an 
Italian manufacturer called Alenia. 
In 2009, the Department of Defense 
bought 20 cargo planes from this com-
pany, Alenia, for $549 million. These 
planes were intended to move goods 
and train Afghan pilots. This is the 
type of plane we are talking about. The 
contract required the manufacturers to 
refurbish 20 retired aircraft and provide 
enough spare parts for 10 years of 
maintenance. To seal the deal, the 
company even took Department of De-
fense personnel on several warehouse 
tours to prove they had all these spare 
parts. 
When the planes arrived in Afghani-
stan, mechanics quickly noted the 
planes were very poorly refurbished. 
Worse, they couldn’t actually fly. The 
poor state of the planes and the haz-
ards of the Afghan elements made that 
impossible. The company, Alenia, also 
lied about their maintenance commit-
ments. 
Now, remember, I already told you 
about their promise that those ware-
houses were full of parts for the next 10 
years. These spare parts that they

March 22, 2021 
showed them were not for these planes. 
In other words, they were for the wrong 
planes. 
Despite this blatant fraud, the De-
partment of Defense inspectors kept 
certifying the planes, and the govern-
ment kept making payments. 
But here is the catch: The inspectors 
later admitted that many of the docu-
ments and manuals they reviewed were 
in Italian, and none of them spoke 
Italian. 
In the final count, out of 20 aircraft, 
4 never even made it to Afghanistan. 
It is unclear why the Department of 
Defense continued making payments 
despite these flagrant violations, but 
by 2013, it became clear that con-
tinuing this program was unfeasible, 
and the government tried to sell the re-
maining 16 planes. You can imagine 
that nobody wanted these planes. So 
the Obama-Biden administration sold 
them all for scrap metal. You can see 
the scrap metal right here. 
To recap, the government bought 20 
airplanes for $549 million and, in less 
than 5 years, sold them for $40,257 
worth of scrap metal. The photos next 
to me show what we bought compared 
to what it was actually worth, a little 
pile of garbage. 
It is clear that the actual condition 
of the planes and the lack of parts were 
very material components of this con-
tract. See, there is that word ‘‘mate-
rial.’’ 
Now, thanks to the Department of 
Defense’s poor judgment and also the 
courts’ new standard on materiality, 
the Justice Department won’t bring 
False Claims Act charges against that 
company. 
Materiality is important to protect 
against parasitic lawsuits, but we can’t 
allow defendants to get away with 
scalping the taxpayers because some 
government bureaucrats failed to do 
their jobs. 
Government bureaucrats are highly 
segmented and often unable to make 
key decisions for their organizations. 
Now, that is not the employee’s fault. 
That is just kind of the way govern-
ment, I am sorry to say, operates. 
Also, the government typically stops 
payments only when it has fully inves-
tigated and corroborated a claim of 
fraud. 
In my many years of investigating 
the Department of Defense, it has 
taught me that a Pentagon bureaucrat 
is rarely motivated to recognize fraud. 
That is because the money doesn’t 
come out of their pocket. This example 
highlights how the courts’ narrow in-
terpretation of ‘‘materiality’’ fails to 
take into account how the government 
really works and why we need to over-
come the courts’ decision on the defini-
tion of ‘‘materiality.’’ 
When the False Claims Act was origi-
nally passed, one fraudster boasted— 
and this is a direct quote—‘‘You can 
sell anything to the government at al-
most any price if you’ve got the guts to 
ask.’’ 
Unfortunately, that was true in this 
case as well. I have already made it 
public that I am working to patch this 
hole in the taxpayer’s pocket. This ex-
ample perfectly illustrates the need for 
change. I am working on introducing 
legislation to address the issue, and I 
am in the final stages of negotiating 
and look forward to putting forward a 
very bipartisan bill in the coming 
weeks. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

IMMIGRATION 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
from El Paso to Brownsville, my home 
State shares a 1,200-mile border with 
Mexico. If you were daring enough to 
attempt to walk that entire stretch, 
you would trek through deserts, moun-
tains, big cities, small towns, and 
maybe even stick your big toe in the 
Rio Grande. You get to know folks who 
are proud of the strong bonds that our 
country has with our southern neigh-
bor, including many who have relatives 
in both countries. You would meet en-
trepreneurs whose businesses depend 
on legitimate trade and travel between 
our countries. You would talk with 
local, State, and Federal law enforce-
ment officials who go above and beyond 
the call to keep our communities safe. 
And I have no doubt that along the 
way, you could enjoy some great Tex- 
Mex, and depending on the season, you 
would find the best grapefruit you have 
ever eaten in the Rio Grande Valley. 
Our Texas-Mexico southern border is 
a beautiful, vibrant region with a rich 
sense of community that you can’t find 
in any other part of the country. I be-
lieve it is truly unique. 
Throughout my time in the Senate, I 
have had the opportunity to spend a lot 
of time in our border communities and 
work with their incredible leaders: 
mayors, county judges, sheriffs, school 
superintendents, 
NGOs—nongovern-
mental organizations—and countless 
others. 
Well, I am sure you have heard the 
song ‘‘God Bless Texas.’’ It is true, I be-
lieve, and the folks I have come to call 
friends along the border are certainly 
doing the Lord’s work. These men and 
women work around the clock to cre-
ate safe communities and thriving 
economies, something that has been es-
pecially tough during the hand they 
have been dealt this last year with the 
pandemic. But they have lived through 
a pandemic, hurricanes, droughts, a 
winter storm that presented subzero 
freezing temperatures for a week. All 
have hit my State in the last 12 
months. 
Folks in these communities, as they 
have throughout the country, have lost 
friends and loved ones. They have lost 
jobs. They have lost businesses and op-
portunities and so much more. Now 
they are trying to deal with another 
crisis, one they had no hand in creating 
and should not be responsible for man-
aging alone. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
continues to play a high-stakes version 
of the game Taboo as they try to find 
a word—any word—but ‘‘crisis’’ to refer 
to what is happening along the south-
ern border. President Biden himself has 
called it a ‘‘humanitarian challenge.’’ 
Secretary Mayorkas prefers the term 
‘‘situation.’’ And the President’s Chief 
of Staff referred to it as a ‘‘mess.’’ The 
problem here isn’t the choice of the 
word you use to describe it but the im-
plication of downplaying the serious-
ness of this migration surge. 
In an attempt to lessen the impact of 
this dramatic increase in illegal migra-
tion, the administration has revoked 
policies that were helping deter such 
an influx. It failed to rapidly provide 
the resources needed to respond to the 
crisis once it revoked the previous poli-
cies, and now the border communities 
in my State along that 1,200-mile com-
mon border with Mexico are expected 
to pick up the slack. 
Regardless of how you want to brand 
what is happening, here are the facts. 
Last month, Customs and Border Pro-
tection encountered more than 100,000 
individuals 
along 
our 
border 
last 
month alone—100,000. That is the high-
est number since 2006. More than 9,000 
of these 100,000 people were children, 
unaccompanied 
children, 
separated 
when their parents sent them, along 
with human smugglers, criminal orga-
nizations, to make their dangerous 
trek from Mexico or Central America 
or somewhere else into the United 
States. Another 19,000 are what are 
euphemistically called family units, 
usually 1 parent and 1 or more chil-
dren. 
Now, we know that this journey to 
our borders isn’t safe or easy, and you 
can imagine that is especially true for 
unaccompanied children. Many arrive 
at our border in critical health, having 
endured 
days 
and 
weeks 
or 
even 
months of exposure on the road. I have 
heard horrific stories of physical and 
sexual abuse that occur in the hands of 
these criminal organizations who move 
migrants from place A to place B. But 
they are nothing more than cartels, 
human smugglers, criminals who care 
nothing about the individuals whom 
they are ferrying from their point A to 
point B. All they care about is the 
money that they make, and they make 
a lot of money. 
By law, children cannot be in the 
custody of Customs and Border Protec-
tion for more than 72 hours. Within 
that window, they are required by law 
to be transferred to the custody and 
care of the Department of Health and 
Human Services. But right now, the 
system is so overwhelmed that thou-
sands of children have been in custody 
beyond the legal limit, including hun-
dreds who have been held for more than 
10 days in border detention facilities.

tures taken inside, I believe, the Donna

detention facility showing children ba-
sically stacked end to end, trying to 
stay warm, trying to sleep because the 
Border Patrol facilities are simply 
overwhelmed. 
The situation has grown so dire, the 
administration has sent the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to 
help, and now they have set up a new 
influx care facility in Dallas and Mid-
land to provide for these children. The 
Midland facility has experienced so 
many issues that no additional mi-
grant teens are being sent there. In the 
first few days of operation, more than 
10 percent of the population housed 
there tested positive for COVID–19, and 
at least one child has been hospital-
ized. One government official described 
the process of setting up the facility as 
‘‘building a plane as it’s taking off.’’ 
There is simply no reason the admin-
istration should have been caught flat- 
footed by this surge of illegal migra-
tion. After all, the President cam-
paigned on promises of policies that 
were sure to lead to this very situa-
tion. When you remove the policies 
that deter illegal border crossings, 
what do you expect? 
We know that the spring months are 
typically the busiest for migration be-
cause mild temperatures make the 
journey a little less dangerous and 
folks want to come to the United 
States for summer work. 
We know the cartels and criminal or-
ganizations are very knowledgeable 
about our immigration laws. They 
know them perhaps better than most 
Americans do, and they know how to 
navigate them. We know a flawed court 
ruling on the Flores settlement agree-
ment means even more children will 
come across our border because now 
families are subject to the same re-
quirements as unaccompanied children. 
We know we have an immigration 
court backlog that is roughly 1.3 mil-
lion cases deep, and the average time 
for a case to be presented in court is 
now 21⁄2 years. Nevertheless, the Biden 
administration, by revoking the pre-
vious policies without having a plan to 
replace them, has created a perfect 
storm that anyone could have told 
them would end up in this situation. 
We have experienced migration surges 
in the past but never of this mag-
nitude. 
In the midst of a pandemic, Sec-
retary Mayorkas has said that we are 
on track to see the highest number of 
border crossings in 20 years and the ad-
ministration needs to take action now 
to keep things from getting any worse. 
As migrants continue to make their 
way to our southern border in record 
numbers, law enforcement, local offi-
cials, and nongovernmental organiza-
tions, notwithstanding their best ef-
forts, are not equipped to manage the 
influx, certainly not in these numbers. 
They don’t have the facilities. They 
don’t have the policies, the funding, or 
the resources to manage the crisis in a 
fair, efficient, and humane way. That 
needs to change. 
For folks who are not from a border 
State or haven’t spent much time at 
the border, it is difficult to understand 
just how complex the situation is. 
They may have learned what they 
think they know about the border from 
movies or novels, or they may have 
read news articles and assume border 
communities are dangerous or lawless 
places. That assumption could not be 
farther from the truth. But it is true 
that our border communities are being 
asked to carry more than their fair 
share of the weight during this crisis, 
when the past year has already been 
challenging enough with the pandemic. 
Like cities across the country, border 
communities have had to cover a range 
of expenses created by the pandemic, 
but unlike those other communities, 
they now have the added economic 
struggle created by limits on non-
essential border travel. 
Prepandemic, 
folks 
from 
Mexico 
could travel across the border to shop, 
to eat at restaurants, and visit family 
members. These were huge drivers of 
the economy along our entire border 
region. But the pause on legitimate, 
nonessential travel by title 42 has cre-
ated a serious economic strain on these 
communities, and leaders are strug-
gling to understand the disconnect be-
tween the Biden administration’s two 
very different approaches. 
At a recent roundtable my friend 
Congressman HENRY
CUELLAR
and I 
hosted in Laredo, someone said: I don’t 
understand how you can catch and re-
lease the migrants and not let our 
neighbors across the border come over 
and spend money in our communities 
to help bolster our economy. 
This confluence of crises is a one-two 
punch for our border communities, and 
it is unfair they are expected to carry 
the burden of this crisis. That is the 
Federal Government’s responsibility. 
This Friday, my colleague Senator 
CRUZ and I will welcome a number of 
our colleagues to the Rio Grande Val-
ley, where they can hear and see about 
these challenges firsthand. I welcome 
any Member of the Senate or the Con-
gress to join me at the border at a time 
of their choosing. I know I have bene-
fited from the feedback and advice 
from the experts on the ground who are 
dealing with this crisis firsthand, and I 
am glad to bring some of my Senate 
colleagues on Friday along for a visit 
at this critical moment. 
Hopefully that will help us to find a 
way, along with the administration in 
a bipartisan way, to reduce some of the 
pull factors that incentivize people to 
come and navigate our system. 
You are never going to deal with the 
fact that people want a better life or 
are fleeing violence. We all get that. 
We understand why, as human beings, 
people would want to leave that, but 
we also know that the cartels are get-
ting rich off of this business model, and 
certainly they are incentivized to en-
courage as many people as possible to 
come and pay their extortionate fees in 
the process. But the combination of 
those at this point—both the push fac-
tors and the pull factors, especially 
with the Biden administration putting 
a green light on our border and basi-
cally saying ‘‘All comers are welcome 
to enter the country’’—is creating an 
unreasonable expectation about what 
people are going to encounter, as well 
as overwhelming the capacity of our 
Border Patrol, Health and Human 
Services, and the Office of Refugee Re-
location to be able to deal with them. 
We know that the incentives involved 
in a catch-and-release system, in which 
people are asked to return in perhaps 
months, maybe years, for a future 
court date to consider their asylum 
claims, are nothing but an invitation 
for them to not appear and simply melt 
into the great American landscape and, 
again, continue to incentivize people to 
come because they know they can beat 
the system. They certainly can game 
the system, and, unfortunately, too 
often people beat the system, creating 
the situation we find now at the south-
ern border. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER

HIRONO). The clerk will call the roll.

NOMINATION OF MARTIN JOSEPH WALSH 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to support the nomination 
of Marty Walsh to be our Nation’s next 
Secretary of Labor. Mr. Walsh is an ex-
perienced leader who has always been a 
fighter for working families as the 
mayor of Boston, a State legislator, 
and as a union president. We need a 
Secretary of Labor who will make 
workplaces 
safer 
and 
prevent 
the 
spread of COVID–19 on the job, ensure 
that unemployed workers get the bene-
fits they need and deserve, and support 
workers exercising their rights to form 
a union and bargain collectively. 
Only 11.6 percent of workers were 
represented by a union in 2019, down 
from 27 percent in 1979. The decline in 
unionization has coincided with a 
marked divergence between overall 
productivity growth in our economy 
and paychecks for workers. While pro-
ductivity 
has 
grown 
significantly, 
hourly compensation for rank-and-file 
workers has been nearly stagnant once 
inflation is taken into account. 
In a January 22 Executive order on 
protecting 
the 
Federal 
workforce 
which faced especially harsh attacks 
from the Trump administration, Presi-
dent Biden reaffirmed that it is ‘‘the 
policy of the United States to encour-
age union organizing and collective 
bargaining.’’ Strengthening and enforc-
ing the laws that enable workers to do 
so must be at the core of our efforts to 
build an economy that works for all 
Americans, and Marty Walsh is the 
right person for the job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1669 
March 22, 2021 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, I am 
going to support the nomination of 
Mayor Marty Walsh to be the U.S. Sec-
retary of Labor. 
Now, why is a guy from North Caro-
lina here to encourage my colleagues 
to vote for the mayor of Boston, MA? 
Well, it is quite simple. Mayor Walsh 
has the background and skills and the 
awareness for the need of balance in 
conversations between labor and man-
agement. 
He has been a mayor; he has been a 
State representative; and he has also 
been a union leader. The Department of 
Labor serves an immensely important 
role in our economy and in the lives of 
the American people. Especially in the 
midst of a pandemic, with unemploy-
ment at 6.7 percent and 12.6 million 
Americans unemployed, this is a job 
that needs filling. 
But our Nation can’t have a Labor 
Secretary that will ever be accused of 
being in cahoots with labor or beholden 
to management. I have made it clear 
that the Labor Secretary’s job is to 
play a balanced role and to confront 
both, when necessary, for the protec-
tion of the rank-and-file workers. 
Mayor Walsh emphasized during his 
nomination hearing that he wanted to 
work with us collaboratively to help 
the American workers improve and ex-
pand opportunities. He respects the im-
portance of job creators and the need 
for better coordination of numerous job 
training programs. 
Mayor Walsh is committed to mak-
ing sure commerce and labor work co-
operatively. He stated that the workers 
in a representation election have the 
right to listen to both sides. Mayor 
Walsh agreed to be responsive to our 
oversight requests and to keep us up-
dated on his plans and departmental 
actions. 
Now, we won’t agree on everything, 
but we should be able to find places 
that we can agree, in a bipartisan way, 
to move forward. I support the nomina-
tion of Mayor Marty Walsh, and I look 
forward to working with him. I encour-
age my colleagues to support this nom-
ination as well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN GOODROW 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us 
have been sent here by the people of 
our States to represent them. I have al-
ways felt a true measure of the quality 
of our service is reflected in the kind of 
people we hire to help us do these awe-
some jobs. The people in our State of-
fices, on our frontlines, are critical in 
this effort. 
John Goodrow is one such public 
servant. I hired him in 1987 from his job 
at a local radio station. John brought 
his radio voice and Vermont sensi-
bility. He has a great sense of humor 
and could see the challenges, frustra-
tions, and occasional absurdities of ev-
eryday life in a Senate office. This was 
coupled with a determination to serve 
all Vermonters. 
On March 4 of this year, John 
Goodrow marked 34 years as a loyal 
and dedicated service. With deep appre-
ciation and respect and more than a 
little bit of sadness, I recently in-
formed my staff that John has decided 
to retire on March 31. 
At the age of 25, John came to my of-
fice 
scheduling 
appointments 
and 
events, and serving as my on-the- 
ground Vermont press secretary. He 
clipped news items in a time when they 
were actually cut and copied from 
newspapers, and John loved his type-
writer. It was just a few years ago that 
he reluctantly let go of the typewriter 
in his office. Staff may have even spir-
ited it away when he wasn’t there. 
He understood the importance of my 
travel throughout our State to meet 
with Vermonters, and in his bones, he 
knew it how meaningful it was for 
Marcelle and me to be home at our 
farmhouse in Middlesex. 
He fielded the scores of scheduling 
requests that came to my office. And 
later, as my deputy State director, he 
has helped in overseeing an exception-
ally skilled and dedicated staff. 
What I also treasured was how direct 
John could be with me. When some-
thing was wrong, he let me know. If I 
was reluctant to do something he 
deemed important, he made his case. In 
our jobs, we are frequently surrounded 
by people who are too quick to flatter. 
That was never a problem with John 
and something I always valued. 
John has been a valuable resource 
and coach to countless staff members 
and interns over the years. His institu-
tional memory, his good judgment and 
steadiness of purpose, and his connec-
tions to Vermonters across our State 
are unmatched. His droll sense of 
humor, including practical jokes, and 
his gifted storytelling can take you 
back many years, including back to 
every one of my campaigns. And his 
empathy and compassion for others is a 
gift. 
Marcelle and I value John’s friend-
ship, his loyalty, and his dedication to 
helping those in need. We have watched 
his family grow and prosper as he and 
Mary Ellen raised their two boys, Joe 
and Jamie. 
While we will miss his booming voice 
when we walk down the hall of the Bur-
lington office, we will take comfort in 
knowing that voice will continue to be 
heard at Centennial Field as baseball 
season begins anew. 
Marcelle and I congratulate John for 
all he has accomplished, we commend

TRIBUTE TO CORNELIA DOZIER 
COOPER 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Kentucky is home to many talented 
artists. They capture our heritage with 
color, movement, and language. Their 
creativity offers inspiration and makes 
us proud to call the Bluegrass home. 
Today, I would like to recognize my 
friend Cornelia Dozier Cooper, one of 
these gifted Kentuckians, who con-
tinues to awe our Commonwealth with 
her vision, generosity, and leadership. 
Cornelia was recently recognized by 
her hometown with a Distinguished 
Community Service Award. It is a 
privilege to join her many fans in shar-
ing my hearty congratulations. 
Cornelia moved to Pulaski County in 
Southeastern Kentucky six decades 
ago. Instantly, in her words, she ‘‘fell 
in love.’’ The breathtaking landscapes 
fill her imagination and fuel her art. 
Cornelia skillfully captures the re-
gion’s beauty and the distinct char-
acter of its people in her watercolor. 
She brings joy and appreciation to all 
those who have viewed her work. I am 
proud to count myself among them. In 
2019, 
Cornelia 
received 
the 
Milner 
Award, our Commonwealth’s highest 
artistic honor, in tribute to her mas-
tery of the brush and her devotion to 
her craft. 
Kentucky’s traditions are reflected 
in Cornelia’s artwork as well as in her 
philanthropy and service. She has 
helped found and continues to support 
numerous local organizations to foster 
artistic expression. After receiving a 
donation of books from the Carnegie 
Library, Cornelia knocked on doors 
around Somerset to gather support for 
the area’s first library. Her own endow-
ment provides grants to aspiring per-
formers and artists in the Lake Cum-
berland area. As an enthusiastic men-
tor and a compassionate friend, Cor-
nelia has singlehandedly led a new gen-
eration of budding artists to find their 
own inspiration in the hills of South-
eastern Kentucky. 
Even beyond the brush, Cornelia has 
brought beauty to her community. In 
Somerset’s 
Fountain 
Square—which 
hosts a statue of Cornelia’s brother-in- 
law, Kentucky Senator John Sherman 
Cooper—she has taken personal respon-
sibility for planting flowers and lead-
ing renovations. She is driven to make 
the square a source of collective pride. 
Cornelia’s influence on the local cre-
ative community is difficult to over-
state, and it will continue for years to 
come. 
My friend continues to create well 
into her nineties. She has lifted this 
entire community with grace and art. 
It is a privilege to once again thank 
Cornelia for sharing her talents across 
Kentucky. She has earned this award 
and our sincere praise. I encourage all 
my Senate colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Cornelia Cooper on a 
lifetime of distinction and success.

CONFIRMATION OF XAVIER 
BECERRA 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, on March 
18, I voted against the confirmation of 
Xavier Becerra to be Secretary of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services. 
Mr. 
Becerra has no substantive experience 
in public health policy, and he has 
proven himself to be an extremist on 
the few occasions he has engaged on 
health care issues. In October 2017, he 
told FOX News, ‘‘I’ve been a supporter 
of Medicare for All for the 24 years that 
I was in Congress.’’ As attorney general 
of California, he filed over 100 lawsuits 
against the Trump administration, in-
cluding leading a group of attorneys 
general in opposing Texas’s legal chal-
lenge to Obamacare in Texas v. Azar. 
He also won lawsuits to reclassify gig 
economy companies like Uber and Lyft 
as employers. In response, California’s 
Prop 22 was drafted, with a description 
saying it ‘‘changes employment classi-
fication rules for app-based transpor-
tation and delivery workers.’’ Becerra’s 
office, which has authority to summa-
rize ballot measures, seemingly tried 
to sabotage Prop 22 by changing its 
summary to say it ‘‘exempts app-based 
transportation and delivery companies 
from providing employee benefits to 
certain drivers and delivery workers.’’ 
Californians passed Prop 22 anyway, 
with over 58 percent support. 
Mr. Becerra’s history suggests he will 
use this Cabinet post for political ac-
tivism, not for advancing our Nation’s 
public health. For that reason, I op-
posed his confirmation.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE LORENE 
B. FERGUSON 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, it is 
an honor to recognize the lifetime of 
service and historic contributions of 
Navajo Nation Supreme Court Justice 
Lorene B. Ferguson, who died on March 
1, 2021, with her daughters at her bed-
side, from complications of COVID–19. 
Justice 
Ferguson 
was 
the 
first 
woman justice on the Navajo Nation 
Supreme Court. In 2001, she was nomi-
nated to serve as Associate Justice by 
President Kelsey Begaye and was con-
firmed by the Navajo Nation Council. 
She served as an Associate Justice on 
the Navajo Nation Supreme Court until 
2007, including as Acting Chief Justice 
from 2004 to 2005. 
Prior to her appointment to the Su-
preme Court, Justice Ferguson served 
as a Navajo circuit judge in the 
Kayenta District Court and as a Navajo 
Tribal Court judge in the Shiprock, 
To’hajiilee, Ramah, and Alamo Courts. 
She also served for 8 years as a staff at-
torney at the Navajo Nation Depart-
ment of Justice, where she drafted the 
first Navajo Election Code and Navajo 
scholarship policy for the Department 
of Education. 
Justice Ferguson was born in the 
Sawmill, Ni’ii Jı´’ı´h, Chapter of the 
Navajo Nation in the Fort Defiance 
Agency in Arizona. She graduated from 
Fort Lewis College in 1965. She worked 
in community development, welfare 
rights, and Native American education 
as a Head Start teacher and Indian 
education 
training 
technician. 
She 
began her legal career after graduating 
from the University of New Mexico 
School of Law in 1983. 
Justice Ferguson served as a mentor 
and role model for numerous Navajo 
attorneys and law clerks. She was a 
strong advocate for education and 
Tribal traditional law. She served as a 
judicial education faculty member for 
the National Judicial College at the 
University of Nevada in Reno and was 
the first Tribal judge to serve as a 
judge in residence at the University of 
Tulsa School of Law. She frequently 
spoke at law schools around the coun-
try to educate students and faculty on 
the importance of Tribal law. 
Justice Ferguson was also a loving 
wife, mother, grandmother, and matri-
arch for her family. My thoughts are 
with all of her loved ones and all those 
who were touched by her life during 
this time of loss.

TRIBUTE TO DR. DAN ALPERT 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, it is 
an honor to recognize over two decades 
of dedication and service to New Mex-
ico from Dr. Dan Alpert, my senior leg-
islative assistant, who is retiring after 
a distinguished career in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
A 
dedicated 
public 
servant, 
Dr. 
Alpert began his career as a nuclear en-
gineer at Sandia National Laboratories 
in Albuquerque, NM, working on nu-
clear power, renewable energy, and en-
ergy efficiency programs for 20 years. 
In 1997, Dr. Alpert took his extensive 
experience at Sandia to Capitol Hill for 
a 1-year fellowship sponsored by the 
American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, AAAS, in the office of 
my predecessor, Senator Jeff Binga-
man. Since then, Dr. Alpert has served 
the people of New Mexico in the U.S. 
Senate for more than two decades. 
Dr. Alpert’s dedication to New Mex-
ico and expertise has been instru-
mental in steering my legislative pri-
orities on the Senate Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee. Dr. Alpert’s 
distinguished career includes leader-
ship in energy storage research and de-
velopment, cutting-edge energy trans-
mission planning, and careful oversight 
and stewardship of our Nation’s nu-
clear laboratories and the Waste Isola-
tion Pilot Plant. While he probably did 
not plan on it when he was earning his 
nuclear engineering Ph.D., Dr. Alpert 
also served as a longtime and well-re-
spected agriculture and infrastructure 
expert in Senator Bingaman’s office. 
Anyone who has ever worked with 
Dr. Alpert also knows that his policy

expertise is matched by his dedication 
to his colleagues and to mentoring the 
next generation of public servants. Dr. 
Alpert has demonstrated his heart of 
gold, a natural kindness, and wonderful 
sense of humor to all who have had the 
pleasure to meet him. I also recognize 
that Dr. Alpert could not be where he 
is today without the love and support 
of his sweetheart, Ann. 
On behalf of the people of the State 
of New Mexico and on behalf of my en-
tire staff and Senator Bingaman’s 
staff, I thank him for his service. I 
know I speak for so many when I thank 
Dr. Alpert for his contributions to New 
Mexico and to our Nation. I know that 
he will continue to make a difference 
in the lives of everyone he meets. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the dedicated service of Dr. 
Alpert and congratulate him on his re-
tirement from the U.S. Senate.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. KAREN 
TRUJILLO 
∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, the 
tragic passing of Dr. Karen Trujillo, a 
devoted mother and compassionate 
leader who dedicated her life to New 
Mexico’s students and teachers, is a 
tremendous loss for the entire State of 
New Mexico. 
Like so many in New Mexico, I will 
be forever grateful for the opportuni-
ties I had to spend time with Dr. Tru-
jillo and learn from her. She was a tire-
less advocate for education whose en-
thusiasm for learning was truly infec-
tious. I am especially appreciative for 
how much she advocated for all stu-
dents to have access to outstanding 
education in science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics. 
Dr. Trujillo served for more than 25 
years as an educator. She began her ca-
reer in the classroom as a math teach-
er at Las Cruces High School and went 
on to teach at Cobre High School in 
Bayard, Hot Springs High School in 
Truth or Consequences, and at Alma 
d’Arte Charter High School in Las 
Cruces. She also served in many edu-
cation leadership roles, including prin-
cipal at Las Cruces Catholic School, 
associate dean of research at New Mex-
ico State University’s School of Edu-
cation, New Mexico secretary of public 
education, and superintendent of Las 
Cruces Public Schools. 
Dr. Trujillo’s legacy will be felt for 
years not only in all the students she 
inspired but in classrooms across our 
State led by educators whom she 
mentored and led. At NMSU, she di-
rected K–12 outreach for the Alliance 
for the Advancement of Teaching and 
Learning and started the Southwest 
Outreach Academic Research Lab and 
Educators Rising NM, an organization 
that recruits high school students for 
careers in teaching. 
Dr. Trujillo was proud of her deep 
New Mexico roots and her close-knit 
family. After early years growing up in 
Santa Fe, she and her family resettled 
in Las Cruces, where she graduated 
from Mayfield High School and re-
ceived her bachelor’s, master’s, and 
doctorate degrees from New Mexico 
State University. Her father Gilbert 
set a positive example of public service 
for her as a longtime Don˜ a Ana County 
commissioner. 
Even while she took on leadership 
roles throughout the State, Karen 
could often be found with her family at 
the Hatch Valley High School gym-
nasium, where her husband Ben is the 
athletic director, her older daughter is 
a basketball coach, and her younger 
daughter played for the team. She 
often took on duties as the basketball 
announcer. 
I 
am 
keeping 
Ben, 
their 
kids, 
Taralyn, Tim and Tavyn, the Trujillo 
and Apodaca families, as well as all of 
the New Mexicans who are grieving 
this devastating loss, in my thoughts.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
TESTER, Mrs. CAPITO, and Ms. 
BALDWIN): 
S. 883. A bill to modify the Federal 
TRIO programs; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, helping 
students achieve their education and 
career goals has long been a priority 
for me. I come to the floor today to in-
troduce two bipartisan bills. Both are 
aimed at helping students pursue high-
er education, complete their degrees, 
and have satisfying work lives. 
Prior to my election to the Senate, I 
worked at Husson University in Ban-
gor, ME. Many of Husson’s students, 
for the most part, are first-generation 
college students. They are the first in 
their families to take that step of pur-
suing higher education. 
I saw firsthand the importance of 
several Federal initiatives: Pell grants, 
work study, and TRIO—programs that 
are specifically aimed at students 
whose families have little or no experi-
ence at all with higher education. 
The first bill that I am introducing 
today is the Educational Opportunity 
and Success Act. It would reauthorize 
and strengthen the Federal TRIO Pro-
grams. 
I have been a longtime champion of 
TRIO. It helps students prepare for, 
succeed in, and graduate from college 
or other institutions of higher learn-
ing. I would like to thank Senators 
TESTER, CAPITO, and BALDWIN for join-
ing me as original cosponsors. 
Congress created the TRIO Programs 
because it recognized that low-income, 
first-generation college students often 
face significant obstacles to accessing 
and completing higher education. Our 
bipartisan bill would reauthorize these 
programs, 
modestly 
increase 
grant 
sizes, and make it easier for adminis-
trators to reach students who would 
benefit from TRIO. 
The bill also updates the way that 
the 
programs 
are 
evaluated 
and 
streamlines the application process. 
The bill would also increase the small 
stipend for Upward Bound students. 
Upward Bound is one of the TRIO Pro-
grams. These stipends make their col-
lege visits more accessible. These visits 
are often the first time that these 
young people have experienced a col-
lege campus. And it would create a new 
stipend for veterans participating in 
the Veterans Upward Bound Program. 
The Educational Opportunity and 
Success Act would also institute a 
commonsense process for correcting 
TRIO applications that have minor er-
rors. 
Now, let me give you a concrete ex-
ample. In 2017, the Department of Edu-
cation initially rejected dozens of Up-
ward Bound applications based on arbi-
trary, nonsubstantive formatting cri-
teria, such as line spacing or font size 
irregularities. The Department lost 
sight of the goal of serving students 
and instead focused on whether the for-
matting criteria were followed exactly 
correctly. 
One of these applications was from 
the University of Maine at Presque 
Isle. It had used 11⁄2 spacing instead of 
double spacing in text appearing in 
graphics in just two of the applica-
tion’s 65 pages. 
Imagine that the application was not 
considered on its merits at all because 
of a spacing error that accompanied 
graphics on 2 pages of a 65-page appli-
cation. The Department’s bureaucratic 
decision would have denied 960 dis-
advantaged Maine high school students 
from the chance of fulfilling their aca-
demic potential. 
After many months of advocacy, I 
worked with the Department of Edu-
cation. I kept pressing the Department. 
And I worked with my Appropriations 
colleagues to reverse this ill-conceived 
policy. But it took Federal legislation 
to move the Department from its bu-
reaucratic decision, which affected po-
tentially 
960 
students 
in 
northern 
Maine. It affected students that were 
in other high schools as well across 
this country. I remember Montana was 
one of those that was affected. 
The University of Maine at Presque 
Isle ultimately received its TRIO grant 
to serve those students. The bill that 
we are introducing today would pre-
vent the Department of Education 
from rejecting applications simply on 
the basis of formatting criteria. This is 
a commonsense reform that will pre-
vent unnecessary bureaucratic obsta-
cles in the future. We should be making 
sure that Federal funds get out the 
door efficiently and focus on the stu-
dents they are meant to serve. 
I have met so many Maine TRIO stu-
dents and have loved learning about 
their dreams for the future. One of 
them 
is 
a 
priest 
who 
serves 
in 
Skowhegan, ME. Neither of his parents 
went beyond the eighth grade. He, 
through the encouragement of the Up-
ward Bound Program, went to Dart-
mouth and then on to the seminary and 
is now a priest. 
Let me tell you about another out-
standing individual, Jason Judd. Jason 
grew up in Athens, ME, a very small 
community. Jason said: I knew that 
education was the only way I could es-
cape poverty. Upward Bound taught me 
how to be successful in education and 
encouraged me to pursue my passions. 
Jason is a first-generation college 
graduate. With the support of Upward 
Bound, he went to the University of 
Maine at Farmington and earned his 
bachelor’s degree. He chose to go into 
school administration. He received his 
master’s degree from the University of 
Southern Maine in educational leader-
ship and earned his doctorate from 
Northeastern University in organiza-
tional leadership studies. 
Now, Jason is the executive director 
of Educate Maine, where he works to 
improve education in our State. TRIO 
put him on the path to success. And 
now Jason supports students just like

himself across the State of Maine, a 
real success story that TRIO helped 
make possible. 
The TRIO Programs have changed 
the lives of first-generation students 
across Maine and the country, opening 
the doors to the opportunities provided 
by higher education. I would ask all of 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation to extend and improve 
the TRIO Programs. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. 
HASSAN, Mr. CORNYN, and Ms. 
SMITH): 
S. 885. A bill to establish a rural post-
secondary and economic development 
grant program; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the sec-
ond bill I am introducing today is the 
Success for Rural Students and Com-
munities Act. This bill would help stu-
dents living in rural areas achieve 
their higher education goals and con-
nect them with economic opportunities 
in their communities. I want to thank 
Senators HASSAN, CORNYN, and SMITH 
for introducing this legislation with 
me. 
According to census data, two out of 
three Maine schools are in rural com-
munities, and more than half of Maine 
students attend these schools. Ninety 
percent of Maine’s students graduate 
from high school. That is great. But 
only 62 percent enroll in some kind of 
higher education right away. Unfortu-
nately, an even lower percentage of 
Maine students go on to actually earn 
a degree or a credential. That often 
leaves them with student debts but 
without the credential or degree that 
they need. 
Maine’s experience is not unique. 
Rural students tend to graduate from 
high school at higher rates than their 
peers in urban districts and at about 
the same rate as their suburban peers, 
but fewer rural graduates enroll in col-
lege upon graduation than their urban 
and suburban counterparts. Our bill 
would authorize $60 million for dem-
onstration grants to create community 
partnerships that help rural students 
access college and career pathways. 
Community stakeholders, such as 
local school districts, colleges, univer-
sities, regional economic development 
entities and community organizations, 
would join together to help students 
and their families navigate higher edu-
cation opportunities and address bar-
riers that too often stand in the way to 
their achievement. 
For 
example, 
partnerships 
could 
work together to expose students to 
college campuses, courses, programs, 
and internships. They could focus on 
enrollment and completion rates of 
rural, nontraditional students, who 
may find that they need additional cre-
dentials or who once began but did not 
finish postsecondary education. 
Today, as you well know, many of 
the employers require something more 
than a high school diploma—perhaps a 
college degree, a skilled trade creden-
tial, or a professional certificate. Our 
bill would encourage schools and local 
employers to work together to put stu-
dents on pathways into the high-de-
mand jobs available where they want 
to live. Several strategies could be de-
veloped and tested, including work- 
based learning opportunities like ap-
prenticeships, internships, and a se-
quence of courses on the path to a cer-
tain skill or job. 
In northern Maine, the Aroostook 
Aspirations Initiative is using this 
model successfully to help put students 
on pathways to academic and career 
success. The initiative collaborates 
with local businesses and with colleges 
and universities to offer seminars that 
guide students throughout their edu-
cation. Students can team up with em-
ployers in the area through internships 
that give them the experience and the 
careers they wish to pursue. 
Last year, I met, from Aroostook 
County, a student named Katelyn 
Amero, who came to Washington to 
talk about her career goals. Katelyn 
hopes to pursue a career in medicine. 
In 2019, Katelyn participated in the 
Emerging Rural Leaders program at 
the University of Chicago, which pro-
vides 
opportunities 
for 
rural 
high 
school students to enroll in college 
courses over the summer months. That 
program has helped put her on the path 
to becoming a physician. 
The Success for Rural Students and 
Communities Act would support dy-
namic programs such as the Emerging 
Rural Leaders program and the Aroos-
took Aspirations Initiative. It would 
encourage other communities to inno-
vate in similar ways. 
Both bills I am introducing today 
would provide critical support for stu-
dents across the country who are seek-
ing to achieve their college and career 
dreams. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port both of these bills. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 886. A bill to establish a National 
Child Abuse Hotline; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleague from Ari-
zona, Senator SINEMA, in introducing 
legislation to support the ongoing op-
eration of the national child abuse hot-
line, which is currently operated by 
Childhelp, a national non-profit. Of all 
the major national help hotlines, the 
crisis line for child abuse and neglect is 
the only one without a Federal author-
ization and dedicated funding. Our bill, 
the National Child Abuse Help Hotline 
Act of 2021, would give the Administra-
tion for Children and Families the au-
thority to award funding to increase 
Federal support for this important hot-
line. 
Tragically, on average, five children 
die every day from child abuse and ne-
glect. According to the most recent De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices’ 
Child 
Maltreatment 
Report, 
656,000 children were victims of child 
abuse and neglect in 2019, and a heart-
breaking 1,770 children died—including 
three young children in Maine. The 
many stresses created by the COVID–19 
pandemic have exacerbated the risks 
for vulnerable children, and I fear that 
the data from 2020 and 2021 will show a 
worsening crisis. 
According to the CDC, ‘‘heightened 
stress, school closures, loss of income, 
and social isolation resulting from 
. . . . the COVID–19 pandemic have in-
creased the risk for child abuse and ne-
glect.’’ 
As 
Michelle 
Fingerman 
of 
Childhelp, the current operator of the 
Childhelp National Child Abuse Hot-
line, details: ‘‘There is a wide range of 
fallout from pandemic anxiety and 
school shutdowns. There is more abuse 
already occurring in homes where care-
givers are melting down from the 
stress, children are trapped at home 
with abusers, schools and daycare are 
closed, and therapists and other front-
line providers are now more difficult to 
access.’’ 
Despite these risks, official reports 
to child protection agencies have de-
clined across the country, in some 
places by as much as seventy percent. 
But, fewer official reports does not 
mean abuse and neglect are on the de-
cline. To the contrary, less in-person 
contact between children and man-
dated reporters like teachers, physi-
cians, and coaches is one explanation 
for this reporting decline. Additionally, 
while the number of emergency depart-
ment visits related to child abuse and 
neglect decreased in 2020, the percent-
age of visits severe enough to require 
hospitalization increased. Better ac-
cess to prevention and intervention 
services can help stop these troubling 
trends. 
The Childhelp National Child Abuse 
Hotline is a resource that is accessible 
to children and families across the 
country, especially while many chil-
dren are still not attending school in 
person full-time. A simple phone call 
or text to the hotline at 1–800–4–A– 
Child can connect people with those 
who can come to a child’s aid before 
the unimaginable occurs. The hotline 
saw 11,573 contacts in May 2020, which 
is more than 40 percent higher than 
during May 2019. Childhelp’s text and 
online chat platforms also experienced 
a significant volume increase last year. 
For the past few years, Congress has 
appropriated $1 million to pilot these 
platforms, and our legislation would 
help the grantee chosen by ACF expand 
its reach to more children and families. 
The helpline serves a wide range of 
individuals in every single state—at- 
risk children, distressed parents seek-
ing crisis intervention, and concerned 
individuals who suspect that child 
abuse may be occurring. In Maine, 
where one in every 71 children is a vic-
tim of abuse, the National Child Abuse 
Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers in 
2019. Those in need are connected—ei-
ther on the phone, text, or online

chat—with social workers who can 
offer confidential crisis intervention, 
information, and referrals to emer-
gency, social service, and support re-
sources. 
The National Child Abuse Help Hot-
line Act would provide a meaningful 
Federal investment to protect children 
across the country, authorizing $2 mil-
lion annually for the Administration 
for Children and Families (ACF) to 
award a grant to a nonprofit entity to 
support a 24-hour, national, toll-free 
telephone hotline. That hotline will get 
information and assistance to victims 
of child abuse or neglect, parents, care-
givers, mandated reporters, and other 
concerned community members. This 
will not interfere with any state-man-
dated reporter hotlines and will bolster 
those state efforts. In fact, the current 
operator has more than 80 community 
partners in just Maine alone. 
Mr. President, child abuse is prevent-
able, and the helpline’s prevention and 
intervention activities are both suc-
cessful 
and 
well-documented. 
Con-
sistent Federal support for the Na-
tional Child Abuse Hotline will im-
prove our ability to reach children of 
all ages, as well as parents or care-
givers, during the pandemic and be-
yond. I urge my colleagues to support 
the adoption of this important legisla-
tion that could save lives.

f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank the majority leader, and I thank 
the Presiding Officer for allowing me 
to speak this evening. 
I just returned from the southern 
border and want to give a brief report 
and talk about some potential ways 
forward to deal with what is happening 
on the Mexican border. I went with 
Secretary 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
Mayorkas and also with the chair of 
the Homeland Security Committee, my 
colleague from Michigan, and also with 
my colleague from West Virginia and 
my colleague from Connecticut, who 
are the chairs and ranking members of 
the Senate Homeland Security Appro-
priations Committee. We had a bipar-
tisan group and those of us who were 
involved on the authorizing side and on 
the appropriations side. 
You probably heard that the situa-
tion is bad, and it is. There is a record 
number 
of 
unaccompanied 
children 
coming to our border today, being let 
in, and ending up in Border Patrol de-
tention facilities. 
Just yesterday, CBP reported that 
there were more than 15,500 unaccom-
panied kids in Federal custody. That is 
a record. But it is not just children. 
More than 100,000 migrants were appre-
hended in February alone. This is a 15- 
year record, representing a 28-percent 
increase just since January. All the 
numbers from March look even higher. 
We won’t know the final numbers for 
another couple of weeks, but the point 
is, it is getting worse, not better. 
These numbers, by the way, are 
worse than the previous two surges at 
our southern border—both the 2014 
surge, we all remember, during the 
Obama administration and the 2019 
surge during the Trump administra-
tion. And, by the way, we have yet to

March 22, 2021 
reach the predicted peak because that 
normally would happen in April and 
May. In fact, the Secretary of Home-
land Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, 
who was with us on this trip, said that 
he believes this will be the worst year 
in 20 years for unlawful entry into the 
United States. 
However, the numbers only tell part 
of the story. This is also a humani-
tarian crisis. Migrants often face vio-
lence, sickness, and tough terrain on 
their dangerous journey north—pre-
dominantly, those from the Northern 
Triangle countries of Guatemala, Hon-
duras, El Salvador. Many are abused by 
the smugglers who charge them large 
amounts of money and bring them. 
Unfortunately, this is a crisis that 
could have been avoided. On day one, 
the Biden administration issued five 
Executive orders to overturn Trump 
policies and since has taken more than 
a half dozen additional actions to dis-
mantle policies from the previous ad-
ministration. 
These included a 100-day pause on all 
deportations; 
no 
longer 
using 
the 
COVID–19 healthcare emergency under 
title 42 of the United States Code to 
turn away unaccompanied children and 
some families; suspending the con-
struction of the border fence and tech-
nologies, such as sensors and scanners 
used by the Trump administration to 
help our overworked Border Patrol 
agents secure key stretches of our 
southern border; and abandoning the 
migrant 
protection 
protocols, 
also 
known as ‘‘Remain in Mexico,’’ which 
required some asylum seekers at the 
southern border to remain in Mexico 
rather than in the United States while 
their claim for asylum is being proc-
essed; and, of course, proposing an am-
nesty bill on day one. 
The administration has every right 
to do that, but it creates a disincentive 
to push back on new migrants coming 
in who are trying to get into the 
United States before that amnesty 
might become law. It certainly does 
unless you also make it clear that you 
don’t qualify for amnesty unless you 
are already here. And I think that is an 
important message that I hope will be 
part of any future discussions about 
any kind of an amnesty bill so it 
doesn’t 
encourage 
more 
people 
to 
come. 
The Biden administration took these 
and other actions that incentivize peo-
ple to head north but then said: Please 
don’t come yet. We are not ready for 
you. 
It was no surprise that didn’t work. 
An unprecedented number of children 
and families came to take advantage of 
the new policies. As I heard on the 
southern border over the last few days, 
actions speak louder than words. And 
the actions of the new administration 
were clear. 
These abrupt moves to dismantle the 
immigration policies that were work-
ing to provide a disincentive for unlaw-
ful migrations hit the green light to a 
lot of people seeking a better life, but 
it also gave the smugglers and the 
human trafficking groups in the North-
ern Triangle and in Mexico the ability 
to convince more families and more 
children to take the dangerous trip 
north. It gave them a narrative, and, of 
course, they used it to their full advan-
tage. That has overwhelmed Border Pa-
trol and our immigration system, in 
general, unequipped to handle the 
surge. 
I heard directly from Border Patrol 
agents about how the current surge of 
unaccompanied kids is draining re-
sources and endangering not just those 
vulnerable kids but the security of our 
own border. 
It was stunning to see people who un-
lawfully crossed the border during a 
ride-along patrol I joined on Thursday 
night. People just kept coming. The 
Border Patrol told me they are seeing 
an increase of about 150 to 200 percent 
of illegal entries in the El Paso sector, 
with many illegal crossers escaping 
into the United States because they 
have not apprehended them. 
Just as concerning, they told me un-
accompanied children and families are 
being used by the smugglers as a dis-
traction so the smugglers can more 
easily move dangerous and illicit sub-
stances across the border into our com-
munities. 
While the Border Patrol is busy proc-
essing the kids and the families, which 
takes a while, the smugglers move. In 
fact, Customs and Border Protection 
has reported an increase of 360 percent 
in seizures of the deadly synthetic 
opioid fentanyl, which is 50 times dead-
lier than heroin. 
There is no question that more of 
this is now coming across the border. It 
is already resulting in a surge of over-
dose deaths, by the way, over the past 
year during the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
my home State of Ohio and around the 
country, it looks like, sadly, we are in 
for a record year of overdose and over-
dose deaths, primarily from fentanyl 
and fentanyl being mixed with other 
drugs. 
Fentanyl used to come from China 
directly, mostly through our mail sys-
tem. Now, increasingly, it is coming 
from Mexico, since we passed legisla-
tion here to stop it coming through our 
mail system. 
Down at the border, I also had the op-
portunity to visit with the facilities 
where they are currently holding unac-
companied kids. These children are 
being kept in tightly packed facilities, 
supervised by overworked Border Pa-
trol agents, law enforcement, who 
should be out in the field. 
Due to a lack of space for children in 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services facilities, Border Patrol is 
having to detain unaccompanied kids 
for an average of about 137 hours, near-
ly double the 72-hour limit required by 
law. 
I am concerned about the well-being 
of these kids, as we all are, because 
when the system gets overwhelmed, 
people, and especially the kids, suffer. 
And the processing system right now is 
overwhelmed; it is overcrowded; it is 
irresponsible. It is a situation you 
would never want your own children to 
be in. Not only are these children 
crammed into the facilities that are, 
by their own rules and regulations, 
overcrowded, there is no testing for 
COVID–19 in these facilities. Current 
policy is going to result in tens of 
thousands more children being released 
into our communities, waiting for their 
immigration court cases. 
During previous surges at the border 
that overwhelmed our immigration 
system, HHS stopped doing background 
checks on sponsors for unaccompanied 
kids, and many fell into the custody of 
abusive human traffickers. In 2014, for 
example, HHS placed Guatemalan chil-
dren with criminals who put the chil-
dren into forced labor on an egg farm 
in my home State of Ohio, where they 
were forced to live and work in squalid 
conditions. 
It is an issue I have worked a long 
time on. Between 2015 and to 2020, as 
chair of the Permanent Subcommittee 
on Investigations, I led three bipar-
tisan reports and hearings across two 
administrations that found repeated 
failures by the Federal Government to 
ensure the well-being of these vulner-
able children once they were handed off 
to sponsors, as well as the fundamental 
refusal by HHS to accept that they 
were responsible for the welfare of 
these kids they placed with adults who 
are not their legal parent or guardian. 
Obviously, we are going to see a lot 
more pressure to get these kids out to 
as many sponsors as quickly as pos-
sible, and, again, I believe we are going 
to have some of these problems. 
Last week, I introduced bipartisan 
legislation called the Responsibility 
for Unaccompanied Minors Act that 
will direct the Federal Government to 
meet the stringent requirements nec-
essary to ensure children are not 
abused or exploited by their sponsors; 
that they show up for their asylum 
hearings to determine their eligibility 
to stay in the United States. These are 
necessary steps to address the current 
crisis at our border and safeguard these 
children. 
By the way, on the debate as to 
whether to call the chaos at the border 
a crisis or not, when I was on the bor-
der talking to Border Patrol agents, 
one of them told me, although he be-
lieves it is a crisis, that he is fine not 
calling it a crisis now because he 
knows it is going to get much worse, 
and he wants to have something to call 
it then. He wants to see, like all Amer-
icans, concrete actions and a change of 
course at the border, much more than 
having a debate about words. By the 
way, we should all sympathize with 
those migrants who want a better life 
for their families. I sympathize with 
them. I am sure we all do. 
There are millions of people around 
the world who want to come to our 
country. We have a legal immigration 
system that accepts a million people a

year. In addition to that, we accept ref-
ugees and those who apply for asylum. 
At the end of the day, those individuals 
coming to our southern border right 
now are making a rational choice to 
come to the border based on policy de-
cisions by the Biden administration. 
What we need is a legal, orderly, and 
proper system to be sure the people fol-
low the rules. 
The bottom line is, what I saw at the 
border is unsustainable, and, unfortu-
nately, it is going to get worse. We are 
working against the clock to try to 
find a way forward. 
When 
the 
Biden 
administration 
changed the rules and dismantled the 
existing provisions that were keeping 
people from coming across the border, 
they could have put their own policies 
in place to try to deal with what every-
body predicted was a surge that was 
coming. They didn’t. More to the point, 
even if they weren’t going to put their 
own policies in place, they should sure-
ly have waited until they had the fa-
cilities ready to handle the surge. They 
didn’t. That is why you see this ter-
rible overcrowding at Border Patrol de-
tention facilities, holding these kids 
much longer than they should, and why 
you see HHS not having the beds pre-
pared that they should have. 
By the way, some have said the 
Trump administration dismantled the 
asylum system. Well, because of the 
rules they had in place, there were very 
few people coming to apply for asylum. 
The facility I saw, which was a modern 
facility built just last year with $48 
million of our taxpayer money, was 
built to try to deal with the next surge. 
Unfortunately, it is not big enough, 
and, again, it is overcrowded, so you 
have kids sleeping on the floor on thin 
foam mattresses with only a space 
blanket. None of them have been 
checked for COVID. They are living not 
6 feet apart, as we are required to do 
here with social distancing, but inches 
apart and together. 
It is one thing to say we are going to 
change all these policies. It is another 
thing to say we are not going to put 
anything in its place or because that is 
OK—we are OK to have a surge come— 
at least to be prepared for that surge, 
and that is not what is happening. 
I believe there is a path forward for 
the Biden administration and the Con-
gress to address this crisis in the short 
term; then work on medium- and long- 
term solutions to lower the risk of fu-
ture surges. 
Here is what I would propose. First 
and foremost, the Biden administration 
should recommit to enforcing our im-
migration laws by providing over-
whelmed Border Patrol agents and our 
Immigration and Customs the help 
they need to be able to ensure they can 
get what they need to be able to en-
force the law. That means better pay 
for our Border Patrol. It also means 
better overtime provisions. We have 
legislation to do that. 
It also means ensuring that they 
have the tools they need to be able to 
protect the country. That means not 
stopping construction of the fence, 
which, by the way, is almost done. In 
the El Paso sector, I think there is 150 
miles of fence totally—in total, 124 
miles is already done. The parts that 
are not done, unfortunately, are some 
of the gates, so you have gaps. Border 
Patrol are very frustrated by this be-
cause they literally have to have peo-
ple at the gaps because they can’t mon-
itor them as they can with the fence 
because with the fence, it takes people 
a while to get over the fence. With 
monitoring devices, which are, to me, 
more important even than the fence 
itself, they are able to do their jobs. 
They are also being told they can’t 
continue the technology, so although 
there is 124 miles of fencing, there is 
much less technology than that. Yet 
they have been stopped from doing that 
as well. 
Let’s give them what they need to be 
able to do their jobs. They are in an 
impossible situation. I am not talking 
about a new fence or a new wall, but at 
least for the part that has already been 
appropriated by Congress, let’s com-
plete it. Let’s not leave these gaps. 
I literally saw the supplies they have. 
Construction 
material 
is 
on 
the 
ground, and the Border Patrol agents 
told me—these are rank-and-file Bor-
der Patrol agents: This is bad for mo-
rale. We see this stuff right there. If 
that could be put up to take the place 
of the temporary fencing migrants are 
able to simply push over or walk 
through, that would make our jobs 
much easier. 
No. 2, the asylum system needs to be 
changed immediately. Now, with a 
backlog of 1.2 million asylum seekers, 
they are waiting several years for 
court hearings to find out if they are 
qualified. During that time, they are 
living in the United States and often 
vanishing into the United States. We 
know from the data we have—and, by 
the way, the data is not very good on 
this—that only about half of them, 
maybe more or maybe less, are even 
showing up for their court cases. We 
know this because, for about 48 percent 
of those who are seeking asylum, there 
are now removal orders out for them 
for not showing up for their hearings. 
So about half of them have removal or-
ders to be removed from the country 
because they haven’t shown up for 
their hearings. Remember, this is a 1.2 
million-person backlog, so it may be 3, 
4, 5, 6 years before they get to their 
court cases. Is there any wonder some 
of these people are not showing up? 
Finally, at the very end of the proc-
ess, after you go through all the adju-
dication, guess what the percentage of 
success 
would 
be 
for 
someone 
to 
achieve an asylum status: only 15 per-
cent—15 percent—have a successful 
claim. So people are being told to go 
into the country and await their court 
cases, and 1.2 million people are doing 
that. It takes several years for that to 
happen. At the end of the day, only 15 
percent will get asylum. 
Yet, again, many are not being re-
moved even though there is a removal 
order out on them because the immi-
gration system is overwhelmed, so they 
are focusing on those who have a crimi-
nal record, which I understand. This 
means, if you don’t have a criminal 
record and you are in the United 
States, you know that it is unlikely 
you will actually be removed even if 
there is a removal order for you. 
So one policy change would be to 
simply resume a practice that was 
started in the last administration as a 
pilot and ended in November 2020. It is 
called the Prompt Asylum Claim Re-
view process. An efficient and timely 
determination of who is eligible for 
asylum and who is not would really 
help. It would enable us to start reduc-
ing the number of migrants being held 
in custody and deter migrants who do 
not have a valid claim. 
You might say: Why not start with 
the 1.2 million backlog? That would be 
great. We should do that as well. We 
need more immigration judges. We 
need more lawyers involved in the 
process, on both sides, representing 
those who have the claim and rep-
resenting the government. That would 
be good, but in the meantime, these 
rapid adjudications on the border with 
due process would have the effect of de-
terring the next migrant. Think about 
it. If you are just dealing with the last 
person on the list, the person who 
comes in most recently gets more of a 
deterrent than if you are dealing with 
the person who came in 4 or 5 years ago 
because they think: Well, if I get up 
there and make my claim and come 
into the United States and go out into 
one of the communities represented in 
this body, it will be 4 or 5 years before 
my court case comes up. Perhaps there 
will be amnesty during that period or 
something else or perhaps I will just 
stay. 
If you come to the border and you 
seek amnesty—you seek asylum—your 
claim will be adjudicated immediately, 
and you may receive asylum or you 
may not. Again, 15 percent is the num-
ber now. That is the best number we 
have, and that is from 2019. We don’t 
have the numbers from 2020 yet. Most 
think that is about what it will be. 
I think this is a good system. I don’t 
know why it was ended in the Trump 
administration back in November. It 
shouldn’t have been. I hope the new ad-
ministration will take it up. 
As part of this, my colleagues from 
Texas and Arizona, Senator CORNYN 
and Senator SINEMA, have suggested we 
stand up multiple regional processing 
centers to rapidly and fairly conduct 
asylum cases in one location. I support 
that. I think this idea is consistent 
with what I am talking about to dis-
courage illegal immigration and to en-
sure that we have a quick decision with 
regard to asylum. Have all the Federal 
Agencies together—Border Patrol, Cus-
toms and Border Protection, ICE, the 
Justice Department, HHS—everybody 
together in one place, and quickly

March 22, 2021 
make these decisions so that people 
aren’t held for a long period of time, so 
they can have the decision made. 
I think it is worth the funding be-
cause it will be expensive. It will be ex-
pensive to hire the new immigration 
judges to have the system set up, but it 
is well worth it, in my view. 
Third, to deal with the asylum proc-
ess, the Biden administration should 
look at the new Migrant Protection 
Protocols or ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ pol-
icy. ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ allowed us to 
keep our detention center populations 
down in the United States and asylum 
seekers 
close 
to 
the 
immigration 
courts while officials sorted out the 
claims. Getting rid of the policy served 
only to overcrowd our temporary hous-
ing and sent a lot more people into the 
interior, awaiting a hearing by an im-
migration judge. 
There are concerns about ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ in terms of the conditions at 
some of the camps in Mexico. Although 
nongovernmental organizations play a 
substantial role there already, perhaps 
for those who are still in that process— 
and there are probably 45,000 people 
who are still in that process; there 
were initially maybe less, but, ini-
tially, there were about 75,000 people— 
a lot of people have just gone home be-
cause they don’t want to remain in 
Mexico for their asylum claim. They 
would rather go back to their home in 
Northern Triangle countries—Guate-
mala, Honduras, El Salvador—but for 
those who are there, perhaps there 
should be more oversight of those 
camps and more Federal funding pro-
vided through the U.N. High Commis-
sioner for Refugees, HCR, and others to 
ensure those conditions are better. 
What the Biden administration is 
doing now is saying ‘‘We are going to 
stop the program,’’ and they are bring-
ing people over the border. I saw this, 
the processing center. About 350 or 450 
people a day are leaving the ‘‘Remain 
in Mexico,’’ the Migrant Protection 
Protocols Program, and coming into 
the United States. Those people are 
given the ability to come into the inte-
rior, so they are coming into commu-
nities in the United States. 
One thing you would hope they would 
get would be a notice as they go 
through the processing that says: Here 
is your court date. You have to show 
up at this court date. 
What we have learned in the last sev-
eral days or what I learned down at the 
border is that they are not being given 
those court dates. They are given a 
piece of paper that has 24 ICE offices in 
the major metropolitan areas in Amer-
ica, and they are told: We don’t know 
where you are going to end up. We 
don’t know where you are going. You 
are welcome in the United States, but 
wherever you are going, please check 
into the ICE office in your region. 
My hope is we can at least get a sys-
tem together where we don’t, again, 
dismantle a program until we have 
something in its place to ensure people 
are going to their court dates to be 
able to have the asylum claims dealt 
with. 
On my trip to the border, I asked a 
reporter to come with me to the border 
wall because I believe it is important 
that the public know what is going on. 
I was surprised to learn that was the 
first time this reporter or other report-
ers had been able to kind of see what 
was going on for quite a while. They 
haven’t been able to come into any of 
the detention facilities, including the 
processing center I talked about ear-
lier, where the kids are crammed into— 
100 kids crammed into 1 room. I think 
the press should be able to see that be-
cause I think that will provide more 
transparency for all of us. 
My constituents don’t know what is 
going on at the border, in part because 
the media haven’t had that level of ac-
cess. I know we have to protect the 
confidentiality of individual migrants, 
and I get that. I think that should be 
done. I think it can be done, but also 
by letting the media have that access, 
we would be able to have more trans-
parency about the realities of what is 
going on along the border. 
So, fourth, I think the Biden admin-
istration should invest in finishing the 
work on the fence, as I said, but they 
should also work to enact something 
that is even more important than a 
fence, and that is to relieve the mag-
net. This is going to involve Congress. 
We did pass an immigration bill in 
this body with a strong provision 
called E-Verify several years ago. It 
basically says that for employers, 
there will be a sanction if you hire 
somebody who is not legal. The dif-
ference between E-Verify and some of 
the earlier programs that attempted to 
do that unsuccessfully is that E-Verify 
lets us use the new technologies we 
now have to ensure that fraudulent 
documents that are often used can be 
determined to be fraudulent. In other 
words, you can use technology—facial 
recognition and so on—to ensure that 
the employer knows for sure whether 
the person is legal or not. 
Again, this requires some Federal 
funding. Some of that software for 
small businesses, in particular, may be 
expensive, but to have an E-Verify Pro-
gram that says you mandatorily—by 
the way, it is not mandatory right now 
either. It doesn’t have the technology. 
It is not mandatory. You have to make 
it mandatory and say: If you want to 
hire somebody, you have to run them 
through the system. Make it as easy as 
possible to use the technology. 
In talking to the migrants I met— 
and my colleagues have spoken to 
many people who have come to this 
country, and I am sure they have had 
the same experience—when I asked 
them why they are coming here, they 
all have the same answer, basically, 
with slight variations, which is, as one 
guy told me from Guatemala, he can 
make 10 times as much money here. He 
cares about his family and their future. 
The economy is much better here, but 
that is because he knows he can get a 
job probably with a document, either a 
driver’s license or a Social Security 
card that will be fraudulent, but he can 
buy it for 25 bucks. So we need a sys-
tem here to stop the magnet. 
Don’t put the Border Patrol and all 
of those involved—the immigration 
system is in such an impossible posi-
tion that we have a wide-open system 
here where anybody can come and 
work. 
Let’s do E-Verify. That is more im-
portant to me than any other enforce-
ment tool that we have. Federal Re-
serve economists found that States 
that mandate the use of E-Verify re-
duce the number of likely unauthorized 
immigrants who stay in that State. Of 
course it does. 
Sixth—and this is the final one—the 
Biden administration should work with 
our Central American partners, includ-
ing the Governments of Mexico, Guate-
mala, Honduras, and El Salvador, to 
discourage unlawful migration. They 
can do that by incentivizing migrants 
to apply for asylum in their countries 
of origin. Some have said this should 
be mandatory. To me, that seems to 
make sense. Maybe there is a reason it 
shouldn’t be mandatory, but it cer-
tainly should be encouraged, and these 
countries should certainly offer this. 
We should provide more aid to the 
countries of Central America because 
there is a push factor. Everything I 
have talked about so far is the pull fac-
tors, bringing them in. But if we do 
that, that aid ought to be conditioned 
on them helping us to provide people 
the ability to seek asylum in their own 
country. Where they have such a fear 
of persecution that they can’t do it in 
their own country, they should be able 
to do it in a third country. 
There was a program started in the 
Trump administration that never real-
ly got off the ground, and it was called 
Safe Third Country. The program with 
Guatemala was starting to work. Hon-
duras and El Salvador had signed up, 
but it hadn’t started to work yet. Mex-
ico didn’t provide it. But what it says 
basically is, if you cross through a 
third country, you have to seek asylum 
in that third country. 
Specifically with Guatemala—as you 
know, you have to go through Guate-
mala coming from Honduras or El Sal-
vador or Ecuador or elsewhere. Why 
not have the asylum claims done 
there? Again, due process, yes, but 
don’t make people take this long and 
treacherous journey up to the southern 
border of the United States. Don’t 
make them go through this process of 
the detention facilities and so on. Have 
them seek asylum in their own country 
or in other countries. That, to me, 
seems like it makes a lot of sense. 
The Biden administration suspended 
the Safe Third Country program on 
February 6, shortly after the inaugura-
tion. 
One program they would like to re-
start that I think makes sense is called 
the Central American Minors Program. 
They are going to restart that program

March 22, 2021 
now, starting in March. This is a pro-
gram where, during the Obama admin-
istration, if you had a family member, 
a parent—it had to be a parent or a 
guardian—in the United States legally, 
then you could come through this pro-
gram called CAM, Central American 
Minors Program. I am glad they have 
restarted that program. That makes 
sense. I will tell you, over 5 years, only 
3,500 kids were processed in that pro-
gram. Again, your parent has to be in 
the United States legally. There are 
3,500 kids coming across our border 
every 9 days right now. So the program 
is not going to solve all our problems, 
but it will help, and that is a good idea. 
We need to take a hard look at all of 
this, at all of these pull factors we 
talked about and certainly at the push 
factors. 
I will say that the Biden administra-
tion has proposed $4 billion to go to 
these three countries—Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Honduras. As a Congress, we 
have appropriated and $3.6 billion has 
been spent in the last 5 years in these 
three countries. So we have done al-
most that much in the last 5 years, and 
yet, because of the corruption, because 
of the lack of transparency, because of 
the lack of rule of law, the money has 
not been as effectively spent as it 
should have been. So we have to be 
sure the money is conditioned upon re-
forms to actually improve the lives of 
the individuals in those countries. De-
spite the corruption, we need to cut 
through that and say: If you take this 
money, you have to commit to the re-
forms. Second, again, it should be con-
tingent upon helping with our asylum 
system to be sure that we can deal 
with this surge that we are now facing. 
If the Biden administration takes 
these six recommended actions I have 
laid out today, I believe we would move 
toward bringing a quicker end to this 
crisis on the border, and we would be 
able to secure our southern border with 
regard to the drugs that are coming 
over and other contraband and be able 
to say that we, together, worked on 
this. 
I know this is a time where every-
body is in their corner, the Republicans 
and Democrats, and it is impossible, it 
seems like, to make progress. But I 
think these are pretty sensible ideas, 
and the alternative is a bad one: that 
this is going to get worse. You will 
have more and more kids in detention 
centers. You will have more and more 
families released to communities in 
the United States where they don’t 
come forward for their hearings. And it 
is something that discourages people 
about our immigration system. It just 
doesn’t seem to work. It is certainly 
not working on the border today. 
So my hope is that these ideas or 
others—maybe others in this Chamber 
have better ideas, but hopefully they 
can be bipartisan, and we can get some 
of this stuff done and actually deal 
with the crisis we all know exists and 
we have a responsibility to face.
