DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
April 26, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY C.

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, we lift up our voices 
to You. We come into Your presence 
with singing. Granted, some of us can 
only make a joyful noise and others are 
hard-pressed to carry anything close to 
a melodious tune, but we rejoice know-
ing You are the one who made us. We 
each belong to You. In this we find our 
delight. 
So may we serve You with gladness, 
that our voices would speak of Your in-
finite goodness. Give us gentle words to 
turn away the asperity of dissent and 
divisiveness. Restrain our harsh words 
that we would not contribute to quar-
rels nor fuel dispute. 
We are the sheep of Your pasture. 
May we enter Your gates with praise. 
May we fill Your courts, this Chamber, 
with thanksgiving. 
For You, the Lord, are good, and 
Your steadfast love endures forever. 
Your faithfulness is to all generations. 
In the joy of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. KAPTUR led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
TRANSATLANTIC 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS SECURITY ACT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge passage of the bipartisan 
Transatlantic Telecommunications Se-
curity 
Act 
that 
Congressman 
KINZINGER and I have introduced. 
Central and Eastern European na-
tions are working to develop the mod-
ern telecommunications infrastructure 
necessary 
to 
facilitate 
global 
connectivity in the 21st century. At 
the same time, China, through its Belt 
and Road Initiative, is strategically in-
ducing dependence on its financing and 
technology to construct these projects, 
endangering liberty and security. 
5G technology represents the future 
of global communications. We must 
not allow those who are hostile to free-
dom and democracy to dominate this 
technological space and undermine sta-
bility. 
Our allies need American financing 
and partnership. Through the Trans-
atlantic Telecommunications Security 
Act, let us construct and deploy the 
state-of-the-art 
networks 
that 
will 
spur economic prosperity and connect 
people and communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I invite all my col-
leagues to join us in this bill. We must 
stand with our European allies against 
the threats posed by foreign adver-
saries. And please, help us pass the 
Transatlantic Telecommunications Se-
curity Act without delay. 
f 
TITLE 42 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, I visited with the 
police officers in Johnstown, Pennsyl-
vania, to hear firsthand about the drug 
epidemic that is facing communities in 
my district. 
One of the officers told me a story of 
how just the night before, he recovered 
over 150 bags of heroin after receiving a 
911 call for a man abusing a puppy on a 
public street. This story gets to the 
heart of what these deadly drugs do to 
our communities. 
Instead of addressing this crisis by 
securing our border, President Biden 
has chosen to end title 42, a program 
that has helped our Border Patrol 
agents protect Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to fight the 
drug epidemic that has allowed heroin, 
crack cocaine, and fentanyl to take the 
lives of so many Pennsylvanians, so 
many Americans. 
It is time to secure our border and 
make title 42 the law of the land. 
It is time to face the drug crisis head 
on. 
It is time to protect all of our com-
munities.

WE ARE A NATION OF 
IMMIGRANTS

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4462 
April 26, 2022 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, 
we 
find 
ourselves 
in 
an 
unguided, misguided debate about the 
fundamental concept of our nation of 
immigrants. We find ourselves in a de-
bate trying to deny what we really are, 
a nation of immigrants. 
Mr. Speaker, let me remind you, on 
average, TPS holders have lived in the 
United States for over 22 years—many 
of them hailing from Latin American 
countries. Redesignating and desig-
nating TPS would be a wise thing for 
over 2 million people already residing 
in the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition, families 
often have to wait decades before they 
reunite with their family members; 
sometimes four decades, three decades, 
before they reunite with their children. 
Mr. Speaker, 4 million people are 
waiting to reunite with their families. 
United families are stronger. United 
families make America stronger. Let’s 
unite the families. That is a family 
value. Unity of the family is a family 
value that we must protect. 
Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of im-
migrants. 
f 
EULOGY FOR FINANCIAL 
LITERACY MONTH 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, April is Fi-
nancial Literacy Month, the perfect 
time to remind Americans just how fi-
nancially irresponsible Democrats are. 
Democrats have used the pocketbooks 
of hardworking Americans to fund a 
multitrillion-dollar spending spree and 
now have the audacity to deny respon-
sibility for the inflation crisis. This in-
cludes extending the student loan re-
payment 
moratorium 
three 
times, 
costing taxpayers over $150 billion. 
Democrats are financially irrespon-
sible and are dragging student bor-
rowers along with them. In January, 
the administration announced it would 
no longer require borrowers to sign an 
online acknowledgment about their 
total student debt each year before 
taking out additional loans. We should 
make it easier for student borrowers to 
understand the gravity of taking out 
tens of thousands of dollars in student 
loan debt, not hiding it from them. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Democrats’ 
policies 
don’t promote financial literacy, they 
promote financial illiteracy. 
f 
HONORING YARELIS HERNANDEZ 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the accomplish-
ments of an engineer from my district. 
Yarelis Hernandez of Clinton was re-
cently recognized by the National As-
sociation of Manufacturers with the 
Women in Manufacturing STEP Ahead 
Awards. This award is awarded to 
women who have demonstrated excep-
tional leadership in the manufacturing 
field. 
Diversity is a passion of Yarelis’ as 
she serves on LyondellBasell’s Diver-
sity, Equity, and Leadership Council 
striving to implement diversity in the 
workforce. 
In the community, Yarelis also sits 
on the local economic board leading de-
velopment between schools and cor-
porations to create jobs for Iowa stu-
dents. Yarelis volunteers in the local 
Introduce a Girl to Engineering pro-
gram, which is a mentorship for girls 
interested in STEM careers. 
Yarelis’ dedication to promoting di-
versity and STEM for young girls is 
why she is worthy of receiving such a 
prestigious award. I am so proud to 
represent distinguished women like 
Yarelis and cannot wait to see her con-
tinued impact in the district.

PRAYERS FOR OFFICER DREW 
BARR 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the Midlands of South Caro-
lina were shocked to learn of the shoot-
ing death Sunday of Cayce police offi-
cer, Andrew ‘‘Drew’’ Barr, age 27. 
Killed in the line of duty, Officer 
Barr was a brave, dedicated public 
servant, who will always be cherished 
as a champion for law and order. 
Officer Barr was familiar with dan-
ger. Shortly after graduating from the 
South Carolina Criminal Justice Acad-
emy in 2017, he and another Cayce po-
lice officer were shot during an inci-
dent that involved a car chase and foot 
pursuit. They were awarded medals for 
bravery. 
‘‘Our hearts are breaking in Cayce. 
Officer Drew Barr has been an impor-
tant part of the Cayce family since 
2016,’’ heralded by Cayce Mayor Elise 
Partin. 
‘‘Officer Barr gave the ultimate sac-
rifice for us to make us safe,’’ con-
firmed by Cayce Police Chief Chris 
Cowan. 
Cayce is fortunate to have Mayor 
Partin, Chief Cowan, and a law-enforce-
ment-experienced 
councilman, 
Tim 
James. 
Our prayers for the family of Texas 
National Guardsman Bishop Evans, 
who is a hero for trying to protect the 
drug-infested southern border. 
God 
bless 
Ukraine. 
God 
bless 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
f 
PRESIDENT ULYSSES S. GRANT 
200TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 200th birthday 
of our 18th United States President, 
Ulysses S. Grant. 
President Grant was born in Point 
Pleasant, located in Clermont County 
in Ohio’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. When Ulysses was a child, the 
Grant family moved to Brown County, 
also in Ohio’s Second District, and 
there he was educated before accepting 
a nomination to the United States 
Military Academy at West Point. 
Following his commissioning, Grant 
served in the Mexican-American War, 
and most notably, the Civil War, where 
he became Commanding General of the 
United States Army in 1864. 
General Grant oversaw the surrender 
of General Lee at Appomattox Court 
House and served as Commanding Gen-
eral of the Army until he was elected 
President in 1868. He served two terms 
as President, overseeing the beginning 
of the Reconstruction Era in the 
United States. 
President Grant is the General who 
‘‘saved the Union.’’ He was a great 
leader who left his mark in American 
history. We should all seek to follow 
his example and leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have 
President Grant’s birthplace in Ohio’s 
Second Congressional District, a true 
landmark of our Nation’s history.

IN HONOR OF NATIONAL 
INFERTILITY AWARENESS WEEK 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Flor-
ida’s 20th Congressional District to rec-
ognize the necessary work of the Na-
tional Infertility Association in honor 
of 
National 
Infertility 
Awareness 
Week. This week brings together mil-
lions of Americans who want to remove 
the stigma and the barriers that stand 
in the way of building families. 
Mr. Speaker, one in eight couples 
have trouble getting pregnant or sus-
taining pregnancies, and many more 
people face barriers to building a fam-
ily. Through national media, social 
media, and fundraising, the infertility 
community will take action to in-
crease awareness of infertility in order 
to remove stigmas and improve access 
to healthy family-building options. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we do the same 
thing for infertility issues like we did 
for the Affordable Insulin Act. 
f 
TSA MASK MANDATE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, U.S. District Judge Kathryn 
Mizelle voided President Biden and the 
CDC’s overbearing and unnecessary 
mask mandate for airplanes and public 
transportation. 
After the announcement, I saw many 
videos online of many flyers and flight 
attendants joyously ripping off their 
masks to celebrate. I had urged, along

with many other colleagues in a couple 
of different letters to the President, to 
allow the mask mandate to expire a 
few months ago. So finally, I was re-
lieved and pleased to hear of this an-
nouncement by the judge. 
Our celebration was short-lived, how-
ever, as the Biden administration soon 
announced they would sue to try to re-
peal the judge’s ruling and force back 
in place mask mandates for people 
traveling. 
Science has repeatedly found that 
the masks are not nearly as effective 
at preventing the spread of COVID as 
they previously had thought. It really 
boils down to that government likes 
controlling people with this. They like 
scaring them. They like putting them 
in a box and saying, If you don’t do 
this, you might die. 
People, if they are forced into having 
mask mandates on public transpor-
tation once again, there is going to be 
a lot of anger coming out that no mid-
terms or nothing else will save if they 
force this onto us.

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I thank 
all of our members for their tireless 
work on the bills before us today. As 
we head into National Small Business 
Week, the legislation we are passing 
today showcases the bipartisan nature 
of our committee and highlights how 
Congress supports the American entre-
preneurial spirit. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6445, 
the Small Business Development Cen-
ter Improvement Act of 2022, intro-
duced by Representative GOLDEN from 
Maine and the late Representative 
Hagedorn from Minnesota. 
I will take a moment to remember 
the late Representative Hagedorn and 
his work as a member of the Small 
Business 
Committee. 
Before 
and 
throughout his illness, Mr. Hagedorn 
maintained his steadfast commitment 
to small businesses. My thoughts con-
tinue to be with Mr. Hagedorn’s family, 
friends, and staff. 
Today’s bill is a testament to his 
dedication to his community and small 
firms, and I am glad to honor his mem-
ory with this legislation. 
H.R. 6445 strengthens SBA’s largest 
resource partner, the Small Business 
Development Center, or SBDC, net-
work, by modernizing the program to 
meet the needs of today’s small busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs. 
SBDCs deliver free face-to-face and 
virtual counseling and training in all 
aspects of business management to 
small 
business 
owners 
and 
entre-
preneurs across the country. The serv-
ices include: assisting entrepreneurs 
with developing a business plan, ac-
cessing capital, creating a marketing 
plan, procuring government contracts, 
strengthening 
cybersecurity 
protec-
tions, and entering into international 
trade. 
Through their network of 62 lead cen-
ters, managing nearly 1,000 outreach 
locations, SBDCs assist small business 
owners and entrepreneurs throughout 
the country. 
SBDCs are a remarkable investment 
of taxpayer dollars with every Federal 
dollar spent on the SBDC program gen-
erating $1.99 in Federal revenue, a 
nearly 100 percent return on invest-
ment. 
To build on this success, H.R. 6445 in-
creases the authorization level to $175 
million for the next four fiscal years, 
allowing the program to grow and 
reach more of America’s 30 million 
small firms. 
The bill also clarifies that SBDCs, 
and the SBA, may actively market 
their services. In the Small Business 
Committee, we often say that SBDCs 
are the best-kept small business secret. 
This bill will go a long way to ensur-
ing more small employers and entre-
preneurs are aware that free or low- 
cost counseling and training exists to 
help them on their path to success. 
I thank the sponsors for leading this 
effort to modernize and improve the 
SBDC program and its many valuable 
services. I urge Members to support 
this bipartisan piece of legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6445, the Small Business Development 
Centers Improvement Act of 2022. 
Before we begin, I will highlight next 
week’s National Small Business Week 
celebration. This will be a time to 
honor and reflect upon some of Amer-
ica’s hardest working businesses and 
their employees. 
It is with this in mind that I am glad 
that we are gathering on the House 
floor today to discuss a number of bills 
that improve and enhance the Small 
Business Administration. 
Importantly, all five bills that we 
will be discussing today have been fa-
vorably reported out of our committee

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4465 
April 26, 2022 
in a bipartisan manner. I thank the 
chair for working with me to advance 
these bills to the floor. 
Small Business Development Centers 
provide valuable resources and free 
counseling to entrepreneurs across this 
great Nation. This Congress, I have 
heard from several small businesses 
who have benefited from the SBDC’s 
services. 
In my home State of Missouri, the 
Missouri Small Business Development 
Center helped a local brewery create a 
business plan and apply for a 504 loan 
to grow their business. They also 
helped a veteran-owned food shipping 
business scale up and find new partner-
ships during the pandemic. 
They supported countless small busi-
nesses in accessing SBA’s COVID relief 
programs such as the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and Economic Injury 
Disaster loans. I am grateful for their 
wide 
range 
of 
services 
to 
entre-
preneurs. 
This important legislation will allow 
SBDCs to continue their important 
services and expand their network of 
small business beneficiaries through 
marketing. 
This legislation also ensures SBDC’s 
client information is protected and 
that cooperation, communication, and 
collaboration between SBA and SBDC 
networks is improved. 
I thank Mr. GOLDEN for working on 
this legislation with the late Jim 
Hagedorn. As we all know, Jim was a 
champion for small businesses and a 
truly invaluable member of our Small 
Business Committee. He will certainly 
be missed. He leaves a huge hole on our 
side of the aisle with regard to support 
of small businesses, and we remember 
him today. 
I also thank the chair for working 
with me in a bipartisan manner to ad-
vance this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to ensure that 
SBDCs can continue serving our small 
business 
constituents 
and 
commu-
nities, and to support H.R. 6445, which 
was passed favorably out of our com-
mittee by a voice vote and passed the 
House in a similar form last Congress. 
The Small Business Development 
Center network is critical in assisting 
our small business owners during their 
entrepreneurial business journey. H.R. 
6445 will enhance and improve this 
journey and ensure the program re-
mains strong and vibrant on behalf of 
America’s small businesses. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
6445, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
There is no question that we need to 
support the cornerstone of the SBA’s 
entrepreneurial programs, the Small 
Business Development Centers. SBDCs 
are SBA’s premier resource partner 
with centers in communities across the 
country. Their free or low-cost coun-
seling and training have helped sustain 
small businesses and entrepreneurs 
throughout the pandemic. 
H.R. 6445 continues the long tradition 
of SBDC’s work to meet the ever-evolv-
ing needs of America’s entrepreneurs 
as they emerge from the pandemic. 
Strengthening the SBDC network will, 
in turn, provide the support our small 
businesses need in order to thrive. 
Today’s bill is endorsed by America’s 
SBDCs, an association representing the 
63 SBDC networks and their nearly 
1,000 centers. 
I thank Mr. GOLDEN and remember 
the late Mr. Hagedorn for their bipar-
tisan work on this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6445. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
WOMEN’S BUSINESS CENTERS

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

purposes.

‘‘(B) MODIFICATIONS PROHIBITED AFTER AN-
NOUNCEMENT.—With respect to a public an-
nouncement of any opportunity to be award-
ed a grant under this section made by the

tions issued pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such opportunity unless re-
quired to do so by an Act of Congress or an 
order of a Federal court. 
‘‘(C) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this paragraph may be construed as prohib-
iting the Administrator from modifying the 
regulations issued pursuant to subparagraph 
(A) (after providing an opportunity for no-
tice and comment) as such regulations apply 
to an opportunity to be awarded a grant 
under this section that the Administrator 
has not yet publicly announced pursuant to 
subsection (l)(1). 
‘‘(e) MATCHING REQUIREMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (5), 
upon approval of an application submitted

et line items only, including office equip-

other provision of law, an eligible entity 
may— 
‘‘(A) solicit cash and in-kind contributions 
from private individuals and entities to be 
used to operate a women’s business center; 
and 
‘‘(B) use amounts made available by the 
Administrator under this section for the cost 
of such solicitation and management of the 
contributions received. 
‘‘(4) DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.—The Admin-
istrator may disburse an amount not greater 
than 25 percent of the total amount of a 
grant awarded to an eligible entity before 
such eligible entity obtains the matching 
funds described under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(5) FAILURE TO OBTAIN MATCHING FUNDS.— 
If an eligible entity fails to obtain the re-
quired matching funds described under para-
graph (1), the eligible entity may not be eli-
gible to receive advance disbursements pur-
suant to paragraph (4) during the remainder 
of the term, if applicable, of an initial grant 
awarded under this section. Before approving 
such eligible entity for a continuation grant 
under this section, the Administrator shall 
make a written determination, including the 
reasons for such determination, of whether 
the Administrator believes that the eligible 
entity will be able to obtain the requisite 
matching funding under paragraph (1) for 
such continuation grant. 
‘‘(6) WAIVER OF NON-FEDERAL SHARE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Upon request by an eli-
gible entity and in accordance with this 
paragraph, the Administrator may waive, in 
whole or in part, the requirement to obtain 
matching funds under paragraph (1) for a 
grant awarded under this section for the eli-
gible entity for a 1-year term of the grant. 
‘‘(B) 
CONSIDERATIONS.—In 
determining 
whether to issue a waiver under this para-
graph, the Administrator shall consider— 
‘‘(i) the economic conditions affecting the 
eligible entity; 
‘‘(ii) the demonstrated ability of the eligi-
ble entity to raise non-Federal funds; and 
‘‘(iii) the performance of the eligible entity 
under the initial grant. 
‘‘(C) LIMITATION.—The Administrator may 
not issue a waiver under this paragraph if 
the Administrator determines that granting 
the waiver would undermine the credibility 
of the Women’s Business Center Program. 
‘‘(7) EXCESS
NON-FEDERAL
DOLLARS.—The 
amount of non-Federal dollars obtained by 
an eligible entity that is greater than the 
amount that is required to be obtained by 
the eligible entity under this subsection 
shall not be subject to the requirements of 
part 200 of title 2, Code of Federal Regula-
tions, or any successor thereto, if such 
amount of non-Federal dollars— 
‘‘(A) is not used as matching funds for pur-
poses of implementing the Women’s Business 
Center Program; and 
‘‘(B) was not obtained by using funds 
granted under the Women’s Business Center 
Program. 
‘‘(8) CARRYOVER.—An eligible entity may 
use excess non-Federal dollars described in 
paragraph (7) to satisfy the matching funds 
requirement under paragraph (1) for the sub-
sequent 1-year grant term, if applicable, ex-
cept that such amounts shall be subject to 
the requirements of part 200 of title 2, Code

ployee of the Administration, in order to en-
sure that the applicant has sufficient re-
sources to provide the services for which the 
grant is being provided. 
‘‘(B) ANNUAL REVIEW.—An employee of the 
Administration shall— 
‘‘(i) conduct an annual programmatic and 
financial examination of each eligible entity, 
as described in subsection (g); and 
‘‘(ii) provide the results of such examina-
tion to the eligible entity. 
‘‘(3) REMEDIATION OF PROBLEMS.— 
‘‘(A) PLAN OF ACTION.—If an examination of 
an eligible entity conducted under paragraph 
(2)(B) identifies any problems, the eligible 
entity shall, within 45 calendar days of re-
ceiving a copy of the results of such exam-
ination, provide the Assistant Administrator 
with a plan of action, including specific 
milestones, for correcting such problems.

ANT ADMINISTRATOR.—The Assistant Admin-
istrator shall review each plan of action sub-
mitted under subparagraph (A) within 30 cal-

LUETKEMEYER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6441, the Women’s Business 
Center Improvement Act of 2022. This 
bill will modernize and strengthen the 
Small Business Administration’s Wom-
en’s Business Center program to better 
serve America’s women entrepreneurs 
and women-owned small businesses. 
I thank Ms. DAVIDS and Ms. TENNEY 
for their meaningful work to ensure 
women entrepreneurs across the coun-
try have continued access to vital 
counseling and training. 
WBCs are a critic component of 
SBA’s Resource Partner ecosystem, as-
sisting women in communities across 
the country, particularly those that 
are socially and economically dis-
advantaged. 
The WBC program forms more than 
130 centers nationwide and offers a full 
range of counseling and training serv-
ices for all stages of business develop-
ment. Many of the WBCs provide mul-
tilingual services, maintain evening 
and weekend hours to accommodate 
clients who work full time, and provide 
childcare. 
In fiscal year 2020, with the addi-
tional funding provided by the CARES 
Act, the WBC program increased their 
reach by 22 percent and trained and ad-
vised more than 82,000 clients, helping 
them create nearly 30,000 small busi-
nesses. 
As we all know, women were particu-
larly 
hard-hit 
by 
the 
pandemic. 
Women-owned 
businesses 
closed 
at 
higher rates than their male counter-
parts as women disproportionately left 
the workforce to be the primary care-
givers for their families. 
That is why I am pleased to support 
the Women’s Business Centers Im-
provement Act of 2022, which increases 
the program’s annual authorization 
level and increases the cap on indi-
vidual center grants. By doing so, more 
established centers can expand their 
reach to greater numbers of women. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bipartisan bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I rise in support of H.R. 6441, 
the Women’s Business Centers Im-
provement Act of 2022. 
Women’s Business Centers, WBCs, 
support over 150,000 women entre-
preneurs each year through training, 
mentoring, business development, and 
financing opportunities. This legisla-
tion, H.R. 6441, will bring increased 
oversight to the WBC program and long 
overdue modernizations. 
This legislation improves collabora-
tion with the SBA’s Office of Women’s 
Business Ownership and requires the 
SBA to provide an annual report to 
Congress to measure the effectiveness 
of the WBC program. 
We have found that we have got some 
problems with some of the WBC offices, 
and this legislation will help weed out 
the bad actors by requiring SBA to de-
velop policies and procedures to reduce 
the possibility of awarding grants to a 
WBC that will likely not remain in 
compliance with the program. 
This important legislation will not 
only ensure the integrity of the WBC 
program, but also support female en-
trepreneurs in their business ventures.

Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Ms. DAVIDS and Ms. TENNEY for 
working in a bipartisan manner to en-
sure this bill reached the House floor. I 
thank the chair for advancing this bill. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6441, which was unani-
mously reported out of our committee 
and has previously passed the House 
floor in a similar form. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS), the chair of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Economic 
Growth, Tax, and Capital Access. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and 
our ranking member for all the work 
they are doing on the House Com-
mittee on Small Business. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
stand up for the small business owners 
in their community and vote for my 
bill to support the Women’s Business 
Centers. 
Women are the engine of our econ-
omy. Women-owned businesses employ 
9.4 million people nationwide, contrib-
uting $1.2 trillion to our economy each 
year. When we invest in the success of 
women, we are giving our entire econ-
omy a boost. 
Women’s Business Centers are an ef-
fective resource that reach more than 
88,000 entrepreneurs each year through 
training, mentorship, and counseling. 
In 2020 alone, the WBC program in-
creased its outreach by 22 percent and 
helped start and sustain more than 
30,000 small businesses. 
To put it clearly, during the pan-
demic, they increased their outreach. 
That is a solid record of success made 
even more impressive by the commit-
ment to stepping up when they were 
needed the most. 
I have visited with the local Kansas 
City Women’s Business Center in Over-
land Park. They serve the Kansas City 
metro area and the entire State of 
Kansas. I have also spoken with women 
who have used their services, folks like 
Lenora, who started Technology Group 
Solutions 15 years ago with the help of 
the Kansas City Women’s Business 
Center. She now oversees more than 80 
employees in three States. 
She told me that she hears from 
women who don’t have the network or 
access to capital that they need to get 
their businesses off the ground. She 
sends them to the WBC because when 
Lenora first started her business, the 
center helped fill those gaps, paving 
the way for her to grow what is now a 
multimillion-dollar company. 
Other women I have spoken with spe-
cifically cite the WBC’s evening and 
weekend hours and that they offer 
childcare during training sessions. It is 
those tailored services that have made 
these centers such a crucial contrib-
utor 
to 
the 
success 
of 
so 
many 
businessowners. 
My bill, which we are voting on 
today, will enhance the WBC program 
to ensure that women entrepreneurs all 
across the country have access to coun-
seling and training services. I have 
seen it in action, and it is why I intro-
duced and strongly support this bipar-
tisan piece of legislation. 
It would raise the cap on grants for 
the first time since the program began 
and create an accreditation system to 
help establish standards of excellence, 
ensuring that our funds are being spent 
wisely to help growing entrepreneurs. 
The Kansas City Women’s Business 
Center served more than 800 clients 
last year. How many more businesses 
could they grow? How many more as-
piring entrepreneurs could they reach 
with more resources? 
I am proud to have introduced this 
important piece of legislation along-
side Congresswoman TENNEY, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY), a strong advocate for small 
businesses and the ranking member of 
the Small Business Subcommittee for 
Underserved, Agricultural, and Rural 
Business Development. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 6441, 
the Women’s Business Centers Im-
provement Act, legislation that I am 
honored to lead with my colleague, 
Representative SHARICE DAVIDS. 
Female entrepreneurs and women- 
owned businesses play a critical role in 
our Nation’s economy. As a longtime 
small business owner myself, and the 
owner of a woman-owned business, I 
understand 
the 
challenges 
women- 
owned small businesses face, especially 
in rural communities. 
The Women’s Business Center pro-
gram at the Small Business Adminis-
tration has been helping women over-
come obstacles and build thriving busi-
nesses for over 30 years. With more 
than 150 locations across the Nation, 
the Women’s Business Center program 
provides over 150,000 female small busi-
ness owners annually with resources

and guidance, helping them to identify 
opportunities for growth. 
The bipartisan Women’s Business 
Centers 
Improvement 
Act 
will 
strengthen the Women’s Business Cen-
ter program, increase authorized fund-
ing, and enact commonsense taxpayer 
protections and oversight provisions to 
safeguard public dollars and ensure 
that the program efficiently serves the 
American people. 
Additionally, the bill will expand the 
cap on grants made available under 
this program, which will better support 
our women entrepreneurs. These im-
provements will help the Women’s 
Business Centers program run effi-
ciently and expand into more commu-
nities, like those underserved commu-
nities particularly in my district and 
Ms. DAVIDS’ district and all across New 
York and our Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan women-owned small busi-
nesses bill and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6441. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN). 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Women’s Busi-
ness Centers Improvement Act, and I 
thank 
Representatives 
DAVIDS
and 
TENNEY for their work on this very im-
portant and bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. 
As our small business owners con-
tinue to recover from the pandemic, 
Congress must do everything it can to 
ensure access to quality entrepre-
neurial development resources. 
Underscoring the need for this bill, a 
recent study in partnership with the 
Association of Women’s Business Cen-
ters found that profits for female busi-
ness owners dropped by 26 percent from 
2020 to 2021, with average profits of 
about $47,000 less than male-owned 
firms. 
The economic pressures of the pan-
demic have hit women-owned busi-
nesses particularly hard, including in-
creasing operating expenses due to sup-
ply chain disruptions and rising costs. 
As an entrepreneur myself, I recog-
nize the challenges women business 
leaders face every day and especially in 
this moment. It is why I stand before 
you to talk about the importance of 
passing the Women’s Business Centers 
Improvement Act. 
This legislation will make needed im-
provements to the Small Business Ad-
ministration’s 
successful 
Women’s 
Business Center program. The bill will 
also strengthen the Office of Women’s 
Business Ownership and will improve 
coordination between the Association 
of Women’s Business Centers and the 
SBA. 
Furthermore, this legislation allows 
Congress to increase funding for Wom-
en’s Business Center programs, which I 
have been proud to advocate for with 
my colleague, Representative MARIE 
NEWMAN. 
With these additional resources, the 
SBA will be able to advise and train 
more women entrepreneurs. I have seen 
the demand for such programs right in 
my community of Chester and Berks 
Counties. 
In fact, this bipartisan effort is espe-
cially impactful for our Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, which has one 
of the highest numbers of women- 
owned businesses in the Nation. The 
time is now to build on that success. 
I thank Small Business Committee 
Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER
again for helping to 
bring this important bill to a vote be-
fore the House today. I urge my col-
leagues to join me and vote ‘‘yes’’ 
today on this bipartisan bill to support 
our small business owners. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, 
the WBC program has delivered for 
women-owned 
small 
businesses 
for 
many years. This legislation reauthor-
izes the program, increases account-
ability and oversight, and ensures the 
program continues to serve our entre-
preneurs in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
6441, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Women are vital members of the Na-
tion’s critical small business commu-
nity and the American economy. H.R. 
6441 will modernize and strengthen 
SBA’s WBC program so it can meet the 
moment and provide the necessary re-
sources to women, particularly the 
ones driven out of the workforce during 
the pandemic. 
Not only have Ms. DAVIDS and Ms. 
TENNEY continued to work to improve 
the WBC program, but they have ex-
panded upon our efforts last Congress 
by addressing the challenges high-
lighted during the public health emer-
gency. I thank them for this effort. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6441. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6450, the SCORE for Small Busi-
ness Act of 2022. 
America’s nearly 30 million small 
businesses represent more than 99 per-
cent of all businesses. Since its incep-
tion, the SBA has undertaken efforts 
to connect new entrepreneurs and 
small business owners with more expe-
rienced businessmen and -women. 
SCORE, one component of SBA’s re-
source partner ecosystem, is uniquely 
situated to make these connections. 
SCORE’S expansive network consists 
of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and 
executives who volunteer as mentors to 
small businesses and entrepreneurs, 
both in person and online. 
SCORE volunteers provide personal-
ized advice and pull from their personal 
business experience to help the next 
generation of business leaders. Pro-
viding consultation on topics such as 
business plan development, strategic 
marketing, and financing ideas, SCORE 
ensures their clients receive com-
prehensive 
counseling 
and 
training 
while 
meeting 
their 
individualized 
needs. 
In 2020, through SCORE’S network of 
over 250 chapters and 10,000 volunteers, 
the program helped create over 45,000 
new businesses and over 74,000 new 
jobs. In addition, SCORE had a return 
on Federal investment of over $67 for 
every $1 of Federal appropriations. 
Increasing funding for SCORE is im-
portant to its continued success, and I 
am pleased that H.R. 6450 increases its 
authorization to $13.5 million for 2 fis-
cal years. 
H.R. 6450 not only reauthorizes this 
essential program but also takes nec-
essary steps to restore integrity, ac-
counting, and performance to the pro-
gram. 
The measures in the bill to expand 
and promote client and volunteer di-
versity will ensure SCORE can reach 
all of America’s small business owners 
and entrepreneurs, no matter their 
background or location. 
I commend Representatives YOUNG 
KIM and ANGIE CRAIG for working to-
gether to make sure that the SCORE 
program is strengthened while main-
taining efficient and effective oper-
ations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support today of H.R. 6450, 
the SCORE for Small Business Act. 
SCORE is the largest network of free 
private-sector volunteer mentors. They 
provide entrepreneurs with trainings 
on starting a business; succession plan-
ning; and management, finance, and 
marketing tools. 
SCORE mentors have helped small 
businesses pivot their business model 
during the pandemic. They have shared 
marketing and data analytics expertise 
to help entrepreneurs grow their cus-
tomer base and counseled numerous 
startups on the first steps to begin a 
business. 
In addition to reauthorizing the pro-
gram, H.R. 6450 takes important strides 
to add new program safeguards, data 
standards, and reporting requirements. 
I am confident the provisions of this 
bill will support small business, im-
prove SBA’s and Congress’ oversight of 
the SCORE program, and ensure that 
the integrity of the SCORE Association 
is restored and maintained. 
Congresswoman KIM is a great advo-
cate for small businesses and their re-
source partners, and I appreciate her 
work on this legislation. I also thank 
Ms. CRAIG and the chair for advancing 
this legislation. 
H.R. 6450 was favorably reported out 
of the Committee on Small Business 
unanimously and passed the House last 
Congress in a similar form. I urge my 
colleagues to similarly pass the bill 
today on the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM), the ranking member on the 
Small Business Subcommittee of Inno-
vation, Entrepreneurship, and Work-
force Development; a small business 
owner herself; and a great advocate for 
small businesses.

Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Mr. LUETKEMEYER and Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ for their leadership 
on the Small Business Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of my legislation, H.R. 6450, the SCORE 
for Small Business Act of 2022. This bi-
partisan bill reauthorizes the SCORE 
program for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, 
and it will allow SCORE to expand 
counseling and training through online

webinars, electronic mentoring plat-
forms, and online toolkits to better 
serve 
small 
businesses 
and 
entre-
preneurs across U.S. communities, in-
cluding the rural and underserved 
areas. 
Additionally, this bill would better 
protect 
taxpayers’ 
dollars 
through 
oversight 
mechanisms. 
Since 
1964, 
SCORE has helped over 11 million en-
trepreneurs to establish, expand, or 
service a small business. Since the 
COVID–19 pandemic began early 2020, 
SCORE has seen a 30 percent increase 
in demand for their services. Despite 
challenges faced, 89 percent of SCORE 
clients stayed in business throughout 
2020. 
In 2021, the SCORE chapter in Orange 
County in my district helped start 269 
new small businesses and create nearly 
4,000 jobs. In 2019, prior to the pan-
demic, Orange County SCORE deliv-
ered 11,154 total services. In 2021, they 
delivered 25,146 total services. This is a 
125 percent increase and over double 
the rate of pre-pandemic levels. 
Thanks to the volunteers and men-
tors in SCORE, countless small busi-
nesses in my district have been able to 
keep their businesses running and keep 
their employees on their payroll. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative CRAIG, for her partner-
ship on this. I urge all my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6450 and allow 
SCORE to continue this public-private 
partnership to support small businesses 
across the country. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, small businesses con-
sistently highlight the importance of 
resources to grow their business and 
serve their communities. 
The private sector driven SCORE 
mentorship program is an important 
tool for small businesses seeking as-
sistance and guidance during these 
challenging economic times. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6450, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the SCORE program has 
made good progress improving the 
transparency, accountability, and effi-
cacy of their organization. Today’s leg-
islation builds upon that progress so 
that a critical program can succeed 
well into the future. 
SCORE is unique among SBA’s re-
source partners in that they connect 
clients directly with successful busi-
ness mentors who have firsthand expe-
rience and knowledge to help them 
with their unique situations. 
H.R. 6450 will expand SCORE’s ability 
to reach more small business owners 
and entrepreneurs, particularly those 
in underserved and rural communities 
while maintaining the program im-
provements SCORE has worked hard to 
develop. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their bipartisan support of the 
SCORE program. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6450. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ONE STOP SHOP FOR SMALL BUSI-
NESS COMPLIANCE ACT OF 2021 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4877) to amend the Small 
Business Act to require the Small Busi-
ness and Agriculture Regulatory En-
forcement Ombudsman to create a cen-
tralized website for compliance guides, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4877 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘One Stop 
Shop for Small Business Compliance Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. CENTRALIZED WEBSITE FOR COMPLI-
ANCE GUIDES. 
Section 30 of the Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 657) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsections: 
‘‘(e) CENTRALIZED WEBSITE.—Not later than 
6 months after the date of the enactment of 
this subsection, the Ombudsman shall main-
tain a publicly available website that in-
cludes— 
‘‘(1) hyperlinks to small entity compliance 
guides described under section 212(a)(1) of 
the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996; and 
‘‘(2) with respect to each such small entity 
compliance guide, the contact information 
for an individual who can offer assistance to 
small entities with respect to the rules that 
are the subject of such guide. 
‘‘(f) REPORT ON AGENCY COMPLIANCE.—The 
Ombudsman shall include in the annual re-
port required under subsection (b)(2)(C) an 
assessment of agency compliance with the 
requirements of section 212 of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act of 1996 for the year covered by such an-
nual report.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop for 
Small Business Compliance Act of 2021, 
which will require SBA’s Office of the 
National Ombudsman to maintain a 
centralized website for regulatory com-
pliance guides. 
Federal agencies are required by the 
Small Business Regulatory Enforce-
ment Fairness Act to publish small en-
tity compliance guides for each rule re-
quiring a regulatory flexibility anal-
ysis. 
These compliance guides are meant 
to explain Federal rules in easy-to-un-
derstand terms for small businesses 
and help them comply with Federal 
regulations that protect our environ-
ment, health, and consumer safety. 
However, small businesses do not al-
ways have the resources to navigate 
multiple agencies’ websites to find 
these guides. 
H.R. 4877 will ensure the Office of the 
National Ombudsman maintains an up-
dated centralized website containing 
links to each agency’s small business 
compliance guides and their relevant 
points of contact. 
This simple step will significantly re-
duce the administrative burden on en-
trepreneurs, make compliance easier, 
and allow them to spend more time 
doing what they do best—running their 
businesses and creating jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
DELGADO and VAN DUYNE for working 
in a bipartisan manner to advance this 
bill to assist small businesses across 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4877, the One Stop Shop for Small Busi-
ness Compliance Act of 2021. 
Federal agencies are required to pub-
lish small business compliance guides 
for 
certain 
regulations. 
Presently, 
these guides are housed in different 
agency websites making it difficult for 
small businesses to find and utilize. 
This bipartisan legislation will cre-
ate a one-stop-shop that will make it 
easier for small businesses to comply 
with Federal regulations. This bill will 
also require the centralized website to 
list contact information for the appro-
priate agency staff who could provide 
regulatory assistance to small busi-
nesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO) 
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
VAN DUYNE) for working in tandem to 
bring this issue to the forefront. 
H.R. 4877 passed out of committee by 
a voice vote and similar language 
passed the House floor in the 116th 
Congress. I encourage all Members to 
support this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4474 
April 26, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. DELGADO). 
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, we all 
know that the past couple of years 
have been difficult on small businesses. 
COVID–19 upended life as we knew it. 
While America is turning a corner from 
the perspective of public health, the 
pandemic’s aftershocks are still raising 
costs, scrambling supply chains, and 
disrupting labor markets. 
That is what I heard from folks in 
Cooperstown last month when I invited 
the SBA administrator to tour Main 
Street with me. That is what I heard a 
few days ago when I visited small busi-
nesses in Tannersville in Greene Coun-
ty. That is what I regularly hear from 
small businessowners at my townhall 
meetings across the district. That is 
why Congress should be doing every-
thing it can to reduce burdens on small 
business owners. That is what my bi-
partisan bill, the One Stop Shop for 
Small Business Compliance Act, would 
do. 
In 1996, Congress passed a law requir-
ing Federal agencies to publish easy- 
to-use regulation compliance guides for 
small businesses; a good idea that was 
poorly implemented. 
The problem is, these guides are 
housed on different agency websites, 
making it difficult for small businesses 
to find and utilize them. If you want to 
find something for OSHA, you have to 
go to the OSHA website. If you want to 
find FTC’s compliance guide, you go 
look around at FTC.gov. These guides 
are scattered across countless govern-
ment websites. 
My bill is simple, it would require 
the Small Business Administrator’s Of-
fice of the National Ombudsman to cre-
ate a centralized website that houses 
all Federal agency compliance guides 
in one place. 
By creating a one-stop-shop online, 
we make these guides more accessible 
for small business owners who often 
lack the resources to hire staff to focus 
on compliance issues. The platform 
would also list contact information for 
the appropriate agency staff who could 
provide regulatory assistance to small 
businesses. 
Small businesses are essential ele-
ments of the economic and social fab-
ric of upstate New York. I am proud to 
cosponsor this legislation which will 
make it easier, not harder, for folks 
back home to run their businesses and 
access resources from the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
BETH VAN DUYNE for her partnership on 
this bipartisan, commonsense legisla-
tion. I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ 
and Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER for 
their support, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, 
in closing, having the rules of the road 
clearly and succinctly in one location 
for all small business owners is instru-
mental. The One Stop Shop for Small 
Business Compliance Act of 2021 will 
ensure this occurs at the SBA. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for 
advancing this legislation that better 
informs the Nation’s small businesses, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in 
closing, small employers have experi-
enced great hardships throughout the 
pandemic, but today we have the op-
portunity to make it easier, not hard-
er, to comply with Federal regulations. 
The ombudsman’s centralized website 
will streamline the compliance process 
for small businesses and ensure they 
have the most accurate and updated in-
formation. 
I thank the committee members for 
their diligence in advancing this piece 
of legislation. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4877. 
The question was taken; and (two-

SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY 
IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6454) to clarify the primary 
functions and duties of the Office of 
Advocacy of the Small Business Ad-
ministration, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6454 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Busi-
ness Advocacy Improvements Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS 
AND DUTIES OF THE OFFICE OF AD-
VOCACY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
(a) PRIMARY
FUNCTIONS.—Section 202 of 
Public Law 94–305 (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amend-
ed— 
(1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ‘‘and the 
international economy’’ after ‘‘economy’’; 
(2) in paragraph (9), by striking ‘‘com-
plete’’ and inserting ‘‘compete’’; and 
(3) in paragraph (12), by striking ‘‘serviced- 
disabled’’ and inserting ‘‘service-disabled’’. 
(b) DUTIES.—Section 203(a) of Public Law 
94–305 (15 U.S.C. 634c) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (5), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period 
at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(7) represent the views and interests of 
small businesses before foreign governments 
and international entities for the purpose of 
contributing to regulatory and trade initia-
tives which may affect small businesses.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6454, the Small Business Advo-
cacy Improvements Act of 2022. 
Established in 1976, SBA’s Office of 
Advocacy is the independent voice for 
small businesses within the Federal 
Government. The office oversees the 
enforcement of the Regulatory Flexi-
bility Act and is a source for statistics 
and research on matters pertaining to 
small businesses. Over the years, the 
Office of Advocacy’s responsibilities 
have expanded, and participation in 
international regulatory cooperation 
and trade initiatives that impact small 
businesses is becoming increasingly 
important. 
H.R. 6454 makes it clear that the Of-
fice of Advocacy has the authority to 
examine international economic data 
and represent small businesses in inter-
national discussions, particularly in 
trade negotiations. 
I thank the ranking member and Mr. 
CARTER for their bipartisan work on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6454, the Small Business Advocacy Im-
provements Act of 2022. 
The Nation’s regulatory environment 
directly impacts small businesses and 
America’s entrepreneurs. With limited 
resources and staff, small business 
owners are often wearing many hats 
throughout the entire workday, includ-
ing ensuring compliance with all Fed-
eral regulations. Now more than ever, 
small businesses, entrepreneurs, and 
startups need a strong advocate in 
Washington supporting them when it 
comes to regulations. 
My bill, which was favorably re-
ported out of committee by a voice 
vote, will improve and enhance the Of-
fice of Advocacy. H.R. 6454 will ensure 
the office is able to speak on inter-
national and trade matters. 
In addition to passing out of com-
mittee earlier this year, this legisla-
tion also passed the House floor by 
voice vote in the 116th Congress. Con-
gress has the ability to structurally en-
hance an executive branch office that

CARTER
from 
Louisiana, 
for 
working with me in a bipartisan man-
ner to improve the SBA’s Office of Ad-
vocacy. I also thank the chair for help-

Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ‘‘yes’’

small businesses first. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, 
the Nation is getting ready to cele-
brate National Small Business Week. 
This will be a time to honor and recog-
nize Main Street USA. Additionally, it 
will be a time to hear from them about 
what is impacting their operations and 
what Congress can do to further sup-
port them. 
The five small business bills before us 
today take steps to enhance and sup-
port programs at the Small Business 
Administration, which is the sole Fed-
eral agency that was created to assist 
the Nation’s smallest firms. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for 
working in a bipartisan manner to ad-
vance all these bills. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on all of them, including H.R. 
6454, and I yield back balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, SBA’s Office of Advo-
cacy works to ensure that small busi-
ness interests are heard at all levels of 
government because, too often, their 
voices are drowned out by larger com-
panies with sophisticated legal depart-
ments and armies of lobbyists. 
Now as the world becomes more and 
more connected, participating in the 
global economy is vital to small busi-
nesses’ success. In order to do that, 
they need a strong voice advocating on 
their behalf. H.R. 6454 will allow the of-
fice to advocate on behalf of small 
businesses in international discussions, 
trade negotiations, and examine inter-
national economic data. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6454. 
The question was taken; and (two-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
270, the Brown v. Board of Education 
National Historic Site Expansion Act. 
This bipartisan bill would rename the 
Brown v. Board of Education National 
Historic Site in the State of Kansas as 
the Brown v. Board of Education Na-
tional Historic Park. 
It would also expand the park to in-
clude four affiliated sites in South 
Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and the 
District of Columbia relating to court 
cases on school desegregation that 
were consolidated into the Supreme 
Court case of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation of Topeka, an acknowledgment 
that I think is important of the entire 
list of plaintiffs in that historic court 
decision. 
This legislative effort will continue 
to elevate the important stories and 
education of the civil rights movement 
through these affiliated sites and na-
tional historic park designation. 
This bipartisan bill passed the Senate 
with an amendment by voice vote in 
April. The House companion legislation 
is sponsored by our colleague from 
South Carolina, the majority whip, 
Representative JAMES CLYBURN. 
Earlier this Congress, the House Nat-
ural Resources Committee held a hear-
ing on his bill and ordered it favorably 
reported by unanimous consent. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CLYBURN for championing this bill, and 
I urge my colleagues to support its 
adoption. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge that last 
week we celebrated National Park 
Week. Each April we celebrate our na-
tional parks and invite every American

to get out and actually experience 
them. 
My home State of Oregon harbors 
five units of the National Park System: 
Crater Lake National Park, Fort Van-
couver National Historic Site, the John 
Day Fossil Beds National Monument, 
Nez Perce National Historical Park, 
and Oregon Caves National Monument 
and Preserve. I look forward to at least 
the next century of visitors discovering 
Oregon’s parks and everything Oregon 
has to offer. 
In recent years the National Park 
Service has made a concerted effort to 
provide a more inclusive look at Amer-
ican history to ensure that our parks 
tell the stories of all Americans. I ap-
plaud the National Park Service for its 
effort to make all Americans feel wel-
come and included in our National 
Park System. 
S. 270, the Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation Historic Site Expansion Act, 
adds to the Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation National Historic Site currently 
located in Topeka, Kansas, so that it 
would include additional sites in South 
Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and the 
District of Columbia each as an affili-
ated area. 
This bill will help to recognize and 
preserve sites associated with the 
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka 
case, which resulted in a landmark Su-
preme Court ruling that racial segrega-
tion of public schools is unconstitu-
tional. We owe a huge debt of gratitude 
to the students, parents, and lawyers 
whose extraordinary courage and vi-
sion led to the dismantling of the sepa-
rate but equal doctrine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 
270, and I look forward to its being 
signed into law. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN.) 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me this 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 270, the Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation National Historic Site Expan-
sion Act. I thank Senator CHRIS COONS 
for his leadership securing the Senate’s 
unanimous support for passage of this 
important 
legislation 
earlier 
this 
month. I am proud to lead the legisla-
tion here in the House along with our 
bipartisan cosponsors, Congresswoman 
LISA
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, 
Congress-
woman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, and 
Congressman BOB GOOD. 
As a former teacher of history and a 
student of history, I believe in the 
value of learning from our past. Many 
Americans don’t know that the land-
mark Brown v. Board of Education Su-
preme 
Court 
decision, 
that 
deseg-
regated public schools in 1954, com-
bined legal challenges from four States 
and the District of Columbia. I rep-
resent one of those States and was for-
tunate to know some of the petitioners 
from Clarendon County, South Caro-
lina, who challenged the separate but 
equal laws. Many of their photographs 
hang in my congressional office. 
In 2004, I wrote, in cooperation with 
the Palmetto Conservation Founda-
tion, the book ‘‘Uncommon Courage: 
The Story of Briggs v. Elliott, South 
Carolina’s Unsung Civil Rights Bat-
tle.’’ That same year, I was proud to 
lead the effort to present the Congres-
sional Gold Medal of Honor to the lead-
ers of that challenge—Harry and Eliza 
Briggs, Levi Pearson, and Reverend Jo-
seph A. DeLaine. 
Their case, Briggs v. Elliott, was the 
first of those cases that later became 
Brown v. Board. The subsequent cases 
were in Delaware, Virginia, Wash-
ington, D.C., and, of course, Topeka, 
Kansas. 
Today there is a National Parks site 
that was created by Congress in 1992 in 
Topeka that tells the story of the ordi-
nary people who took this extraor-
dinary action to ensure their children 
had equal educational opportunities. 
However, the other communities in-
volved in this historic effort have no 
National Park Service presence ac-
knowledging their contributions. 
This 
legislation 
will 
right 
that 
wrong. It expands the Brown v. Board 
of Education National Historic Site to 
include locations in each of the com-
munities that were part of the lawsuit. 
When writing this legislation, I worked 
with the National Trust Fund for His-
toric Preservation who engaged with 
the communities that would be im-
pacted to solicit their input. 
b 1515 
With the enactment of this legisla-
tion, the Brown v. Board of Education 
National Historic Site will become 
more than the Monroe School building 
in Topeka. It will add the Summerton 
School and Scott’s Branch School in 
Summerton, South Carolina, to rep-
resent the Briggs v. Elliott case; the 
Hockessin Colored School No. 107 and 
Howard High School in Wilmington, 
Delaware, 
to 
represent 
Belton 
v. 
Gebhart; the former Robert Russa 
Moton High School, now a museum, in 
Farmville, Virginia, to represent Davis 
v. County School Board of Prince Ed-
ward County; and the John Philip 
Sousa Junior High School in the Dis-
trict of Columbia to represent Boiling 
v. Sharpe. 
Each of these sites will tell the story 
of how these communities fought to 
overturn the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson 
decision that established the separate 
but equal doctrine. When Brown v. 
Board of Education overturned that de-
cision and ended generations of inad-
equate education for Black children, 
constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak 
hailed it as ‘‘probably the most impor-
tant American Government act of any 
kind since the Emancipation Procla-
mation.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of 
this august body to follow the Senate’s 
lead and vote in favor of expanding the 
Brown v. Board of Education National 
Historic Site to ensure that all the 
communities that contributed to this 
landmark decision receive proper rec-
ognition. 
Having geographically dispersed his-
toric sites that tell this great story 
will enable more students to learn from 
the past and understand the impor-
tance of making America’s greatness 
accessible and affordable to all. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge sup-
port of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, let me 
thank Representative CLYBURN for his 
comments and for reaffirming that our 
national identity is driven by our his-
tory and that history is something that 
all of us need to learn. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 270. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HIGHLANDS CONSERVATION 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2793) to reauthorize the High-
lands Conservation Act, to authorize 
States to use funds from that Act for 
administrative purposes, and for other 
purposes, as amended.

The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2793, the Highlands 
Conservation Reauthorization Act, is 
led by my colleague, Representative 
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY. The bill reau-
thorizes funding for the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest 
Service to protect and conserve the 
Highlands region. 
The beautiful Highlands region spans 
3.4 million acres across Connecticut, 
New Jersey, New York, and Pennsyl-
vania. 
This area has retained its splendor 
due in part to the passage of the High-
lands Conservation Act of 2004, which 
authorized the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice and the Forest Service to work 
with State and local governments and 
NGOs to conserve this ecosystem. 
Since 2004, $28 million in Federal 
funds, matched by $53 million in non- 
Federal funds, have permanently pro-
tected almost 13,000 acres of land. 
These lands protect clean, safe drink-
ing water; sustain healthy forests and 
wildlife populations; encourage produc-
tive agriculture; and provide quality 
recreation opportunities for the public. 
I commend my colleague for his lead-
ership on this bipartisan bill to reau-
thorize the Highlands Conservation Act 
and ensure the continued success of 
this program. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2793, a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Congressman SEAN PATRICK MALONEY 
of New York, to reauthorize the High-
lands Conservation Act. 
The stated purpose of the Highlands 
Conservation Act, which was signed 
into law in 2004, is ‘‘to recognize the 
importance of the water, forest, agri-
cultural, wildlife, recreational, and 
cultural resources of the Highlands re-
gion,’’ which, as was indicated, spans 
some 3.4 million acres across Con-
necticut, New York, New Jersey, and 
Pennsylvania, ‘‘and the national sig-
nificance of the Highlands region to 
the United States.’’ 
Under the current authorization, the 
Governors of these States identify con-
servation partnership projects in the 
region and submit a list annually to 
the Secretary of the Interior, who is 
tasked with working with the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to submit a final 
list to Congress for approval and fund-
ing. 
H.R. 2793 would reauthorize the High-
lands Conservation Act and allow mu-
nicipalities to enter into conservation 
agreements with the Department of the 
Interior. This bill is the product of bi-
partisan negotiations with the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. SEAN 
PATRICK MALONEY) and thank him for 
being the driving force in bringing this 
legislation to this point. 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend for all of his work. 
I rise, Mr. Speaker, to support my 
bill, the Highlands Conservation Reau-
thorization Act, which would extend 
the Highlands Conservation Program 
for an additional 7 years, through 2029. 
If you have hiked through any of the 
public lands in the Hudson Valley, 
chances are you have enjoyed the expe-
rience and benefited from the land con-
served and protected by the Highlands 
Conservation Program. Even if you 
have looked upon the extraordinary 
works of art in the Hudson River 
School of painting, the most famous 
American school of painting, you will 
see these lands in the Hudson High-
lands and wonder, as we who are lucky 
enough to live there do, at their beau-
ty. 
For nearly two decades, the High-
lands Conservation Act has been a crit-
ical resource for the protection of these 
lands throughout a 5,500-square-mile 
area of the Highlands region covering 
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
and Pennsylvania. 
It includes many of our great State 
parks in my district, including Har-
riman State Park, Bear Mountain 
State Park, Schunemunk Mountain 
State Park, Storm King State Park, 
Hudson Highlands State Park, and 
Clarence Fahnestock Memorial State 
Park, to name a few. 
The bill funds vital projects to safe-
guard our water supplies, conserve our 
forests, protect wildlife, expand out-
door public recreation opportunities, 
and save agricultural resources. 
Over the past 18 years, the Highlands 
Conservation Act has delivered on its 
promise. It facilitated the permanent 
protection of nearly 13,000 acres of 
land, land that contributes to clean 
drinking water, protection of wildlife, 
expansion of recreation opportunities, 
and, of course, the sustainable eco-
nomic growth that we all want. 
Since 2007, New York has received 
over $14 million through the Highlands 
Conservation Act, funding that sup-
ported 18 specific projects conserving 
4,000 acres throughout my district in 
the Hudson Valley. 
For example, in 2015, the act helped 
incorporate over 230 acres of land into 
the Clarence Fahnestock Memorial 
State Park in Putnam County, right 
down the street from where I live. I 
spend a lot of time there. It is abso-
lutely beautiful. 
In 2016, funds from the Highlands 
Conservation Act helped conserve near-
ly 700 acres of land linking the western

It is also responsible for the addition 
of 1,200 acres that make up the Fishkill 
Ridge portion of the Hudson Highlands 
State Park. 
More than 25 million Americans live 
within just an hour’s drive of the High-
lands region. By passing this bill 
today, we can ensure that the High-
lands are protected and remain a beau-
tiful natural resource for them and for 
our entire country for generations to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, the Highlands Con-
servation Program has been an ex-
tremely effective program not just for 
my district but for the entire region 
and our country. The entire conserva-
tion community should congratulate 
itself today. 
I want to mention a few local people: 
Mark 
Zakutansky with the Appa-
lachian Mountain Club; Ned Sullivan 
and Andy Bicking with Scenic Hudson; 
Katrina Shindledecker and Michelle 
Smith with the Hudson Highlands Land 
Trust; 
and 
Tim 
Abbott 
with 
the 
Housatonic Valley Association. I thank 
them all for their extraordinary work. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2793, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MENG. 
This legislation would establish a 
commission to study and report on the 
potential creation of a national mu-
seum of Asian Pacific American his-
tory and culture in the District of Co-
lumbia and its surrounding areas. 
The establishment of this commis-
sion is a first step in acknowledging 
the long history, role, and contribu-
tions of Asian Americans in American 
culture. 
I thank Representative MENG
for 
championing this piece of legislation. I 
urge my colleagues to support its adop-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, 
Washington, DC, March 30, 2022. 
Hon. RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 3525. There are certain 
provisions in the legislation which fall with-
in the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee 
on House Administration. 
In the interest of permitting your com-
mittee to proceed expeditiously to floor con-
sideration, the Committee on House Admin-
istration agrees to forego action on the bill. 
This is done with the understanding that the 
Committee on House Administration’s juris-
dictional interests over this and similar leg-
islation are in no way diminished or altered. 
In addition, the Committee reserves its right 
to seek conferees on any provisions within 
its jurisdiction which are considered in a 
House-Senate conference and requests your 
support if such a request is made. 
I would appreciate your response con-
firming this understanding with respect to 
H.R. 3525 and ask that a copy of our ex-
change of letters on this matter be included 
in your committee report on the bill and in 
the Congressional Record during consider-
ation of the bill on the House floor. 
Sincerely, 
ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Washington, DC, April 5, 2022. 
Hon. ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chair, Committee on House Administration, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR LOFGREN, I write to you con-
cerning H.R. 3525, the ‘‘Commission To 
Study the Potential Creation of a National 
Museum of Asian Pacific American History 
and Culture Act.’’ 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this legislation. I recognize that 
the bill contains provisions that fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Committee on House 
Administration. I acknowledge that your 
Committee will not formally consider H.R. 
3525 and agree that the inaction of your 
Committee with respect to the bill does not 
waive any future jurisdictional claim over 
the matters contained in the bill that fall 
within your Committee’s Rule X jurisdic-
tion. I am pleased to support your request to 
name members of the Committee on House 
Administration to any conference committee 
to consider such provisions. 
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is 
included in the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate 
your cooperation regarding this legislation 
and look forward to continuing to work with 
you as this measure moves through the legis-
lative process. 
Sincerely, 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.

Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3525, offered by Representative MENG, 
to authorize a commission to study the 
potential creation of a National Mu-
seum of Asian Pacific American His-
tory and Culture. 
My home State of Oregon has a proud 
and growing Asian-American and Pa-
cific-Islander population. Oregon is 
home to many cultural centers, muse-
ums, gardens, and historic sites related 
to Asian-American and Pacific-Islander 
heritage. 
This commission would be tasked 
with preparing a report for Congress 
and 
the 
President 
providing 
rec-
ommendations 
regarding 
the 
feasi-
bility of establishing and maintaining 
a National Museum of Asian Pacific 
American History and Culture in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
The commission would be required to 
consider several factors, including the 
availability and cost of the collections 
to be acquired, the cost of con-
structing, operating, and maintaining 
the museum, and the feasibility of the 
museum becoming part of the Smithso-
nian Institution. 
While I support this bill, I am con-
cerned about the significant financial 
and operational challenges that adding 
an additional national museum to the 
Smithsonian’s portfolio could pose. 
Just 2 years ago, Congress authorized 
the establishment of the National Mu-
seum of the American Latino and 
American Women’s History Museum. 
In addition to constructing two new 
museums, the Smithsonian is facing a 
facilities 
maintenance 
backlog 
ap-
proaching $1 billion; identified collec-
tion storage needs; a $900 million ren-
ovation of the National Air and Space 
Museum expected to conclude this 
year; and ongoing rehabilitation of 
other historic structures on the Na-
tional Mall. 
I appreciate Chair GRIJALVA’s will-
ingness to address Republican concerns 
about the Smithsonian’s capacity. At 
markup, an amendment was adopted to 
require the commission to consider the 
potential impact on the Smithsonian’s 
existing 
maintenance 
backlog 
and 
identified construction or renovation 
costs for new or existing museums. 
Additionally, I appreciate an amend-
ment adopted at markup to prohibit 
the use of Federal funds for the com-
mission. These are good governance 
amendments that will strengthen the 
commission’s work and eventual re-
port. 
I appreciate our friends on the other 
side of the aisle taking this bill 
through regular order and working 
with Republicans to address our con-
cerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
MENG), the sponsor of the legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4481 
April 26, 2022 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak in favor of H.R. 3525, a bill I 
authored to establish a commission to 
study the potential creation of a Na-
tional Museum of Asian Pacific Amer-
ican History and Culture. 
I want to first thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA
and 
Ranking 
Member 
WESTERMAN of the House Committee 
on Natural Resources, Congressman 
BENTZ, and Chairman NEGUSE
and 
Ranking Member FULCHER of the Sub-
committee on National Parks, Forests, 
and Public Lands for their work with 
me on bringing this bill to the floor. 
Second, I thank Speaker PELOSI, 
Leader HOYER, and Whip CLYBURN for 
their support on this historic legisla-
tion. I also acknowledge and thank 
Chairperson LOFGREN of the Committee 
on House Administration for her sup-
port in moving this bill forward. 
I first introduced this bill in the 
114th Congress, and during that Con-
gress, we witnessed the opening of the 
National Museum of African American 
History and Culture that our former 
colleague, the legendary John Lewis, 
spearheaded for decades. 
Since then, we have seen legislation 
establishing the National Museum of 
the American Latino and the Smithso-
nian American Women’s History Mu-
seum signed into law. 
Our communities and caucuses have 
stood together in each of these efforts, 
and it is a joy to see this AAPI mu-
seum study bill arrive at this point 
today. 
America is filled with diverse stories 
of achievement and moments of trag-
edy. Within our shared history, there 
are countless tales of Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders, or AAPIs, con-
tributing to every facet of our Nation. 
As far back as the 1700s, AAPIs have 
shaped American society. From the 
Chinese laborers who helped build the 
transcontinental railroad, a vital piece 
of U.S. infrastructure, to the thousands 
of AAPIs who fought for fair working 
conditions for agricultural workers 
during the Hawaii sugar strike of 1946, 
AAPIs have and continue to shape this 
Nation’s history. 
Yet, those contributions are often 
unheard of and simply forgotten. It is 
time to change that. A national mu-
seum dedicated to collecting, pre-
serving, and displaying these tales is 
long overdue. 
Museums provide a space to reflect 
on our past, assess our present, and 
dream of the future that we are work-
ing toward. 
My bill is one step closer to the cre-
ation of a national museum dedicated 
to our AAPI American history. The 
commission established through this 
legislation will be comprised of experts 
in their respective fields who will be 
responsible for studying the feasibility 
of creating a national museum and pro-
viding recommendations to Congress 
on whether to, and how to establish a 
national museum. 
Additionally, the commission will 
study logistical questions of exhibit 
curation, fundraising capacity, cost of 
creating and maintaining such an in-
stitution, and whether or not this mu-
seum should be part of the Smithso-
nian Institution. 
AAPIs are the fastest growing ethnic 
group in America, and the contribu-
tions of this community have shaped 
our Nation’s infrastructure, economy, 
culture, and so much more. We must 
never forget that AAPI history is also 
American history. 
Today’s consideration of H.R. 3525 is 
a necessary step to ensure the full face 
of American diversity across our entire 
country is displayed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3525, the 
Commission to Study the Potential 
Creation of a National Museum of 
Asian Pacific American History and 
Culture Act. 
The contributions of Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders to this great 
Nation have been enormous. The his-
tory of AAPIs is rich, but this history 
is rarely talked about, and the con-
tributions often go unknown or unrec-
ognized. I am often asked how someone 
can learn about AAPI history, and ad-
mittedly, I don’t know as much as I 
should. 
Now more than ever, with the rise in 
hate crimes like the Atlanta shootings 
and other acts of violence in New York 
City and throughout the country, we 
keep hearing this phrase, ‘‘You don’t 
belong here.’’ 
I have heard that throughout my life 
and, sadly, my two little boys, 4 years 
old and 6 years old, have already heard 
hurtful words that have labeled them 
in ways they don’t yet understand. 
Like many, I don’t want my kids to 
understand 
who 
they 
are 
through 
sources of hate and discrimination. I 
want them to feel pride, pride in who 
they are, pride in AAPIs, and pride in 
our place in this Nation. 
Our story is not just an Asian-Amer-
ican story. It is an American story. 
The history is not just an Asian-Amer-
ican history, it is American history, 
and this history isn’t just for AAPIs to 
learn, it is for all of us. Together, 
through learning, we can come to-
gether, creating greater understanding, 
a closer knit community, celebrating 
the richness of this Nation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3525 to com-
mission a study for the creation of a 
National Museum of Asian Pacific 
American History and Culture Act. 
Asian Americans have been contrib-
uting to the fabric of our United States 
of America from its earliest days, help-
ing to build, shape, and defend our 
great country. 
This long-overdue museum will serve 
as a gateway for everyone to see, feel, 
and understand the countless true sto-
ries of Asian Americans, stories of per-
severance, dedication, and beating the 
odds to achieve their dreams. Those 
from trailblazers like Larry Itliong, a 
Filipino-American labor leader who or-
ganized with Latino civil rights leaders 
like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. 
My father worked in the fields, and I 
remember when I was a little boy, he 
told me once, ‘‘When I worked in the 
fields, I wanted to work harder than 
everyone else. The people who always 
worked as hard as me and challenged 
me were my Filipino colleagues work-
ing in the fields.’’ I quoted him in 
English, although my father spoke to 
me in Spanish. 
Or 
people 
like 
Constance 
Wu, 
Awkwafina, and Ali Wong, whose con-
tributions to the arts have positively 
impacted millions of Americans. These 
stories and so many more deserve to be 
told and understood. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill. I can’t wait to see the day 
this museum is on The Mall with the 
National Museum of the American 
Latino, the American Women’s History 
Museum, the National Museum of Afri-
can American History and Culture, and 
the National Museum of the American 
Indian. 
I would also like to take a point of 
privilege to say thank you to GRACE 
MENG, who at one time was the only 
Asian-American legislator in the legis-
lature in New York. Not the first one, 
but she was there by herself, and she 
was a caucus of one, and she is now in 
the United States Congress, serving 
our 
community 
proudly 
and 
rep-
resenting her community proudly as 
well. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to say how important this bill is, in 
part because of the incredibly valuable 
folks we have in my part of my State, 
including the Kitamuras, the Nagakis, 
the Maedas, the Nambas, the Saitos, 
the Itos, the Tanakas, the Teramuras, 
and many others, all of whom are abso-
lutely wonderful parts of our commu-
nity. 
They are also incredibly conserv-
ative, and I am sure will be happy to 
see the portions of this bill that reflect 
the agreement to make sure that we 
are able to pay for whatever it is that 
we do. They are truly deserving of this 
recognition. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, this 
legislation is important. It comes at 
the right time. It is an affirmation of 
the inclusiveness, diversity, and the 
equal status of all of us as Americans. 
I am very proud to support this. I 
urge its adoption, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
H.R. 5973, the Great Lakes Fish and 
Wildlife Reauthorization Act, is spon-
sored by the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. DINGELL), my friend and col-
league from the Natural Resources 
Committee. 
b 1545 
This bill reauthorizes funding for the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to com-
bat pollution, invasive species, and 
habitat loss in the Great Lakes region. 
The Great Lakes Basin is the largest 
body of fresh water on the planet, hold-
ing 18 percent of the world’s freshwater 
supply. Some 35 million people across 8 
States and Canada depend on the basin 
for drinking water, jobs, and recre-
ation. 
The Great Lakes are also a habitat to 
more than 500 migratory bird species, 
more than 140 species of fish, and many 
endangered and threatened species. 
However, agricultural and industrial 
waste pose a threat to the water qual-
ity in the basin. There are extensive 
populations of harmful invasive spe-
cies. And wildlife species are at risk 
due to habitat loss. 
Fortunately, since 1990, the Fish and 
Wildlife Service has worked with local 
communities and NGOs to restore the 
Great Lakes Basin by tackling pollu-
tion, removing invasive species, and re-
storing essential habitats. 
Congress has reauthorized funding 
for 
this 
important 
program 
three 
times, and I urge them to do so again 
today so that the Fish and Wildlife 
Service can continue the excellent 
work that they are doing in protecting 
that extraordinary and necessary eco-
system. 
I commend my colleague, Represent-
ative DINGELL, for her work on this im-
portant bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5973, a bill sponsored by our colleague, 
Representative DEBBIE DINGELL from 
Michigan, to reauthorize the Great 
Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration 
Act. 
Under the authorities provided by 
this law, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service developed six common Great 
Lakes fish and wildlife restoration 
goals in collaboration with State and 
local partners. To date, 81 fish and 
wildlife restoration grant projects have 
been funded through this cooperative 
effort. 
This law has been reauthorized three 
times, most recently in 2016. The bill 
we are considering today would extend 
these authorities until 2027 without in-
creasing funding authorization. 
We appreciate Congresswoman DIN-
GELL’s commitment not to move this 
bill until the Fish and Wildlife Service 
provided a mandatory report to Con-
gress. In late March, we finally re-
ceived this report, which allowed us to 
evaluate the current program and its 
progress toward meeting its goals. 
I commend Congresswoman DINGELL 
for her leadership on this legislation, 
and I urge adoption of the measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his incredible sup-
port, and I thank my Republican col-
league for his kind words and how we 
work together. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restora-
tion Reauthorization Act. This bipar-
tisan legislation, which I am leading 
with my other colleagues, Congress-
man 
DARIN
LAHOOD, 
Congressman 
PAUL TONKO, and Congressman DAVID 
JOYCE, supports fish and wildlife con-
servation efforts in the Great Lakes. 
Since 1998, the Great Lakes Fish and 
Wildlife Restoration Act has provided 
critical resources for coordinating con-
servation efforts across the Great 
Lakes ecosystem. This longstanding bi-
partisan backing underscores the effi-
cacy of the proven conservation mecha-
nisms in this legislation, including col-
laborative, private-public partnerships 
that maximize the impact of Federal 
funding to make landscape-level im-
provements to our fish and wildlife 
habitats. 
A recently released report on the pro-
gram by the Department of the Inte-
rior, found that as a result of the fish 
and wildlife grant program authorized 
by the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife 
Restoration 
Act, 
that 
significant 
progress has been made in addressing 
the six Great Lakes’ restoration goals 
specified in the legislation. 
This includes control of sea lamprey 
populations across the Great Lakes, 
progress on the restoration of lake 
trout in Lake Huron leading to reduc-
ing stocking targets, and other species 
recovery efforts vital to sustaining the 
very unique ecosystem of the Great 
Lakes Basin. 
However, continued work is required 
to protect the Great Lakes for future 
generations given the environmental 
pressures that this region faces. 
To this end, the Great Lakes Fish 
and Wildlife Restoration Act would au-
thorize funding for the Great Lakes 
Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act for 5 
years, from fiscal years 2022 through 
2027, at the current funding levels. 
This legislation has broad bipartisan 
support, as well as the backing of a va-
riety of groups dedicated to safe-
guarding the Great Lakes, including 
Ducks Unlimited and the Great Lakes 
Fishery Commission. 
These Great Lakes are 90 percent of 
the freshwater in the United States. 
We must protect them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, which will ensure our Great 
Lakes are protected for many genera-
tions to come. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time

There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6023, the Multi-
national Species Conservation Funds 
Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act 
is led by my friend and colleague on 
the Committee on Natural Resources, 
Representative JIM COSTA. 
The Multinational Species Conserva-
tion Fund Semipostal Stamps are a 
unique way for Americans to con-
tribute 
to 
important 
conservation 
projects. Semipostal stamps are post-
age stamps sold at higher rates than 
standard stamps. When purchasing this 
type of stamp, Americans elect to con-
tribute the extra charge to a specific 
fund or cause—in this case, the con-
servation of threatened species world-
wide. 
African and Asian elephants, great 
apes, turtles, rhinos, and tigers are 
threatened from decades of habitat 
loss, poaching, pollution, and climate 
change. These stamps support efforts 
to tackle poaching, improve commu-
nity engagement and outreach, restore 
habitat, and raise public awareness 
about wildlife trafficking. In fact, be-
tween 2011 and 2017, these stamps 
raised almost $4 million for conserva-
tion projects. 
However, the U.S. Postal Service has 
had to stop selling them when the pro-
gram’s authorization ran out. Approxi-
mately 49 million stamps remained. 
Annual appropriations bills have been 
directing the Postal Service to con-
tinue selling the stamps but in a piece-
meal fashion. This bill would fix it 
once and for all. 
The bill directs the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice to sell all the rest of these stamps. 
In doing so, we can continue to support 
the ongoing conservation efforts for en-
dangered species around the world. 
Let me thank Representative COSTA 
for his work on the legislation, urge 
support for it, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4484 
April 26, 2022 
Representative JIM COSTA of California 
to reauthorize the Multinational Spe-
cies Conservation Funds Semipostal 
Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2013 and 
to require the U.S. Postal Service to 
sell all remaining Multinational Spe-
cies Conservation Fund Semipostal 
Stamps. 
The Multinational Species Conserva-
tion Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of 
2010 first directed the Postal Service to 
issue this stamp to support the U.S. 
Fish 
and 
Wildlife 
Service 
Multi-
national Species Conservation Fund, 
which provides grants, as previously 
outlined by the previous speaker. 
According to the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, stamp sales have raised more 
than $5.7 million for the fund as of 2019. 
The authorization for offering the 
stamp expired in 2017, at which point 
the Postal Service suspended the sale, 
despite having more than 49 million 
printed and unsold stamps on hand. 
H.R. 6023 would direct the Postal 
Service to sell the remainder of these 
stamps and report to Congress when all 
have been sold. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. COSTA 
for his leadership on this legislation. I 
urge adoption of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6023, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

NATIONAL LIBERTY MEMORIAL 
PRESERVATION ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6201) to extend the authority for 
the establishment of a commemorative 
work to honor enslaved and free Black 
persons who served in the American 
Revolution, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6201 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Liberty Memorial Preservation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTAB-
LISHMENT 
OF 
COMMEMORATIVE 
WORK. 
Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, 
United States Code, the authority provided 
by section 2860 of the Military Construction 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (divi-
sion B of Public Law 112–239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 
U.S.C. 8903 note) shall continue to apply 
through September 30, 2027. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6201, the National Liberty Memorial 
Preservation Act, introduced by my 
friend and colleague, Representative 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN. 
This legislation would extend the au-
thority for the establishment of a com-
memorative work to honor enslaved 
and free Black persons who served in 
the American Revolution. Extending 
this authorization would allow the con-
gressionally authorized National Mall 
Liberty Fund D.C. to continue fund-
raising and construction of this memo-
rial near the National Mall in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
WATSON COLEMAN for championing this 
bill. I urge my colleagues to support its 
adoption, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6201 offered by 
Representative 
WATSON
COLEMAN 
would extend the authorization for the 
establishment of a memorial to honor 
the approximately 5,000 enslaved and 
free Black Revolutionary War patriots 
who served as soldiers or provided ci-
vilian assistance during the American 
Revolution. 
In 2014, Congress authorized the Na-
tional Liberty Memorial to be estab-
lished in Area 1 in Washington, D.C., 
which is defined by the Commemora-
tive Works Act as a location just off 
the National Mall. 
Under the Commemorative Works 
Act, sponsoring organizations are pro-
vided a 7-year period to construct the 
memorial, which unfortunately has ex-
pired. 
The subject matter of this memorial 
is extremely important, and I support 
extending the authority for the Na-
tional Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to con-
tinue its valuable work to construct a 
lasting memorial in our Nation’s Cap-
ital to honor the brave enslaved and 
free Black Revolutionary War patriots 
that fought to secure American inde-
pendence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1600 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from New Jersey 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN), the sponsor of 
the legislation. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chair GRIJALVA for 
bringing my bipartisan, bicameral bill 
to the floor. And I thank my Repub-
lican colleagues for supporting the 
same. 
H.R. 6201, the National Liberty Me-
morial Preservation Act, would extend 
authorization of the National Liberty 
Memorial, a monument to honor the 
Black and Indigenous soldiers who 
risked everything in the name of the 
American experiment. 
If not for the sacrifices of Black and 
Indigenous soldiers, we may not be the 
independent Nation that we are today. 
By the time the Continental Army 
marched to victory in Yorktown, these 
soldiers made up a quarter of George 
Washington’s forces. 
I am willing to bet that many Ameri-
cans don’t know this because, until re-
cently, I certainly didn’t. That is be-
cause, at best, the teaching of the Rev-
olutionary War fails to highlight the 
contributions of soldiers of color and, 
at worst, it actively whitewashes them. 
To wipe these soldiers from the story 
of our independence is to falsify the 
historical record. In our current mo-
ment, where fundamental truths about 
our history are under attack, we must 
right this wrong. Black and Indigenous 
soldiers sacrificed too much to be 
erased from the narrative of our Na-
tion’s war for independence. I authored 
the National Liberty Memorial Preser-
vation Act on their behalf. 
I thank Congresswoman HINSON and 
Senators MURPHY
and GRASSLEY
for 
joining me in introducing this legisla-
tion. I also thank National Liberty Me-
morial Fund D.C. for agreeing to build 
the memorial. 
I hope that, in addition to educating 
the public and honoring soldiers of 
color, this memorial will illustrate the 
importance of teaching the complete, 
honest truth about our history. I hope 
that it allows Black children, like my 
granddaughter, to grow up in an Amer-
ica where the trials and tribulations 
and triumphs of their ancestors are 
recognized. By telling the full story of 
our past, we can pave the way for a 
more inclusive future. 
I am very proud to support and urge 
the passage of this bicameral and bi-
partisan legislation. And I do pray that 
my colleagues, Democratic and Repub-
lican alike, will vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Na-
tional Liberty Memorial Preservation 
Act. 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4486 
April 26, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6651, the Alas-
ka Salmon Research Task Force Act, 
establishes a task force of fisheries sci-
entists and Alaskan stakeholders to 
study, address, and prevent salmon 
fishery disasters in Alaska. 
Led by the late dean of the House, 
our colleague and friend, Representa-
tive Don Young, this bill is a perfect 
example of how he fought for what is 
best for Alaska. 
Salmon are a vital part of the Alas-
kan way of life. Their cultural, eco-
nomic, nutritional, and recreational 
impact cannot be overstated. But, over 
the past decade, there have been sev-
eral fishery disasters that have put 
those very salmon at risk. 
These financial, ecological, and cul-
tural strains have created an increas-
ingly dire situation for the Alaskan 
communities that rely on salmon, espe-
cially Native Alaskan communities. 
This bill creates the Alaska Salmon 
Research Task Force, a group of mem-
bers from the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council, 
and Alaskan stakeholders, to ensure 
that Alaskans are at the forefront of 
the Alaskan salmon research efforts 
taking place in their backyards. 
I believe the bill is a fitting tribute 
to our departed friend. It elevates Alas-
kan voices, especially Native Alaskans, 
and it brings stakeholders together to 
build consensus and find a practical so-
lution to this pressing issue in our 49th 
State. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation to safeguard Alaskan salm-
on fisheries for generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6651, the Alaska Salmon Research 
Task Force Act, sponsored by our late 
colleague, the dean of the House, Rep-
resentative Don Young of Alaska. 
The day before his passing, Congress-
man Don Young was in our Natural Re-
sources Committee room discussing the 
need for this legislation. 
Since 2018 alone, the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration 
has issued 14 fisheries disasters deter-
minations in Alaska. This bill seeks 
scientific answers and recommenda-
tions to solve these declining salmon 
runs. 
Specifically, the bill would require 
the Secretary of Commerce, in con-
sultation with the Governor of Alaska, 
to create an Alaska Salmon Research 
Task Force composed of up to 19 indi-
viduals representing various sectors of 
the salmon economy and culture. 
The intent of the task force is to cre-
ate a coordinated salmon research 
strategy, and support collaboration 
and coordination in salmon conserva-
tion efforts. The task force must also 
produce a report and recommendations 
within 1 year of convening. 
If Mr. Young were here today, I am 
certain that he would remind us that 
salmon are important to Alaskans due 
to their cultural, economic, and rec-
reational value. I urge my colleagues 
to honor the late dean of the House by 
supporting this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support of the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6651. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the matter under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of S. 497, the American Fisheries 
Advisory Committee Act, led by Sen-
ator SULLIVAN and the late Representa-
tive Don Young. 
This legislation establishes a com-
mittee to manage awards for fisheries 
research and development grants. This 
important funding, provided under a 
grant program at NOAA, helps main-
tain sustainable, competitive fisheries 
and working waterfronts. 
The 
fishery 
advisory 
committee 
would be comprised of representatives 
from the different coastal regions of 
the United States and would include 
members of the seafood harvesting and 
processing industries. This structure 
ensures that research and funding deci-
sions are informed by those who work 
and live in each region. 
The inclusion of seafood harvesters 
and processors, recreational and com-
mercial fishers and growers, and mem-
bers of the fishery science community 
as representatives for each region will 
promote equitable, sustainable, and 
science-based fisheries management, 
ensuring longevity and productivity of 
this vital industry. 
I urge support of the legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 497, the American Fisheries Advi-
sory Committee Act, introduced by 
Senator DAN SULLIVAN of Alaska. 
This legislation is simple: It directs 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration 
to 
reestablish 
an 
American 
Fisheries 
Advisory 
Com-
mittee for the purpose of selecting 
grant projects that meet the research 
needs and priorities of the commercial 
fishing industry. 
This committee will include a board 
of experts, with members chosen re-
gionally and across all sectors of the 
fishing industry, and will help provide 
significant 
input 
on 
how 
research 
grants will be focused on fishing com-
munities. 
One goal of this bill is to keep fishing 
communities 
healthy 
and 
viable 
through local collaboration. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, which 
was introduced in the House our late 
colleague, Representative Don Young, 
and commend Representative YOUNG 
and Senator SULLIVAN for their efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
have the same response as the gen-
tleman, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 497. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the matter under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 441, the Don 
Young Alaska Native Health Care Land 
Transfers Act of 2022, serves as a testa-
ment to the legacy of advocacy that 
the late dean of the House and our 
friend, Don Young of Alaska, provided 
Alaska Natives. 
This particular legislation was some-
thing that he was urging—as recently 
as right before his passing, before we 
all left—upon me to move as quickly as 
possible, and I am glad that we have 
been able to get it to this point. 
This legislation directs the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices to convey certain parcels of land 
to the Tanana Tribal Council, the 
Southeast 
Alaska 
Regional 
Health 
Consortium, and the Alaska Native 
Tribal Health Consortium for the pur-
pose of expanding social and healthcare 
services. 
b 1615 
Together, these three nonprofit enti-
ties support the Alaska Native commu-
nities as Tribal health and social serv-
ice providers in both urban and rural 
settings. 
The Tanana Tribal Council, located 
in Tanana, Alaska, provides outpatient 
services to Alaska Natives. Since the 
council is rurally located, healthcare 
services are often underfunded and 
harder to come by. 
This legislation’s conveyance of ap-
proximately 11.25 acres of land to the 
council will allow it to build a new fa-
cility and expand existing services to 
its Indian Health Service beneficiaries, 
thereby increasing the quality of care 
available. 
The 
Southeast 
Alaska 
Regional 
Health Consortium delivers care to 
Alaska Natives as one of the oldest and 
largest Native-run healthcare organiza-
tions in the United States. The consor-
tium operates the Mt. Edgecumbe Hos-
pital, a 25-bed critical access facility 
located in Sitka, Alaska, which is in 
serious need of renovation due to its 
age and current condition. 
This 
legislation’s 
conveyance 
of 
roughly 10.87 acres of land to the con-
sortium will facilitate the planned 
modernization of the hospital by grant-
ing the consortium title to the acreage. 
The Alaska Native Tribal Health 
Consortium 
serves 
the 
healthcare 
needs of thousands of Alaska Native 
and American Indian patients in south- 
central Alaska. The consortium pro-
vides medical services at the Alaska 
Native Medical Center in Anchorage, 
Alaska, and provides wellness pro-
grams, disease research and preven-
tion, rural provider trainings, as well 
as water and sanitation systems con-
struction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4489 
April 26, 2022 
This legislation will grant the con-
sortium ownership over two parcels of 
land totaling approximately 3.5 acres, 
thus 
allowing 
the 
consortium 
to 
streamline its operations and conduct 
building refurbishments without reli-
ance on the Federal Government. 
My late friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative Don Young, championed 
these three land transfers, now com-
bined into H.R. 441, to promote health 
equity among rural Alaska Natives. 
His work on behalf of Indian Country 
never ceased throughout his time in 
Congress. 
I am grateful that we are here today 
to support this legislation and these 
three critical Tribal health entities in 
Alaska, a reminder of the support that 
Indian Country received from Don 
Young. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill and call for its swift passage, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 441, as amended, that will 
direct the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, acting through the 
Indian Health Service, to convey by 
warranty deed and for health-related 
activities certain parcels of Federal 
land to the Tanana Tribal Council, the 
Southeast 
Alaska 
Regional 
Health 
Consortium, and the Alaska Native 
Tribal Health Consortium. 
This amended text is a compilation 
of three separate Indian healthcare 
land transfer bills for the State of 
Alaska introduced by the late Con-
gressman Don Young. All three of 
these bills were favorably reported out 
of the Committee on Natural Resources 
by unanimous consent during this Con-
gress. 
The first land transfer directed under 
this act includes 10.25 acres of land in 
Tanana, Alaska. In 1995, the Tanana 
Tribal Council assumed responsibility 
for healthcare services from the Indian 
Health Service. The parcel of land the 
Tribe is seeking title to encompasses a 
portion of a former Indian Health Serv-
ice hospital site. The council intends to 
use the land to construct a new com-
munity 
wellness 
clinic, 
expand 
eldercare, and develop nursing services. 
The second transfer includes 10.87 
acres of land that is part of the Mt. 
Edgecumbe Hospital campus in Sitka, 
Alaska. The Southeast Alaska Re-
gional Health Consortium is a Native- 
run nonprofit health organization that 
assumed responsibility for providing 
healthcare services from the Indian 
Health Service in 1976 and currently 
operates its Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital in 
Sitka. The consortium intends to use 
the parcel to support future hospital 
expansion and replacement. 
The third land transfer under this act 
includes 3.5 acres of land that is part of 
the Alaska Native Medical Center cam-
pus in Anchorage. In 1999, the Alaska 
Native Tribal Health Consortium as-
sumed responsibility for healthcare 
services from the Indian Health Serv-
ice, and the consortium provides com-
prehensive medical services at the 
Alaska Native Medical Center. 
The ANTHC is the largest Native-run 
nonprofit health organization in the 
United 
States, 
serving 
more 
than 
178,000 Native Alaskans. Gaining title 
to the parcels will enable the ANTHC 
to streamline its operations, update 
and refurbish, and expand the hos-
pital’s capacity to offer health services 
to patients outside of Anchorage. 
Before I conclude, I will take a mo-
ment to again recognize all the hard 
work Congressman Young put into 
serving his constituents and, notably, 
his work for Native people in Alaska 
during his tenure in Congress. I think 
it is more than appropriate that we are 
renaming this legislation after the late 
dean of the House, further memori-
alizing his efforts for Native Alaskans. 
Mr. Young will be deeply missed by all 
of us. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative BENTZ
for his 
work on these pieces of legislation 
today and acknowledge his work on 
Representative MENG’s H.R. 3525, in 
particular. There were difficult things 
to navigate there, and we appreciate 
the effort on his part. Hopefully, we 
were as cooperative. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 441, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to provide for the 
conveyance of certain property to the 
Tanana 
Tribal 
Council 
located 
in 
Tanana, Alaska, the conveyance of cer-
tain property to the Southeast Alaska 
Regional Health Consortium located in 
Sitka, Alaska, and the conveyance of 
certain property to the Alaska Native 
Tribal Health Consortium located in 
Anchorage, Alaska, and for other pur-
poses.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

AMERICAN FISHERIES ADVISORY 
COMMITTEE ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 497) to establish the American

BACK THE BLUE 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to remember the 73 police of-
ficers who lost their lives in the line of 
duty last year across our Nation. 
Law enforcement officers put their 
lives on the line every day to keep our 
communities safe and protect those 
who cannot protect themselves. Sup-
porting our brave men and women in 
law enforcement should not be a polar-
izing issue, but unfortunately, activist 
groups and politicians have called to 
defund the police and, in some cases, 
inspired 
and 
encouraged 
violence 
against the thin blue line. 
Already in 2022, shootings of police 
officers have spiked 43 percent across 
our country. Sadly, we will only see 
more officers killed from antipolice 
rhetoric spewed by the radical left. 
The absence of law enforcement 
means our communities are less safe 
and enables crime to surge, and thugs 
will roam the streets freely without 
consequence. 
I stand here tonight to say, without 
reservation, that I back the blue, and I 
will continue to do everything I can to 
get them the resources they need to do 
their jobs and make America safe 
again.

CELEBRATING JOHN E. 
QUATROCHE’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate Dr. John E. Quatroche’s 100th 
birthday on May 2 of this year. 
Mr. Quatroche is a longtime resident 
of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He is 
an accomplished veterinarian and a 
World War II veteran. 
At 22 years old, John enlisted in the 
Army Air Corps, which is now the 
United States Air Force. He was a 
transport 
pilot 
and 
flew 
C–47s. 
Throughout his service, he had many 
jobs, but one of the most important 
was towing gliders during the last air-
drops of the Second World War. 
After service, John returned to Punx-
sutawney, earning his veterinary de-
gree, and he served as a local veteri-
narian for nearly 60 years. 
I had the privilege of being with John 
and his wife, Irene, on Sunday. We cele-
brated his birthday a little early as a 
part of Loyalty Day in Punxsutawney. 
John, congratulations on this mag-
nificent milestone. I pray that God will 
continue to richly bless you; your wife, 
Irene; and your family. Happy birth-
day. 
f 
VETERAN OF THE MONTH 
CORPORAL RAY SIMS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Corporal Ray Sims, an 
American hero who served during the 
Korean war. Corporal Sims enlisted in 
the United States Army and was sent 
to South Korea following his initial 
training. 
On January 31, 1951, his company was 
attempting to drive the enemy from an 
excellent defensive position on Hill 592. 
During the mission, Corporal Sims no-
ticed a hostile emplacement containing 
an automatic weapons crew. Corporal 
Sims realized that the attention of the 
enemy gunners needed to be distracted 
so another element could flank and de-
stroy the bunker. 
He moved forward with his rocket 
launcher and fired upon the enemy. 
Corporal Sims successfully distracted 
the enemy but was wounded during his 
efforts. He kept firing on the position 
despite his injuries, which allowed his 
company to flank and capture the posi-
tion. 
It took 18 months of surgeries and re-
habilitation for Corporal Sims to fully 
recover from the wounds he received 
that day. For his bravery, Corporal 
Sims was awarded the Bronze Star 
with valor, Purple Heart, National De-
fense Service Medal, United Nations 
Service Medal, and Korean War Service 
Medal. 
Our country’s heroes are the men and 
women of our Armed Forces, Madam 
Speaker—not the ones who throw the 
football or catch the baseball or shoot 
the basket—like Ray Sims, who served 
and sacrificed for our freedom. He is a 
real hero. 
It is my honor to recognize Corporal 
Ray Sims as Tennessee’s Second Dis-
trict April 2022 Veteran of the Month.

DEMOCRACY OVER AUTOCRACY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I was pleased to join the Hoyer codel to 
Europe, which included a number of 
countries and also the border between 
Poland and Ukraine. That is why I am 
stunned by the remarks of Foreign 
Minister Lavrov, who indicates that, 
‘‘Russia warns of nuclear war risks as 
Ukraine talks go on.’’ 
Let me speak directly to Foreign 
Minister Lavrov. Maybe Russia should 
stop the bestiality, the cruelty, the 
brutality of this war, the killing of 
children and seniors, and leaving peo-
ple to starve, and leaving their soldiers 
on the battlefield. 
It is important that peace talks have 
an opportunity but saber-rattling gets 
you nowhere. And frankly, you would 
be as much afraid of a nuclear outright 
war than anyone else. Ukraine has a 
right to be a sovereign-free nation. 
Their children have a right to grow up 
free in this world, and democracy has a 
right to exist over autocracy. 
I believe this is Putin’s war, a sense-
less, vile, and violent war. 
Thank you to the strength of the peo-
ple of Ukraine. It is important that the 
Biden administration do as they have 
done. We should applaud them for what 
they are doing, as well as acknowledge 
what Germany is now doing in pro-
viding the air-to-ground weapons. 
Stand with Ukraine and stop the 
saber-rattling. 
Russia, stop the war. 
f 
TRAGEDY AND CRISIS AT OUR 
BORDER 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, we 
have a continued tragedy and crisis at 
our border. 
Since President Biden took office, 
over 2.2 million illegal immigrants 
have been apprehended at the southern 
border. In March alone, there were over 
220,000 illegal encounters at our border, 
a 600 percent or so increase since 2020. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s complete disregard for their 
obligation to secure our border is hav-
ing tragic impacts on America and in 
the great Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. 
Madam Speaker, in fact, today in a 
briefing on title 42, the Biden adminis-
tration did not lay out a plan on how 
they were going to prevent an over-
whelming surge at our southern border 
from lifting of title 42, but instead de-
scribe their efforts to increase the 
number of accommodations, buses, and 
secret plane flights that have occurred 
in my district, and they will need to 
move the mass number of illegals com-
ing into our country. 
These are reckless, inhumane poli-
cies. They need to be stopped. They 
need to be corrected. And this House— 
both Republicans and Democrats—need 
to stand up for our citizens. 
f 
CRISIS AT OUR BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to report on what I did dur-
ing my time off. I spent time at the 
Mexican border, both in San Diego and 
Yuma, and received a further shock, if 
that is possible, on what I think is the 
most important story facing America 
today. Indeed, every reporter or every 
major news organization ought to have 
somebody making daily reports on the 
border. 
Two weeks ago tonight, in Yuma, I 
saw two groups—about 80 people— 
crossing the border. So you under-
stand, those people were from Colom-
bia, 
Venezuela, 
Peru, 
Cuba, 
Ban-
gladesh, India, and Uzbekistan. In 
other words, the whole world is coming 
here. 
Because of the huge amount of paper-
work, the average Border Patrol agent 
reports to work, and unlike imme-
diately guarding the border, like they 
should, 70 percent of them are doing 
paperwork. At the end of their shift, 90 
percent are doing paperwork. 
For that reason, it is not surprising 
the confiscation of drugs is going 
down—not because there are less drugs 
coming into our country and killing 
100,000 people a year. The reason so few 
drugs are being confiscated is we have 
a shortage of Border Patrol agents and 
they have got to spend all their time 
doing paperwork. 
Madam Speaker, I beg the rest of my 
colleagues to go to the border and 
learn about this. 
f 
VFW POST 660 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
90th birthday of the Veterans of For-
eign Wars Post 660 in Savannah. 
Post 660 is the oldest veteran service 
organization in Savannah and has 
helped the veteran community tremen-
dously through fellowship, charity, and 
patriotism. 
The VFW Organization traces its 
roots back to 1899 when veterans of the 
Spanish-American War and the Phil-
ippine Insurrection founded local orga-
nizations to secure rights and benefits 
for their service. 
Since then, the VFW has aided count-
less veterans in their post-service life 
and continue to carry on the legacy of 
service. Post 660 in Savannah has been 
a prime example of what the organiza-
tion was founded on and what it set out 
to do. The VFW has raised money for 
memorials, such as the Vietnam and 
Korean War memorials in Washington, 
D.C. 
It has also worked with the Veteran’s 
Administration to craft the GI Bill for 
the 20th century. These feats are only a 
few that speak to the impact this orga-
nization has had on our community 
and our country. 
I thank and congratulate VFW Post 
660 for their 90 years of service to Sa-
vannah’s veterans, and I look forward 
to the years to come.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO MADELEINE 
ALBRIGHT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Ms. SLOTKIN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
for unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on the subject of 
the Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR). 
UKRAINE DEMOCRACY DEFENSE LEND-LEASE ACT 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
tonight to urge passage of the Lend- 
Lease Act for Ukraine. I think Mad-
eleine Albright would like this very 
much. 
Putin’s unprovoked war on the sov-
ereign nation of Ukraine is an attack 
on freedom-loving people around our 
globe. Not since the costly tragic wars 
of the 20th century has the world seen 
such a test of liberty’s survival. 
The Lend-Lease is an uncommon tool 
for uncommon times. These are uncom-
mon times. 
Justice 
Franklin 
Roosevelt 
mar-
shaled U.S. arms for the aid of our al-
lies in World War II. We must now mar-
shal those same resources to defeat a 
tyrant seeking to rebuild his fallen, ty-
rannical empire. 
Ukraine is the scrimmage line for 
liberty on the European Continent. If 
the world allows Putin to claw Ukraine 
under his command, our Central and 
Eastern European allies may very well 
be next. 
The time to act is now. Pass the 
Lend-Lease Act. Arm Ukraine. Defeat 
the Russian war machine. The fate of 
liberty rests in the balance. This is our 
watch in freedom’s defense. Let us 
meet this test. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman very much for yielding time. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of our 
country’s greatest public servants and 
diplomats.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4492 
April 26, 2022 
Madeleine Albright was a states-
woman, a trailblazer, and someone who 
has been a friend and mentor to me and 
to so many other women in national 
security. 
I appreciate Speaker PELOSI and Ma-
jority Leader HOYER for creating this 
Special Order hour and allowing me to 
host it here and allow Members of Con-
gress from across this entire body to 
contribute some remarks, some rec-
ognition, for a woman who has done so 
much to change the course of history 
in the United States. 
I think it is particularly important 
because not only was she our first Sec-
retary of State, not only was she at the 
U.N., not only does she have a storied 
history in national security in the ex-
ecutive branch, she was also here in 
Congress as a Congressional aide, a 
chief of staff, a national security staff-
er, that made her mark in this body as 
well. 
She was also a national security 
staffer at the White House, one of the 
first women to represent our country 
in the United Nations and, of course, 
our very first female Secretary of 
State. 
Her 
remarkable 
career 
and 
achievements are made all the more 
astonishing by the fact that she first 
came to this country as a refugee, hav-
ing first left Czechoslovakia to escape 
the Nazis and then again to flee com-
munist rule in Eastern Europe after 
the Second World War. 
Secretary Albright would be the first 
one to tell you that her story would 
only be possible in the United States, 
the country she loved and served even 
long after her time in government had 
come to an end. 
She left her stamp at the U.N. and at 
the State Department with her intel-
ligence, her passion for human rights, 
and her unwavering commitment to 
democratic ideals. On the world stage, 
she stood up to dictators, shined the 
light on human rights abuses, and 
championed diplomacy and democracy. 
Even though she had always been an 
idol for me as a young woman in na-
tional security, I actually didn’t get a 
chance to meet her until 2018, until I 
became a Member of Congress. But the 
years that I have spent getting to know 
her since then have been incredibly im-
portant to me. 
I think what many of us will recog-
nize and remember is the class of 2018— 
that large group that were elected in 
2018 to come into this body—it had the 
most women that had ever been elect-
ed; one of the most diverse classes that 
had ever been elected; one of the class-
es that contained the largest number of 
national security people; people that 
were veterans; and people that were 
former intelligence community folks— 
like myself. Madeleine Albright was 
the speaker when we all traveled to 
Williamsburg for our orientation, our 
session to get to know each other and 
how to be a Member of Congress. 
I met her there, along with her won-
derful chief of staff, Jacob Freedman, 
and basically had the honor of hosting 
her and walking her around the room. 
What I remember very clearly is that 
she had admiration coming at her from 
every corner: young, old, early parts of 
their career, later parts of their career, 
and, importantly, Democrat and Re-
publican. 
One of the fondest memories I have 
from that first year with her was when 
she actually took me up on an offer to 
come to Michigan in early 2020, right 
before the pandemic really began. We 
did a road trip around Michigan to-
gether. 
I will go into that in just a moment, 
but I note that the Speaker has just ar-
rived on the floor. 
We did this road trip across mid- 
Michigan. She was already over 80 
years old. She took me up on this offer. 
She spoke at Michigan State Univer-
sity. She spoke at Oakland University. 
She did events for folks at restaurants 
and in private homes. We had her on an 
incredibly busy schedule. She kept us 
on our toes, and she was never short of 
a kind word or a borderline saucy joke 
the entire time. No matter where we 
went, her presence was electric. 
One of my proudest moments was 
when we brought in all the honor stu-
dents from the Rochester and Roch-
ester Hills area. These are young peo-
ple, still in high school. I actually 
questioned whether they would have a 
connection to this woman who had 
been the first female Secretary of 
State long before some of them were 
born. It took about 1 second for her to 
get a complete rock star welcome. All 
the students who came out were des-
perate to talk to her about service, 
about being the first female Secretary 
of State, about how to think about 
leading in their own careers, and all 
the barriers that she had shattered. 
At a separate event at Oakland Uni-
versity, the reception was no less bois-
terous. We had, I think, up to 500 peo-
ple. We were oversold; people from 
across the community wanted to come 
in. And even at a moment of deep po-
larization for our country, here was a 
woman who seemed to supersede poli-
tics. 
For us in Michigan, with so many 
Michiganders who left the Balkans to 
come to the United States and reset-
tled in Michigan, she, with that com-
munity, is truly a hero. It is now 
etched firmly into the history books 
that Secretary Albright was the driv-
ing force behind engaging the United 
States and ending the genocide in the 
Balkans. 
She understood that while America is 
not perfect, the world is better off with 
a strong American leadership role in 
that world. She used her moral author-
ity to bring American might into that 
conflict and then later negotiated the 
peace that, ever-tenuous, still holds 
today. 
Her visit to Michigan was filled with 
people whose fates were quite literally 
changed by her having a seat at the 
table as Secretary of State, and being 
able to see that up close was a truly re-
markable experience for me and for all 
the people who came to greet her. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t point out 
that as someone who has spent her ca-
reer in national security, there just 
aren’t that many senior women we 
have to look up to for guidance, for 
mentorship. There are very few women 
who had navigated the complicated 
waters of working and leading in male- 
dominated fields. 
Not only did Secretary Albright blaze 
a new trail for women in national secu-
rity, she also raised the bar for all of 
those who would succeed her. She be-
came the gold standard. Despite all the 
accomplishments and accolades, this 
was a woman who never let ego cloud 
her actions. 
b 1930 
She was humble and gracious with 
everyone I saw her meet and engage 
with in Michigan, students, parents, 
perfect strangers. She was generous 
with her wisdom and insights, but 
never full of herself. 
For her, the work she did in govern-
ment was always about serving the 
country that she loved, the country 
that welcomed her and her family as 
refugees when she was just 11 year old. 
Her preferred way of continuing to 
serve after leaving office was by teach-
ing the next generation of national se-
curity leaders. Her passion for her stu-
dents at Georgetown University was 
evident to everyone around her, and it 
is no exaggeration to say that an en-
tire generation of rising public serv-
ants are better prepared for the chal-
lenges of the 21st century thanks to her 
guiding hand. 
So this is how I will remember her: 
As a down-to-earth, warm, saucy leader 
who 
meant 
something 
to 
perfect 
strangers and world leaders alike. I am 
so grateful for the years that I had to 
get to know her and for the chance to 
introduce her to the next generation in 
my State. 
As we mourn the loss of this incred-
ible humanitarian, we also celebrate 
the life and achievements of a woman 
whose impact, both here at home and 
in the farthest corners of the globe, 
will be felt for many years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Congresswoman SLOTKIN for ar-
ranging for this Special Order and for 
just speaking so beautifully about 
Madeleine Albright, a person that we 
all loved so very, very much for so 
many years. And to hear the gentle-
woman, a new Member, a relatively 
new Member of Congress, but a woman 
in national security making her own 
mark in a significant way, recognize 
the greatness of Madeleine, it is just a 
joy to us to see another generation of 
women leaders in security speaking 
about Madeleine. 
Madeleine Albright was a states-
woman. She was a champion of na-
tional security in our country. She was

the 
embodiment 
of 
the 
American 
Dream; her family coming when she 
was 11 years old, a refugee to our 
shores. Her personal story is the mak-
ings of novels and movies and the rest. 
But she was fresh and frisky, and she 
had a sense of humor that was wonder-
ful. And I remember the night that 
there was a debate in St. Louis for the 
Presidential, when President Clinton 
was running for President; we had din-
ner after the debate. And I said well, 
Madeleine, would you like—are you in-
terested in participating in the admin-
istration? 
I was a relatively new Member of 
Congress at the time. And she said, I 
am not going—I don’t want to go over-
seas. I said, I know what you want. You 
want to be Ambassador to the U.N. Be-
cause that would be of the stature, and 
yet she did not want to go overseas. 
She wanted to be home for all kinds of 
different reasons. And what a magnifi-
cent Ambassador she was for us to the 
United Nations. 
And then, as it would turn out, to be-
come the first woman to be Secretary 
of State. This is such an exalted posi-
tion. Thomas Jefferson was Secretary 
of State. And Madeleine Albright was 
Secretary of State. 
And as Congresswoman SLOTKIN said, 
she had boundless energy. She would 
be—well, she was on the campaign trail 
after serving as Secretary of State, on 
the campaign trail, and she was, as the 
gentlewoman said, a rock star. She was 
a major attraction. People loved to see 
her. 
I want to say, because my husband 
loved her so much, my husband, Paul, 
who was the chairman of the board of 
the Georgetown School of Foreign 
Service for a couple of decades I think. 
It seemed like a long time. He wor-
shipped at the shrine of Madeleine 
Albright. When she would call me, if he 
had the phone first, I would have a 
hard time getting it away from him be-
cause he thought they were the best of 
friends. She was my girlfriend in addi-
tion to being someone I admired so 
greatly. 
And she would always call the day 
before your birthday because she want-
ed to be the first one to wish you happy 
birthday which, of course, I was look-
ing forward to this year. And instead, 
we would get this very sad news, with 
all the dignity of Madeleine Albright, 
with all of the warmth and greatness of 
her, be with her family, right up to the 
end. 
Alice, Anne, and Katherine, thank 
you for sharing your mother with us; 
and again, to sister, Kathy, and broth-
er, John. 
Another thing I want to mention 
about her is I don’t know how many of 
you were at the funeral of Brzezinski, 
National Security Advisor Brzezinski. 
Two people spoke at his funeral in the 
church. Some of us spoke afterward in 
the more informal setting. But two 
people spoke at his funeral; President 
Jimmy Carter and Secretary Madeleine 
Albright. And what a beautiful com-
pliment to speak for another great 
American patriot born overseas and 
coming to America to make his mark. 
And she spoke so beautifully about 
America and about patriotism, about 
civic responsibility, and of the con-
tribution he made; that she was chosen 
to make that speech with the President 
was really so clearly appropriate and 
great to hear her speak. 
Now, she had a collection of pins, and 
she would always say, when she would 
go to give testimony or whatever it is, 
‘‘read my pins.’’ Sometimes it would be 
an American eagle. We never knew 
what it might be. And she even toured 
the country with her pins, and people 
showed up to see Madeleine’s pins, be-
cause she had something about her 
that was—she knew how to connect 
with people. You know, this great in-
tellect and the rest. 
I will just go back to Paul in closing 
to say this: She taught at Georgetown 
for 40 years, for 40 years. The gentle-
woman mentioned this next generation 
of young diplomats and the rest. They 
took such pride in her leadership, her 
service, her being a professor there, 
that they were cooking up how they 
were going to observe her 40 years and 
this or that; and again, she had other 
plans, to be in heaven and look down 
on all of us. 
How wonderful it is that tomorrow, 
many of her friends from Congress 
and—she made us all feel as if we were 
her best friends. I mean, I thought so. 
So many of her loved ones, whether 
they were diplomats or people in serv-
ice, would be there to praise her as an 
Ambassador to the United Nations and 
Secretary of State, she represented our 
Nation with great poise and distinction 
and brilliance on the world stage and 
worked relentlessly to keep Americans 
safe and America secure. 
As a trusted voice on foreign policy, 
and those jobs, and beyond, and be-
yond, because her influence extended 
long after her actual service in public 
office, but also as a professor, she was 
quick to sound the alarm at the rise of 
autocracy. As you know, she wrote 
about that in her book, at home and 
abroad, a prescient warning that re-
mains an important guide and resource 
today. 
And then, as a professor at George-
town, which we, the Pelosi family, take 
great pride. My husband went there; 
my kids went there; I have an honorary 
degree there, and we all feel associated 
with Madeleine. 
She shaped the next generation of 
leadership by sharing her hard-earned 
wisdom and experience. 
So tomorrow, many of her loved 
ones, whether it is from government, 
politics, 
security, 
academic 
world, 
friendship, girlfriends, hair dressers, 
wherever we met together, her family, 
first and foremost, which she loved so 
much, will join Madeleine’s family and 
her loved ones to pay our final respects 
at her memorial at the glorious Wash-
ington National Cathedral. 
I said final respects. I meant final re-
spects for tomorrow. We will be paying 
our respects to her in many things that 
are being planned already. The pres-
ence of so many Members and dip-
lomats at her memorial, and two Presi-
dents of the United States to speak at 
her service, will be another testament 
to the monumental impact she made 
on our Nation and the world. 
I wish everyone would read the op-ed 
that another Secretary of State, a na-
tional figure, Hillary Clinton, wrote 
about Madeleine Albright. They were 
kindred spirits. They loved each other 
very much. They worked together with 
great respect for each other and for our 
country in such a beautiful way. 
Please, if you can, go to The New 
York Times and read what the Sec-
retary of State—I think she may be 
speaking tomorrow, too. I don’t know 
what the program is. I think she may 
be speaking tomorrow, too. 
So God truly blessed America with 
the life and the service and the leader-
ship and the goodness of Madeleine 
Albright. May she forever rest in peace. 
And again, I thank Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN for affording us all the oppor-
tunity to pay our respects to our dear 
Madam 
Ambassador, 
Madam 
Sec-
retary, Madeleine Albright. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Speaker for that personal 
tribute. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman from Michigan 
for yielding. And the Speaker pro tem, 
Ms. 
JACOBS, 
how 
proud 
Madeleine 
Albright would be of the two of you 
standing here, presiding here, and giv-
ing tribute to an extraordinary woman 
who must have been, particularly for 
women—she was for me as well, but 
particularly for women, an extraor-
dinary example of success, of focus, of 
intellect, of achievement. And I thank 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
SLOTKIN) for taking this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, tomorrow, as the 
Speaker just said, at the National Ca-
thedral, really the cathedral—Amer-
ica’s cathedral, many of us will gather 
to remember and celebrate the extraor-
dinary life of former Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright. 
Secretary Albright was a dear and 
valued friend for over 35 years. As the 
chair of the Helsinki Commission, I 
worked closely with her on issues re-
lated to human rights and foreign af-
fairs for years, for a decade that I was 
chair. 
Secretary Albright was a diplomat, a 
teacher, and a mentor to so many who 
now serve in our diplomatic corps and 
the world of foreign policy. 
She was an author who used her pen 
and her voice to urge us both to see the 
untapped possibilities in our world, and 
not to ignore the dangers that con-
fronted our country, our freedom, and 
our democracy. 
Perhaps 
most 
of 
all, 
Secretary 
Albright was someone who never forgot 
the experience of being a refugee and a 
survivor of war and genocide. It gave

her great insight and determination to 
confront the enemies of freedom and 
human rights. 
Her family fled Czechoslovakia when 
it fell under the oppression of Nazi oc-
cupation. 
Her 
determination 
was 
spurred as well when Czechoslovakia 
fell under Stalin’s heel. That experi-
ence pushed her to spend her life work-
ing to keep others safe from those evils 
and to ensure that the world’s democ-
racies, led by America, took action to 
help those fleeing conflict and danger. 
In 2018, she released a masterful book 
that everyone ought to read: ‘‘Fascism: 
A warning.’’ 
She said in that book: ‘‘Throughout 
his time in office,’’ she wrote of Vladi-
mir Putin, ‘‘He has stockpiled power at 
the expense of provincial governors, 
the legislature, the courts, the private 
sector, and the press. A suspicious 
number of those who have found fault 
with him have later been jailed on du-
bious charges or murdered in cir-
cumstances never explained.’’ 
She saw then very clearly the threat 
that he and others pose to democracy 
in our time. 
I miss her wise words. Luckily, she 
wrote a lot of them down and those 
were some that we certainly ought to 
remember; those insights, as Ukraine’s 
brave fighters battle a new tyranny 
and another criminal dictator. 
After she died, just days following 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
criminal 
and 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, 
former Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton, whom the Speaker just mentioned, 
said: ‘‘As has happened so often, the 
man with the guns was wrong, and 
Madeleine was right.’’ 
Right now, as the world confronts 
Putin’s aggression, as we and our fel-
low 
democracies 
stand 
up 
to 
authoritarianism and tyranny, we do 
so better prepared, Madam Speaker, 
because of the warning and lessons 
that Secretary Albright gave us. 
b 1945 
In many ways, the most fitting trib-
ute to her memory is the unity we and 
our allies are demonstrating in the face 
of Putin’s threat to democracy, de-
cency, and international law. 
Before Secretary Albright’s death, 
President Biden had committed $424 
million toward his Presidential Initia-
tive for Democratic Renewal, which 
drew heavily on Secretary Albright’s 
proposals and sought to tackle the 
challenges she identified in her book, 
‘‘Fascism: A Warning.’’ ‘‘It is easier,’’ 
she wrote, ‘‘to remove tyrants and de-
stroy concentration camps than to kill 
the ideas that gave them birth.’’ 
This is a war of ideas, and America 
must lead the fight for democracy. 
Now, Secretary Albright’s legacy is 
felt throughout the global alliance of 
our democratic allies and partners con-
fronting Vladimir Putin and Russia to-
gether, where billions of dollars in both 
military and humanitarian assistance 
are being mustered and deployed in de-
fense of democracy and human rights, 
the cause for which she lived and of 
which she spoke so eloquently. 
After Secretary Albright died, I 
spoke at length with my foreign policy 
adviser, Mariah Sixkiller, who was a 
part of the group that met at Secretary 
Albright’s home for 15 years for discus-
sions 
about 
American 
leadership 
around the world. I asked Mariah to 
write a few words of her recollections. 
She told me: ‘‘I was honored to be at 
her table for 15 years and to learn from 
this great stateswoman. She was,’’ as 
the gentlewoman from Michigan has 
pointed out, ‘‘witty, wise, bold, and 
brilliant, even until her final days,’’ 
even, as the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan said, someone as old as 80. 
Mariah Sixkiller went on to say: 
‘‘She had the perfect combination of 
good humor and unique charm.’’ Our 
Speaker just reflected that, as the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan did. ‘‘She 
made us laugh even at the hardest 
times.’’ 
All of us who knew her and who 
worked with her during her time in 
government 
remember 
that 
char-
acteristic wit and charm, along with 
her keen intellect and her vision of a 
more perfect Union and a more perfect, 
peaceful world. 
Madam Speaker, I particularly ad-
mire the dedication she had to the mis-
sion of standing up for the rights of 
women and girls worldwide. 
As the first woman to serve as Sec-
retary of State, a successor to Thomas 
Jefferson and so many other extraor-
dinary leaders who have served in that 
post—including, of course, Secretary 
Clinton—at a time when women were 
still having to prove they belonged in 
boardrooms and around Cabinet tables 
dominated by men, she felt a unique re-
sponsibility to be a voice for girls and 
women striving to be all they could be, 
undefined by gender alone. And she was 
that voice. 
She knew that when women had 
more political, social, and economic 
freedoms, societies are better off in 
every way. Democracies, she believed, 
are stronger, and democratization is 
more successful when women and girls 
can pursue opportunities in safety, 
equality, and freedom. The fight for 
women’s rights never ended for her. 
Even as recently as just a few 
months ago, Secretary Albright was 
working furiously to push for more ac-
tion to help women and girls in Af-
ghanistan. 
We left Afghanistan. We left Afghani-
stan with the hopes that there would 
be 
some 
civilized 
action 
by 
the 
Taliban. Sadly, we have seen that they 
returned to their old ways of discrimi-
nation and putting down, disallowing 
young women to go to school to pre-
pare themselves for leadership. Sec-
retary Albright was active and, as a 
matter of fact, the leader of the Na-
tional Democratic Institute, which she 
chaired and which argued strenuously 
for the rights of those girls and those 
women. 
That was the last time we spoke di-
rectly, as we worked together to help 
save these courageous Afghans who 
dedicated themselves to the goal of 
creating a democratic future in their 
country. 
In the final months of her life, Sec-
retary Albright wrote down some re-
flections to be included in a new mem-
oir. Discussing what she perceived to 
be her own shortcomings, she shared 
this: ‘‘My parents taught me what the 
best teachers tell us all: that it is no 
sin 
to 
make 
a 
mistake 
but 
unpardonable not to try to make the 
most of our talents.’’ 
Fortunately for America and people 
around the globe, Madam Speaker, Sec-
retary Albright made the most of the 
many, many, the legion of talents 
which she had and with which she was 
gifted. 
One of the greatest was as a teacher. 
As the Speaker said, she was a teacher 
for 40 years, and I would correct the 
Speaker and say she was a teacher for 
at least 60-plus years. Although prob-
ably prior to 20, she was a teacher as 
well. She taught thousands of students 
over the course of an almost 40-year ca-
reer in academia. 
As a professor in the practice of di-
plomacy at the Georgetown University 
School of Foreign Service, Secretary 
Albright helped train and launch the 
careers of so many who are leaders 
today for America’s foreign policy and 
national security. 
That is why so many of us are going 
to honor her tomorrow, and we will not 
ever forget what she contributed to 
this country, a perfect example of how 
important it is to accept and have 
come to this country the brightest 
minds, the most committed people. 
What an extraordinary example she 
was of the enrichment that immigra-
tion has given to this country. 
Moreover, she had an unwavering be-
lief that women in the field of foreign 
policy must support each other. 
Mariah didn’t give that quote. I know 
Mariah is listening right now. Mariah 
Sixkiller was my national security ad-
viser, and she worked with me. Very 
frankly, Mariah knew what I believed 
before I believed it. She was extraor-
dinary. The inspiration that Secretary 
Albright gave to Mariah is still fired up 
in her eyes, in her speech, and in her 
thinking. 
Secretary Albright served as a men-
tor to scores of other young women 
who were students, as well as her col-
leagues at the State Department, and 
she strove to ensure that these women 
got a seat at the table. 
Secretary Albright’s legacy will live 
through these women who have fol-
lowed in her footsteps and become the 
Foreign Service officers and ambas-
sadors working hard on behalf of the 
American people today and for a long 
time to come. 
Madam Speaker, we are so fortunate 
to have their talents in service to our 
country 
as 
a 
result 
of 
Secretary 
Albright’s example and advocacy. I, 
again, repeat, as I am sure she is 
watching, she is so proud—I hope of our

friendship—but so proud of Congress-
woman SLOTKIN and so proud of Con-
gresswoman JACOBS as they rise on her 
behalf as leaders of this country. 
Tomorrow, we will bid Secretary 
Albright farewell, but our country and 
its leaders would be wise to keep her 
close in our hearts and in our minds in 
the weeks, months, and years ahead. 
In many ways, the battle underway 
between democracy and despotism is 
one that Secretary Albright so pre-
sciently foresaw. That battle, which 
currently rages in Ukraine, reminds us, 
as she did, that the price of liberty is, 
in fact, eternal vigilance. 
We face a torturous road ahead, one 
that will demand our energy, our faith, 
our perseverance, and our courage, all 
of which Secretary Albright displayed 
throughout her life. 
She believed that democracy would 
surely prevail, but she knew that that 
result required our constant attention. 
When democracy prevails, as surely it 
must, it will be in no small part due to 
her work, her contributions, and her 
service. 
God blessed America with an extraor-
dinary woman whose name was Mad-
eleine Albright, and that name will be 
remembered for a long, long time to 
come. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Thank you, Mr. Lead-
er, for those words. 
I know we have a few other Members 
of Congress who are trying to make it 
here, and so I will just say a couple 
more things as we wait for them to 
come in. 
When I was with Secretary Albright 
and brought her to Michigan, we were 
on this road trip. I think most people 
know she is not a tall woman. No one 
ever would describe her as a tall 
woman. She was quite petite. I drove 
her around in my Ford Escape, and we 
had to kind of help her into the front 
seat. 
It happened to be what is called 
Paczki Day in Michigan, Fat Tuesday. 
It is when we all eat these jelly dough-
nuts full of powdered sugar on top. We 
brought a box of those in the car, and 
she indulged me and tried a paczki that 
day. 
We just had hours in the car driving 
around my very large district and got 
to talking. I think that one of the best 
things you can have when you are a 
younger person learning from someone 
who has really broken glass ceilings is 
you have time with them to just hear 
stories about what life was like. 
She told me that her one regret in 
life is that she never ran for Congress. 
She never ran for office. She was a 
chief of staff up here, a legislative as-
sistant. She was adjacent to campaigns 
pretty much her entire adult life, but 
she never actually ran herself. 
I can only imagine how successful 
she would have been as an elected lead-
er because, as Speaker PELOSI men-
tioned, she had that thing where she 
could connect deeply with anyone from 
any background. Not all Members of 
Congress elected today have that, and 
she had it in spades. 
She had an ability, despite all the 
amazing things she had done, to con-
nect with real people, with strangers. I 
think people understood that she was 
confident because she had seen a lot of 
things in her life, and the woman had a 
code. 
She had a code that she believed in, 
a principled place with which she en-
gaged in the world. When you meet 
someone who has a code, you don’t 
have to question whether they are kind 
of like a leaf blowing in the wind, that 
they will bend to whatever whim. You 
have the confidence to know that this 
person is going to make decisions based 
on character and integrity. She really 
had that, and it kind of oozed out of 
her. People could see that and feel 
that. 
I know that this body would have 
been much strengthened should she had 
ever decided to run for office. I am 
sorry that we all didn’t get to see that, 
but she helped so many of us who were 
seeking elected office. 
Then, just to add to what the major-
ity leader said about her famous quote, 
that there is a special place in hell for 
women who don’t help women—I think 
we have all seen that quote. I think 
most women understand exactly what 
that means, but let me just give you an 
example for many of us, particularly in 
national security, of what that really 
meant. 
When I joined the CIA as a young CIA 
officer in 2003, I was put on the Iraq 
desk. We were in the middle of the Iraq 
war, and I would often go and brief the 
senior-most folks at the CIA on kind of 
what was happening on a daily basis. I 
would often go with mostly male col-
leagues into these rooms and brief very 
senior folks. 
At the time, there were a couple— 
just a couple—of very senior women at 
the CIA. They had clawed their way to 
the top. I think at that point, the most 
senior woman was the number three at 
the CIA, and there were a few other 
senior women in the analytics side of 
the house. 
I would go in and brief, and I remem-
ber very clearly going in with all of my 
male colleagues, my peers, and this 
very senior woman kind of had it out 
for the only other woman in the room. 
There was a generation of women who 
were basically so sort of tough in mak-
ing it to the top that they really inter-
nalized this idea that there could only 
be one senior woman. There could only 
be one woman who was in the shop 
with the boys. So any other woman 
that came there was a threat, and you 
were going to put your sights on that 
woman. 
I remember my male colleagues say-
ing, man, like, she just has it out for 
you. It was a thing that a lot of us in 
national security grew up with. Now, I 
am happy to say that, a few years 
later, that generation largely retired, 
and in came the next generation of sen-
ior leaders who believed in lifting 
women up. 
But when Madeleine Albright gives 
that famous quote, that there is a spe-
cial place in hell for women who don’t 
help women, she knows of what she 
speaks. It is not a general statement. 
It is something that I know she specifi-
cally had to deal with as a woman who 
was a leader on the Hill, a leader in the 
executive branch. 
b 2000 
And it is very hard when you are 
trained a certain way to change your 
approach and say I am not going to re-
peat that kind of aggressive focus on 
women, and I am going to learn from 
my experience and do something dif-
ferent. I think she really embodied 
that. That was a very real thing that 
was still going on until relatively re-
cently in national security circles. 
Lastly, 
as 
we 
wait 
for 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI, somewhere in the ether, 
he texted me to say that he was on his 
way. I will say that I noted that Sec-
retary Albright died just about exactly 
a month after the start of the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine. I know that in her 
final days she was watching, I am sure 
with rapt attention, what was hap-
pening in the world. 
As has been said many times tonight, 
she really was a person thinking ahead 
that this competition between democ-
racy and autocracy was not over. It 
was not something of the past, it was 
not a Cold War-era phenomenon that 
didn’t exist anymore. It was very alive, 
like a bone in the throat. 
It gives me great peace that despite 
the terrible things that are going on 
and watching the suffering of the 
Ukrainian 
people 
that 
Madeleine 
Albright spent her life trying to push 
back on the kind of violence and dicta-
torship that we see active right now. 
Her words and lessons are helping us 
parse through what to do in a place 
like Ukraine. 
We have a history in places like Eu-
rope, particularly the Balkans, in using 
American 
willpower 
and 
military 
power to help get us through these con-
flicts because she laid that predicate 
by pushing in her era when she was 
Secretary of State. 
Despite the fact that she didn’t get 
to see the end of this conflict, I know 
that she would feel confident that 
whether it is in a few weeks or a few 
months, whatever time it takes, that 
the principles of democracy and free-
dom are not things you can just snuff 
out with the barrel of a gun. I am sure 
she would have felt that deeply as she 
was watching in her final days the 
events taking place in the world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
when people sometimes ask me to 
name an unusual fun fact about myself, 
something that no one would quite be-
lieve would be true, I sometimes say 
that at a younger point in my life I had 
a chance to write and negotiate a four 
act parody performance of ‘‘West Side 
Story’’ with the Russian Government. I 
owe that experience to Secretary Mad-
eleine Albright.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4496 
April 26, 2022 
I was a young speech writer at the 
State Department when she became 
Secretary of State. I was so thrilled to 
have that opportunity because here I 
was an immigrant from Poland when it 
was a Communist country. Our new 
Secretary of State was an immigrant 
from 
Czechoslovakia, 
leaving 
that 
country under duress with her family 
when it became a Communist country. 
I felt a kinship with this extraordinary 
American, a sense that we saw the 
world in similar terms. 
I saw her in every part of the world 
stand up for our country, for our val-
ues, for our interest. I saw her face 
down dictators and comfort their vic-
tims. I saw her sense of fun. 
In 1997, we were on our way to a 
meeting of the Association of South-
east Asian Nations, ASEAN, in Malay-
sia, and we learned a couple of days in 
advance that there was a tradition that 
every delegation would put on a skit at 
the end of this diplomatic meeting, 
something very, very unusual. We 
heard, furthermore, that the United 
States had developed a reputation for 
really sucking at the skit. That was 
not acceptable to Madeleine Albright. 
She was going to go and stand up for 
democracy in Burma and Cambodia and 
have a standoff with the Chinese over 
the South China Sea, but we were also 
going to win the skit. So she assigned 
me to write a brand new version of 
‘‘Don’t Cry for me Argentina’’ from 
‘‘Evita,’’ which became ‘‘Don’t Cry for 
Me ASEANs.’’ We all got up there and 
performed it, not really knowing what 
the reaction would be. It was reviewed 
in Playbill on Broadway. It was such a 
surprising hit. 
We learned something really inter-
esting, in diplomacy you can actually 
say anything, no matter how sensitive, 
no matter how potentially offensive to 
your diplomatic partners around the 
world, if you make it rhyme and you 
put it in a song. 
So the next year we got even more 
ambitious, and we went to the Rus-
sians, and said, Would you like to do 
‘‘West Side Story’’ with us? They said, 
Yes. So my job over the most stressful 
week of my life, counting my last two 
elections, was to negotiate into long 
hours of the night with the Russian 
diplomats the jokes that we would 
make in this four-act production of 
‘‘West Side Story.’’ 
We didn’t think that they would do it 
until the last minute. The night before 
the performance, at midnight, the for-
eign 
minister 
of 
Russia, 
Yevgeny 
Primakov, who had been the head of 
their KGB, stumbled in with his aides 
into Secretary Albright’s suite com-
pletely drunk, and said, We are ready 
to rehearse. We knew that we had it. 
Those were obviously simpler days, 
better days, when we could fight with 
the Russians on all kinds of issues, but 
still find fellowship and some friend-
ship and some opportunity to laugh to-
gether. 
Times have changed. When I look at 
what is happening right now to the 
brave people of Ukraine and the evil 
that Russia has unleashed on them, 
and so many other terrible things that 
the government of Vladimir Putin has 
done in recent years, I thank goodness 
for what Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright did in the 1990s, particularly 
her role in leading the first expansion 
of the NATO alliance. 
She understood and saw, before most 
people, that it would be unjust to stay 
allied with Europe’s old democracies, 
France, Germany, the United Kingdom 
forever, but Europe’s new democracies 
never, simply because they had once, 
against their will, had been subjugated 
by the Soviet Union. 
She also saw it would be unwise, in 
fact reckless, to allow these Eastern 
European democracies to stay in a gray 
zone of insecurity, to signal to Russia 
that it could, in effect, do what it 
wanted in this zone, that America 
would not defend these countries. 
She said then of NATO expansion 
that it was basically about expanding 
the part of Europe where wars do not 
happen. By making clear that we, the 
United States, will fight, if necessary, 
to defend our allies there, we would 
make the necessity of doing so actually 
far less likely. She was right. 
Not a single member of NATO, old or 
new, has ever been attacked on Euro-
pean soil to this day. The only coun-
tries Russia has attacked are countries 
that do not have NATO’s defense guar-
antee. 
I think one reason she saw these 
things is because as an immigrant to 
America, as an immigrant from tyr-
anny, she saw America from the inside 
but also from the outside. She saw 
what America means—what the idea of 
America means to a human rights de-
fender in Burma, to a dissident in 
China, to a refugee from violence in 
Kosovo or Bosnia. She comforted so 
many of those people and convinced 
them that America was on their side. 
She believed America is a special 
country, indeed, an indispensable coun-
try. She understood that our influence 
in the world comes not just from the 
example of our power, but from the 
power of our example at home. 
In her last years, when I would see 
her, she would often tell me that one of 
her greatest regrets was she never had 
a chance to run for office. She was jeal-
ous of those of us who had worked with 
her over the years who decided to run 
for Congress because she understood 
that we can’t do anything for others if 
we are not safe and strong at home in 
our own great, American democracy. 
Years ago, when I worked for her she 
gave a commencement address, and I 
will just close with these words that 
she spoke: ‘‘There is no certain road-
map to success, either for individuals 
or for generations. Ultimately, it is a 
matter of judgment, a question of 
choice. In making that choice, let us 
remember that there is not a page of 
American history, of which we are 
proud, that was authored by a chronic 
complainer or prophet of despair. We 
are doers. We have a responsibility, as 
others have had in theirs, not to be 
prisoners of history, but to shape his-
tory; a responsibility to fill the role of 
pathfinder, and to build with others a 
global network of purpose and law that 
will protect our citizens, defend our in-
terests, preserve our values, and be-
queath to future generations a legacy 
as proud as the one that we honor 
today. 
‘‘To that mission, I pledge my own 
best efforts and summon yours.’’ 
We pledge our best efforts to that 
mission here today, and we summon 
those of everybody who is watching 
this evening. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those moving 
remarks. 
As I conclude here, I just want to 
thank everyone who came to speak, 
and I feel extremely proud that these 
remarks and just a taste of the Sec-
retary’s legacy will be kept forever in 
the official RECORD
of the people’s 
House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OF-
FICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS 
Implementing Certain Substantive Rights 
and Protections of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938, as Required by Section 203 of the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
(CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1313. 
NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING 
Background: 
The purpose of this Notice is to initiate 
the process for replacing existing legislative 
branch Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) 
overtime substantive regulations under sec-
tion 203 of the Congressional Accountability 
Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1302 et seq., which were 
adopted by the Board and approved by the 
House and the Senate in 1996, with new regu-
lations that substantially mirror the over-
time exemption regulations promulgated by 
the Secretary of Labor thereafter and pres-
ently in effect. These modifications are nec-
essary in order to bring existing legislative 
branch FLSA overtime regulations in line 
with multiple regulatory changes that have 
occurred since 1996. The regulations that 
presently implement the FLSA for the Legis-
lative Branch are woefully out of date be-
cause the Secretary of Labor’s updated 
FLSA regulations do not automatically 
apply to employing offices and employees 
covered by the CAA. As a result, the employ-
ees of the Legislative Branch are presently 
held to FLSA overtime standards that are no 
longer realistic in today’s economy. 
Do FLSA overtime pay requirements apply 
via the CAA to Legislative Branch employing 
offices? 
Yes. Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA states: 
‘‘[t]he rights and protections established by 
subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 
7, and section 12(c) of the [FLSA] . . . (29 
U.S.C. 206(a)(1), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to cov-
ered employees.’’ Section 7 of the FLSA, 29 
U.S.C. 207, includes the requirements regard-
ing the payment of time and one half over-
time pay to employees. 
Are there existing overtime exemption reg-
ulations already in force under the CAA? 
Yes. In 1996, the Board of Directors of the 
Office of Compliance—now the Office of Con-
gressional Workplace Rights—promulgated 
the existing CAA overtime exemption regu-
lations based on Department of Labor’s regu-
lations that were in effect at the time. Those 
regulations were adopted pursuant to the 
CAA section 304 procedure outlined herein 
below. Those regulations are found at Parts 
H541 (applicable to the House of Representa-
tives), S541 (applicable to the Senate), and 
C541 (applicable to the other employing of-
fices covered by section 203 of the CAA) of 
the FLSA Regulations of the (then) Office of 
Compliance. Those regulations remain in 
force in the Legislative Branch until re-
placed by new regulations. The 1996 FLSA 
Substantive regulations can be accessed via 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
web site: www.ocwr.gov. 
What is the history of the FLSA overtime 
salary threshold test? 
Historically, the salary threshold test con-
tained in the Department of Labor’s regula-
tions has been a fixed amount that has not 
changed with inflation. In 2004, the Depart-
ment of Labor promulgated regulations in-
creasing the salary threshold test so that 
employees with low salaries would not be de-
prived of overtime pay. Thus, in 2004, the 
Board of Directors adopted and submitted for 
publication in the Congressional Record 
amendments to its 1996 substantive regula-
tions regarding the FLSA overtime exemp-
tions. 150 Cong. Rec. H7850–07, S9917–01 (daily 
ed. September 29, 2004). 
The 2004 Amendments to the Legislative 
Branch substantive regulations adopted by 
the Board mirrored new overtime exemption 
regulations promulgated by the Department 
of Labor, Vol. 69 of the Federal Register, No. 
79, at pp. 22122 et seq., which substantially 
changed the prior overtime exemptions. 
More specifically, the 2004 FLSA amend-
ments adopted by the Board of Directors re-
flected the new Part 541 in the updated DOL 
regulations then in effect, which restruc-
tured much of the regulatory framework for 
determining whether a particular employee 
is exempt from FLSA overtime require-
ments. The 2004 changes included: (1) elimi-
nating the ‘‘short’’ and ‘‘long tests and revis-
ing the standard duties test for each exemp-
tion category; (2) significantly increasing 
the salary level under DOL’s revised stand-
ard duties test to $455 per week for execu-
tive, administrative, and professional em-
ployee exemptions and (3) creating a ‘‘highly 
compensated executive’’ category in which 
employees who are paid total annual com-
pensation of at least $100,000 (which must in-
clude at least $455 per week paid on a salary 
or fee basis) are exempt from the FLSA’s 
overtime requirements if they customarily 
and regularly perform at least one of the ex-
empt duties or responsibilities of an execu-
tive, administrative, or professional em-
ployee identified in the standard tests for ex-
emption. 
However, because Congress did not approve 
the 2004 amendments adopted by the Board, 
the 2004 DOL regulations containing FLSA 
exemption updates were not made applicable 
to the Legislative Branch. The regulations 
proposed by the Board in this Notice of Pro-
posed 
Rulemaking 
incorporate 
the 
2004 
amendments 
previously 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board after public notice and comment, and 
further update the overtime exemption regu-
lations to mirror further Department of 
Labor changes in 2016, 2019, and 2020. 
Why is this Notice being issued? 
Over the past 25 years, the Secretary of 
Labor has substantially rewritten and ex-
panded Part 541 and has repeatedly increased 
the salary threshold test. However, the Sec-
retary of Labor’s regulations do not auto-
matically apply to employing offices and em-
ployees covered by the CAA. Because the 2004 
amendments adopted by the Board were not 
approved by Congress, unlike the Depart-
ment of Labor’s current regulations, the 
present salary threshold test within the Leg-
islative Branch sets the salary below the 
poverty level. Specifically, the 1996 Sub-
stantive Regulations has a salary basis test 
of ‘‘not less than $155 per week’’ which is an 
annual salary of less than $8000.00 per year. 
In other sections of the 1996 Substantive 
Regulations that remain applicable to the 
Legislative Branch, the salary basis test is 
‘‘not less than $250 per week’’ which is yearly 
salary of approximately $13,000.00. This No-
tice is being issued, in part, to modify this 
substantially lower salary test set by the 
1996 FLSA Substantive Regulations that are 
financially outdated and yet remain in ef-
fect. 
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is oc-
casioned by the promulgation of new over-
time exemption regulations by the Secretary 
of Labor at Vol. 69 of the Federal Register, 
No. 79, at pp. 22122 et seq., on August 23, 2004; 
Vol. 81 of the Federal Register, at pp. 32391 et 
seq., on May 23, 2016; Vol. 84 of the Federal 
Register, at pp. 51230 et seq., on September 
27, 2019; and Vol. 85 of the Federal Register, 
at pp. 34970–01 et seq., on June 8, 2020. The 
new regulations of the Secretary of Labor as 
set out at 29 U.S.C. Part 541, reflect the sub-
stantial restructuring of overtime exemp-
tions described above, which to date have 
not yet been made applicable to the Legisla-
tive Branch. 
Is the Board proposing to adopt the cur-
rent Department of Labor Regulations ver-
batim? 
The Board has deliberated regarding the 
question of whether ‘‘good cause’’ exists pur-
suant to section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1313(c)(2), for varying these proposed regula-
tions from the Department of Labor regula-
tions. The Board reconsidered comments 
submitted in response to the Notice of Pro-
posed Rulemaking in 2004 and now agrees 
that subsections that refer to occupations 
that do not apply in any manner to the Con-
gressional branch, e.g., § 541.101—Business 
owner and Subpart F—Outside Sales Em-
ployees, should not be retained as part of the 
regulations adopted and/or approved for the 
Legislative branch. Substantive Regulations 
that are focused solely on occupations exist-
ing within the Legislative Branch would be 
more effective for the implementation of the 
rights and protections under this section. As 
a result, these sections are delineated with 
bold brackets in this Notice. 
Why are there separate sets of existing 
FLSA regulations for the House of Represent-
atives, the Senate, and the other employing 
offices covered by the CAA? 
Section 304(a)(2)(B) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1384(a)(2)(B), requires that the substantive 
rules of the Board of Directors ‘‘shall consist 
of 3 separate bodies of regulations, which 
shall apply, respectively, to—(i) the Senate 
and employees of the Senate; (ii) the House 
of Representatives and employees of the 
House of Representatives; and (iii) the other 
covered employees and employing offices.’’ 
In 1996, the House of Representatives (H. Res. 
400) and the Senate (S. Res. 242) each adopted 
by resolution the FLSA regulations applica-
ble to each body. The Senate and House of 
Representatives adopted by concurrent reso-
lution (S. Con. Res. 51) the regulations appli-
cable to other employing offices and employ-
ees. 
Are there substantive differences in the 
proposed regulations for the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Senate, and the other em-
ploying offices? 
No. While there are some differences in 
other parts of the existing FLSA regulations 
applicable to the Senate, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the other employing offices 
(chiefly related to the mandate at section 
203(c)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1313(c)(3), re-
garding ‘‘covered employees whose work 
schedules directly depend on the schedule of 
the House of Representatives or the Senate 
. . .’’), the Board of Directors has identified 
no ‘‘good cause’’ for varying the text of these 
regulations. Therefore, if the proposed part 
541 regulations are adopted, the prefixes 
‘‘H’’, ‘‘S’’, and ‘‘C’’ will be affixed to each of 
the sets of regulations for the House, for the 
Senate, and for the other employing offices, 
but the text of the part 541 regulations will 
be identical. 
How are substantive regulations proposed 
and approved under the CAA? 
Section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1313(c)(2), requires that the Board of Direc-
tors propose substantive regulations imple-
menting the FLSA overtime requirements 
which are ‘‘the same as substantive regula-
tions promulgated by the Secretary of Labor 
to implement the statutory provisions . . .

except insofar as the Board may determine, 
for good cause shown and stated together 
with the regulation, that a modification of 
such regulation would be more effective for 
the implementation of the rights and protec-
tions under this section.’’ Pursuant to sec-
tion 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, the proce-
dure for promulgating such substantive regu-
lations requires that: (1) the Board of Direc-
tors adopt proposed substantive regulations 
and publish a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the Congressional Record; (2) 
there be a comment period of at least 30 days 
after the date of publication of the general 
notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) after con-
sideration of comments by the Board of Di-
rectors, that the Board adopt regulations 
and transmit notice of such action together 
with the regulations and a recommendation 
regarding the method for Congressional ap-
proval of the regulations to the Speaker of 
the House and President pro tempore of the 
Senate for publication in the Congressional 
Record; (4) committee referral and action on 
the proposed regulations by resolution in 
each House, concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution; and (5) final publication of 
the approved regulations in the Congres-
sional Record, with an effective date pre-
scribed in the final publication. For more de-
tail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. 
1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
step (1) of the outline set forth above. Unless 
and until all of the steps of the outline set 
forth above are completed, all employing of-
fices and covered employees continue to be 
required to follow the existing 1996 Sub-
stantive Regulations thereby denying many 
Legislative Branch employees of overtime 
benefits that they would likely be entitled to 
pursuant to the current Department of 
Labor overtime regulations. 
How does the Board of Directors rec-
ommend that Congress approve these pro-
posed regulations? 
Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1384(b)(4), the Board of Directors is re-
quired to ‘‘include a recommendation in the 
general notice of proposed rulemaking and in 
the regulations as to whether the regula-
tions should be approved by resolution of the 
Senate, by resolution of the House of Rep-
resentatives, by concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution.’’ The Board of Directors 
recommends that the procedure used in 1996 
be used to adopt these proposed overtime ex-
emption regulations: the House of Represent-
atives adopted the ‘‘H’’ version of the regula-
tions by resolution; the Senate adopted the 
‘‘S’’ version of the regulations by resolution; 
and the House and Senate adopted the ‘‘C’’ 
version of the regulations applied to the 
other employing offices by a concurrent res-
olution. 
Are these proposed regulations also rec-
ommended by the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights’ Executive Director, the 
Deputy Executive Director for the House of 
Representatives, and the Deputy Executive 
Director for the Senate? 
Yes, as required by section 304(b)(1) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1), the substance of 
these regulations is also recommended by 
the Executive Director and Deputy Execu-
tive Directors of the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights. 
How similar are the proposed CAA regula-
tions with the current Secretary of Labor 
regulations? 
Except for certain required changes to 
refer to the Legislative Branch instead of the 
Executive Branch, which are shown in the 
accompanying 
proposed 
regulations, 
the 
Board of Directors has repeated the text of 
the regulations at 29 CFR Part 541 verbatim. 
‘‘Good cause’’ for modification of the exist-
ing regulations of the Secretary of Labor, as 
required by section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1313(c)(2), consists of those changes 
needed to reflect the authority of the CAA as 
the enabling statute for these regulations, 
the requirement at section 225(d)(3) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1361(d)(3), that the CAA ’’shall 
not be construed to authorize enforcement 
by the executive branch of this Act. . . .’’. If 
there is any additional good cause for a par-
ticular proposed variation from the Sec-
retary of Labor’s regulations, it is set out 
adjacent to that provision of the proposed 
regulation. 
Are these proposed CAA regulations avail-
able to persons with disabilities in an alter-
nate format? 
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
available on the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights’ web site, www.ocwr.gov 
which is compliant with section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 
U.S.C. 794(d). This Notice can also be made 
available in large print, Braille, or other al-
ternative format. Requests for this Notice in 
an alternative format should be made via 
email to: adaaccess@ocwr.gov. 
30-DAY COMMENT PERIOD REGARDING THE 
PROPOSED REGULATIONS 
How can I submit comments regarding the 
proposed regulations? 
Comments regarding the proposed new 
overtime exemption regulations of the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights set forth 
in this NOTICE are invited for a period of 
thirty (30) days following the date of the ap-
pearance of this NOTICE in the Congres-
sional Record. Submission of comments 
must be made in writing to the Executive Di-
rector, Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights, 
via 
email 
at 
rule- 
comments@ocwr.gov. Copies of submitted 
comments will be available for review on the 
Office’s web site at www.ocwr.gov. 
Supplementary Information: 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (CAA), PL 10–91, was enacted into law on 
January 23, 1995. The CAA applies the rights 
and protections of 12 federal labor and em-
ployment statutes to covered employees and 
employing offices within the Legislative 
Branch of Government. Section 301 of the 
CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381), as amended, establishes 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
as an independent office within the Legisla-
tive Branch. 
HOW TO READ THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS 
The text of the proposed amendments re-
produces the text of the current regulations 
promulgated by the Secretary of Labor at 29 
CFR Part 541, and shows changes proposed 
for the CAA version of these same regula-
tions. Changes proposed by the Board of Di-
rectors of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights are shown as follows: deletions 
are marked with a [bracket] and added text 
is bolded within angled <<brackets>>. There-
fore, if these regulations are approved as pro-
posed, the deletion within bracketed text 
will disappear from the regulations and the 
added text within angled brackets will re-
main but not in bold. If these regulations are 
approved for the House of Representatives by 
resolution of the House, they will be promul-
gated with the prefix ‘‘H’’ appearing before 
each regulations section number. If these 
regulations are approved for the Senate by 
resolution of the Senate, they will be pro-
mulgated with the prefix ‘‘S’’ appearing be-
fore each regulations section number. If 
these regulations are approved for the other 
employing offices by joint or concurrent res-
olution of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate, they will be promulgated with 
the prefix ‘‘C’’ appearing before each regula-
tions section number.

tive, or professional capacity (including any

elementary or secondary schools)ø, or in the 
capacity of an outside sales employee, as 
such terms are defined and delimited from 
time to time by regulations of the Secretary, 
subject to the provisions of the Administra-
tive Procedure Act.¿ Section 13(a)(17) of the 
Act provides an exemption from the min-
imum wage and overtime requirements for 
computer systems analysts, computer pro-
grammers, software engineers, and other 
similarly skilled computer employees. 
(b) The requirements for these exemptions 
are contained in this part as follows: execu-
tive employees, subpart B; administrative 
employees, subpart C; professional employ-
ees, subpart D; computer employees, subpart 
Eø; outside sales employees, subpart F¿. Sub-
part G contains regulations regarding salary 
requirements applicable to most of the ex-
emptions, including salary levels and the sal-
ary basis test. Subpart G also contains a pro-
vision for exempting certain highly com-
pensated employees. Subpart H contains 
definitions and other miscellaneous provi-
sions applicable to all or several of the ex-
emptions. 
(c) Effective July 1, 1972, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act was amended to include with-
in the protection of the equal pay provisions 
those employees exempt from the minimum 
wage and overtime pay provisions as bona 
fide executive, administrative, and profes-
sional employees (including any employee 
employed in the capacity of academic admin-
istrative personnel or teacher in elementary 
or secondary schools)ø, or in the capacity of 
an outside sales employee under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act¿. The equal pay provisions 
in section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act are administered and enforced by the 
øUnited States Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission¿ <<Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights>>. 
§ 541.1 Terms used in regulations. 
Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938, as amended. 
øAdministrator means the Administrator 
of the Wage and Hour Division, United 
States Department of Labor. The Secretary 
of Labor has delegated to the Administrator 
the functions vested in the Secretary under-
sections 13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act.¿ <<CAA means Con-
gressional Accountability Act of 1995, as 
amended. Office means the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights. Employee means a 
‘‘covered employee’’ as defined in section 
101(3) through (8) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1301(3) 
through (8), but not an ‘‘intern’’ as defined in

203(a)(2) 
of 
the 
CAA, 
2 
U.S.C. 
1313(a)(2). Employer, company, business, or 
enterprise each mean an ‘‘employing office’’ 
as defined in section 101(9) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1301(9).>> 
§ 541.2 Job titles insufficient. 
A job title alone is insufficient to establish 
the exempt status of an employee. The ex-
empt or nonexempt status of any particular 
employee must be determined on the basis of 
whether the employee’s salary and duties 
meet the requirements of the regulations in 
this part. 
§ 541.3 Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemp-
tions. 
(a) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the 
regulations in this part do not apply to man-
ual laborers or other ‘‘blue collar’’ workers 
who perform work involving repetitive oper-
ations with their hands, physical skill and 
energy. Such nonexempt ‘‘blue collar’’ em-
ployees gain the skills and knowledge re-
quired for performance of their routine man-
ual and physical work through apprentice-
ships and on-the-job training, not through 
the prolonged course of specialized intellec-
tual instruction required for exempt learned 
professional employees such as medical doc-
tors, architects and archeologists. Thus, for 
example, non-management production-line 
employees and non-management employees 
in maintenance, construction and similar oc-
cupations such as carpenters, electricians, 
mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, crafts-
men, operating engineers, longshoremen, 
construction workers and laborers are enti-
tled to minimum wage and overtime pre-
mium pay under the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, and are not exempt under the regula-
tions in this part no matter how highly paid 
they might be. 
(b)(1) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and 
the regulations in this part also do not apply 
to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, 
state troopers, highway patrol officers, in-
vestigators, inspectors, correctional officers, 
parole or probation officers, park rangers, 
fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical 
technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue 
workers, hazardous materials workers and 
similar employees, regardless of rank or pay 
level, who perform work such as preventing, 
controlling or extinguishing fires of any 
type; rescuing fire, crime or accident vic-
tims; preventing or detecting crimes; con-
ducting investigations or inspections for vio-
lations of law; performing surveillance; pur-
suing, restraining and apprehending sus-
pects; detaining or supervising suspected and 
convicted criminals, including those on pro-
bation or parole; interviewing witnesses; in-
terrogating and fingerprinting suspects; pre-
paring investigative reports; or other similar 
work. 
(2) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt executive employees because their pri-
mary duty is not management of the enter-
prise in which the employee is employed or a 
customarily recognized department or sub-
division thereof as required under § 541.100. 
Thus, for example, a police officer or fire 
fighter whose primary duty is to investigate 
crimes or fight fires is not exempt under sec-
tion 13(a)(1) of the Act merely because the 
police officer or fire fighter also directs the 
work of other employees in the conduct of an 
investigation or fighting a fire. 
(3) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt 
administrative 
employees 
because 
their primary duty is not the performance of 
work directly related to the management or 
general business operations of the employer 
or the employer’s customers as required 
under § 541.200. 
(4) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt professionals because their primary 
duty is not the performance of work requir-
ing knowledge of an advanced type in a field 
of science or learning customarily acquired 
by a prolonged course of specialized intellec-
tual instruction or the performance of work 
requiring invention, imagination, originality 
or talent in a recognized field of artistic or 
creative endeavor as required under § 541.300. 
Although some police officers, fire fighters, 
paramedics, emergency medical technicians 
and similar employees have college degrees, 
a specialized academic degree is not a stand-
ard prerequisite for employment in such oc-
cupations. 
§ 541.4 Other laws and collective bargaining 
agreements. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act provides 
minimum standards that may be exceeded, 
but cannot be waived or reduced. Employers 
must comply, for example, with any Federal, 
State or municipal laws, regulations or ordi-
nances establishing a higher minimum wage 
or lower maximum workweek than those es-
tablished under the Act. Similarly, employ-
ers, on their own initiative or under a collec-
tive bargaining agreement with a labor 
union, are not precluded by the Act from 
providing a wage higher than the statutory 
minimum, a shorter workweek than the stat-
utory maximum, or a higher overtime pre-
mium (double time, for example) than pro-
vided by the Act. While collective bargaining 
agreements cannot waive or reduce the Act’s 
protections, nothing in the Act or the regu-
lations in this part relieves employers from 
their contractual obligations under collec-
tive bargaining agreements. 
SUBPART 
B—EXECUTIVE 
EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.100–541.106) 
§ 541.100 General rule for executive employ-
ees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide executive capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Compensated on a salary basis pursuant 
to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 per 
week ø(or $455 per week if employed in the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands by employers other than the Federal 
government, or $380 per week if employed in 
American Samoa by employers other than 
the 
Federal 
government)¿, 
exclusive 
of 
board, lodging or other facilities; 
(2) Whose primary duty is management of 
the enterprise in which the employee is em-
ployed or of a customarily recognized depart-
ment or subdivision thereof; 
(3) Who customarily and regularly directs 
the work of two or more other employees; 
and 
(4) Who has the authority to hire or fire 
other employees or whose suggestions and 
recommendations as to the hiring, firing, ad-
vancement, promotion or any other change 
of status of other employees are given par-
ticular weight. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ 
is defined at § 541.606; ‘‘primary duty’’ is de-
fined at § 541.700; and ‘‘customarily and regu-
larly’’ is defined at § 541.701. 
ø§ 541.101 Business owner. 
The term ‘‘employee employed in a bona 
fide executive capacity’’ in section 13(a)(1) of 
the Act also includes any employee who 
owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity 
interest in the enterprise in which the em-
ployee is employed, regardless of whether 
the business is a corporate or other type of 
organization, and who is actively engaged in 
its management. The term ‘‘management’’ is 
defined in § 541.102. The requirements of Sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do 
not apply to the business owners described in 
this section.¿ 
§ 541.102 Management. 
Generally, ‘‘management’’ includes, but is 
not limited to, activities such as inter-
viewing, selecting, and training of employ-
ees; setting and adjusting their rates of pay 
and hours of work; directing the work of em-
ployees; maintaining production or sales 
records for use in supervision or control; ap-
praising employees’ productivity and effi-
ciency for the purpose of recommending pro-
motions or other changes in status; handling 
employee complaints and grievances; dis-
ciplining employees; planning the work; de-
termining the techniques to be used; appor-
tioning the work among the employees; de-
termining the type of materials, supplies, 
machinery, equipment or tools to be used or 
merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; 
controlling the flow and distribution of ma-
terials or merchandise and supplies; pro-
viding for the safety and security of the em-
ployees or the property; planning and con-
trolling the budget; and monitoring or im-
plementing legal compliance measures. 
§ 541.103 Department or subdivision. 
(a) The phrase ‘‘a customarily recognized 
department or subdivision’’ is intended to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

April 26, 2022 
distinguish between a mere collection of em-
ployees assigned from time to time to a spe-
cific job or series of jobs and a unit with per-
manent status and function. A customarily 
recognized department or subdivision must 
have a permanent status and a continuing 
function. For example, a large employer’s 
human resources department might have 
subdivisions for labor relations, pensions and 
other benefits, equal employment oppor-
tunity, and personnel management, each of 
which has a permanent status and function. 
(b) When an enterprise has more than one 
establishment, the employee in charge of 
each establishment may be considered in 
charge of a recognized subdivision of the en-
terprise. 
(c) A recognized department or subdivision 
need not be physically within the employer’s 
establishment and may move from place to 
place. The mere fact that the employee 
works in more than one location does not in-
validate the exemption if other factors show 
that the employee is actually in charge of a 
recognized unit with a continuing function 
in the organization. 
(d) Continuity of the same subordinate per-
sonnel is not essential to the existence of a 
recognized unit with a continuing function. 
An otherwise exempt employee will not lose 
the exemption merely because the employee 
draws and supervises workers from a pool or 
supervises a team of workers drawn from 
other recognized units, if other factors are 
present that indicate that the employee is in 
charge of a recognized unit with a con-
tinuing function. 
§ 541.104 Two or more other employees. 
(a) To qualify as an exempt executive 
under § 541.100, the employee must custom-
arily and regularly direct the work of two or 
more other employees. The phrase ‘‘two or 
more other employees’’ means two full-time 
employees or their equivalent. One full-time 
and two half-time employees, for example, 
are equivalent to two full-time employees. 
Four half-time employees are also equiva-
lent. 
(b) The supervision can be distributed 
among two, three or more employees, but 
each such employee must customarily and 
regularly direct the work of two or more 
other full-time employees or the equivalent. 
Thus, for example, a department with five 
full-time nonexempt workers may have up to 
two exempt supervisors if each such super-
visor customarily and regularly directs the 
work of two of those workers. 
(c) An employee who merely assists the 
manager of a particular department and su-
pervises two or more employees only in the 
actual manager’s absence does not meet this 
requirement. 
(d) Hours worked by an employee cannot 
be credited more than once for different ex-
ecutives. Thus, a shared responsibility for 
the supervision of the same two employees in 
the same department does not satisfy this 
requirement. However, a full-time employee 
who works four hours for one supervisor and 
four hours for a different supervisor, for ex-
ample, can be credited as a half-time em-
ployee for both supervisors. 
§ 541.105 Particular weight. 
To determine whether an employee’s sug-
gestions and recommendations are given 
‘‘particular weight,’’ factors to be considered 
include, but are not limited to, whether it is 
part of the employee’s job duties to make 
such suggestions and recommendations; the 
frequency with which such suggestions and 
recommendations are made or requested; and 
the frequency with which the employee’s 
suggestions and recommendations are relied 
upon. Generally, an executive’s suggestions 
and recommendations must pertain to em-
ployees whom the executive customarily and 
regularly directs. It does not include an oc-
casional suggestion with regard to the 
change in status of a co-worker. An employ-
ee’s suggestions and recommendations may 
still be deemed to have ‘‘particular weight’’ 
even 
if 
a 
higher 
level 
manager’s 
rec-
ommendation has more importance and even 
if the employee does not have authority to 
make the ultimate decision as to the em-
ployee’s change in status. 
§ 541.106 Concurrent duties. 
(a) Concurrent performance of exempt and 
nonexempt work does not disqualify an em-
ployee from the executive exemption if the 
requirements of § 541.100 are otherwise met. 
Whether an employee meets the require-
ments of § 541.100 when the employee per-
forms concurrent duties is determined on a 
case-by-case basis and based on the factors 
set forth in § 541.700. Generally, exempt ex-
ecutives make the decision regarding when 
to perform nonexempt duties and remain re-
sponsible for the success or failure of busi-
ness operations under their management 
while performing the nonexempt work. In 
contrast, the nonexempt employee generally 
is directed by a supervisor to perform the ex-
empt work or performs the exempt work for 
defined time periods. An employee whose pri-
mary duty is ordinary production work or 
routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot 
qualify for exemption as an executive. 
(b) For example, an assistant manager in a 
retail establishment may perform work such 
as serving customers, cooking food, stocking 
shelves and cleaning the establishment, but 
performance of such nonexempt work does 
not preclude the exemption if the assistant 
manager’s primary duty is management. An 
assistant manager can supervise employees 
and serve customers at the same time with-
out losing the exemption. An exempt em-
ployee can also simultaneously direct the 
work of other employees and stock shelves. 
(c) In contrast, a relief supervisor or work-
ing supervisor whose primary duty is per-
forming nonexempt work on the production 
line in a manufacturing plant does not be-
come exempt merely because the nonexempt 
production line employee occasionally has 
some responsibility for directing the work of 
other nonexempt production line employees 
when, for example, the exempt supervisor is 
unavailable. Similarly, an employee whose 
primary duty is to work as an electrician is 
not an exempt executive even if the em-
ployee also directs the work of other employ-
ees on the job site, orders parts and mate-

SUBPART C—ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOY-
EES (§§ 541.200–541.204) 
§ 541.200 General rule for administrative em-
ployees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide administrative capacity’’ in sec-
tion 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any em-
ployee: 
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis 
pursuant to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than 
$684 per week ø(or $455 per week if employed 
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands by employers other than the 
Federal government, or $380 per week if em-
ployed in American Samoa by employers 
other than the Federal government)¿, exclu-
sive of board, lodging or other facilities; 
(2) Whose primary duty is the performance 
of office or non-manual work directly related 
to the management or general business oper-
ations of the employer or the employer’s cus-
tomers; and 
(3) Whose primary duty includes the exer-
cise of discretion and independent judgment 
with respect to matters of significance. 
(b) The term ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘fee basis’’ is defined at § 541.605; 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.201 Directly related to management or 
general business operations. 
(a) To qualify for the administrative ex-
emption, an employee’s primary duty must 
be the performance of work directly related 
to the management or general business oper-
ations of the employer or the employer’s cus-
tomers. The phrase ‘‘directly related to the 
management or general business operations’’ 
refers to the type of work performed by the 
employee. To meet this requirement, an em-
ployee must perform work directly related to 
assisting with the running or servicing of the 
business, as distinguished, for example, from 
working on a manufacturing production line 
or selling a product in a retail or service es-
tablishment. 
(b) Work directly related to management 
or general business operations includes, but 
is not limited to, work in functional areas 
such as tax; finance; accounting; budgeting; 
auditing; insurance; quality control; pur-
chasing; 
procurement; 
advertising; 
mar-
keting; research; safety and health; per-
sonnel management; human resources; em-
ployee benefits; labor relations; public rela-
tions, government relations; computer net-
work, internet and database administration; 
legal and regulatory compliance; and similar 
activities. Some of these activities may be 
performed by employees who also would 
qualify for another exemption. 
(c) An employee may qualify for the ad-
ministrative exemption if the employee’s 
primary duty is the performance of work di-
rectly related to the management or general 
business operations of the employer’s cus-
tomers. Thus, for example, employees acting 
as advisers or consultants to their employ-
er’s clients or customers (as tax experts or 
financial consultants, for example) may be 
exempt. 
§ 541.202 Discretion and independent judg-
ment. 
(a) To qualify for the administrative ex-
emption, an employee’s primary duty must 
include the exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment with respect to matters of 
significance. In general, the exercise of dis-
cretion and independent judgment involves 
the comparison and the evaluation of pos-
sible courses of conduct, and acting or mak-
ing a decision after the various possibilities 
have been considered. The term ‘‘matters of 
significance’’ refers to the level of impor-
tance or consequence of the work performed. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘discretion and independent 
judgment’’ must be applied in the light of all 
the facts involved in the particular employ-
ment situation in which the question arises. 
Factors 
to 
consider 
when 
determining 
whether an employee exercises discretion 
and independent judgment with respect to 
matters of significance include, but are not 
limited to: whether the employee has au-
thority to formulate, affect, interpret, or im-
plement management policies or operating 
practices; whether the employee carries out 
major assignments in conducting the oper-
ations of the business; whether the employee 
performs work that affects business oper-
ations to a substantial degree, even if the 
employee’s assignments are related to oper-
ation of a particular segment of the business; 
whether the employee has authority to com-
mit the employer in matters that have sig-
nificant financial impact; whether the em-
ployee has authority to waive or deviate 
from established policies and procedures 
without prior approval; whether the em-
ployee has authority to negotiate and bind 
the company on significant matters; whether 
the employee provides consultation or expert 
advice to management; whether the em-
ployee is involved in planning long- or short-

term business objectives; whether the em-
ployee investigates and resolves matters of 
significance on behalf of management; and 
whether the employee represents the com-
pany in handling complaints, arbitrating dis-
putes or resolving grievances. 
(c) The exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment implies that the employee 
has authority to make an independent 
choice, free from immediate direction or su-
pervision. However, employees can exercise 
discretion and independent judgment even if 
their decisions or recommendations are re-
viewed at a higher level. Thus, the term 
‘‘discretion and independent judgment’’ does 
not require that the decisions made by an 
employee have a finality that goes with un-
limited authority and a complete absence of 
review. The decisions made as a result of the 
exercise of discretion and independent judg-
ment may consist of recommendations for 
action rather than the actual taking of ac-
tion. The fact that an employee’s decision 
may be subject to review and that upon occa-
sion the decisions are revised or reversed 
after review does not mean that the em-
ployee is not exercising discretion and inde-
pendent judgment. For example, the policies 
formulated by the credit manager of a large 
corporation may be subject to review by 
higher company officials who may approve 
or disapprove these policies. The manage-
ment consultant who has made a study of 
the operations of a business and who has 
drawn a proposed change in organization 
may have the plan reviewed or revised by su-
periors before it is submitted to the client. 
(d) An employer’s volume of business may 
make it necessary to employ a number of 
employees to perform the same or similar 
work. The fact that many employees perform 
identical work or work of the same relative 
importance does not mean that the work of 
each such employee does not involve the ex-
ercise of discretion and independent judg-
ment with respect to matters of significance. 
(e) The exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment must be more than the use 
of skill in applying well-established tech-
niques, procedures or specific standards de-
scribed in manuals or other sources. See also 
§ 541.704 regarding use of manuals. The exer-
cise of discretion and independent judgment 
also does not include clerical or secretarial 
work, recording or tabulating data, or per-
forming other mechanical, repetitive, recur-
rent or routine work. An employee who sim-
ply tabulates data is not exempt, even if la-
beled as a ‘‘statistician.’’ 
(f) An employee does not exercise discre-
tion and independent judgment with respect 
to matters of significance merely because 
the employer will experience financial losses 
if the employee fails to perform the job prop-
erly. For example, a messenger who is en-
trusted with carrying large sums of money 
does not exercise discretion and independent 
judgment with respect to matters of signifi-
cance even though serious consequences may 
flow from the employee’s neglect. Similarly, 
an employee who operates very expensive 
equipment does not exercise discretion and 
independent judgment with respect to mat-
ters of significance merely because improper 
performance of the employee’s duties may 
cause serious financial loss to the employer. 
§ 541.203 Administrative exemption examples. 
(a) Insurance claims adjusters generally 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption, whether they work for 
an insurance company or other type of com-
pany, if their duties include activities such 
as interviewing insureds, witnesses and phy-
sicians; inspecting property damage; review-
ing factual information to prepare damage 
estimates; 
evaluating 
and 
making 
rec-
ommendations regarding coverage of claims; 
determining liability and total value of a 
claim; negotiating settlements; and making 
recommendations regarding litigation. 
(b) Employees in the financial services in-
dustry generally meet the duties require-
ments for the administrative exemption if 
their duties include work such as collecting 
and analyzing information regarding the cus-
tomer’s 
income, 
assets, 
investments 
or 
debts; determining which financial products 
best meet the customer’s needs and financial 
circumstances; advising the customer re-
garding the advantages and disadvantages of 
different financial products; and marketing, 
servicing or promoting the employer’s finan-
cial products. However, an employee whose 
primary duty is selling financial products 
does not qualify for the administrative ex-
emption. 
(c) An employee who leads a team of other 
employees 
assigned 
to 
complete 
major 
projects for the employer (such as pur-
chasing, selling or closing all or part of the 
business, negotiating a real estate trans-
action or a collective bargaining agreement, 
or designing and implementing productivity 
improvements) generally meets the duties 
requirements for the administrative exemp-
tion, even if the employee does not have di-
rect supervisory responsibility over the 
other employees on the team. 
(d) An executive assistant or administra-
tive assistant to a business owner or senior 
executive of a large business generally meets 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption if such employee, without 
specific instructions or prescribed proce-
dures, has been delegated authority regard-
ing matters of significance. 
(e) Human resources managers who formu-
late, interpret or implement employment 
policies and management consultants who 
study the operations of a business and pro-
pose changes in organization generally meet 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption. However, personnel clerks 
who ‘‘screen’’ applicants to obtain data re-
garding their minimum qualifications and 
fitness for employment generally do not 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption. Such personnel clerks 
typically will reject all applicants who do 
not meet minimum standards for the par-
ticular job or for employment by the com-
pany. The minimum standards are usually 
set by the exempt human resources manager 
or other company officials, and the decision 
to hire from the group of qualified applicants 
who do meet the minimum standards is simi-
larly made by the exempt human resources 
manager or other company officials. Thus, 
when the interviewing and screening func-
tions are performed by the human resources 
manager or personnel manager who makes 
the hiring decision or makes recommenda-
tions for hiring from the pool of qualified ap-
plicants, such duties constitute exempt 
work, even though routine, because this 
work is directly and closely related to the 
employee’s exempt functions. 
(f) Purchasing agents with authority to 
bind the company on significant purchases 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption even if they 
must consult with top management officials 
when making a purchase commitment for 
raw materials in excess of the contemplated 
plant needs. 
(g) Ordinary inspection work generally 
does not meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption. Inspectors 
normally perform specialized work along 
standardized lines involving well-established 
techniques and procedures which may have 
been catalogued and described in manuals or 
other sources. Such inspectors rely on tech-
niques and skills acquired by special training 
or experience. They have some leeway in the 
performance of their work but only within 
closely prescribed limits. 
(h) Employees usually called examiners or 
graders, such as employees that grade lum-
ber, generally do not meet the duties re-
quirements for the administrative exemp-
tion. Such employees usually perform work 
involving the comparison of products with 
established standards which are frequently 
catalogued. Often, after continued reference 
to the written standards, or through experi-
ence, 
the 
employee 
acquires 
sufficient 
knowledge so that reference to written 
standards is unnecessary. The substitution 
of the employee’s memory for a manual of 
standards does not convert the character of 
the work performed to exempt work requir-
ing the exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment. 
(i) Comparison shopping performed by an 
employee of a retail store who merely re-
ports to the buyer the prices at a competi-
tor’s store does not qualify for the adminis-
trative exemption. However, the buyer who 
evaluates such reports on competitor prices 
to set the employer’s prices generally meets 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption. 
(j) Public sector inspectors or investigators 
of various types, such as fire prevention or 
safety, building or construction, health or 
sanitation, environmental or soils specialists 
and similar employees, generally do not 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption because their work typi-
cally does not involve work directly related 
to the management or general business oper-
ations of the employer. Such employees also 
do not qualify for the administrative exemp-
tion because their work involves the use of 
skills and technical abilities in gathering 
factual information, applying known stand-
ards or prescribed procedures, determining 
which procedure to follow, or determining 
whether prescribed standards or criteria are 
met. 
§ 541.204 Educational establishments. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide administrative capacity’’ in sec-
tion 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes employ-
ees: 
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis at 
a rate of not less than $684 per week ø(or $455 
per week if employed in the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by 
employers other than the Federal govern-
ment, or $380 per week if employed in Amer-
ican Samoa by employers other than the 
Federal government)¿, exclusive of board, 
lodging, or other facilities; or on a salary 
basis which is at least equal to the entrance 
salary for teachers in the educational estab-
lishment by which employed; and 
(2) Whose primary duty is performing ad-
ministrative functions directly related to 
academic instruction or training in an edu-
cational establishment or department or 
subdivision thereof. 
(b) The term ‘‘educational establishment’’ 
means an elementary or secondary school 
system, an institution of higher education or 
other educational institution. Sections 3(v) 
and 3(w) of the Act define elementary and 
secondary schools as those day or residential 
schools that provide elementary or sec-
ondary education, as determined under State 
law. Under the laws of most States, such 
education includes the curriculums in grades 
1 through 12; under many it includes also the 
introductory 
programs 
in 
kindergarten. 
Such education in some States may also in-
clude nursery school programs in elementary 
education and junior college curriculums in 
secondary education. The term ‘‘other edu-
cational 
establishment’’ 
includes 
special 
schools for mentally or physically disabled

or gifted children, regardless of any classi-
fication of such schools as elementary, sec-
ondary or higher. Factors relevant in deter-
mining whether post-secondary career pro-
grams are educational institutions include 
whether the school is licensed by a state 
agency responsible for the state’s edu-
cational system or accredited by a nation-
ally recognized accrediting organization for 
career schools. Also, for purposes of the ex-
emption, no distinction is drawn between 
public and private schools, or between those 
operated for profit and those that are not for 
profit. 
(c) The phrase ‘‘performing administrative 
functions directly related to academic in-
struction or training’’ means work related to 
the academic operations and functions in a 
school rather than to administration along 
the lines of general business operations. 
Such academic administrative functions in-
clude operations directly in the field of edu-
cation. Jobs relating to areas outside the 
educational field are not within the defini-
tion of academic administration. 
(1) Employees engaged in academic admin-
istrative 
functions 
include: 
the 
super-
intendent or other head of an elementary or 
secondary school system, and any assistants, 
responsible for administration of such mat-
ters as curriculum, quality and methods of 
instructing, measuring and testing the learn-
ing potential and achievement of students, 
establishing and maintaining academic and 
grading standards, and other aspects of the 
teaching program; the principal and any 
vice-principals responsible for the operation 
of an elementary or secondary school; de-
partment heads in institutions of higher edu-
cation responsible for the administration of 
the mathematics department, the English 
department, the foreign language depart-
ment, etc.; academic counselors who perform 
work such as administering school testing 
programs, assisting students with academic 
problems and advising students concerning 
degree requirements; and other employees 
with similar responsibilities. 
(2) Jobs relating to building management 
and maintenance, jobs relating to the health 
of the students, and academic staff such as 
social workers, psychologists, lunch room 
managers or dietitians do not perform aca-
demic administrative functions. Although 
such work is not considered academic admin-
istration, such employees may qualify for ex-
emption under § 541.200or under other sec-
tions of this part, provided the requirements 
for such exemptions are met. 
SUBPART D—PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.300–541.304) 
§ 541.300 General rule for professional em-
ployees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis 
pursuant to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than 
$684 per week ø(or $455 per week if employed 
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands by employers other than the 
Federal government, or $380 per week if em-
ployed in American Samoa by employers 
other than the Federal government)¿, exclu-
sive of board, lodging or other facilities; and 
(2) Whose primary duty is the performance 
of work: 
(i) Requiring knowledge of an advanced 
type in a field of science or learning custom-
arily acquired by a prolonged course of spe-
cialized intellectual instruction; or 
(ii) Requiring invention, imagination, orig-
inality or talent in a recognized field of ar-
tistic or creative endeavor. 
(b) The term ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘fee basis’’ is defined at § 541.605; 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.301 Learned professionals. 
(a) To qualify for the learned professional 
exemption, an employee’s primary duty 
must be the performance of work requiring 
advanced knowledge in a field of science or 
learning customarily acquired by a pro-
longed course of specialized intellectual in-
struction. This primary duty test includes 
three elements: 
(1) The employee must perform work re-
quiring advanced knowledge; 
(2) The advanced knowledge must be in a 
field of science or learning; and 
(3) The advanced knowledge must be cus-
tomarily acquired by a prolonged course of 
specialized intellectual instruction. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘work requiring advanced 
knowledge’’ means work which is predomi-
nantly intellectual in character, and which 
includes work requiring the consistent exer-
cise of discretion and judgment, as distin-
guished from performance of routine mental, 
manual, mechanical or physical work. An 
employee who performs work requiring ad-
vanced knowledge generally uses the ad-
vanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or 
make deductions from varying facts or cir-
cumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be 
attained at the high school level. 
(c) The phrase ‘‘field of science or learn-
ing’’ includes the traditional professions of 
law, medicine, theology, accounting, actu-
arial computation, engineering, architec-
ture, teaching, various types of physical, 
chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy 
and other similar occupations that have a 
recognized professional status as distin-
guished from the mechanical arts or skilled 
trades where in some instances the knowl-
edge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not 
in a field of science or learning. 
(d) The phrase ‘‘customarily acquired by a 
prolonged course of specialized intellectual 
instruction’’ restricts the exemption to pro-
fessions where specialized academic training 
is a standard prerequisite for entrance into 
the profession. The best prima facie evidence 
that an employee meets this requirement is 
possession of the appropriate academic de-
gree. However, the word ‘‘customarily’’ 
means that the exemption is also available 
to employees in such professions who have 
substantially the same knowledge level and 
perform substantially the same work as the 
degreed employees, but who attained the ad-
vanced knowledge through a combination of 
work experience and intellectual instruc-
tion. Thus, for example, the learned profes-
sional exemption is available to the occa-
sional lawyer who has not gone to law 
school, or the occasional chemist who is not 
the possessor of a degree in chemistry. How-
ever, the learned professional exemption is 
not available for occupations that custom-
arily may be performed with only the gen-
eral knowledge acquired by an academic de-
gree in any field, with knowledge acquired 
through an apprenticeship, or with training 
in the performance of routine mental, man-
ual, mechanical or physical processes. The 
learned professional exemption also does not 
apply to occupations in which most employ-
ees have acquired their skill by experience 
rather than by advanced specialized intellec-
tual instruction. 
(e)(1) Registered or certified medical tech-
nologists. Registered or certified medical 
technologists who have successfully com-
pleted three academic years of pre-profes-
sional study in an accredited college or uni-
versity plus a fourth year of professional 
course work in a school of medical tech-
nology approved by the Council of Medical 
Education of the American Medical Associa-
tion generally meet the duties requirements 
for the learned professional exemption. 
(2) Nurses. Registered nurses who are reg-
istered by the appropriate State examining 
board generally meet the duties require-
ments for the learned professional exemp-
tion. Licensed practical nurses and other 
similar health care employees, however, gen-
erally do not qualify as exempt learned pro-
fessionals because possession of a specialized 
advanced academic degree is not a standard 
prerequisite for entry into such occupations. 
(3) Dental hygienists. Dental hygienists 
who have successfully completed four aca-
demic years of pre-professional and profes-
sional study in an accredited college or uni-
versity approved by the Commission on Ac-
creditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary 
Educational Programs of the American Den-
tal Association generally meet the duties re-
quirements for the learned professional ex-
emption. 
(4) Physician assistants. Physician assist-
ants who have successfully completed four 
academic years of pre-professional and pro-
fessional study, including graduation from a 
physician assistant program accredited by 
the Accreditation Review Commission on 
Education for the Physician Assistant, and 
who are certified by the National Commis-
sion on Certification of Physician Assistants 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the learned professional exemption. 
(5) Accountants. Certified public account-
ants generally meet the duties requirements 
for the learned professional exemption. In 
addition, many other accountants who are 
not certified public accountants but perform 
similar job duties may qualify as exempt 
learned professionals. However, accounting 
clerks, bookkeepers and other employees 
who normally perform a great deal of routine 
work generally will not qualify as exempt 
professionals. 
(6) Chefs. Chefs, such as executive chefs 
and sous chefs, who have attained a four- 
year specialized academic degree in a cul-
inary arts program, generally meet the du-
ties requirements for the learned profes-
sional exemption. The learned professional 
exemption is not available to cooks who per-
form predominantly routine mental, manual, 
mechanical or physical work. 
(7) Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assist-
ants generally do not qualify as exempt 
learned professionals because an advanced 
specialized academic degree is not a standard 
prerequisite for entry into the field. Al-
though many paralegals possess general 
four-year advanced degrees, most specialized 
paralegal programs are two-year associate 
degree programs from a community college 
or 
equivalent 
institution. 
However, 
the 
learned professional exemption is available 
for paralegals who possess advanced special-
ized degrees in other professional fields and 
apply advanced knowledge in that field in 
the performance of their duties. For exam-
ple, if a law firm hires an engineer as a para-
legal to provide expert advice on product li-
ability cases or to assist on patent matters, 
that engineer would qualify for exemption. 
(8) Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who 
have successfully completed four academic 
years of pre-professional and professional 
study in a specialized curriculum accredited 
by the Commission on Accreditation of Al-
lied Health Education Programs and who are 
certified by the Board of Certification of the 
National 
Athletic 
Trainers 
Association 
Board of Certification generally meet the du-
ties requirements for the learned profes-
sional exemption. 
ø(9) Funeral directors or embalmers. Li-
censed funeral directors and embalmers who 
are licensed by and working in a state that 
requires successful completion of four aca-
demic years of pre-professional and profes-
sional study, including graduation from a

college of mortuary science accredited by 
the American Board of Funeral Service Edu-
cation, generally meet the duties require-
ments for the learned professional exemp-
tion.¿ 
(f) The areas in which the professional ex-
emption may be available are expanding. As 
knowledge is developed, academic training is 
broadened and specialized degrees are offered 
in new and diverse fields, thus creating new 
specialists in particular fields of science or 
learning. When an advanced specialized de-
gree has become a standard requirement for 
a particular occupation, that occupation 
may have acquired the characteristics of a 
learned profession. Accrediting and certi-
fying organizations similar to those listed in 
paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(8) of 
this section also may be created in the fu-
ture. Such organizations may develop simi-
lar specialized curriculums and certification 
programs which, if a standard requirement 
for a particular occupation, may indicate 
that the occupation has acquired the charac-
teristics of a learned profession. 
§ 541.302 Creative professionals. 
(a) To qualify for the creative professional 
exemption, an employee’s primary duty 
must be the performance of work requiring 
invention, imagination, originality or talent 
in a recognized field of artistic or creative 
endeavor as opposed to routine mental, man-
ual, mechanical or physical work. The ex-
emption does not apply to work which can be 
produced by a person with general manual or 
intellectual ability and training. 
(b) To qualify for exemption as a creative 
professional, the work performed must be 
‘‘in a recognized field of artistic or creative 
endeavor.’’ This includes such fields as 
music, writing, acting and the graphic arts. 
(c) The requirement of ‘‘invention, imagi-
nation, originality or talent’’ distinguishes 
the creative professions from work that pri-
marily depends on intelligence, diligence and 
accuracy. The duties of employees vary 
widely, and exemption as a creative profes-
sional depends on the extent of the inven-
tion, imagination, originality or talent exer-
cised by the employee. Determination of ex-
empt creative professional status, therefore, 
must be made on a case-by-case basis. This 
requirement generally is met by actors, mu-
sicians, composers, conductors, and soloists; 
painters who at most are given the subject 
matter of their painting; cartoonists who are 
merely told the title or underlying concept 
of a cartoon and must rely on their own cre-
ative ability to express the concept; essay-
ists, 
novelists, 
short-story 
writers 
and 
screen-play writers who choose their own 
subjects and hand in a finished piece of work 
to their employers (the majority of such per-
sons are, of course, not employees but self- 
employed); and persons holding the more re-
sponsible writing positions in advertising 
agencies. This requirement generally is not 
met by a person who is employed as a copy-
ist, as an ‘‘animator’’ of motion-picture car-
toons, or as a retoucher of photographs, 
since such work is not properly described as 
creative in character. 
(d) Journalists may satisfy the duties re-
quirements for the creative professional ex-
emption if their primary duty is work re-
quiring invention, imagination, originality 
or talent, as opposed to work which depends 
primarily on intelligence, diligence and ac-
curacy. Employees of newspapers, maga-
zines, television and other media are not ex-
empt creative professionals if they only col-
lect, organize and record information that is 
routine or already public, or if they do not 
contribute a unique interpretation or anal-
ysis to a news product. Thus, for example, 
newspaper reporters who merely rewrite 
press releases or who write standard re-
counts of public information by gathering 
facts on routine community events are not 
exempt 
creative 
professionals. 
Reporters 
also do not qualify as exempt creative pro-
fessionals if their work product is subject to 
substantial control by the employer. How-
ever, journalists may qualify as exempt cre-
ative professionals if their primary duty is 
performing on the air in radio, television or 
other electronic media; conducting inves-
tigative 
interviews; 
analyzing 
or 
inter-
preting public events; writing editorials, 
opinion columns or other commentary; or 
acting as a narrator or commentator. 
§ 541.303 Teachers. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act also means any employee 
with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, 
instructing or lecturing in the activity of 
imparting knowledge and who is employed 
and engaged in this activity as a teacher in 
an educational establishment by which the 
employee is employed. The term ‘‘edu-
cational 
establishment’’ 
is 
defined 
in 
§ 541.204(b). 
(b) Exempt teachers include, but are not 
limited 
to: 
Regular 
academic 
teachers; 
teachers of kindergarten or nursery school 
pupils; teachers of gifted or disabled chil-
dren; teachers of skilled and semi-skilled 
trades and occupations; teachers engaged in 
automobile 
driving 
instruction; 
aircraft 
flight instructors; home economics teachers; 
and vocal or instrumental music instructors. 
Those faculty members who are engaged as 
teachers but also spend a considerable 
amount of their time in extracurricular ac-
tivities such as coaching athletic teams or 
acting as moderators or advisors in such 
areas as drama, speech, debate or journalism 
are engaged in teaching. Such activities are 
a recognized part of the schools’ responsi-
bility in contributing to the educational de-
velopment of the student. 
(c) The possession of an elementary or sec-
ondary teacher’s certificate provides a clear 
means of identifying the individuals con-
templated as being within the scope of the 
exemption for teaching professionals. Teach-
ers who possess a teaching certificate qualify 
for the exemption regardless of the termi-
nology (e.g., permanent, conditional, stand-
ard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or 
unlimited) used by the State to refer to dif-
ferent kinds of certificates. However, private 
schools and public schools are not uniform in 
requiring a certificate for employment as an 
elementary or secondary school teacher, and 
a teacher’s certificate is not generally nec-
essary for employment in institutions of 
higher education or other educational estab-
lishments. Therefore, a teacher who is not 
certified may be considered for exemption, 
provided that such individual is employed as 
a teacher by the employing school or school 
system. 
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and Sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do 
not apply to the teaching professionals de-
scribed in this section. 
§ 541.304 Practice of law or medicine. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act also shall mean: 
(1) Any employee who is the holder of a 
valid license or certificate permitting the 
practice of law or medicine or any of their 
branches and is actually engaged in the prac-
tice thereof; and 
(2) Any employee who is the holder of the 
requisite academic degree for the general 
practice of medicine and is engaged in an in-
ternship or resident program pursuant to the 
practice of the profession. 
(b) In the case of medicine, the exemption 
applies to physicians and other practitioners 
licensed and practicing in the field of med-
ical science and healing or any of the med-
ical specialties practiced by physicians or 
practitioners. The term ‘‘physicians’’ in-
cludes medical doctors including general 
practitioners and specialists, osteopathic 
physicians (doctors of osteopathy), podia-
trists, dentists (doctors of dental medicine), 
and optometrists (doctors of optometry or 
bachelors of science in optometry). 
(c) Employees engaged in internship or 
resident programs, whether or not licensed 
to practice prior to commencement of the 
program, qualify as exempt professionals if 
they enter such internship or resident pro-
grams after the earning of the appropriate 
degree required for the general practice of 
their profession. 
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do 
not apply to the employees described in this 
section. 
SUBPART 
E—COMPUTER 
EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.400–541.402) 
§ 541.400 General rule for computer employ-
ees. 
(a) Computer systems analysts, computer 
programmers, software engineers or other 
similarly skilled workers in the computer 
field are eligible for exemption as profes-
sionals under section 13(a)(1) of the Act and 
under section 13(a)(17) of the Act. Because 
job titles vary widely and change quickly in 
the computer industry, job titles are not de-
terminative of the applicability of this ex-
emption. 
(b) The section 13(a)(1)exemption applies to 
any computer employee who is compensated 
on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less 
than $684 per week ø(or $455 per week if em-
ployed in the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or 
the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other 
than the Federal government, or $380 per 
week if employed in American Samoa by em-
ployers other than the Federal govern-
ment)¿, exclusive of board, lodging, or other 
facilities. 
The section 13(a)(17) exemption applies to 
any computer employee compensated on an 
hourly basis at a rate of not less than $27.63 
an hour. In addition, under either section 
13(a)(1) or section 13(a)(17) of the Act, the ex-
emptions apply only to computer employees 
whose primary duty consists of: 
(1) The application of systems analysis 
techniques and procedures, including con-
sulting with users, to determine hardware, 
software or system functional specifications; 
(2) The design, development, documenta-
tion, analysis, creation, testing or modifica-
tion of computer systems or programs, in-
cluding prototypes, based on and related to 
user or system design specifications; 
(3) The design, documentation, testing, 
creation or modification of computer pro-
grams related to machine operating systems; 
or 
(4) A combination of the aforementioned 
duties, the performance of which requires 
the same level of skills. 
(c) The term ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘fee basis’’ is defined at § 541.605; 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.401 Computer manufacture and repair. 
The exemption for employees in computer 
occupations does not include employees en-
gaged in the manufacture or repair of com-
puter hardware and related equipment. Em-
ployees whose work is highly dependent 
upon, or facilitated by, the use of computers 
and computer software programs (e.g., engi-
neers, drafters and others skilled in com-
puter-aided design software), but who are not 
primarily engaged in computer systems

analysis and programming or other similarly 
skilled computer-related occupations identi-
fied in § 541.400(b), are also not exempt com-
puter professionals. 
§ 541.402 Executive and administrative com-
puter employees. 
Computer employees within the scope of 
this exemption, as well as those employees 
not within its scope, may also have execu-
tive and administrative duties which qualify 
the employees for exemption under subpart 
B or subpart C of this part. For example, sys-
tems analysts and computer programmers 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption if their pri-
mary duty includes work such as planning, 
scheduling, and coordinating activities re-
quired to develop systems to solve complex 
business, scientific or engineering problems 
of the employer or the employer’s customers. 
Similarly, a senior or lead computer pro-
grammer who manages the work of two or 
more other programmers in a customarily 
recognized department or subdivision of the 
employer, and whose recommendations as to 
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion 
or other change of status of the other pro-
grammers are given particular weight, gen-
erally meets the duties requirements for the 
executive exemption. 
øSUBPART F—OUTSIDE SALES EMPLOY-
EES (§§ 541.500–541.504) 
§ 541.500 General rule for outside sales em-
ployees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in the 
capacity of outside salesman’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Whose primary duty is: 
(i) making sales within the meaning of sec-
tion 3(k) of the Act, or 
(ii) obtaining orders or contracts for serv-
ices or for the use of facilities for which a 
consideration will be paid by the client or 
customer; and 
(2) Who is customarily and regularly en-
gaged away from the employer’s place or 
places of business in performing such pri-
mary duty. 
(b) The term ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. In determining the primary duty of 
an outside sales employee, work performed 
incidental to and in conjunction with the 
employee’s own outside sales or solicita-
tions, including incidental deliveries and col-
lections, shall be regarded as exempt outside 
sales work. Other work that furthers the em-
ployee’s sales efforts also shall be regarded 
as exempt work including, for example, writ-
ing sales reports, updating or revising the 
employee’s sales or display catalogue, plan-
ning itineraries and attending sales con-
ferences. 
(c) The requirements of subpart G (salary 
requirements) of this part do not apply to 
the outside sales employees described in this 
section. 
§ 541.501 Making sales or obtaining orders. 
(a) Section 541.500 requires that the em-
ployee be engaged in: 
(1) Making sales within the meaning of sec-
tion 3(k) of the Act, or 
(2) Obtaining orders or contracts for serv-
ices or for the use of facilities. 
(b) Sales within the meaning of section 
3(k) of the Act include the transfer of title to 
tangible property, and in certain cases, of 
tangible and valuable evidences of intangible 
property. Section 3(k) of the Act states that 
‘‘sale’’ or ‘‘sell’’ includes any sale, exchange, 
contract to sell, consignment for sale, ship-
ment for sale, or other disposition. 
(c) Exempt outside sales work includes not 
only the sales of commodities, but also ‘‘ob-
taining orders or contracts for services or for 
the use of facilities for which a consideration 
will be paid by the client or customer.’’ Ob-
taining orders for ‘‘the use of facilities’’ in-
cludes the selling of time on radio or tele-
vision, the solicitation of advertising for 
newspapers and other periodicals, and the so-
licitation of freight for railroads and other 
transportation agencies. 
(d) The word ‘‘services’’ extends the out-
side sales exemption to employees who sell 
or take orders for a service, which may be 
performed for the customer by someone 
other than the person taking the order. 
§ 541.502 Away from employer’s place of busi-
ness. 
An outside sales employee must be custom-
arily and regularly engaged ‘‘away from the 
employer’s place or places of business.’’ The 
outside sales employee is an employee who 
makes sales at the customer’s place of busi-
ness or, if selling door-to-door, at the cus-
tomer’s home. Outside sales does not include 
sales made by mail, telephone or the Inter-
net unless such contact is used merely as an 
adjunct to personal calls. Thus, any fixed 
site, whether home or office, used by a sales-
person as a headquarters or for telephonic 
solicitation of sales is considered one of the 
employer’s places of business, even though 
the employer is not in any formal sense the 
owner or tenant of the property. However, an 
outside sales employee does not lose the ex-
emption by displaying samples in hotel sam-
ple rooms during trips from city to city; 
these sample rooms should not be considered 
as the employer’s places of business. Simi-
larly, an outside sales employee does not 
lose the exemption by displaying the em-
ployer’s products at a trade show. If selling 
actually occurs, rather than just sales pro-
motion, trade shows of short duration (i.e., 
one or two weeks) should not be considered 
as the employer’s place of business. 
§ 541.503 Promotion work. 
(a) Promotion work is one type of activity 
often performed by persons who make sales, 
which may or may not be exempt outside 
sales 
work, 
depending 
upon 
the 
cir-
cumstances under which it is performed. 
Promotional work that is actually performed 
incidental to and in conjunction with an em-
ployee’s own outside sales or solicitations is 
exempt work. On the other hand, pro-
motional work that is incidental to sales 
made, or to be made, by someone else is not 
exempt outside sales work. An employee who 
does not satisfy the requirements of this sub-
part may still qualify as an exempt em-
ployee under other subparts of this rule. 
(b) A manufacturer’s representative, for 
example, may perform various types of pro-
motional activities such as putting up dis-
plays and posters, removing damaged or 
spoiled stock from the merchant’s shelves or 
rearranging the merchandise. Such an em-
ployee can be considered an exempt outside 
sales employee if the employee’s primary 
duty is making sales or contracts. Pro-
motion 
activities 
directed 
toward 
con-
summation of the employee’s own sales are 
exempt. Promotional activities designed to 
stimulate sales that will be made by some-
one else are not exempt outside sales work. 
(c) Another example is a company rep-
resentative who visits chain stores, arranges 
the merchandise on shelves, replenishes 
stock by replacing old with new merchan-
dise, sets up displays and consults with the 
store manager when inventory runs low, but 
does not obtain a commitment for additional 
purchases. The arrangement of merchandise 
on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is 
not exempt work unless it is incidental to 
and in conjunction with the employee’s own 
outside sales. Because the employee in this 
instance does not consummate the sale nor 
direct efforts toward the consummation of a 
sale, the work is not exempt outside sales 
work. 
§ 541.504 Drivers who sell. 
(a) Drivers who deliver products and also 
sell such products may qualify as exempt 
outside sales employees only if the employee 
has a primary duty of making sales. In deter-
mining the primary duty of drivers who sell, 
work performed incidental to and in conjunc-
tion with the employee’s own outside sales 
or solicitations, including loading, driving or 
delivering products, shall be regarded as ex-
empt outside sales work. 
(b) Several factors should be considered in 
determining if a driver has a primary duty of 
making sales, including, but not limited to: 
a comparison of the driver’s duties with 
those of other employees engaged as truck 
drivers and as salespersons; possession of a 
selling or solicitor’s license when such li-
cense is required by law or ordinances; pres-
ence or absence of customary or contractual 
arrangements concerning amounts of prod-
ucts to be delivered; description of the em-
ployee’s occupation in collective bargaining 
agreements; the employer’s specifications as 
to qualifications for hiring; sales training; 
attendance at sales conferences; method of 
payment; and proportion of earnings directly 
attributable to sales. 
(c) Drivers who may qualify as exempt out-
side sales employees include: 
(1) A driver who provides the only sales 
contact between the employer and the cus-
tomers visited, who calls on customers and 
takes orders for products, who delivers prod-
ucts from stock in the employee’s vehicle or 
procures and delivers the product to the cus-
tomer on a later trip, and who receives com-
pensation commensurate with the volume of 
products sold. 
(2) A driver who obtains or solicits orders 
for the employer’s products from persons 
who have authority to commit the customer 
for purchases. 
(3) A driver who calls on new prospects for 
customers along the employee’s route and 
attempts to convince them of the desir-
ability of accepting regular delivery of 
goods. 
(4) A driver who calls on established cus-
tomers along the route and persuades reg-
ular customers to accept delivery of in-
creased amounts of goods or of new products, 
even though the initial sale or agreement for 
delivery was made by someone else. 
(d) Drivers who generally would not qual-
ify as exempt outside sales employees in-
clude: 
(1) A route driver whose primary duty is to 
transport products sold by the employer 
through vending machines and to keep such 
machines stocked, in good operating condi-
tion, and in good locations. 
(2) A driver who often calls on established 
customers day after day or week after week, 
delivering a quantity of the employer’s prod-
ucts at each call when the sale was not sig-
nificantly affected by solicitations of the 
customer by the delivering driver or the 
amount of the sale is determined by the vol-
ume of the customer’s sales since the pre-
vious delivery. 
(3) A driver primarily engaged in making 
deliveries to customers and performing ac-
tivities intended to promote sales by cus-
tomers (including placing point-of-sale and 
other advertising materials, price stamping 
commodities, 
arranging 
merchandise 
on 
shelves, in coolers or in cabinets, rotating 
stock according to date, and cleaning and 
otherwise servicing display cases), unless 
such work is in furtherance of the driver’s 
own sales efforts.¿

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4505 
April 26, 2022 
section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must 
be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of 
not less than $684 per week ø(or $455 per week 
if employed in the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto 
Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers 
other than the Federal Government, or $380 
per week if employed in American Samoa by 
employers other than the Federal Govern-
ment)¿, exclusive of board, lodging or other 
facilities. Administrative and professional 
employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as 
defined in § 541.605. 
(b) The required amount of compensation 
per week may be translated into equivalent 
amounts for periods longer than one week. 
For example, the $684-per-week requirement 
will be met if the employee is compensated 
biweekly on a salary basis of not less than 
$1,368, semimonthly on a salary basis of not 
less than $1,482, or monthly on a salary basis 
of not less than $2,964. However, the shortest 
period of payment that will meet this com-
pensation requirement is one week. 
(c) In the case of academic administrative 
employees, the compensation requirement 
also may be met by compensation on a sal-
ary basis at a rate at least equal to the en-
trance salary for teachers in the educational 
establishment by which the employee is em-
ployed, as provided in § 541.204(a)(1). 
(d) In the case of computer employees, the 
compensation requirement also may be met 
by compensation on an hourly basis at a rate 
not less than $27.63 an hour, as provided in 
§ 541.400(b). 
(e) In the case of professional employees, 
the compensation requirements in this sec-
tion shall not apply to employees engaged as 
teachers (see § 541.303); employees who hold a 
valid license or certificate permitting the 
practice of law or medicine or any of their 
branches and are actually engaged in the 
practice thereof (see § 541.304); or to employ-
ees who hold the requisite academic degree 
for the general practice of medicine and are 
engaged in an internship or resident program 
pursuant to the practice of the profession 
(see § 541.304). In the case of medical occupa-
tions, the exception from the salary or fee 
requirement does not apply to pharmacists, 
nurses, 
therapists, 
technologists, 
sanitarians, dietitians, social workers, psy-
chologists, psychometrists, or other profes-
sions which service the medical profession. 
SUBPART 
H—DEFINITIONS 
AND 
MIS-
CELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (§§ 541.700– 
541.710) 
§ 541.601 Highly compensated employees. 
(a)(1) Beginning on January 1, 2020, an em-
ployee with total annual compensation of at 
least $107,432 is deemed exempt under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act if the employee custom-
arily and regularly performs any one or more 
of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an 
executive, administrative or professional 
employee as identified in subparts B, C or D 
of this part. 
(2) Where the annual period covers periods 
both prior to and after January 1, 2020, the 
amount of total annual compensation due 
will be determined on a proportional basis. 
(b)(1) ‘‘Total annual compensation’’ must 
include at least $684 per week paid on a sal-
ary or fee basis as set forth in §§ 541.602 and 
541.605, except that § 541.602(a)(3) shall not 
apply to highly compensated employees. 
Total annual compensation may also include 
commissions, nondiscretionary bonuses and 
other nondiscretionary compensation earned 
during a 52-week period. Total annual com-
pensation does not include board, lodging 
and other facilities as defined in § 541.606, and 
does not include payments for medical insur-
ance, payments for life insurance, contribu-
tions to retirement plans and the cost of 
other fringe benefits. 
(2) If an employee’s total annual com-
pensation does not total at least the amount 
specified in the applicable subsection of 
paragraph (a) by the last pay period of the 
52-week period, the employer may, during 
the last pay period or within one month 
after the end of the 52-week period, make one 
final payment sufficient to achieve the re-
quired level. For example, for a 52-week pe-
riod beginning January 1, 2020, an employee 
may earn $90,000 in base salary, and the em-
ployer may anticipate based upon past sales 
that the employee also will earn $17,432 in 
commissions. However, due to poor sales in 
the final quarter of the year, the employee 
actually only earns $12,000 in commissions. 
In this situation, the employer may within 
one month after the end of the year make a 
payment of at least $5,432 to the employee. 
Any such final payment made after the end 
of the 52-week period may count only toward 
the prior year’s total annual compensation 
and not toward the total annual compensa-
tion in the year it was paid. If the employer 
fails to make such a payment, the employee 
does not qualify as a highly compensated 
employee, but may still qualify as exempt 
under subparts B, C, or D of this part. 
(3) An employee who does not work a full 
year for the employer, either because the 
employee is newly hired after the beginning 
of the year or ends the employment before 
the end of the year, may qualify for exemp-
tion under this section if the employee re-
ceives a pro rata portion of the minimum 
amount established in paragraph (a) of this 
section, based upon the number of weeks 
that the employee will be or has been em-
ployed. An employer may make one final 
payment as under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section within one month after the end of 
employment. 
(4) The employer may utilize any 52-week 
period as the year, such as a calendar year, 
a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. 
If the employer does not identify some other 
year period in advance, the calendar year 
will apply. 
(c) A high level of compensation is a strong 
indicator of an employee’s exempt status, 
thus eliminating the need for a detailed 
analysis of the employee’s job duties. Thus, 
a highly compensated employee will qualify 
for exemption if the employee customarily 
and regularly performs any one or more of 
the exempt duties or responsibilities of an 
executive, administrative or professional 
employee identified in subparts B, C or D of 
this part. An employee may qualify as a 
highly compensated executive employee, for 
example, if the employee customarily and 
regularly directs the work of two or more 
other employees, even though the employee 
does not meet all of the other requirements 
for the executive exemption under § 541.100. 
(d) This section applies only to employees 
whose primary duty includes performing of-
fice or non-manual work. Thus, for example, 
non-management 
production-line 
workers 
and non-management employees in mainte-
nance, construction and similar occupations 
such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, 
plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating 
engineers, longshoremen, construction work-
ers, laborers and other employees who per-
form work involving repetitive operations 
with their hands, physical skill and energy 
are not exempt under this section no matter 
how highly paid they might be. 
§ 541.602 Salary basis. 
(a) General rule. An employee will be con-
sidered to be paid on a ‘‘salary basis’’ within 
the meaning of this part if the employee reg-
ularly receives each pay period on a weekly, 
or less frequent basis, a predetermined 
amount constituting all or part of the em-
ployee’s compensation, which amount is not 
subject to reduction because of variations in 
the quality or quantity of the work per-
formed. 
(1) Subject to the exceptions provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, an exempt em-
ployee must receive the full salary for any 
week in which the employee performs any 
work without regard to the number of days 
or hours worked. Exempt employees need not 
be paid for any workweek in which they per-
form no work. 
(2) An employee is not paid on a salary 
basis if deductions from the employee’s pre-
determined compensation are made for ab-
sences occasioned by the employer or by the 
operating requirements of the business. If 
the employee is ready, willing and able to 
work, deductions may not be made for time 
when work is not available. 
(3) Up to ten percent of the salary amount 
required by § 541.600(a) may be satisfied by 
the payment of nondiscretionary bonuses, in-
centives and commissions, that are paid an-
nually or more frequently. The employer 
may utilize any 52-week period as the year, 
such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an 
anniversary of hire year. If the employer 
does not identify some other year period in 
advance, the calendar year will apply. This 
provision does not apply to highly com-
pensated employees under § 541.601. 
(i) If by the last pay period of the 52-week 
period the sum of the employee’s weekly sal-
ary plus nondiscretionary bonus, incentive, 
and commission payments received is less 
than 52 times the weekly salary amount re-
quired by § 541.600(a), the employer may 
make one final payment sufficient to achieve 
the required level no later than the next pay 
period after the end of the year. Any such 
final payment made after the end of the 52– 
week period may count only toward the prior 
year’s salary amount and not toward the sal-
ary amount in the year it was paid. 
(ii) An employee who does not work a full 
52-week period for the employer, either be-
cause the employee is newly hired after the 
beginning of this period or ends the employ-
ment before the end of this period, may qual-
ify for exemption if the employee receives a 
pro rata portion of the minimum amount es-
tablished in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
based upon the number of weeks that the 
employee will be or has been employed. An 
employer may make one final payment as 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section with-
in one pay period after the end of employ-
ment. 
(b) Exceptions. The prohibition against de-
ductions from pay in the salary basis re-
quirement is subject to the following excep-
tions: 
(1) Deductions from pay may be made when 
an exempt employee is absent from work for 
one or more full days for personal reasons, 
other than sickness or disability. Thus, if an 
employee is absent for two full days to han-
dle personal affairs, the employee’s salaried 
status will not be affected if deductions are 
made from the salary for two full-day ab-
sences. However, if an exempt employee is 
absent for one and a half days for personal 
reasons, the employer can deduct only for 
the one full-day absence. 
(2) Deductions from pay may be made for 
absences of one or more full days occasioned 
by sickness or disability (including work-re-
lated accidents) if the deduction is made in 
accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or 
practice of providing compensation for loss 
of salary occasioned by such sickness or dis-
ability. The employer is not required to pay 
any portion of the employee’s salary for full- 
day absences for which the employee re-
ceives compensation under the plan, policy 
or practice. Deductions for such full-day ab-
sences also may be made before the em-
ployee has qualified under the plan, policy or

practice, and after the employee has ex-
hausted the leave allowance thereunder. 
Thus, for example, if an employer maintains 
a short-term disability insurance plan pro-
viding salary replacement for 12 weeks start-
ing on the fourth day of absence, the em-
ployer may make deductions from pay for 
the three days of absence before the em-
ployee qualifies for benefits under the plan; 
for the twelve weeks in which the employee 
receives salary replacement benefits under 
the plan; and for absences after the employee 
has exhausted the 12 weeks of salary replace-
ment benefits. Similarly, an employer may 
make deductions from pay for absences of 
one or more full days if salary replacement 
benefits are provided under a State dis-
ability insurance law or under a State work-
ers’ compensation law. 
(3) While an employer cannot make deduc-
tions from pay for absences of an exempt em-
ployee occasioned by jury duty, attendance 
as a witness or temporary military leave, the 
employer can offset any amounts received by 
an employee as jury fees, witness fees or 
military pay for a particular week against 
the salary due for that particular week with-
out loss of the exemption. 
(4) Deductions from pay of exempt employ-
ees may be made for penalties imposed in 
good faith for infractions of safety rules of 
major significance. Safety rules of major sig-
nificance include those relating to the pre-
vention of serious danger in the workplace or 
to other employees, such as rules prohibiting 
smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries 
and coal mines. 
(5) Deductions from pay of exempt employ-
ees may be made for unpaid disciplinary sus-
pensions of one or more full days imposed in 
good faith for infractions of workplace con-
duct rules. Such suspensions must be im-
posed pursuant to a written policy applicable 
to all employees. Thus, for example, an em-
ployer may suspend an exempt employee 
without pay for three days for violating a 
generally applicable written policy prohib-
iting sexual harassment. Similarly, an em-
ployer may suspend an exempt employee 
without pay for twelve days for violating a 
generally applicable written policy prohib-
iting workplace violence. 
(6) An employer is not required to pay the 
full salary in the initial or terminal week of 
employment. Rather, an employer may pay a 
proportionate part of an employee’s full sal-
ary for the time actually worked in the first 
and last week of employment. In such weeks, 
the payment of an hourly or daily equivalent 
of the employee’s full salary for the time ac-
tually worked will meet the requirement. 
However, employees are not paid on a salary 
basis within the meaning of these regula-
tions if they are employed occasionally for a 
few days, and the employer pays them a pro-
portionate part of the weekly salary when so 
employed. 
(7) An employer is not required to pay the 
full salary for weeks in which an exempt em-
ployee takes unpaid leave under the Family 
and Medical Leave Act. Rather, when an ex-
empt employee takes unpaid leave under the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer 
may pay a proportionate part of the full sal-
ary for time actually worked. For example, 
if an employee who normally works 40 hours 
per week uses four hours of unpaid leave 
under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
the employer could deduct 10 percent of the 
employee’s normal salary that week. 
(c) When calculating the amount of a de-
duction from pay allowed under paragraph 
(b) of this section, the employer may use the 
hourly or daily equivalent of the employee’s 
full weekly salary or any other amount pro-
portional to the time actually missed by the 
employee. A deduction from pay as a penalty 
for violations of major safety rules under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be made 
in any amount. 
§ 541.603 Effect of improper deductions from 
salary. 
(a) An employer who makes improper de-
ductions from salary shall lose the exemp-
tion if the facts demonstrate that the em-
ployer did not intend to pay employees on a 
salary basis. An actual practice of making 
improper deductions demonstrates that the 
employer did not intend to pay employees on 
a salary basis. The factors to consider when 
determining whether an employer has an ac-
tual practice of making improper deductions 
include, but are not limited to: the number 
of improper deductions, particularly as com-
pared to the number of employee infractions 
warranting discipline; the time period during 
which the employer made improper deduc-
tions; the number and geographic location of 
employees whose salary was improperly re-
duced; the number and geographic location 
of managers responsible for taking the im-
proper deductions; and whether the employer 
has a clearly communicated policy permit-
ting or prohibiting improper deductions. 
(b) If the facts demonstrate that the em-
ployer has an actual practice of making im-
proper deductions, the exemption is lost dur-
ing the time period in which the improper 
deductions were made for employees in the 
same job classification working for the same 
managers responsible for the actual im-
proper deductions. Employees in different 
job classifications or who work for different 
managers do not lose their status as exempt 
employees. Thus, for example, if a manager 
at a company facility routinely docks the 
pay of engineers at that facility for partial- 
day personal absences, then all engineers at 
that facility whose pay could have been im-
properly docked by the manager would lose 
the exemption; engineers at other facilities 
or working for other managers, however, 
would remain exempt. 
(c) Improper deductions that are either iso-
lated or inadvertent will not result in loss of 
the exemption for any employees subject to 
such improper deductions, if the employer 
reimburses the employees for such improper 
deductions. 
(d) If an employer has a clearly commu-
nicated policy that prohibits the improper 
pay deductions specified in § 541.602(a) and in-
cludes a complaint mechanism, reimburses 
employees for any improper deductions and 
makes a good faith commitment to comply 
in the future, such employer will not lose the 
exemption for any employees unless the em-
ployer willfully violates the policy by con-
tinuing to make improper deductions after 
receiving employee complaints. If an em-
ployer fails to reimburse employees for any 
improper deductions or continues to make 
improper deductions after receiving em-
ployee complaints, the exemption is lost dur-
ing the time period in which the improper 
deductions were made for employees in the 
same job classification working for the same 
managers responsible for the actual im-
proper deductions. The best evidence of a 
clearly communicated policy is a written 
policy that was distributed to employees 
prior to the improper pay deductions by, for 
example, providing a copy of the policy to 
employees at the time of hire, publishing the 
policy in an employee handbook or pub-
lishing 
the 
policy 
on 
the 
employer’s 
Intranet. 
(e) This section shall not be construed in 
an unduly technical manner so as to defeat 
the exemption. 
§ 541.604 Minimum guarantee plus extras. 
(a) An employer may provide an exempt 
employee 
with 
additional 
compensation 
without losing the exemption or violating 
the salary basis requirement, if the employ-
ment arrangement also includes a guarantee 
of at least the minimum weekly-required 
amount paid on a salary basis. Thus, for ex-
ample, an exempt employee guaranteed at 
least $684 each week paid on a salary basis 
may also receive additional compensation of 
a one percent commission on sales. An ex-
empt employee also may receive a percent-
age of the sales or profits of the employer if 
the employment arrangement also includes a 
guarantee of at least $684 each week paid on 
a salary basis. Similarly, the exemption is 
not lost if an exempt employee who is guar-
anteed at least $684 each week paid on a sal-
ary basis also receives additional compensa-
tion based on hours worked for work beyond 
the normal workweek. Such additional com-
pensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., flat 
sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly 
amount, time and one-half or any other 
basis), and may include paid time off. 
(b) An exempt employee’s earnings may be 
computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift 
basis, without losing the exemption or vio-
lating the salary basis requirement, if the 
employment arrangement also includes a 
guarantee of at least the minimum weekly 
required amount paid on a salary basis re-
gardless of the number of hours, days or 
shifts worked, and a reasonable relationship 
exists between the guaranteed amount and 
the amount actually earned. The reasonable 
relationship test will be met if the weekly 
guarantee is roughly equivalent to the em-
ployee’s usual earnings at the assigned hour-
ly, daily or shift rate for the employee’s nor-
mal scheduled workweek. Thus, for example, 
an exempt employee guaranteed compensa-
tion of at least $725 for any week in which 
the employee performs any work, and who 
normally works four or five shifts each week, 
may be paid $210 per shift without violating 
the $684-per-week salary basis requirement. 
The reasonable relationship requirement ap-
plies only if the employee’s pay is computed 
on an hourly, daily or shift basis. It does not 
apply, for example, to an exempt store man-
ager paid a guaranteed salary per week that 
exceeds the current salary level who also re-
ceives a commission of one-half percent of 
all sales in the store or five percent of the 
store’s profits, which in some weeks may 
total as much as, or even more than, the 
guaranteed salary. 
§ 541.605 Fee basis. 
(a) Administrative and professional em-
ployees may be paid on a fee basis, rather 
than on a salary basis. An employee will be 
considered to be paid on a ‘‘fee basis’’ within 
the meaning of these regulations if the em-
ployee is paid an agreed sum for a single job 
regardless of the time required for its com-
pletion. These payments resemble piecework 
payments with the important distinction 
that generally a ‘‘fee’’ is paid for the kind of 
job that is unique rather than for a series of 
jobs repeated an indefinite number of times 
and for which payment on an identical basis 
is made over and over again. Payments based 
on the number of hours or days worked and 
not on the accomplishment of a given single 
task are not considered payments on a fee 
basis. 
(b) To determine whether the fee payment 
meets the minimum amount of salary re-
quired for exemption under these regula-
tions, the amount paid to the employee will 
be tested by determining the time worked on 
the job and whether the fee payment is at a 
rate that would amount to at least the min-
imum salary per week, as required by 
§§ 541.600(a) and 541.602(a), if the employee 
worked 40 hours. Thus, an artist paid $350 for 
a picture that took 20 hours to complete 
meets the $684 minimum salary requirement 
for exemption since earnings at this rate 
would yield the artist $700 if 40 hours were 
worked.

§ 541.606 Board, lodging or other facilities. 
(a) To qualify for exemption under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must earn 
the minimum salary amount set forth in 
§ 541.600, ‘‘exclusive of board, lodging or other 
facilities.’’ The phrase ‘‘exclusive of board, 
lodging or other facilities’’ means ‘‘free and 
clear’’ or independent of any claimed credit 
for non-cash items of value that an employer 
may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs 
incurred by an employer to provide an em-
ployee with board, lodging or other facilities 
may not count towards the minimum salary 
amount required for exemption under this 
part 541. Such separate transactions are not 
prohibited between employers and their ex-
empt employees, but the costs to employers 
associated with such transactions may not 
be considered when determining if an em-
ployee has received the full required min-
imum salary payment. 
(b) Regulations defining what constitutes 
‘‘board, lodging, or other facilities’’ are con-
tained in 29 CFR part 531 <<which are incor-
porated herein>>. øAs described in 29 CFR 
531.32, the term ‘‘other facilities’’ refers to 
items similar to board and lodging, such as 
meals furnished at company restaurants or 
cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or res-
taurants to their employees; meals, dor-
mitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a 
college to its student employees; merchan-
dise furnished at company stores or com-
missaries, including articles of food, cloth-
ing, and household effects; housing furnished 
for dwelling purposes; and transportation 
furnished to employees for ordinary com-
muting between their homes and work.¿ 
ø§ 541.607¿ øReserved by 85 FR 34970 Effec-
tive: June 8, 2020¿ 
§ 541.700 Primary duty. 
(a) To qualify for exemption under this 
part, an employee’s ‘‘primary duty’’ must be 
the performance of exempt work. The term 
‘‘primary duty’’ means the principal, main, 
major or most important duty that the em-
ployee performs. Determination of an em-
ployee’s primary duty must be based on all 
the facts in a particular case, with the major 
emphasis on the character of the employee’s 
job as a whole. Factors to consider when de-
termining the primary duty of an employee 
include, but are not limited to, the relative 
importance of the exempt duties as com-
pared with other types of duties; the amount 
of time spent performing exempt work; the 
employee’s relative freedom from direct su-
pervision; and the relationship between the 
employee’s salary and the wages paid to 
other employees for the kind of nonexempt 
work performed by the employee. 
(b) The amount of time spent performing 
exempt work can be a useful guide in deter-
mining whether exempt work is the primary 
duty of an employee. Thus, employees who 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt work will generally satisfy 
the primary duty requirement. Time alone, 
however, is not the sole test, and nothing in 
this section requires that exempt employees 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt work. Employees who do not 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt duties may nonetheless 
meet the primary duty requirement if the 
other factors support such a conclusion. 
(c) Thus, for example, assistant managers 
in a retail establishment who perform ex-
empt executive work such as supervising and 
directing the work of other employees, or-
dering merchandise, managing the budget 
and authorizing payment of bills may have 
management as their primary duty even if 
the assistant managers spend more than 50 
percent of the time performing nonexempt 
work such as running the cash register. How-
ever, if such assistant managers are closely 
supervised and earn little more than the 
nonexempt employees, the assistant man-
agers generally would not satisfy the pri-
mary duty requirement. 
§ 541.701 Customarily and regularly. 
The phrase ‘‘customarily and regularly’’ 
means a frequency that must be greater than 
occasional but which, of course, may be less 
than constant. Tasks or work performed 
‘‘customarily and regularly’’ includes work 
normally and recurrently performed every 
workweek; it does not include isolated or 
one-time tasks. 
§ 541.702 Exempt and nonexempt work. 
The term ‘‘exempt work’’ means all work 
described in §§ 541.100, 541.101, 541.200, 541.300, 
541.301, 
541.302, 
541.303, 
541.304, 
<<and>> 
541.400 øand 541.500¿, and the activities di-
rectly and closely related to such work. All 
other work is considered ‘‘nonexempt.’’ 
§ 541.703 Directly and closely related. 
(a) Work that is ‘‘directly and closely re-
lated’’ to the performance of exempt work is 
also considered exempt work. The phrase 
‘‘directly and closely related’’ means tasks 
that are related to exempt duties and that 
contribute to or facilitate performance of ex-
empt work. Thus, ‘‘directly and closely re-
lated’’ work may include physical tasks and 
menial tasks that arise out of exempt duties, 
and the routine work without which the ex-
empt employee’s exempt work cannot be per-
formed properly. Work ‘‘directly and closely 
related’’ to the performance of exempt duties 
may also include recordkeeping; monitoring 
and adjusting machinery; taking notes; 
using the computer to create documents or 
presentations; opening the mail for the pur-
pose of reading it and making decisions; and 
using a photocopier or fax machine. Work is 
not ‘‘directly and closely related’’ if the 
work is remotely related or completely unre-
lated to exempt duties. 
(b) The following examples further illus-
trate the type of work that is and is not nor-
mally considered as directly and closely re-
lated to exempt work: 
(1) Keeping time, production or sales 
records for subordinates is work directly and 
closely related to an exempt executive’s 
function of managing a department and su-
pervising employees. 
(2) The distribution of materials, merchan-
dise or supplies to maintain control of the 
flow of and expenditures for such items is di-
rectly and closely related to the performance 
of exempt duties. 
(3) A supervisor who spot checks and exam-
ines the work of subordinates to determine 
whether they are performing their duties 
properly, and whether the product is satis-
factory, is performing work which is directly 
and closely related to managerial and super-
visory functions, so long as the checking is 
distinguishable from the work ordinarily 
performed by a nonexempt inspector. 
(4) A supervisor who sets up a machine 
may be engaged in exempt work, depending 
upon the nature of the industry and the oper-
ation. In some cases the setup work, or ad-
justment of the machine for a particular job, 
is typically performed by the same employ-
ees who operate the machine. Such setup 
work is part of the production operation and 
is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up 
of the work is a highly skilled operation 
which the ordinary production worker or 
machine tender typically does not perform. 
In large plants, non-supervisors may perform 
such work. However, particularly in small 
plants, such work may be a regular duty of 
the executive and is directly and closely re-
lated to the executive’s responsibility for the 
work performance of subordinates and for 
the adequacy of the final product. Under 
such circumstances, it is exempt work. 
(5) A department manager in a retail or 
service establishment who walks about the 
sales floor observing the work of sales per-
sonnel under the employee’s supervision to 
determine the effectiveness of their sales 
techniques, checks on the quality of cus-
tomer service being given, or observes cus-
tomer preferences is performing work which 
is directly and closely related to managerial 
and supervisory functions. 
(6) A business consultant may take exten-
sive notes recording the flow of work and 
materials through the office or plant of the 
client; after returning to the office of the 
employer, the consultant may personally use 
the computer to type a report and create a 
proposed table of organization. Standing 
alone, or separated from the primary duty, 
such note-taking and typing would be rou-
tine in nature. However, because this work is 
necessary for analyzing the data and making 
recommendations, the work is directly and 
closely related to exempt work. While it is 
possible to assign note-taking and typing to 
nonexempt employees, and in fact it is fre-
quently the practice to do so, delegating 
such routine tasks is not required as a condi-
tion of exemption. 
(7) A credit manager who makes and ad-
ministers the credit policy of the employer, 
establishes credit limits for customers, au-
thorizes the shipment of orders on credit, 
and makes decisions on whether to exceed 
credit limits would be performing work ex-
empt under § 541.200. Work that is directly 
and closely related to these exempt duties 
may include checking the status of accounts 
to determine whether the credit limit would 
be exceeded by the shipment of a new order, 
removing credit reports from the files for 
analysis, and writing letters giving credit 
data and experience to other employers or 
credit agencies. 
(8) A traffic manager in charge of planning 
a company’s transportation, including the 
most economical and quickest routes for 
shipping merchandise to and from the plant, 
contracting for common-carrier and other 
transportation facilities, negotiating with 
carriers for adjustments for damages to mer-
chandise, and making the necessary re-
arrangements resulting from delays, dam-
ages or irregularities in transit, is per-
forming exempt work. If the employee also 
spends part of the day taking telephone or-
ders for local deliveries, such order-taking is 
a routine function and is not directly and 
closely related to the exempt work. 
(9) An example of work directly and closely 
related to exempt professional duties is a 
chemist performing menial tasks such as 
cleaning a test tube in the middle of an 
original experiment, even though such me-
nial tasks can be assigned to laboratory as-
sistants. 
(10) A teacher performs work directly and 
closely related to exempt duties when, while 
taking students on a field trip, the teacher 
drives a school van or monitors the students’ 
behavior in a restaurant. 
§ 541.704 Use of manuals. 
The use of manuals, guidelines or other es-
tablished procedures containing or relating 
to highly technical, scientific, legal, finan-
cial or other similarly complex matters that 
can be understood or interpreted only by 
those with advanced or specialized knowl-
edge or skills does not preclude exemption 
under section 13(a)(1) of the Act or the regu-
lations in this part. Such manuals and proce-
dures provide guidance in addressing dif-
ficult or novel circumstances and thus use of 
such reference material would not affect an 
employee’s 
exempt 
status. 
The 
section 
13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, how-
ever, for employees who simply apply well- 
established techniques or procedures de-
scribed in manuals or other sources within

closely prescribed limits to determine the 
correct response to an inquiry or set of cir-
cumstances. 
§ 541.705 Trainees. 
The 
executive, 
administrative, 
profes-
sional, øoutside sales¿ and computer em-
ployee exemptions do not apply to employees 
training for employment in an executive, ad-
ministrative, professional, øoutside sales¿ or 
computer employee capacity who are not ac-
tually performing the duties of an executive, 
administrative, professional, øoutside sales¿ 
or computer employee. 
§ 541.706 Emergencies. 
(a) An exempt employee will not lose the 
exemption by performing work of a normally 
nonexempt nature because of the existence 
of an emergency. Thus, when emergencies 
arise that threaten the safety of employees, 
a cessation of operations or serious damage 
to the employer’s property, any work per-
formed in an effort to prevent such results is 
considered exempt work. 
(b) An ‘‘emergency’’ does not include oc-
currences that are not beyond control or for 
which the employer can reasonably provide 
in the normal course of business. Emer-
gencies generally occur only rarely, and are 
events that the employer cannot reasonably 
anticipate. 
(c) The following examples illustrate the 
distinction between emergency work consid-
ered exempt work and routine work that is 
not exempt work: 
(1) A mine superintendent who pitches in 
after an explosion and digs out workers who 
are trapped in the mine is still a bona fide 
executive. 
(2) Assisting nonexempt employees with 
their work during periods of heavy workload 
or to handle rush orders is not exempt work. 
(3) Replacing a nonexempt employee dur-
ing the first day or partial day of an illness 
may be considered exempt emergency work 
depending on factors such as the size of the 
establishment and of the executive’s depart-
ment, the nature of the industry, the con-
sequences that would flow from the failure 
to replace the ailing employee immediately, 
and the feasibility of filling the employee’s 
place promptly. 
(4) Regular repair and cleaning of equip-
ment is not emergency work, even when nec-
essary to prevent fire or explosion; however, 
repairing equipment may be emergency work 
if the breakdown of or damage to the equip-
ment was caused by accident or carelessness 
that the employer could not reasonably an-
ticipate. 
§ 541.707 Occasional tasks. 
Occasional, infrequently recurring tasks 
that cannot practicably be performed by 
nonexempt employees, but are the means for 
an exempt employee to properly carry out 
exempt functions and responsibilities, are 
considered exempt work. The following fac-
tors should be considered in determining 
whether such work is exempt work: Whether 
the same work is performed by any of the ex-
empt employee’s subordinates; practicability 
of delegating the work to a nonexempt em-
ployee; whether the exempt employee per-
forms the task frequently or occasionally; 
and existence of an industry practice for the 
exempt employee to perform the task. 
§ 541.708 Combination exemptions. 
Employees who perform a combination of 
exempt duties as set forth in the regulations 
in this part for executive, administrative, 
professional, øoutside sales¿ and computer 
employees may qualify for exemption. Thus, 
for example, an employee whose primary 
duty involves a combination of exempt ad-
ministrative and exempt executive work 
may qualify for exemption. In other words, 
work that is exempt under one section of 
this part will not defeat the exemption under 
any other section. 
ø§ 541.709 Motion picture producing industry. 
The requirement that the employee be paid 
‘‘on a salary basis’’ does not apply to an em-
ployee in the motion picture producing in-
dustry who is compensated at a base rate of 
at least $1,043 per week (exclusive of board, 
lodging, or other facilities). Thus, an em-
ployee in this industry who is otherwise ex-
empt under subparts B, C, or D of this part, 
and who is employed at a base rate of at 
least 
the 
applicable 
current 
minimum 
amount a week is exempt if paid a propor-
tionate amount (based on a week of not more 
than 6 days) for any week in which the em-
ployee does not work a full workweek for 
any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt 
employee in this industry qualifies for ex-
emption if the employee is employed at a 
daily 
rate 
under 
the 
following 
cir-
cumstances: 
(a) The employee is in a job category for 
which a weekly base rate is not provided and 
the daily base rate would yield at least the 
minimum weekly amount if 6 days were 
worked; or 
(b) The employee is in a job category hav-
ing the minimum weekly base rate and the 
daily base rate is at least one-sixth of such 
weekly base rate.¿ 
§ 541.710 Employees of public agencies. 
(a) An employee of a public agency who 
otherwise meets the salary basis require-
ments of § 541.602 shall not be disqualified 
from 
exemption 
under 
§§ 541.100, 
541.200, 
541.300 or 541.400 on the basis that such em-
ployee is paid according to a pay system es-
tablished by statute, ordinance or regula-
tion, or by a policy or practice established 
pursuant to principles of public account-
ability, under which the employee accrues 
personal leave and sick leave and which re-
quires the public agency employee’s pay to 
be reduced or such employee to be placed on 
leave without pay for absences for personal 
reasons or because of illness or injury of less 
than one work-day when accrued leave is not 
used by an employee because: 
(1) Permission for its use has not been 
sought or has been sought and denied; 
(2) Accrued leave has been exhausted; or 
(3) The employee chooses to use leave with-
out pay. 
(b) Deductions from the pay of an em-
ployee of a public agency for absences due to 
a budget-required furlough shall not dis-
qualify the employee from being paid on a 
salary basis except in the workweek in which 
the furlough occurs and for which the em-
ployee’s pay is accordingly reduced.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Lael Brainard, 
of the District of Columbia, to be Vice 
Chairman of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System for a term 
of four years. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we 
begin this 5-week work period, Senate 
Democrats’ focus will remain the same 
as it has been since last year: fighting 
inflation and lowering costs for Amer-
ican families. 
At times, we will pursue this goal 
through legislation, as has been the 
case with our competition bill, with 
legislation to reform shipping practices 
that we passed recently, or finding 
ways to lower prescription drug costs. 
And to that end, today, the Agri-
culture Committee is also holding a 
hearing 
on 
legislation 
to 
improve 
transparency in meat prices. 
In addition to legislation, Senate 
Democrats will also help lower costs by 
confirming the right people to serve in 
the Federal Government. On that note, 
we will aim today to finish the con-
firmation of Lael Brainard to serve as 
Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors. 
Soon, the Senate will also work to 
confirm another very important nomi-
nee: Mr. Alvaro Bedoya to serve as 
Commissioner of the FTC, the Federal 
Trade Commission. Of all the Agencies 
in the Federal Government, the FTC is 
among the best equipped for protecting 
Americans from price gougers, manipu-
lators, and those trying to rip off 
American consumers—or at least the 
FTC would be, if it had full member-
ship. But, sadly, the FTC has been 
stuck at a 2–2 deadlock for well over a 
year, rendering it incapable of exe-
cuting the full breadth of its agenda. 
We have had two Democrats, two Re-
publicans. The Republican nominees 
have resisted going after Big Oil and so 
many of the other excesses of corporate 
America. And who pays the price? In a 
very literal sense, it is American con-
sumers as they see prices rise on every-
thing from groceries to the number 
that pops up every time they fill up 
their tank. 
But the story is grossly different in 
corporate America, and an FTC with 
full membership could shine a light as 
to why. While Americans across the 
board are making sacrifices to support 
themselves and their families, cor-
porate America is raking in record 
profits. 
As one article from Yahoo Finance 
summarized earlier this year, cor-
porate America’s 2021 profits were 
higher than ever.

America’s 
profits 
were 
higher than ever. 
Perhaps no sector has evoked more 
frustration and anger from the Amer-
ican people as the largest oil and gas 
companies and the prices they are 
charging. 
Last year, the top 25 oil and gas com-
panies reported $205 billion in profits. 
Where has that money gone? To help 
American consumers? No way. To ease 
our energy troubles? Not at all. 
According to one news source yester-
day, 28 of the largest oil and gas com-
panies gave out $394 million in CEO 
compensation. And in the fourth quar-
ter last year, stock buybacks among 
these companies rose by more than 
2,000 percent—2,000 percent. 
All this extra money they are mak-
ing they put in the pockets of the CEOs 
and the wealthy shareholders who 
dominate in the oil company owner-
ship. Just think about that. Americans 
are paying more and more at the pump 
and struggling to afford the basics, and 
oil companies, which are seeing their 
highest profits in years, prefer to re-
ward 
executives 
and 
shareholders 
through corporate buybacks instead of 
American families. 
Once we have an FTC with full mem-
bership, they will finally have the will, 
the means, and the power to look under 
the hood of America’s energy sector 
and shine a much needed light on why 
Big Oil is pumping out record profits, 
even as consumers struggle. 
So completing the membership of the 
FTC will be a priority, and we will 
work to finish the confirmation process 
of Mr. Bedoya as soon as we can. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, on Ukraine, later this 
week, President Biden is expected to 
send Congress another request for 
emergency funding to support the peo-
ple of Ukraine in their fight against 
Russian aggression. 
When the President makes his re-
quest, the Senate should be ready to 
work quickly to approve this funding. 
Every penny of American aid has been 
money well spent. 
This fight, in a real sense, is about 
tyranny versus democracy itself. It is a 
Manichaean struggle. 
It has been 2 months since Vladimir 
Putin began his immoral and savage 
war against the Ukrainian people. You 
see the pictures; it breaks your heart. 
It breaks your heart; savagery—sav-
agery—of Mr. Putin killing women and 
children, innocent people. 
So far, though, things have gone dis-
astrously for Russian troops as hopes 
for a quick invasion have been all but 
dashed. The Ukrainian people, forced 
into a war not of their choosing and 
having suffered losses of inhumane pro-
portions, have given Putin a much 
tougher fight than he ever bargained 
for, 
than 
he 
ever 
imagined. 
Out-
numbered and out-equipped, the brav-
ery and valiance of the Ukrainian peo-
ple remain unbroken. Putin, mean-
while, is increasingly the most isolated 
leader in the world. Although, par-
enthetically, shame on the world lead-
ers who are playing footsie with him, 
including China. 
But the Ukrainian people still need 
our help. Sadly, this fight seems far 
from over, and losses from the Ukrain-
ian people have been severe. 
The United States has a moral obli-
gation to help the Ukrainian people 
with the tools they need for as long as 
they need them. Again, this is about 
tyranny versus democracy itself. 
In which direction will the world 
turn in this, the 21st century? 
Once the President makes his request 
to Congress, approving additional aid 
for Ukraine will be a must. I expect 
both sides to work with swift, bipar-
tisan cooperation to get it done. 
I also expect the Senate to move 
quickly on the nomination of President 
Biden’s choice for our Ambassador to 
Ukraine, Bridget Brink. Ms. Brink’s 
nomination is terrific news that comes 
at a critical moment. She is deeply ex-
perienced. She has already won bipar-
tisan support in this Chamber and is 
very much needed as the United States 
seeks to strengthen our diplomatic ties 
to the war-torn nation. Ms. Brink’s 
nomination will be a top priority of the 
Senate once she comes before the 
Chamber. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on COVID relief: fi-
nally, there is another issue in which 
Republicans must work with Demo-
crats—passing another round of COVID 
relief. 
COVID funding is not a matter of 
‘‘nice to have if we can afford it.’’ 
COVID funding is a must-have. It is 
something our Nation cannot possibly 
afford to go without. 
Yesterday, the White House made 
clear that other countries like Japan, 
the Philippines, and Vietnam are al-
ready in front of us when it comes to 
purchasing new vaccines and treat-
ments. American companies, with their 
ingenuity, come up with these vaccines 
and treatment; but because we are un-
willing—our Republican colleagues so 
far have blocked financing this—other 
countries are going to buy from us. 
We don’t want to be in a position in 
the fall where we desperately need 
these medicines but our companies 
have signed contracts with other coun-
tries—other countries. That would be a 
huge mistake. 
Given our Federal budget, it is a 
small amount to ask that we provide 
money for these therapeutics so that 
we can have them for our country, for 
our folks, as much as the rest of the 
world may need them, so that we have 
vaccines—the best vaccines—developed 
and ready to go and so we have enough 
testing and treatment. 
But 
other 
countries 
are 
beating 
America to the punch because Repub-
licans have blocked the Senate from 
approving new funding. The answer to 
avoiding another shutdown of our com-
munities is very simple: Senate Repub-
licans should work with us to quickly 
pass another round of COVID funding. 
It is not more complicated than that. 
Let me say it again. If we want to 
keep life as close to normal down the 
line, if we want to keep schools and 
churches and businesses open if, God 
forbid, 
another 
aggressive 
variant 
arises, Republicans should work with 
us to approve more money for vaccines, 
testing, and lifesaving therapeutics. 
The longer that Senate Republicans 
hold out on working with us to approve 
new funding, the higher the cost will be 
for our country down the line. And 
when we don’t get back to normal, we 
can’t stay at normal because of a new 
variant, people will know what hap-
pened. 
God forbid that happens. We don’t 
want it to happen. We want them to 
work with us; but, unfortunately, so 
far, we are not seeing that cooperation. 
From some we have, I must be clear. I 
had good discussions with several of 
our Republicans, but then it was 
blocked by the Republican leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Biden administration’s bad decisions 
have brought many crises upon our 
country. One of the worst is the col-
lapse of law and order on our southern 
border. 
Last month, Customs and Border 
Protection reported over 221,000 appre-
hensions. That is up 33 percent just 
since February. It is the highest 
monthly total in 22 years. We have al-
ready hit more than 1 million encoun-
ters in just the first half of this fiscal 
year. But, alas, this could still be just 
the beginning. The Department of 
Homeland Security is bracing for an 
even bigger surge in the weeks and 
months to come. Authorities are steel-
ing for the possibility that we could see 
18,000 new people showing up every sin-
gle day. 
In 2020, President-elect Biden said 
that ‘‘end[ing] up with two million peo-
ple on our border’’ would be ‘‘the last 
thing we need,’’ but his own policies 
went on to produce exactly that out-
come. 
In 2021, on President Biden’s watch, 2 
million people from at least—listen to 
this—160 
different 
countries 
were 
stopped along our southern border, and 
now immigration officials are antici-
pating totals that could more than tri-
ple—triple—last year’s record. 
Against this backdrop, with illegal 
immigrants and deadly fentanyl pour-
ing into our country, any administra-
tion living in reality would be working 
overtime to actually secure the border. 
Instead, even now, President Biden is 
trying to throw away what little secu-
rity still exists. 
For 2 years, since the start of the 
pandemic, a legal authority called title 
42 has empowered the government to 
simply turn around a large share of the 
people they catch and send them right 
back where they came from. Every

month, CBP uses this tool to keep tens 
of thousands of illegal immigrants out 
of the catch-and-release pipeline and 
send them back to their home coun-
tries, but now, unbelievably, President 
Biden has announced he is going to 
cancel 
these 
legal 
authorities. 
He 
wants to rip off the one remaining 
bandaid that has preserved at least 
some shred of law and order. 
The Biden administration is claiming 
the pandemic is over and finished on 
our southern border. Now, they don’t 
believe the pandemic is over, however, 
for American citizens—oh, no. Demo-
crats actually want Congress to ap-
prove more funding specifically be-
cause COVID is not finished. The Biden 
administration’s official position is 
that the pandemic is over for illegal 
immigrants but not for the American 
people. 
Every day brings more confusing spin 
from President Biden and his staff. 
Their latest claim is that Congress 
needs to fix their problem for them— 
that if these title 42 authorities end 
after President Biden has announced he 
will end them, it will somehow be 
Congress’s fault. That is absurd. The 
administration has the discretion. The 
legislative branch has already given 
them the tool. It is the same tool they 
have been using this whole time. They 
just need to have the courage to tell 
the radical left to take a hike and keep 
sending these folks back to their home 
countries. Apparently, that is asking 
too much. 
The Biden administration is stum-
bling through this core governing re-
sponsibility with no vision, no plan, 
and backward priorities. Democrats 
would rather appease their radical base 
with functional open borders than con-
duct the bare minimum—bare min-
imum—in enforcement. 
The administration’s decision is so 
obviously crazy that even a number of 
our Senate Democratic colleagues who 
have been marching in lockstep with 
the President for more than a year are 
now scrambling to make it look like 
they are breaking ranks. 
Well, I welcome our colleagues who 
are finally making angry noises about 
this border crisis. The problem is that 
their lockstep, Democratic votes for 
over a year have helped, actually, to 
produce it. For over a year, Senate 
Democrats have rubberstamped every 
single aspect of the Biden administra-
tion’s failed border policy. Not a single 
Senate Democrat opposed the con-
firmations of the heads of DHS and 
HHS, who have presided over this cri-
sis. Not a single Senate Democrat 
voted for commonsense Republican 
amendments to do things like preserve 
the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy and 
defund sanctuary cities, and the cost of 
their bad decisions gets worse every 
day. 
Last week, a heroic American serv-
icemember paid the ultimate price. 
Specialist Bishop E. Evans of the Texas 
National Guard had been assigned to 
help contend with the flow of immi-
grants across the Rio Grande. He lost 
his own life in trying to save people 
who had gotten into deadly trouble. 
And the White House’s response? Their 
spokeswoman 
was 
asked 
yesterday 
about this tragic loss. She brushed it 
off. She said he was there on behalf of 
Texas, not the Federal Government. 
That unbelievably tone-deaf response 
perfectly captures the administration’s 
failure to take responsibility. 
Democrats have built this border cri-
sis by letting the radical left run the 
show for more than a year. If my 
friends across the aisle really have ex-
perienced a conversion of heart and 
now believe in border security, they 
will have to do a lot more than issue 
indignant press releases and call it a 
day. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I were 
to ask you ‘‘How did you start your 
day?’’ I would imagine you would have 
your own answer. 
Most people would say: Oh, I made a 
cup of coffee. I took the dog out for a 
walk. I went for a run. 
Another answer might come to mind: 
Oh, I took my vitamin tablet, my die-
tary supplement. 
In fact, 77 percent of people in Amer-
ica take a dietary supplement, includ-
ing me. I take a multivitamin tablet. I 
don’t know if it does me any good. I 
figure it won’t do me any harm. I be-
lieve in it. I believe Americans ought 
to be able to make that choice. 
I also believe that Americans who 
take vitamins, minerals, and herbs for 
their health and well-being have a 
right to know what is in them—pretty 
basic. 
Many people assume if that product 
is sold in the United States of America, 
somebody has inspected it, and it must 
be safe. Unfortunately, that is not al-
ways true. 
The Food and Drug Administration 
has the authority to regulate dietary 
supplements and take dangerous prod-
ucts off the market, but it lacks infor-
mation that it needs to use this au-
thority effectively. 
The Food and Drug Administration 
can’t even tell us how many dietary 
supplements are sold in America. They 
give us a range: somewhere between 
50,000 different dietary supplements 
and 80,000—50,000 and 80,000—a gap of 
30,000 products? What is going on here? 
They don’t even know how many prod-
ucts are being sold, let alone what they 
are or what is in them. 
Let’s go back to 1994. That was the 
year Congress passed a law and gave 
the FDA the authority to regulate sup-
plements. Now, we all know that the 
Food and Drug Administration has the 
most important responsibility when it 
comes to the drugs that we take to 
make sure they are two things: safe 
and effective—safe and effective. 
But what about dietary supplements? 
Well, 
we 
passed 
something 
called 
DSHEA, 
the 
Dietary 
Supplement 
Health and Education Act. The law 
made some progress, but there was a 
problem with it. Manufacturers of die-
tary supplements—get this now—man-
ufacturers of those vitamins and min-
erals that are for sale in all those shops 
and all those drugstores are not re-
quired to tell the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration what products they are 
selling in the United States, under 
what names. They are not required to 
disclose to the FDA what is in those 
products or where they are manufac-
tured. And believe me, a lot of them 
are manufactured outside the United 
States. So when it comes to dietary 
supplements, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration and American consumers 
are pretty much flying blind. 
Making matters worse, since 1994, 
this dietary supplement industry has 
grown dramatically. Listen to these 
figures. In 1994, there were 4,000 dietary 
supplements sold in the United States. 
Today, as I said earlier, the number is 
as high as 80,000. So in 27, 30 years, we 
have seen the number of dietary sup-
plements for sale go from 4,000 to 
80,000. 
Now, in 1994, dietary supplements 
were a $4 billion industry—today, over 
$50 billion in annual revenue. 
Let me give you an example of one 
ingredient sold in dietary supplements 
today in the United States. It is called 
tianeptine. It can produce opioid-like 
effects. It is a prescription anti-depres-
sant in some countries, but it is not ap-
proved for any use in the United States 
of America. Yet it is inexpensive and 
easy to produce. Some have nicknamed 
it ‘‘gas station heroin’’ because you 
can buy it easily at gas stations across 
America. You can buy it online—one 
click, delivered to your door. 
It is marketed as a safe supplement 
that can improve users’ moods and en-
hance concentration. How many ads do 
you see on television—maybe I am pay-
ing closer attention to them these 
days—that say: Take this supplement, 
and your memory is better. You can 
concentrate more. 
You are smiling, Mr. President, be-
cause we have all seen them. They are 
on television all the time. 
It is marketed also as a way to fight 
substance 
use 
disorders, 
this 
tianeptine. So last year, Consumer Re-
ports—and I respect this magazine very 
much—published the results of an in-
vestigation it conducted into this sup-
plement. It told the story of a Michi-
gan woman who had used heroin for 10 
years and survived countless overdoses 
and arrests. After her sister overdosed 
and died, she decided it was time to get 
clean. She was frightened. She was des-
perate enough to try anything. She

heard about tianeptine—maybe that 
could help her—so she tried it. She be-
came hooked and dangerously ill, end-
ing up in the hospital with a dangerous 
infection called sepsis. 
One doctor said to her: ‘‘I don’t know 
if I can save your limbs, but I’ll try.’’ 
Another doctor told her she came with-
in a day or two of dying. 
She was lucky. She survived. She 
now speaks publicly about the dangers 
of the product that nearly killed her. 
In her words, ‘‘This is heroin times 
1,000, and it’s very devastating. It’s 
life-destroying. I don’t really know 
how to put into words how horrible this 
substance is.’’ 
In the midst of a deadly opioid epi-
demic and a COVID pandemic, some 
unscrupulous characters are hustling 
to make a buck off of people’s pain by 
selling them an unregulated product 
that might make them sick or even 
kill them. And the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration lacks the basic knowl-
edge, the basic information it needs to 
go after the people who are peddling 
these dangerous, life-threatening prod-
ucts. 
When asked about the situation, a 
Food and Drug Administration spokes-
man said the Agency has ‘‘no system-
atic way of knowing what dietary sup-
plement products are on the market.’’ 
Think of that. The No. 1 Agency in 
the Federal Government, which you as-
sume is taking a look at these products 
that you are buying at the vitamins 
and minerals store, has no way of 
knowing what is even for sale. As a re-
sult, the FDA, she said, is ‘‘left trying 
to play catch-up’’ after the bad results 
occur. 
This week, Senator BRAUN of Indiana 
and I are introducing a bipartisan bill 
to protect Americans by requiring sup-
plement 
manufacturers 
to 
register 
their products with the Food and Drug 
Administration. Our bill would require 
dietary supplement manufacturers to 
provide the FDA—listen to the infor-
mation we are asking—the names of 
their products, the ingredients they 
contain, an electronic copy of the 
label, a list of any health claims that 
they have made, and more. All of this 
information would be available to con-
sumers—so Americans have the right 
to know. 
If there is a problem with a supple-
ment, the FDA could quickly check the 
database to see what other products 
might contain the same ingredients 
and warn innocent consumers. 
Dietary 
supplement 
makers 
who 
refuse to register with the FDA would 
see their products misbranded, and 
FDA should be given the appropriate 
authority to take action against them. 
Now, I have been down this road be-
fore. I wanted to make sure that the di-
etary supplement manufacturers, when 
we had a report of an adverse event— 
somebody took their pill, thinking it 
was a harmless vitamin or mineral 
that might help them; it turned out to 
be dangerous; they got really sick or 
died—they had to report it. 
I worked on the floor for years to get 
that passed into law. My nemesis, my 
challenger on the whole issue, was the 
late Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch. 
Eventually, we worked out an agree-
ment. Adverse event reporting was re-
quired. 
Now, I might argue that it never 
worked quite as we expected it to, but 
at least it was an effort to alert people 
that sometimes what looks like an in-
nocent vitamin or mineral can be dan-
gerous. And the notion that the gov-
ernment has already checked it out is 
just plain wrong, as I have said here. 
But that was then. 
I will tell you what happened. I went 
into vitamin stores in the State of Illi-
nois and saw my picture on every cash 
register. I was enemy No. 1 because I 
asked that dangerous supplements be 
reported to the government if some-
body got sick when they took them. 
But having said that, I want to make 
something very clear about the dif-
ference the legislation Senator BRAUN 
and I have introduced will face. I have 
been through this, as I said. I proposed 
a change about 10 years ago, and the 
dietary supplement industry hated me. 
They fought me tooth and nail. They 
hated my idea like the devil hates holy 
water. 
In the year since Senator BRAUN and 
I started talking to them about this 
new bill, there has been a significant 
change, and I want to salute the indus-
try for this change. A strong majority 
of the dietary supplement industry now 
supports responsible reporting require-
ments and stronger protections. Hats 
off to them. 
The industry’s largest trade associa-
tion, the Council for Responsible Nutri-
tion, has endorsed our bill. Other trade 
associations support enhanced report-
ing requirements, generally. We hope 
these groups will join us in the effort. 
Responsible dietary supplement man-
ufacturers should welcome this because 
the people who are abusing the market 
and endangering consumers are giving 
them a bad name. We are also glad for 
the support of Pew Charitable Trusts, 
which has worked diligently for years 
to protect consumers. 
Our bill will give the FDA what they 
must have: the information to protect 
Americans from dangerous products 
being sold as health supplements. Our 
bill will give them the information and 
the power. 
We urge our colleagues to join us in 
passing it as soon as possible. It is a 
commonsense, bipartisan compromise 
that will protect consumers’ health 
and save lives. 
The bottom line is, I am willing to 
fight to protect every Americans’ right 
to buy safe dietary supplements. It 
may help them; it may not. That is not 
my judgment. Each individual con-
sumer should make that choice. As 
long as that dietary supplement is not 
dangerous to you or to Americans, as 
long as we know that it is for sale, who 
made it, what is in it, I think that 
basic information is what the govern-
ment should gather. 
The vast majority of these supple-
ments will not harm people, and the di-
etary supplement manufacturers know 
that, and that is why they are sup-
porting our effort. I hope that more of 
my colleagues will join this bipartisan 
undertaking. 
ARMY HUMVEE SAFETY AND TRAINING 
Mr. President, I watched a troubling 
program on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ back in Feb-
ruary. It detailed military tactical ve-
hicle accidents. The report highlighted 
a terrible problem that has resulted in 
rollovers and other serious accidents 
involving the Army’s most ubiquitous 
vehicle, the humvee. 
Some of the safety upgrades, such as 
armor kits and other upgrades, that 
are designed to protect our warfighters 
in humvees during combat from IEDs 
or other threats can, in fact, make the 
humvees less stable and more prone to 
rollovers. Here is what it boiled down 
to. 
When we went into Iraq with our 
humvees, we ran into these IEDs, these 
explosive devices that were set on the 
side of the road. They were triggered 
when humvees came by. They blew up 
these humvees and killed the occu-
pants—military personnel from the 
United States—and they also maimed 
many of them as well. 
The first soldier I visited, after our 
invasion of Iraq, out at Walter Reed 
was a sergeant from the Ohio National 
Guard who had lost half of one leg as a 
result of one of these IED explosions 
while he drove a humvee. So we de-
cided to do something about it. 
It was a dramatic emergency under-
taking to put armored plating on the 
sides of these humvees so as they went 
down the road when these explosive de-
vices went off, it would protect the 
people sitting inside. I know that it 
was an effort to do this as quickly as 
possible because the Rock Iron Arsenal 
in the State of Illinois jumped to the 
challenge and really responded in a 
matter of weeks, putting armored plat-
ing on the humvees. 
Now, what happened, of course, is 
when we put that weighted plating on 
the sides to protect the occupants, it 
changed the camber and the balance of 
these vehicles, and many of them start-
ed being involved in rollover accidents. 
So by solving one problem, we intro-
duced instability into the vehicle that 
haunted us and created more problems 
and even deaths. 
In fact, just last year, the GAO re-
ported that more than 3,750 noncombat 
accidents as a result of tactical vehicle 
accidents in the Army and Marine 
Corps occurred between fiscal years 
2010 and 2019. At least 123 servicemem-
bers died as a result of such accidents 
during the same timeframe. 
Since then, the Army has pursued a 
number of improvements, including 
training for safety officers and inspec-
tions as part of their tactical vehicle 
driver’s training. That has helped the 
situation. 
The Army is also working to incor-
porate a variety of safe upgrades to

both brandnew and recently produced 
humvees, including anti-lock brake 
and electronic stability control safe 
kits to help prevent rollovers and acci-
dents. 
In fact, since 2017, all new Army 
humvees already have these safety kits 
installed. This includes humvees pro-
cured as part of our partnership at 
Rock Island Arsenal, where the safety 
kits are actually part of the integrated 
chassis system delivered to the arsenal. 
As the Army continues its joint light 
tactical vehicle procurement strategy, 
the humvee will continue to be the 
workhorse of the future—the Army 
tactical wheeled vehicle fleet is led by 
these units with over 50,000 in service— 
for decades to come. As such, we owe it 
to the fighting forces to give them 
newer, safer humvees. And we must en-
sure that recently produced humvees 
currently in the fleet, those used 
across combat and training and other 
operational capabilities, are updated 
with safety kits. 
The Army is also reviewing addi-
tional safety upgrades—such as airbags 
and restraint systems—that can help 
save lives as well. 
All of these critical investments 
must be made in parallel. The ‘‘60 Min-
utes’’ piece has made clear the risks 
and costs. This is a clear call to action 
for all of us in Congress. The FY22 om-
nibus included $183 million for more 
safety kits on existing humvees. I look 
forward to continuing to work with the 
Army on further efforts to make the 
humvee safer and to keep our promise 
to protect the lives of our men and 
women in uniform. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Satur-
day, we lost a remarkable former col-
league: Senator Orrin Hatch. 
Orrin rose from poverty to become 
one of the longest serving Senators in 
U.S. history and the longest serving 
Republican Senator ever. During his 
more than 40-year Senate career, he 
built a record of accomplishment that 
included landmark legislation like the 
Americans with Disabilities Act; the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act, which 
he authored with his close friend from 
across the aisle, Senator Ted Kennedy. 
At the time of Orrin’s retirement, no 
Senator alive had had as many pieces 
of legislation signed into law. 
I was privileged to serve under 
Orrin’s leadership at the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, one of three influen-
tial Senate committees that he chaired 
during his tenure in the Senate. In ad-
dition to being an outstanding legis-
lator and a principled conservative, 
Orrin Hatch was also a cherished and 
good-humored colleague and a deeply 
kind human being. It is no surprise 
that his friendships spanned both sides 
of the aisle or that both the Democrat 
and Republican leaders paid tribute to 
him yesterday. 
Mr. President, I know I speak for 
more than myself when I say that I 
have missed his presence in the Senate. 
His death is a loss for our country and 
especially for his beloved State of 
Utah, which he served so faithfully and 
so well during his long career. 
My thoughts and prayers this week 
are with Orrin’s wife of more than 64 
years, Elaine, with Orrin’s six children, 
and with his dozens of grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, the first year of 
Democratic governance in Washington 
has produced surging inflation, a disas-
trous withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
and a massive border crisis. And, unfor-
tunately, so far 2022 isn’t looking much 
better. Our inflation crisis keeps get-
ting worse, energy prices are soaring, 
and the Biden border crisis is reaching 
new heights. 
When President Biden took office, in-
flation was 1.4 percent, well within the 
Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate 
of 2 percent; and it might have re-
mained there had Democrats not de-
cided to pass a $1.9 trillion partisan 
spending spree under the guise of 
COVID relief—mere weeks, I might 
add, after Congress had approved a 
fifth bipartisan COVID relief bill that 
met essentially all current pressing 
COVID needs. 
The Democrats’ decision to flood the 
economy with unnecessary government 
money set off an inflation crisis that 
shows little sign of stopping. March 
saw inflation hit 8.5 percent, a 40-year 
high. Everywhere Americans look, they 
are paying more: more for groceries, 
more for gas, more for utilities, more 
for furniture, more for used cars and 
trucks—and the list goes on. 
While wages increased in 2021, infla-
tion outstripped wage growth, which 
means that instead of a pay increase, 
many Americans saw a de facto pay 
cut. Needless to say, inflation is having 
the biggest impact on those who can 
least afford it. 
The President likes to tout job cre-
ation and economic growth—although 
most of what he takes credit for is the 
natural consequence of economic re-
covery after the pandemic—but his 
claims mean little to families who are 
wondering how they will be able to pay 
their soaring grocery bills or whether 
they can afford the gas that they need 
for the rest of the month. 
And 
speaking 
of 
affording 
gas, 
thanks to Democrats, we are also rap-
idly approaching a full-blown energy 
crisis. Gas prices increased on average 
to an alltime high in March, according 
to AAA, and that is on top of the soar-
ing inflationary costs of electricity and 
home gas services, among other energy 
commodities. As of yesterday, gas was 
$4.12 a gallon, up from $2.39 a gallon 
when President Biden took office. The 
administration, 
of 
course, 
has 
at-
tempted to blame this hike on Putin, 
but the vast majority of the 72-percent 
increase in gas prices since President 
Biden took office predates the war in 
Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. 
Every gallon of gas purchased at cur-
rent prices hits family budgets hard, 
especially in rural States like South 
Dakota where driving long distances is 
the norm. Diesel averaged $2.68 a gal-
lon in January of 2021. As of yesterday, 
it was $5.07. That not only hits our 
transportation sector and truckers but 
farmers across the country as they 
plant their fields this spring. 
There is no easy solution on infla-
tion, but the first imperative is to do 
no more harm. Once Democrats saw 
the inflationary effects of their $1.9 
trillion spending bill, they should have 
instantly resolved to refrain from any 
more unnecessary government spend-
ing. Big spending, however, is a way of 
life for Democrats. So instead of com-
mitting to spending restraint, they 
spent last fall pushing for a second 
massive spending spree that would 
have made our inflation situation that 
much worse. And while that reckless 
tax-and-spending spree was mercifully 
halted in the Senate last December, 
the President’s recent budget request 
made clear that Democrats are still in-
tent on implementing many of their 
tax-and-spending spree’s measures. 
That is right. Democrats unleashed 
the worst inflation in 40 years by flood-
ing the economy with unnecessary gov-
ernment money, and they still want to 
double down on that strategy. If Demo-
crats have their way on government 
spending, our inflation crisis could last 
for years to come. 
Mr. President, while there are few 
things the President and Democrats 
can do to speed up the end of their self- 
inflicted inflation crisis other than not 
making it worse, there are actions that 
Democrats can take to address the 
high energy costs that Americans are 
facing, and chief among those things is 
unleashing American energy produc-
tion of both alternative and conven-
tional 
energy. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
President seems pretty committed to 
doing the opposite when it comes to 
conventional energy. He has asked 
other countries to increase their con-
ventional energy production, but he 
has made it clear that he is not inter-
ested in seeing the United States do 
the same. 
While his administration is finally 
conducting sales for new onshore oil 
and gas leases, it has reduced the land 
available for such leases and substan-
tially increased the royalty rate, send-
ing a clear signal to American energy 
producers that the administration is 
reluctant to collaborate with it. Mean-
while, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission has proposed requiring 
costly new financial disclosures that 
would discourage investment in con-
ventional energy production.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2140 
April 26, 2022 
While Democrats may wish it weren’t 
so, the fact of the matter is that our 
country will still need oil and natural 
gas for years to come; and if Democrats 
and the President didn’t want Ameri-
cans to be paying sky-high prices to fill 
their cars, they need to focus on en-
couraging responsible oil and gas pro-
duction here at home, which, I might 
add, puts Americans to work in good- 
paying jobs and develops these re-
sources with fewer emissions than are 
produced in other countries. Forcing 
our country to increase our reliance on 
foreign energy sources will do nothing 
but drive up energy prices, not to men-
tion jeopardizing national security. 
Boosting domestic production, on the 
other hand, would drive down energy 
prices while ensuring that we don’t 
have to rely on dictators or unstable 
countries for energy. 
In addition to our energy and infla-
tion crises, we are also facing a mas-
sive crisis at the southern border. Al-
most from the day the President took 
office, we have seen a huge surge in the 
number of individuals attempting to il-
legally make their way across the 
southern border. In March alone, U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection en-
countered 221,303 individuals attempt-
ing to cross our southern border ille-
gally. In the first quarter of 2022, more 
than half a million individuals were ap-
prehended while trying to get across 
our southern border. And the influx 
shows no signs of stopping. 
And what has the President done to 
address this crisis? Next to nothing. In 
fact, the truth is that this is a crisis 
largely of the President’s own making. 
The series of actions that he has taken 
to weaken border security and immi-
gration enforcement has encouraged a 
flood of illegal immigration across our 
southern border. In fact, the Presi-
dent’s lawyers are over at the Supreme 
Court today arguing against a measure 
to discourage illegal immigration. 
And now the President is on track to 
make our current border crisis much 
worse by lifting title 42 COVID–19 re-
strictions that have provided for the 
immediate deportation of individuals 
who have crossed the border illegally. 
Once these restrictions are lifted, the 
Department of Homeland Security ex-
pects as many as 18,000 migrants per 
day—18,000 per day—to attempt to 
cross our southern border. 
I mentioned that we have seen more 
than half a million attempted illegal 
crossings in the first 3 months of this 
year. Without title 42 restrictions, we 
could be seeing more than half a mil-
lion attempted crossings each month, 
and it is clear that the President has 
no substantive plan in place to deal 
with such a surge. 
I was relieved—as I think a lot of 
Americans were and I think a lot of 
Democrats, honestly, here in the Sen-
ate—that yesterday a Federal judge 
issued an order temporarily preserving 
title 42. But this is not a permanent so-
lution to the problem. Title 42 should 
not be lifted until the President has a 
robust plan in place for discouraging il-
legal immigration, securing our border, 
preventing human trafficking and drug 
trafficking, 
and 
quickly 
deporting 
those who seek to illegally enter our 
country. 
So here is where we are, Mr. Presi-
dent: We have an inflation crisis that is 
driving up costs for American families. 
We have an energy crisis, with sky- 
high gas prices fueling pain at the 
pump. And we have a security, humani-
tarian, and enforcement crisis at our 
southern border. That is what a year 
and a quarter of Democratic govern-
ance looks like. 
And since Democrats show no signs 
of taking steps to address these crises, 
that is what Democratic governance is 
likely to look like for the foreseeable 
future. Meanwhile, the American peo-
ple will continue to pay the price. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll.

Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

REMEMBERING JOHNNIE JONES 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today 
my State and I think the entire coun-
try should both mourn the loss and cel-
ebrate the life of an American hero and 
dedicated civil rights leader—Johnnie 
Jones, who recently died at age 102 but 
in his 102 years fought for our country, 
fought for the free world, and also 
fought to bring civil rights to a better 
place. 
During World War II, Johnnie Jones 
helped storm the beaches of Normandy 
as part of D-day, liberate France from 
Nazi occupation—along the way, being 
part of the Battle of the Bulge. He was 
injured during the D-day invasion when 
his ship hit a mine, and he suffered 
shrapnel wounds from German air at-
tacks, but he never stopped fighting. 
When he came back, he attended 
Southern Law School and then led civil 
rights efforts in Baton Rouge. He le-
gally represented the organizers at the 
Baton Rouge bus boycott, which served 
as a forerunner or a template for the 
Montgomery bus boycott. Throughout 
his career, he took on several civil 
rights cases, advocating for equality 
under the law, and served a term in the 
Louisiana House of Representatives. 
His commitment to service and his 
love of our country was not just admi-
rable but inspiring. 
Last year, I had the honor to present 
him with a Purple Heart for the 
wounds he received during the D-day 
invasion in 1944. 
My grandson has been to the World 
War II Museum in New Orleans—a tre-
mendous museum—and he is now very 
much into the heroism of our soldiers 
who were in both World War II and 
World War I. So I took my grandson to 
meet Mr. Jones because I wanted him 
to meet a real-life hero. 
Here you see him at 102—so proud of 
his medals, saluting. 
My grandson, just the other day, 
said: Papaw, remind me of that man we 
met. So his meeting Mr. Jones 2 years 
ago has inspired a 7-year-old to live his 
life a better way. 
So, as Mr. Jones salutes us, shall we 
all be inspired, shall we always remem-
ber the heroism abroad and the her-
oism here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
EARTH DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Lady 
Bird Johnson said, ‘‘The environment 
is where we all meet, where we all have 
a mutual interest; it is the one thing 
all of us share.’’ 
This quote from when she served as 
First Lady of the United States during 
President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s 
time in office, from 1963 to 1969, still 
resonates with us today as we com-
memorate Earth Day 2022 and reflect 
on our relationship with nature and the 
world we share with each of us every 
day. 
April 22, 1970, marked the first an-
nual Earth Day, which led to the for-
mation of the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency—the Agency that is re-
sponsible for implementing environ-
mental regulations and standards. 
We have made great strides in pro-
tecting the environment and public 
health through the Clean Air Act, 
Clean Water Act, and Endangered Spe-
cies Act, but the data and science sur-
rounding the harmful effects of climate 
change are alarming. Climate change is 
harming our ecosystems, waterways, 
forests, wildlife, and our general envi-
ronment. 
This year’s sustainable development 
goals theme and call to action is ‘‘In-
vest in Our Planet.’’ The question for 
climate action is no longer ‘‘if’’ or 
‘‘when’’ but ‘‘how much?’’ if we want to 
have a healthy, habitable Earth. 
Strong policies that protect our 
water resources, fisheries, and wildlife 
and address the challenges of climate 
change are a top priority of mine in my 
role as a member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
I applaud President Biden for setting 
forth ambitious but attainable cli-
mate-friendly goals, driven by science, 
to help preserve the health and safety 
of our planet and the public. I applaud 
President Biden’s Executive actions in 
January of 2021 to reverse steps Presi-
dent Trump took that weakened Fed-
eral protections under the Endangered 
Species 
Act. 
I 
applaud 
President 
Biden’s commitment to conserving 30 
percent of America’s lands and oceans 
by 2030, also known as the America the 
Beautiful Initiative. 
With the understanding that we need 
to meet the moment on climate change 
and preserve our planet, 
Congress 
passed the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act, which President Biden 
signed into law last November. This

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2141 
April 26, 2022 
historic legislation serves as a signifi-
cant downpayment on our future as we 
seek to strengthen resiliency and miti-
gation measures against flooding and 
sea level rise; shift towards greener, 
cleaner energy and technology; and 
form meaningful habits to clean up the 
world 
around 
us 
by 
recycling, 
composting, and disposing of waste 
products properly. 
The threat of sea level rise and 
warming temperatures is already detri-
mental to our coastlines and eco-
systems, especially along the Chesa-
peake Bay. With numerous and suc-
cessful restoration efforts underway, 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act authorizes an additional $238 mil-
lion to the Chesapeake Bay Program to 
make even bigger reductions in nutri-
ent pollution to improve water quality 
in the surrounding tributaries. 
In partnership with local jurisdic-
tions, stakeholders, and the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, the bipartisan in-
frastructure act will deliver $37.5 mil-
lion in Federal funding for the Mid- 
Chesapeake Bay Island Ecosystem Res-
toration Project. The purpose of the 
project is to rebuild the declining 
James and Barren Islands in Dor-
chester County and provide a substan-
tial increase of habitat for a variety of 
fish and wildlife species by repurposing 
dredged material from the shipping 
channels for the Port of Baltimore. 
This is beneficial use of dredged mate-
rial to keep our channels at the nec-
essary depth for commerce but do it in 
a way that restores our environment. 
Wetlands provide natural flood control 
solutions as climate change brings in-
creasingly frequent and severe weather 
events. 
We only have one planet, which is 
why every decision and every failure to 
act matters. 
I would like to thank our Federal 
workforce this Earth Day for its efforts 
to maximize this window for action on 
climate and environmental justice. The 
Biden administration has directed each 
Federal Agency to take strong action 
when it comes to dealing with our cli-
mate and environmental justice. Many 
civil servants are working around the 
clock to promulgate rules, strategy 
documents, and much, much more. For 
example, White House officials this 
month announced equity action plans 
for more than 90 Federal Agencies de-
signed to combat systemic barriers to 
opportunities in underserved commu-
nities. 
Each day of COP26 U.N. Climate 
Change Conference in Glasgow explored 
a new topic. Our Senate delegation had 
an opportunity to attend on the day 
that was devoted toward Nature Day. I 
mention that because our nature de-
pends upon us dealing with the climate 
agenda. 
I would just call to my colleagues’ 
attention the series that is hosted by 
former President Barack Obama, ‘‘Our 
Great National Parks.’’ Take a look at 
how important it is in preserving our 
environment for the species around us, 
which affects not only their ability to 
live but our ability to live. 
The month of April represents the 
opportunity to celebrate other related 
environmental and nature-focused holi-
days, such as Arbor Day, which falls on 
April 29 this year. My home State com-
memorated Maryland Arbor Day at the 
beginning of the month, on April 9. 
This year, we celebrate the 150th anni-
versary of Arbor Day. The goal of 
Arbor Day is to celebrate nature with-
in our communities by organizing tree 
planting or trash and litter cleanups. 
As President Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt remarked, ‘‘A nation that de-
stroys its soil destroys itself. Forests 
are the lungs of our land, purifying the 
air and giving fresh strength to our 
people.’’ 
The bipartisan infrastructure law 
also provides $275 million grant funding 
for the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s 
Post-Consumer 
Materials 
Management Infrastructure Grant Pro-
gram, which the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act 
established. This program will help 
prevent plastic waste from entering 
our environment in the first place. The 
program will provide grants to States 
to improve local waste management 
systems, including municipal recycling 
programs, 
and 
to 
improve 
postconsumer materials management 
and infrastructure to reduce plastic 
waste in our waterways and oceans, ul-
timately protecting our planet. 
I agree with Paul Hawken, who said 
this in a commencement address at the 
University of Portland in 2009: 
At present, we are stealing the future, sell-
ing it in the present, and calling it gross do-
mestic product. We can just as easily have 
an economy that is based on healing the fu-
ture instead of stealing it. We can either cre-
ate assets for the future or take the assets of 
the future. One is called restoration and the 
other [is called] exploitation. And whenever 
we exploit the earth we exploit people and 
cause untold suffering. Working for the earth 
is not a way to get rich, it is a way to be 
rich. 
Protecting our planet is a collective 
and ongoing effort. While we still have 
much to do, I am encouraged by the 
legislative and administrative progress 
we have made so far. I urge my col-
leagues to take the next step and pass 
the Build Back Better Act—trans-
formative legislation for a clean en-
ergy economy. 
This Earth Day, let us heed Paul 
Hawken’s comments: ‘‘Working for the 
earth is not a way to get rich, it is a 
way to be rich.’’ 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The clerk will call the roll.

mous consent that the order for the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

NOMINATION OF ALVARO M. BEDOYA 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, if the nanny 
state had a mascot, it would be the 
Federal Trade Commission. In fact, 
back in the 1970s, the FTC earned the 
nickname the ‘‘National Nanny’’—this, 
after it went on a rulemaking binge, 
one that triggered an unprecedented 
congressional response. 
In response to that binge, Congress 
defunded the Agency for several days. 
In fact, it refused formally to reauthor-
ize the Commission for some 14 years 
after 
that. 
Thankfully, 
the 
FTC 
changed approach by reining in its 
rulemaking initiatives. Congress, how-
ever, did not learn its lesson and has 
continued to grant the FTC broad pow-
ers over the years. These grants of 
power and the lack of congressional 
will have helped put the FTC on a tra-
jectory that looks eerily similar to its 
‘‘National Nanny’’ era. 
Under the leadership of Lina Khan, 
the FTC has only accelerated into this 
trajectory and is now being trans-
formed into a bigger and more invasive 
national nanny than ever could have 
been imagined in the 1970s. Her vision 
is to transform what is an enforcement 
Agency into a broader, largely inde-
pendent regulatory Agency. This move 
would reduce the congressional over-
sight of key economic regulation and 
would also have serious negative impli-
cations for countless businesses across 
the Nation that could find themselves 
subject to the whims of an unelected, 
arbitrary, 
capricious, 
out-of-control 
Agency. The FTC is on course to take 
significant new powers so that it can 
use its already broad authorities under 
section 5 of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act and elsewhere to regulate 
huge swaths of the American economy. 
We, accordingly, need to be very 
careful when considering nominees to 
the Commission. 
As a member of the Senate Com-
merce Committee, I took seriously my 
consideration of Mr. Bedoya’s nomina-
tion and spoke with him on multiple 
occasions regarding his nomination 
and regarding his vision for the Federal 
Trade Commission. During his nomina-
tion hearing, I took careful note of my 
questions to Mr. Bedoya and to his re-
sponses to ascertain his vision for the 
Commission and his view on the scope 
of the FTC’s power. His answers did lit-
tle to calm my concerns. In fact, they 
did much to add to my worries, not 
only about his nomination but about 
the future of the Commission at large. 
During my questioning, Mr. Bedoya 
signaled that he would use section 5 of 
the Federal Trade Commission Act to 
conduct unfair methods of competition 
rulemaking. That, of course, would be 
a dangerous expansion of the FTC’s 
rulemaking power, one that would 
occur without a congressional grant of 
authority. 
He refused to share his views on the 
FTC’s repeal of its vertical merger 
guidelines. 
He didn’t answer when I asked about 
his views on Lina Khan’s use of zombie 
votes, or proxy votes, of ex-commis-
sioners after they had left the Commis-
sion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2142 
April 26, 2022 
He would not provide a clear answer 
on whether he supported Lina Khan’s 
decision to remove key procedural re-
quirements attached to FTC rule-
making—the very statutory, proce-
dural requirements that were insti-
tuted in direct response to the Agen-
cy’s flagrant abuses of its own power in 
the 1970s. 
And he openly supports Lina Khan’s 
decision to close out the voice of mi-
nority commissioners to approve inves-
tigations—an action that has destroyed 
a bipartisan hallmark of the Commis-
sion. 
Mr. Bedoya did not earn my con-
fidence in his hearing. His nomination 
is not designed to strengthen American 
business or bolster our economy. In-
stead, his nomination will give the 
Commission the majority it needs to 
take American economic regulation 
out of the hands of elected lawmakers. 
We have to remember that the very 
first clause of the very first section of 
the very first article of the Constitu-
tion says that all legislative powers 
herein granted shall be vested in the 
Congress of the United States, which 
shall consist of a Senate and a House of 
Representatives. In other words, all 
Federal lawmaking power—legislative 
powers 
or 
lawmaking 
powers—the 
power to make Federal law as articu-
lated in article I, section I, clause 1—is 
vested in Congress, not in an outside 
Agency. 
Article I, section VII puts even more 
clarity on it in explaining that, in 
order to pass a Federal law, you have 
got to have passage by the Senate and 
passage by the House of the same piece 
of legislation, followed by presentment 
to the President, resulting in signa-
ture, veto, or acquiescence. Without 
that, you cannot make a Federal law. 
When we pretend to make Federal 
lawmakers outside of Congress, we 
have got to be very careful because this 
is subversive of the entire purpose of 
the Constitution, putting in the most 
dangerous power—the power to make 
prescriptive laws, the power to make 
laws adding to, altering, materially 
changing the obligations of members of 
the public. You have got to go through 
the branch of government that is most 
accountable to the people at the most 
regular intervals. 
That is why this is so concerning 
that you have in Mr. Bedoya, like you 
have in Lina Khan, someone who 
doesn’t fear this type of unaccountable, 
de facto lawmaking, not only outside 
of what the Constitution can coun-
tenance fairly but also outside of basic 
standards of accountability and good 
government. 
For all of these reasons, I fear that 
Mr. Bedoya will not only enable but 
will support the blatant attempts made 
by Lina Khan to return the FTC to its 
status as the ‘‘National Nanny’’ and, 
ultimately, the national enemy. 
Under her leadership, the FTC has 
shown disregard for the input of minor-
ity commissioners and has been frus-
trated by the legal limits surrounding 
the FTC’s authority. Lina Khan is not 
afraid to lead the Agency on a path 
that ignores legal, constitutional, and 
procedural roadblocks in its way. 
I am committed to reversing the dan-
gerous trajectory of the FTC; to mak-
ing sure that we don’t return to the 
1970s era of the FTC’s being the nanny 
of the nanny state; and to making sure 
that we restore the FTC’s account-
ability to Congress and, ultimately, to 
the people. 
We have to remember that true ac-
countability in our system of govern-
ment—accountability related to what 
the law is and how the law is written— 
always has to be with Congress. That is 
why article I is written the way that it 
is. It is why this is something that has 
to be understood appropriately as a 
nondelegable duty—that is, the power 
to make law. 
We have got to restore that account-
ability, and I fear that Mr. Bedoya will 
only further enable the radical take-
over of the Federal Trade Commission. 
I, therefore, cannot and will not sup-
port his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF LAEL BRAINARD 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, as 
America faces rising prices caused by 
corporate greed in a global pandemic 
and Putin’s war, having a full Fed 
Board has never been more vital. 
Today, we take the first step. 
Dr. Brainard is a highly qualified 
economist with decades of experience. 
She served as a member of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve since 
2014. She championed efforts to mod-
ernize and strengthen the Community 
Reinvestment Act. She is committed to 
addressing and staying ahead of finan-
cial risks to our economy. She has a 
long history of bipartisan support and 
collaboration. She served in adminis-
trations of both parties. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
nomination 
and 
to 
vote 
for 
Lael 
Brainard to the Federal Reserve. 
VOTE ON BRAINARD NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Brainard nomination? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2143 
April 26, 2022 
Senate proceed to executive session to 
consider the following two nomina-
tions: Calendar No. 807, Jerome H. 
Powell, and Calendar No. 809, Philip 
Nathan Jefferson; that there be 60 min-
utes for debate, equally divided in the 
usual form, on each nomination; that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate proceed to vote without in-
tervening action or debate on the 
nominations in the order listed; that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate; that 
no further motions be in order; that 
any related statements be printed in 
the Record; that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion; and that the Senate then resume 
legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I want to be 
clear about what this unanimous con-
sent request is about and what it at-
tempts to do. It is an attempt not to 
vote, to not have the vote on Lisa 
Cook, the nominee. I have to say it is 
a reminder of how short memories are 
around here. 
The irony of this situation we find 
ourselves in is that the vacancy on the 
Federal Reserve Board is only a va-
cancy because, when Republicans had 
COVID absences, our Democratic col-
leagues would not extend the courtesy 
of rescheduling the vote to confirm 
Judy Shelton. Instead, the vote failed, 
and she was not confirmed. Then, lo 
and behold, we have this vacancy that 
has been proposed to be filled by Lisa 
Cook. 
I should also point out how persist-
ently we tried in good faith and on 
multiple occasions to process Fed noms 
throughout this entire year. We could 
have confirmed Chairman Powell in 
January. We could have processed four 
out of five of the Fed noms in the 
Banking Committee very quickly, in-
cluding Ms. Cook, but our Democratic 
colleagues refused to allow us to proc-
ess those four out of five because we 
did not want to process Sarah Raskin. 
Now, Ms. Raskin ended up having to 
withdraw because there was bipartisan 
opposition to the radical views that she 
had espoused that the regulatory appa-
ratus of the Fed ought to be used to al-
locate capital throughout our econ-
omy. Fortunately, there was bipartisan 
opposition to this idea. 
Now it appears—and I guess it is the 
logic of my colleagues—that we can 
proceed as long as we are confirming 
everyone but Chairman Powell first. I 
don’t understand why that has to be, 
but they filed cloture before the Easter 
break, on Professor Cook, and now 
they find themselves in this awkward 
position. 
Here is what it boils down to. It is 
very simple. I want to vote on all of 
the noms. Republicans are ready to 
vote on all of the noms. Our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
have 
complained 
about not having votes. We want to 
vote. We want to vote on Lisa Cook. 
We want to vote on Chairman Powell. 
We want to vote on Mr. Jefferson. 
We are ready to vote, not to cancel a 
vote, so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 3 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I un-
derstand that the objection holds—that 
the ranking member of the Senate’s 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee is essentially saying he is 
not willing to vote on all three of 
these—two of them right now, the 
other one a bit later. I mean, it could 
be right now. Again, we have tried to 
move on these nominations. 
My 
friend 
from 
Pennsylvania 
launched a boycott of a committee 
that I have never seen or a boycott 
which actually, because of the 50–50 
Senate, stopped us—literally stopped 
us—from holding a vote. He knows 
that, and he knows they have done ev-
erything they can to stop Lisa Cook’s 
nomination—everything. 
I would point out also that it is not 
exactly an accurate version of history. 
Judy Shelton, whom my colleague 
mentioned, would have gone down if 
everybody had been there. He forgets 
that part. It wasn’t just one Repub-
lican Member who was sick; it was an-
other Republican Member who was 
going to vote no, and he understood the 
array of people in both parties who 
were opposed to Ms. Shelton. 
In understanding that, my colleague 
is saying let’s not vote on any of the 
three of them—on either the two of 
them today and then Lisa Cook later. I 
understand the rules of the Senate, and 
that is the way it will be.

CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the nomi-
nation of Executive Calendar No. 844, Lisa 
DeNell Cook, of Michigan, to be a Member of

serve System for the unexpired term of four-
teen years from February 1, 2010.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-

Senate that debate on the nomination 
of Lisa DeNell Cook, of Michigan, to be 
a Member of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System for the un-
expired term of fourteen years from 
February 1, 2010, shall be brought to a

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate re-
sume consideration of Executive Cal-
endar No. 800. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—ORDER OF 
PROCEDURE 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, the 
chairman of the Banking Committee 
spoke before this vote and made the 
point that he wants to have a vote on 
all three Fed noms. I want to have a 
vote on all of the three Fed noms who 
have been under consideration and in 
the exchanges today. Republicans want 
to vote on all three. 
We just voted on one of the three our 
Democratic colleagues had filed clo-
ture on. The cloture ripened—it came 
due—and we had the vote. So the obvi-
ous thing to do here is to set up votes 
on the other two. The other two are 
Chairman Powell, who is currently the 
Chairman and has been nominated by 
President Biden to another term as 
Chairman, and Philip Jefferson, who 
has also been nominated by President 
Biden. I think he would be the second 
African-American man in, maybe, the 
history of the Fed. I am not positive of 
that, but I think so. 
It makes a lot of sense to go with 
both of them because there is over-
whelming support for them. In fact, in 
the committee, Chairman Powell, I 
think, was reported out successfully. I 
think there was only one vote in oppo-
sition to Chairman Powell. He was 
overwhelmingly supported in the com-
mittee, and I think, very likely, over-
whelmingly would be supported on the 
floor. Mr. Jefferson was unanimously 
reported out of the committee. In other 
words, every single Republican and 
Democrat on the Banking Committee 
supported Philip Jefferson, and I am 
pretty sure still does, as I do. 
My point is, I think we ought to go 
ahead and set up the votes. We don’t 
have to have the votes right this 
minute, but we should set them up, and 
we should do it soon. So I have a unani-
mous consent request which is iden-
tical to the unanimous consent request 
that was just proposed by our chairman 
but for the reference to Lisa Cook. 
Since we just had that vote, obviously, 
it doesn’t make sense to include her in 
the unanimous consent request. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader, following con-
sultation with the Republican leader, 
prior to April 29, 2022, the Senate pro-
ceed to executive session to consider 
the following nominations: Calendar 
No. 807, Jerome H. Powell, and Cal-
endar No. 809, Philip Nathan Jefferson; 
that there be 60 minutes for debate, 
equally divided in the usual form, on 
each nomination; that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the Senate pro-
ceed to vote, without intervening ac-
tion or debate, on the nominations in 
the order listed; that the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order; that any related state-
ments be printed in the RECORD; that 
the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action; and that the 
Senate then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I reserve 
the right to object. 
I 
was 
going 
to 
say 
it 
is 
dis-
appointing—I guess ‘‘appalling’’ would 
be the better word—but it is not at all 
surprising because I have watched my 
colleagues do everything they can to 
slow and delay, even boycott actual 
votes en bloc. I have watched what 
they have done to these nominees and 
watched them continue to play politics 
with our economy. 
They have been AWOL on the fight 
against inflation for months. They talk 
about it a whole lot, but they don’t 
really have solutions. Yet they haven’t 
abandoned their tax cuts for the cor-
porations that are raising people’s 
prices, as the Presiding Officer knows 
and has spoken passionately about the 
companies that are making more and 
more and more money all the time— 
the biggest profits in American his-
tory. These companies continue to 
raise prices because they can; but my 
colleagues, when they have had oppor-
tunities 
to 
get 
talented, 
qualified 
women on the job to fight inflation at 
the Fed, they have blocked them. 
Today, about an hour and a half, 2 
hours ago, we offered to vote, right 
now, to get Chair Powell and Dr. Philip 
Jefferson on the Fed Board imme-
diately, and part of that motion was to 
delay the vote on Dr. Lisa Cook until 
all of our Members are here and 
healthy. 
My colleague on the Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee un-
derstands that a number of Senate 
Democrats 
were 
sick 
today 
and 
couldn’t come and vote. So we just said 
in our motion: Yes, let’s go ahead and 
vote on Chair Powell—I am going to 
vote for him—and let’s go ahead and 
vote on Dr. Jefferson. I am going to 
vote for him, too, and virtually all of 
my colleagues are, but let’s just hold 
off on Dr. Cook because it is a close 
vote. 
Every single Republican is voting 
against a very qualified and the first 
African-American woman to be on the 
Federal Reserve in its 109-year-old his-
tory, but Senator TOOMEY objected to 
those two votes and with the request to 
just delay Dr. Cook for a time until 
Members could come back. He would 
rather play politics. He continues to 
denigrate this distinguished nominee— 
again, the first Black woman to ever be 
nominated to the Fed. For some rea-
son, the Republican members of my 
committee take great joy in trying to 
embarrass this nominee by saying she 
is not qualified. 
Not qualified? Spelman College. 
Not qualified? A Marshall Scholar. 
Not qualified? A Truman Scholar. 
Not qualified? Studied at Oxford. 
Not qualified? Has a Ph.D. from 
Berkeley. 
These are all some of the greatest 
schools in the country. 
Not 
qualified? 
An 
economist 
at 
Michigan State University—one of the 
great State institutions in my part of 
the country. That is not qualified? Dr. 
Cook is a leading economist, with 
years of research and international ex-
perience in monetary policy on bank-
ing and financial crises. 
Maybe this is what my colleagues 
don’t like: She has seen how economic 
policy affects all kinds of different peo-
ple in different parts of the country— 
from the rural South, where she grew 
up, to the industrial Midwest, where 
she built a career. These are two parts 
of the country that have been particu-
larly affected in a negative way by 
globalization. 
Again, she is a Spelman College 
alumna, a Marshall Scholar, a Truman 
Scholar; studied at Oxford; has a Ph.D. 
from Berkeley; is a tenured professor 
for economics and international rela-
tions in the State just north of me—in 
East Lansing, MI, at Michigan State 
University. 
Yet, despite this extensive experience 
and her broad support, a small but ex-
cruciatingly loud—if I could use that 
adverb—minority, 
far 
outside 
the 
mainstream, has engaged in a smear 
campaign against Dr. Cook, the same 
sorts of attacks that Black Americans 
and women have faced for far too long. 
I won’t recite the litany of votes in 
my committee against very qualified 
women and very qualified African- 
American women. Senate Republicans 
buy into these attacks and in some 
cases are making these attacks. 
These naysayers absurdly claim that 
Lisa Cook doesn’t meet the standards 
for this position, standards that seem 
to apply only to certain nominees who 
happen to be women, particularly 
Black women. 
It is sort of a game of Whac-A-Mole. 
Each time these assertions and these 
allegations are rebutted, a new, more 
untethered one seems to arise. 
Dr. Cook would be—and I would as-
sert. I don’t just assert. I am certain 
she will be the first Black woman on 
the Federal Reserve in its more than 
100-year history. 
Think about that. This is a country 
that in my State—the ranking mem-
ber’s State—10 to 15 percent are Afri-
can Americans. In this country, about 
12 or 13 percent are Black. The Federal 
Reserve is made up of seven people. In 
1913, it was founded. In 109 years, there 
has never been a Black woman. We 
have a chance to put an outstanding, 
very qualified Black woman on, and for 
some reason, they say no. 
We are going to confirm her once our 
Members are healthy. There are a cou-
ple of Members who missed it. I believe 
it is two because of COVID. They are

going to come back, and we are going 
to confirm her. But for some reason, 
the ranking member of the committee 
would like to just embarrass Dr. Cook 
a little bit more. 
First, they make all these unwar-
ranted attacks. Then they block her in 
committee. 
Then 
they—well, 
they 
called a boycott to stop any committee 
action 
on 
another 
very 
qualified 
woman. And I might add, parentheti-
cally, because the oil industry didn’t 
like her. 
One of the things I particularly like 
about Dr. Cook is she understands—and 
maybe this is the objection. They want 
a Federal Reserve that is more sort of 
corporate-dominated, 
corporate-ori-
ented instead of putting workers at the 
center of our economy. 
I know Senator MERKLEY has been 
one of the leaders here, always under-
standing that workers should be the 
center of this economy. That is what 
Dr. Cook will do in the Federal Re-
serve. 
She 
understands 
the 
smalltown 
South. She understands the industrial 
Midwest. She has worked on the west 
coast. She has worked all over this 
country. She is international in the 
way she looks at things. But, fun-
damentally, she comes down to ordi-
nary, middle-class people and those 
who aspire to the middle class. 
She is ready to get to work to pro-
tect Americans from rising prices. We 
need her. We need all of President 
Biden’s nominees on the job right now. 
But, again, Senate Republicans could 
have earlier said yes—he didn’t have to 
object—yes, we will go forward with 
Powell; we will go forward with Jeffer-
son, but we want to embarrass Dr. 
Cook first. We want to show that we 
have the political muscle to defeat a 
really, 
really, 
really 
accomplished 
Black woman first. 
That is what they decided, that scor-
ing political points is more important 
than serving the public and bringing 
down prices. 
So today, once again, a qualified 
Black woman is going to have to wait. 
A qualified Black woman is going to 
have to wait and wait and wait. We are 
going to confirm her, but she is going 
to have to wait a little bit longer until 
the two Members of the Senate who are 
sick can return. 
The American people are going to 
have to wait, all because Senate Re-
publicans have decided their political 
gamesmanship is more important than 
the constituents they are supposed to 
serve. 
I, one last time, say: Make no mis-
take, we will confirm all of these Fed-
eral Reserve nominees. We could do it 
a lot faster if my colleagues wanted to 
cooperate. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I have 
to say it is sad and shameful to hear 
the chairman suggest, which he has 
done repeatedly now, including on the 
Senate floor, that there is some kind of 
racial bias against Black women that 
is a motivation for Republicans. 
I would like to point out, for the 
record, the fact that on the Senate 
Banking Committee, every single Re-
publican Senator has voted in favor of 
confirming five different Black women 
to different posts in just this Congress, 
President Biden’s nominees who are 
Black women, and they include Cecilia 
Rouse, 
Nuria 
Fernandez, 
Adrianne 
Todman, Alexia Latortue, and Alanna 
McCargo. And yet we hear this prepos-
terous notion that somehow the race of 
the candidate is what is going on here. 
The fact is, we have a difference of 
opinion about what qualifies a person 
to serve on the Fed. And it is not some 
tiny, obscure minority that is con-
cerned about Lisa Cook’s qualifications 
to be fighting inflation when she re-
fused to articulate any plan for dealing 
with inflation; it was the majority of 
the Senate who just voted. We just had 
the vote. 
I should also point out that what is 
the difference here? The difference is, 
we want to vote, and you just heard the 
chairman block a vote on President 
Biden’s nominee to Chair the Fed, Je-
rome Powell, and Professor Philip Jef-
ferson. The chairman doesn’t want 
votes on either of them, apparently, 
and certainly not on both of them; he 
just objected. 
I would remind everyone that for 
months now, we have been trying to 
process the Fed nominees, and our 
Democratic colleagues refused. What 
we said was, there are five nominees. 
Only one of them we are going to ob-
ject to processing. The reason was be-
cause of her radical views about using 
the supervisory powers of the Fed to 
allocate capital throughout the econ-
omy. That was a pretty radical idea. 
And guess what? The majority of the 
Senate agreed with us, and so she with-
drew her candidacy. 
We had offered for months now to 
process the other four. Earlier today, 
we were willing to do all three, but I 
think the record should show our 
Democratic colleagues refuse to allow 
us to have a vote today or tomorrow or 
this week—that is what we asked for; 
we used the exact same language the 
chairman had used earlier—on the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve and 
Professor Philip Jefferson. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, just to 
be clear, we did offer just an hour, 
maybe 2 hours ago—the ranking mem-
ber and I have spoken for maybe 20 
minutes, more or less. 
Just to be clear, we offered in that 
unanimous consent request that we 
vote on both Chair Powell and Dr. Jef-
ferson and simply delay the vote on Dr. 
Cook because several Members who 
wanted to vote for her were not here. 
Instead, the ranking member decided 
he wanted to just, one more time, try 
to embarrass Dr. Cook. It is not really 
going to work because we are going to 
confirm her. But just to be clear, my 
motion, only 2 hours ago, was let’s 
move forward on those two. That was 
rejected by Senator TOOMEY. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO BJ WESTLUND 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, a lit-
tle over 10 years ago, BJ Westlund 
made his way from Bend, OR, here to 
our Nation’s Capital to serve his fellow 
Oregonians as a correspondence assist-
ant in my office. 
Over the last decade, BJ moved up 
the ranks to legislative correspondent 
and legislative aide and then had the 
opportunity to move back to Oregon, 
move back to Bend, as my field rep-
resentative. 
He has done an incredible job in that 
capacity, but he is now, after a number 
of years in that key role, ready to start 
a new chapter in his career. 
I know that I speak for everyone on 
my team, whether in Washington, DC, 
or in Oregon, when I say that we are 
thrilled to see BJ continue to grow and 
thrive in his career, but we are also 
very saddened to see him go. 
Ask anyone on the team, past or 
present, about BJ, and there are a cou-
ple of things that might jump to mind: 
his signature sense of style for one. He 
loves to wear a good vest. Whether here 
in DC or in Oregon, it is hard for any-
one to picture BJ without a good vest. 
And wherever BJ is, you can bet there 
is a tasty cold mix of iced tea and lem-
onade not far away. 
And BJ has taken on the role of over-
seeing the Team Merkley candy desk 
while he was here in Washington, DC, 
making sure it was always stashed 
with really good candy. 
Before we changed offices in Hart, 
the legislative team was split between 
two floors. BJ was upstairs working on 
environmental and energy issues and 
referred to that area as ‘‘Eastern Or-
egon.’’ But without fail, you could find 
a steady stream of folks going up the 
staircase to stop by BJ’s desk and grab 
a piece of candy and chat. It was our 
version of the office water cooler and a 
way for BJ to help build a sense of 
community between all the team mem-
bers. 
That is the fourth thing that comes 
to mind when people think about BJ, is 
his sense of community, his welcoming 
presence, his ability to connect. It is 
what made him such an effective legis-
lative staffer, working with groups on 
their priorities, advocating for critical 
appropriations funding. And for the

last 4 years, it is what made him such 
an incredible representative for our of-
fice throughout Central Oregon. 
When asked to share her thoughts 
about BJ, one of our former team mem-
bers who worked very closely with him 
over many years had this to say: 
BJ is the calm in the storm. He is a steady, 
intelligent, caring, supportive teammate 
who cares beyond measure for his constitu-
ents. He has worked tirelessly to solve prob-
lems and bring Oregon tax dollars home to 
Central Oregon. 
She continued: 
Moving to his home office during COVID 
while continuing to be responsive to both 
teammates and constituents was a smooth 
transition because BJ handles challenges 
with aplomb. 
And she closed by saying: 
He is a treasure and just a wonderful 
human being. 
And I couldn’t say it any better. 
BJ is the calm in the storm. BJ is a 
wonderful human being. BJ does work 
tirelessly to solve problems. 
That is why, when the Bootleg fire 
struck Oregon last year, the third larg-
est fire in our State’s history, it was 
BJ who took charge of reaching out to 
and connecting with the communities 
impacted by the devastation. And it is 
a good thing he was, because commu-
nity members, Tribal leaders, land-
owners, business owners, local electeds, 
agency leaders, relief agencies, and 
conservationists all looked to BJ to be 
there for them. 
They knew that he would reach out. 
They knew he would listen to what 
they needed. They knew that he would 
do whatever it took to be there to re-
spond to those challenges. 
BJ has been the central driver on 
many major projects. One was getting 
funding for irrigation piping projects 
to help Oregon farmers get more water, 
while simultaneously putting more 
water back in our rivers, a positive en-
vironmental effect. 
A second was helping an Oregonian 
Tribe find justice by finally repealing 
the fraudulent 1865 treaty that robbed 
them of their hunting and fishing 
rights. 
A third was almost doubling the size 
of 
the 
Cascade-Siskiyou 
National 
Monument for future generations of 
Oregonians to enjoy, a monument that 
comes at the intersection of three crit-
ical mountain ranges and has flora and 
fauna found nowhere else in the world. 
BJ is the kind of person who takes 
extra pride in drafting a customized 
letter to a student or making a one-off 
phone call to a constituent looking for 
help or advice because taking that 
small extra step can restore their faith 
and their trust in government. 
But anyone who knows BJ wouldn’t 
be surprised by any of this because 
they know how intensely he believes in 
public service. It is how he was raised. 
It is what he saw and learned growing 
up from his father, who was a good 
friend of mine, Ben Westlund, whom I 
had the privilege of serving with in the 
Oregon statehouse before he went on to 
serve as an Oregon senator and Oregon 
treasurer. 
We lost Ben about 12 years ago, be-
fore BJ came to work on my team, but 
I know how proud he would be if here 
with us today to see all the great 
things that his son has done and will 
continue to do in service to the people 
of Oregon. 
So, BJ, thank you for all you have 
done throughout your time on Team 
Merkley to help build a better world. 
The team and I wish you well as you 
begin the next chapter of your life, and 
we can’t wait to see all of the great 
things that you will continue to do and 
to achieve in the years to come. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
CORPORATE GREED 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the 
American people are increasingly out-
raged by the level of corporate greed 
that we are seeing in this country. As 
you know, while prices are rapidly in-
creasing, corporate profits are soaring: 
in the oil industry in what we pay at 
the gas pumps; in the food industry in 
what we pay in grocery stores; in hous-
ing and in so many other areas. Mean-
while, while the very, very rich get 
richer, because of inflation, many 
workers are now seeing a decline in 
their real wages. 
During this pandemic, unbelievably— 
and I hope that everybody knows this— 
while workers have been struggling, 
the billionaire class, people who are 
worth at least $1 billion, have seen a $2 
trillion increase in their wealth; and 
the level of income and wealth inequal-
ity today is the highest that it has 
been in over 100 years. 
Two 
people—Mr. 
Musk 
and 
Mr. 
Bezos—now own more wealth than the 
bottom 42 percent of American soci-
ety—over 130 million people. Two peo-
ple own more wealth than the bottom 
130 million Americans. 
In the midst of all of this—inflation, 
inequality, corporate greed—working 
people have declared loudly and clearly 
that enough is enough. We must end 
the corporate greed that is hurting so 
many of our families. Workers are now 
fighting back in a way that I have not 
seen for a very long time to improve 
their standard of living, to get the 
wages and benefits they desperately 
need, and to get a seat at the negoti-
ating table in a way that has not taken 
place in a very, very long time. 
Workers throughout this country are 
now in the process of organizing unions 
at a grassroots level and are prepared 
to go out on strike when the greed of 
large corporations prevents them from 
receiving decent wages and decent ben-
efits. During the last couple of years, I 
have personally been involved in a 
number of union-organizing campaigns 
and strikes throughout the country— 
from 
John 
Deere, 
Nabisco, 
and 
Kellogg’s in the Midwest to the War-
rior Met strike in Alabama—which 
continues today—to the Kroger grocery 
store strike in Colorado, and many oth-
ers—and I have to say that I have been 
incredibly impressed by the solidarity 
and the courage of those workers who 
are prepared to stand up for justice 
against very powerful corporate inter-
ests. 
As I am sure the Presiding Officer 
knows, a historic union victory was 
achieved nearly 1 month ago by Ama-
zon workers in Staten Island. Amazon 
is one of the most profitable and one of 
the most powerful corporations in 
America. It is also one of the largest 
employers in our country, with close to 
a million workers. 
We are talking, when we talk about 
Amazon, about a company that made a 
record-breaking $36 billion in profit 
last year—$36 billion. And that was a 
453-percent increase from where it was 
before the pandemic. In other words, 
Amazon today is doing unbelievably 
well, and, in fact, it is doing better as 
a company than it has ever done be-
fore. 
We are talking about a company that 
is owned by Mr. Jeff Bezos, the second 
wealthiest person in America, worth 
$170 billion. Let me repeat that. He is 
not the wealthiest; he is only the sec-
ond wealthiest, worth $170 billion. 
And here is something that is inter-
esting and tells you about our corrupt 
political system and our regressive and 
unfair tax system. We are talking 
about 
a 
company—Amazon—that 
makes huge profits, that paid noth-
ing—zero—in Federal income taxes in 
2017 and 2018 and paid a lower tax rate, 
Federal tax rate, than a nurse or a fire-
fighter last year, after making billions 
in profits. The average nurse, fire-
fighter, or grocery store worker has an 
effective tax rate that is higher than 
what Amazon’s was last year. 
We are also talking about Mr. Bezos 
as an individual, who, in a given year, 
despite his extraordinary wealth, has 
also paid zero—nothing—in Federal 
taxes. 
It is funny. On Sunday, I was in New 
York City, and I stopped in a McDon-
ald’s and was talking to one of the 
guys who works there. I asked him how 
much money he made. He makes $15 an 
hour. And then he came back and said: 
Well, they take out over a dollar in 
Federal taxes. So a guy working in 
McDonald’s for $15 an hour probably 
has a higher tax rate than the second 
wealthiest person in this country. 
That is what happens here in Wash-
ington when you are somebody like Mr. 
Bezos or some other billionaire and you 
make a lot of campaign contributions 
and you have an army of accountants 
and lawyers who help you avoid your 
tax responsibilities. 
Mr. President, during the pandemic 
the last several years, Mr. Bezos, like

April 26, 2022 
many other billionaires, did very, very 
well. In fact, since March of 2020, Mr. 
Bezos became $65 billion richer, in just 
a couple of years—huge increase in his 
wealth. So, Mr. President, if you ask 
me why people in this country are real-
ly, really angry, I will tell you, and 
that has a lot to do with the reality 
that, in the midst of the pandemic, in 
the midst of the massive economic dis-
location that we have seen, we have 
lost tens of thousands of essential 
workers, people who live paycheck to 
paycheck, who had no choice. They had 
to go into a warehouse. They had to go 
into a grocery store. They had to drive 
a bus. They had to do all of the things 
that keep America going; and as a re-
sult of that, having to go to work, 
thousands of them contracted COVID 
and many thousands actually died. 
That is what happens when you are an 
ordinary worker in America living pay-
check to paycheck. You don’t have a 
choice. You have got to go to work to 
feed your family. 
And during that same period, the bil-
lionaires and Mr. Bezos made out like 
bandits. Bezos himself became $65 bil-
lion richer. Jeff Bezos has enough 
money to own a $500 million yacht— 
$500 million yacht. He has enough 
money to afford a $175 million estate in 
Beverly Hills. He has enough money to 
afford a $78 million, 14-acre estate in 
Maui. He has enough money to own a 
$23 million mansion right here in 
Washington, DC, which has 25 bath-
rooms. So if you are in Washington, 
DC, and you have to go to the bath-
room, you know someplace that you 
can possibly go. Mr. Bezos has enough 
money to buy a rocket ship to blast 
William Shatner to the edge of outer 
space. 
Yet even though Mr. Bezos can afford 
all of these mansions and his $500 mil-
lion yacht and his rocket ship, Mr. 
Bezos refuses to pay his workers at 
Amazon decent wages, decent benefits, 
or provide decent working conditions. 
That, Mr. President, is what exces-
sive greed is all about, and that is why 
the American people are saying enough 
is enough. The American people want 
action from the President; they want 
action from Congress; and we have got 
to deliver. 
From the very beginning of the 
union-organizing effort until today, 
Mr. Bezos and his company have done 
everything possible—legal and illegal— 
to defeat the union effort. In fact, 
Amazon cannot even come to grips 
with the reality that workers in Staten 
Island won their union election fair 
and square. In order to stall the proc-
ess out, Amazon’s lawyers have ap-
pealed that election result to the 
NLRB. Their strategy, as is often the 
strategy of corporate interests con-
fronting unions, is to use their incred-
ible resources, their unending amount 
of money, to stall, stall, and stall. 
In every way possible, Amazon is re-
fusing to negotiate a fair first contract 
with the Amazon Labor Union. In fact, 
Amazon has been engaged in a massive 
attempt to undermine the union orga-
nizing drive in direct violation of labor 
laws and regulations. 
Let’s be clear. Amazon has already 
been penalized more than $75 million 
for breaking Federal discrimination 
and labor laws. Amazon is currently 
being sued by the National Labor Rela-
tions Board to reinstate a worker who 
was illegally fired for organizing a 
union. To date, there are currently 59— 
59—unfair labor cases against Amazon 
pending at the National Labor Rela-
tions 
Board. 
Several 
current 
and 
former employees at Amazon have al-
leged that the company has engaged in 
illegal harassment and discrimination 
based on race, gender, and sexual ori-
entation. 
Amazon misclassifies delivery drivers 
as independent contractors rather than 
employees in order to evade tax, wage, 
and benefit responsibilities. 
Amazon’s inadequate workplace safe-
ty policies also pose grave risks to 
workers. If you can believe it—and this 
really is quite unbelievable—according 
to a New York Times investigation, 
Amazon warehouses have a 150-percent 
turnover rate—150 percent a year. 
Workers come into the warehouses; 
they are worked as hard as humanly 
possible. And then after they are ex-
hausted and physically broken down, 
they leave and then a whole new set of 
workers comes in and the process con-
tinues. Further, in some locations, 
their workplace injury rates are more 
than 21⁄2 times the industry average. 
I was in Staten Island on Sunday 
talking to some Amazon workers, and 
they tell me that injuries take place 
every single day, and many of them go 
unreported. Last December, six Ama-
zon workers died after they were re-
quired to continue working during un-
safe weather conditions in a warehouse 
that did not have appropriate safety fa-
cilities or policies. 
It is abundantly clear that time and 
time again, Amazon has engaged in il-
legal anti-union activity. Amazon may 
be a large and profitable corporation, it 
may be owned by one of the wealthiest 
people in America, but it cannot be al-
lowed to continue to violate the law 
and the rights of its employees. If 
working people are asked to obey the 
law, they do it, or they get punished. 
That same principle must be upheld for 
a large and powerful corporation like 
Amazon. 
That is why this morning, I sent a 
letter to President Biden urging him to 
sign an Executive order to prohibit 
companies like Amazon that have vio-
lated labor laws from receiving Federal 
contracts paid for by the taxpayers of 
America. 
Let me quote directly from the let-
ter: 
Dear President Biden, last September, I 
was delighted to hear you State that you 
‘‘intend to be the most pro-union President 
leading the most pro-union administration 
in American history.’’ 
That is from President Biden. 
At a time of massive income and wealth in-
equality, where too many workers are falling 
behind, your sentiment [Mr. President] is ex-
actly right. We need to build the trade union 
movement in America and allow [more] 
workers to engage in collective bargaining. 
One of the most effective ways for you 
[President Biden] to begin accomplishing 
this important goal would be to ensure that 
no corporation that is engaged in illegal 
anti-union activities receives a contract paid 
for by the taxpayers of the United States. 
That would be enormously effective 
in curtailing the illegal activities of 
companies like Amazon. I then contin-
ued in saying in my letter to the Presi-
dent: 
As you will recall [Mr. President], during 
the presidential campaign you promised to 
‘‘institute a multi-year federal debarment 
for all employers who illegally oppose 
unions’’ and to ‘‘ensure federal contracts 
only go to employers who sign neutrality 
agreements committing not to run anti- 
union campaigns. 
That is what President Biden said as 
a candidate for President. 
Then I say in my letter: 
That campaign promise was exactly right. 
Today, I am asking you to fulfill that prom-
ise . . . As you may know, Amazon, one of 
the largest and most profitable corporations 
in America, is the poster child as to why this 
anti-union busting Executive Order is needed 
now more than ever. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the full text of the letter be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
APRIL 26, 2022. 
President JOSEPH R. BIDEN, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: Last September, I 
was delighted to hear you state that you ‘‘in-
tend to be the most pro-union President 
leading the most pro-union administration 
in American history.’’ 
At a time of massive income and wealth in-
equality, where too many workers are falling 
behind, your sentiment is exactly right. We 
need to build the trade union movement in 
America and allow more workers to engage 
in collective bargaining. 
One of the most effective ways for you to 
begin accomplishing this important goal 
would be to ensure that no corporation that 
is engaged in illegal anti-union activities re-
ceives a contract paid for by the taxpayers of 
the United States. 
As you will recall, during the presidential 
campaign you promised to ‘‘institute a 
multi-year federal debarment for all employ-
ers who illegally oppose unions’’ and to ‘‘en-
sure federal contracts only go to employers 
who sign neutrality agreements committing 
not to run anti-union campaigns.’’ That 
campaign promise was exactly right. Today, 
I am asking you to fulfill that promise. 
The essence of your plan for strengthening 
union organizing was to make sure that fed-
eral dollars do not flow into the hands of un-
scrupulous employers who engage in union- 
busting, participate in wage theft, or violate 
labor law. 
In order to implement that plan, I urge 
you to sign an Executive Order preventing 
companies that violate federal labor laws 
from contracting with the federal govern-
ment. 
As you may know, Amazon, one of the 
largest and most profitable corporations in 
America, is the poster child as to why this 
anti-union busting Executive Order is needed 
now more than ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2148 
April 26, 2022 
According to filings with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor (DOL), Amazon spent over $4 
million on consultants last year alone in an 
effort to prevent its warehouses from union-
izing. As part of their illegal anti-union ac-
tivity, they forced workers to attend closed- 
door anti-union meetings and discriminated 
against pro-union workers. After workers in 
Staten Island, New York voted overwhelm-
ingly to join the independent Amazon Labor 
Union, Amazon has not only refused to nego-
tiate a first contract with them but refuses 
to recognize that the union exists even 
though the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) certified their union victory. 
Amazon has been penalized more than $75 
million for breaking federal discrimination 
and wage laws and is currently being sued by 
the NLRB to reinstate a worker who was il-
legally fired for organizing a union. The 
NLRB has found multiple instances of illegal 
opposition to unions by Amazon, and there 
are currently 59 open Unfair Labor Practice 
cases pending before the NLRB. Numerous 
current and former employees have alleged 
that Amazon engaged in illegal harassment 
and discrimination based on race, gender, 
and sexual orientation. Amazon misclassifies 
delivery drivers as independent contractors 
rather than employees to evade tax, wage, 
and benefit responsibilities. Amazon’s inad-
equate workplace safety policies also pose 
grave risks to workers. In some cases, their 
workplace injury rates are more than 2.5 
times the industry average. Last December, 
six Amazon workers died after they were re-
quired to continue working during unsafe 
weather conditions in a warehouse that did 
not have appropriate safety facilities or poli-
cies. 
Mr. President: It is abundantly clear that 
time and time again Amazon has engaged in 
illegal anti-union activity. Amazon may be a 
large and profitable corporation, it may be 
owned by one of the wealthiest people in 
America, but it cannot be allowed to con-
tinue to violate the law and the rights of its 
employees. The time has come to tell Ama-
zon that if it wants another federal contract, 
it must obey the law. 
Since 2004, Amazon has received thousands 
of federal contracts worth billions of dollars. 
The Washington Post, also owned by Mr. 
Bezos, reported that Amazon is in line to re-
ceive a cloud contract from the National Se-
curity Agency worth up to $10 billion—a con-
tract that it should not receive as long as it 
continues to violate labor laws. Another 
Bezos-owned company, Blue Origin, may also 
receive a contract from NASA worth up to 
$10 billion to fly a spaceship to the moon 
after more than 20 current and former em-
ployees alleged that this company repeat-
edly discriminated against workers and did 
not adhere to safety protocols. 
Mr. President: Taxpayer dollars should not 
go to companies like Amazon and multi-bil-
lionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly 
break the law. 
And let’s be clear, it is not just Amazon 
and Blue Origin. According to the U.S. Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, federal con-
tractors were required to pay nearly $225 
million in back wages to workers for Service 
Contract Act violations between 2014 and 
2019. An investigation completed by the Sen-
ate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions found that nearly 30 percent of 
the top 200 violators of workplace safety and 
wage theft were government contractors. 
The federal government spends more than 
$600 billion each year on contracts to thou-
sands of companies who employ more than 4 
million contract workers. These workers, 
just like every worker in America, deserve 
fair pay and benefits, safe workplaces, and 
the right to a union. 
I urge you to ban companies who break 
federal labor laws from receiving federal con-
tracts. 
Sincerely, 
BERNARD SANDERS, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Biden, more than any other Presi-
dent I can recall, has talked over and 
over again about being pro-union. I ap-
preciate very much what the President 
has said, and I know him to be abso-
lutely sincere when he says it. But just 
this afternoon, in an article published 
in POLITICO, an article that dealt 
with my letter to the President, this is 
what the article said: 
A White House official said that the Presi-
dent ‘‘has stated consistently and firmly 
that every worker in every state must have 
a free and fair choice to join a union and the 
right to bargain collectively with their em-
ployer.’’ The official, who declined to be 
named, added that Biden believes ‘‘there 
should be no intimidation, no coercion, no 
threats, and no anti-union propaganda from 
employers while workers are making that vi-
tally important choice about a union.’’ 
That is a statement from a White 
House spokesman this afternoon. 
What I would say is that what this 
official 
said 
that 
President 
Biden 
doesn’t want is precisely what is hap-
pening in Amazon right now. There is 
intimidation. There is coercion. There 
are threats and anti-union propaganda. 
In fact, what President Biden says 
should not be happening is precisely 
what is happening at Amazon. 
Therefore, it is my view that the 
time for talk is over. The time for ac-
tion is now. Taxpayer dollars should 
not go to companies like Amazon and 
multibillionaires like Jeff Bezos who 
repeatedly break the law. No govern-
ment—not the Federal Government, 
not the State government, and not the 
city government—should be handing 
out corporate welfare to union busters 
and labor law violators. 
Today, I say to President Biden: You 
promised to prevent union busters like 
Amazon from receiving lucrative con-
tracts from the Federal Government. 
Keep that promise. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Orrin G. 
Hatch will be remembered for many 
things. His 42 years of service in this 
body are marked by successes; historic 
and prolific legislation; and, of course, 
statesmanship. He served longer as a 
U.S. Senator than any other in the his-
tory of the State of Utah or in the his-
tory of the Republican Party. 
At his retirement, he had passed 
more bills into law than any other leg-
islator alive, an astounding 750. While 
the record of his service is remarkable 
and memorable, I invite the Senate and 
the Nation to remember Senator Orrin 
Hatch by the things that he remem-
bered every day, here in the Senate and 
in his private life. 
Every day upon entering his Senate 
office, Orrin Hatch would look upon a 
prominently hung painting depicting 
his 
Utah 
pioneer 
grandfather 
and 
great-grandfather as they were fording 
a stream on horseback. This image, 
like so much else in his life, was a re-
minder of Senator Hatch’s pioneer leg-
acy, his ancestry, and destiny. 
In Utah, there is almost no more 
honorable title than that of pioneer. In 
the particular parlance of our State, a 
pioneer is not merely someone who 
goes where others haven’t gone before. 
No, a pioneer looks toward the future 
without forgetting who he or she is. A 
pioneer, like those who settled the Salt 
Lake Valley and much of the western 
United States, does so not out of con-
quest or in search of glory; a pioneer 
goes and works out of duty and respon-
sibility and faith. 
Orrin Hatch always remembered his 
roots. Raised the son of a mechanical 
laborer, he grew up in a family of little 
means. Orrin was one of nine children 
raised in a cramped Depression-era 
home without indoor plumbing. Two of 
Orrin’s siblings died young. Another, 
his older brother Jesse, gave the ulti-
mate sacrifice as a turret gunner flying 
over Austria mere months before the 
Allied victory in Europe. 
Orrin always remembered this exam-
ple of work and sacrifice from his par-
ents and from his brother Jesse. The 
sense of duty to God, family, and Na-
tion was the primary driver through-
out his life. 
He served a 2-year mission for the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints in Ohio. He became the first in 
his family to graduate from college, at-
tending Brigham Young University. He 
met Elaine Hansen, and the couple 
married in 1957. They later returned to 
Pittsburgh, PA, and Orrin completed 
law school at the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Law, while living in 
what had previously served as a chick-
en coop in his parents’ backyard. He 
worked as a metalworker and as a jan-
itor to provide for his family while at-
tending law school. 
Never one to make much of a fuss 
about it, Orrin Hatch just did the work 
that was expected of him, and he did it 
remarkably well. He knew that life was 
not easy and that he couldn’t expect 
handouts. He developed the reputation 
of a fighter, and while a dedicated 
friend with an inviting laugh, he would 
never forget the lessons he had learned 
young while in the amateur boxing 
ring. 
After moving back to Utah and run-
ning a successful law practice in Salt 
Lake City, Orrin ran for the Senate to 
fight for the moral fiber and everyday 
work ethic of Americans that he felt 
was not being represented adequately 
in Washington, DC. He won, and he set 
out to defend family values and con-
stitutional principles. 
He would remember to do so through-
out his career, pioneering the Hatch

Amendment, a proposed constitutional 
amendment that sought to correct the 
erroneous claim that there is a con-
stitutional right to abortion, one that 
prohibits States from protecting un-
born human life, and steadfastly advo-
cating for a balanced budget amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Orrin Hatch defended life, religious 
liberty, economic responsibility, and 
personal freedom throughout his entire 
service in the U.S. Senate. His 750 pro-
posals that became law cover every-
thing from welfare reform to regu-
latory restructuring, to laws adjusting 
the Federal judiciary, to hallmark tax 
cuts. Hatch’s tenure in the Senate was 
marked by his chairmanship of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, the Committee on 
the Judiciary, and the Finance Com-
mittee, before serving as President Pro 
Tempore. 
Senator Hatch helped rein in activist 
Federal judges and reformed the entire 
Federal judiciary, and has helped re-
store the true meaning of the Constitu-
tion as applied and interpreted by our 
courts. 
Senator Hatch played a prime role in 
the 
nomination 
of 
every 
Supreme 
Court Justice for decades. He defended 
the Court and the honor of Justices 
serving and presenting themselves with 
different judicial philosophies. 
Beyond his countless political ac-
complishments, Orrin Hatch was a 
dedicated father, grandfather, great- 
grandfather, and man of faith. He al-
ways remembered the most important 
things in life. He composed countless 
songs of praise and of patriotism. He 
served as a volunteer leader in his 
church congregations and in his com-
munities. He founded the Orrin G. 
Hatch Foundation to carry on and re-
member his work and advocacy for 
collegiality and bipartisanship after 
his retirement from the Senate. 
Orrin 
Hatch 
always 
remembered 
Utah. On weekends, you could find him 
at the grocery store, in his church con-
gregation, rubbing elbows with people 
he knew and loved. He would talk 
about the politics of the day but also 
the news affecting communities and 
families he cared for. Those who knew 
him felt the care and the interest that 
he had. 
After I had served as his Senate page, 
as a high school student, there were 
just a couple of photos on my wall as a 
teenager. One was of Karl Malone in 
his Utah Jazz jersey and another was a 
photo of me with Senator Orrin Hatch, 
one of my prized possessions. 
Later, when I was serving as a mis-
sionary along the U.S.-Mexico border, 
on the Texas side, Senator Hatch sent 
me a note, along with a $10 check, sug-
gesting that I use it to go get a good 
lunch. I cherished the note and never 
could cash the check. You see, the 
memory and the memento were worth 
so much more than the lunch it could 
buy. I still have that check. It is a 
prized possession. 
Orrin Hatch also remembered to 
work. He would come to the Senate 
early and stay late. He would think 
years ahead and persistently, methodi-
cally, pursue his plans. He would take 
the time to build coalitions behind 
ideas and bring about needed reforms. 
Senator Hatch knew that the Senate 
was designed to be the cooling saucer, 
where ideas would steep and percolate, 
often over the course of years and even 
decades. 
Yet Orrin always remembered the 
people behind the politics. He was a 
mentor and a friend to Senators from 
both sides of the aisle, and he built 
deep friendships with people of all po-
litical backgrounds. He cherished a 
friendship with Senator Ted Kennedy 
and called the late Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg a dear friend. 
He instilled his hallmark good humor 
and sense of duty on the newer Mem-
bers of the Senate. I was one of them. 
He greeted and accepted me warmly— 
mentioning only a few times over the 
years the fact that I had, decades pre-
viously, served as his Senate page. 
He was a force for collegiality and co-
operation, and while he remained dedi-
cated to the principles and people who 
brought him to the Senate, he would 
work with anyone and everyone to get 
the job done. 
Orrin Hatch was a giant of the Sen-
ate and a veritable pillar in Utah. His 
influence, his hearty laugh, and power-
ful advice are missed by us here in the 
Senate and by millions in Utah. I know 
I speak for the entire Senate in sending 
our deepest condolences and warmest 
appreciation to Elaine and to their 
children—Brent, Marcia, Scott, Kim-
berly, Alysa, and Jess, as well as their 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
The gift of Senator Hatch’s life of 
service has made our State and our Na-
tion better. 
As I said, there is perhaps no more 
noble title in Utah than that of pio-
neer. Orrin Hatch was a pioneer, 
through and through—not just the de-
scendant of pioneers but a pioneer in 
his own right. He followed in the foot-
steps of his forebearers, and he left a 
legacy of dedication, of service, and of 
truth. 
I commend his memory to the his-
tory of our Republic, in the words of a 
beloved hymn fittingly entitled ‘‘They 
the Builders of the Nation.’’ Here is 
how it goes: 
They, the builders of the nation, 
Blazing trails along the way; 
Stepping-stones for generations 
Were their deeds of every day. 
Building new and firm foundations, 
Pushing on the wild frontier, 
Forging onward, ever onward, 
Blessed, honored Pioneer! 
I bid my friend Senator Orrin Hatch 
onward, ever onward. May we as a na-
tion forever remember his legacy is my 
prayer. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The Senator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
from the second that they wake up in 
the morning to the moment they put 
their heads on the pillow at night, the 
American people are burning through 
cash. And, as I have spent the last 2 
weeks talking with Tennesseans, talk-
ing with people in the real world, this 
is a sentiment that they continue to 
talk about. 
Now, they know inflation is real. It 
wasn’t temporary. It wasn’t something 
that was just a problem for the rich. It 
is a problem that hits every single indi-
vidual, and the spin that is coming out 
of the White House really is not reso-
nating with hard-working taxpayers 
anymore. 
When I am out and about in Ten-
nessee, people are talking about infla-
tion, the border, and the sense of de-
spair that they see taking over their 
communities. And they cannot get over 
the lengths to which this White House 
and this administration have gone to 
try to convince them that everything 
is OK, you don’t have anything to 
worry about, and things are better 
than they have ever been. 
They can’t believe it. They can’t be-
lieve that this administration is living 
in the land of denial, because they 
know that this message doesn’t add up 
with the reality of their lives, and they 
have spent 16 months digging them-
selves out from under massive gas and 
grocery bills. Every time they fill up 
the tank or they fill up the grocery 
cart, they know that it is probably 
more than 8 percent inflation. Every 
time they go to the hardware store, 
they see it. When they are buying a 
gallon of paint or fertilizer for their 
garden, they see it. And the few discre-
tionary dollars they used to allow 
themselves for some new clothes or the 
occasional food delivery now go to es-
sentials, and, even then, they still are 
making tough choices. As I said, from 
the second they wake up in the morn-
ing to the moment their heads hit the 
pillow at night, the American people 
are burning through cash almost as 
fast as Joe Biden and the Democrats 
are burning through our taxpayer dol-
lars. 
The Biden administration might not 
take this seriously. They may say: We 
will just go print more money. 
Look at the amount of debt they 
have run up. Tennesseans do take this 
issue seriously, and at this point, they 
laugh at the alternate reality coming 
from DC, and they know that the 
‘‘Putin price hike’’ is something that is 
so divorced from reality. 
It wasn’t enough for Joe Biden to 
abandon his responsibilities. He had to 
take the extra step of exploiting the 
more than 2,500 innocent civilians 
Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
murdered 
in 
Ukraine. It is just disgusting. But that 
is the Democrats’ playbook—isn’t it?— 
never let a crisis go to waste; pick up 
words that you can use in your spin. 
If the White House had stopped to 
think about what American taxpayers 
do when they are broke, when they 
have gotten to the end of their money 
before they get to the end of their 
month, when they have debt rolling

over them, then the White House might 
have realized that now is not the time 
to spend more money on programs that 
the taxpayers do not want. 
Now, every Tennessean who has good 
common sense—we have got hundreds 
of thousands of them—they know that 
nobody would commit to a self-destruc-
tive agenda just because they thought 
they could force somebody else to go 
pick up the tab and pay for it. 
It doesn’t make sense, but that is 
what this administration is doing, and 
I think this is one of those things that, 
in their playbook, they think sounds 
great. But with the American people, 
this is going to backfire. 
And through all of this, the President 
has shown the people who he is and 
what priorities really matter to him. 
Instead of exercising some much need-
ed self-control, he decided to beg for 
the Green New Deal, wasteful social 
spending, and an election takeover. His 
allies in Congress have even come back 
to Washington ready to make a deal 
with the devil to resurrect his ‘‘Build 
Back Broke’’ agenda. 
In the interest of bipartisanship, I 
would like to offer some thoughts to 
my Democratic colleagues. Next time 
that you go home, go over to the gro-
cery store and ask a busy mom who is 
holding a shopping list in one hand and 
digital coupons on her phone in the 
other just how they are managing 
through this inflation crisis. 
Ask them: Do you think it is stuck at 
8 percent inflation? Do you think it is 
closer to 15 percent inflation? 
Then, follow their advice, because I 
can guarantee you that they will 
choose to give you an earful. They are 
about fed up. 
There are thousands of moms and 
grandmoms who know what they are 
doing, and, more importantly, they 
know how they are going to spend 
every single penny that they have 
itemized in their budget for groceries, 
for gas, for the summer garden. They 
know how they are going to spend that 
money. 
They wish Washington would be as 
careful with taxpayer money as they 
are being with their hard-earned dol-
lars. 
It really makes them shake their 
heads when they hear that the care-
takers of the most powerful Nation in 
the world have no vision for the future 
and no plan for how to get us to a vi-
sion. 
All that this administration and the 
White House and the Democrats—who, 
by the way, are in charge of all the 
government here in Washington, DC— 
all they have is an agenda. They have 
got a to-do list. They are wanting to 
check the boxes, and that agenda is 
heavy on spending and light on every-
thing else that matters to the Amer-
ican people. 
And, by the way, all that heavy 
spending is not Federal Government 
money, mind you. It is money that is 
coming out of the pockets of hard- 
working taxpayers—every penny of it. 
We know border security isn’t on the 
Biden administration’s list of prior-
ities. It is not on the to-do list. It is 
not on the thinking-about-it list. 
In the alternate reality that this 
White House is operating in, the only 
immigration policy that matters is 
guaranteeing an open border—the soon-
er they can get it, the better. They are 
all about it. We all know how well that 
policy has worked out so far. 
On behalf of a lot of Tennesseans 
back home, I would like to inject a lit-
tle reality into this conversation also. 
Since day one of this administration, 
Joe Biden has done everything in his 
power to sabotage the Border Patrol 
and local law enforcement officials. His 
open borders rhetoric invited massive 
caravans of migrants to overwhelm the 
border. And just when we thought 
things couldn’t get worse, he turned 
his back on President Trump’s success-
ful ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ program. As a 
result, last month, encounters along 
our southern border were up 33 percent. 
That is right—up 33 percent in 1 
month. 
CBP regularly seizes millions of dol-
lars’ worth of meth, fentanyl, and her-
oin that would have otherwise landed 
in ‘‘Small Town, USA.’’ And, now, 
President Biden wants to abandon title 
42, which is the last best defense we 
have against this wave of illegal immi-
gration. We already know that if he 
goes through with this, he will lose 
control of the border to the cartels. 
The Border Patrol estimates that 
18,000 people a day will try to make it 
across the border. Now, currently, 
there are 6,000 people a day. Those are 
record numbers. Think of what is going 
to happen if 18,000 people a day are 
rushing our southern border. 
Now, let me give you a little perspec-
tive on this. Tennessee has 345 towns 
and cities. So we checked to see how 
many of these towns and cities are 
18,000 people or less. Well, 90 percent of 
the towns and cities in the State of 
Tennessee are 18,000 people—18,000 resi-
dents or fewer than that. 
Now, think about that. It is like a 
Tennessee town—that number of people 
coming across the border every day. 
I would think that, you know, that it 
is the same thing, Mr. President, in 
Michigan. I don’t know the number of 
towns and cities you have, but I would 
imagine that the majority of those are 
there also, 18,000 or fewer residents. 
Think about this impact. How many 
days can you do that? How many 
weeks? How many years before you 
completely disrupt what is going on in 
your towns, in your State? 
I have to ask you: What is so compas-
sionate about subjecting 18,000 people a 
day—18,000—to the risk of exploitation 
by a drug cartel? And what is so com-
passionate about standing by while 
18,000 people a day risk death by expo-
sure in the desert? Is sticking to your 
talking points worth the lives of Na-
tional Guardsmen like Bishop Evans, 
who drowned last week while trying to 
rescue 
migrants 
crossing 
the 
Rio 
Grande River? 
The decision to abandon title 42 is 
dangerous, and, frankly, anyone who 
supports it should be ashamed of them-
selves. 
Last month, I joined several of my 
colleagues on a letter to Chairman 
DURBIN, asking him to allow the Judi-
ciary Committee to get some answers 
about how the administration plans to 
deal with this. The committee must 
use its oversight authority to summon 
Secretary Mayorkas for a hearing so he 
can explain his plan to prevent chaos 
on the border. 
If that plan exists, we don’t know 
about it. But, certainly, tripling the 
number of people per day at the south-
ern border is going to create a chaotic 
situation. 
I want to make it clear that this use 
of our oversight authority is the bare 
minimum, and, as of now, Chairman 
DURBIN has not indicated that he is 
willing to meet this very minimum 
bar. 
We must not allow the administra-
tion to hide behind their title 42 talk-
ing points. The American people won’t 
stand for it because they know that 
until Joe Biden secures the border, 
until he puts back in place the ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ policy, until he keeps 
title 42, every town will be a border 
town and every State will be a border 
State. 
When I am in Tennessee and talking 
with Tennesseans, what we know is 
that they are like a lot of people all 
across this country. They don’t trust 
their government to have their inter-
ests at heart. They don’t take the ac-
tions of their government seriously be-
cause in the Democratic-controlled 
government—all branches here in DC— 
they don’t seem to take their jobs seri-
ously. They are certainly not looking 
out for the American people. They are 
not taking actions that are going to re-
duce the cost of a gallon of gas at the 
pump or the cost of food at the grocery 
store or the cost of paint, the cost of 
fertilizer, the cost of tools—the list 
goes on and on. 
But what they do believe is that it is 
time for this administration to make 
inflation, to make border security, to 
make the sovereignty of this Nation a 
priority and to begin to build a vision 
for this Nation, not just a to-do list.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, while 
returning with Senate colleagues from 
a delegation trip to Europe to further 
strengthen the trans-Atlantic alliance 
in the context of Vladimir Putin’s war 
against the Ukrainian people, our 
plane was grounded by mechanical fail-

REMEMBERING DR. JON WEFALD 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to memorialize and honor 
one of my great friends and mentor, 
our former Kansas State University 
President Dr. Jon Wefald who passed 
away on April 16 after a long and illus-
trious life serving higher education and 
the State of Kansas. His work at K- 
State brought the university to great 
heights, and his realized dreams will 
live on forever in K-State lore. 
My wife and I first met Dr. Wefald at 
a student recruitment dinner in Great 
Bend we were cohosting, where his en-
ergy was contagious and palpable. He 
was a young university president with 
a vision and a purpose we all wanted to 
be part of. He made every student in 
the room know they were each impor-
tant, and K-State would help them re-
alize 
their 
dreams. 
We 
remained 
friends up until the time of his passing 
with regular communications and ad-
vice. I will miss him. 
Dr. Wefald served as K-State’s 12th 
president from 1986 to 2009 and is cred-
ited with growing the university into a 
top 10 land-grant university. During 
his 23 years of leadership, the univer-
sity added 2.2 million square feet of 
new buildings. He also helped philan-
thropy increase from $6 million a year 
to nearly $100 million annually. 
Under his leadership, K-State quickly 
became one of the Nation’s distin-
guished research and doctoral univer-
sities. Enrollment increased from 16,000 
students to more than 23,000 under his 
tenure, and with the growth in stu-
dents came a monumental growth in 
research funding from $18 million an-
nually to nearly $134 million. Both of 
these increases have led to astounding 
innovations from all parts of the uni-
versity. Last, but not least of his 
achievements, Dr. Wefald was also in 
charge of hiring the iconic football 
coach Bill Snyder, which led to the 
greatest turnaround in NCAA sports 
history. 
We all mourn the loss of this beloved 
K-State president who shaped count-
less students’ and faculty members’ 
lives. His leadership, passion, and dedi-
cation to K-State and the great State 
of Kansas will never be forgotten. My 
thoughts and prayers go out to his fam-
ily, friends, and K-State family. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the wonderful career and life of 
Mr. Jon Wefald. A true inspiration to 
the State of Kansas, fighting ever 
fighting for a wildcat victory.

TRIBUTE TO JERRY FARLEY 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Jerry 
Farley, the president of Washburn Uni-
versity. Dr. Farley announced his plans 
to retire and transition to a president 
emeritus role, where he and his signa-
ture bow tie will remain a part of fund-
raising and international student re-
cruitment. 
Farley was born in Oklahoma, but 
moved to Topeka in 1997 after spending 
25 years in various administrative roles 
in Oklahoma, including the role of vice 
president at Oklahoma University. On 
July 1, 1997, Farley became Washburn 
University’s 16th president. During his 
leadership, Farley’s vision to change 
Washburn from a commuter school to 
one that prioritized campus life has be-
come a reality. With his wife Susan 
serving by his side through the years, 
they have helped influence and nurture 
student to work hard and leave the 
university as leaders. 
During his tenure, Washburn Univer-
sity added several buildings to its cam-
pus, including the $20 million Living 
Learning Center residential hall, as 
well as the addition of Washburn Tech, 
the Kansas Bureau of Investigation 
Laboratory, and a statue honoring one 
of the Ichobods’ favorite sons, the late 
great Senator Bob Dole. 
In addition to his hard work and 
dedication to help build the reputation 
of the University, Dr. Farley always 
did an outstanding job of representing 
the State of Kansas and Washburn Uni-
versity as a whole. His leadership does 
not go unnoticed. As we celebrate his 
legacy, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the wonderful career of 
Dr. Jerry Farley and wish him and 
Susan nothing but joy and happiness in 
his next chapter of life.

TRIBUTE TO CALEB SMITH 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Caleb 
Smith of Newton, KS. Caleb is the re-
cipient of the 2021–2022 Kansas prin-
cipal of the year. 
Caleb has shown outstanding leader-
ship at Newton High School in order to 
earn this award. His passion for the 
students, working with the staff, and 
creative ideas to enhance technology 
at the school all contributed to this 
great success. Caleb found out about 
this honor Monday, April 11, following 
a school scavenger hunt where he 
walked all over the campus to find his 
students presenting the award to him. 
Superintendent Fred Van Ranken cele-
brated Caleb saying, ‘‘Mr. Smith has 
done an outstanding job of trying to 
create an amazing culture at Newton 
High School and within the Newton 
communities, and it shows. I am so 
happy for Caleb to be recognized at the 
state level for what he and his team 
are doing at USD 373.’’ 
This is an honor that Caleb should be 
immensely proud of. After reading 
through countless quotes from fellow 
teachers and Newton students, it is 
clear that Caleb has a true passion— 
and immense talent—for teaching our 
future leaders. This award is a testa-
ment to all of his hard work in pro-
viding outstanding education for all 
students that walk through his class-
room. I am ecstatic to hear about the 
impact this great Kansan is having on 
our future generations. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Caleb 
Smith of Newton, KS.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO FARHAT QAZI 
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor a Michigander who 
is working every day to build bridges 
and bring people together at a very im-
portant time for our country and our 
world. 
Farhat Qazi of West Bloomfield is an 
entrepreneur and a philanthropist. She 
is also a woman of deep faith who be-
lieves that religion can be a powerful 
force for peace and unity in the world. 
In pursuit of this noble goal, Qazi 
created Children of Abraham Day, 
which was recognized in Michigan on 
December 4, 2020. The day is an oppor-
tunity for Jews, Muslims, and Chris-
tians to celebrate their shared origins 
as descendants of the Prophet Abra-
ham; their reverence for the city of Je-
rusalem; and their common beliefs in 
love, charity, and moral behavior. 
Far too often throughout history, re-
ligious differences have led to strife,

conflict, and war. By focusing on 
shared backgrounds and beliefs—and 
rededicating ourselves to religious un-
derstanding and tolerance—Qazi be-
lieves that people of diverse faiths can 
build a stronger, more peaceful, and 
more prosperous world. I couldn’t agree 
with her more. 
‘‘I believe teaching our children the 
common origins and shared heritage of 
the Abrahamic faiths is key to future 
global unity, peace, and harmony,’’ 
said Qazi. ‘‘Children of Abraham Day is 
about showing how we can come to-
gether, celebrate, and appreciate a 
common bond.’’ 
Farhat Qazi’s belief in the power of 
Children of Abraham Day—and her 
tireless work to bring people of diverse 
religions together—deserves to be com-
mended. It is my hope and prayer that 
this seed of understanding she has 
planted will continue to blossom and 
grow.∑

Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of 
Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OF-
FICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS 
Implementing Certain Substantive Rights 
and Protections of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938, as Required by Section 203 of the 
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
(CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1313. 
NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING 
Background: 
The purpose of this Notice is to initiate 
the process for replacing existing legislative 
branch Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) 
overtime substantive regulations under sec-
tion 203 of the Congressional Accountability 
Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1302 et seq., which were 
adopted by the Board and approved by the 
House and the Senate in 1996, with new regu-
lations that substantially mirror the over-
time exemption regulations promulgated by 
the Secretary of Labor thereafter and pres-
ently in effect. These modifications are nec-
essary in order to bring existing legislative 
branch FLSA overtime regulations in line 
with multiple regulatory changes that have 
occurred since 1996. The regulations that 
presently implement the FLSA for the Legis-
lative Branch are woefully out of date be-
cause the Secretary of Labor’s updated 
FLSA regulations do not automatically 
apply to employing offices and employees 
covered by the CAA. As a result, the employ-
ees of the Legislative Branch are presently 
held to FLSA overtime standards that are no 
longer realistic in today’s economy. 
Do FLSA overtime pay requirements apply 
via the CAA to Legislative Branch employing 
offices? 
Yes. Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA states: 
‘‘[t]he rights and protections established by 
subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 
7, and section 12(c) of the [FLSA] . . . (29 
U.S.C. 206(a)(1), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to cov-
ered employees.’’ Section 7 of the FLSA, 29 
U.S.C. 207, includes the requirements regard-
ing the payment of time and one half over-
time pay to employees. 
Are there existing overtime exemption reg-
ulations already in force under the CAA? 
Yes. In 1996, the Board of Directors of the 
Office of Compliance—now the Office of Con-
gressional Workplace Rights—promulgated 
the existing CAA overtime exemption regu-
lations based on Department of Labor’s regu-
lations that were in effect at the time. Those 
regulations were adopted pursuant to the 
CAA section 304 procedure outlined herein 
below. Those regulations are found at Parts 
H541 (applicable to the House of Representa-
tives), S541 (applicable to the Senate), and 
C541 (applicable to the other employing of-
fices covered by section 203 of the CAA) of 
the FLSA Regulations of the (then) Office of 
Compliance. Those regulations remain in 
force in the Legislative Branch until re-
placed by new regulations. The 1996 FLSA 
Substantive regulations can be accessed via 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
web site: www.ocwr.gov. 
What is the history of the FLSA overtime 
salary threshold test? 
Historically, the salary threshold test con-
tained in the Department of Labor’s regula-
tions has been a fixed amount that has not 
changed with inflation. In 2004, the Depart-
ment of Labor promulgated regulations in-
creasing the salary threshold test so that 
employees with low salaries would not be de-
prived of overtime pay. Thus, in 2004, the 
Board of Directors adopted and submitted for 
publication in the Congressional Record 
amendments to its 1996 substantive regula-
tions regarding the FLSA overtime exemp-
tions. 150 Cong. Rec. H7850–07, S9917–01 (daily 
ed. September 29, 2004). 
The 2004 Amendments to the Legislative 
Branch substantive regulations adopted by 
the Board mirrored new overtime exemption 
regulations promulgated by the Department 
of Labor, Vol. 69 of the Federal Register, No. 
79, at pp. 22122 et seq., which substantially 
changed the prior overtime exemptions. 
More specifically, the 2004 FLSA amend-
ments adopted by the Board of Directors re-
flected the new Part 541 in the updated DOL 
regulations then in effect, which restruc-
tured much of the regulatory framework for 
determining whether a particular employee 
is exempt from FLSA overtime require-
ments. The 2004 changes included: (1) elimi-
nating the ‘‘short’’ and ‘‘long tests and revis-
ing the standard duties test for each exemp-
tion category; (2) significantly increasing 
the salary level under DOL’s revised stand-
ard duties test to $455 per week for execu-
tive, administrative, and professional em-
ployee exemptions and (3) creating a ‘‘highly 
compensated executive’’ category in which 
employees who are paid total annual com-
pensation of at least $100,000 (which must in-
clude at least $455 per week paid on a salary 
or fee basis) are exempt from the FLSA’s 
overtime requirements if they customarily 
and regularly perform at least one of the ex-
empt duties or responsibilities of an execu-
tive, administrative, or professional em-
ployee identified in the standard tests for ex-
emption. 
However, because Congress did not approve 
the 2004 amendments adopted by the Board, 
the 2004 DOL regulations containing FLSA 
exemption updates were not made applicable 
to the Legislative Branch. The regulations 
proposed by the Board in this Notice of Pro-
posed 
Rulemaking 
incorporate 
the 
2004 
amendments 
previously 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board after public notice and comment, and 
further update the overtime exemption regu-
lations to mirror further Department of 
Labor changes in 2016, 2019, and 2020. 
Why is this Notice being issued? 
Over the past 25 years, the Secretary of 
Labor has substantially rewritten and ex-
panded Part 541 and has repeatedly increased 
the salary threshold test. However, the Sec-
retary of Labor’s regulations do not auto-
matically apply to employing offices and em-
ployees covered by the CAA. Because the 2004 
amendments adopted by the Board were not 
approved by Congress, unlike the Depart-
ment of Labor’s current regulations, the 
present salary threshold test within the Leg-
islative Branch sets the salary below the 
poverty level. Specifically, the 1996 Sub-
stantive Regulations has a salary basis test 
of ‘‘not less than $155 per week’’ which is an 
annual salary of less than $8000.00 per year. 
In other sections of the 1996 Substantive 
Regulations that remain applicable to the 
Legislative Branch, the salary basis test is 
‘‘not less than $250 per week’’ which is yearly 
salary of approximately $13,000.00. This No-
tice is being issued, in part, to modify this 
substantially lower salary test set by the 
1996 FLSA Substantive Regulations that are 
financially outdated and yet remain in ef-
fect. 
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is oc-
casioned by the promulgation of new over-
time exemption regulations by the Secretary 
of Labor at Vol. 69 of the Federal Register, 
No. 79, at pp. 22122 et seq., on August 23, 2004; 
Vol. 81 of the Federal Register, at pp. 32391 et 
seq., on May 23, 2016; Vol. 84 of the Federal 
Register, at pp. 51230 et seq., on September 
27, 2019; and Vol. 85 of the Federal Register, 
at pp. 34970–01 et seq., on June 8, 2020. The 
new regulations of the Secretary of Labor as 
set out at 29 U.S.C. Part 541, reflect the sub-
stantial restructuring of overtime exemp-
tions described above, which to date have 
not yet been made applicable to the Legisla-
tive Branch. 
Is the Board proposing to adopt the cur-
rent Department of Labor Regulations ver-
batim? 
The Board has deliberated regarding the 
question of whether ‘‘good cause’’ exists pur-
suant to section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1313(c)(2), for varying these proposed regula-
tions from the Department of Labor regula-
tions. The Board reconsidered comments 
submitted in response to the Notice of Pro-
posed Rulemaking in 2004 and now agrees 
that subsections that refer to occupations 
that do not apply in any manner to the Con-
gressional branch, e.g., § 541.101—Business 
owner and Subpart F—Outside Sales Em-
ployees, should not be retained as part of the 
regulations adopted and/or approved for the 
Legislative branch. Substantive Regulations 
that are focused solely on occupations exist-
ing within the Legislative Branch would be 
more effective for the implementation of the 
rights and protections under this section. As 
a result, these sections are delineated with 
bold brackets in this Notice. 
Why are there separate sets of existing 
FLSA regulations for the House of Represent-
atives, the Senate, and the other employing 
offices covered by the CAA? 
Section 304(a)(2)(B) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1384(a)(2)(B), requires that the substantive 
rules of the Board of Directors ‘‘shall consist 
of 3 separate bodies of regulations, which 
shall apply, respectively, to—(i) the Senate 
and employees of the Senate; (ii) the House 
of Representatives and employees of the 
House of Representatives; and (iii) the other 
covered employees and employing offices.’’ 
In 1996, the House of Representatives (H. Res. 
400) and the Senate (S. Res. 242) each adopted 
by resolution the FLSA regulations applica-
ble to each body. The Senate and House of 
Representatives adopted by concurrent reso-
lution (S. Con. Res. 51) the regulations appli-
cable to other employing offices and employ-
ees. 
Are there substantive differences in the 
proposed regulations for the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Senate, and the other em-
ploying offices? 
No. While there are some differences in 
other parts of the existing FLSA regulations

applicable to the Senate, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the other employing offices 
(chiefly related to the mandate at section 
203(c)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1313(c)(3), re-
garding ‘‘covered employees whose work 
schedules directly depend on the schedule of 
the House of Representatives or the Senate 
. . .’’), the Board of Directors has identified 
no ‘‘good cause’’ for varying the text of these 
regulations. Therefore, if the proposed part 
541 regulations are adopted, the prefixes 
‘‘H’’, ‘‘S’’, and ‘‘C’’ will be affixed to each of 
the sets of regulations for the House, for the 
Senate, and for the other employing offices, 
but the text of the part 541 regulations will 
be identical. 
How are substantive regulations proposed 
and approved under the CAA? 
Section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 
1313(c)(2), requires that the Board of Direc-
tors propose substantive regulations imple-
menting the FLSA overtime requirements 
which are ‘‘the same as substantive regula-
tions promulgated by the Secretary of Labor 
to implement the statutory provisions . . . 
except insofar as the Board may determine, 
for good cause shown and stated together 
with the regulation, that a modification of 
such regulation would be more effective for 
the implementation of the rights and protec-
tions under this section.’’ Pursuant to sec-
tion 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, the proce-
dure for promulgating such substantive regu-
lations requires that: (1) the Board of Direc-
tors adopt proposed substantive regulations 
and publish a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the Congressional Record; (2) 
there be a comment period of at least 30 days 
after the date of publication of the general 
notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) after con-
sideration of comments by the Board of Di-
rectors, that the Board adopt regulations 
and transmit notice of such action together 
with the regulations and a recommendation 
regarding the method for Congressional ap-
proval of the regulations to the Speaker of 
the House and President pro tempore of the 
Senate for publication in the Congressional 
Record; (4) committee referral and action on 
the proposed regulations by resolution in 
each House, concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution; and (5) final publication of 
the approved regulations in the Congres-
sional Record, with an effective date pre-
scribed in the final publication. For more de-
tail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. 
1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
step (1) of the outline set forth above. Unless 
and until all of the steps of the outline set 
forth above are completed, all employing of-
fices and covered employees continue to be 
required to follow the existing 1996 Sub-
stantive Regulations thereby denying many 
Legislative Branch employees of overtime 
benefits that they would likely be entitled to 
pursuant to the current Department of 
Labor overtime regulations. 
How does the Board of Directors rec-
ommend that Congress approve these pro-
posed regulations? 
Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1384(b)(4), the Board of Directors is re-
quired to ‘‘include a recommendation in the 
general notice of proposed rulemaking and in 
the regulations as to whether the regula-
tions should be approved by resolution of the 
Senate, by resolution of the House of Rep-
resentatives, by concurrent resolution, or by 
joint resolution.’’ The Board of Directors 
recommends that the procedure used in 1996 
be used to adopt these proposed overtime ex-
emption regulations: the House of Represent-
atives adopted the ‘‘H’’ version of the regula-
tions by resolution; the Senate adopted the 
‘‘S’’ version of the regulations by resolution; 
and the House and Senate adopted the ‘‘C’’ 
version of the regulations applied to the 
other employing offices by a concurrent res-
olution. 
Are these proposed regulations also rec-
ommended by the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights’ Executive Director, the 
Deputy Executive Director for the House of 
Representatives, and the Deputy Executive 
Director for the Senate? 
Yes, as required by section 304(b)(1) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1), the substance of 
these regulations is also recommended by 
the Executive Director and Deputy Execu-
tive Directors of the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights. 
How similar are the proposed CAA regula-
tions with the current Secretary of Labor 
regulations? 
Except for certain required changes to 
refer to the Legislative Branch instead of the 
Executive Branch, which are shown in the 
accompanying 
proposed 
regulations, 
the 
Board of Directors has repeated the text of 
the regulations at 29 CFR Part 541 verbatim. 
‘‘Good cause’’ for modification of the exist-
ing regulations of the Secretary of Labor, as 
required by section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1313(c)(2), consists of those changes 
needed to reflect the authority of the CAA as 
the enabling statute for these regulations, 
the requirement at section 225(d)(3) of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1361(d)(3), that the CAA ’’shall 
not be construed to authorize enforcement 
by the executive branch of this Act. . . .’’. If 
there is any additional good cause for a par-
ticular proposed variation from the Sec-
retary of Labor’s regulations, it is set out 
adjacent to that provision of the proposed 
regulation. 
Are these proposed CAA regulations avail-
able to persons with disabilities in an alter-
nate format? 
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is 
available on the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights’ web site, www.ocwr.gov 
which is compliant with section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 
U.S.C. 794(d). This Notice can also be made 
available in large print, Braille, or other al-
ternative format. Requests for this Notice in 
an alternative format should be made via 
email to: adaaccess@ocwr.gov. 
30-DAY COMMENT PERIOD REGARDING THE 
PROPOSED REGULATIONS 
How can I submit comments regarding the 
proposed regulations? 
Comments regarding the proposed new 
overtime exemption regulations of the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights set forth 
in this NOTICE are invited for a period of 
thirty (30) days following the date of the ap-
pearance of this NOTICE in the Congres-
sional Record. Submission of comments 
must be made in writing to the Executive Di-
rector, Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights, 
via 
email 
at 
rule- 
comments@ocwr.gov. Copies of submitted 
comments will be available for review on the 
Office’s web site at www.ocwr.gov. 
Supplementary Information: 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (CAA), PL 10–91, was enacted into law on 
January 23, 1995. The CAA applies the rights 
and protections of 12 federal labor and em-
ployment statutes to covered employees and 
employing offices within the Legislative 
Branch of Government. Section 301 of the 
CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381), as amended, establishes 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
as an independent office within the Legisla-
tive Branch. 
HOW TO READ THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS 
The text of the proposed amendments re-
produces the text of the current regulations 
promulgated by the Secretary of Labor at 29 
CFR Part 541, and shows changes proposed 
for the CAA version of these same regula-
tions. Changes proposed by the Board of Di-
rectors of the Office of Congressional Work-
place Rights are shown as follows: deletions 
are marked with a [bracket] and added text 
is bolded within angled <<brackets>>. There-
fore, if these regulations are approved as pro-
posed, the deletion within bracketed text 
will disappear from the regulations and the 
added text within angled brackets will re-
main but not in bold. If these regulations are 
approved for the House of Representatives by 
resolution of the House, they will be promul-
gated with the prefix ‘‘H’’ appearing before 
each regulations section number. If these 
regulations are approved for the Senate by 
resolution of the Senate, they will be pro-
mulgated with the prefix ‘‘S’’ appearing be-
fore each regulations section number. If 
these regulations are approved for the other 
employing offices by joint or concurrent res-
olution of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate, they will be promulgated with 
the prefix ‘‘C’’ appearing before each regula-
tions section number.

SUBPART 
A—GENERAL 
REGULATIONS 
(§§ 541.0–541.4) 
§ 541.0 Introductory statement. 
(a) Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act, as amended, provides an ex-
emption from the Act’s minimum wage and 
overtime requirements for any employee em-
ployed in a bona fide executive, administra-
tive, or professional capacity (including any 
employee employed in the capacity of aca-
demic administrative personnel or teacher in 
elementary or secondary schools)ø, or in the 
capacity of an outside sales employee, as 
such terms are defined and delimited from 
time to time by regulations of the Secretary, 
subject to the provisions of the Administra-
tive Procedure Act.¿ Section 13(a)(17) of the 
Act provides an exemption from the min-
imum wage and overtime requirements for 
computer systems analysts, computer pro-
grammers, software engineers, and other 
similarly skilled computer employees. 
(b) The requirements for these exemptions 
are contained in this part as follows: execu-
tive employees, subpart B; administrative 
employees, subpart C; professional employ-
ees, subpart D; computer employees, subpart 
Eø; outside sales employees, subpart F¿. Sub-
part G contains regulations regarding salary 
requirements applicable to most of the ex-
emptions, including salary levels and the sal-
ary basis test. Subpart G also contains a pro-
vision for exempting certain highly com-
pensated employees. Subpart H contains 
definitions and other miscellaneous provi-
sions applicable to all or several of the ex-
emptions. 
(c) Effective July 1, 1972, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act was amended to include with-
in the protection of the equal pay provisions 
those employees exempt from the minimum 
wage and overtime pay provisions as bona 
fide executive, administrative, and profes-
sional employees (including any employee 
employed in the capacity of academic admin-
istrative personnel or teacher in elementary 
or secondary schools)ø, or in the capacity of 
an outside sales employee under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act¿. The equal pay provisions 
in section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act are administered and enforced by the 
øUnited States Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission¿ <<Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights>>. 
§ 541.1 Terms used in regulations. 
Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938, as amended. 
øAdministrator means the Administrator 
of the Wage and Hour Division, United 
States Department of Labor. The Secretary 
of Labor has delegated to the Administrator 
the functions vested in the Secretary under-
sections 13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act.¿ <<CAA means Con-
gressional Accountability Act of 1995, as 
amended. Office means the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights. Employee means a 
‘‘covered employee’’ as defined in section 
101(3) through (8) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1301(3) 
through (8), but not an ‘‘intern’’ as defined in 
section 
203(a)(2) 
of 
the 
CAA, 
2 
U.S.C. 
1313(a)(2). Employer, company, business, or 
enterprise each mean an ‘‘employing office’’ 
as defined in section 101(9) of the CAA, 2 
U.S.C. 1301(9).>> 
§ 541.2 Job titles insufficient. 
A job title alone is insufficient to establish 
the exempt status of an employee. The ex-
empt or nonexempt status of any particular 
employee must be determined on the basis of 
whether the employee’s salary and duties 
meet the requirements of the regulations in 
this part. 
§ 541.3 Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemp-
tions. 
(a) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the 
regulations in this part do not apply to man-
ual laborers or other ‘‘blue collar’’ workers 
who perform work involving repetitive oper-
ations with their hands, physical skill and 
energy. Such nonexempt ‘‘blue collar’’ em-
ployees gain the skills and knowledge re-
quired for performance of their routine man-
ual and physical work through apprentice-
ships and on-the-job training, not through 
the prolonged course of specialized intellec-
tual instruction required for exempt learned 
professional employees such as medical doc-
tors, architects and archeologists. Thus, for 
example, non-management production-line 
employees and non-management employees 
in maintenance, construction and similar oc-
cupations such as carpenters, electricians, 
mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, crafts-
men, operating engineers, longshoremen, 
construction workers and laborers are enti-
tled to minimum wage and overtime pre-
mium pay under the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, and are not exempt under the regula-
tions in this part no matter how highly paid 
they might be. 
(b)(1) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and 
the regulations in this part also do not apply 
to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, 
state troopers, highway patrol officers, in-
vestigators, inspectors, correctional officers, 
parole or probation officers, park rangers, 
fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical 
technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue 
workers, hazardous materials workers and 
similar employees, regardless of rank or pay 
level, who perform work such as preventing, 
controlling or extinguishing fires of any 
type; rescuing fire, crime or accident vic-
tims; preventing or detecting crimes; con-
ducting investigations or inspections for vio-
lations of law; performing surveillance; pur-
suing, restraining and apprehending sus-
pects; detaining or supervising suspected and 
convicted criminals, including those on pro-
bation or parole; interviewing witnesses; in-
terrogating and fingerprinting suspects; pre-
paring investigative reports; or other similar 
work. 
(2) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt executive employees because their pri-
mary duty is not management of the enter-
prise in which the employee is employed or a 
customarily recognized department or sub-
division thereof as required under § 541.100. 
Thus, for example, a police officer or fire 
fighter whose primary duty is to investigate 
crimes or fight fires is not exempt under sec-
tion 13(a)(1) of the Act merely because the 
police officer or fire fighter also directs the 
work of other employees in the conduct of an 
investigation or fighting a fire. 
(3) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt 
administrative 
employees 
because 
their primary duty is not the performance of 
work directly related to the management or 
general business operations of the employer 
or the employer’s customers as required 
under § 541.200. 
(4) Such employees do not qualify as ex-
empt professionals because their primary 
duty is not the performance of work requir-
ing knowledge of an advanced type in a field 
of science or learning customarily acquired 
by a prolonged course of specialized intellec-
tual instruction or the performance of work 
requiring invention, imagination, originality 
or talent in a recognized field of artistic or 
creative endeavor as required under § 541.300. 
Although some police officers, fire fighters, 
paramedics, emergency medical technicians 
and similar employees have college degrees, 
a specialized academic degree is not a stand-
ard prerequisite for employment in such oc-
cupations. 
§ 541.4 Other laws and collective bargaining 
agreements. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act provides 
minimum standards that may be exceeded, 
but cannot be waived or reduced. Employers 
must comply, for example, with any Federal, 
State or municipal laws, regulations or ordi-
nances establishing a higher minimum wage 
or lower maximum workweek than those es-
tablished under the Act. Similarly, employ-
ers, on their own initiative or under a collec-
tive bargaining agreement with a labor 
union, are not precluded by the Act from 
providing a wage higher than the statutory

minimum, a shorter workweek than the stat-
utory maximum, or a higher overtime pre-
mium (double time, for example) than pro-
vided by the Act. While collective bargaining 
agreements cannot waive or reduce the Act’s 
protections, nothing in the Act or the regu-
lations in this part relieves employers from 
their contractual obligations under collec-
tive bargaining agreements. 
SUBPART 
B—EXECUTIVE 
EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.100–541.106) 
§ 541.100 General rule for executive employ-
ees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide executive capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Compensated on a salary basis pursuant 
to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 per 
week ø(or $455 per week if employed in the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands by employers other than the Federal 
government, or $380 per week if employed in 
American Samoa by employers other than 
the 
Federal 
government)¿, 
exclusive 
of 
board, lodging or other facilities; 
(2) Whose primary duty is management of 
the enterprise in which the employee is em-
ployed or of a customarily recognized depart-
ment or subdivision thereof; 
(3) Who customarily and regularly directs 
the work of two or more other employees; 
and 
(4) Who has the authority to hire or fire 
other employees or whose suggestions and 
recommendations as to the hiring, firing, ad-
vancement, promotion or any other change 
of status of other employees are given par-
ticular weight. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ 
is defined at § 541.606; ‘‘primary duty’’ is de-
fined at § 541.700; and ‘‘customarily and regu-
larly’’ is defined at § 541.701. 
ø§ 541.101 Business owner. 
The term ‘‘employee employed in a bona 
fide executive capacity’’ in section 13(a)(1) of 
the Act also includes any employee who 
owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity 
interest in the enterprise in which the em-
ployee is employed, regardless of whether 
the business is a corporate or other type of 
organization, and who is actively engaged in 
its management. The term ‘‘management’’ is 
defined in § 541.102. The requirements of Sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do 
not apply to the business owners described in 
this section.¿ 
§ 541.102 Management. 
Generally, ‘‘management’’ includes, but is 
not limited to, activities such as inter-
viewing, selecting, and training of employ-
ees; setting and adjusting their rates of pay 
and hours of work; directing the work of em-
ployees; maintaining production or sales 
records for use in supervision or control; ap-
praising employees’ productivity and effi-
ciency for the purpose of recommending pro-
motions or other changes in status; handling 
employee complaints and grievances; dis-
ciplining employees; planning the work; de-
termining the techniques to be used; appor-
tioning the work among the employees; de-
termining the type of materials, supplies, 
machinery, equipment or tools to be used or 
merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; 
controlling the flow and distribution of ma-
terials or merchandise and supplies; pro-
viding for the safety and security of the em-
ployees or the property; planning and con-
trolling the budget; and monitoring or im-
plementing legal compliance measures. 
§ 541.103 Department or subdivision. 
(a) The phrase ‘‘a customarily recognized 
department or subdivision’’ is intended to 
distinguish between a mere collection of em-
ployees assigned from time to time to a spe-
cific job or series of jobs and a unit with per-
manent status and function. A customarily 
recognized department or subdivision must 
have a permanent status and a continuing 
function. For example, a large employer’s 
human resources department might have 
subdivisions for labor relations, pensions and 
other benefits, equal employment oppor-
tunity, and personnel management, each of 
which has a permanent status and function. 
(b) When an enterprise has more than one 
establishment, the employee in charge of 
each establishment may be considered in 
charge of a recognized subdivision of the en-
terprise. 
(c) A recognized department or subdivision 
need not be physically within the employer’s 
establishment and may move from place to 
place. The mere fact that the employee 
works in more than one location does not in-
validate the exemption if other factors show 
that the employee is actually in charge of a 
recognized unit with a continuing function 
in the organization. 
(d) Continuity of the same subordinate per-
sonnel is not essential to the existence of a 
recognized unit with a continuing function. 
An otherwise exempt employee will not lose 
the exemption merely because the employee 
draws and supervises workers from a pool or 
supervises a team of workers drawn from 
other recognized units, if other factors are 
present that indicate that the employee is in 
charge of a recognized unit with a con-
tinuing function. 
§ 541.104 Two or more other employees. 
(a) To qualify as an exempt executive 
under § 541.100, the employee must custom-
arily and regularly direct the work of two or 
more other employees. The phrase ‘‘two or 
more other employees’’ means two full-time 
employees or their equivalent. One full-time 
and two half-time employees, for example, 
are equivalent to two full-time employees. 
Four half-time employees are also equiva-
lent. 
(b) The supervision can be distributed 
among two, three or more employees, but 
each such employee must customarily and 
regularly direct the work of two or more 
other full-time employees or the equivalent. 
Thus, for example, a department with five 
full-time nonexempt workers may have up to 
two exempt supervisors if each such super-
visor customarily and regularly directs the 
work of two of those workers. 
(c) An employee who merely assists the 
manager of a particular department and su-
pervises two or more employees only in the 
actual manager’s absence does not meet this 
requirement. 
(d) Hours worked by an employee cannot 
be credited more than once for different ex-
ecutives. Thus, a shared responsibility for 
the supervision of the same two employees in 
the same department does not satisfy this 
requirement. However, a full-time employee 
who works four hours for one supervisor and 
four hours for a different supervisor, for ex-
ample, can be credited as a half-time em-
ployee for both supervisors. 
§ 541.105 Particular weight. 
To determine whether an employee’s sug-
gestions and recommendations are given 
‘‘particular weight,’’ factors to be considered 
include, but are not limited to, whether it is 
part of the employee’s job duties to make 
such suggestions and recommendations; the 
frequency with which such suggestions and 
recommendations are made or requested; and 
the frequency with which the employee’s 
suggestions and recommendations are relied 
upon. Generally, an executive’s suggestions 
and recommendations must pertain to em-
ployees whom the executive customarily and 
regularly directs. It does not include an oc-
casional suggestion with regard to the 
change in status of a co-worker. An employ-
ee’s suggestions and recommendations may 
still be deemed to have ‘‘particular weight’’ 
even 
if 
a 
higher 
level 
manager’s 
rec-
ommendation has more importance and even 
if the employee does not have authority to 
make the ultimate decision as to the em-
ployee’s change in status. 
§ 541.106 Concurrent duties. 
(a) Concurrent performance of exempt and 
nonexempt work does not disqualify an em-
ployee from the executive exemption if the 
requirements of § 541.100 are otherwise met. 
Whether an employee meets the require-
ments of § 541.100 when the employee per-
forms concurrent duties is determined on a 
case-by-case basis and based on the factors 
set forth in § 541.700. Generally, exempt ex-
ecutives make the decision regarding when 
to perform nonexempt duties and remain re-
sponsible for the success or failure of busi-
ness operations under their management 
while performing the nonexempt work. In 
contrast, the nonexempt employee generally 
is directed by a supervisor to perform the ex-
empt work or performs the exempt work for 
defined time periods. An employee whose pri-
mary duty is ordinary production work or 
routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot 
qualify for exemption as an executive. 
(b) For example, an assistant manager in a 
retail establishment may perform work such 
as serving customers, cooking food, stocking 
shelves and cleaning the establishment, but 
performance of such nonexempt work does 
not preclude the exemption if the assistant 
manager’s primary duty is management. An 
assistant manager can supervise employees 
and serve customers at the same time with-
out losing the exemption. An exempt em-
ployee can also simultaneously direct the 
work of other employees and stock shelves. 
(c) In contrast, a relief supervisor or work-
ing supervisor whose primary duty is per-
forming nonexempt work on the production 
line in a manufacturing plant does not be-
come exempt merely because the nonexempt 
production line employee occasionally has 
some responsibility for directing the work of 
other nonexempt production line employees 
when, for example, the exempt supervisor is 
unavailable. Similarly, an employee whose 
primary duty is to work as an electrician is 
not an exempt executive even if the em-
ployee also directs the work of other employ-
ees on the job site, orders parts and mate-
rials for the job, and handles requests from 
the prime contractor.

April 26, 2022 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.201 Directly related to management or 
general business operations. 
(a) To qualify for the administrative ex-
emption, an employee’s primary duty must 
be the performance of work directly related 
to the management or general business oper-
ations of the employer or the employer’s cus-
tomers. The phrase ‘‘directly related to the 
management or general business operations’’ 
refers to the type of work performed by the 
employee. To meet this requirement, an em-
ployee must perform work directly related to 
assisting with the running or servicing of the 
business, as distinguished, for example, from 
working on a manufacturing production line 
or selling a product in a retail or service es-
tablishment. 
(b) Work directly related to management 
or general business operations includes, but 
is not limited to, work in functional areas 
such as tax; finance; accounting; budgeting; 
auditing; insurance; quality control; pur-
chasing; 
procurement; 
advertising; 
mar-
keting; research; safety and health; per-
sonnel management; human resources; em-
ployee benefits; labor relations; public rela-
tions, government relations; computer net-
work, internet and database administration; 
legal and regulatory compliance; and similar 
activities. Some of these activities may be 
performed by employees who also would 
qualify for another exemption. 
(c) An employee may qualify for the ad-
ministrative exemption if the employee’s 
primary duty is the performance of work di-
rectly related to the management or general 
business operations of the employer’s cus-
tomers. Thus, for example, employees acting 
as advisers or consultants to their employ-
er’s clients or customers (as tax experts or 
financial consultants, for example) may be 
exempt. 
§ 541.202 Discretion and independent judg-
ment. 
(a) To qualify for the administrative ex-
emption, an employee’s primary duty must 
include the exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment with respect to matters of 
significance. In general, the exercise of dis-
cretion and independent judgment involves 
the comparison and the evaluation of pos-
sible courses of conduct, and acting or mak-
ing a decision after the various possibilities 
have been considered. The term ‘‘matters of 
significance’’ refers to the level of impor-
tance or consequence of the work performed. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘discretion and independent 
judgment’’ must be applied in the light of all 
the facts involved in the particular employ-
ment situation in which the question arises. 
Factors 
to 
consider 
when 
determining 
whether an employee exercises discretion 
and independent judgment with respect to 
matters of significance include, but are not 
limited to: whether the employee has au-
thority to formulate, affect, interpret, or im-
plement management policies or operating 
practices; whether the employee carries out 
major assignments in conducting the oper-
ations of the business; whether the employee 
performs work that affects business oper-
ations to a substantial degree, even if the 
employee’s assignments are related to oper-
ation of a particular segment of the business; 
whether the employee has authority to com-
mit the employer in matters that have sig-
nificant financial impact; whether the em-
ployee has authority to waive or deviate 
from established policies and procedures 
without prior approval; whether the em-
ployee has authority to negotiate and bind 
the company on significant matters; whether 
the employee provides consultation or expert 
advice to management; whether the em-
ployee is involved in planning long- or short- 
term business objectives; whether the em-
ployee investigates and resolves matters of 
significance on behalf of management; and 
whether the employee represents the com-
pany in handling complaints, arbitrating dis-
putes or resolving grievances. 
(c) The exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment implies that the employee 
has authority to make an independent 
choice, free from immediate direction or su-
pervision. However, employees can exercise 
discretion and independent judgment even if 
their decisions or recommendations are re-
viewed at a higher level. Thus, the term 
‘‘discretion and independent judgment’’ does 
not require that the decisions made by an 
employee have a finality that goes with un-
limited authority and a complete absence of 
review. The decisions made as a result of the 
exercise of discretion and independent judg-
ment may consist of recommendations for 
action rather than the actual taking of ac-
tion. The fact that an employee’s decision 
may be subject to review and that upon occa-
sion the decisions are revised or reversed 
after review does not mean that the em-
ployee is not exercising discretion and inde-
pendent judgment. For example, the policies 
formulated by the credit manager of a large 
corporation may be subject to review by 
higher company officials who may approve 
or disapprove these policies. The manage-
ment consultant who has made a study of 
the operations of a business and who has 
drawn a proposed change in organization 
may have the plan reviewed or revised by su-
periors before it is submitted to the client. 
(d) An employer’s volume of business may 
make it necessary to employ a number of 
employees to perform the same or similar 
work. The fact that many employees perform 
identical work or work of the same relative 
importance does not mean that the work of 
each such employee does not involve the ex-
ercise of discretion and independent judg-
ment with respect to matters of significance. 
(e) The exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment must be more than the use 
of skill in applying well-established tech-
niques, procedures or specific standards de-
scribed in manuals or other sources. See also 
§ 541.704 regarding use of manuals. The exer-
cise of discretion and independent judgment 
also does not include clerical or secretarial 
work, recording or tabulating data, or per-
forming other mechanical, repetitive, recur-
rent or routine work. An employee who sim-
ply tabulates data is not exempt, even if la-
beled as a ‘‘statistician.’’ 
(f) An employee does not exercise discre-
tion and independent judgment with respect 
to matters of significance merely because 
the employer will experience financial losses 
if the employee fails to perform the job prop-
erly. For example, a messenger who is en-
trusted with carrying large sums of money 
does not exercise discretion and independent 
judgment with respect to matters of signifi-
cance even though serious consequences may 
flow from the employee’s neglect. Similarly, 
an employee who operates very expensive 
equipment does not exercise discretion and 
independent judgment with respect to mat-
ters of significance merely because improper 
performance of the employee’s duties may 
cause serious financial loss to the employer. 
§ 541.203 Administrative exemption examples. 
(a) Insurance claims adjusters generally 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption, whether they work for 
an insurance company or other type of com-
pany, if their duties include activities such 
as interviewing insureds, witnesses and phy-
sicians; inspecting property damage; review-
ing factual information to prepare damage 
estimates; 
evaluating 
and 
making 
rec-
ommendations regarding coverage of claims; 
determining liability and total value of a 
claim; negotiating settlements; and making 
recommendations regarding litigation. 
(b) Employees in the financial services in-
dustry generally meet the duties require-
ments for the administrative exemption if 
their duties include work such as collecting 
and analyzing information regarding the cus-
tomer’s 
income, 
assets, 
investments 
or 
debts; determining which financial products 
best meet the customer’s needs and financial 
circumstances; advising the customer re-
garding the advantages and disadvantages of 
different financial products; and marketing, 
servicing or promoting the employer’s finan-
cial products. However, an employee whose 
primary duty is selling financial products 
does not qualify for the administrative ex-
emption. 
(c) An employee who leads a team of other 
employees 
assigned 
to 
complete 
major 
projects for the employer (such as pur-
chasing, selling or closing all or part of the 
business, negotiating a real estate trans-
action or a collective bargaining agreement, 
or designing and implementing productivity 
improvements) generally meets the duties 
requirements for the administrative exemp-
tion, even if the employee does not have di-
rect supervisory responsibility over the 
other employees on the team. 
(d) An executive assistant or administra-
tive assistant to a business owner or senior 
executive of a large business generally meets 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption if such employee, without 
specific instructions or prescribed proce-
dures, has been delegated authority regard-
ing matters of significance. 
(e) Human resources managers who formu-
late, interpret or implement employment 
policies and management consultants who 
study the operations of a business and pro-
pose changes in organization generally meet 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption. However, personnel clerks 
who ‘‘screen’’ applicants to obtain data re-
garding their minimum qualifications and 
fitness for employment generally do not 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption. Such personnel clerks 
typically will reject all applicants who do 
not meet minimum standards for the par-
ticular job or for employment by the com-
pany. The minimum standards are usually 
set by the exempt human resources manager 
or other company officials, and the decision 
to hire from the group of qualified applicants 
who do meet the minimum standards is simi-
larly made by the exempt human resources 
manager or other company officials. Thus, 
when the interviewing and screening func-
tions are performed by the human resources 
manager or personnel manager who makes 
the hiring decision or makes recommenda-
tions for hiring from the pool of qualified ap-
plicants, such duties constitute exempt 
work, even though routine, because this 
work is directly and closely related to the 
employee’s exempt functions. 
(f) Purchasing agents with authority to 
bind the company on significant purchases 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption even if they 
must consult with top management officials 
when making a purchase commitment for 
raw materials in excess of the contemplated 
plant needs. 
(g) Ordinary inspection work generally 
does not meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption. Inspectors 
normally perform specialized work along 
standardized lines involving well-established 
techniques and procedures which may have 
been catalogued and described in manuals or 
other sources. Such inspectors rely on tech-
niques and skills acquired by special training

or experience. They have some leeway in the 
performance of their work but only within 
closely prescribed limits. 
(h) Employees usually called examiners or 
graders, such as employees that grade lum-
ber, generally do not meet the duties re-
quirements for the administrative exemp-
tion. Such employees usually perform work 
involving the comparison of products with 
established standards which are frequently 
catalogued. Often, after continued reference 
to the written standards, or through experi-
ence, 
the 
employee 
acquires 
sufficient 
knowledge so that reference to written 
standards is unnecessary. The substitution 
of the employee’s memory for a manual of 
standards does not convert the character of 
the work performed to exempt work requir-
ing the exercise of discretion and inde-
pendent judgment. 
(i) Comparison shopping performed by an 
employee of a retail store who merely re-
ports to the buyer the prices at a competi-
tor’s store does not qualify for the adminis-
trative exemption. However, the buyer who 
evaluates such reports on competitor prices 
to set the employer’s prices generally meets 
the duties requirements for the administra-
tive exemption. 
(j) Public sector inspectors or investigators 
of various types, such as fire prevention or 
safety, building or construction, health or 
sanitation, environmental or soils specialists 
and similar employees, generally do not 
meet the duties requirements for the admin-
istrative exemption because their work typi-
cally does not involve work directly related 
to the management or general business oper-
ations of the employer. Such employees also 
do not qualify for the administrative exemp-
tion because their work involves the use of 
skills and technical abilities in gathering 
factual information, applying known stand-
ards or prescribed procedures, determining 
which procedure to follow, or determining 
whether prescribed standards or criteria are 
met. 
§ 541.204 Educational establishments. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide administrative capacity’’ in sec-
tion 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes employ-
ees: 
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis at 
a rate of not less than $684 per week ø(or $455 
per week if employed in the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by 
employers other than the Federal govern-
ment, or $380 per week if employed in Amer-
ican Samoa by employers other than the 
Federal government)¿, exclusive of board, 
lodging, or other facilities; or on a salary 
basis which is at least equal to the entrance 
salary for teachers in the educational estab-
lishment by which employed; and 
(2) Whose primary duty is performing ad-
ministrative functions directly related to 
academic instruction or training in an edu-
cational establishment or department or 
subdivision thereof. 
(b) The term ‘‘educational establishment’’ 
means an elementary or secondary school 
system, an institution of higher education or 
other educational institution. Sections 3(v) 
and 3(w) of the Act define elementary and 
secondary schools as those day or residential 
schools that provide elementary or sec-
ondary education, as determined under State 
law. Under the laws of most States, such 
education includes the curriculums in grades 
1 through 12; under many it includes also the 
introductory 
programs 
in 
kindergarten. 
Such education in some States may also in-
clude nursery school programs in elementary 
education and junior college curriculums in 
secondary education. The term ‘‘other edu-
cational 
establishment’’ 
includes 
special 
schools for mentally or physically disabled 
or gifted children, regardless of any classi-
fication of such schools as elementary, sec-
ondary or higher. Factors relevant in deter-
mining whether post-secondary career pro-
grams are educational institutions include 
whether the school is licensed by a state 
agency responsible for the state’s edu-
cational system or accredited by a nation-
ally recognized accrediting organization for 
career schools. Also, for purposes of the ex-
emption, no distinction is drawn between 
public and private schools, or between those 
operated for profit and those that are not for 
profit. 
(c) The phrase ‘‘performing administrative 
functions directly related to academic in-
struction or training’’ means work related to 
the academic operations and functions in a 
school rather than to administration along 
the lines of general business operations. 
Such academic administrative functions in-
clude operations directly in the field of edu-
cation. Jobs relating to areas outside the 
educational field are not within the defini-
tion of academic administration. 
(1) Employees engaged in academic admin-
istrative 
functions 
include: 
the 
super-
intendent or other head of an elementary or 
secondary school system, and any assistants, 
responsible for administration of such mat-
ters as curriculum, quality and methods of 
instructing, measuring and testing the learn-
ing potential and achievement of students, 
establishing and maintaining academic and 
grading standards, and other aspects of the 
teaching program; the principal and any 
vice-principals responsible for the operation 
of an elementary or secondary school; de-
partment heads in institutions of higher edu-
cation responsible for the administration of 
the mathematics department, the English 
department, the foreign language depart-
ment, etc.; academic counselors who perform 
work such as administering school testing 
programs, assisting students with academic 
problems and advising students concerning 
degree requirements; and other employees 
with similar responsibilities. 
(2) Jobs relating to building management 
and maintenance, jobs relating to the health 
of the students, and academic staff such as 
social workers, psychologists, lunch room 
managers or dietitians do not perform aca-
demic administrative functions. Although 
such work is not considered academic admin-
istration, such employees may qualify for ex-
emption under § 541.200or under other sec-
tions of this part, provided the requirements 
for such exemptions are met. 
SUBPART D—PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.300–541.304) 
§ 541.300 General rule for professional em-
ployees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis 
pursuant to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than 
$684 per week ø(or $455 per week if employed 
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
iana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands by employers other than the 
Federal government, or $380 per week if em-
ployed in American Samoa by employers 
other than the Federal government)¿, exclu-
sive of board, lodging or other facilities; and 
(2) Whose primary duty is the performance 
of work: 
(i) Requiring knowledge of an advanced 
type in a field of science or learning custom-
arily acquired by a prolonged course of spe-
cialized intellectual instruction; or 
(ii) Requiring invention, imagination, orig-
inality or talent in a recognized field of ar-
tistic or creative endeavor. 
(b) The term ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘fee basis’’ is defined at § 541.605; 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.301 Learned professionals. 
(a) To qualify for the learned professional 
exemption, an employee’s primary duty 
must be the performance of work requiring 
advanced knowledge in a field of science or 
learning customarily acquired by a pro-
longed course of specialized intellectual in-
struction. This primary duty test includes 
three elements: 
(1) The employee must perform work re-
quiring advanced knowledge; 
(2) The advanced knowledge must be in a 
field of science or learning; and 
(3) The advanced knowledge must be cus-
tomarily acquired by a prolonged course of 
specialized intellectual instruction. 
(b) The phrase ‘‘work requiring advanced 
knowledge’’ means work which is predomi-
nantly intellectual in character, and which 
includes work requiring the consistent exer-
cise of discretion and judgment, as distin-
guished from performance of routine mental, 
manual, mechanical or physical work. An 
employee who performs work requiring ad-
vanced knowledge generally uses the ad-
vanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or 
make deductions from varying facts or cir-
cumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be 
attained at the high school level. 
(c) The phrase ‘‘field of science or learn-
ing’’ includes the traditional professions of 
law, medicine, theology, accounting, actu-
arial computation, engineering, architec-
ture, teaching, various types of physical, 
chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy 
and other similar occupations that have a 
recognized professional status as distin-
guished from the mechanical arts or skilled 
trades where in some instances the knowl-
edge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not 
in a field of science or learning. 
(d) The phrase ‘‘customarily acquired by a 
prolonged course of specialized intellectual 
instruction’’ restricts the exemption to pro-
fessions where specialized academic training 
is a standard prerequisite for entrance into 
the profession. The best prima facie evidence 
that an employee meets this requirement is 
possession of the appropriate academic de-
gree. However, the word ‘‘customarily’’ 
means that the exemption is also available 
to employees in such professions who have 
substantially the same knowledge level and 
perform substantially the same work as the 
degreed employees, but who attained the ad-
vanced knowledge through a combination of 
work experience and intellectual instruc-
tion. Thus, for example, the learned profes-
sional exemption is available to the occa-
sional lawyer who has not gone to law 
school, or the occasional chemist who is not 
the possessor of a degree in chemistry. How-
ever, the learned professional exemption is 
not available for occupations that custom-
arily may be performed with only the gen-
eral knowledge acquired by an academic de-
gree in any field, with knowledge acquired 
through an apprenticeship, or with training 
in the performance of routine mental, man-
ual, mechanical or physical processes. The 
learned professional exemption also does not 
apply to occupations in which most employ-
ees have acquired their skill by experience 
rather than by advanced specialized intellec-
tual instruction. 
(e)(1) Registered or certified medical tech-
nologists. Registered or certified medical 
technologists who have successfully com-
pleted three academic years of pre-profes-
sional study in an accredited college or uni-
versity plus a fourth year of professional 
course work in a school of medical tech-
nology approved by the Council of Medical 
Education of the American Medical Associa-
tion generally meet the duties requirements 
for the learned professional exemption.

(2) Nurses. Registered nurses who are reg-
istered by the appropriate State examining 
board generally meet the duties require-
ments for the learned professional exemp-
tion. Licensed practical nurses and other 
similar health care employees, however, gen-
erally do not qualify as exempt learned pro-
fessionals because possession of a specialized 
advanced academic degree is not a standard 
prerequisite for entry into such occupations. 
(3) Dental hygienists. Dental hygienists 
who have successfully completed four aca-
demic years of pre-professional and profes-
sional study in an accredited college or uni-
versity approved by the Commission on Ac-
creditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary 
Educational Programs of the American Den-
tal Association generally meet the duties re-
quirements for the learned professional ex-
emption. 
(4) Physician assistants. Physician assist-
ants who have successfully completed four 
academic years of pre-professional and pro-
fessional study, including graduation from a 
physician assistant program accredited by 
the Accreditation Review Commission on 
Education for the Physician Assistant, and 
who are certified by the National Commis-
sion on Certification of Physician Assistants 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the learned professional exemption. 
(5) Accountants. Certified public account-
ants generally meet the duties requirements 
for the learned professional exemption. In 
addition, many other accountants who are 
not certified public accountants but perform 
similar job duties may qualify as exempt 
learned professionals. However, accounting 
clerks, bookkeepers and other employees 
who normally perform a great deal of routine 
work generally will not qualify as exempt 
professionals. 
(6) Chefs. Chefs, such as executive chefs 
and sous chefs, who have attained a four- 
year specialized academic degree in a cul-
inary arts program, generally meet the du-
ties requirements for the learned profes-
sional exemption. The learned professional 
exemption is not available to cooks who per-
form predominantly routine mental, manual, 
mechanical or physical work. 
(7) Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assist-
ants generally do not qualify as exempt 
learned professionals because an advanced 
specialized academic degree is not a standard 
prerequisite for entry into the field. Al-
though many paralegals possess general 
four-year advanced degrees, most specialized 
paralegal programs are two-year associate 
degree programs from a community college 
or 
equivalent 
institution. 
However, 
the 
learned professional exemption is available 
for paralegals who possess advanced special-
ized degrees in other professional fields and 
apply advanced knowledge in that field in 
the performance of their duties. For exam-
ple, if a law firm hires an engineer as a para-
legal to provide expert advice on product li-
ability cases or to assist on patent matters, 
that engineer would qualify for exemption. 
(8) Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who 
have successfully completed four academic 
years of pre-professional and professional 
study in a specialized curriculum accredited 
by the Commission on Accreditation of Al-
lied Health Education Programs and who are 
certified by the Board of Certification of the 
National 
Athletic 
Trainers 
Association 
Board of Certification generally meet the du-
ties requirements for the learned profes-
sional exemption. 
ø(9) Funeral directors or embalmers. Li-
censed funeral directors and embalmers who 
are licensed by and working in a state that 
requires successful completion of four aca-
demic years of pre-professional and profes-
sional study, including graduation from a 
college of mortuary science accredited by 
the American Board of Funeral Service Edu-
cation, generally meet the duties require-
ments for the learned professional exemp-
tion.¿ 
(f) The areas in which the professional ex-
emption may be available are expanding. As 
knowledge is developed, academic training is 
broadened and specialized degrees are offered 
in new and diverse fields, thus creating new 
specialists in particular fields of science or 
learning. When an advanced specialized de-
gree has become a standard requirement for 
a particular occupation, that occupation 
may have acquired the characteristics of a 
learned profession. Accrediting and certi-
fying organizations similar to those listed in 
paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(8) of 
this section also may be created in the fu-
ture. Such organizations may develop simi-
lar specialized curriculums and certification 
programs which, if a standard requirement 
for a particular occupation, may indicate 
that the occupation has acquired the charac-
teristics of a learned profession. 
§ 541.302 Creative professionals. 
(a) To qualify for the creative professional 
exemption, an employee’s primary duty 
must be the performance of work requiring 
invention, imagination, originality or talent 
in a recognized field of artistic or creative 
endeavor as opposed to routine mental, man-
ual, mechanical or physical work. The ex-
emption does not apply to work which can be 
produced by a person with general manual or 
intellectual ability and training. 
(b) To qualify for exemption as a creative 
professional, the work performed must be 
‘‘in a recognized field of artistic or creative 
endeavor.’’ This includes such fields as 
music, writing, acting and the graphic arts. 
(c) The requirement of ‘‘invention, imagi-
nation, originality or talent’’ distinguishes 
the creative professions from work that pri-
marily depends on intelligence, diligence and 
accuracy. The duties of employees vary 
widely, and exemption as a creative profes-
sional depends on the extent of the inven-
tion, imagination, originality or talent exer-
cised by the employee. Determination of ex-
empt creative professional status, therefore, 
must be made on a case-by-case basis. This 
requirement generally is met by actors, mu-
sicians, composers, conductors, and soloists; 
painters who at most are given the subject 
matter of their painting; cartoonists who are 
merely told the title or underlying concept 
of a cartoon and must rely on their own cre-
ative ability to express the concept; essay-
ists, 
novelists, 
short-story 
writers 
and 
screen-play writers who choose their own 
subjects and hand in a finished piece of work 
to their employers (the majority of such per-
sons are, of course, not employees but self- 
employed); and persons holding the more re-
sponsible writing positions in advertising 
agencies. This requirement generally is not 
met by a person who is employed as a copy-
ist, as an ‘‘animator’’ of motion-picture car-
toons, or as a retoucher of photographs, 
since such work is not properly described as 
creative in character. 
(d) Journalists may satisfy the duties re-
quirements for the creative professional ex-
emption if their primary duty is work re-
quiring invention, imagination, originality 
or talent, as opposed to work which depends 
primarily on intelligence, diligence and ac-
curacy. Employees of newspapers, maga-
zines, television and other media are not ex-
empt creative professionals if they only col-
lect, organize and record information that is 
routine or already public, or if they do not 
contribute a unique interpretation or anal-
ysis to a news product. Thus, for example, 
newspaper reporters who merely rewrite 
press releases or who write standard re-
counts of public information by gathering 
facts on routine community events are not 
exempt 
creative 
professionals. 
Reporters 
also do not qualify as exempt creative pro-
fessionals if their work product is subject to 
substantial control by the employer. How-
ever, journalists may qualify as exempt cre-
ative professionals if their primary duty is 
performing on the air in radio, television or 
other electronic media; conducting inves-
tigative 
interviews; 
analyzing 
or 
inter-
preting public events; writing editorials, 
opinion columns or other commentary; or 
acting as a narrator or commentator. 
§ 541.303 Teachers. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act also means any employee 
with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, 
instructing or lecturing in the activity of 
imparting knowledge and who is employed 
and engaged in this activity as a teacher in 
an educational establishment by which the 
employee is employed. The term ‘‘edu-
cational 
establishment’’ 
is 
defined 
in 
§ 541.204(b). 
(b) Exempt teachers include, but are not 
limited 
to: 
Regular 
academic 
teachers; 
teachers of kindergarten or nursery school 
pupils; teachers of gifted or disabled chil-
dren; teachers of skilled and semi-skilled 
trades and occupations; teachers engaged in 
automobile 
driving 
instruction; 
aircraft 
flight instructors; home economics teachers; 
and vocal or instrumental music instructors. 
Those faculty members who are engaged as 
teachers but also spend a considerable 
amount of their time in extracurricular ac-
tivities such as coaching athletic teams or 
acting as moderators or advisors in such 
areas as drama, speech, debate or journalism 
are engaged in teaching. Such activities are 
a recognized part of the schools’ responsi-
bility in contributing to the educational de-
velopment of the student. 
(c) The possession of an elementary or sec-
ondary teacher’s certificate provides a clear 
means of identifying the individuals con-
templated as being within the scope of the 
exemption for teaching professionals. Teach-
ers who possess a teaching certificate qualify 
for the exemption regardless of the termi-
nology (e.g., permanent, conditional, stand-
ard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or 
unlimited) used by the State to refer to dif-
ferent kinds of certificates. However, private 
schools and public schools are not uniform in 
requiring a certificate for employment as an 
elementary or secondary school teacher, and 
a teacher’s certificate is not generally nec-
essary for employment in institutions of 
higher education or other educational estab-
lishments. Therefore, a teacher who is not 
certified may be considered for exemption, 
provided that such individual is employed as 
a teacher by the employing school or school 
system. 
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and Sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do 
not apply to the teaching professionals de-
scribed in this section. 
§ 541.304 Practice of law or medicine. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in a 
bona fide professional capacity’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act also shall mean: 
(1) Any employee who is the holder of a 
valid license or certificate permitting the 
practice of law or medicine or any of their 
branches and is actually engaged in the prac-
tice thereof; and 
(2) Any employee who is the holder of the 
requisite academic degree for the general 
practice of medicine and is engaged in an in-
ternship or resident program pursuant to the 
practice of the profession. 
(b) In the case of medicine, the exemption 
applies to physicians and other practitioners 
licensed and practicing in the field of med-
ical science and healing or any of the med-
ical specialties practiced by physicians or

practitioners. The term ‘‘physicians’’ in-
cludes medical doctors including general 
practitioners and specialists, osteopathic 
physicians (doctors of osteopathy), podia-
trists, dentists (doctors of dental medicine), 
and optometrists (doctors of optometry or 
bachelors of science in optometry). 
(c) Employees engaged in internship or 
resident programs, whether or not licensed 
to practice prior to commencement of the 
program, qualify as exempt professionals if 
they enter such internship or resident pro-
grams after the earning of the appropriate 
degree required for the general practice of 
their profession. 
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and sub-
part G (salary requirements) of this part do

section. 
SUBPART 
E—COMPUTER 
EMPLOYEES 
(§§ 541.400–541.402) 
§ 541.400 General rule for computer employ-
ees. 
(a) Computer systems analysts, computer 
programmers, software engineers or other 
similarly skilled workers in the computer 
field are eligible for exemption as profes-
sionals under section 13(a)(1) of the Act and 
under section 13(a)(17) of the Act. Because 
job titles vary widely and change quickly in 
the computer industry, job titles are not de-
terminative of the applicability of this ex-
emption. 
(b) The section 13(a)(1)exemption applies to 
any computer employee who is compensated 
on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less 
than $684 per week ø(or $455 per week if em-
ployed in the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or 
the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other 
than the Federal government, or $380 per 
week if employed in American Samoa by em-
ployers other than the Federal govern-
ment)¿, exclusive of board, lodging, or other 
facilities. 
The section 13(a)(17) exemption applies to 
any computer employee compensated on an 
hourly basis at a rate of not less than $27.63 
an hour. In addition, under either section 
13(a)(1) or section 13(a)(17) of the Act, the ex-
emptions apply only to computer employees 
whose primary duty consists of: 
(1) The application of systems analysis 
techniques and procedures, including con-
sulting with users, to determine hardware, 
software or system functional specifications; 
(2) The design, development, documenta-
tion, analysis, creation, testing or modifica-
tion of computer systems or programs, in-
cluding prototypes, based on and related to 
user or system design specifications; 
(3) The design, documentation, testing, 
creation or modification of computer pro-
grams related to machine operating systems; 
or 
(4) A combination of the aforementioned 
duties, the performance of which requires 
the same level of skills. 
(c) The term ‘‘salary basis’’ is defined at 
§ 541.602; ‘‘fee basis’’ is defined at § 541.605; 
‘‘board, lodging or other facilities’’ is defined 
at § 541.606; and ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. 
§ 541.401 Computer manufacture and repair. 
The exemption for employees in computer 
occupations does not include employees en-
gaged in the manufacture or repair of com-
puter hardware and related equipment. Em-
ployees whose work is highly dependent 
upon, or facilitated by, the use of computers 
and computer software programs (e.g., engi-
neers, drafters and others skilled in com-
puter-aided design software), but who are not 
primarily engaged in computer systems 
analysis and programming or other similarly 
skilled computer-related occupations identi-
fied in § 541.400(b), are also not exempt com-
puter professionals. 
§ 541.402 Executive and administrative com-
puter employees. 
Computer employees within the scope of 
this exemption, as well as those employees 
not within its scope, may also have execu-
tive and administrative duties which qualify 
the employees for exemption under subpart 
B or subpart C of this part. For example, sys-
tems analysts and computer programmers 
generally meet the duties requirements for 
the administrative exemption if their pri-
mary duty includes work such as planning, 
scheduling, and coordinating activities re-
quired to develop systems to solve complex 
business, scientific or engineering problems 
of the employer or the employer’s customers. 
Similarly, a senior or lead computer pro-
grammer who manages the work of two or 
more other programmers in a customarily 
recognized department or subdivision of the 
employer, and whose recommendations as to 
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion 
or other change of status of the other pro-
grammers are given particular weight, gen-
erally meets the duties requirements for the 
executive exemption. 
øSUBPART F—OUTSIDE SALES EMPLOY-
EES (§§ 541.500–541.504) 
§ 541.500 General rule for outside sales em-
ployees. 
(a) The term ‘‘employee employed in the 
capacity of outside salesman’’ in section 
13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: 
(1) Whose primary duty is: 
(i) making sales within the meaning of sec-
tion 3(k) of the Act, or 
(ii) obtaining orders or contracts for serv-
ices or for the use of facilities for which a 
consideration will be paid by the client or 
customer; and 
(2) Who is customarily and regularly en-
gaged away from the employer’s place or 
places of business in performing such pri-
mary duty. 
(b) The term ‘‘primary duty’’ is defined at 
§ 541.700. In determining the primary duty of 
an outside sales employee, work performed 
incidental to and in conjunction with the 
employee’s own outside sales or solicita-
tions, including incidental deliveries and col-
lections, shall be regarded as exempt outside 
sales work. Other work that furthers the em-
ployee’s sales efforts also shall be regarded 
as exempt work including, for example, writ-
ing sales reports, updating or revising the 
employee’s sales or display catalogue, plan-
ning itineraries and attending sales con-
ferences. 
(c) The requirements of subpart G (salary 
requirements) of this part do not apply to 
the outside sales employees described in this 
section. 
§ 541.501 Making sales or obtaining orders. 
(a) Section 541.500 requires that the em-
ployee be engaged in: 
(1) Making sales within the meaning of sec-
tion 3(k) of the Act, or 
(2) Obtaining orders or contracts for serv-
ices or for the use of facilities. 
(b) Sales within the meaning of section 
3(k) of the Act include the transfer of title to 
tangible property, and in certain cases, of 
tangible and valuable evidences of intangible 
property. Section 3(k) of the Act states that 
‘‘sale’’ or ‘‘sell’’ includes any sale, exchange, 
contract to sell, consignment for sale, ship-
ment for sale, or other disposition. 
(c) Exempt outside sales work includes not 
only the sales of commodities, but also ‘‘ob-
taining orders or contracts for services or for 
the use of facilities for which a consideration 
will be paid by the client or customer.’’ Ob-
taining orders for ‘‘the use of facilities’’ in-
cludes the selling of time on radio or tele-
vision, the solicitation of advertising for 
newspapers and other periodicals, and the so-
licitation of freight for railroads and other 
transportation agencies. 
(d) The word ‘‘services’’ extends the out-
side sales exemption to employees who sell 
or take orders for a service, which may be 
performed for the customer by someone 
other than the person taking the order. 
§ 541.502 Away from employer’s place of busi-
ness. 
An outside sales employee must be custom-
arily and regularly engaged ‘‘away from the 
employer’s place or places of business.’’ The 
outside sales employee is an employee who 
makes sales at the customer’s place of busi-
ness or, if selling door-to-door, at the cus-
tomer’s home. Outside sales does not include 
sales made by mail, telephone or the Inter-
net unless such contact is used merely as an 
adjunct to personal calls. Thus, any fixed 
site, whether home or office, used by a sales-
person as a headquarters or for telephonic 
solicitation of sales is considered one of the 
employer’s places of business, even though 
the employer is not in any formal sense the 
owner or tenant of the property. However, an 
outside sales employee does not lose the ex-
emption by displaying samples in hotel sam-
ple rooms during trips from city to city; 
these sample rooms should not be considered 
as the employer’s places of business. Simi-
larly, an outside sales employee does not 
lose the exemption by displaying the em-
ployer’s products at a trade show. If selling 
actually occurs, rather than just sales pro-
motion, trade shows of short duration (i.e., 
one or two weeks) should not be considered 
as the employer’s place of business. 
§ 541.503 Promotion work. 
(a) Promotion work is one type of activity 
often performed by persons who make sales, 
which may or may not be exempt outside 
sales 
work, 
depending 
upon 
the 
cir-
cumstances under which it is performed. 
Promotional work that is actually performed 
incidental to and in conjunction with an em-
ployee’s own outside sales or solicitations is 
exempt work. On the other hand, pro-
motional work that is incidental to sales 
made, or to be made, by someone else is not 
exempt outside sales work. An employee who 
does not satisfy the requirements of this sub-
part may still qualify as an exempt em-
ployee under other subparts of this rule. 
(b) A manufacturer’s representative, for 
example, may perform various types of pro-
motional activities such as putting up dis-
plays and posters, removing damaged or 
spoiled stock from the merchant’s shelves or 
rearranging the merchandise. Such an em-
ployee can be considered an exempt outside 
sales employee if the employee’s primary 
duty is making sales or contracts. Pro-
motion 
activities 
directed 
toward 
con-
summation of the employee’s own sales are 
exempt. Promotional activities designed to 
stimulate sales that will be made by some-
one else are not exempt outside sales work. 
(c) Another example is a company rep-
resentative who visits chain stores, arranges 
the merchandise on shelves, replenishes 
stock by replacing old with new merchan-
dise, sets up displays and consults with the 
store manager when inventory runs low, but 
does not obtain a commitment for additional 
purchases. The arrangement of merchandise 
on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is 
not exempt work unless it is incidental to 
and in conjunction with the employee’s own 
outside sales. Because the employee in this 
instance does not consummate the sale nor 
direct efforts toward the consummation of a 
sale, the work is not exempt outside sales 
work.

sell such products may qualify as exempt

outside sales employees only if the employee 
has a primary duty of making sales. In deter-
mining the primary duty of drivers who sell, 
work performed incidental to and in conjunc-
tion with the employee’s own outside sales 
or solicitations, including loading, driving or 
delivering products, shall be regarded as ex-
empt outside sales work. 
(b) Several factors should be considered in 
determining if a driver has a primary duty of 
making sales, including, but not limited to: 
a comparison of the driver’s duties with 
those of other employees engaged as truck 
drivers and as salespersons; possession of a 
selling or solicitor’s license when such li-
cense is required by law or ordinances; pres-
ence or absence of customary or contractual 
arrangements concerning amounts of prod-
ucts to be delivered; description of the em-
ployee’s occupation in collective bargaining 
agreements; the employer’s specifications as 
to qualifications for hiring; sales training; 
attendance at sales conferences; method of 
payment; and proportion of earnings directly 
attributable to sales. 
(c) Drivers who may qualify as exempt out-
side sales employees include: 
(1) A driver who provides the only sales 
contact between the employer and the cus-
tomers visited, who calls on customers and 
takes orders for products, who delivers prod-
ucts from stock in the employee’s vehicle or 
procures and delivers the product to the cus-
tomer on a later trip, and who receives com-
pensation commensurate with the volume of 
products sold. 
(2) A driver who obtains or solicits orders 
for the employer’s products from persons 
who have authority to commit the customer 
for purchases. 
(3) A driver who calls on new prospects for 
customers along the employee’s route and 
attempts to convince them of the desir-
ability of accepting regular delivery of 
goods. 
(4) A driver who calls on established cus-
tomers along the route and persuades reg-
ular customers to accept delivery of in-
creased amounts of goods or of new products, 
even though the initial sale or agreement for 
delivery was made by someone else. 
(d) Drivers who generally would not qual-
ify as exempt outside sales employees in-
clude: 
(1) A route driver whose primary duty is to 
transport products sold by the employer 
through vending machines and to keep such 
machines stocked, in good operating condi-
tion, and in good locations. 
(2) A driver who often calls on established 
customers day after day or week after week, 
delivering a quantity of the employer’s prod-
ucts at each call when the sale was not sig-
nificantly affected by solicitations of the 
customer by the delivering driver or the 
amount of the sale is determined by the vol-
ume of the customer’s sales since the pre-
vious delivery. 
(3) A driver primarily engaged in making 
deliveries to customers and performing ac-
tivities intended to promote sales by cus-
tomers (including placing point-of-sale and 
other advertising materials, price stamping 
commodities, 
arranging 
merchandise 
on 
shelves, in coolers or in cabinets, rotating 
stock according to date, and cleaning and 
otherwise servicing display cases), unless 
such work is in furtherance of the driver’s 
own sales efforts.¿ 
SUBPART 
G—SALARY 
REQUIREMENTS 
(§§ 541.600–541.607) 
§ 541.600 Amount of salary required. 
(a) To qualify as an exempt executive, ad-
ministrative or professional employee under 
section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must 
be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of 
not less than $684 per week ø(or $455 per week 
if employed in the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto 
Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers 
other than the Federal Government, or $380 
per week if employed in American Samoa by 
employers other than the Federal Govern-
ment)¿, exclusive of board, lodging or other 
facilities. Administrative and professional 
employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as 
defined in § 541.605. 
(b) The required amount of compensation 
per week may be translated into equivalent 
amounts for periods longer than one week. 
For example, the $684-per-week requirement 
will be met if the employee is compensated 
biweekly on a salary basis of not less than 
$1,368, semimonthly on a salary basis of not 
less than $1,482, or monthly on a salary basis 
of not less than $2,964. However, the shortest 
period of payment that will meet this com-
pensation requirement is one week. 
(c) In the case of academic administrative 
employees, the compensation requirement 
also may be met by compensation on a sal-
ary basis at a rate at least equal to the en-
trance salary for teachers in the educational 
establishment by which the employee is em-
ployed, as provided in § 541.204(a)(1). 
(d) In the case of computer employees, the 
compensation requirement also may be met 
by compensation on an hourly basis at a rate 
not less than $27.63 an hour, as provided in 
§ 541.400(b). 
(e) In the case of professional employees, 
the compensation requirements in this sec-
tion shall not apply to employees engaged as 
teachers (see § 541.303); employees who hold a 
valid license or certificate permitting the 
practice of law or medicine or any of their 
branches and are actually engaged in the 
practice thereof (see § 541.304); or to employ-
ees who hold the requisite academic degree 
for the general practice of medicine and are 
engaged in an internship or resident program 
pursuant to the practice of the profession 
(see § 541.304). In the case of medical occupa-
tions, the exception from the salary or fee 
requirement does not apply to pharmacists, 
nurses, 
therapists, 
technologists, 
sanitarians, dietitians, social workers, psy-
chologists, psychometrists, or other profes-
sions which service the medical profession. 
SUBPART 
H—DEFINITIONS 
AND 
MIS-
CELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (§§ 541.700– 
541.710) 
§ 541.601 Highly compensated employees. 
(a)(1) Beginning on January 1, 2020, an em-
ployee with total annual compensation of at 
least $107,432 is deemed exempt under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act if the employee custom-
arily and regularly performs any one or more 
of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an 
executive, administrative or professional 
employee as identified in subparts B, C or D 
of this part. 
(2) Where the annual period covers periods 
both prior to and after January 1, 2020, the 
amount of total annual compensation due 
will be determined on a proportional basis. 
(b)(1) ‘‘Total annual compensation’’ must 
include at least $684 per week paid on a sal-
ary or fee basis as set forth in §§ 541.602 and 
541.605, except that § 541.602(a)(3) shall not 
apply to highly compensated employees. 
Total annual compensation may also include 
commissions, nondiscretionary bonuses and 
other nondiscretionary compensation earned 
during a 52-week period. Total annual com-
pensation does not include board, lodging 
and other facilities as defined in § 541.606, and 
does not include payments for medical insur-
ance, payments for life insurance, contribu-
tions to retirement plans and the cost of 
other fringe benefits. 
(2) If an employee’s total annual com-
pensation does not total at least the amount 
specified in the applicable subsection of 
paragraph (a) by the last pay period of the 
52-week period, the employer may, during 
the last pay period or within one month 
after the end of the 52-week period, make one 
final payment sufficient to achieve the re-
quired level. For example, for a 52-week pe-
riod beginning January 1, 2020, an employee 
may earn $90,000 in base salary, and the em-
ployer may anticipate based upon past sales 
that the employee also will earn $17,432 in 
commissions. However, due to poor sales in 
the final quarter of the year, the employee 
actually only earns $12,000 in commissions. 
In this situation, the employer may within 
one month after the end of the year make a 
payment of at least $5,432 to the employee. 
Any such final payment made after the end 
of the 52-week period may count only toward 
the prior year’s total annual compensation 
and not toward the total annual compensa-
tion in the year it was paid. If the employer 
fails to make such a payment, the employee 
does not qualify as a highly compensated 
employee, but may still qualify as exempt 
under subparts B, C, or D of this part. 
(3) An employee who does not work a full 
year for the employer, either because the 
employee is newly hired after the beginning 
of the year or ends the employment before 
the end of the year, may qualify for exemp-
tion under this section if the employee re-
ceives a pro rata portion of the minimum 
amount established in paragraph (a) of this 
section, based upon the number of weeks 
that the employee will be or has been em-
ployed. An employer may make one final 
payment as under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section within one month after the end of 
employment. 
(4) The employer may utilize any 52-week 
period as the year, such as a calendar year, 
a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. 
If the employer does not identify some other 
year period in advance, the calendar year 
will apply. 
(c) A high level of compensation is a strong 
indicator of an employee’s exempt status, 
thus eliminating the need for a detailed 
analysis of the employee’s job duties. Thus, 
a highly compensated employee will qualify 
for exemption if the employee customarily 
and regularly performs any one or more of 
the exempt duties or responsibilities of an 
executive, administrative or professional 
employee identified in subparts B, C or D of 
this part. An employee may qualify as a 
highly compensated executive employee, for 
example, if the employee customarily and 
regularly directs the work of two or more 
other employees, even though the employee 
does not meet all of the other requirements 
for the executive exemption under § 541.100. 
(d) This section applies only to employees 
whose primary duty includes performing of-
fice or non-manual work. Thus, for example, 
non-management 
production-line 
workers 
and non-management employees in mainte-
nance, construction and similar occupations 
such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, 
plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating 
engineers, longshoremen, construction work-
ers, laborers and other employees who per-
form work involving repetitive operations 
with their hands, physical skill and energy 
are not exempt under this section no matter 
how highly paid they might be. 
§ 541.602 Salary basis. 
(a) General rule. An employee will be con-
sidered to be paid on a ‘‘salary basis’’ within 
the meaning of this part if the employee reg-
ularly receives each pay period on a weekly, 
or less frequent basis, a predetermined 
amount constituting all or part of the em-
ployee’s compensation, which amount is not 
subject to reduction because of variations in 
the quality or quantity of the work per-
formed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2167 
April 26, 2022 
(1) Subject to the exceptions provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, an exempt em-
ployee must receive the full salary for any 
week in which the employee performs any 
work without regard to the number of days 
or hours worked. Exempt employees need not 
be paid for any workweek in which they per-
form no work. 
(2) An employee is not paid on a salary 
basis if deductions from the employee’s pre-
determined compensation are made for ab-
sences occasioned by the employer or by the 
operating requirements of the business. If 
the employee is ready, willing and able to 
work, deductions may not be made for time 
when work is not available. 
(3) Up to ten percent of the salary amount 
required by § 541.600(a) may be satisfied by 
the payment of nondiscretionary bonuses, in-
centives and commissions, that are paid an-
nually or more frequently. The employer 
may utilize any 52-week period as the year, 
such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an 
anniversary of hire year. If the employer 
does not identify some other year period in 
advance, the calendar year will apply. This 
provision does not apply to highly com-
pensated employees under § 541.601. 
(i) If by the last pay period of the 52-week 
period the sum of the employee’s weekly sal-
ary plus nondiscretionary bonus, incentive, 
and commission payments received is less 
than 52 times the weekly salary amount re-
quired by § 541.600(a), the employer may 
make one final payment sufficient to achieve 
the required level no later than the next pay 
period after the end of the year. Any such 
final payment made after the end of the 52– 
week period may count only toward the prior 
year’s salary amount and not toward the sal-
ary amount in the year it was paid. 
(ii) An employee who does not work a full 
52-week period for the employer, either be-
cause the employee is newly hired after the 
beginning of this period or ends the employ-
ment before the end of this period, may qual-
ify for exemption if the employee receives a 
pro rata portion of the minimum amount es-
tablished in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
based upon the number of weeks that the 
employee will be or has been employed. An 
employer may make one final payment as 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section with-
in one pay period after the end of employ-
ment. 
(b) Exceptions. The prohibition against de-
ductions from pay in the salary basis re-
quirement is subject to the following excep-
tions: 
(1) Deductions from pay may be made when 
an exempt employee is absent from work for 
one or more full days for personal reasons, 
other than sickness or disability. Thus, if an 
employee is absent for two full days to han-
dle personal affairs, the employee’s salaried 
status will not be affected if deductions are 
made from the salary for two full-day ab-
sences. However, if an exempt employee is 
absent for one and a half days for personal 
reasons, the employer can deduct only for 
the one full-day absence. 
(2) Deductions from pay may be made for 
absences of one or more full days occasioned 
by sickness or disability (including work-re-
lated accidents) if the deduction is made in 
accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or 
practice of providing compensation for loss 
of salary occasioned by such sickness or dis-
ability. The employer is not required to pay 
any portion of the employee’s salary for full- 
day absences for which the employee re-
ceives compensation under the plan, policy 
or practice. Deductions for such full-day ab-
sences also may be made before the em-
ployee has qualified under the plan, policy or 
practice, and after the employee has ex-
hausted the leave allowance thereunder. 
Thus, for example, if an employer maintains 
a short-term disability insurance plan pro-
viding salary replacement for 12 weeks start-
ing on the fourth day of absence, the em-
ployer may make deductions from pay for 
the three days of absence before the em-
ployee qualifies for benefits under the plan; 
for the twelve weeks in which the employee 
receives salary replacement benefits under 
the plan; and for absences after the employee 
has exhausted the 12 weeks of salary replace-
ment benefits. Similarly, an employer may 
make deductions from pay for absences of 
one or more full days if salary replacement 
benefits are provided under a State dis-
ability insurance law or under a State work-
ers’ compensation law. 
(3) While an employer cannot make deduc-
tions from pay for absences of an exempt em-
ployee occasioned by jury duty, attendance 
as a witness or temporary military leave, the 
employer can offset any amounts received by 
an employee as jury fees, witness fees or 
military pay for a particular week against 
the salary due for that particular week with-
out loss of the exemption. 
(4) Deductions from pay of exempt employ-
ees may be made for penalties imposed in 
good faith for infractions of safety rules of 
major significance. Safety rules of major sig-
nificance include those relating to the pre-
vention of serious danger in the workplace or 
to other employees, such as rules prohibiting 
smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries 
and coal mines. 
(5) Deductions from pay of exempt employ-
ees may be made for unpaid disciplinary sus-
pensions of one or more full days imposed in 
good faith for infractions of workplace con-
duct rules. Such suspensions must be im-
posed pursuant to a written policy applicable 
to all employees. Thus, for example, an em-
ployer may suspend an exempt employee 
without pay for three days for violating a 
generally applicable written policy prohib-
iting sexual harassment. Similarly, an em-
ployer may suspend an exempt employee 
without pay for twelve days for violating a 
generally applicable written policy prohib-
iting workplace violence. 
(6) An employer is not required to pay the 
full salary in the initial or terminal week of 
employment. Rather, an employer may pay a 
proportionate part of an employee’s full sal-
ary for the time actually worked in the first 
and last week of employment. In such weeks, 
the payment of an hourly or daily equivalent 
of the employee’s full salary for the time ac-
tually worked will meet the requirement. 
However, employees are not paid on a salary 
basis within the meaning of these regula-
tions if they are employed occasionally for a 
few days, and the employer pays them a pro-
portionate part of the weekly salary when so 
employed. 
(7) An employer is not required to pay the 
full salary for weeks in which an exempt em-
ployee takes unpaid leave under the Family 
and Medical Leave Act. Rather, when an ex-
empt employee takes unpaid leave under the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer 
may pay a proportionate part of the full sal-
ary for time actually worked. For example, 
if an employee who normally works 40 hours 
per week uses four hours of unpaid leave 
under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
the employer could deduct 10 percent of the 
employee’s normal salary that week. 
(c) When calculating the amount of a de-
duction from pay allowed under paragraph 
(b) of this section, the employer may use the 
hourly or daily equivalent of the employee’s 
full weekly salary or any other amount pro-
portional to the time actually missed by the 
employee. A deduction from pay as a penalty 
for violations of major safety rules under 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be made 
in any amount. 
§ 541.603 Effect of improper deductions from 
salary. 
(a) An employer who makes improper de-
ductions from salary shall lose the exemp-
tion if the facts demonstrate that the em-
ployer did not intend to pay employees on a 
salary basis. An actual practice of making 
improper deductions demonstrates that the 
employer did not intend to pay employees on 
a salary basis. The factors to consider when 
determining whether an employer has an ac-
tual practice of making improper deductions 
include, but are not limited to: the number 
of improper deductions, particularly as com-
pared to the number of employee infractions 
warranting discipline; the time period during 
which the employer made improper deduc-
tions; the number and geographic location of 
employees whose salary was improperly re-
duced; the number and geographic location 
of managers responsible for taking the im-
proper deductions; and whether the employer 
has a clearly communicated policy permit-
ting or prohibiting improper deductions. 
(b) If the facts demonstrate that the em-
ployer has an actual practice of making im-
proper deductions, the exemption is lost dur-
ing the time period in which the improper 
deductions were made for employees in the 
same job classification working for the same 
managers responsible for the actual im-
proper deductions. Employees in different 
job classifications or who work for different 
managers do not lose their status as exempt 
employees. Thus, for example, if a manager 
at a company facility routinely docks the 
pay of engineers at that facility for partial- 
day personal absences, then all engineers at 
that facility whose pay could have been im-
properly docked by the manager would lose 
the exemption; engineers at other facilities 
or working for other managers, however, 
would remain exempt. 
(c) Improper deductions that are either iso-
lated or inadvertent will not result in loss of 
the exemption for any employees subject to 
such improper deductions, if the employer 
reimburses the employees for such improper 
deductions. 
(d) If an employer has a clearly commu-
nicated policy that prohibits the improper 
pay deductions specified in § 541.602(a) and in-
cludes a complaint mechanism, reimburses 
employees for any improper deductions and 
makes a good faith commitment to comply 
in the future, such employer will not lose the 
exemption for any employees unless the em-
ployer willfully violates the policy by con-
tinuing to make improper deductions after 
receiving employee complaints. If an em-
ployer fails to reimburse employees for any 
improper deductions or continues to make 
improper deductions after receiving em-
ployee complaints, the exemption is lost dur-
ing the time period in which the improper 
deductions were made for employees in the 
same job classification working for the same 
managers responsible for the actual im-
proper deductions. The best evidence of a 
clearly communicated policy is a written 
policy that was distributed to employees 
prior to the improper pay deductions by, for 
example, providing a copy of the policy to 
employees at the time of hire, publishing the 
policy in an employee handbook or pub-
lishing 
the 
policy 
on 
the 
employer’s 
Intranet. 
(e) This section shall not be construed in 
an unduly technical manner so as to defeat 
the exemption. 
§ 541.604 Minimum guarantee plus extras. 
(a) An employer may provide an exempt 
employee 
with 
additional 
compensation 
without losing the exemption or violating 
the salary basis requirement, if the employ-
ment arrangement also includes a guarantee 
of at least the minimum weekly-required

amount paid on a salary basis. Thus, for ex-
ample, an exempt employee guaranteed at 
least $684 each week paid on a salary basis 
may also receive additional compensation of 
a one percent commission on sales. An ex-
empt employee also may receive a percent-
age of the sales or profits of the employer if 
the employment arrangement also includes a 
guarantee of at least $684 each week paid on 
a salary basis. Similarly, the exemption is 
not lost if an exempt employee who is guar-
anteed at least $684 each week paid on a sal-
ary basis also receives additional compensa-
tion based on hours worked for work beyond 
the normal workweek. Such additional com-
pensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., flat 
sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly 
amount, time and one-half or any other 
basis), and may include paid time off. 
(b) An exempt employee’s earnings may be 
computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift 
basis, without losing the exemption or vio-
lating the salary basis requirement, if the 
employment arrangement also includes a 
guarantee of at least the minimum weekly 
required amount paid on a salary basis re-
gardless of the number of hours, days or 
shifts worked, and a reasonable relationship 
exists between the guaranteed amount and 
the amount actually earned. The reasonable 
relationship test will be met if the weekly 
guarantee is roughly equivalent to the em-
ployee’s usual earnings at the assigned hour-
ly, daily or shift rate for the employee’s nor-
mal scheduled workweek. Thus, for example, 
an exempt employee guaranteed compensa-
tion of at least $725 for any week in which 
the employee performs any work, and who 
normally works four or five shifts each week, 
may be paid $210 per shift without violating 
the $684-per-week salary basis requirement. 
The reasonable relationship requirement ap-
plies only if the employee’s pay is computed 
on an hourly, daily or shift basis. It does not 
apply, for example, to an exempt store man-
ager paid a guaranteed salary per week that 
exceeds the current salary level who also re-
ceives a commission of one-half percent of 
all sales in the store or five percent of the 
store’s profits, which in some weeks may 
total as much as, or even more than, the 
guaranteed salary. 
§ 541.605 Fee basis. 
(a) Administrative and professional em-
ployees may be paid on a fee basis, rather 
than on a salary basis. An employee will be 
considered to be paid on a ‘‘fee basis’’ within 
the meaning of these regulations if the em-
ployee is paid an agreed sum for a single job 
regardless of the time required for its com-
pletion. These payments resemble piecework 
payments with the important distinction 
that generally a ‘‘fee’’ is paid for the kind of 
job that is unique rather than for a series of 
jobs repeated an indefinite number of times 
and for which payment on an identical basis 
is made over and over again. Payments based 
on the number of hours or days worked and 
not on the accomplishment of a given single 
task are not considered payments on a fee 
basis. 
(b) To determine whether the fee payment 
meets the minimum amount of salary re-
quired for exemption under these regula-
tions, the amount paid to the employee will 
be tested by determining the time worked on 
the job and whether the fee payment is at a 
rate that would amount to at least the min-
imum salary per week, as required by 
§§ 541.600(a) and 541.602(a), if the employee 
worked 40 hours. Thus, an artist paid $350 for 
a picture that took 20 hours to complete 
meets the $684 minimum salary requirement 
for exemption since earnings at this rate 
would yield the artist $700 if 40 hours were 
worked. 
§ 541.606 Board, lodging or other facilities. 
(a) To qualify for exemption under section 
13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must earn 
the minimum salary amount set forth in 
§ 541.600, ‘‘exclusive of board, lodging or other 
facilities.’’ The phrase ‘‘exclusive of board, 
lodging or other facilities’’ means ‘‘free and 
clear’’ or independent of any claimed credit 
for non-cash items of value that an employer 
may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs 
incurred by an employer to provide an em-
ployee with board, lodging or other facilities 
may not count towards the minimum salary 
amount required for exemption under this 
part 541. Such separate transactions are not 
prohibited between employers and their ex-
empt employees, but the costs to employers 
associated with such transactions may not 
be considered when determining if an em-
ployee has received the full required min-
imum salary payment. 
(b) Regulations defining what constitutes 
‘‘board, lodging, or other facilities’’ are con-
tained in 29 CFR part 531 <<which are incor-
porated herein>>. øAs described in 29 CFR 
531.32, the term ‘‘other facilities’’ refers to 
items similar to board and lodging, such as 
meals furnished at company restaurants or 
cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or res-
taurants to their employees; meals, dor-
mitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a 
college to its student employees; merchan-
dise furnished at company stores or com-
missaries, including articles of food, cloth-
ing, and household effects; housing furnished 
for dwelling purposes; and transportation 
furnished to employees for ordinary com-
muting between their homes and work.¿ 
ø§ 541.607¿ øReserved by 85 FR 34970 Effec-
tive: June 8, 2020¿ 
§ 541.700 Primary duty. 
(a) To qualify for exemption under this 
part, an employee’s ‘‘primary duty’’ must be 
the performance of exempt work. The term 
‘‘primary duty’’ means the principal, main, 
major or most important duty that the em-
ployee performs. Determination of an em-
ployee’s primary duty must be based on all 
the facts in a particular case, with the major 
emphasis on the character of the employee’s 
job as a whole. Factors to consider when de-
termining the primary duty of an employee 
include, but are not limited to, the relative 
importance of the exempt duties as com-
pared with other types of duties; the amount 
of time spent performing exempt work; the 
employee’s relative freedom from direct su-
pervision; and the relationship between the 
employee’s salary and the wages paid to 
other employees for the kind of nonexempt 
work performed by the employee. 
(b) The amount of time spent performing 
exempt work can be a useful guide in deter-
mining whether exempt work is the primary 
duty of an employee. Thus, employees who 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt work will generally satisfy 
the primary duty requirement. Time alone, 
however, is not the sole test, and nothing in 
this section requires that exempt employees 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt work. Employees who do not 
spend more than 50 percent of their time per-
forming exempt duties may nonetheless 
meet the primary duty requirement if the 
other factors support such a conclusion. 
(c) Thus, for example, assistant managers 
in a retail establishment who perform ex-
empt executive work such as supervising and 
directing the work of other employees, or-
dering merchandise, managing the budget 
and authorizing payment of bills may have 
management as their primary duty even if 
the assistant managers spend more than 50 
percent of the time performing nonexempt 
work such as running the cash register. How-
ever, if such assistant managers are closely 
supervised and earn little more than the 
nonexempt employees, the assistant man-
agers generally would not satisfy the pri-
mary duty requirement. 
§ 541.701 Customarily and regularly. 
The phrase ‘‘customarily and regularly’’ 
means a frequency that must be greater than 
occasional but which, of course, may be less 
than constant. Tasks or work performed 
‘‘customarily and regularly’’ includes work 
normally and recurrently performed every 
workweek; it does not include isolated or 
one-time tasks. 
§ 541.702 Exempt and nonexempt work. 
The term ‘‘exempt work’’ means all work 
described in §§ 541.100, 541.101, 541.200, 541.300, 
541.301, 
541.302, 
541.303, 
541.304, 
<<and>> 
541.400 øand 541.500¿, and the activities di-
rectly and closely related to such work. All 
other work is considered ‘‘nonexempt.’’ 
§ 541.703 Directly and closely related. 
(a) Work that is ‘‘directly and closely re-
lated’’ to the performance of exempt work is 
also considered exempt work. The phrase 
‘‘directly and closely related’’ means tasks 
that are related to exempt duties and that 
contribute to or facilitate performance of ex-
empt work. Thus, ‘‘directly and closely re-
lated’’ work may include physical tasks and 
menial tasks that arise out of exempt duties, 
and the routine work without which the ex-
empt employee’s exempt work cannot be per-
formed properly. Work ‘‘directly and closely 
related’’ to the performance of exempt duties 
may also include recordkeeping; monitoring 
and adjusting machinery; taking notes; 
using the computer to create documents or 
presentations; opening the mail for the pur-
pose of reading it and making decisions; and 
using a photocopier or fax machine. Work is 
not ‘‘directly and closely related’’ if the 
work is remotely related or completely unre-
lated to exempt duties. 
(b) The following examples further illus-
trate the type of work that is and is not nor-
mally considered as directly and closely re-
lated to exempt work: 
(1) Keeping time, production or sales 
records for subordinates is work directly and 
closely related to an exempt executive’s 
function of managing a department and su-
pervising employees. 
(2) The distribution of materials, merchan-
dise or supplies to maintain control of the 
flow of and expenditures for such items is di-
rectly and closely related to the performance 
of exempt duties. 
(3) A supervisor who spot checks and exam-
ines the work of subordinates to determine 
whether they are performing their duties 
properly, and whether the product is satis-
factory, is performing work which is directly 
and closely related to managerial and super-
visory functions, so long as the checking is 
distinguishable from the work ordinarily 
performed by a nonexempt inspector. 
(4) A supervisor who sets up a machine 
may be engaged in exempt work, depending 
upon the nature of the industry and the oper-
ation. In some cases the setup work, or ad-
justment of the machine for a particular job, 
is typically performed by the same employ-
ees who operate the machine. Such setup 
work is part of the production operation and 
is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up 
of the work is a highly skilled operation 
which the ordinary production worker or 
machine tender typically does not perform. 
In large plants, non-supervisors may perform 
such work. However, particularly in small 
plants, such work may be a regular duty of 
the executive and is directly and closely re-
lated to the executive’s responsibility for the 
work performance of subordinates and for 
the adequacy of the final product. Under 
such circumstances, it is exempt work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2169 
April 26, 2022 
(5) A department manager in a retail or 
service establishment who walks about the 
sales floor observing the work of sales per-
sonnel under the employee’s supervision to 
determine the effectiveness of their sales 
techniques, checks on the quality of cus-
tomer service being given, or observes cus-
tomer preferences is performing work which 
is directly and closely related to managerial 
and supervisory functions. 
(6) A business consultant may take exten-
sive notes recording the flow of work and 
materials through the office or plant of the 
client; after returning to the office of the 
employer, the consultant may personally use 
the computer to type a report and create a 
proposed table of organization. Standing 
alone, or separated from the primary duty, 
such note-taking and typing would be rou-
tine in nature. However, because this work is 
necessary for analyzing the data and making 
recommendations, the work is directly and 
closely related to exempt work. While it is 
possible to assign note-taking and typing to 
nonexempt employees, and in fact it is fre-
quently the practice to do so, delegating 
such routine tasks is not required as a condi-
tion of exemption. 
(7) A credit manager who makes and ad-
ministers the credit policy of the employer, 
establishes credit limits for customers, au-
thorizes the shipment of orders on credit, 
and makes decisions on whether to exceed 
credit limits would be performing work ex-
empt under § 541.200. Work that is directly 
and closely related to these exempt duties 
may include checking the status of accounts 
to determine whether the credit limit would 
be exceeded by the shipment of a new order, 
removing credit reports from the files for 
analysis, and writing letters giving credit 
data and experience to other employers or 
credit agencies. 
(8) A traffic manager in charge of planning 
a company’s transportation, including the 
most economical and quickest routes for 
shipping merchandise to and from the plant, 
contracting for common-carrier and other 
transportation facilities, negotiating with 
carriers for adjustments for damages to mer-
chandise, and making the necessary re-
arrangements resulting from delays, dam-
ages or irregularities in transit, is per-
forming exempt work. If the employee also 
spends part of the day taking telephone or-
ders for local deliveries, such order-taking is 
a routine function and is not directly and 
closely related to the exempt work. 
(9) An example of work directly and closely 
related to exempt professional duties is a 
chemist performing menial tasks such as 
cleaning a test tube in the middle of an 
original experiment, even though such me-
nial tasks can be assigned to laboratory as-
sistants. 
(10) A teacher performs work directly and 
closely related to exempt duties when, while 
taking students on a field trip, the teacher 
drives a school van or monitors the students’ 
behavior in a restaurant. 
§ 541.704 Use of manuals. 
The use of manuals, guidelines or other es-
tablished procedures containing or relating 
to highly technical, scientific, legal, finan-
cial or other similarly complex matters that 
can be understood or interpreted only by 
those with advanced or specialized knowl-
edge or skills does not preclude exemption 
under section 13(a)(1) of the Act or the regu-
lations in this part. Such manuals and proce-
dures provide guidance in addressing dif-
ficult or novel circumstances and thus use of 
such reference material would not affect an 
employee’s 
exempt 
status. 
The 
section 
13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, how-
ever, for employees who simply apply well- 
established techniques or procedures de-
scribed in manuals or other sources within 
closely prescribed limits to determine the 
correct response to an inquiry or set of cir-
cumstances. 
§ 541.705 Trainees. 
The 
executive, 
administrative, 
profes-
sional, øoutside sales¿ and computer em-
ployee exemptions do not apply to employees 
training for employment in an executive, ad-
ministrative, professional, øoutside sales¿ or 
computer employee capacity who are not ac-
tually performing the duties of an executive, 
administrative, professional, øoutside sales¿ 
or computer employee. 
§ 541.706 Emergencies. 
(a) An exempt employee will not lose the 
exemption by performing work of a normally 
nonexempt nature because of the existence 
of an emergency. Thus, when emergencies 
arise that threaten the safety of employees, 
a cessation of operations or serious damage 
to the employer’s property, any work per-
formed in an effort to prevent such results is 
considered exempt work. 
(b) An ‘‘emergency’’ does not include oc-
currences that are not beyond control or for 
which the employer can reasonably provide 
in the normal course of business. Emer-
gencies generally occur only rarely, and are 
events that the employer cannot reasonably 
anticipate. 
(c) The following examples illustrate the 
distinction between emergency work consid-
ered exempt work and routine work that is 
not exempt work: 
(1) A mine superintendent who pitches in 
after an explosion and digs out workers who 
are trapped in the mine is still a bona fide 
executive. 
(2) Assisting nonexempt employees with 
their work during periods of heavy workload 
or to handle rush orders is not exempt work. 
(3) Replacing a nonexempt employee dur-
ing the first day or partial day of an illness 
may be considered exempt emergency work 
depending on factors such as the size of the 
establishment and of the executive’s depart-
ment, the nature of the industry, the con-
sequences that would flow from the failure 
to replace the ailing employee immediately, 
and the feasibility of filling the employee’s 
place promptly. 
(4) Regular repair and cleaning of equip-
ment is not emergency work, even when nec-
essary to prevent fire or explosion; however, 
repairing equipment may be emergency work 
if the breakdown of or damage to the equip-
ment was caused by accident or carelessness 
that the employer could not reasonably an-
ticipate. 
§ 541.707 Occasional tasks. 
Occasional, infrequently recurring tasks 
that cannot practicably be performed by 
nonexempt employees, but are the means for 
an exempt employee to properly carry out 
exempt functions and responsibilities, are 
considered exempt work. The following fac-
tors should be considered in determining 
whether such work is exempt work: Whether 
the same work is performed by any of the ex-
empt employee’s subordinates; practicability 
of delegating the work to a nonexempt em-
ployee; whether the exempt employee per-
forms the task frequently or occasionally; 
and existence of an industry practice for the 
exempt employee to perform the task. 
§ 541.708 Combination exemptions. 
Employees who perform a combination of 
exempt duties as set forth in the regulations 
in this part for executive, administrative, 
professional, øoutside sales¿ and computer 
employees may qualify for exemption. Thus, 
for example, an employee whose primary 
duty involves a combination of exempt ad-
ministrative and exempt executive work 
may qualify for exemption. In other words, 
work that is exempt under one section of 
this part will not defeat the exemption under 
any other section. 
ø§ 541.709 Motion picture producing industry. 
The requirement that the employee be paid 
‘‘on a salary basis’’ does not apply to an em-
ployee in the motion picture producing in-
dustry who is compensated at a base rate of 
at least $1,043 per week (exclusive of board, 
lodging, or other facilities). Thus, an em-
ployee in this industry who is otherwise ex-
empt under subparts B, C, or D of this part, 
and who is employed at a base rate of at 
least 
the 
applicable 
current 
minimum 
amount a week is exempt if paid a propor-
tionate amount (based on a week of not more 
than 6 days) for any week in which the em-
ployee does not work a full workweek for 
any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt 
employee in this industry qualifies for ex-
emption if the employee is employed at a 
daily 
rate 
under 
the 
following 
cir-
cumstances: 
(a) The employee is in a job category for 
which a weekly base rate is not provided and 
the daily base rate would yield at least the 
minimum weekly amount if 6 days were 
worked; or 
(b) The employee is in a job category hav-
ing the minimum weekly base rate and the 
daily base rate is at least one-sixth of such 
weekly base rate.¿ 
§ 541.710 Employees of public agencies. 
(a) An employee of a public agency who 
otherwise meets the salary basis require-
ments of § 541.602 shall not be disqualified 
from 
exemption 
under 
§§ 541.100, 541.200, 
541.300 or 541.400 on the basis that such em-
ployee is paid according to a pay system es-
tablished by statute, ordinance or regula-
tion, or by a policy or practice established 
pursuant to principles of public account-
ability, under which the employee accrues 
personal leave and sick leave and which re-
quires the public agency employee’s pay to 
be reduced or such employee to be placed on 
leave without pay for absences for personal 
reasons or because of illness or injury of less 
than one work-day when accrued leave is not 
used by an employee because: 
(1) Permission for its use has not been 
sought or has been sought and denied; 
(2) Accrued leave has been exhausted; or 
(3) The employee chooses to use leave with-
out pay. 
(b) Deductions from the pay of an em-
ployee of a public agency for absences due to 
a budget-required furlough shall not dis-
qualify the employee from being paid on a 
salary basis except in the workweek in which 
the furlough occurs and for which the em-
ployee’s pay is accordingly reduced.

HONORING 
THE 
200TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BIRTH OF FRED-
ERICK LAW OLMSTED 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, April 26, 2022, 
marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of 
Frederick Law Olmsted. 
Over a lengthy career, Olmsted was an au-
thor, journalist, public official, city planner, 
landscape architect, and creative genius who 
transformed the American landscape. 
Olmsted’s philosophy and designs influ-
enced the development of beautiful and func-
tional landscapes, including parks and park-
ways, college campuses, planned commu-
nities, estates, cemeteries, recreation areas, 
and specialized landscapes for arboreta and 
expositions 
including, 
the 
U.S. 
Capitol 
grounds, New York City’s Central Park, Yo-
semite Valley, Hot Springs National Park, and 
Stanford University. 
Olmsted is remembered as the premier 
landscape architect in the United States during 
the 19th century and is considered to be the 
founder of landscape architecture in the 
United States. He was also one of the first in-
dividuals to promote the idea of national parks 
in his 1865 Yosemite Report. 
Olmsted believed that thoughtful landscape 
designs should promote community, advance 
democracy, provide recreational opportunities 
in urban environments, nurture and invigorate 
public health, and encourage the development 
of livable communities. 
Olmsted’s associates, sons, and successor 
firms carried out his philosophy and designs 
well into the 20th century, leaving a tremen-
dous legacy of historic landscapes that con-
tinues to benefit the people of the United 
States and visitors throughout the world. 
Olmsted inspired the development of large 
parks and park systems for public benefit in 
urban areas, creating a legacy of parks that 
are a singular feature of the urban experience. 
Olmsted’s landscape designs play a vital 
role in the enrichment of quality of life in hun-
dreds of communities across the United States 
who are celebrating this bicentennial anniver-
sary as part of a coordinated national and 
local celebration. 
I commend this occasion and celebrate the 
200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick Law 
Olmsted.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF J. 
DARREN STEWART 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the distin-
guished service of Chief Darren Stewart of 
Pawcatuck, Connecticut. As the Chief of Po-
lice in Stonington, Stewart led an esteemed 
career that spanned over 38 years since he 
joined the force at the age of 19. In leading 
the division for the last 14 years, Chief Stew-
art has embodied the spirit of a perfect role 
model and leader—one that I am sure that fu-
ture chiefs, not just in Stonington but also 
across the entire district, will look to in praise 
and admiration. 
ln addition to serving in the police depart-
ment, Stewart also pursued a passion for 
learning and teaching. In 2000, he earned a 
Bachelor of General Studies from the Univer-
sity of Connecticut in Storrs and continued his 
studies at Salve Regina University of Rhode 
Island to earn his Master of Business Adminis-
tration in Management. Armed with these de-
grees and a passion for helping others grow, 
Darren began a secondary career as a pro-
fessor for his alma maters and the Con-
necticut State Police Academy in 2004. Since 
his first day as a professor, Stewart has 
proved a patient and wise teacher committed 
to educating future community members. 
Chief Stewart’s dual-path as an educator 
and community leader proved to make him a 
natural, steady-handed Chief of the Stonington 
Police Department. Passionate about the pro-
tection of his local community, Stewart’s dedi-
cation and impressive work ethic earned him 
the promotion of Chief of Police in 2008. As 
someone whose career originated with the 
force, he came into the role with a clear un-
derstanding of the greatest opportunities for 
improvement. It was with this background in 
mind that prioritizing an efficient and resource- 
rich workforce became the first, second and 
third priority. 
One-by-one, Chief Stewart marked off his 
checklist of goals for the force, equipping his 
officers with the tools that they needed to suc-
ceed. This included updating mechanical sys-
tems and computer technology, acquiring a 
new police boat, and creating a chaplain pro-
gram to assist his officers with the toughest 
part of the job—notifying immediate family of 
the tragic loss of one of their colleagues. No-
tably, it was also with much thanks to Chief 
Stewart’s efforts that Stonington led the move-
ment to invest in local communications infra-
structure and tie the agency into the state’s 
superior radio system. As a result of Chief 
Stewart’s initiative and the town’s major up-
grade in terms of safe and efficient commu-
nication, Stonington earned the 2018 Munic-
ipal Excellence Award from the Connecticut 
Conference of Municipalities. With Chief Stew-
art at the helm, the Stonington Police Depart-
ment also entered a parentship with Safe Fu-
tures, a social services agency based in near-
by New London, Connecticut, which now sup-
ports the town in assisting victims of domestic 
violence. My office has worked with the 
Stonington Police Department to obtain federal 
competitive grant funding in the past and I can 
personally attest that the department would 
not be nearly as well equipped and successful 
as it is today without Chief Stewart’s hard 
work and advocacy for his fellow officers. 
Madam Speaker, I am so proud to represent 
such selfless and committed constituents as 
Darren Stewart in the second district of Con-
necticut. Inspired by his wife, Beth, three 
daughters, and the difference made by his 
own colleagues, Chief Stewart set out to en-
sure the Stonington Police Department worked 
for their partners: the People of Stonington. 
Though his transition into his new role un-
doubtedly leaves large shoes to fill, we find 
gratitude in the fact that he has left the depart-
ment in incredible standing, in capable hands, 
and that Chief Stewart will remain an active 
member of the local community. To that end, 
as he embarks on this next chapter with his 
family, I ask my colleagues in the House to 
join me in honoring Chief J. Darren Stewart, 
an inspiring leader and impeccable role model, 
for his huge successes in the police depart-
ment and impact on the countless lives of oth-
ers, extending the legacy of his career.

HONORING THE CAREER OF CHRIS 
WILDER 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Chris Wilder who is retiring 
after 18 years as the President and Executive 
Director of the Valley Medical Center Founda-
tion. His impact and contributions can be seen 
throughout our community. 
In 2004, Chris Wilder joined the Valley Med-
ical Center Foundation, which is the nonprofit 
organization that acts as the community fund-
raising arm for Santa Clara County Valley 
Medical Center. This center provides care to 1 
in 4 valley residents and is home to San 
Jose’s only top-level trauma center. Since join-
ing the foundation, Chris has raised more than 
$100 million for our safety net health system. 
In his first two years alone in the position, he 
led two multimillion-dollar capital campaigns 
that allowed for the completion of the Parisi 
House on the Hill and the purchase of a new 
linear accelerator for the Sobrato Cancer Cen-
ter. He also was a major champion for Meas-
ure A, which generated $840 million to build 
Sobrato Pavillion, the new adult hospital build-
ing and a major health center in downtown 
San Jose. Chris was integral in Santa Clara 
County’s COVID–19 response, where he 
helped secure over $30 million in funds and 
donated supplies to protect healthcare work-
ers, expand testing, and support vaccination 
efforts. 
I have been honored to see his work first-
hand and am so grateful for his steadfast re-
solve to help ensure that our safety net re-
mains strong. He’s been rightfully called a 
‘‘nonprofit superhero’’ as his efforts can be 
seen throughout the Valley Medical Center 
campus. Please join me in thanking Mr. Wilder 
for his years of dedication and wishing him the 
very best in his retirement.

HONORING VICTORIA BRANDON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Victoria Bran-
don, whom I have named the 5th Congres-
sional District’s 2022 Climate Crisis Champion 
from Lake County for her inspiring leadership 
in combatting the climate crisis currently grip-
ping our communities. 
Victoria Brandon was born in New York City 
and attended Brandeis University. She has 
been a California resident since 1976, and she 
has resided in Lake County since 1981. 
Ms. Brandon has been an active community 
member, beginning her service in 2004 as 
Secretary of the Chi Council for the Clear 
Lake Hitch, where she served until 2020. The 
next year, she increased her involvement by 
joining the Sierra Club Lake Group, followed 
by the Tuleyome Board of Directors and then 
the Sierra Club Redwood Chapter, which she 
still serves to this day. From 2009 to 2015, 
Ms. Brandon represented the Sierra Club on 
the California Invasive Species Advisory Com-
mittee, which she chaired in 2013. Addition-
ally, she chaired the Sierra Club Agriculture 
and Food Task Force from 2014 to 2015. Ms. 
Brandon was also a member of the Sierra 
Club national political team from 2013 to 2021, 
serving as the chair from 2016 to 2021. 
Ms. Brandon has worked on many essential 
environmental projects, such as the designa-
tion of Cache Creek as Wild and Scenic River 
in 2005, the adoption of California Strategic 
Framework on invasive species in 2010, the 
development of Sierra Club policy on Agri-
culture and Food in 2015, and the designation 
of Berryessa Snow Mountain National monu-
ment in 2015. Ms. Brandon founded the Sierra 
Club Grassroots Network Team on Food and 
Agriculture in 2016 and organized the data on 
Clear Lake Hitch spawning migrations from 
2004 until 2020. When Ms. Brandon is not 
fighting for climate justice, she enjoys reading, 
gardening, and other outdoor activities. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Victoria 
Brandon has dedicated her life to combating 
the climate crisis in our communities. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

DON CHILDEARS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Don Childears of the Colo-
rado Bankers Association on his retirement. 
For more than forty years, Don has served 
the Colorado banking community in his role as 
Chief Executive Officer of the Colorado Bank-
ers Association. He got his start in public pol-
icy on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. and 
managed several successful congressional 
campaigns before joining CBA in 1975. During 
his time at CBA, Don navigated the adoption 
of branch banking in Colorado and was instru-
mental in creating the Executive Development 
Institute at the Graduate School of Banking at 
Colorado. He also worked with Congress on 
legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 
the Dodd-Frank Act, and federal legislation to 
protect banks and other businesses from liabil-
ity surrounding Y2K issues. Don has been a 
national leader in helping banks navigate the 
conflict between state and federal cannabis 
laws, and he has been a strong supporter of 
the SAFE Banking Act. 
In addition, Don has served on several 
boards and committees including BancInsure 
Board of Directors and Reinsurance Com-
mittee; Graduate School of Banking at Univer-
sity of Colorado; Trustee and Treasurer, Grad-
uate School of Banking (University of Wis-
consin-Madison); and Board Member of the 
American Bankers Association along with par-
ticipation on several subcommittees and task 
forces. Don has a passion for education, and 
he teaches and lectures to many banking and 
law schools including the University of Denver, 
University of Colorado, and George Mason 
University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. His 
vast presence and ongoing contribution to the 
banking community here and across the coun-
try earned him the Denver Business Journal’s 
Pinnacle Award for The Most Admired CEO in 
November 2020. Don has also been recog-
nized with industry awards including the 
Scarboro Award from CU’s Graduate School 
of Banking. 
In addition to Don’s work professionally, he 
has served his community in other capacities. 
He has served on the Common Sense Insti-
tute board, Vice-Chair of Let Colorado Vote, 
and Chair of the Colorado Competitive Coun-
cil, to name a few. He remains active on many 
other campaigns and initiatives, task forces, 
nominating committees, advisory boards, and 
charitable and political committees. 
I have had the privilege of working with Don 
on many different occasions and always ap-
preciate his advice and insight on many 
issues. His hard work and dedication to the 
banking industry is tremendous. I wish Don all 
the best in retirement and send gratitude for 
his service to our community, the State of Col-
orado, and the United States of America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
AGAMYRAT AGAMBAYEZ 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember and honor the life of Dr. 
Agamyrat Agambayez. This man, still in the 
prime of his life, was ruthlessly murdered in 
broad daylight in Tempe, Arizona. The killer 
took the life of a husband, a father, and an in-
credible immigrant to this country who was all 
set to start his new career working at Intel. 
This young man was loved by many and led 
an impressive life that will not go unnoticed. 
Dr. Agamyrat Agambayez was an impres-
sive scholar receiving his second Ph.D at Ari-
zona State University. He had also recently 
accepted an engineering job at Intel that he 
worked so diligently to get. But most impor-
tantly, Dr. Agamyrat Agambayez was a friend 
to many, an extraordinary husband and a 
dedicated father to his two year old son. Dr. 
Agamyrat’s wife, Sumeyra Agambayez states, 
‘‘He had a real bright future . . . he was dedi-
cated, smart, and studied tirelessly for years 
at universities to start giving back to the com-
munity here and abroad in Turkmenistan.’’ 
I condemn the crime here, and the loss to 
humanity. I am appalled at the growing crime 
and homeless problems in Tempe and Phoe-
nix. Our people need to be assured they can 
live and work in a community without fear of 
a murderous car jacker lurking to take one’s 
life and property. 
I mourn for his young family. His son will be 
left with little memory of his father. But I hope 
one day his son will read these words, and the 
words of others, and know that his father was 
a bright star in the sky and made the world a 
better place. He lived and died with honor. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his loved 
ones and shall Dr. Agamyrat Agambayez 
never be forgotten.

CONGRATULATING 
EMILY 
BEAR 
OF ROCKFORD FOR WINNING A 
GRAMMY AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Emily Bear on her Grammy 
Award for ‘‘Best Musical Theater Album.’’ 
A graduate of Guilford High School, 20- 
year-old Emily Bear is a native of Rockford, Il-
linois. Since graduating in 2017, she has re-
leased numerous albums, scored major films 
with Warner Brothers and has performed at 
internationally renowned settings, such as the 
Lincoln Center, the Hollywood Bowl and Car-
negie Hall. This year, Emily won her first 
Grammy Award with Abigail Barlow for Best 
Musical Theater Album for ‘‘The Unofficial 
Bridgerton Musical.’’ Last year, Emily and Abi-
gail began the project inspired by the popular 
Netflix series by going through the show’s plot 
as if it were a musical. With her hard work, 
Emily has turned a viral social media sensa-
tion into a Grammy Award. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to congratulate 
Emily Bear on her first Grammy Award and 
wish her much success in her life and career.

RECOGNIZING ANNIE BURNS-HICKS 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to recognize one of Northwest Indiana’s 
true pioneers, Annie Burns-Hicks, the School 
City of Hammond’s first African American 
teacher. Earlier this year, the Hammond 
School Board voted unanimously to rename 
Maywood Elementary School, which she at-
tended in her youth and at which she taught 
for the majority of her career, to Annie Burns- 
Hicks Elementary School. The School City of 
Hammond will be honoring Ms. Burns-Hicks at 
a special event taking place on April 28, 2022. 
The eldest of thirteen children, Annie’s fam-
ily relocated from Mississippi to Hammond, In-
diana, in 1944. Her parents, Albert and Mary 
Burns, sought a better life for their children

after her father witnessed the brutal lynching 
of two young black boys. Annie recalls her fa-
ther telling her and her siblings of his expecta-
tion that they strive to make the world a better 
place, a lesson that has remained with her 
throughout her lifetime. It was this desire to 
make a positive change in her community that 
likely led to her graduation from Ball State 
Teachers College in hopes of returning to 
teach in Hammond. 
Unfortunately, Annie’s desire to improve her 
community by educating the city’s children 
would not come without opposition. Despite 
being five years after the landmark Brown v. 
Board of Education of Topeka ruling of the Su-
preme Court to end segregation in schools, 
Ms. Burns-Hicks’s application for a teaching 
position was rejected without consideration, as 
she was told the city was ‘‘not ready for a col-
ored teacher.’’ Undeterred, and remembering 
her father’s inspirational words encouraging 
her to be a force of change, Annie pressed on 
through the courts and won, thus allowing her 
to become the first African American teacher 
in the city of Hammond in 1960 and paving 
the way for the many future teachers who 
would follow in her footsteps. During her ten-
ure, Ms. Burns-Hicks co-authored the first full- 
day kindergarten program in the city, a con-
tribution that truly enhanced the educational 
opportunities for the community’s young chil-
dren. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you 
and my other distinguished colleagues join me 
in honoring Annie Burns-Hicks. Ms. Burns- 
Hicks broke barriers as Hammond’s first Afri-
can American teacher, and in doing so, has 
been a true inspiration and a source of tre-
mendous pride to her community. Throughout 
her more than forty years of teaching, she 
touched countless lives. It is fitting that the 
school now bears her name for the genera-
tions to come.

IN HONOR OF LOUIS BURKOT 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Louis Burkot as he celebrates 40 
years as the founding artistic director of Opera 
North in Lebanon, NH. 
Among his accomplishments, Louis has 
conducted the Dartmouth College Glee Club 
and more than 700 Opera North Resident Art-
ists from around the world. His expertise in 
vocal and choral music has contributed signifi-
cantly to the Upper Valley community and be-
yond. Louis’ knowledge of vocal and operatic 
music has been invaluable for many young 
singers, many of whom have gone on to major 
careers around the world. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, I thank 
Louis for his many years of service, and for 
being a part of what makes the Granite State 
so great. I am honored to recognize and con-
gratulate Louis on 40 years of incredible work, 
and I wish him many more. 
VIRGINIA THEATRE, CHAMPAIGN, 
IL 100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Virginia 
Theatre in Champaign, Illinois, which cele-
brated 100 years of business on December 
28, 2021. 
In 1921, Charles ‘‘C.C.’’ Pyle made the deci-
sion to build a major entertainment venue in 
downtown Champaign, an area that had been 
known as a cultural hotspot. He initially had a 
vision of a 12-story hotel with a large theatre 
space, but that quickly changed. The final 
building resulted in a stand-alone, multipur-
pose performing arts center. 
In January of 2000, the Champaign Park 
District made countless efforts to prevent this 
landmark from demolition. Once they assumed 
control of the theatre, it went on to grow into 
a $10 million restoration project to bring the 
theatre back to life. 
Through the years, the Virginia Theatre has 
been the ‘‘place to be’’ for friends, families, 
and colleagues in the community. The Theatre 
hosts local productions, concerts, movies, live 
theatrical plays, stand-up comedy events, and 
many more. 
Congratulations to the Virginia Theatre on 
their 100th anniversary, and I wish them all 
the best in the years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF PRIVATE OLIVER CROMWELL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy of Pri-
vate Oliver Cromwell, one of the most deco-
rated Black soldiers who served in the Amer-
ican Revolutionary War. 
Private Cromwell was born in 1753 in Mans-
field Township, New Jersey, and in 1776 he 
enlisted in the 2nd New Jersey Regiment. He 
crossed the Delaware River with General 
George Washington and went on to fight for 
American independence in the battles of Tren-
ton, Princeton, Brandywine, Monmouth, Short 
Hills, and Yorktown. At the conclusion of the 
war, Cromwell received the Badge of Merit for 
six years of faithful service to the Army and 
was honorably discharged by General Wash-
ington in 1783. 
Following his service, Cromwell fathered 15 
children in Burlington Country and loved to 
share stories of his time as a ‘‘Drummer in the 
Revolution’’ with his family and the community. 
Cromwell passed away at 101 years old in 
1853, and he is buried in Burlington at the 
Broad Street Methodist Church cemetery. Oli-
ver Cromwell risked everything fighting for 
freedom in a country that did not recognize his 
own right to freedom. For these sacrifices, Oli-
ver Cromwell should be eternally remembered 
for his contributions toward America’s inde-
pendence. Burlington County is grateful for 
Private Cromwell’s dedication, sacrifice, patri-
otism, and honorable personal conduct. 
Nine generations of his descendants have 
resided in Burlington County, some of whom 
still reside in the 3rd District today and con-
tinue to honor their familial legacy through 
community engagement, service, and historic 
preservation. 
I 
am 
grateful 
for 
Private 
Cromwell’s descendants’ continued contribu-
tions to our community and am proud to be 
honoring the life and legacy of their ancestor 
on this day.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MARVIN YELLOWHAIR 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Marvin 
Yellowhair, a beloved Navajo community lead-
er who passed away in March. 
Throughout Marvin’s life, he made immense 
contributions to numerous fields, and is re-
membered as a devoted son, brother, father, 
husband, uncle, nephew, grandfather, coach, 
author, musician, actor, storyteller, runner, car-
penter, 
politician, 
Council 
Delegate, 
and 
School Board Member. 
After graduating from Rough Rock High 
School and attending Mesa Community Col-
lege, Dine College, Northern Arizona Univer-
sity, and the University of New Mexico, he 
dedicated his life to the advancement of Nav-
ajo language, culture, and history developing 
bilingual and bicultural curriculum materials 
and publishing several books of his own. 
He continued his efforts developing Navajo 
language materials and books throughout his 
career, translating for notable artists, authors, 
and craftsmen. Among many accomplish-
ments, he was the voice actor for Darth Vader 
from the Navajo version of the movie Star 
Wars, and worked with Oxford University out 
of New York to develop an English and Nav-
ajo picture dictionary and Rosetta Stone audio 
recordings to support the teaching and learn-
ing of the Navajo language. 
Throughout 30 years at Rough Rock Com-
munity School, as both a teacher of Navajo 
language, and a beloved basketball, football, 
and baseball coach, Marvin was well-known 
by colleagues and students for his passion for 
Navajo culture and history, and his gift for sto-
rytelling and leadership. 
A devoted advocate for Navajo self-deter-
mination in education and strong supporter of 
Navajo Nation veterans, his legacy in the 
Rough Rock and Black Mesa communities will 
live on for generations to come. 
The Navajo Nation and the state of Arizona 
have lost a great leader. My wife and I are 
keeping his many loved ones, friends, stu-
dents, and colleagues in our hearts as they 
mourn his passing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E406 
April 26, 2022 
For 75 years, this organization has dedi-
cated itself to the betterment of Pinellas Coun-
ty’s future, which lies in the hands of our com-
munity’s children. 
The Juvenile Welfare Board works with our 
county’s children from an early age to ensure 
that both they, and their parents, caregivers, 
and family members receive a solid foundation 
on which to build their education. The Board’s 
School Readiness program prepares children 
for their critical kindergarten education, which 
is crucial for their future success in the class-
room. The JWB supports our county’s youth 
throughout their education, with the programs 
they fund driving them to meet not only impor-
tant developmental milestones but promoting 
behaviors and attitudes necessary for learning 
and engagement. 
Beyond the classroom, the JWB works tire-
lessly to strengthen the communities from 
which our future leaders grow. Focusing on 
the mental health of our children is one of the 
Board’s primary goals, making sure any type 
of mental illness is diagnosed and treated be-
fore it becomes an impediment for their future 
success. They also work to stop preventable 
deaths within the county, combating unsafe 
sleep practices for infants, child drowning, and 
head trauma, so that no family must deal with 
the tremendous loss of a child. 
The JWB’s mission also includes providing 
relief for the families of Pinellas County when 
they need it. From rental and food assistance, 
eviction prevention services, and helping with 
affordable childcare, the JWB ensures that 
any family that needs a helping hand is given 
one. 
The Juvenile Welfare Board of Pinellas 
County is a powerful example of the power we 
can have on our communities if we simply 
dare to try. Their efforts deserve veneration in 
this Congress, not only in appreciation of their 
efforts, but as an example of the power of 
community.

OF 
ALS 
RE-
SEARCH AT THE DEPARTMENT 
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, as the son of 
a veteran, father of a veteran, and a veteran 
myself, I rise in support of important work 
being done at the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) regarding research and develop-
ment of treatments for amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative 
diseases. 
This work is combining the capabilities of 
National Polytrauma Centers, like the James 
A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital in Tampa, Florida, 
with the expertise of the private sector to give 
hope to veterans who are battling these ill-
nesses, everywhere. 
Veterans are 60 percent more likely to be 
diagnosed with ALS compared to the general 
population. 
More research needs to be done to under-
stand the connection, which goes back at 
least 100 years, between military service and 
ALS, as well as to ensure we are able to 
achieve the best possible outcomes for our 
veterans. 
I applaud the VA for continuing to make this 
a priority and look forward to seeing the po-
tential of these partnerships.

HONORING CHIEF RAINER J. 
NAVARRO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Chief Rainer J. 
Navarro in celebration of his outstanding ca-
reer in the Santa Rosa Police Department. 
Chief Navarro was born in Lynwood, Cali-
fornia, in 1969 to Rainer and Cecilia Navarro. 
He served in the United States Navy from 
1987 to 1989. After his time in the Navy, he 
attended Santa Rosa Junior College and 
earned an associate of arts degree in 1991. 
He later earned a bachelor’s degree in crimi-
nal justice administration from Sonoma State 
University in 1996 and a master’s degree in 
law enforcement and public safety from the 
University of San Diego in 2018. 
Chief Navarro began his career in the Santa 
Rose Police Department in 1992 as a patrol 
officer. In 2006, he was promoted to Sergeant 
and six years later, was again promoted. As a 
Lieutenant, he oversaw the Traffic and Special 
Events Bureau and served as Watch Com-
mander. Chief Navarro made Captain in 2015 
and supervised both the Special Services Divi-
sion and Field Services Division. After over 25 
years of service, the city named him Chief of 
the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2019. 
Chief Navarro’s personal values focus on 
his faith, family, and service. He volunteers 
with Special Olympics, Shop with a Cop, 
Roseland Unified School District, and Rose-
wood Gospel Mission. Chief Navarro also has 
served on the Santa Rosa Violence Preven-
tion Partnership Policy Team, California Police 
Chiefs Association, CHOPS Teen Club Board 
of Directors, Social Advocates for Youth Board 
of Directors, and the Sonoma County Juvenile 
Justice Coordinating Council. 
Chief Navarro has been a dedicated mem-
ber of the Santa Rosa Bible Church. He mar-
ried his high school sweetheart, Diedre, in 
1989 and they have been happily married for 
33 years. Together, they have two children, 
Trent and Alexa, and two grandchildren, Cas-
pian and Griffin. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Chief 
Navarro has dedicated his life to serving the 
people of Santa Rosa through his career in 
law enforcement. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR 
CHARLOTTE WILCOX 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the distinguished career of 
Charlotte Wilcox, the Mayor of the City of 
Highland Village, Texas. Mayor Wilcox is retir-
ing following her seven-year long tenure in 
mayoral office, and almost two decades of 
public service in Highland Village city govern-
ment. 
Mayor Wilcox and her family moved to High-
land Village in 1995. In 2006, she was ap-
pointed to the city’s Zoning and Development 
Commission, before being elected to Place 3 
of the Highland Village City Council three 
years later. She served in this position until 
her fellow councilmembers appointed her to 
mayoral office in 2015 following the retirement 
of her predecessor. In May 2015, she was 
elected as Mayor, and due to term limitations, 
will conclude her service on the Highland Vil-
lage City Council in May 2022. 
Throughout her service in her public office, 
Mayor Wilcox has worked tirelessly for the 
economic and physical well-being of her con-
stituency. She has been instrumental in ensur-
ing funding for vital improvements to Highland 
Village’s highway infrastructure, as well as the 
establishment of half a dozen parks and rec-
reational facilities throughout the city. Thanks 
to Mayor Wilcox’s efforts, many trails, parks, 
roads, and walkways have been constructed 
and expanded to maximize her city’s quality of 
life. 
Furthermore, Mayor Wilcox oversaw the 
opening of many new businesses and the re-
modeling of many older ones to strengthen 
and expand the City’s tax base. Under her fis-
cal leadership, the city achieved a AAA Bond 
Rating. 
Mayor Wilcox, in addition to overseeing the 
City’s impressive record of financial stability 
and economic development, has also served 
as a strong advocate for Highland Village’s 
highly esteemed city staff. Under her adminis-
tration, the Council approved two new paid 
holidays and secured a competitive benefits 
package for city employees. 
As Mayor Wilcox concludes her estimable 
tenure as Mayor, I join the residents and busi-
nesses of Highland Village in applauding her 
dedication to city improvement, governmental 
transparency, and community involvement. 
She has truly been a valuable contributor to 
our North Texas community, and I wish her all 
the best in her future endeavors.

HONORING NASCAR TEAM OWNER 
CHIP GANASSI FOR HIS EXEM-
PLARY CAREER 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor NASCAR team owner Chip Ganassi 
for twenty years as the owner of Chip Ganassi 
Racing. 
After a successful career as a racer, Mr. 
Ganassi purchased the SABCO team in 2001 
and quickly renamed it Chip Ganassi Racing. 
Over the next 20 years, his team achieved a 
combined 40 wins in the NASCAR Cup Series 
and the NASCAR Xfinity series. Most notably, 
Chip Ganassi Racing experienced great suc-
cess in the NASCAR Cup Series where it 
achieved 20 victories along with 36 pole posi-
tions, 196 top-five finishes, and 474 top-10 fin-
ishes. 
Mr. Ganassi’s experience and knowledge 
immediately propelled his team to great suc-
cess. In Mr. Ganassi’s inaugural season as 
owner, Sterling Marlin finished in third place in 
the 2001 NASCAR Cup Series championship. 
This success quickly established a culture of 
winning at Chip Ganassi Racing that attracted 
some of NASCAR’s best drivers. While racing 
for Ganassi, Jamie McMurray became the first 
driver to win NASCAR’s Indianapolis 500 and 
IndyCar’s Daytona 500 in the same year. Ad-
ditionally, 
household-name 
Kyle 
Larson 
earned four first place finishes in a single sea-
son as a member of Ganassi’s team. Further-
more, Mr. Ganassi’s achievements extend be-
yond results on the racetrack. His unique and 
effective business sense set new precedents 
for success in NASCAR. Unlike many other 
team owners, team ownership was his only 
business. He also maintained an impressive 
28-year relationship with Target and secured it 
as a long-time sponsor for Chip Ganassi Rac-
ing. 
After retiring this past Fall, Mr. Ganassi 
leaves behind an impressive legacy that I am 
proud to acknowledge today. He is highly re-
garded by other team owners and racers alike. 
His accomplishments reflect his dedication to 
racing and his intense desire for improvement. 
I know I speak for our entire community in 
wishing him and his family continued success 
and happiness in his retirement. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Mr. Chip Ganassi for his outstanding 
accomplishments and contributions as a rac-
ing team owner.

HONORING POLICE CHIEF MANJIT 
SAPPAL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today along with Congressman 
JOHN
GARAMENDI, to honor Chief Manjit 
Sappal as he retires from his outstanding, six- 
year service as the Chief of Police for the city 
of Martinez, California. 
Born in the United Kingdom, Chief Sappal 
and his family immigrated to the United States 
in 1981 and settled in the Bay Area, where he 
has lived ever since. In the late 1990s, Chief 
Sappal began his 26-year-long career in law 
enforcement as a police officer in Pittsburg, 
California. Later, he moved to the Richmond 
Police Department, where he worked for 18 
years and became a captain. While working 
as a police officer, Mr. Sappal graduated from 
Golden Gate University with highest honors, 
earning a master’s degree in public adminis-
tration. He also graduated from the prestigious 
FBI National Academy and the Police Execu-
tive Research Forum’s Senior Management In-
stitute for Police. 
Chief Sappal’s rigorous work ethic and im-
pressive credentials propelled him to the office 
of Chief of Police of Martinez in 2015, a posi-
tion from which he retired from on March 17, 
2022. Throughout his career in law enforce-
ment, Chief Sappal has worked in several po-
sitions. From Homicide Investigator to Guns 
and Gang Detective, he has always put him-
self on the line to make his community safer. 
While these experiences were memorable, 
Chief Sappal considers his time as Chief of 
Police, working with an amazing, high-per-
forming team, to be the highlight of his career. 
Chief Sappal’s service extends beyond law 
enforcement. As a member of the Contra 
Costa Council for Homelessness and the Mar-
tinez Rotary and Kiwanis, Chief Sappal has 
worked hard to maintain trust with the commu-
nity and keep the public safe. 
After retirement, Chief Sappal looks forward 
to spending more time with his wife, Tina, and 
their two teenage children, Alexis Lily and An-
drew Tyler. While the people of Martinez will 
miss his excellent police work and leadership, 
the sense of empathy and compassion he es-
tablished in the community will last a lifetime. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Chief 
Manjit Sappal has served our community 
through his exceptional career in law enforce-
ment. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor him here today.

HONORING THE LIFE AND PATRI-
OTIC SERVICE OF KENNETH DUN-
CAN DICKSON 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commemorate the life and serv-
ice of Kenneth Duncan Dickson. Ken strove 
each and every day of his extraordinary life to 
leave a better world for his children and 
grandchildren. He was received into the Arms 
of the Lord after a hard-fought battle against 
COVID–19 on August 19, 2021. This great 
American, and proud Texan, is survived by his 
loving wife of forty-four years, Judith Dion 
Dickson; his sons Kenneth Craig Dickson (wife 
Lynne) 
and 
Jason 
Keith 
Dickson 
(wife 
Lauren); and his grandchildren Abigail Peavey 
(husband 
Rafe), 
Macy 
Dickson, 
Cohen 
Dickson and Savannah Dickson; and many 
other family members and friends. 
Ken was born on December 29, 1938, to 
Kenneth Taylor Dickson and Trixie Duncan 
Dickson. After graduating from W.W. Samuell 
High School in 1957, he went on to earn a de-
gree in Business and Agriculture from East 
Texas State University in Commerce, Texas. 
As a man instilled with the virtue of patriotism, 
Ken served in the United States Army National 
Guard in the 49th Armored Division after grad-
uation. He started his career in insurance and 
apparel manufacturing wherein he owned and 
operated a number of showrooms at the Dal-
las Apparel Mart. Subsequently, in the 1980s, 
Ken was introduced to the lively oil and gas 
industry into which he would pour his profes-
sional talents for the rest of his life. Even at 
the ripe age of eighty-two, one might have 
found Ken researching new technologies, 
making phone calls, and consulting green-
horns in the industry. Ken was also a guber-
natorially appointed member of the Interstate 
Oil and Gas Compact Commission. 
As a pillar of the Rockwall community, Ken 
led the charge for over forty years to protect 
the American Dream and the foundational val-
ues that make this country great. He was a 
founding member of the Rockwall County Re-
publicans, served four years as a City Council-
man, was a Republican Precinct Chair, Elec-
tion Judge, and a Delegate to the Republican 
State Conventions. Moreover, among the 
greatest services he provided was to work 
with Congressman Ralph Hall during Mr. Hall’s 
election campaigns. Ken received the Ralph 
M. Hall Chairman’s Award for his lifetime of 
dedication to the cause of the Republican 
Party. 
Madam Speaker, I have shared with the 
House today only a small portion of this great 
American’s life. His accomplishments, the joy 
he has brought, the services he has wrought, 
and the extraordinary love that he had for his 
family and friends could fill volumes. I have re-
quested the United States flag be flown over 
our Nation’s Capitol to recognize Kenneth 
Duncan Dickson’s patriotism and devotion to 
God, 
Family, 
and 
Country. 
Furthermore, 
Madam Speaker, I extend my personal condo-
lences to the Dickson family for the loss of 
such an extraordinary man of service and 
duty. May God bless his soul.

IN MEMORY OF REBECCA 
ADELMAN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the incredible life of Rebecca 
M. Adelman, an accomplished young woman 
and personal friend who passed away in April 
of 2020. Rebecca would have become 39 
years old on May 14, 2022 and is adored and 
missed as ever before. Rebecca is remem-
bered by many as a caring healthcare pro-
vider, passionate academic, and noble public 
servant. In addition to these accolades, Re-
becca was proud to be the daughter to Patri-
cia and Howard Adelman, sister to Mara (Pat) 
and Mike (Dani) Adelman, devoted spouse of 
Caroline Lemelin, and loving mother of her 
greatest joys, twin sons Rory and Finn 
Adelman, who turn four years old this Spring. 
I am honored to join with Rebecca’s loving 
family to recognize her impactful life.

April 26, 2022 
Upon Rebecca graduating from Wellesley 
College in 2005, she had a world of oppor-
tunity ahead of her. She headed to Wash-
ington to work for ABC News and eventually 
joined the Obama presidential campaign’s 
staff, energetically serving the Vice President’s 
press team as the general election ap-
proached. After President Obama and then- 
Vice President Biden’s landslide election in 
2009, Rebecca was given a position on the 
President’s transition team, managing press at 
the inauguration, and then joined the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 
as one of the Administration’s first DHHS staff 
placements. Ms. Adelman rose throughout the 
agency, serving as the Special Assistant to 
the Administrator at the Health Resources and 
Services Administration (HRSA), as DHHS’s 
Deputy Liaison to the White House, and Act-
ing Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary. 
Inspired by her HHS colleagues to be a 
‘‘doer rather than a talker,’’ as well as by the 
idea of direct healthcare service, she achieved 
her status as a Registered Nurse (RN) and 
earned a Master of Public Health degree with 
Honors from Johns Hopkins University. Her 
nursing career began in New York as a neo-
natal intensive care unit nurse at Mount Sinai, 
before advancing to become Clinical Nurse 
Manager and then Patient Care Director at 
New York Presbyterian Hospital. No matter 
the 
professional 
arena 
or 
personal 
cir-
cumstances, her intuition and broad skill set 
enabled her to perform at the highest level of 
proficiency. At the time of Ms. Adelman’s 
passing, she was the Nurse Manager respon-
sible for running the entire neonatal intensive 
care unit at New York-Presbyterian, an incred-
ible achievement to her career journey. 
Madam Speaker, Rebecca M. Adelman ac-
complished so much and earned the love and 
respect of so many during her short time with 
us, and she is truly missed. Her family and all 
who knew her and benefitted from her many 
contributions to the community can attest to 
her remarkable impact and inspiration, as well 
as her enduring optimism and commitment to 
community. Two years after her passing, Re-
becca Adelman’s incredible legacy continues 
to improve the lives of others and will last for 
a long time to come. Our nation is better off 
because of the service of Ms. Rebecca M. 
Adelman, and we are forever grateful for her 
many contributions.

HONORING RUE MAPP 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Rue Mapp, 
whom I have named the 5th Congressional 
District’s 2022 Climate Crisis Champion for 
her inspiring leadership in combatting the cli-
mate crisis currently gripping our communities. 
Ms. Mapp was born in Oakland, California. 
She earned a bachelor’s degree in the history 
of art, with a minor in city and regional plan-
ning from the University of California, Berke-
ley. She also earned a Women in Leadership 
Certificate from Mills College, Institute for Civic 
Leadership in her hometown of Oakland. 
Ms. Mapp founded Outdoor Afro in 2009 to 
celebrate and inspire Black people to connect 
with each other through nature. For the past 
five years, Outdoor Afro has included a policy 
and education cohort that has advocated for 
environmental protection legislation, including 
the Land Water Conservation Fund, which 
funds parks and public land. Today, Outdoor 
Afro includes over 60,000 participants and 
over 100 volunteer leaders who promote and 
participate in outdoor activities, such as hiking, 
fishing, biking and more. 
Ms. Mapp has received various honors for 
her environmental work. Ms. Mapp has been 
appointed to the California State Parks and 
Recreation Commission, and the Pacific For-
est and Watershed Lands Stewardship Coun-
cil’s Foundation for Youth Investment, where

siast, hunter, and fisher. She loves to cook, 
sew, write, and spend time with her loved 
ones. Ms. Mapp’s family includes her hus-
band, Darin; her three children, Seth, Delaney, 
and William; her grandchild, Kendrick; and her 
beloved Pitbull, Lulu. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Rue 
Mapp has dedicated her life to combating the 
climate crisis in our communities through Out-
door Afro. Therefore, it is fitting and proper 
that we honor her here today. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JERRICA PROFERES 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Jerrica Proferes 
for her distinguished career in service to this 
Nation and to the people of Tennessee’s Sev-
enth Congressional District. 
As a Military Police Officer stationed at Fort 
Drum, Jerrica began her career of service with 
the 23rd Military Police Company. For over 
three years, Jerrica provided law enforcement 
and support for more than 40,000 soldiers, ci-
vilians, and families. In Iraq, she served val-
iantly as a member of the Immediate Reaction 
Force team and Riot Response team as a 
Corrections Officer. 
Shortly thereafter, Jerrica joined the 8th 
Army Headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, as 
a Human Resource Specialist and Operations 
Manager. Through her service in South Korea, 
Jerrica embraced the important operations role 
and admirably performed her duties. She con-
ducted countless briefs, statistic reports, meet-
ings, and training courses during her time in 
Seoul, and managed overseas job placements 
for over 2,500 soldiers throughout South 
Korea. 
Jerrica later joined the Defense Language 
Institute in Monterey, California, as a Small 
Group Leader and Operations Manager. For 
nearly two years, she managed the operations 
and logistics side of the Institute, ensuring that 
our servicemembers were properly trained in 
languages of vital national security interests, 
such as Persian Farsi and Afghan-Dari. 
Following her military career, she continued 
her habit of service by assisting veterans 
through VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) at 
Austin Peay State University. As veterans 
struggled to transition to life after service, 
Jerrica helped ease their transition by assist-
ing them in submitting campus applications, 
registering for courses, creating educational 
goals, and maintaining successful study plans. 
Her time with VSOC as a mentor, tutor, and 
Administrative Assistant left an indelible mark 
on the lives of servicemembers that will not be 
forgotten. 
As a State Senator for the Tennessee Gen-
eral Assembly, I had the pleasure of working 
with Jerrica while she served as our legislative 
intern. Through her efficiency, hard work, and 
clear skill, I knew that I needed to hire her as 
a permanent staffer. When I was elected to 
Congress and putting together a team to serve 
the people of Tennessee’s Seventh Congres-
sional District, Jerrica was at the top of my list. 
Since January 2019, Jerrica has been the in-
dispensable core of my office. From the innu-
merable tasks required to set up a congres-
sional office, to creating efficient systems and 
ensuring the smooth flow of all operations, 
Jerrica has gone above and beyond in her 
work, demonstrating the meaning of servant- 
leadership by example. Our ability to serve the 
7th district would not be where it is without her 
hard work and dedication as Director of 
Scheduling and Operations. 
Jerrica is passionate about what she be-
lieves, observant of other people’s needs, and, 
above all, serves others. Even now, as she 
transitions from my office, she turns to another

avenue of service to this Nation: educating its 
youth. 
Reflecting on her three and a half years of 
service in my office, Jerrica has performed her 
role with all honor and distinction. It has been 
an honor and a privilege to have her as a 
member of my staff. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives, with some regret that she is 
leaving but immense gratitude for her pres-
ence in our office, I commend Jerrica Proferes 
for pursuing the great responsibility of edu-
cating the next generation, and I thank her for 
her faithful-and diligent service to the people 
of Tennessee’s Seventh Congressional Dis-
trict.

CONGRATULATING 
HUNGARIAN 
PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN 
ON RE-ELECTION 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Hungarian Prime Minister 
Viktor Orban on his resounding reelection. The 
people of Hungary, in a super majority, not 
only supported him, but his party. In my view, 
the recipe to his success in Hungary is simple: 
put Hungary first, always. By focusing on what 
is good for Hungarians, Mr. Orban rejected 
internationalism, socialism, and subservience 
to non-sensical European Union mandates. It 
is a model, quite frankly, we should follow in 
the United States, where we seal our borders 
to protect our citizens and our economy, 
where we focus on rebuilding families, where 
we focus on the spirit of our people through 
God, not just material pursuits, and where we 
make economic policies that protect our own 
people and do not subsidize others. 
I am also including in the RECORD the fol-
lowing statement from Judicial Watch and Mr. 
Tom Fitton, its President. They sent a team of 
election observers to Hungary and found it 
was a well run, orderly, and fair election, with 
no corruption. The same cannot be said about 
our own elections. Congratulations to Mr. 
Orban, and Mr. Fitton, for the good work they 
are doing. 
JUDICIAL WATCH TEAM OBSERVES HUNGARY 
ELECTIONS—PRAISES ELECTION DAY PROC-
ESSES 
WASHINGTON, 
DC.—Judicial 
Watch 
an-
nounced today that it sent a six-member 
team to observe Election Day procedures 
during the April 3, 2022, Hungarian par-
liamentary and referendum national elec-
tions. A Judicial Watch report on the Hun-
garian election concluded that the adminis-
tration of the vote on Election Day was effi-
cient, orderly, and unremarkable. 
The team was led by attorneys who pre-
viously worked for the Department of Jus-
tice’s Voting Section monitoring state and 
federal elections in the United States. The 
team also included lawyers who had mon-
itored elections for Judicial Watch. 
Judicial Watch’s representatives observed 
voting in 52 precincts at 27 locations in and 
around Budapest. The Judicial Watch team 
did not observe any meaningful problems 
throughout the day. Despite a high national 
turnout rate approaching 70%, lines were 
usually brief and only rarely exceeded 15 
minutes. The Hungarian electoral practice of 
including representatives of every party of 
any size at each voter registration desk ap-
pears to have contributed to a low-con-
troversy environment. In some ways, accord-
ing to the report, the administration of the 
vote was more effective, and less chaotic, 
than what team members had observed in 
previous elections in parts of the United 
States. 
Judicial Watch’s monitoring methodology 
emphasizes ballot access, meaning the abil-
ity of citizens to easily register and cast an 
equal vote in an election. It particularly fo-
cuses on recording specific Election Day 
problems 
concerning 
unlawful 
election-
eering, arbitrary variations in the rules for 
voting, aggressive voting assistance, unusual 
ballot handling, voter intimidation or con-
frontations, and voter ‘‘turn aways.’’ 
Judicial Watch noted that its methodology 
contrasted with the approach adopted by 
other international observers, who often 
criticized the Hungarian elections based on 
value judgments about matters like media 
bias, negative campaigning, campaign fi-
nance policy, and the prevalence of women 
candidates. The report stated that these ‘‘are 
matters more appropriately addressed by 
editorial boards, not election monitoring 
teams.’’ 
‘‘The transnational Left swarmed Hungary 
in order to try to create controversy about 
the election of their ideological opponent, 
Viktor Orban. By contrast, Judicial Watch’s 
expert election observer team found vir-
tually no issues in the conduct of the elec-
tions in Hungary,’’ stated Judicial Watch 
President Tom Fitton.

ROCKFORD 
NATIVE 
ROBERT ISTAD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Robert Istad for receiving a 
Grammy Award for ‘‘Best Choral Perform-
ance.’’ 
Robert Istad is a native of Rockford, Illinois 
and a graduate of the Christian Life High 
School. Now a professor of Choral Studies 
and a conductor at Cal State Fullerton, Rob-
ert’s passion for music has become a fulfilling 
career. This year, Robert won a Grammy 
Award for ‘‘Best Choral Performance’’ for his 
work on the classical piece Mahler Symphony 
Number 8, Symphony of a Thousand. It is the 
first Grammy Award for Robert and his re-
nowned 
choir, 
the 
resident 
chorus 
at 
Segerstrom Center for the Arts. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to, again, for-
mally congratulate Robert Istad on his first

HONORING JOHN WILLIAMS 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor John Williams, 
whom I have named the 5th Congressional 
District’s 2022 Climate Crisis Champion from 
Napa County for his inspiring leadership in 
combatting the climate crisis currently gripping 
our communities. 
Born in Clymer, New York, Mr. Williams 
earned his bachelor’s degree from Cornell 
University 
and 
his 
master’s 
degree 
in 
Oenology from University of California, Davis. 
Mr. Williams founded Frog’s Leap Winery over 
40 years ago, working as a cellar hand at 
Stag’s Leap Winery and Spring Mountain Win-
ery to finance the first vintage of Frog’s Leap 
wine. 
On top of his deep passion for making ex-
cellent wine, Mr. Williams has made Frog’s 
Leap Winery a pioneer of organic viticulture 
practices by abstaining from chemical fer-
tilizers and pesticides, reducing irrigation, and 
installing solar technology. In fact, he brought 
a solar installation to Frog’s Leap before any 
other winery in Napa County, starting a cli-
mate-friendly trend in the industry. 
Mr. Williams participates in various commu-
nity activities that work to combat climate 
change. He is a founding member of the Napa 
Valley Grapegrowers Environment and Cli-
mate Committee and also serves on the orga-
nization’s Industry Issues Committee, which 
works to educate on climate-smart farming 
practices and setting measurable climate ac-
tion goals for the wine industry. He was the 
2020 Porto Protocols Speaker on Climate 
Change and the recipient of the coveted 
‘‘Susty’’ award from the Ecological Farming 
Conference. Mr. Williams has also played a 
major role in the Napa Valley River Restora-
tion project. 
Mr. Williams’ family have only good things 
to say about his amazing climate work and en-
vironmental business practices. John and his 
wife Tori have been married for 12 years, and 
collectively are the proud parents of Rory, 
Kylor, Kelly and Owen and four grandchildren, 
Hal, Alma, Casey and Sophie. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that John Wil-
liams has dedicated his life to combating the 
climate crisis in our communities. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today, to pay tribute to an 
extraordinary sailor, World War II veteran, and 
dedicated civil servant, Mr. Roger H. Spooner, 
who transitioned from labor to reward on 
Thursday, February 24, 2022, at the age of 
99. His funeral service was held on Sunday, 
February 27, 2022, at 3:00 p.m. under the 
‘‘Spooner Oak’’ on Bartow Gibson Highway in 
Seminole County, Georgia. 
Roger Hern Spooner was born November 
18, 1922, as one of eight children to the union 
of Lewis and Delia Spooner. 
In his pursuit of a life outside of farming, 
Roger answered the call to serve his nation 
when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 
of 1941 at the age of 18. After completing 
boot camp, he was sent to the aircraft carrier,

U.S.S. Yorktown, with a destination of Pearl 
Harbor, which had just been bombed. After ar-
riving at Pearl Harbor and witnessing the rem-
nants of damage and lingering smoke from the 
invasion, the crew of 2,500 sailors headed to 
the coast of Australia. In May of 1942, during 
the Battle of the Coral Sea, Roger saw action 
when the U.S.S. Yorktown endured damage, 
and the crew suffered 61 casualties. Following 
the gruesome battle, the carrier and crew re-
turned to the Navy yard at Pearl Harbor for re-
pairs. Once repairs were made, the crew 
made their way to Midway Island to join other 
ships in preparation for the Battle of Midway, 
which took place in June of 1942. Many histo-
rians consider it to be the most important bat-
tle in the Pacific during World War II as it was 
a clash between the U.S. Navy and the Impe-
rial Japanese Navy six months after the attack 
on Pearl Harbor. 
During the Battle of Midway, the U.S.S. 
Yorktown incurred a massive hit beyond re-
pair, and the crew was told to abandon ship. 
One-by-one every crew member went down a 
line into the water with their life preservers into 
water that was so oily that once they were 
covered, you could only see the whites of their 
eyes. After being stranded afloat for a day, 
Roger and his crewmates were rescued. 
Roger served another four years in the 
Navy, where he attended submarine school 
and completed nine war patrols out of Perth, 
Australia. He was later discharged from the 
Navy as a Motor Machinist Mate Second 
Class, after being involved in a motorcycle ac-
cident. Following his military service, he con-
tinued to serve his community and make an 
impact in the lives of others by serving his fel-
low Veterans as a member of the American 
Legion Post 157, Donalsonville. 
In addition to serving, farming, and raising 
his family, Roger also ventured into the truck-
ing industry. He worked for a company for al-
most 18 months before he decided to go into 
trucking for himself in 1948. From there, he 
started his company, Spooner Farms Truck-
ing, LLC. His first truck was a 1940s model 
‘‘gas burner’’ GMC, but over the years, he ac-
quired several Kenworths and Peterbilts. Rog-
er’s sons, David and Dennis; and his grand-
son Jake, joined his trucking business, which 
had as many as seven trucks running and al-
ways transported produce within a 125-mile 
radius of the shop. 
Roger’s love for his wife, his service, and 
his passion remained active until his passing. 
As such, he made sure to renew his licenses 
and maintain the upkeep for his 1999 Peterbilt 
379 affectionately named ‘‘Miss Eloise’’, which 
he used to haul agricultural products, including 
bagged and liquid commodities. The truck’s 
number (CV5) represented the U.S.S. York-
town’s identification number with a 12.7 Detroit 
engine and a 10-speed. 
Mr. Roger H. Spooner lived his life by the 
Golden Rule which states ‘‘Do unto others as 
you would have them do unto you.’’ A man of 
great morals, he demonstrated this principle 
throughout his career and life, outstanding 
achievement, service, and public distinction. 
Our community, our state, and our nation are 
better because of him. 
Roger accomplished much in his life, but 
none of it would have been possible without 
the Grace of God and the love and support of 
his family including his late wife, Eloise; and 
his sons; Roger, Lewis, Thomas, David and 
Dennis; and his grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring the life and legacy 
of Mr. Roger H. Spooner for his remarkable 
service to his community, his nation and to hu-
mankind. Moreover, we extend our deepest 
sympathies to his family, friends, loved ones, 
and all who grieve during this difficult time of 
bereavement. We pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and 
the Holy Spirit in the weeks, months, and 
years ahead.

RECOGNIZING WORLD CIVILITY 
DAY 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great honor and respect that I recognize the 
Community Civility Counts Initiative as the or-
ganization celebrates its annual World Civility 
Day on April 27, 2022, along with the Gary 
Chamber of Commerce, the entire community 
of Northwest Indiana, and beyond. World Civil-
ity Day is a day in which we are asked to be-
come aware of our behavior towards others 
and to become mindful of our thoughts, words, 
and actions. It is a day to remember that we 
can be better people in every aspect of life, 
and to remember that our actions serve as an 
example for generations to come. In observ-
ance of this special event, a day of civility- 
themed activities will be held in Merrillville, In-
diana, at the Dean and Barbara White Com-
munity Center, followed by an awards banquet 
at Avalon Manor. 
In 2015, Chuck Hughes, Executive Director 
of the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and Dr. 
Gordon E. Bradshaw, Chairman of the Public 
Policy Committee, worked together through 
the Gary Chamber to create the Civility 
Counts Initiative. The organization’s mission is 
to build public awareness of civility and to help 
transform communities through positive pro-
grams and relationships. The Initiative works 
to raise the consciousness level of individuals 
and groups of people, as so many of us face 
incidents of disrespect, intolerance, bullying, or 
violence. For striving to make a difference in 
our communities, the organization and its sup-
porters are to be commended. 
This year, the organization welcomes many 
significant and remarkable speakers and 
guests who have worked to promote the pow-
erful message of peace and civility throughout 
their careers, all of whom are truly worthy of 
our sincere admiration. The keynote speaker 
for the ceremony is Robert A. Rohm, Ph.D., 
who has been a noteworthy teacher, principal, 
and director of curriculum development. Dr. 
Rohm is also a very successful author who 
has written over twenty books, including nu-
merous top sellers. In addition, the workshop 
speakers include Reverend Dr. Janette Wil-
son, founder and Executive Director of PUSH 
for Excellence, Inc. and a senior advisor to 
Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr., as well as 
Art Norman, NBC 5 News ambassador and 
Vice President of the National Association of 
Black Journalists. The organization will also 
honor special guest Dr. Clyde Rivers, who is 
the founder and President of IChange Nations 
and an Ambassador-at-Large for the Republic 
of Burundi, Africa. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other 
colleagues to join me in honoring and con-
gratulating the Community Civility Counts Ini-
tiative and in celebrating World Civility Day. 
The significance of this movement will have a 
positive impact for generations to come. For 
their influence, passion, and dedication to the 
community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, 
the leaders and supporters of the Community 
Civility Counts Initiative are worthy of the high-
est praise.

CHIEF BEN MAJETICH 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chief Ben Majetich, who is 
retiring as West Richland’s Police Chief after 
34 years of service to the Tri-Cities. 
Ben came to Central Washington in 1980 
and spent the next 26 years with the Pasco 
Police Department. He worked in multiple 
leadership roles, from street patrol division to 
leading investigations, to being the lead defen-
sive tactics instructor for the city. 
His hard work and dedication did not go un-
noticed, and he was soon promoted to captain 
of West Richland’s Police Department, where 
he would take the lead in developing their 
newly-opened, state-of-the-art facility. 
Chief Majetich truly represents the best of 
Central Washington: a man of courage and 
grit, a man not afraid to roll up his sleeves to 
get the job done. He has proudly served the 
Tri-Cities for 34 years, going above and be-
yond to ensure the safety of our community. 
He is leaving the department in good hands 
with his successor, Captain Thomas Grego, 
but he will certainly be missed. 
I extend my sincerest gratitude to Chief 
Majetich for his leadership and wish him the 
best in his retirement.

HONORING JOSEPH SILVI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Joseph Silvi, 
whom I have named the 5th Congressional 
District’s 2022 Climate Crisis Champion from 
Sonoma County for his inspiring leadership in 
combatting the climate crisis currently gripping 
our communities. 
Joseph was born in Sonoma, California, and 
attended Sonoma Valley High School, from 
which he graduated as valedictorian in 2021. 
While in high school, Joseph participated in 
various extracurriculars, many of which related 
to environmental causes. He was the founder 
and President of Sonoma Valley High School’s 
Campus Beautification Club, which organized 
club workdays to plant trees and flowers, co-
ordinated with the school’s art club to design 
campus murals, and secured funding from 
local charitable organizations. Joseph also

spearheaded the environmental sustainability 
program at Crescent Montessori School in 
Sonoma, implementing several low-cost, re-
generative gardening projects. 
Joseph mentored incoming freshmen stu-
dents at Sonoma Valley High through the 
school’s Link Crew Program, offering them ad-
vice, resources, emotional support, and aca-
demic support. He also volunteered through 
the Interact Club, the socio-civic nonprofit or-
ganization La Luz, First Baptist Church of 
Sonoma, Food for the Hungry, Sonoma Valley 
High’s Wildlife Club, Skiing for Change, and 
Operation Christmas Child. 
Joseph is currently a freshman at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, College of Engi-
neering, where he studies environmental engi-
neering. He is a member of the UC Berkeley 
Biofuels Technology Club and serves in var-
ious roles within the club, such as Club Offi-
cer, Scale-Up Team Lead, and Head of Fuel 
Production. Joseph is integral in the club’s 
work on producing biodiesel from local res-
taurants cooking oil with the goal of eventually 
fueling campus and student vehicles with re-
newable fuel. He is currently leading the gar-
dening and environmental program at the 
Crescent Montessori School of Sonoma, which 
teaches young children about sustainable gar-
dening. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Joseph 
Silvi has dedicated his life to combating the 
climate crisis in our communities. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

IN HONOR OF MIKE CLAFLIN 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mike Claflin on the occasion of 
his retirement as Executive Director of Afford-
able Housing Education & Development Edu-
cation (AHEAD). 
Mike has long been at the forefront of con-
structing affordable housing in New Hamp-
shire’s North Country. It has been an honor to 
work alongside Mike and his team to see so 
many impactful projects come to fruition, like 
the Friendship House and Lloyd’s Hills Apart-
ments in Bethlehem. Mike’s leadership and 
advocacy have delivered more options for 
those suffering from substance abuse dis-
orders as well as countless new housing op-
portunities for working families to a region that 
needs our steadfast support now more than 
ever before. 
I commend Mike on his retirement after 
nearly a decade with AHEAD and on his un-
wavering dedication and commitment to our 
North Country. On behalf of my constituents in 
New Hampshire’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict, I thank Mike for his many years of serv-
ice, and for being a part of what makes the 
Granite State so great. I am honored to recog-
nize and congratulate Mike on his retirement 
and wish him the best of luck in the years 
ahead. 
HONORING LOUISE CALLOWAY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Louise Calloway, Founder 
and Curator of the Underground Railroad Mu-
seum in Burlington County, and a beloved 
member of our community. 
Ms. Calloway has committed her life to serv-
ing others. Prior to founding the Underground 
Railroad Museum, she dedicated 50 years to 
a career in social work and taught college 
courses in Africa. At a young age, preserving 
Black history became a passion that’s grown 
into much more. A history buff at 9 years old, 
she would make scrapbooks using article clip-
pings of African Americans who contributed to 
our local community. 
Despite her first museum closing in 2013, 
Ms. Calloway worked with local groups to re-
open the Underground Railroad Museum in 
Smithville, New Jersey as part of the Bur-
lington County Parks System. The museum of-
fers its visitors a visual experience of the Un-
derground Railroad, highlighting the role free 
African Americans and Quakers played at 16 
different locations across Burlington County in 
helping escaped slaves travel to freedom. She 
hopes that visitors will leave the museum with 
a greater understanding of mankind, our ca-
pacity to be both cruel and kind, and that 
while we may have different skin colors, we all 
belong to one human race. 
I am proud of the role New Jersey and Bur-
lington County have played in preserving and 
uplifting Black History. By focusing on the sto-
ries of individuals like William Allinson, who 
operated Wheatley’s Pharmacy in Burlington 
City, New Jersey as a station on the Under-
ground Railroad, future generations will be 
able to have a connection to the past. Ms. 
Calloway’s remarkable contributions to our 
community personify Burlington County’s slo-
gan, ‘‘The Cradle of Emancipation’’. 
In addition to sharing history, Ms. Calloway 
volunteers at numerous community charities 
and organizations, including the Bethlehem Af-
rican Methodist Episcopal church of Bur-
lington. In 2011, she was recognized by the 
New Jersey Conference of the NAACP for her 
lifetime work as an educator with the Distin-
guished Educators Award. 
I am grateful to Ms. Calloway for her con-
tributions to our community, and I know I 
speak on behalf of my constituents when I say 
her dedication and service are appreciated.

RECOGNITION OF THE ACHIEVE-
MENTS 
OF 
MRS. 
KATHRYN 
MCINNIS 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mrs. Kathryn McInnis of Old Town, Flor-
ida. 
Mrs. McInnis is a pillar in her community 
and a role model for many. A member of mul-
tiple advisory boards, she has dedicated her 
life to serving and improving the lives of oth-
ers. Mrs. McInnis is especially dedicated to 
our youth. She knows firsthand the challenges 
presented in rural communities and has been 
an advocate and mentor to every student she 
has encountered. 
She is an active member with the Dixie 
County Education Foundation and has also 
served on the North Central Florida Regional 
Planning Council. For more than two decades, 
she has served on the Florida Gateway Col-
lege Board of Trustees. Earlier this month, 
Florida Gateway College dedicated a building 
in her honor so that her impact will be remem-
bered for years to come. 
Mrs. McInnis’ heart for serving others is un-
matched, and her energetic spirit is infectious. 
I want to personally thank this incredible 
woman for her contribution to Dixie County 
and Florida’s Second Congressional District as 
a whole.

HONORING JOHN MUIR LAND 
TRUST 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the John Muir 
Land Trust, whom I have named the 5th Con-
gressional 
District’s 
2022 
Climate 
Crisis 
Champion for their inspiring leadership in com-
batting the climate crisis currently gripping our 
communities. 
John Muir Land Trust was founded in 1989 
by residents of Martinez to protect the Alham-
bra Valley Open Space known as Stonehurst. 
Since then, the organization has permanently 
protected over 3,500 acres of natural space to 
be used for passive recreation, wildlife habitat, 
clean drinking water protection, and scenic 
views. The organization’s guiding principle is 
that natural, open spaces are essential to the 
health of our earth, air, water, plants, animals, 
and all of us. 
The organization has taken on many large- 
scale environmental projects in the area, such 
as the addition of Mount Wanda to the John 
Muir National Historical Site, stewardship of 
the Contra Costa Goldfields preserve, the ac-
quisition of Almond Ranch, the merging of 
Franklin Canyon into Fernandez Ranch, the 
public opening of Acalanes Ridge, the cam-
paign to save Carr Ranch and the permanent 
protection of Painted Rock. 
Currently, the organization has partnered 
with the Contra Costa County Flood Control 
District and the East Bay Regional Park Dis-
trict to restore the wildlife habitat and wetland 
activity 
of 
Pacheco 
Marsh 
in 
Martinez. 
Pacheco Marsh is home to ten special-status 
plant and animal species that require pro-
tected land to ensure the continued survival of 
their species. The marsh is planned to be-
come a refuge for migrating birds, spawning 
fish, and the threatened salt-marsh harvest 
mouse. The site will include 2.4 miles of walk-
ing trails, elevated vistas, bird blinds, kayak 
launches, interpretive signs, and an environ-
mental educational facility. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that John Muir 
Land Trust has dedicated its work to com-
bating the climate crisis in our communities for 
the last 30 years. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor the organization and its 
staff here today.

TRIBUTE TO HATTIE DANIELS 
RUSH 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the life and serv-
ice of Commissioner Hattie Daniels Rush, an 
innovator, entrepreneur, business consultant 
and former White House appointed Commis-
sioner to the Commission on Presidential 
Scholars. It saddens me to say that this amaz-
ing community leader passed away on April 
17, 2022. 
Commissioner Rush started her journey as 
a trailblazer when she was just a child. She 
was one of the first African American children 
to attend 35th Street School and began to de-
segregate the Milwaukee Public School Sys-
tem. She did encounter racism and learned to 
confront and mediate such situations. The 
early lessons she experienced as a child 
helped mold her into the strong and inspira-
tional woman she became as an adult. 
Commissioner Rush was a graduate of the 
HBCU Lincoln University in Jefferson City, 
Missouri. She always understood the impor-
tance of education. Commissioner Rush com-
mitted her life to public service, serving as a 
cheerful educator and licensed family therapist 
in the City of Milwaukee for many years. She 
also had a deep commitment to her faith in 
God and served in many roles with her 
church, Holy Redeemer. Her combination of 
skill sets from being a trained teacher and her 
work with the church put her in the perfect po-
sition to help Holy Redeemer open the first Af-
rican American Christian school in the city, 
Holy Redeemer Christian Academy, where 
she served as the school’s Program Director. 
Under the leadership of Commissioner Rush, 
the Holy Redeemer campus expanded to five 
separate schools and a range of social service 
institutions providing impoverished children 
with educational opportunities across Mil-
waukee. 
One of her greatest contributions to this 
community was to cultivate the minds of 
young Black people by teaching them how to 
break down barriers and obstacles to achiev-
ing their goals. President Bush was so im-
pressed with Commissioner Rush’s work that 
he offered her a position in his administration. 
Commissioner Rush accepted a part-time ap-
pointment to the Commission on Presidential 
Scholars so she could continue her work as 
the Program Director for Holy Redeemer 
Schools. 
Hattie Daniels Rush has been my friend 
since kindergarten and a close friend of my 
family. My sister Brenda and I often debated 
who Hattie was most fond of and I had the 
privilege of visiting her before her transition. 
Hattie had a true loving and giving spirit; she 
accepted people as they were and encour-
aged them to be the best they could be. I 
count it all joy to have celebrated 65 years of 
friendship with Hattie Daniels Rush. I will truly 
miss her, and the people of the 4th Congres-
sional District and the State of Wisconsin will 
miss this incredible woman. 
She leaves behind her beloved husband 
and daughter, Robert Rush and Ericka Rush, 
siblings that include Attorney John Daniels, 
Bishop Sedgwick Daniels, Valerie Daniels-Car-
ter and a host of other relatives and friends to 
celebrate her life and enormous legacy of 
strength and determination. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I am 
honored to pay tribute to Commissioner Hattie 
Daniels Rush. She has helped transform the 
lives of so many people. May she rest in 
peace.
