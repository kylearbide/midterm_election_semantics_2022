PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our healer, as we draw aware-
ness this month to defeating the foe 
that is breast cancer, we lay before 
You the friends and loved ones who, 
this day, are coming to terms with a 
recent diagnosis, who are in the throes 
of treatment, or who, by Your grace, 
stand as survivors of this insidious dis-
ease. 
Holy God, You know their names. 
You know that neither young nor old, 
women nor men have been spared the 
terror of this threat. You are keenly 
aware of their journey through the 
shock and denial, the loss and frustra-
tions they have faced along the way. 
Remind them that neither are any 
denied Your abiding presence. Come 
alongside each one and give them cour-
age to face this day. Grant them 
strength when they are sapped of their 
energy. Bestow upon them a sense of 
peace when tempers rage against the 
betrayal of their bodies. And give them 
hope for another day to enjoy the loved 
ones who toil alongside them in this 
battle to live. 
O, great physician, we pray espe-
cially on behalf of those who cannot 
pray for themselves. Heal their souls 
that in all things they will find their 
wholeness in Your love. 
O, Lord, hear our prayers, for heal-
ing, for cures, and in Your mercy, for 
those we have lost. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE led the Pledge of

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF BISHOP PHILLIP BROOKS 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and 
service of Bishop Phillip Brooks, who 
passed away at 88 years old, as the 
First Assistant Presiding Bishop of the 
Church of God in Christ. 
After moving to Michigan in 1949, 
Bishop Brooks became a leader in the 
faith community for Detroit. He was 
also the first African-American pastor 
to broadcast on television in Detroit. 
Bishop Brooks also stressed and 
taught the importance of relationships 
and service within the community. 
The bishop became the supporter of 
several Detroit institutions, including 
the Charles Wright Museum of African 
American History, and he raised money 
and resources to aid displaced New 
York workers after 9/11 and supported 
relief efforts for the victims of Hurri-
cane Katrina. 
His 36 years on the executive board of 
the Church of God in Christ was the 
longest of any bishop. Detroit and the 
faith community will always remember 
Bishop Brooks for his devoted service. 
I take personal privilege to honor his 
spiritual leadership for me and for my 
family, the Cranford family.

TAYLOR 
PATTERSON 
BLAZES 
A 
TRAIL 
FOR IOWA WOMEN 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today as a veteran to recognize 
an amazing achievement of a fellow 
servicewoman in Iowa. 
Last month, Private First Class Tay-
lor Patterson, a student at Iowa State 
University, became the first female en-
listed infantry soldier in the Iowa Na-
tional Guard after being the first Iowa 
woman to complete the rigorous 22- 
week 
training 
program 
at 
Fort 
Benning, Georgia. 
Five years ago, the United States 
Army began to allow women to serve in 
combat positions given that they can 
pass the same base physical require-
ment 
for 
all 
combat 
personnel. 
Through determination and the sup-
port of her family and team at Fort 
Benning, Private First Class Patterson 
blazed a trail for generations of Iowa 
women. 
For over 183 years, the Iowa National 
Guard has been an excellent example of 
service above self by always answering 
their call to duty. Whether it is assist-
ing communities in disaster relief ef-
forts, like we saw with last year’s dere-
cho in Iowa, or being deployed to Af-
ghanistan this year to aid in the ref-
ugee crisis, Iowa’s National Guard has 
always gone above and beyond in their 
service to our State and our country. 
Congratulations 
to 
Private 
First 
Class Patterson for her service and for 
being a trailblazer for women every-
where.

STRIKING WORKERS PUT THEIR 
LIVES ON THE LINE 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the United Autoworkers on 
strike at John Deere and to express my 
heartfelt condolences for a devastating 
loss. 
We woke up to tragic news this 
morning that a worker in Milan, Illi-
nois, was crossing the street by the 
picket line and was struck and killed. 
This is heartbreaking. He was just 
described to me as a quiet and kind 
person, the type of guy who would 
make you laugh. 
My prayers are with his family and 
with all of the striking UAW workers 
today. 
These workers have put their lives on 
the line in more ways than one. At the 
height of the pandemic, Deere employ-
ees in the district that I serve were 
deemed essential, even making thou-
sands of anti-COVID face shields that 
Deere donated to help keep others safe. 
They were working 10- and 12-hour 
shifts. 
John Deere is an iconic, homegrown 
American company, part of the fabric 
of the community where I live. When a 
business is as successful as Deere & 
Company, they need to make sure that 
their workers are rewarded for that, 
they are key to that success. These 
workers have earned a fair deal. 
I have faith in John Deere, and I 
stand with our UAW workers. 
f 
GAIN OF DYSFUNCTION IN 
WASHINGTON 
(Mr. LONG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, you hear a 
lot today about the gain of dysfunction 
research. 
Gain of dysfunction research is going 
on right here in Washington, D.C., and 
I say it is time we put a stop to it. This 
gain of dysfunction research leads us to 
all kinds of problems in our country 
that we weren’t facing before January 
3 of this year and most definitely be-
fore January 20 of this year. 
Our friends across the aisle have pro-
posed $5.5 trillion in new spending, $2.1 
trillion in new tax increases, the high-
est level of spending and highest level 
of tax increases in history. 
Now, they can say no one under 
$400,000 has to pay these new taxes, but 
through the dysfunction of Congress 
and the White House, this gain of dys-
function research must stop. 
People under $400,000 are paying 42.1 
percent more for gas. It is kind of a 
status symbol today to be able to fill 
your tank up with gas. 
Gas utilities are up 20.6 percent. I 
only wish in my hometown that is all 
we were going to face this winter. Pro-
pane, kerosene, firewood are up 27 per-
cent. 
The energy crisis, national average 
for gas up to $3.38. 
And not to mention the dysfunction 
going on at our border, the worst bor-
der crisis in 30 years, 192,000 in appre-
hensions. 
I say it is time to end the state of 
dysfunction in Washington, D.C. re-
search. 
f 
HONORING THE HEROISM OF 
ARISTIDES DE SOUSA MENDES 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a 
Portuguese diplomat and hero who sin-
glehandedly saved tens of thousands of 
lives of people fleeing the Nazi persecu-
tion in 1940. 
On October 19, 2021, Sousa Mendes 
was laid to rest in the National Pan-
theon in Lisbon, Portugal. 
He was proudly Portuguese and had a 
deep love of country, family, and the 
arts. He served as the Portuguese con-
sulate general in Bordeaux, France, in 
1940. 
When Hitler launched his invasion of 
France on May 10, 1940, millions of peo-
ple suddenly found themselves in im-
minent danger from Nazi attack. 
Thousands sought visas in the con-
sulate in Bordeaux trying to escape. In 
June of 1940, Sousa Mendes issued an 
estimated 30,000 visas, including to 
roughly 10,000 Jews fleeing for their 
lives with their families, despite the 
Salazar regime having forbidden their 
diplomats in Portugal from issuing 
such visas to refugees. 
The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer 
cited Sousa Mendes’ actions as perhaps 
the largest rescue action by a single in-
dividual during the Holocaust. 
As a punishment for disobeying the 
mandates of his country’s Salazar re-
gime, Sousa Mendes was stripped of his 
job, denied a pension, and pushed into 
poverty. His home was repossessed, and 
he suffered two strokes before passing 
away in 1954. 
‘‘I may have erred,’’ he wrote, ‘‘but if 
so, I did it unintentionally, having fol-
lowed the voice of my conscience, 
which . . . never failed to guide me in 
the fulfillment of my duties, in full 
awareness of my responsibilities.’’ 
After years without recognition for 
his heroism, I commend the decision to 
lay Sousa Mendes to rest in the Na-
tional Pantheon, celebrating his cour-
age. 
Please join me in honoring Aristides 
de Sousa Mendes. 
f 
STOP THE RECKLESS SPENDING 
SPREE 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, the 
cost of living keeps getting more ex-
pensive, and we are reminded of that 
every time we fill up our cars and 
trucks. Gasoline prices, at a 7-year 
high, are putting a strain on family 
budgets. 
When asked about surging gas prices, 
President Biden said, ‘‘I don’t have a 
near-term solution.’’ Well, Republicans 
do, with bills languishing in com-
mittee. His lack of solutions is of little 
comfort to struggling families. 
Meanwhile, the President’s $5 trillion 
tax-and-spending plan advances ex-
treme policies that will increase con-
sumer costs and undermine American 
energy. That includes imposing a new 
tax on home heating bills, as well as an 
arbitrary drilling moratorium on Fed-
eral lands. 
Banning domestic energy production 
will only increase reliance on foreign 
energy sources, and motorists every-
where will pay with higher prices at 
the pump. 
Let’s stop this reckless spending 
spree and attack on American energy 
before it is too late. 
f 
DEMOCRATS MAKING 
TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, while 
in my district a few weeks ago, I spoke 
with my constituents about the Demo-
cratic Party’s plan to build our coun-
try back better after the pandemic. 
The people of the Virgin Islands 
agree with me that we have reached an 
inflection point. This is our moment to 
prove to the American people that 
their government works for the people, 
not just those at the top. 
As President Biden always said, we 
need to reward work in this country, 
not just wealth. Build Back Better 
means creating millions of jobs while 
tackling the climate crisis and ensur-
ing that America will not only compete 
but lead the way to the clean energy 
future. Meanwhile, its transformative 
investments in women and families— 
including childcare, paid leave, home- 
based care, and universal pre-K—will 
unlock the full economic potential of 
parents in the workforce. It also in-
cludes historic investment in work-
force training, to connect workers to 
jobs. 
Democrats have already made sure 40 
million American families received a 
tax cut through the Biden child tax 
credit, which is helping cut child pov-
erty in half. Build Back Better doubles 
down on those investments, resulting 
in one of the largest middle-class tax 
cuts ever. This is our opportunity to 
build back better.

INFLATION IS ONGOING

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5937 
October 27, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, sadly the Biden inflation is 
ongoing, and families are struggling to 
survive as jobs are being destroyed. 
Last month I shared the Labor De-
partment report the Consumer Price 
Index for August was rising at the fast-
est pace in 13 years. This continued in 
September, and here are a few price in-
crease examples: gasoline up 42.1 per-
cent; gas utilities up 20.6 percent; 
bacon up 19.3 percent; eggs up 12.6 per-
cent; children’s shoes up 11.9 percent; 
fresh fish and seafood up 10.7 percent. 
Biden tax-and-spend policies cause 
inflation and destroy jobs. Clearly, the 
Democrat elite think they are smarter 
than anyone with the Democrat voters 
they see as ignorant making a claim 
that $3.5 trillion will have zero costs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues, moving from Afghanistan to 
America. 
f 
AN URGENT NEED FOR ACTION IN 
THE CENTRAL VALLEY 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, in the 
midst of a statewide drought emer-
gency, the Central Valley experienced 
considerable rainstorms this week. 
While communities across my dis-
trict are incredibly grateful for this 
rainfall, we know this relief will be 
short lived. 
Farmers are desperate for water to 
grow their crops. Rural towns continue 
to face water shortages. 
We are grateful for this rain. We need 
this rain. But we need this administra-
tion to understand the dire nature of 
our situation and take appropriate 
measures to capture our most precious 
resource. 
I have asked time and time again for 
support from the House majority to ad-
dress this issue. 
I have expressed the urgent need for 
action to prepare for exactly the oppor-
tunity that has been pointlessly wasted 
this week. 
The families in my district cannot 
continue to wait. I ask my colleagues 
yet again to join my efforts to improve 
water infrastructure and water man-
agement in California. 
f 
NUCLEAR FAMILIES SHOULD NOT 
BE PUNISHED 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to talk one more time about 
the reconciliation bill that may be be-
fore us very soon. 
We began this session with a great 
electoral victory for Black Lives Mat-
ter, who on their website said we dis-
rupt the western prescribed nuclear 
family structure. 
First of all, I think that is just in-
sulting because we have nuclear fami-
lies all over the world. But in any 
event, I look at the reconciliation bill 
that is now before us, and it looks to 
me like a payoff to people who want to 
discriminate against the nuclear fam-
ily. 
Whether you look at the earned in-
come tax credit, all the additional 
money in low-income housing, or the 
increase in Pell grants, they are all ad-
ditional money that will be dispropor-
tionately very difficult for nuclear 
families to access. 
I strongly reject voting for this bill 
because in the future we must no 
longer punish people who decide to live 
in nuclear families. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN MUST ACT TO 
AVERT AN IMPENDING ENERGY 
CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, this fall 
along with the cooler temperatures 
that 
autumn 
always 
brings, 
Ten-
nesseans and Americans all across the 
country will be subjected to record- 
breaking prices to heat our homes. 
Under 
the 
Biden 
administration, 
costs for natural gas, the most com-
mon resource for heating our homes, 
has skyrocketed. 
With inflation at a 30-year high, fam-
ilies are already stretched thin as they 
pay more at the grocery store and at 
the gas pump, but it doesn’t stop there. 
Families are now expected to pay 
more in energy costs to heat their 
homes; as much as 54 percent for some 
households for the fall and winter 
months. 
Rather than confronting this bur-
geoning energy crisis before it is too 
late, President Biden and Democrats 
are proposing disastrous energy poli-
cies that are bad for the economy, bad 
for the national security, and bad for 
Americans. 
Included in their more than $5 tril-
lion social spending agenda is a natural 
gas tax and bans on domestic energy 
and mineral production, which will 
cause us to obtain these vital resources 
from OPEC, Russia, and even China. 
As Democrats continued to push 
their 
tax-and-spend 
agenda, 
it 
is 
middle- and low-income families who 
will be hit the hardest by far left en-
ergy policies. 
President Biden must act now to 
avert this impending energy crisis. 
f 
HONORING JARED KEYWORTH 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an American hero. 
Jared Keyworth from Mandeville, Lou-
isiana, served as a senior inspector 
with the United States Marshals Serv-
ice and tragically lost his life in the 
line of duty earlier this month. 
Senior Inspector Keyworth began his 
service with the Marshals Service in 
2010 and took on assignments in Den-
ver, Miami, and New Orleans. Most re-
cently, he was selected to serve in the 
marshals’ technical operations group 
in Baton Rouge. 
Prior to Jared’s service with the 
marshals, he served in the United 
States 
Army’s 
Old 
Guard. 
During 
President Reagan’s funeral, Jared es-
corted the riderless horse, the symbol 
of a fallen leader who will never ride 
again. 
On September 28 of 2021, Jared was 
critically wounded while in pursuit of a 
violent felony offender. He passed away 
on October 1. 
Jared will forever be in our hearts 
and minds, and we are eternally grate-
ful for his service to our great country.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) and the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
The COVID–19 pandemic hit all of our 
communities hard, but for vulnerable 
youth in foster care, it was terrifying, 
especially for those youth approaching 
the age of independence at which they 
lose access to the supports that foster 
care provides. 
When my good friend Congresswoman 
JACKIE WALORSKI and I teamed up last 
year to provide States with flexibility 
and funding to help these youth, we 
hoped and expected that the pandemic 
would be over by now and that these 
youth would be back on track, getting 
an education, starting jobs, finding a 
place to live, and establishing inde-
pendent lives. 
Unfortunately, the delta variant hit 
hard, creating a new wave of challenges 
for these youth. To the current and 
former foster youth who reached out to 
us and our colleagues to share their 
stories, we hear you, and we are com-
mitted to continuing to respect the les-
sons of your lived experience in foster 
care. 
The legislation we are considering 
today, the Continued State Flexibility 
To Assist Older Foster Youth Act will 
restore and continue key program 
flexibilities that allow States to pro-
vide greater stability and certainty to 
current and former youth via the John 
H. Chafee Foster Care Independence 
Program. 
The bill will give States the flexi-
bility to continue providing the spe-
cific supports that older foster youth 
need to return to college, training pro-
grams, and work. It will extend flexi-
bilities to secure housing, to gain inde-
pendence through driving programs, 
and to allow youth who would other-
wise age out of eligibility for services a 
little more support to weather the pan-
demic. 
I firmly believe in the strong bipar-
tisan partnership that Representative 
WALORSKI and I have built over the 
years to help vulnerable youth and 
families to improve our child welfare 
system. 
We have a lot to do to help foster 
youth through this pandemic, and this 
legislation to allow States to make 
better use of the funding we provided is 
the first step. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this important legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I rise today in support of H.R. 
5661, the Continued State Flexibility 
To Assist Older Foster Youth Act. 
America’s most vulnerable foster 
youth face unique challenges even in 
normal times, and the COVID–19 pan-
demic created even more obstacles to 
overcome. 
Nearly 20,000 youth age out of foster 
care every year. While the COVID pan-
demic has presented difficulties for all 
Americans, foster youth and former 
foster youth are particularly vulner-
able, given that they are most likely to 
be without reliable adults and other 
kinds of supports in their lives. 
The Continued State Flexibility To 
Assist Older Foster Youth Act would 
allow States to keep in place impor-
tant flexibilities in the Chafee child 
welfare program so they can continue 
to support vulnerable foster youth in 
Indiana and across the country. 
I am grateful to Chairman DAVIS for 
his continued partnership in building 
on our past reforms to help families 
thrive and this committee’s tradition 
of bipartisan action to protect young 
people in our foster care system. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 5661, the Continued 
State Flexibility To Assist Older Fos-
ter Youth Act. 
We have heard directly from foster 
youth that aging out of the system 
comes with unique challenges, and that 
they are often left without supportive 
services or families to help them if 
they fall on hard times. This has been 
especially 
difficult 
throughout 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
as 
older 
and 
former foster youth have experienced 
homeless, been laid off from work, en-
dured food insecurity, and navigated 
negative 
impacts 
on 
their 
mental 
health. 
But States like California have de-
vised ways to help, like letting foster 
youth who turn 21 continue receiving 
support and assistance through the 
child welfare agency. Additionally, at 
the end of last year, Congress provided 
States with additional funds in the 
year-end omnibus specifically to help 
this population, many of whom were 
not eligible for Federal stimulus pay-
ments. And in California, we are work-
ing to get this funding directly to im-
pacted youth via direct cash payments. 
Unfortunately, the pandemic has made 
it harder to get these funds directly 
into the hands of the young people who 
need them, causing needless delays and 
hardship. 
That is why I am happy to support 
H.R. 5661 to extend support to our 
young adults and ensure that they have 
all of the tools they need to make it 
through this unprecedented time. By 
extending the programmatic flexibili-
ties in the Chafee program, which helps 
current and former foster youth pre-
pare for independent adult living, we 
are keeping young people safe and 
housed and also ensuring access to sup-
portive services for those youth af-
fected by the COVID–19 crisis. 
I have had the privilege to meet with 
foster youth from across the country 
throughout the years, and I have been 
impressed with their resilience and 
ability to advocate for themselves. But 
they don’t have to do it alone. I am 
proud to support this bill to help foster 
youth shape a better future for them-
selves and our whole country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support

that aged out of the system are hurting 
and feel forgotten. We can come to-
gether to support these youth through 
continuing States’ flexibility with the 
Chafee funds to assist older foster 
youth. 
The act will allow the emergency 
Chafee funds flexibilities that we im-
plemented during the pandemic to con-
tinue through fiscal year 2022. It will 
give youth the option to reenter foster 
care that aged out during the pan-
demic, remove the living expenses cap, 
and expand the educational training 
funds to assist them. 
We hear more and more from youth 
that need our help. As a foster-to-adopt 
parent, I know that our foster youth 
need our help, and we need to make 
sure that we hold to our responsibility 
to fully support them during this cri-
sis. Young adults who have aged out of 
foster care are the number one risk for 
homelessness in that age group. 
Mr. Speaker, we have the oppor-
tunity here to make a difference. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the chairman so very much 
for yielding to me. I thank him and 
Ranking Member WALORSKI for bring-
ing this bill forward. 
Mr. Speaker, our foster youth are, of 
course, some of our Nation’s most vul-
nerable. But do you know what? They 
are also our most resilient. But even 
the most resilient needs support. That 
is what this bill is all about, ensuring 
that those who would otherwise age 
out of foster care at age 18, who chose 
it or need it, can continue to get serv-
ices—housing, workforce development, 
driving skills—through this pandemic. 
For thousands of foster youth each 
year, their time in foster care, simply 
because they turn 18—or 21 in some 
States—can be a very, very unsettling 
moment for them. 
As a result, with little or no family 
support, they suddenly find themselves 
grown, independent. But the reality is 
that the battle is only beginning in 
these youths’ lives. Having already suf-
fered trauma, including family separa-
tion, they find themselves without any 
type of safety net during this particu-
larly trying time in any person’s life. 
And to be sure, these are inspiring 
young people, but again, they need sup-
port to help ensure brighter futures. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about 
one of these youth who I had the pleas-
ure to get to know. His story is full of 
struggles and victories, but they are 
not 
the 
exception. 
This 
was 
Mr. 
‘‘DJay’’ Joi. 
I first met DJay when he shadowed 
me during Foster Youth Day a few 
years ago. He had such a great heart, 
great 
personality, 
extremely 
intel-
ligent, that he quickly became a part 
of my own personal family. 
DJay’s drive and resilience helped 
him create a bright future for himself. 
He knew firsthand the difficulties fac-
ing those aging out of the foster care 
system, challenges that he shared with 
me. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, this bill is a good step. But let’s rec-
ognize and address the supports we 
need to provide foster youth. We need 
to require all States to raise the max-
imum age to 21 for those who choose to 
keep receiving foster care supportive 
services. We need to think about per-
manently removing the barriers or the 
cap on the use of Chafee funds for hous-
ing. 
KAREN BASS and I have a bill that 
would immediately allow former foster 
youth 
to 
keep 
Medicaid 
coverage 
through age 26. Healthcare is a critical 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
and the ranking member, and I urge all 
Members to support this great initia-
tive. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 5661, the Con-
tinued State Flexibility To Assist 
Older Foster Youth Act. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Cau-
cus on Foster Youth, this issue is in-
credibly important to me. In my home 
State of Michigan, there are approxi-
mately 13,000 children in foster care. 
Unfortunately, they have been at par-
ticular risk during this COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
This legislation would take meaning-
ful action to ensure that States have 
the opportunity to assist children in 
foster care by extending pandemic-re-
lated provisions passed under the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act for an ad-
ditional year. 
Mr. Speaker, I am confident that 
these flexibilities will help States, like 
my own Michigan, provide foster chil-
dren with the assistance they need. 
We must do everything in our power 
to assist and support at-risk youth. It 
is necessary that we follow through on 
this commitment to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I often remind people: 
Foster children are a ward of the State 
and are our responsibility. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Continued State Flexibility To 
Assist Older Foster Youth Act. 
Last month, I hosted a townhall with 
the National Foster Youth Institute 
for current and former foster youth 
across the country. Their stories of 
hardship broke my heart. I was not sur-
prised, though, because these young 
people are among the most vulnerable 
in our society, often lacking the same 
social safety net that you or I could 
rely on in a crisis. 
Surveys throughout the pandemic 
have shown foster youth face elevated 
financial, housing, and food insecurity; 
decreased educational and workforce 
participation; and increased isolation. 
This bill before us today extends cru-
cial flexibilities for the Chafee Foster 
Care Program that we put in place last 
December, allowing States to better 
meet the needs of current and former 
foster youth. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill and help young people 
access this much-needed assistance. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers. 
I will simply say that I am very 
pleased that we are considering this 
important legislation that would pro-
vide additional help to foster children 
and give States the flexibility that 
they need to provide all the assistance 
during this pandemic that foster chil-
dren can make use of. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking 
member tremendously for the biparti-
sanship we have been able to effect, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in December, we worked 
together to take action to help foster 
youth through the pandemic so they 
could build a stronger, more stable fu-
ture. That bill, called the Supporting 
Foster Youth Through the Pandemic 
Act, provided much-needed additional 
support for foster youth and families, 
at-risk pregnant women and mothers, 
and 
kinship 
caregivers, 
including 
grandparents. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill included $400 
million in funding to assist States in 
supporting foster youth transitioning 
to adulthood during the pandemic. 
That relief has provided a lifeline for 
thousands of youth to get back to 
school, back into jobs, and on the path 
of self-sufficiency. 
As COVID–19 continues to spur insta-
bility, young people with experience in 
foster care still face significant chal-
lenges to meet their basic needs and to 
access critical funds and services. 
According to the Department of 
Health and Human Services, 75 percent 
of these funds remain unobligated by 
States as of September 30, 2021, and 
States have another year to spend. In 
recognition of the needs of foster 
youth, this bill would extend those key 
programmatic flexibilities for another 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these vulnerable foster youth 
by voting for H.R. 5661, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

5661. 
The question was taken; and (two-

f 
REAL JUSTICE FOR OUR 
VETERANS ACT OF 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4035) to amend the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 
1968 to prioritize veterans court treat-
ment programs that ensure equal ac-
cess for racial and ethnic minorities 
and women, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4035 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Real Justice for 
Our Veterans Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. EQUAL ACCESS TO VETERANS COURT 
TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR RACIAL 
AND 
ETHNIC 
MINORITIES 
AND 
WOMEN. 
Section 2991(i)(2) of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 
10651(i)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(C) REPORT.—Not later than 3 years after 
the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the 
Attorney General shall submit to Congress a re-
port on the effectiveness of veterans treatment 
court programs. In preparing such a report, the 
Attorney General shall conduct a national 
multi-site evaluation of such programs, includ-
ing an assessment of— 
‘‘(i) the population served by such programs; 
‘‘(ii) whether such programs use evidence- 
based treatments for substance use and mental 
health, including medication for addiction treat-
ment; 
‘‘(iii) recidivism rates of participants in such 
programs; 
‘‘(iv) program completion rates; and 
‘‘(v) whether racial and ethnic minorities and 
women have equal access to such programs and 
an equal opportunity to complete such pro-
grams, including by collecting and analyzing 
data related to admission in such programs and 
completion of such programs, to ensure there are 
not disparities related to race, ethnicity, or 
sex.’’. 
SEC. 3. VETERANS PILOT PROGRAM ON PROM-
ISING RETENTION MODELS. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Attorney General, 
acting through the Director of the Bureau of 
Justice Assistance, shall carry out a pilot pro-
gram to make grants to eligible units of local 
government to improve retention in veterans 
treatment court programs (as such term is de-
fined in section 2991 of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 
10651)) and drug court programs. 
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—In order to be eligible for a 
grant under subsection (a), a unit of local gov-
ernment shall operate a veterans treatment 
court program or a drug court. 
(c) APPLICATION.—A unit of local government 
seeking a grant through the pilot program under 
subsection (a) shall submit to the Attorney Gen-
eral an application at such time, in such man-
ner, and containing such information as the At-
torney General may reasonably require, includ-
ing— 
(1) a description of the therapeutic or treat-
ment modality that the unit of local government 
plans to implement and data to support the use 
of the therapeutic or treatment modality, in-
cluding information showing how the thera-
peutic or treatment modality will promote reten-
tion in and completion of veterans treatment 
court programs and drug court programs; and 
(2) detailed plans on how the applicant would 
test the efficacy of the therapeutic or treatment 
modality. 
(d) REPORTING METRICS.—Not later than 180 
days after receiving a grant under subsection 
(a), a unit of local government shall submit to 
the Attorney General a report, which includes 
demographic information of participants in the 
veterans treatment court program, and comple-
tion rates of such participants. The Attorney 
General shall develop guidelines for the report 
required under this subsection. 
(e) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
There is authorized to be appropriated $3,000,000 
for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2027 to 
carry out this section. 
SEC. 4. ADMISSION OF VETERANS TO DRUG 
COURTS. 
In the case of a jurisdiction that does not op-
erate a veterans treatment court program (as 
such term is defined in section 2991 of the Omni-
bus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 
(34 U.S.C. 10651)), but that does operate a drug 
court under part EE of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10611 
et seq.), a veteran who would be eligible to par-
ticipate in a veterans treatment court program 
may participate in the drug court, including a 
veteran who is a violent offender (as such term 
is defined in section 2953(a) of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 
U.S.C. 10613(a))). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor 
and proud of H.R. 4035. The Real Jus-
tice for Our Veterans Act is before the 
House for consideration, and I ask all 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan bill today. 
I authored the Real Justice for Our 
Veterans Act to help our Nation’s jus-
tice-involved veterans to improve the 
delivery of services in veterans and 
drug courts. The bill before the House 
today has three discrete aims. 
First, the bill would expand data col-
lection regarding the effectiveness of 
veterans courts. 
Second, it authorizes a pilot program 
that would investigate and promote 
promising retention models in veterans 
and drug courts. 
Lastly, and perhaps most critically, 
it would open up drug treatment courts 
to veterans in areas where there may 
not be a veterans court, so very impor-
tant for those who have interacted 
with our committee and have made 
note of the fact that there are many ju-
risdictions in the United States where 
there are veterans and no veterans 
court. 
Each of these critical changes would 
promote higher participation and high-
er rehabilitation of veterans who have 
mental health and substance abuse 
issues. 
The need for this legislation is pain-
fully clear. Generations of veterans 
have served abroad in recent decades, 
and we must redouble our efforts to 
support veterans and expand the serv-
ices they need to thrive. 
The rapid expansion of veterans 
treatment courts speaks not only to 
the need for such courts but, more im-
portantly, to the benefit of the special-
ized approach to rehabilitation and 
treatment the courts offer. 
The holistic treatment model, which 
includes input from the prosecutor, de-
fense counsel, and the court, centers on 
the supervised comprehensive treat-
ment provided by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs or community organi-
zations. 
Because each veterans court offers 
different 
management 
services, 
we 
need to do more to identify which 
treatment options are successful so 
that these promising models can be ex-
panded. That is why the elements of 
the Real Justice for Our Veterans Act 
are so important. 
The bill also calls for additional data 
on the demographics of who is referred 
to veterans treatment courts and asks 
for information on completion rates. 
This information will be critical to ad-
vancing our understanding of how the 
programs are used. 
Additionally, the legislation author-
izes a new pilot program that will 
allow DOJ to test promising retention 
programs that promote greater enroll-
ment and participation by veterans 
through the duration of their treat-
ment program. 
b 1245 
Legislative efforts to strengthen vet-
erans treatment courts have yielded bi-
partisan support in the past, and the 
same is true today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTH-
ERFORD), for cosponsoring the bill and 
working with me in this effort. 
I urge my colleagues to take a look 
at their congressional districts. You 
will probably find places of refuge for 
our veterans; some may be homeless. I 
have several facilities in my congres-
sional district that deal with the hous-
ing of homeless veterans, or deal with 
services for homeless veterans, or deal 
with services, period, for veterans. 
I can assure you that a comforting 
judicial system on veterans who, be-
cause of combat injuries, PTSD, and

other issues dealing with them, losing 
their family, being separated from the 
family, being miles away from their 
home because of combat-impacted inju-
ries, that the judicial system is one 
they may come in contact with. 
To be able to have courts that are re-
sponsive to their service and their 
record, and to be able to help move 
them away from the judicial system is 
a tribute to our commitment to the 
service of our men and women. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
continue this record of support for vet-
erans treatment courts by voting for 
this bill today. 
I am proud that H.R. 4035, the ‘‘Real Jus-
tice for Our Veterans Act’’ is before the House 
for consideration and I ask all my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan bill today. 
I authored the Real Justice for Our Veterans 
Act to help our nation’s justice-involved vet-
erans and to improve the delivery of services 
in veterans and drug courts. 
The bill before the House today has three 
discrete aims. 
First, the bill would expand data collection 
regarding the effectiveness of veterans courts. 
Second, it authorizes a pilot program that 
would investigate and promote promising re-
tention models in veterans and drug courts. 
And lastly, and perhaps most critically, it 
would open up drug treatment courts to vet-
erans in areas where there may not be a vet-
erans court. 
Each of these critical changes would pro-
mote higher participation and higher rehabilita-
tion of veterans who have mental health and 
substance abuse issues. 
The need for this legislation is painfully 
clear. Generations of veterans have served 
abroad in recent decades and we must redou-
ble our efforts to support veterans and expand 
the services they need to thrive. 
The rapid expansion of veterans treatment 
courts speaks not only to the need for such 
courts but more importantly to the benefit of 
the specialized approach to rehabilitation and 
treatment the courts offer. 
The wholistic treatment model, which in-
cludes input from the prosecutor, defense 
counsel, and the court, centers on the super-
vised comprehensive treatment provided by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs or commu-
nity organizations. 
Because each veterans court offers different 
treatment services, we need to do more to 
identify which treatment options are successful 
so that these promising models can be ex-
panded. 
That’s why these elements of the ‘‘Real Jus-
tice for Our Veterans Act’’ are so important. 
The bill also calls for additional data collec-
tion on the demographics of who is referred to 
veterans treatment courts and asks for infor-
mation on completion rates. This information 
will be critical to advancing our understanding 
of how the programs are used. 
Additionally, the legislation authorizes a new 
pilot program that will allow DOJ to test prom-
ising retention programs that promote greater 
enrollment 
and 
participation 
by 
veterans 
through the duration of their treatment pro-
gram. 
Legislative efforts to strengthen veterans 
treatment courts have yielded bipartisan sup-
port in the past, and the same is true today. 
I thank our colleague, the gentleman from 
Florida, Representative JOHN RUTHERFORD, for 
cosponsoring this bill and working with me in 
this effort. 
I urge my colleagues to continue this record 
of support for veterans treatment courts by 
voting for this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4035, the Real Justice for Our Veterans 
Act of 2021. 
Unfortunately, many of our Nation’s 
veterans suffer from substance abuse 
disorders, mental health conditions, 
and trauma. According to data from 
the Department of Justice’s Bureau of 
Justice Statistics, approximately 60 
percent of combat veterans in our Na-
tion’s prisons have reported mental 
health disorders. 
Veterans treatment court programs 
are modeled after other specialized 
treatment court programs, such as 
drug treatment courts to provide serv-
ices specific to meet the unique needs 
of veterans. Veterans treatment courts 
are not only designed to benefit vet-
erans in the criminal justice system, 
but taxpayers as well. 
These treatment programs lower re-
cidivism for participants who complete 
them, saving money that otherwise 
would have been spent on incarcer-
ation. 
H.R. 4035 will expand data collection 
on these treatment programs to ensure 
that our veterans are getting the most 
effective treatment possible. 
H.R. 4035 also authorizes pilot pro-
grams to make grants to improve re-
tention rates in veterans treatment 
court programs. It allows veterans in 
jurisdictions that do not operate vet-
erans court programs to participate in 
drug courts instead. 
Congress must do everything in its 
power to protect our Nation’s veterans 
and ensure that they get the very best 
treatment. This is exactly what this 
bill does. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
MR. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 16 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this has been a journey 
for me in terms of dealing with vet-
erans who are in need of help. 
Some years ago, I joined with the 
late and former member of the mili-
tary, Chairman Murtha, to bring a sat-
ellite site to my congressional district 
for post-traumatic stress disorder. The 
center was outside of the veterans hos-
pital but could be accessed by veterans 
through TRICARE. 
So I have seen the needs of veterans 
who have experienced the impact of 
combat, the impact of the service, but 
are still committed to duty. This par-
ticular legislation responds and re-
spects that duty. That is the duty that 
we owe to those who have fallen along 
the highway of challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure 
that we have the treatment for those 
who have experienced substance abuse, 
as well as that we have the judicial 
system that responds to that need. It 
may cross the gamut of substance 
abuse, alcohol abuse, and of course, en-
counters with the criminal justice sys-
tem. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man NADLER
of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. And I thank members of the 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Secu-
rity Subcommittee because it shows 
that our work is expansive. It includes 
rehabilitation and treatment and fair-
ness and justice. Finding ways to have 
people steer away from incarceration 
and, of course, encounters over and 
over again with the judicial system or 
the criminal justice system. 
So veterans treatment court pro-
grams around the country have suc-
cessfully provided support to veterans 
struggling with substance abuse or 
mental health issues. We have seen 
them work effectively. The need to ex-
pand veterans treatment court services 
is real and immediate. 
We look forward to this bill moving 
in the other body and the President of 
the United States signing it, saying to 
veterans, we want to be helpful to you 
in your time of celebration of who you 
are as a veteran, but also in your time 
of need. 
Based on the most recent data, the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates 
that approximately 181,500 veterans are 
incarcerated in jail as well as State 
and Federal prisons. Mr. Speaker, that 
is too many who have been lost to the 
abusing of drugs, alcohol, and sub-
stance abuse. 
H.R. 4035 would help rehabilitate jus-
tice-involved veterans and ultimately 
make for a safer community and give 
them a better quality of life; and might 
I say, give their families a better qual-
ity of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of this im-
portant bill. 
Mr. Speaker, veterans treatment court pro-
grams around the country have successfully 
provided support to veterans struggling with 
substance abuse or mental health issues. 
The need to expand veterans treatment 
court services is real and immediate.

mately 181,500 veterans are incarcerated in 
jails as well as state and federal prisons. 
H.R. 4035 would help rehabilitate justice-in-
volved veterans and ultimately make for safer 
communities. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in 
favor of this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5942 
October 27, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4035, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
JAIME 
ZAPATA 
AND 
VICTOR 
AVILA FEDERAL OFFICERS AND 
EMPLOYEES PROTECTION ACT 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 921) to amend title 18, United 
States Code, to further protect officers 
and employees of the United States, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 921 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jaime Za-
pata and Victor Avila Federal Officers and 
Employees Protection Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) since the founding of the Nation, offi-
cers and employees of the United States Gov-
ernment have dutifully and faithfully served 
the United States overseas, including in situ-
ations that place them at serious risk of 
death or bodily harm, in order to preserve, 
protect, and defend the interests of the 
United States; 
(2) securing the safety of such officers and 
employees while serving overseas is of para-
mount importance and is also in furtherance 
of preserving, protecting, and defending the 
interests of the United States; 
(3) Federal courts, including the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
cuit, the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit, and the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, 
have correctly interpreted section 1114 of 
title 18, United States Code, to apply 
extraterritorially to protect officers and em-
ployees of the United States while the offi-
cers and employees are serving abroad; 
(4) in a case involving a violent attack 
against Federal law enforcement officers 
Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila, a panel of a 
Federal court of appeals held that section 
1114 of title 18, United States Code, does not 
apply extraterritorially, creating a split 
among the United States circuit courts of 
appeals; 
(5) in light of the opinion described in para-
graph (4), it has become necessary for Con-
gress to clarify the original intent that sec-
tion 1114 of title 18, United States Code, ap-
plies extraterritorially; and 
(6) it is further appropriate to clarify the 
original intent that sections 111 and 115 of 
title 
18, 
United 
States 
Code, 
apply 
extraterritorially as well. 
SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOY-
EES OF THE UNITED STATES. 
Part I of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) in section 111, by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(c) 
EXTRATERRITORIAL
JURISDICTION.— 
There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
the conduct prohibited by this section.’’; 
(2) in section 115, by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(e) There is extraterritorial jurisdiction 
over the conduct prohibited by this sec-
tion.’’; and 
(3) in section 1114— 
(A) by inserting ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—’’ before 
‘‘Whoever’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(b) 
EXTRATERRITORIAL
JURISDICTION.— 
There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
the conduct prohibited by this section.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
921, the Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila 
Federal Officers and Employees Protec-
tion Act. This Senate-passed bill would 
correct a manifest wrong by making 
clear that the law prohibiting the kill-
ing of Federal employees extends be-
yond American borders. 
Our Justice Department must have 
the ability to ensure that anyone who 
kills or attempts to kill individuals 
serving our country outside the United 
States are brought to justice under 
current law. 
The tragic circumstance that makes 
this bill necessary bears repeating. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement 
Special Agents Jaime Zapata and Vic-
tor Avila were assigned abroad to pro-
tect American interests. In early 2011, 
while traveling in a convoy near San 
Luis Potosi, Mexico, the American 
agents were attacked by agents of the 
Los Zetas drug cartel. 
In the firefight, both Agents Zapata 
and Avila were shot. Tragically, Agent 
Zapata died from his wounds. A thor-
ough investigation brought the per-
petrators of this heinous act to the 
United States to stand to account for 
the acts, and they were convicted. Yet, 
justice remained unfulfilled. 
In January 2020, the D.C. Circuit 
Court of Appeals vacated the murder 
conviction of two Los Zetas cartel 
members responsible for the murder of 
Agent Zapata and attempted murder of 
Agent Avila. 
In doing so, the Court of Appeals 
found that the law we are amending 
today did not contain an adequate ex-
pression that it was intended to apply 
to 
crimes 
committed 
outside 
the 
United States. 
Today, we correct this errant and ap-
parently unfair judicial interpretation. 
This bill does not extend criminal laws 
or penalties, nor does it create a new 
crime, it merely clarifies Congress’ 
original intent. 
Because of this bill, the United 
States Government may prosecute any-
one who killed or attempted to kill a 
Federal officer or employee, whether 
they be agents or diplomats, while they 
were performing their official duties 
outside of the United States. The rule 
of law will prevail. 
Interestingly 
enough, 
since 
the 
killings in that tragic incident, we 
have seen a number of attacks against 
many of our outstanding Federal em-
ployees, diplomats, and others over-
seas. That is all this bill would do, but 
it is an important thing to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Tex-
ans, Mr. CUELLAR and Mr. MCCAUL, for 
leading the House companion to this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation out of basic and 
endearing justice for all, and for the 
families of these men. 
I rise in support of S. 921, the ‘‘Jaime Za-
pata and Victor Avila Federal Officers and Em-
ployees Protection Act.’’ This Senate-passed 
bill would correct a manifest wrong by making 
clear that the law prohibiting the killing of fed-
eral employees extends beyond American bor-
ders. 
Our Justice Department must have the abil-
ity to ensure that anyone who kills or attempts 
to kill individuals serving our country outside 
the United States are brought to justice under 
current law. 
The tragic circumstances that make this bill 
necessary bear repeating. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement Special Agents Jaime 
Zapata and Victor Avila were assigned abroad 
to protect American interests. In early 2011, 
while traveling in a convoy near San Luis 
Potosi, Mexico, the American agents were at-
tacked by members of the Los Zetas drug car-
tel. 
In the firefight, both Agents Zapata and 
Agent Avila were shot. Tragically Agent Za-
pata died from his wounds. 
A thorough investigation brought the per-
petrators of this heinous attack to the United 
States to stand to account for the acts, and 
they were convicted. 
Yet, justice remained unfulfilled. In January 
2020, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals va-
cated the murder convictions of two Los Zetas 
cartel members responsible for the murder of 
Agent Zapata and attempted murder of Agent 
Avila. 
In doing so, the Court of Appeals found that 
the law we are amending today did not con-
tain an adequate expression that it was in-
tended to apply to crimes committed outside 
the United States. 
Today, we correct this errant judicial inter-
pretation. 
This bill does not extend criminal laws or 
penalties. Nor does it create a new crime. It 
merely clarifies Congress’s original intent. 
Because of this bill, the United States gov-
ernment may prosecute anyone who killed or 
attempted to kill a federal officer or employee, 
whether they be agents or diplomats, while 
they were performing their official duties out-
side of the United States. The rule of law will 
prevail. 
That is all this bill would do but it is an im-
portant thing to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5943 
October 27, 2021 
I thank my fellow Texas Representatives 
HENRY CUELLAR and MICHAEL MCCAUL for 
leading the House companion to this bill. And 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
921, the Jamie Zapata and Victor Avila 
Federal Officers and Employees Protec-
tion Act. 
In 2011, members of the Los Zetas 
drug cartel gunned down ICE Agents 
Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila in an 
attempted carjacking. Agent Zapata 
was killed. 
The perpetrators of this terrible 
crime were members of the Los Zetas 
hit squad on a mission that day to 
shoot and steal vehicles for cartel oper-
ations. 
The 
murder 
and 
attempted 
carjacking occurred in Mexico. So the 
perpetrators were extradited to the 
United States to face trial for the mur-
der and attempted murder of the Amer-
ican agents. 
In 2017, the cartel members were con-
victed under section 1114 of title 18 of 
the United States Code, which pro-
hibits the killing of an officer of the 
United States. They were sentenced to 
life in prison. 
On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled that because the crimes 
occurred on foreign soil, section 1114 
did not apply. 
In light of this ruling, Federal law 
enforcement officers and civil servants 
stationed overseas are made more vul-
nerable to attack. The decision created 
a circuit split and opened a loophole in 
Federal law reversing centuries of 
precedent that the law was intended to 
apply extraterritorially. 
The bill simply codifies centuries of 
precedent and legal understanding by 
clarifying the extraterritorial applica-
tion of three Federal statutes to pro-
tect our Federal law enforcement offi-
cers and other Federal officials. The 
bill passed the Senate by unanimous 
consent in May. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR), 
the original sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Representative JACKSON Lee 
for her leadership in this effort to 
make sure that we protect not only 
other diplomats, but our agents that 
work overseas. I also want to thank 
Mr. MICHAEL MCCAUL, one of my co- 
leads on this, Mr. BILL PASCRELL, Mr. 
FILEMON VELA, and other Members, all 
bipartisan, that support this. 
On the Senate side, the lead sponsors 
were Senator JOHN CORNYN and also 
Senator CHRIS
COONS, and a whole 
bunch of other folks. I certainly want 
to say thank you so much. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is im-
portant because this is a bipartisan 
bill, and it ensures that individuals 
who harm or attempt to harm U.S. 
Federal officers or employees serving 
abroad can be brought to justice and 
prosecuted in the United States. 
Furthermore, this bill will improve 
the safety and the security of not only 
the agents but any diplomat or any 
Federal employee that works outside 
the U.S. or overseas by ensuring that 
crimes that are committed against 
Americans serving abroad can be pros-
ecuted by United States courts. 
b 1300 
As the chairwoman mentioned a few 
minutes ago, it was very unfortunate 
what happened, and it is a change on 
the—we want to make sure that the in-
tent of the law that has been there will 
be followed, and that basically just 
means that that section 1114 of the 
United States Code would say that it 
also covers foreign jurisdiction. So, 
therefore, we ask that we support this 
legislation because as it was men-
tioned, on February 15, 2011, ICE Spe-
cial Agent Jaime Zapata and also his 
colleague, Victor Avila, were ambushed 
by members of the Mexican drug car-
tels in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. 
Unfortunately, as it has been men-
tioned, Special Agent Zapata died be-
cause of his injuries. ICE Special Agent 
Jaime Zapata’s murderer cannot be 
brought to justice because of that loop-
hole in the current law, and this bipar-
tisan legislation will close that loop-
hole and ensure that the safety of all 
Federal employees serving our Nation 
abroad will be protected. 
There must be severe consequences 
brought to bear against any individual 
who harms any of the Federal employ-
ees who are serving abroad. We need to 
know that the heroism of Special 
Agent Zapata and also Special Agent 
Avila, by holding those people who 
committed violence, are held account-
able. 
Furthermore, this issue and this bill 
is also important to me because Spe-
cial Agent Zapata was assigned to the 
Homeland Security Investigations Of-
fice located in my hometown, Laredo, 
Texas, while he served on the Human 
Smuggling and Trafficking Unit as 
well as the Border Enforcement Secu-
rity Task Force known as BEST. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is about accountability. It is about 
leaving no American behind. The safe-
ty of our Nation depends on our heroes 
who are willing to raise their hands 
and put their own lives on the line re-
gardless of if they are at home or 
abroad. 
Tragically, a current loophole in Fed-
eral law has allowed the killers of 
Jaime Zapata, a Texan and American 
hero, to escape the murder convictions 
and sentences that they were found 
guilty for, and justice must be served. 
In 2011, as you heard the details al-
ready, Mr. Speaker, let’s reiterate the 
two ICE agents, Jaime Zapata as well 
as Victor Avila, were deployed to Mex-
ico to curb human and drug trafficking 
at our southern border. The two were 
ambushed and gunned down by mem-
bers of a Mexican drug cartel who 
opened fire on them along Highway 57. 
Both agents were struck, and Jaime 
Zapata tragically died from his inju-
ries. 
Weeks after the ambush, seven of 
these killers were extradited to the 
United States, and two were found 
guilty of murder. But last year, a Fed-
eral appeals court dismissed the mur-
der convictions on the basis that the 
district court did not have jurisdiction 
over the crimes that were committed 
against those law enforcement agents 
who were stationed outside of our bor-
ders. 
This is unacceptable, as has been 
mentioned. Anyone who attacks a U.S. 
Federal agent who is protecting our 
country, whether at home or abroad, 
must be held accountable and must be 
brought to justice. 
I am proud to support this legislation 
to work with my colleagues across the 
aisle, and I am proud of the bipartisan-
ship 
that 
Ms. 
JACKSON
LEE, 
Mr. 
CUELLAR, and so many others have 
brought forward today. It is very im-
portant. Again, this goes to the heart 
of accountability, and it goes to the 
heart of leaving no American behind. 
I appreciate also the leadership of 
Senators 
JOHN
CORNYN
and 
CHRIS 
COONS on this very important initia-
tive. Our country’s heroes deserve to 
know that those of us in Congress in a 
bipartisan way will hold those to ac-
count who break the law. It is so im-
portant for us to stand by law enforce-
ment, especially those who are willing 
to give their all outside of our borders. 
Mr. BENTZ. In closing, Mr. Speaker, 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is nec-
essary to ensure that Federal employ-
ees who are serving overseas can be 
protected by the American umbrella of 
justice. 
We have seen since this tragic inci-
dent of those who were serving our 
country and lost their life and were in-
jured. We have seen a myriad of at-
tacks on diplomats and others outside 
of the boundaries of war. We have been 
stunned by actions against diplomats 
in embassies and outside of embassies. 
So this is a bipartisan bill that was 
adopted by the Senate by unanimous 
consent, and I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this legislation 
so the President can sign it into law 
and to be able to tell all of our Federal 
employees 
and 
diplomats 
who 
are 
standing in the name of that flag that 
is shown behind you, Mr. Speaker, that 
we do care about their service and 
their safety.

Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting S. 1502, the COPS 
Counseling Act, a bill that will encour-
age the adoption of law enforcement 
peer counseling programs across the 
country and protect the privacy of Fed-
eral officers as they seek mental 
health support. 
It is important to all of us that we 
promote the mental health and well- 
being of our law enforcement officers, 
not only in order to help individual of-
ficers but also because it helps bolster 
the safety of our communities and the 
people our officers take a solemn oath 
to protect. 
Law enforcement officers play a spe-
cial role in our communities. They are 
specifically called upon to protect and 
serve. Often they see, encounter, and 
respond to horrendous situations that 
are both dangerous and stressful and 
often life-threatening. 
I don’t know how many times, Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard on the news 
where officers have said: I have never 
seen this in my lifetime. I have never 
seen this horrific scene. I have never 
seen a car crash. I have never seen the 
violence. 
With the pandemic of COVID–19, we 
have seen officers coming to scenes 
that they expressed that they have 
never seen. That has an impact even 
though they must continue to rise the 
next day and serve. 
They are indeed first responders, on 
the scene when unthinkable and tragic 
events take place, whether they be 
mass shootings, terrible incidents of 
domestic or sexual violence, and other 
horrific 
instances 
of 
victimization. 
Even after the incidents are over and 
the threats addressed, these situations 
can long remain with officers. As they 
seek to protect us, we must also seek 
to protect them when they are in need. 
We have a hearing today on issues 
dealing with gun safety. That is not 
this bill. But what I will say is that the 
officers in times of crisis are always 
the first ones to come to school shoot-
ings, violent scenes where they see 
children who are wounded or tragically 
are dead. Imagine an officer having to 
pick him or herself up and carry on 
after you have seen, yes, little chil-
dren—high school, middle school, ele-
mentary school—who have been fallen 
because of school shootings. That is a 
particularly unique circumstance. But 
there are many, many others. 
That is why I support this bill which 
would help officers who seek coun-
seling. The bill provides confidentiality 
to Federal law enforcement officers by 
restricting individuals who participate 
in a peer support counseling session 
from disclosing communications aris-
ing out of peer support counseling ses-
sion. 
In doing so, however, the bill defines 
clear and necessary exceptions to con-
fidentiality in circumstances including 
explicit threats of suicide; any admis-
sion of criminal conduct; any explicit 
threat of imminent and serious phys-
ical harm or death to an individual; 
any information relating to the abuse 
or neglect of a child, older person, or 
vulnerable person; or any information 
that is required by law to be reported. 
That had to be clarified. 
Additionally, this bill encourages im-
plementation of peer counseling pro-
grams within the entire first responder 
community by requiring the Depart-
ment of Justice to make best practices 
publicly available on its website. Infor-
mation I have found has been the key 
in helping to restore the stability of 
these individuals who are needing the 
kind of counseling that we offer. 
The Department of Justice is also re-
quired to provide a list of training pro-
grams for public safety officers to be-
come peer support mentors. Always we 
have been told that to have a like fel-
low traveler, a like experienced person, 
a like person in your career or profes-
sion, Mr. Speaker, is sometimes the 
best medicine, the best cure, and the 
best direction toward treatment. 
These are important steps that will 
help our officers and the communities 
they serve. 
As we take action on this Senate- 
passed bill, I want to recognize our col-
league from Maryland, Representative 
DAVID TRONE, for his work in intro-
ducing the House companion legisla-
tion. I thank the chairman of our com-
mittee, Mr. NADLER, for being focused 
on this legislation, and I am delighted 
that my subcommittee is also very in-
terested in this kind of work. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
bill, I am proud to support it, and I ask 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Today, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
supporting S. 1502, the ‘‘COPS Counseling 
Act,’’ a bill that will encourage the adoption of 
law enforcement peer counseling programs 
across the country and protect the privacy of 
federal officers as they seek mental health 
support. 
It is important to all of us that we promote 
the mental health and well—being of our law 
enforcement officers, not only in order to help 
individual officers but also because it helps 
bolster the safety of our communities and the 
people our officers take a solemn oath to pro-
tect. 
Law enforcement officers play a special role 
in our communities, specifically called upon to 
protect and serve. 
Often, they see, encounter, and respond to 
horrendous situations that are both dangerous 
and stressful, and often life-threatening. 
They are indeed first responders, on the 
scene when unthinkable and tragic events 
take place, whether they be mass shootings, 
terrible incidents of domestic or sexual vio-
lence, and other horrific instances of victimiza-
tion. 
Even after the incidents are over and the 
threats addressed, these situations can long 
remain with officers. As they seek to protect 
us, we must also seek to help them when they 
are in need. 
That is why I support this bill, which would 
help officers who seek counseling. 
The bill provides confidentiality to federal 
law enforcement officers by restricting individ-
uals who participate in a peer support coun-
seling session from disclosing communications 
arising out of a peer support counseling ses-
sion. 
In doing so, however, the bill defines clear 
and necessary exceptions to confidentiality in 
circumstances including: explicit threats of sui-
cide; any admission of criminal conduct; any 
explicit threat of imminent and serious physical 
harm or death to an individual; any information 
relating to the abuse or neglect of a child, 
older person or vulnerable person; or any in-
formation that is required by law to be re-
ported. 
Additionally, this bill encourages implemen-
tation of peer counseling programs within the 
entire first responder community by requiring 
the Department of Justice to make best prac-
tices publicly available on its website. 
The Department of Justice is also required 
to provide a list of training programs for public 
safety officers to become peer support men-
tors. 
These are important steps that will help our 
officers and the communities they serve. 
As we take action on this Senate-passed 
bill, I want to recognize our colleague from 
Maryland, Representative DAVID TRONE, for his 
work in introducing the House companion leg-
islation. 
This is an important bill. I am proud to sup-
port it and ask that my colleagues do the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1502, the COPS Counseling Act of 2021. 
With recent attacks on law enforce-
ment agencies from the left, including 
calls to defund the police, officers 
around the country have suffered from 
persistent and increasing physical and 
mental stress. 
Police departments are experiencing 
dropping retention rates and officers 
are left with fewer colleagues to sup-
port them while also facing more 
crime. As a result the need for new and 
better performing peer support groups 
with State and local law enforcement 
agencies has risen. 
This bill would help alleviate some of 
that strain from dealing with the ever- 
increasing amount of violent crime 
over the last year by supporting and 
encouraging the use of peer support 
groups. Some people feel like there is a 
stigma related to addressing mental 
health needs, making mental wellness 
difficult to address. 
Peer support programs can help ad-
dress this challenge in the law enforce-
ment community. Officers who are in

need of help may be most comfortable 
reaching out to their fellow officers es-
pecially if their confidentiality is pro-
tected. This bill requires the Depart-
ment of Justice, in consultation with 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services, to develop a report of best 
practices for peer support programs. 
These best practices required under the 
COPS Counseling Act will help State 
and local law enforcement agencies es-
tablish new peer counseling programs 
and enhance existing ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1315 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I want to again emphasize the mas-
sive number of law enforcement offi-
cers across the Nation. There are, first 
of all, 18,000 police departments of 
varying levels, meaning that we think 
of police, constables, or sheriffs, all of 
them law enforcement officers. And 
every day, as we speak, they are out on 
the front lines and, again, seeing enor-
mous tragedy. 
I really want to emphasize what it 
means to come upon a scene dealing 
with an injury to a child. Gun violence, 
car crashes, fires, police go to those 
scenes as well. For too long, we have 
not stopped for a moment to provide 
these resources and to provide these 
services. 
I hope that, as we pass this legisla-
tion, this will be the catalyst for local 
entities to build on their mental health 
relief and that they will also focus on 
peer-directed mental health relief. 
We can imagine, in the course of all 
the scenes that we have seen in this 
body, on this floor, in this year, start-
ing with January 6, where police offi-
cers were involved, that there is no 
doubt that this legislation is crucial. 
But it works across the Nation, and it 
should be a tool for ensuring the 
strength and the stability of our offi-
cers who are out there, men and 
women, family members, every single 
day. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank the gentlewoman from Texas 
for bringing this bill forward. It is very 
much needed. 
I rise, Mr. Speaker, to support the 
COPS Counseling Act, which is now 
one step away from reaching the Presi-
dent’s desk, I hope. 
I spent almost 40 years in law en-
forcement, including 12 as the sheriff of 
Duval County, Florida. So I can tell 
you, I have seen, firsthand, the chal-
lenges that some officers face in deal-
ing with not just acute stress for many 
years but the chronic stress over every 
day that they go to work. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that law 
enforcement is a dangerous profession. 
But these officers face potential life- 
threatening situations every day they 
go to work, and that is the chronic 
stress that really has a significant 
mental health impact upon these offi-
cers. Every day, they put their lives in 
that breach in defense of our commu-
nities. 
In recent years, we have seen a rise 
in ambush killings of officers and just 
overall assaults on officers, attacking 
them simply for the uniform that they 
wear. In fact, by just the middle of this 
year, we experienced as many shoot-
ings and killings of police officers as 
we did for the entire year of 2020. 
We also witness now the demoraliza-
tion, the delegitimization, and the 
defunding of police currently taking 
place around the U.S. 
We have also watched law enforce-
ment work through a deadly pandemic, 
losing so many officers to COVID–19 
over these last 2 years. 
To make things more difficult, many 
officers struggle to ask for help, even 
when they need it. Some officers feel 
traditional forms of counseling cannot 
truly understand what they are going 
through. They also might be concerned 
that seeking counseling could nega-
tively impact on their careers. It could 
be seen as a weakness. 
That is why the COPS Counseling 
Act is so very important. 
Again, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas. This provides the oppor-
tunity for law enforcement officers to 
receive confidential and peer-led sup-
port services. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is going 
to save lives. It is going to save offi-
cers’ lives, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the COPS 
Counseling Act to get this bill signed 
into law. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am very glad that we are able to 
come together, recognizing that our 
law enforcement officers face dangers 
every day. When I look to the support 
for that community, I really look to 
the family of citizens, the family of the 
community, no matter where you are, 
and I think that should be the state-
ment and the litmus test. 
When you speak to community per-
sons who generally go about their daily 
business, and local governments, you 
can be assured that there is an embodi-
ment of support. 
There is the sense of horror when we 
see circumstances that tragically hit 
this very Congress, this very House, on 
January 6, when that was not how 
brave law enforcement officers were 
treated. But we are well aware of the 
everyday work that is done. 
Before I left to come to Washington, 
I had the tragic duty of going to the fu-
neral of a fallen. What an amazing indi-
vidual that Deputy Atkins was, and the 
outpouring of love and affection by the 
community reflected that. 
To show the humanity of officers— 
they have moms and dads and wives 
and children—they read a letter from 
his mother. I just simply want to put 
this letter in from his mother. 
‘‘When I last saw you, before you said 
good-bye, I said the prayer I taught 
you, ‘As I lay me down to sleep.’ Nadia 
heard me and told me you always said 
that prayer.’’ Nadia was his wife. 
‘‘And that made me really feel good, 
Kareem. I love you so much and I will 
never stop loving you,’’ the letter said. 
A mother, a father, a fallen son. 
These are the true human aspects of 
service. 
So this help to officers who have 
seen, or been engaged, or seen fellow 
officers lose their lives, or been wound-
ed, or, again, come upon that scene 
that they will be interviewed, saying 
that they have never seen it before, 
never seen something so devastating 
like it before, this is an important step 
forward, as was the real justice bill for 
veterans, some of whom turn out to be 
police officers. 
I think we are moving so much in the 
right direction to be effectively con-
cerned about the whole person, and 
that is what this legislation, I believe, 
will move forward on. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article from the Houston Chronicle. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 25, 2021] 
DEPUTIES LINE UP BY THE DOZEN TO HONOR 
SLAIN PCT. 4 DEPUTY KAREEM ATKINS 
Hundreds gathered at a north Houston 
church Monday afternoon to pay their re-
spects to Kareem Atkins, the Precinct 4 dep-
uty constable who was fatally shot while try-
ing to stop a robbery. 
The day began with a private service for 
Atkins’ family. Officers lined up hours before 
the memorial service at Champion Forest 
Baptist Church to take a last look at their 
friend, removing their hats and saying a few 
words over the flag-draped casket at the 
front of the massive church hall. 
A slideshow played on screens next to the 
altar, with images of Atkins cuddling with 
his wife, Nadia Aweineh, and their young 
children, Adalynn, a toddler, and Aiden, a 
newborn. In other photos, Atkins was pic-
tured in uniform with fellow deputies and 
posing for group shots while out on the town 
with friends, a broad smile on his face. 
While some attendees silently wiped away 
tears after viewing Atkins’ casket, others 
laughed and shared stories, remembering At-
kins as the ‘‘loving, protective, funny, great 
dancing (or at least so he thought), outgoing 
and flashy guy’’ described in the funeral’s 
program. 
‘‘It seemed to me Kareem had many, many, 
best friends, and, on a daily basis, I saw his 
co-workers routinely look to him for guid-
ance,’’ Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman 
said at the memorial. ‘‘Despite his young 
age, he was someone you could count on to 
be calm, cool and collected. He had a unique 
strength about him. He was the rock we all 
leaned on.’’ 
‘‘If I had 100 more Kareem Atkinses (in my 
department), this boss would sleep much bet-
ter at night,’’ Herman said. 
Atkins’ godsister and former babysitter 
also spoke, sharing a letter Atkins’ mother, 
Celine Pemberton-Atkins, wrote to her son 
after his death. In the letter, Pemberton-At-
kins reminisced about the times her son 
would surprise her with visits home to New 
York City, where he was born, and about the 
inside jokes they shared that would not 
make sense to anyone else.

His mother noted in her letter that she’d 
just learned he was planning to travel home 
and surprise her for Thanksgiving. 
‘‘When I last saw you, before you said 
goodbye, I said the prayer I taught you, ‘As 
I lay me down to sleep.’ Nadia heard me and 
told me you always said that prayer . . . and 
that made me feel really good, Kareem. I 
love you so much and I will never stop loving 
you,’’ the letter said. 
END OF WATCH 
After the service, attendees filed out of the 
church for a color guard ceremony. The rows 
of friends, family and officers sat in silence 
amid a few isolated sobs as pallbearers 
wheeled Atkins’ casket to the family. The 
color guard folded the American flag that 
was covering the casket and handed it to the 
constable, who gave it to Atkins’ wife. 
Police dispatchers declared the ‘‘end of 
watch’’ over the air. A three-volley salute 
followed. Then Atkins’ coffin was placed in a 
hearse to be taken to Klein Memorial Park 
Cemetery in Tomball. 
The funeral came more than a week after 
Atkins was shot and killed—and two other 
Precinct 4 deputies were wounded—while at-
tempting to arrest a robbery suspect at 45 
Norte Sports Bar, where they worked side 
jobs as security guards. 
The shooter, who opened fire with a semi- 
automatic rifle, wounded Deputies Darryl 
Garrett and Juqaim Barthen, according to 
police. Garrett remained in the intensive 
care unit Monday, while Barthen, who at-
tended the service, is still recovering. 
On HoustonChronicle.com: ‘They were the 
3 amigos,’ fiancee of wounded Precinct 4 dep-
uty says after ambush in north Houston. 
Police have not identified or apprehended 
any suspects in the shooting. A reward for 
information leading to the assailant’s arrest 
and conviction was increased Wednesday to 
$75,000. 
MAKING TIME FLY ON THE SHIFT 
In comments during the funeral, Harris 
County Judge Lina Hidalgo declared Oct. 25 
‘‘Deputy Kareem Atkins Day’’ in Harris 
County from this year forward. 
‘‘When 
somebody 
ambushed 
Deputy 
Barthen, Deputy Garrett and Deputy Atkins, 
that attack on our protectors, that attack 
on you all, was an attack on our entire com-
munity,’’ Hidalgo said. 
‘‘They tried to tear down what makes our 
community great, to tear down that spirit of 
service, to break that trust that binds us, to 
bring fear, but we won’t tolerate that. The 
way we fight back against that, and honor 
Deputy Atkins’ life, is by living by the val-
ues he embodied,’’ Hidalgo said. 
Others attending the funeral remarked 
about Atkins’ good humor and generous spir-
it. 
Indrani Boodram and her co-workers came 
to support Atkins’ father, who worked with 
them at a medical center in north Cypress. 
She remembered how the younger Atkins 
helped her move about five years ago, despite 
never having met Boodram. ‘‘He had just 
moved here from New York and he knew no 
one. He even bought pizza when he came and 
told me he would stay with me until I was 
completely done.’’ 
Canray Warren, who worked other security 
jobs with Atkins at bars and clubs around 
the area, remembered the 30-year-old as 
someone who made the time fly on nights 
when the staff were tired and wanted to 
check out for the night. When it was nearing 
time to start closing shop, the pair would 
simply exchange looks and start cracking 
up. 
‘‘He kept us laughing and kept a smile on 
our face,’’ he said. ‘‘We’d joke about telling 
the DJ to play boring songs so everybody 
could move out of the club faster,’’ Warren 
said. 
Warren explained he wouldn’t want to take 
a shift if he learned that Atkins wasn’t 
working with him. And now, looking for-
ward, work won’t be the same without him.

seling Act. It is a piece of bipartisan 
legislation that I introduced with my 
good friend, DAVID TRONE from Mary-
land. Congressman TRONE has been an 
incredible partner. I am really grateful 
for all of his hard work, and as every-
body in this body knows, no one works 
harder than DAVID TRONE when he is 
pushing a bill. It is quite amazing to 
see and watch. 
Mr. Speaker, every day, our Nation’s 
law enforcement officers put their own 
lives at risk to keep us safe. That serv-
ice does not come without sacrifice. 
Last year, 178 current or Active-Duty 
law enforcement officers died by sui-
cide. Just this year, 121 officers have 
already taken their own lives. 
S. 
1502 
seeks 
to 
alleviate 
the 
stressors law enforcement experiences 
by establishing clear confidentiality 
standards for peer-to-peer counseling. 
A Fraternal Order of Police survey 
showed that 73 percent of surveyed offi-
cers found peer-to-peer support coun-
seling to be the most helpful mental 
health resource offered by police de-
partments. Unfortunately, an officer’s 
peer support communications can be 
discoverable on public record; it can be 
used in court proceedings; and worse, it 
can even impact and affect their em-
ployment. 
By creating clear standards for con-
fidentiality, the COPS Counseling Act 
would provide officers with peace of 
mind that their privacy is protected 
when they seek peer support services. 
This 
legislation 
also 
encourages 
State and local first responder agencies 
to adopt peer counseling programs so 
more officers can take advantage of 
this important mental health resource. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support our Nation’s law enforcement 
officers by voting for this legislation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
As I indicated in my discussions, I 
think the idea of the COPS Counseling 
Act is a profound statement that we 
see the whole person in law enforce-
ment. We don’t just see the person’s 
uniform externally, but we see the 
whole person. 
The reading of the words of Deputy 
Atkins’ mother was to indicate we see 
the family members, the children; we 
see the neighbors; we see the commu-
nities. In order to do that, we must 
then have a holistic approach to the 
service of these officers. 
I can’t help but think about officers 
coming upon an injury to a child in 
whatever form it is, and I have heard 
them speak of it. It is the worst inves-
tigation case to have. It is the worst 
scene that they have ever seen because 
it is a child. 
The COPS Counseling Act will help 
our law enforcement officers and also 
the communities they serve. We can 
and must do both. When officers are in 
need of counseling, we should remove 
barriers and disincentives that are 
standing in the way. 
Therefore, I ask my colleagues to see 
the whole person as they serve the 
community and the Nation, and join 
me in supporting this legislation so 
that the President can sign it into law. 
Mr. Speaker, the COPS Counseling Act will 
help our law enforcement officers and also the 
communities they serve. 
We can and must do both. 
When officers are in need of counseling, we 
should remove barriers and disincentives 
standing in the way. 
Therefore, I ask that my colleagues join me 
in supporting this legislation so that the Presi-
dent can sign it into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the COPS Counseling Act and thank my 
friend from Maryland, Mr. TRONE for leading 
this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, Every day police officers pro-
tect our communities with the uncommon 
character that’s common in police depart-
ments. The men and women in blue proudly 
protect and serve, braving challenging cir-
cumstances and running toward danger to 
keep us safe. Both they and their families feel 
this stress. I know this firsthand as my father 
is a retire NYPD Detective. 
As well, in the course of duty, police officers 
face dangerous and sometimes traumatic situ-
ations. Oftentimes, only a police officer can 
truly understand the stress their fellow officers 
are dealing with. 
Peer counseling has proven to be an effec-
tive method for officers to cope with this 
stress, in fact 73 percent of officers say it’s the 
most helpful mental health resource available 
to them. The COPS Counseling Act ensures 
more officers can access this important re-
source and protects officers’ privacy, elimi-
nating the stigma of seeking help. Police offi-
cers do a dangerous and necessary job to 
protect our communities. The COPS Coun-
seling Act helps police officers help keep each 
other safe so they can keep us all safe. I urge 
a yes vote. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of S. 1502, the COPS 
Counseling Act of 2021. I was also proud to 
cosponsor the House companion to this bill— 
H.R. 3070—introduced by Representatives 
DAVID
TRONE
of 
Maryland 
and 
GUY 
RESCHENTHALER of Pennsylvania. 
This bipartisan and bicameral legislation 
would encourage the adoption of law enforce-
ment peer counseling programs across the na-
tion by requiring the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice to issue and make publicly available a re-
port on best practices for such programs. To

further support their implementation, the bill 
would also direct the Department to provide a 
list of training programs for individuals to be-
come peer support mentors. 
Our law enforcement officers often face 
challenging and at times traumatic experi-
ences while performing their duties and keep-
ing our communities safe. It’s critical we en-
sure they have the necessary level of support 
to address these situations, and peer-to-peer 
counseling can serve as an effective mental 
health outlet to share their personal experi-
ences; access and identify resources; and re-
ceive help and guidance within a trusted net-
work of colleagues. 
To ensure peer counseling programs are ef-
fective, it’s also important we protect the pri-
vacy of those officers seeking mental health 
services. That’s why I’m pleased the COPS 
Counseling Act would require that the informa-
tion disclosed during peer support counseling 
sessions by Federal law enforcement officers 
is kept confidential, except under certain cir-
cumstances such as threats of physical harm 
and admission of criminal activity. This guar-
antee of privacy will go a long way in building 
confidence and encouraging more Federal law 
enforcement officers to take advantage of the 
opportunities provided through these pro-
grams. 
Every day, our brave men and women in 
law enforcement put their lives on the line to 
protect our communities. As Members of Con-
gress, we must redouble our efforts to support 
them, including through mental health and 
counseling services. That’s why I support the 
COPS Counseling Act and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.

SEC. 9. SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S FIRST RE-

Section 3 of Safeguarding America’s First 
Responders Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-157) is 
amended— 
(1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ‘‘be-
tween January 1, 2020, and December 31, 
2021’’ and inserting ‘‘during the period begin-

(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(c) TERMINATION DATE.—For purposes of

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), expires; and 
‘‘(2) December 31, 2023.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1511, the 
Protecting America’s First Responders 
Act of 2021, which will make important 
improvements to the Department of 
Justice Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program. 
Every day, public safety officers put 
their lives on the line for the greater 
good of those whom they have taken an 
oath to serve and protect. Unfortu-
nately, some of those brave men and 
women make the ultimate sacrifice 
and die while in the line of duty. 
The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program, which is administered by the 
Justice Department’s Bureau of Jus-
tice Assistance, was established in 1976 
to provide certain benefits to families 
of these officers, as well as to officers 
who are disabled as a result of their 
service. 
A death benefit is provided to eligible 
survivors 
of 
public 
safety 
officers 
whose deaths are sustained in or due to 
actions in the line of duty. 
b 1330 
An education benefit is provided to 
spouses and children of public safety 
officers killed or disabled while on 
duty, and the program provides dis-
ability benefits to officers catastroph-
ically injured in the line of duty. 
This program provides critical sup-
port to these officers and their fami-
lies, and it is important that Congress 
continually 
oversee 
implementation 
and periodically update it to make it 
more effective and more efficient. That 
is what this bill would do. 
Specifically, the bill would expand 
the program’s restrictive definition of 
disability so that permanently disabled 
first responders are able to perform 
work for therapeutic purposes, work 
that involves simple tasks, or work 
that provides special accommodations 
and still receive PSOB benefits. 
The bill would provide for retroactive 
disability benefits to public safety offi-
cers who responded to the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks, allowing 
those first responders who became per-
manently disabled as a result of their 
work at Ground Zero to reapply for dis-
ability benefits under the bill’s ex-
panded disability definition. 
I am not from New York. I represent 
Texas. But I was at the edge of the cre-
ation of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, which was generated around 
the tragic terrorist acts of 9/11, and 
interacted with those individuals who, 
time after time, went onto the smol-
dering grounds of Ground Zero to re-
cover the remains of all who had fallen 
on that day. 
They never stopped, Mr. Speaker, 
month after month, day after day. We 
honored those persons in the 20th com-
memoration of 9/11. I will speak about 
that as we continue this debate. There 
was no more moving, powerful, tragic, 
or devastating a moment in America’s 
life, among others. 
This 
bill 
would 
address 
lengthy 
delays in processing benefit claims by 
permitting the DOJ to use subpoena 
power to expedite claims so that im-
pacted officers and families aren’t left 
waiting for their owed relief during the 
most difficult of times. 
For cases pending longer than 365 
days, the bill would index the award 
amount to the date of the final deter-
mination, rather than the date of death 
or injury, so that families aren’t finan-
cially penalized for any delays. 
The bill would extend benefits to cer-
tain public safety officers not cur-
rently covered, including Good Samari-
tan officers who act outside of their ju-
risdiction in an emergency situation, 
trainee officers, and fire police who 
handle traffic and crime scene manage-
ment. 
The bill would close a loophole in the 
program where children born after the 
death or disability of a public safety of-
ficer are not able to receive education 
benefits and mandate that the DOJ 
provide backpay of educational bene-
fits to children previously left out. 
Finally, this bill also includes an ex-
tension 
of 
Safeguarding 
America’s 
First Responders Act concerning the 
provision of benefits for officers who 
contract COVID–19 in the line of duty. 
I thank the gentleman from New Jer-
sey, my dear friend, Representative 
BILL PASCRELL, for his leadership of 
the House companion to this bill and 
his longstanding service as champion 
of the Congressional Fire Services Cau-
cus, which I am delighted to have been 
a part of, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1511, the ‘‘Pro-
tecting America’s First Responders Act of 
2021,’’ which will make important improve-
ments to the Department of Justice’s Public 
Safety Officers’ Benefits program. 
Every day, public safety officers put their 
lives on the line for the greater good of those 
whom they have taken an oath to serve and 
protect. 
Unfortunately, some of these brave men 
and women make the ultimate sacrifice and 
die while in the line of duty. 
The Public Safety Officers’ Benefit Program, 
which is administered by the Justice Depart-
ment’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, was es-
tablished in 1976 to provide certain benefits to 
the families of these officers as well as to offi-
cers who are disabled as a result of their serv-
ice. 
A death benefit is provided to eligible sur-
vivors of public safety officers whose deaths 
are sustained in or due to actions in the line 
of duty. 
An education benefit is provided to spouses 
and children of public safety officers killed or 
disabled while on duty. 
And, the Program provides disability bene-
fits to officers catastrophically injured in the 
line-of-duty. 
This Program provides critical support to 
these officers and their families, and it is im-
portant that Congress continually oversee its 
implementation and periodically update it to 
make it more effective and more efficient. That 
is what this bill would do. 
Specifically, the bill would expand the Pro-
gram’s restrictive definition of disability so that 
permanently disabled first responders are able 
to perform work for therapeutic purposes, work 
that involves simple tasks, or work that pro-
vides special accommodations and still receive 
PSOB benefits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5951 
October 27, 2021 
The bill would provide for retroactive dis-
ability benefits to public safety officers who re-
sponded to the September 11, 2001 terrorist 
attacks, allowing those first responders who 
became permanently disabled as a result of 
their work at Ground Zero to re-apply for dis-
ability benefits under the bill’s expanded dis-
ability definition. 
The bill would address lengthy delays in 
processing benefit claims by permitting DOJ to 
use subpoena power to expedite claims, so 
that impacted officers and families aren’t left 
waiting for their owed relief during the most 
difficult of times. 
For cases pending longer than 365 days, 
the bill would index the award amount to the 
date of final determination, rather than the 
date of death or injury, so families aren’t finan-
cially penalized for any delays. 
The bill would extend benefits to certain 
public safety officers not currently covered, in-
cluding Good Samaritan officers who act out-
side of their jurisdiction in an emergency situa-
tion, trainee officers, and fire-police who han-
dle traffic and crime scene management. 
And the bill would close a loophole in the 
Program where children born after the death 
or disability of a public safety officer are not 
able to receive education benefits, and man-
date that DOJ provide back pay of educational 
benefits to children previously left out. 
Finally, this bill also includes an extension of 
the Safeguarding America’s First Responders 
Act concerning the provision of benefits for of-
ficers who contract COVID–19 in the line of 
duty. 
I thank the Gentleman from New Jersey, 
Representative BILL PASCRELL, for his leader-
ship of the House companion to this bill, and 
I urge all my colleagues to support this bill 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1511, the Protecting America’s First 
Responders Act of 2021. This bill is 
about taking care of our Federal, 
State, and local public safety officers 
who are working on the front lines 
every day to protect us. Our Nation’s 
law enforcement officers need our sup-
port now more than ever. 
Over the past year, we have seen vio-
lent crime rise in nearly every major 
urban area. During this spike in vio-
lence, we have seen city councils 
defund their police departments, tak-
ing vital resources away from the 
brave men and women who protect us 
day in and day out. On top of that, our 
law enforcement officers are dealing 
with all of the complications of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
According to the Fraternal Order of 
Police, over 700 public safety officers 
have tragically lost their lives due to 
COVID–19. That number will inevitably 
continue to rise. 
The Department of Justice’s Public 
Safety Officers’ Benefits Program pro-
vides assistance to officers and their 
families in the event that they lose 
their lives or are catastrophically in-
jured in the line of duty. The PSOB 
Program 
reviews 
over 
a 
thousand 
claims submitted every year. 
The program provides a one-time, 
lump-sum payment of $370,000 for offi-
cers who lose their lives or are cata-
strophically injured in the line of duty. 
The payment amount is adjusted annu-
ally based on the Consumer Price 
Index. 
Each 
claimant’s 
payment 
amount is determined by the date of 
the injury or death, but the claim may 
take years to adjudicate. 
This bill corrects this inequity by re-
quiring that payment amounts be de-
termined by the date of adjudication 
for any claim that has been pending for 
over a year. This will help these law 
enforcement officers and their families 
account for increased cost of living and 
other expenses that are subject to in-
flation during these lengthy adjudica-
tion periods. 
The PSOB Program also provides in-
terim payments for death claims if the 
claimant is likely to receive an award 
under the program, but the interim 
payment amount has not increased 
since 1976. This bill will increase those 
interim payments for death claims 
from $3,000 to $6,000 and require annual 
adjustments based on the Consumer 
Price Index to ensure that Congress 
will not need to make further adjust-
ments in the future. 
The PSOB Program also provides 
educational benefits of $1,200 a month 
to children of public safety officers 
who have been killed or disabled in the 
line of duty. Here, too, many of these 
claims for education benefits are not 
adjudicated in a timely fashion, and 
many children do not receive these 
benefits. This bill will provide backpay 
to the children of fallen and disabled 
public safety officers who qualify for 
benefits but failed to receive benefits 
due to a delay in processing these 
claims. 
Finally, this bill will update the 
PSOB Program’s definition of dis-
ability to ensure that law enforcement 
officers who are permanently unable to 
secure meaningful, gainful employ-
ment following a catastrophic injury in 
the line of duty remain eligible for ben-
efits. 
This is a critical and necessary piece 
of legislation, and I am proud to sup-
port a bill that takes care of the men 
and women of our law enforcement 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my privilege to yield again to the 
distinguished gentleman from New Jer-
sey, Mr. PASCRELL, who I have worked 
with, as have many others, as he has 
been on the front lines of helping first 
responders. He continues to do it, and I 
will continue to work with him. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL). 
Mr. 
PASCRELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
It is good to have something bipar-
tisan on this floor, I will tell you that. 
Mr. Speaker, during this devastating 
pandemic, our Nation’s first responders 
have stood heroically on the very front 
lines 
keeping 
communities 
across 
America safe. Our firefighters, police, 
and EMS go to work every day, and 
they risk their lives and the lives of 
their families. 
In my own district, we lost Paterson 
police officer Frank Scorpo and Pas-
saic firefighter Israel Tolentino to 
COVID. These men made the ultimate 
sacrifice for their communities. 
My heart bleeds for all of our fallen 
first responders and their families. 
Last year was the deadliest ever for 
our Nation’s public safety officers. 
COVID has made it clear as day that 
more must be done to support these he-
roes. 
As long-time co-chair of the Law En-
forcement Caucus and the Fire Serv-
ices Caucus, I have been proud to lead 
efforts to pass the bipartisan Pro-
tecting America’s First Responders Act 
with Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY. 
I want to thank Senator GRASSLEY 
for working together to get this bill 
across the finish line. He has been a 
good partner to shepherd this through 
the other Chamber. 
Currently, the Public Safety Officers’ 
Benefits Program only provides dis-
ability benefits to first responders who 
can never again perform any com-
pensated work at all. This is so restric-
tive that officers practically need to be 
in a vegetative state to qualify. 
Our bill will guarantee that first re-
sponders and their families get their 
owed benefits without delay or red 
tape. 
Our legislation will expand the dis-
ability definition so permanently in-
jured first responders can still receive 
benefits and perform work that is for 
therapeutic purposes, involves simple 
tasks, and provides special accom-
modations. 
Our legislation also provides retro-
active disability benefits to injured 9/11 
first responders. 
The bill extends these critical officer 
safety benefits to groups unfairly left 
out of the program. This includes 
trainees, fire police officers, and Good 
Samaritan first responders who protect 
the public while off duty. 
Importantly, our bill extends the 
statutory presumption that guarantees 
the families of first responders fallen 
to COVID–19 receive full public safety 
officer benefits. 
I was glad to work alongside Chair-
man NADLER to pass this presumption 
into law last year. I thank him for his 
efforts to bring the Protecting Amer-
ica’s First Responders Act to the floor 
today. It is especially important be-
cause our bill provides an extension of 
this critical provision. 
Finally, I want to recognize the fire 
and police organizations who support 
our bill. Thank you to the Fraternal 
Order of Police, the Federal Law En-
forcement Officers Association, the Na-
tional Association of Police Organiza-
tions, the International Association of 
Fire Chiefs, and the National Volun-
teer Fire Council. I especially want to

Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
statements from each of these organi-

STAKEHOLDER
SUPPORT
FOR
PROTECTING 
AMERICA’S FIRST RESPONDERS ACT (S. 1511 / 
H.R. 2936) 
Edward A. Kelly, General President of the 
International Association of Firefighters 
(IAFF): ‘‘On behalf of the 325,000 professional 
fire fighters and emergency medical per-
sonnel of the International Association of 
Fire Fighters, I respectfully request you vote 
in favor of S. 1511, the Protecting America’s 
First Responders Act (PAFRA). This bipar-
tisan legislation will help ensure the fami-
lies of fire fighters and emergency medical 
personnel who are disabled or die in the line 
of duty receive the compensation and bene-
fits they deserve. 
The Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB) 
provides guaranteed death and disability 
benefits to emergency responders who die or 
are disabled in the line of duty. Unfortu-
nately, current law places significant limits 
on program awards, leaving the families of 
deceased or injured public safety officers 
without deserved recompense. PAFRA cor-
rects these oversights by ensuring disabled 
responders may qualify for necessary bene-
fits, extending benefits to fire department 
cadets who are killed or injured in the course 
of their training, extending benefits to chil-
dren of public safety officers who had not 
been born at the time of the officer’s death 
or disability, and extending benefits for offi-
cers who die from COVID–19 for the duration 
of the public health emergency. 
Fire fighters and emergency medical re-
sponders make significant sacrifices to serve 
their communities everyday, and should not 
need to worry about their families’ financial 
security should they sustain lasting injuries 
or lose their life in the line of duty. PAFRA 
will help ensure responders’ families are 
cared for in the face of catastrophe, and de-
serves your affirmative vote.’’ 
Ken Stuebing, Acting President and Chair-
man of the Board of the International Asso-
ciation of Fire Chiefs (IAFC): ‘‘I would like 
to thank Representative Pascrell for intro-
ducing the Protecting America’s First Re-
sponders Act. This legislation would revise 
the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits program 
to provide necessary assistance to more fam-
ilies of fallen public safety officers during 
their time of need. The IAFC looks forward 
to working with Congress to pass this impor-
tant legislation.’’ 
Steven W. Hirsch, Chair of the National 
Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC): ‘‘PAFRA 
makes important improvements to the proc-
ess by which public safety officers are able to 
access the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
(PSOB) Disability Program. It also makes 
necessary changes to how PSOB claims are 
paid to the survivors of public safety officers 
who died of occupational illnesses related to 
work at Ground Zero after 9/11. Finally, I am 
very pleased that the PAFRA includes lan-
guage clarifying that members of volunteer 
fire departments who perform scene security 
and traffic management duties at emergency 
scenes are public safety officers’’ 
Patrick Yoes, National President of the 
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP): ‘‘The PSOB 
program is currently burdened with unrea-
sonable definitions of the terms ‘cata-
strophic injury’ and ‘gainful work’ that pre-
vent officers who are disabled in the line of 
duty from receiving the benefits to which 
they are entitled. This legislation addresses 
this issue by making the PSOB standards 
more consistent with similar Federal benefit 
for programs which will improve the ability 
of our injured and disabled officers to have 
their claims processed more fairly and more 
quickly’’ 
Larry Cosme, National President of the 
Federal Law Enforcement Officers Associa-
tion (FLEOA): ‘‘FLEOA fought for years to 
have the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
(PSOB) program created in order to support 
officers killed or injured in the line of duty. 
Congress meant for this important program 
to support officers and their families. Unfor-
tunately far too many officers are unable to 
qualify for any type of disability benefit due 
to how the law was written, including heroic 
9/11 responders who continue to face lin-
gering health issues metastasizing years 
later after the attack. FLEOA appreciates 
the bipartisan and bicameral leadership of 
Representative Pascrell and Senator Grass-
ley to ensure officers are able to access the 
PSOB program benefits they are entitled to 
and have earned, and look forward to work-
ing with their offices and other champions in 
Congress to advance this critical reform’’ 
Bill Johnson, Executive Director of the Na-
tional Association of Police Organizations 
(NAPO): ‘‘The goal of the Protecting Amer-
ica’s First Responders Act is to help protect 
the ability of survivors, disabled officers and 
their families to get the death and disability 
benefits they so rightly deserve. This impor-
tant legislation will ensure that officers who 
are disabled in the line of duty are not left 
behind by the Public Safety Officers’ Bene-
fits (PSOB) Program and that all children of 
our fallen or disabled heroes are able to ben-
efit from the Public Safety Officers’ Edu-
cation Assistance Program. NAPO supports 
the efforts of Representative Pascrell and 
Senator Grassley to ensure that America’s 
public safety officers, who put their lives on 
the line every day in service to our nation, 
get the benefits promised to them, and we 
thank him for his leadership on this issue.’’ 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, the 
past 18 months have been difficult for 
our 
communities, 
difficult 
for 
all 
Americans. It has been especially un-
bearable for our men and women in 
uniform. 
These brave individuals have pro-
tected us at our lowest moment. The 
least we can do is protect the benefits 
they have earned and stand with them. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ), who is a com-
mitted emergency medicine physician 
and chair of the Hispanic Caucus and 
co-chair of the bipartisan COVID–19 
Task Force. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of S. 1511, the Protecting 
America’s First Responders Act. This 
bill will go a long way in supporting 
the families of fallen officers and im-
proving the Public Safety Officers’ 
Benefits Program. 
Improving the PSOB program has 
been a longstanding priority of mine. 
In fact, today’s legislation includes a 
provision from my bill, the Heroes Les-
ley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Re-
sponders Survivors Support Act, which 
fixes the benefit determination date so 
that families don’t lose out on thou-
sands of dollars because of bureau-
cratic delays. 
In addition to passing today’s legisla-
tion, we must also increase the PSOB 
death and disability benefit to get our 
law enforcement families the benefits 
they have earned and deserve. 
I look forward to working with 
Chairman NADLER to build on today’s 
success and passing my bill, the First 
Responders Survivors Support Act, to 
raise the PSOB benefit this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the families of our Nation’s 
law enforcement officers and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the Protecting America’s 
First Responders Act. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY), another 
committed advocate for first respond-
ers and who has continued his work on 
that issue. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Protecting America’s 
First Responders Act. This is an impor-
tant bill that includes a provision that 
I have worked on for the last three 
Congresses to extend the PSOB pro-
gram to fire police officers. 
A dozen States have officers des-
ignated by law as fire police, who pro-
vide critical support at the scenes of 
fires, explosions, and serious accidents. 
They secure the perimeter so that 
other first responders can do their 
work safely. 
However, because there is no uniform 
national designation for fire police, the 
current PSOB program doesn’t cover 
these officers, even if they are killed or 
seriously injured on the job, which 
sadly has occurred. 
It is only right that they receive the 
same protection as other public safety 
officers. This bill eliminates this exclu-
sion and ensures that fire police and 
their families get the same benefits 
others do who provide first responder 
work. 
I want to acknowledge the Gales 
Ferry Fire Department and Ledyard, 
Connecticut, 
Fire 
Chief 
Anthony 
Saccone, who has tirelessly advocated 
for fire police over the last few years. 
Thanks to their advocacy and engage-
ment and Mr. PASCRELL’s great sup-
port, we will finally send this fix to the 
President’s desk for signature. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill.

Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers and am prepared to 
close. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
You have seen the bipartisan and bi-
cameral support of this legislation. I 
am grateful for that because I think 
this is an important statement in the 
midst of intense negotiations on Build 
Back Better and the INVEST Act, 
which will be an enormous gift to the 
American people, including our law en-
forcement, 
first 
responders, 
fire-
fighters, and others. We now take a

moment to ensure that there are spe-
cial benefits for public safety officers. 
As I indicated, I had the privilege of 
being in New York at Ground Zero for 
the 20th commemoration and to hear 
stories of family members where the 
pain is still deeply embedded, to see ba-
bies that are relatives of the deceased 
that they never got a chance to see. 
It was an honor to see the children of 
those who perished speak. They were 
just babies when their loved ones lost 
their lives in the line of duty in a brave 
manner. 
The visual that I had in getting to 
that area during the recovery, still 
going on months later, hearing the 
whistle blow, seeing the gurneys come 
in carried by firefighters and others, 
the remains placed gently on that 
gurney makes this even more potent 
and powerful and important to be able 
to help. 
In addition, there are two deputies 
who were wounded in the same tragic 
incident as the death of Deputy Atkins, 
and they, too, need comfort and sup-
port, and potential benefits that are 
necessary for their continued survival. 
I think this legislation impacts any 
number of men and women around this 
Nation. 
Having participated with Local 341 
President Marty Lancton just this past 
weekend at the Fire Memorial in Hous-
ton, Texas, to note those firefighters 
who passed in this last year—some suf-
fering from COVID–19, others that we 
are remembering who died in fires and 
other tragic incidents—this emphasizes 
more and more the importance of this 
legislation. 
The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program is an important program to 
address the terrible circumstances in 
which officers give their lives or are 
disabled due to their actions in the line 
of duty. Now we work to improve and 
strengthen this program in the ways 
we have discussed today. 
I thank the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. PASCRELL) and all of the co-
sponsors. I was glad to also have the 
commitment of our House Judiciary 
Committee as well as the work of Sen-
ator GRASSLEY. 
This is a bipartisan bill that was 
adopted by the Senate by unanimous 
consent, and therefore I ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation so the President can sign it 
into law.

The question was taken.

in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

POLITICS IS THE ART OF THE 
POSSIBLE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, Otto 
von Bismarck, in the 1870s, I believe it 
was, said: ‘‘Politics is the art of the 
possible.’’ It is still true. 
The Build Back Better bill will be the 
art of the possible. It will be good for 
America. It will create jobs. It will 
help the middle class deal with the bur-
dens 
and 
blessings 
of 
children, 
childcare, child tax credits, and edu-
cation. 
It will be a very significant bill 
passed by this Congress to help the 
middle class and help those people who 
haven’t been helped in the past, as the 
Trump tax cuts helped the wealthy. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting for it. I thank the people who 
are creating the art and making this 
possible. Politics is the art of the pos-
sible.

to write the Democrats a blank check

sible from successful individuals and 
businesses. 
Madam Speaker, this is completely 
wrong. We shouldn’t be punishing suc-
cess in America to finance this far-left 
political agenda. It is obvious why Joe 
Biden is pushing so hard for an aggres-
sive expansion of government depend-
ency programs and the dismantling of 
domestic energy production. He wants 
to virtue signal to his globalist pals 
during the United Nations climate 
summit this weekend in Scotland. 
Democrats like Biden are embar-
rassed and ashamed of our country. He 
desperately wants acceptance from Eu-
ropean countries to boost his progres-
sive ego. 
Why do we care what foreign elitists 
think of our country, Madam Speaker? 
Biden needs to prioritize American 
citizens instead of European politi-
cians. 
We do things differently than the 
rest of the world. I am proud of our na-
tional values. The leader of our govern-
ment should take pride in the country 
he leads, too.

WORLD SERIES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Yesterday, I said 
there was going to be breaking news, 
and there is breaking news. Does any-
one know that the great Houston 
Astros are in the World Series, and 
that this Congressperson representing 
Minute Maid and the Houston Astros is 
saying they are in it to win it? 
Madam Speaker, I am challenging 
my sister from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS), 
with Dusty Baker as a coach and stel-
lar baseball people, for some catfish 
and barbecue that you have never 
eaten before, against those Atlanta 
Braves. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Will the 
gentlewoman yield? 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, in Atlanta we are known for 
making history and a little bit of good 
trouble. 
As the home of Congressman John 
Lewis, the home of Hammerin’ Hank 
Aaron, who was an Atlanta Brave, we 
are ready to make history once again 
and win this World Series, just like we 
won the first game last night—and we 
will be ready with a nice southern soul 
food dinner. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I love it. Catfish and barbecue, yes, 
Dusty Baker, and all of our ball hitters 
and Barbara Jordan. We are in it to 
win it. Go Astros.

HINDU HERITAGE MONTH 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Octo-
ber 2021 as Hindu Heritage Month. 
Hinduism is the third largest religion 
in the world. With 3 million devotees in 
the United States, Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District is home to many 
Hindu followers. The Hindu heritage, 
culture, and traditions serve as a 
source of inspiration for the individ-
uals who look to the teachings of Hin-
duism for guidance. 
The Hindu-American community has 
contributed tremendously to our com-
munity, enriching the lives of our citi-
zens. As doctors, lawyers, artists, busi-
ness leaders, and government officials, 
the Hindu community has contributed 
immensely to the State of Georgia and 
our great Nation. This month the 
Hindu community will celebrate their 
heritage by focusing on their culture 
and the traditions rooted in India. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Octo-
ber as Hindu Heritage Month 2021. 
To those celebrating, I wish all a joy-
ous celebration of Hindu Heritage 
Month 2021.

LAS VEGAS IS COMING BACK 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, at the 
height of this pandemic, unemploy-
ment in my home district of Las Vegas 
was over 33 percent—a level not seen 
since the Great Depression. The fabu-
lous Las Vegas Strip shut down, and 
the airport was empty. 
Now, thanks to Democrats, we are 
coming back. Vaccination rates are up, 
unemployment rates are down, and 
travelers are returning. But it is not 
enough to restore the country to where 
we were when COVID hit. We need to 
build back better. This crisis has high-
lighted systemic inequalities that must 
be addressed. 
The Build Back Better agenda offers 
us an opportunity to do just that by 
lifting working families, providing a 
pathway to citizenship, taking historic 
action on climate change, and making 
the wealthy contribute their fair share. 
This is our moment, and we must 
seize it. 
f 
SOUNDING THE ALARM ON THE 
PRESIDENT’S EXECUTIVE ORDERS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, with 
executive order after executive order, 
President Biden dismantled America’s 
energy dominance. In the first days of 
his administration, President Biden 
killed the Keystone pipeline, paused 
new oil and gas production on U.S. 
lands, and destroyed thousands of 
good-paying jobs. 
My 
Republican 
colleagues 
and 
I 
sounded the alarm knowing that this 
type of short-sighted policy would have 
a devastating impact on our economy 
and national security. Now energy 
prices are rising with winter quickly 
approaching, and hidden deep in the 
Democrats’ reconciliation plan is a tax 
on heating your home, Madam Speak-
er, that could leave Americans paying 
50 percent more to keep warm this win-
ter. 
That is absurd. To make it worse, 
President Biden said he doesn’t have a 
near-term answer for America’s energy 
crisis. Well, we Republicans do. We 
have an answer. It starts with revers-
ing Biden’s harmful energy policies and 
investing in American energy. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MS. REASTHER 
EVERETT 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Ms. Reasther 
Everett, 
a 
long-time 
resident 
of 
Westland in Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District, as we mourn her pass-
ing. 
Ms. Everett was best known in the 
community for her volunteer work. As 
coordinator for the Wayne County Re-
tired Senior Volunteer Program, she 
recruited, trained, and assigned volun-
teers. She also served as family service 
advocate for Wayne County Family 
Center facilitating and expediting ad-
aptation to independent living arrange-
ments for residents and aided with 
placement in healthcare services. 
Ms. Everett spearheaded the ‘‘no 
family without Christmas program,’’ 
collecting donations for the homeless 
during 
the 
winter 
holiday 
season. 
Throughout her work with the South-
east Westland Homeowners Associa-
tion, Ms. Everett founded the SWHA 
Community Center where, for many 
years, she operated an after-school pro-
gram for young people. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing the many contributions of 
Ms. Reasther Everett to Westland, 
Wayne County, and Thirteenth District 
Strong, as we honor her memory.

AMERICAN CRISES 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, under 
the failed leadership of Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS, our Nation faces chal-
lenges unlike any we have seen since 
the administration of former President 
Jimmy Carter. 
Hardworking Americans are facing 
an inflation crisis that is driving up 
the price of almost everything we pur-
chase. We are facing a supply chain cri-
sis where people are unable to buy the 
goods and services they need to live 
productive lives. 
We are facing a border crisis where 
our border agents are so overwhelmed

that we cannot account for the drugs 
being smuggled into our country or 
stop potential terrorists from entering 
our Nation. We are facing an energy 
crisis where the price of gas has 
reached a 7-year high and heating costs 
are projected to rise over 50 percent as 
winter nears. 
Every one of these crises are the re-
sult of policies this administration and 
progressive Members of this Congress 
have pursued instead of working to 
help the American people get back on 
their feet. 
It is time to reverse course, cut 
spending, promote good-paying jobs, 
and secure our border. 
f 
OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR MOST 
PRECIOUS RESOURCE 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, prior 
to coming to Congress, I worked in 
education for 20 years. I served as a 
public school elementary teacher, a 
high school counselor, and a middle 
school principal for 101⁄2 years, and I 
can tell you without a doubt that the 
Build Back Better Act is going to be 
transformative for our democracy for 
generations to come. 
The reasons are many, including cli-
mate change and investments in home 
care; however, our investments in our 
children, particularly in early child-
hood education, focusing on expanding 
the child tax credit, universal pre-K 
programs, and making sure we have al-
most universal childcare, will prepare 
our children—our babies—to enter kin-
dergarten hitting the ground running. 
As we know, when we invest in early 
childhood education, we have much 
better health, education, and economic 
outcomes with decreased costs in pris-
on as well as healthcare. 
So this is an exciting time, and I am 
blessed to be a part of this Congress 
during this time. I just want to cele-
brate the Build Back Better Act’s in-
vestment in our youngest, most pre-
cious resource: our babies and our chil-
dren.

HIGHLIGHTING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
WORK OF SENATOR K. MAURICE 
JOHANNESSEN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor today to highlight the work 
of Senator K. Maurice Johannessen in 
northern California who is still work-
ing hard at helping our veterans. 
He was born in Norway many years 
ago, emigrated to the United States, 
and joined the Army in 1953 during the 
Korean war, serving our Nation for 
over 
12 
years. 
In 
1960 
Senator 
Johannessen moved to Redding, Cali-
fornia, 
where 
he 
met 
his 
wife, 
Marianne, and raised a family. 
After several years in local govern-
ment, he was elected to the California 
State Senate where he remained for 9 
years. In the State senate, he chaired 
the Senate Veterans Committee and 
authored over 47 veterans’ bill and no-
tably created the Northern California 
Veterans Cemetery in Igo, California, 
and five new veterans homes around 
the United States. Noticing his com-
mitment to improving support for vet-
erans, in 2002 Governor Grey Davis ap-
pointed him Secretary of the California 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Upon retiring from the senate, Sen-
ator Johannessen didn’t stop serving 
our region. He is still using his own re-
sources and community support to get 
a veterans memorial chapel and a 
state-of-the-art veterans medical clinic 
in Shasta County. 
On behalf of northern California, I 
appreciate Senator Johannessen’s serv-
ice, and I want to thank him for all his 
devotion to our region. 
f 
THE GREAT LAKES: THE INDUS-
TRIAL HEARTLAND OF AMERICA 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thought I would like to place on the 
record this afternoon the fact that very 
important negotiations are going on on 
both sides of the Capitol relative to the 
infrastructure bill and the Build Back 
Better bill, and I just wanted to point 
out to all those who hear my voice that 
there is no one from the Great Lakes a 
party to those dialogues with a major 
position in either Chamber. 
I think it is really important to sen-
sitize those who are in the room that 
whatever they do, don’t forget the in-
dustrial heartland of America. 
Our fine leaders in both parties come 
from both coasts and they come from 
other regions of the country, but the 
industrial heartland is notable by its 
absence in those in the rooms who are 
doing the negotiation. 
I know if we alert them to the fact 
that we exist and that we have huge 
needs ranging from rail freight to sea-
borne commerce to industrial revital-
ization—the list is very long—but I 
just wanted to point that fact out. I 
know if my voice is heard by the ad-
ministration and by those in the re-
spective committees they will respond 
accordingly. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the opportunity to place these words 
on the record. 
f 
THE PRESIDENT’S WAR ON 
AMERICAN ENERGY 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, President Biden’s energy poli-
cies have triggered 7-year high gas 
prices that are hammering American 
families and small business owners. 
Today gas prices are 50 percent higher 
than a year ago. In Montgomery, folks 
are paying $3.09 a gallon, Enterprise 
$3.21, and Eufaula and Troy $3.29. 
At these prices, the average Alabam-
ian will pay about $23 more each week 
on gasoline. That is more than $100 a 
month and $1,200 a year. 
Gas prices impact small businesses, 
too. I am a small business owner, and 
countless small businesses like mine 
that are highly dependent on gas prices 
are being hammered right now by these 
high prices. 
Almost all goods and services must 
be delivered via gas at some point. So 
it is basic economics. When the price of 
gas goes up, the price of everything 
goes up. That is on top of near-record 
inflation being driven by our out-of- 
control government spending. This in-
sanity has to stop or the pain at the 
pump will continue. 
Biden must end his war on American 
energy, and we must defeat his social-
ist tax-and-spend agenda.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2021 
No. 189 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, teach us the mystery 
of life. Help us not to be victims but 
victorious in this season of challenge 
and change. 
Lord, lead us to a place of under-
standing in spite of trials and tribu-
lations. Empower us to triumph be-
cause You love us. Today, instruct our 
lawmakers as they seek to do Your 
will. Inspire them to focus on the prior-
ities of Your providence. 
Lord, show them Your truth so that 
they will be instruments of Your pur-
poses. Transform their lives from a 
hurried succession of days into a walk 
with You that brings enduring peace. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate is going to continue focus-
ing on confirming even more of Presi-
dent Biden’s highly qualified nominees, 
both to serve in his administration and 
for lifetime appointments on the Fed-
eral bench. 
Yesterday, we confirmed three more 
district judges through this Chamber, 
each with bipartisan support. We are 
going to continue today with two more 
nominees, and I hope we can see con-
tinued bipartisan cooperation. 
In less than a year, Senate Demo-
crats have worked swiftly and deci-
sively to fill vacancies on the Federal 
bench with qualified, mainstream, and 
dedicated jurists. We are well on our 
way to making today’s Federal bench 
the most diverse in a long, long time. 
Through September, at least three- 
quarters of President Biden’s circuit- 
level nominees have been people of 
color. 
Let me say that again because that 
makes me proud. Through September, 
at least three-quarters of President 
Biden’s circuit-level nominees have 
been people of color. 
Nearly a third of all of President 
Biden’s nominees are former public de-
fenders, and several of them have im-
pressive backgrounds as civil rights 
lawyers, voting rights champions, and 
experience outside the well-trodden 
path of corporate law or Federal pros-
ecution. 
By focusing intentionally on con-
firming judges that bring both personal 
and professional experience to the judi-
ciary, we are expanding the possibili-
ties of who merits consideration to the 
bench at all. 
Judges, obviously, are an essential 
component of a healthy democracy. We 
will strengthen the public’s trust in a 
fair, independent judiciary if the bench 
better reflects the rich diversity of this 
country, while adhering to the rule of 
law. 
One confirmation at a time, Demo-
crats are swiftly restoring balance to 
our courts, and we are full steam ahead 
to confirm more mainstream and quali-
fied and diverse judges as they become 
available. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, on Build Back 
Better, Mr. President. Yesterday was 
another productive day as we make 
progress towards finalizing President 
Biden’s Build Back Better plan. 
After another vigorous, spirited cau-
cus lunch, meetings continue with Sen-
ate colleagues and members of the 
White House, as well as with the Presi-
dent. An agreement is within arm’s 
length, and we are hopeful that we can 
come to a framework agreement by the 
end of today; but we must—we must— 
continue working a little more to 
make sure it is the best deal possible 
for the American people. 
I am working especially hard to 
strengthen Medicare and make pre-
scription drugs more affordable. Sen-
ator SANDERS has worked hard to push 
for many of these Medicare provisions, 
and I support them. 
At its core, the goals of Build Back 
Better are about restoring the middle 
class in the 21st century; helping peo-
ple who are in the middle class stay 
there; helping people who are strug-
gling to get to the middle class to get 
there; and give more Americans the op-
portunity for good, fulfilling lives and 
better lives for their kids. And, of 
course, we must take bold action to 
tackle the climate crisis, which could 
overwhelm our globe all too quickly if 
we don’t act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7394 
October 27, 2021 
It is an agenda that favors not those 
at the very top, but everyday Ameri-
cans who are struggling to achieve the 
American dream in the 21st century. 
Unfortunately, the past 20 years in 
America have been a story of middle- 
class decline. Even before COVID, the 
Federal Reserve estimated that over 40 
percent of Americans in this day and 
age would still—still—have trouble 
covering an emergency expense of just 
$400, which you can easily incur if you 
have to fix your car, make repairs at 
home, or visit a doctor. 
A few decades ago, the story was very 
different. For much of the post-war 
era, most Americans had confidence 
that if you were willing to work hard, 
you could save a little and you could 
leave something behind for your loved 
ones. Nobody was guaranteed riches, 
but the basic bargain in America was 
that those who put in an honest day’s 
work would be able to make ends meet. 
Build Back Better is precisely—pre-
cisely—about rekindling that faith in 
the American dream. That is no easy 
task. Americans face serious, severe 
challenges today that did not exist in 
the past. Raising a family is more dif-
ficult than ever. The challenges of find-
ing and affording childcare and pre-K 
have grown exponentially. Seniors are 
struggling to afford basic drug care and 
basic drugs. 
These are not luxury items. These 
aren’t handouts or entitlements. These 
are essentials. They are essentials that 
families need in order to work and get 
ahead, and they are oftentimes much, 
much harder to afford than they were 
in the past. 
That is what we mean by providing 
ladders to the middle class and helping 
families stay in the middle class. That 
is what we mean by reviving that 
sunny American optimism, which this 
country has lost in the last few dec-
ades. We have got to get it back, and 
the only way we can get it back is by 
bold action that gives people renewed 
hope in their futures and the future of 
their children. 
The work we do right now will echo 
far into the 21st century. This is the 
best opportunity we have had in a long 
time to make sure that the decades to 
come will offer the same—or even 
greater—opportunities that Americans 
enjoyed in the past. 
And if Democrats keep working to-
gether, if we keep our eye on the ulti-
mate goal, and we keep negotiating to 
find that legislative sweet spot, then 
we will succeed in rewarding the trust 
that the American people have placed 
on us. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in a 
few days, President Biden is set to gas 
up Air Force One and jet to Scotland 
for a global conference about the cli-
mate. According to press coverage, the 
President’s agenda is clear: 
‘‘Biden Wants to Show the World 
He’s Serious About Cutting Emis-
sions.’’ 
‘‘Joe Biden gets real on climate 
change.’’ 
What we are talking about here is a 
meeting to review a plan that failed to 
get its own signatories to meet its un-
enforceable ‘‘commitments;’’ a deal 
that couldn’t compel the world’s larg-
est carbon producer, China, to commit 
to any less than another 9 years of ris-
ing emissions before it starts—starts— 
to turn things around. This is a coun-
try with single companies that emit 
more carbon than nations the size of 
Canada. Let me say that again. China 
is a country with single companies 
that emit more carbon than nations 
the size of Canada. And all the while, 
the United States, from outside the 
deal, cut our emissions more than any 
major country inside the deal. We cut 
our emissions more outside the deal 
than any of the countries inside the 
deal. 
The Biden administration is des-
perately chasing bad deals to win ap-
plause from foreign leaders. That is 
what this is about: signing the Amer-
ican people up for self-inflicted pain for 
no meaningful gain. 
The only thing that is serious about 
President Biden’s environmental agen-
da is the trouble that it is already 
causing right here at home. Our adver-
saries like Russia are salivating over 
big windfalls while working American 
families are already feeling the pain. 
Remember, on day one, this adminis-
tration put a freeze on crucial develop-
ment of domestic energy and killed the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, along with over 
1,000 jobs. Combined with Democrats’ 
flood of inflationary spending, it is no 
wonder consumers are facing the high-
est prices at the pump in 7 years, the 
most expensive home heating forecast 
in more than 12 years, and soaring 
prices on the household goods that are 
costing U.S. manufacturers more to 
make. 
Ah, but wait. There is more. When 
President Biden jets off to next week’s 
summit, his fellow Democrats will be 
busy plotting yet another reckless tax-
ing-and-spending 
spree 
that 
would 
compound the pain with more anti-en-
ergy policies. They want to create new 
taxes on the most affordable and reli-
able forms of American energy that 
would put producers out of business, 
workers out of jobs, and make home 
heating even pricier this winter. They 
want to put billions more into ‘‘envi-
ronmental and social justice block 
grants,’’ whatever that means. They 
want to subsidize the favorite products 
of blue State elites, like electric cars 
and even—listen to this—electric bicy-
cles. 
Democrats also want to pour billions 
of dollars into a made-up government 
work program they are calling the Ci-
vilian Climate Corps—Civilian Climate 
Corps. This is pure socialist wish-ful-
fillment. We already have a worker 
shortage and record numbers of open 
jobs, but Democrats want taxpayers to 
put aside $8 billion for make-work pro-
grams for young, liberal activists that 
they admit ‘‘[wouldn’t] measurably re-
duce emissions.’’ 
Under their latest batch of proposed 
regulations, States that fail to keep 
pace with heavyhanded emissions tar-
gets would face ‘‘consequences’’—con-
sequences like freezes on funds for 
major transportation projects that em-
ploy lots of American workers. They 
want to bully every State to become 
more and more like California. 
Washington Democrats are plowing 
ahead with all this precisely as the 
Ghost of Christmas Future is providing 
us with a cautionary tale from across 
the Atlantic. All across Europe, nat-
ural gas prices have jumped 400 percent 
since the start of the year. Countries 
are scrambling to rediscover and reac-
tivate the reliable systems they had 
left behind to follow the latest fads. 
Thanks in part to the Biden adminis-
tration’s own inaction, Putin’s Russia 
has turned his controlling share of Eu-
ropean gas production into a political 
weapon. 
But instead of heeding this cau-
tionary tale, President Biden seems to 
want to follow suit. His regulations 
have squandered the energy independ-
ence we enjoyed before he took office. 
U.S. imports of Russian oil have dou-
bled. As gas prices soar, his adminis-
tration is reportedly—listen to this— 
asking OPEC to cut us some slack. 
As one academic summed it up, 
‘‘Biden policy promotes a multiyear, 
multitrillion-dollar windfall’’ for ad-
versaries—you heard it—like Russia. 
To raise energy prices while enabling Mos-
cow to tighten its grip over Europe’s energy 
supply is to turbocharge a Russian regime 
that was staggering and showing its age. 
Pain for the American people. Pay-
offs for our adversaries so that Presi-
dent Biden can receive cheers from the 
crowd in Glasgow. Small comfort for 
his own citizens. 
Energy policy isn’t the only place 
where the Biden administration’s deci-
sions 
are 
hurting 
Americans. 
The 
President’s retreat from Afghanistan 
continues to have dangerous and disas-
trous consequences. Yesterday, one 
Pentagon official gave Senators a new 
estimate of how many Americans the 
administration has left behind. The 
count Secretary Austin claimed last 
month—last month—was less than 100. 
That has now risen to 450 Americans 
left behind enemy lines. The Biden ad-
ministration 
spent 
weeks 
insisting 
they only left about 100 Americans be-
hind in Afghanistan when the truth 
was multiple times that. The adminis-
tration has also continued to fail to 
keep its promises to brave Afghan al-
lies. 
Meanwhile, as many warned, the ter-
rorist threat is growing in the wake of 
our retreat. The same Pentagon official

October 27, 2021 
acknowledged that Afghanistan-based 
ISIS-K and al-Qaida terrorists have the 
intent and are acquiring the capability 
to strike the United States. ISIS-K 
could threaten our homeland in as lit-
tle as 6 months. The Biden administra-
tion still doesn’t have basing or access 
agreements in neighboring countries 
for its supposed plan to hit terrorists 
from ‘‘over the horizon.’’ No wonder 
our adversaries are testing this Presi-
dent’s resolve to protect American per-
sonnel and American interests. 
A complex attack against U.S. forces 
in Syria last week may well have been 
carried out at the behest of Iran. The 
administration isn’t saying. They need 
to come clean about who is responsible 
and how they intend to respond. 
We know Tehran badly wants the 
United States and its partners out of 
Syria and Iraq and to continue to 
threaten Israel and other U.S. part-
ners. What we don’t know is what the 
Biden administration plans to do about 
it. 
Even where progress should be easy, 
this administration finds ways to actu-
ally mess things up. For example, there 
is strong, bipartisan agreement about 
the threat the People’s Republic of 
China poses to international security 
and specifically to American inter-
ests—case in point: Beijing’s recent 
publicly 
reported 
efforts 
to 
test 
hypersonic weapons and advance their 
nuclear capabilities. China is also dra-
matically expanding the naval capa-
bilities that they openly use to harass 
other nations. 
Both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
would welcome a clear and coherent 
China strategy from this administra-
tion, but all we are getting is a mud-
dled mess. A few days ago, no sooner 
did President Biden offer comments on 
his own Taiwan policy then the White 
House staff rapidly walked it back. So 
it makes you want to ask, who is in 
charge over there—the President or the 
Press Secretary? American administra-
tions have a tradition of handling Tai-
wan with something called strategic 
ambiguity. I am afraid the Biden team 
is taking that a little too literally. 
Even they themselves seem to have no 
idea what they are doing. 
President Biden likes to say some-
thing like: Show me your budget, and I 
will tell you what you value. But Presi-
dent Biden’s own request for the de-
fense budget didn’t even keep up with 
President Biden’s inflation. The White 
House proposed to cut defense funding 
after inflation. And here in the Senate, 
Democrats’ 
partisan 
appropriations 
process seems to shortchange defense 
in favor of runaway domestic spending. 
Even their ostensibly China-focused 
bill from earlier this year would not 
have included any funding for the 
kinds of advanced defense capabilities 
that we need to keep pace if it weren’t 
for an amendment offered by Senator 
SASSE. 
Even the NDAA is stuck in limbo. 
The defense authorization bill is our 
most basic opportunity to shape secu-
rity policy. It is a core duty for the 
Senate majority, the bare minimum, 
but Democrats have completely ne-
glected the NDAA and the traditional 
robust and real floor process that it 
will need. They are too busy debating 
how much socialism to unleash on the 
country to look out for our troops, our 
veterans, and our national security. 
This unseriousness will leave Ameri-
cans less safe. It is just that simple.

EXECUTIVES SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Omar Antonio 
Williams, of Connecticut, to be United 
States District Judge for the District 
of Connecticut. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to seek unanimous 
consent to proceed to the consideration 
of two very qualified nominees to 
USAID. They are the kind of nominees 
who, in previous Congresses, would 
have been approved, without debate, 
through voice vote. I will make the 
motion, expecting, unfortunately, an 
objection. Then I will proceed to com-
ments on why I think this is incredibly 
damaging to the United States to not 
proceed forward with these nominees. 
Thus, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations: Calendar No. 
323 and Calendar No. 337; that the 
nominations be confirmed; that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order on the 
nominations; that any related state-
ments be printed in the RECORD; and 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. 
MARSHALL. 
Mr. 
President, 
EcoHealth Alliance received hundreds 
of millions of dollars in taxpayer 
grants and contracts, including $65 mil-
lion from USAID. This company and 
their research may well hold in their 
hands the smoking gun to getting to 
the bottom of COVID’s origins, and 
millions of families who lost loved ones 
deserve closure. 
Any Federal Agency that has given 
them money must be transparent and 
provide Congress all information on 
what EcoHealth used that money for. 
We asked for this information months 
ago. USAID has failed to do so, and 
that is why I am here to object to these 
two unanimous consent requests. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would 
just ask unanimous consent for two in-
credibly 
qualified, 
noncontroversial 
Administrators at USAID. 
Isobel Coleman is the nominee to be 
the USAID Deputy Administrator. She 
is a seasoned foreign policy profes-
sional who has been nominated by the 
President to oversee and provide stra-
tegic leadership over the Agency’s pro-
grams. She has been previously con-
firmed by this body by unanimous con-
sent. There are, as far as I can tell, no 
objections to her candidacy based upon 
the merits of it; and there were no ob-
jections to her candidacy to serve as 
our Ambassador to the U.N. for Man-
agement and Reform in December of 
2014. She is a former Ambassador, and 
she has spent 20 years in the study and 
practice of global development. She 
has worked in the public and the pri-
vate sectors. 
I ask unanimous consent to proceed 
to the nomination of Marcela Escobari, 
the nominee for USAID Assistant Ad-
ministrator for Latin America and the 
Caribbean. Ms. Escobari is a regional 
expert on Latin America and the Carib-
bean. She has previously served in the 
exact same role at the Agency, and she 
has done really incredible work rein-
forcing U.S. support work for Peace Co-
lombia. She has been heavily engaged 
in the long-term development plan for 
Haiti, as well as in Congress’s plans to 
double funding for Central America to 
try to stem the root causes of migra-
tion. 
I think it is incredibly concerning 
that this blockade of capable dip-
lomats, professional diplomats, con-
tinues on the Senate floor. By this 
time in the Trump administration, 
President Trump had had 22 Ambas-
sadors who had been confirmed by the 
U.S. Senate, 17 of them by voice vote. 
Thus far, President Biden has had 4 
Ambassadors confirmed. 
Today, I was asking for consideration 
not of Ambassadors but of profes-
sionals who oversee the expenditure of 
U.S. taxpayer dollars abroad. There is 
nothing that Senate Republicans can 
do to stop the expenditure of taxpayer 
dollars in the Caribbean or Latin 
America. What they are preventing is 
the appointment and seating of individ-
uals who oversee that funding, who 
represent us abroad. 
This blockade—this unprecedented 
blockade—has never happened before in 
the history of the Senate. This kind of 
obstruction of standing in the way of 
the President’s diplomatic team being 
seated compromises our national secu-
rity. It makes us weaker as a nation. 
As the President heads to the G20, he 
doesn’t have Ambassadors seated to

most of the countries with which he is 
going to be conducting diplomatic ne-
gotiations 
and 
relations. 
USAID, 
today, only has two Senate-confirmed 
positions, leaving most of its top lead-
ership positions vacant. 
So forgive my sense of outrage when 
I listen to the minority leader come 
down to the Senate floor and chide the 
Biden administration for not having a 
strong enough policy in the Middle 
East when his minority is using its 
power to block Ambassadors to the 
Middle East and is using its power to 
stop an Assistant Secretary to the Mid-
dle East from being seated. 
You can’t have it both ways. You 
can’t come down to the Senate floor 
and eviscerate the President’s foreign 
policy and then deliberately stop him 
from having the personnel to conduct 
that foreign policy. It is like tying 
your buddy’s hands behind his back and 
then criticizing him for not fighting 
back against a bully. 
USAID is at the center of our COVID 
response. There is no way to protect 
this Nation from this pandemic or fu-
ture pandemics if we don’t have indi-
viduals who are confirmed at the top 
echelons of USAID. 
I understand Senator MARSHALL’s ob-
jection to be over questions he has 
about gain-of-function research that 
may or may not have been conducted 
in Wuhan. 
What does Marcela Escobari—the 
nominee to be the USAID Assistant 
Administrator for Latin America and 
the Caribbean—have to do with gain-of- 
function research in China? 
First of all, I can show you fact 
check after fact check that suggests 
these allegations about gain-of-func-
tion research being funded in China are 
false, but even if the Senator thinks 
there is a legitimate question, what 
does that have to do with our ability to 
efficiently spend taxpayer dollars in 
Latin America and the Caribbean? 
We just had two massive national 
disasters happen in Haiti. USAID is 
managing that response. It is spending 
taxpayer dollars right now. 
Why wouldn’t we want to have some-
body overseeing that spending? Why is 
that a responsible exercise of U.S. tax-
payer dollars to deny our taxpayers the 
ability to know that there is someone, 
confirmed by the Senate, overseeing 
the expenditure of their money in 
places like Haiti? 
How do you complain about the bor-
der and then deny the President the 
personnel necessary to oversee migra-
tion from the Northern Triangle north-
ward to the U.S. border? 
One 
of 
the 
nominees 
we 
snuck 
through was the Assistant Secretary 
for 
the 
Western 
Hemisphere, 
but 
USAID, right now, is engaged in pro-
gramming designed to stabilize the 
economic and security environment in 
the Northern Triangle. I think both 
parties agree that this is a key compo-
nent of our strategy to prevent migra-
tion that ends in crises at the border. 
Once again, the Republicans are de-
nying the President the ability to have 
personnel in place that will address the 
border crisis. Once again, the minority 
is denying the President the ability to 
have people in place who could oversee 
our COVID response. Once again, the 
minority is denying the President the 
ability to have people in place who will 
oversee our strategy in the Middle 
East. 
This is an attempt to decapitate 
American diplomacy. This is an at-
tempt to stop the President from being 
able to conduct the business of the ex-
ecutive branch. Never before has this 
happened. Never before has the minor-
ity used this amount of its power to 
slow down the confirmation of Ambas-
sadors. 
Yes, we can spend floor time on every 
single one of these Assistant Adminis-
trators, but we have never done that 
before. When it comes to somebody 
like Marcela Escobari or Isobel Cole-
man—people who are nonpolitical, who 
are unquestionably qualified to do 
these jobs—we have approved those 
kinds of nominations through unani-
mous consent. They have proceeded by 
voice vote because to require hours of 
debate on every single one of these 
nominees would be to gum up the 
works of the U.S. Senate. 
That is why we have had this infor-
mal agreement over the years. It is in 
order to move these kinds of non-
controversial, nonpolitical nominees 
expeditiously. That agreement, obvi-
ously, has fallen apart, and the cost 
not only comes to the reputation and 
the comity of the U.S. Senate but to 
the security of the Nation. 
You cannot complain about this 
President’s foreign policy, as Repub-
licans, if you are, at the same time, 
using extraordinary powers to deny the 
President the ability to have diplomats 
abroad to represent us. It is making us 
weaker as a nation, and it should stop 
immediately. 
I am very sorry that the Senator 
from Kansas has come to the floor to 
object to two incredibly qualified, non-
controversial nominees to USAID. I 
hope this blockade comes to an end 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

the quorum call be rescinded.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

RECONCILIATION AND THE GREEN NEW DEAL 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is an-
other day and another really bad idea 
that is coming from the Democrats to 
fund their reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. It seems like, to fund this mas-
sive amount of spending, they are try-
ing desperately to come up with new 
revenue sources, so much so that, as of 
yesterday, still under consideration 
was a tax on unrealized gains—in other 
words, on income that people haven’t 
received yet. 
Let’s just put that into perspective. 
If carried to its full conclusion and it 
became a precedent as part of the tax 
policy in this country—and it never 
has been before—to put it in terms for 
people to understand, a lot of people 
participate in the 401(k) or they have 
some sort of retirement plan from their 
employers. If there were a gain in a 
particular year—say that the total 
value of the portfolios of assets in their 
retirement plans, those 401(k)s, went 
up by 20 percent—they could be taxed 
on that 20 percent even though they 
haven’t received the income yet. 
That is what is being talked about 
here in terms of precedent. Never be-
fore has that been attempted or tried 
or implemented in American history, 
where you would actually have a tax 
on income before people actually ever 
received the income. 
Of course, if you carry that to its 
natural conclusion, as we all know, 
markets go up and markets go down. If 
you had a year wherein your total 
value went down by 20 percent, then 
what? Do you get a refund from the 
Federal 
Government? 
My 
under-
standing is that they would offer some 
sort of a tax credit, in a case like that, 
if you had a year when you had losses. 
Just think about the precedent that 
would establish, what that could mean 
for the American people, if at some 
point the government literally could 
tax you—tax you—on income that you 
hadn’t received yet. 
That is the latest really horrible idea 
which I think is being shot down by 
Democrats 
because 
they 
recognize 
what a horrible idea that is. But it is a 
good example of the desperate lengths 
to which Democrats are trying to come 
up with new ways to fund this reckless 
tax-and-spending spree that they seem 
to be insistent on trying to force 
through Congress. With an evenly di-
vided Senate and evenly divided House 
of Representatives, it is hard to imag-
ine that you could do something that 
radical, but this entire proposal is that 
radical, which is why they are having 
such a hard time getting even people in 
their own caucuses to agree with it. 
Two years ago, Democrats introduced 
their original Green New Deal resolu-
tion. While the guiding principles of 
the Green New Deal was climate 
change and energy, Democrats didn’t 
limit themselves to these issues. They 
outlined a radical, comprehensive so-
cialist revamping of our society with 
the 
Federal 
Government 
inserting 
itself into nearly every aspect of Amer-
ican life. And while Democrats haven’t 
advanced one all-inclusive bill to im-
plement the Green New Deal—probably 
because of the absolutely staggering 
pricetag for a comprehensive piece of 
legislation like that—the Green New

October 27, 2021 
Deal socialist vision has rapidly be-
come an organizing principle of the 
Democratic Party. For proof, look no 
further 
than 
the 
tax-and-spending 
spree Democrats are contemplating 
with its massive expansion of govern-
ment and radical climate agenda. 
One major problem with the Demo-
crats is they never fully consider the 
cost of their legislation, whether it is 
the actual dollar amount or other costs 
their proposals might impose. And no-
where—nowhere—is that more true 
than with the Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree. 
I have spent a lot of time on the floor 
talking about things like the way this 
bill will further drive up inflation and 
the dangers it imposes for economic 
growth. Today, I want to address some 
of the costs of the bill’s Green New 
Deal-esque energy provisions, starting 
with the cost to American families. 
We know some energy prices are in-
creasing due to the rising demand from 
the lows of the pandemic. Yesterday’s 
average price for a gallon of gas was 
$3.38. That is compared to an average 
price of $2.16 1 year earlier. Meanwhile, 
natural gas prices recently hit a 7-year 
high, and there are mounting concerns 
about supply. 
Americans are paying a lot more to 
drive their cars, to heat their homes, 
and to cook their food. The high cost of 
gasoline and natural gas are two more 
reasons why Americans are finding 
that their paychecks don’t stretch as 
far these days. 
Given the situation, you would think 
that finding ways to lower energy costs 
would be among Democrats’ top prior-
ities right now, but you would be 
wrong. 
Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending 
spree isn’t going to lower energy 
prices; it is going to drive them even 
higher. 
The new energy policies that Demo-
crats are considering would drive up 
the price of electricity, natural gas, 
and gasoline and subsidize Democrats’ 
preferred technologies with Americans’ 
tax dollars. And the icing on the cake 
is that Americans are likely to be pay-
ing higher electric costs for possibly 
worse electric service. 
A lot of Americans are familiar with 
the problems with California’s electric 
grid—namely, 
blackouts. 
Well, 
if 
Democrats have their way, Americans 
around the country will be able to 
enjoy California-style electricity; in 
other words, expensive and incon-
sistent electricity delivery along with 
higher gas prices. 
This is what I mean when I talk 
about Democrats not fully considering 
the costs. Nobody—nobody—questions 
that clean energy is a good thing. I 
have been a strong supporter—a strong 
supporter—of clean energy innovation. 
My State of South Dakota leads the 
way, whether it is wind energy, biofuel, 
or hydropower. Most of the energy gen-
erated in the State of South Dakota 
comes from renewable sources. In 2020, 
83 percent of the electricity generated 
in my State of South Dakota came 
from renewable sources. 
But clean energy policies need to be 
realistic and practical for each region 
of the country. We have to, for exam-
ple, understand that we are not yet at 
the point, innovationwise, where we 
can rely mostly on intermittent renew-
able sources to power electric grids. We 
need reliable baseload power from 
sources like clean natural gas and nu-
clear. Additionally, forcing older elec-
tric plants to close before the end of 
their remaining useful life, especially 
the most modern and efficient ones, 
will strand those assets. Our utilities 
make long-term investments, and when 
they can’t recoup those facility invest-
ments, they pass the costs on to con-
sumers. 
Overreaching clean energy policies 
that place heavy burdens on working 
families are unacceptable. Wealthy 
Democratic politicians and the wealthy 
donor class that supports them may 
not have to worry much if they have to 
spend more on their electric bill or an 
extra $20 to $25 filling up their gas 
tank. But that is a big deal to a family 
on a budget, especially when that fam-
ily is also dealing with the increased 
price of food and other basics. 
Thanks to inflation and other pres-
sures on gas prices, Americans are al-
ready having to spend a lot more 
money to fill their gas tanks, and with 
the Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree, 
many working families would end up 
unable to fill their gas tank when they 
need to in a diminished oil and gas sec-
tor. Maybe that is the goal of some of 
the more extreme members of the 
Democratic Party, but it is an unac-
ceptable one. 
Working families are likely to have a 
tough time thanks to the energy provi-
sions in the Democrats’ tax-and-spend-
ing spree, but wealthy families should 
do a little better. Not only are they 
more likely to be able to afford in-
creases in the price of electricity and 
gas, but they will also be able to claim 
a tax credit from the Federal Govern-
ment if they want to purchase an ex-
pensive electric vehicle. 
Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree 
will offer tax credits of up to $12,500 for 
the purchase of an electric car or truck 
with the biggest credit naturally going 
to those who purchase union-made ve-
hicles. 
That is right. Only electric vehicles 
produced at facilities under a union-ne-
gotiated collective bargaining agree-
ment would be eligible for the $4,500 
plus-up, which would take the credit up 
to $12,500. And anyone making up to 
$400,000 a year will be able to claim this 
credit. 
That is right. 
Under Democrats’ legislation, you 
could be making nearly half a million 
dollars a year and still receive a sub-
stantial tax break for the purchase of 
an electric car. 
Meanwhile, more accessible and read-
ily 
available 
clean 
energy 
tech-
nologies—notably, 
biofuels—take 
a 
backseat in this bill. 
Electric vehicles are Democrats’ cho-
sen winner in the transportation sec-
tor, no matter how impractical they 
may still be for a lot of working Ameri-
cans. 
Speaking of impractical, if you want 
an electric bike to go along with your 
electric car, Democrats will also give 
you a tax credit for that as well. Yes, 
the Democrats’ bill contains a tax 
credit for electric bicycles—a credit 
that would go to bicycles that can cost 
up to $8,000. 
Now, maybe it is just me, but if you 
can afford an $8,000 electric bike, I am 
not sure you need a tax credit for it 
from the Federal Government. Also, 
while electric bicycles may have their 
appeal in urban and maybe some subur-
ban communities, they are a com-
pletely impractical option for most in-
dividuals in States like South Dakota. 
When you live 20 miles away from the 
nearest grocery store, an electric bicy-
cle is not going to be your vehicle of 
choice for getting around. And I am 
pretty sure that South Dakota agricul-
tural producers will back me up when I 
say that electric bicycles are not going 
to be much use for getting out to check 
the fences in the far corners of their 
ranch. 
However, I have got to say that tax 
credits for electric bicycles are far 
from the most wasteful use of govern-
ment money in this bill. That honor 
may have to go for the new tax credit 
to higher education institutions for 
teaching environmental justice pro-
grams. That is right. I am sure Ameri-
cans will be relieved to know that 
Democrats are planning to create a 
new tax credit for higher education in-
stitutions—including 
Ivy 
league 
schools and other well-funded univer-
sities—so that they can teach courses 
on environmental justice, whatever 
that is. You would think colleges that 
charge students tens of thousands, if 
not hundreds of thousands, of dollars in 
tuition could perhaps afford to fund 
their own environmental justice pro-
grams. But, again, I guess you would be 
wrong. 
Then there is the $3 billion the bill 
provides for tree equity—tree equity. 
Now, I support and encourage the 
planting of trees, and I have introduced 
a straightforward bill to rapidly ex-
pand tree planting across the country 
without any Federal spending. But I 
am fairly sure the Federal Government 
cannot afford to spend $3 billion on 
tree equity, especially when Democrats 
need to save money for their civilian 
climate corps—a new government pro-
gram to provide government jobs and 
subsidized housing to climate activists. 
There is so much more. 
The word is that Democrats will soon 
be releasing a new version of their tax- 
and-spending spree, and I can only hope 
that it will be less extreme than the 
current version because if the bill’s 
current Green New Deal-esque energy 
provisions go into effect, Americans 
are going to be looking at a future of 
higher energy costs, diminished energy 
resources, and a weakened energy inde-
pendence, not to mention a lot of wast-
ed taxpayer dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7399 
October 27, 2021 
and control our Supreme Court, just 
like big industries have captured and 
controlled regulatory agencies through 
history. 
In these speeches, I have covered the 
origins, motivations, and central play-
ers in the scheme; and, today, I am 
here to respond to a little bit of 
counterprogramming from the scheme. 
So, obviously, Job 1, if you have cap-
tured an agency, is to pretend it is not 
captured; it is still legit. 
Well, on Thursday, the minority 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, one of the 
principal operatives of the court cap-
ture scheme, traveled to The Heritage 
Foundation, one of the central dark- 
money groups in the court capture 
scheme, to toast Justice Clarence 
Thomas, one of the most ardent jus-
tices in pursuing the scheme’s donors’ 
goals and purposes. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
opened 
by 
lauding Justice Thomas for his cam-
paign to overturn decades of precedent 
protecting 
women’s 
constitutional 
right to abortion. That is an important 
point to note because the court is set 
to take up not one but two cases offer-
ing the new 6–3 Republican majority a 
chance to tear down Roe v. Wade. 
But his other mission was to defend 
the court capture scheme, and that is 
an important mission right now be-
cause the court just hit an all-time low 
on Gallup’s national approval survey. 
According to a poll out this month by 
one of the most respected pollsters in 
the country, about two-thirds of Amer-
icans think politics guides the Su-
preme Court’s decisions. And that is 
not a partisan opinion. Republicans 
and Democrats share that view in 
equal proportion. 
And Americans aren’t wrong. When 
big Republican donor interests come 
before the Court, they win—it looks 
like every time. I have shown the pat-
tern. I have published an article on it. 
It is currently at 80 to 0. Lawyers 
would love to take evidence like that— 
an 80-to-0 record—into court as pattern 
evidence of bias. 
So when the evidence is bad, what do 
you do? You blow smoke. There is an 
old, old propaganda technique of accus-
ing your adversary of the exact wrong 
you are committing. It is such an old 
propaganda technique that it even has 
a Latin name: the ‘‘tu quoque fallacy,’’ 
from the Latin for ‘‘you too.’’ The Ox-
ford English Dictionary defines it as 
‘‘retorting a charge upon one’s ac-
cuser.’’ It is a rhetorical trick. 
At 
Heritage, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL 
used this rhetorical trick, retorting a 
charge that critics like me of what has 
happened to the Court were trying to 
politicize the Court. Now, that is a par-
ticularly tricky version of this rhetor-
ical trick because it is an accusation of 
something that we did not do, coming 
from people who actually did that. 
We have all seen in plain view the 
mischief done by Senate Republicans 
to capture the Court for big special in-
terests. They weren’t even subtle. So 
the ‘‘tu quoque’’ rhetorical trick says 
to accuse us of what they did. 
The Republican leader’s rhetorical 
charge stood on a Supreme Court brief 
that I wrote, along with a number of 
my colleagues. And in that brief, we 
quoted 
a 
Quinnipiac 
poll. 
That 
Quinnipiac poll showed that a majority 
of American voters believe the Court 
is—and I quote the poll here—‘‘moti-
vated mainly by politics’’—‘‘motivated 
mainly by politics’’ and the poll con-
tinued that those voters believed the 
Supreme Court should be—and, here, I 
am quoting the poll—‘‘restructured in 
order to reduce the influence of poli-
tics.’’ That is the language from the 
poll question. And in our brief, we 
quoted it precisely. 
In his telling, Senator MCCONNELL 
leaves out the quotation marks and 
turns 
what 
was 
essentially 
an 
uncontested observation of fact of what 
that poll said, using the language of 
that poll, into what the rightwing has 
constantly replayed and cooked up as a 
threat to the Court. He also suggested 
that I had called for expansion of the 
Court, which I have actually not done. 
But never let the facts get in the way 
of a good story, huh? 
In his telling, the majority leader’s 
telling, it is Democrats who are up to 
no good at the Court. Let’s look at 
what that telling leaves out because it 
masks a lot. 
First, it masks the Court’s partisan 
record, the record I have described: 
Justice Thomas and his fellow Repub-
lican appointees in the 5-to-4 and now 
6-to-3 majority on the Robert’s Court 
has handed down over 80 partisan 5-to- 
4 decisions benefiting easily identified 
Republican donor interests. Like I said, 
by my reckoning, it is an 80-to-0 record 
for the big donors. His telling masks 
all of that. 
It also masks the entire Republican 
Court-packing operation that yielded 
three donor-selected Justices and hun-
dreds of lower court judges during the 
Trump Presidency. 
It masks the big donors’ nominations 
turnstile at the Federalist Society, 
where they decided who would and 
would not become a Justice. It was 
insourced to the White House for it to 
vet and select Trump nominees. 
It masks the dark money political at-
tack groups, which used massive anon-
ymous donations to apply political 
pressure on behalf of the donors’ nomi-
nees. 
And it masks Leonard Leo and the 
shady $250 million web of dark money 
groups outed by the Washington Post 
for packing and influencing the Court. 
What else does it mask? It masks the 
influence operation built to steer those 
Justices’ attention to rightwing donor 
priorities. 
It masks the armada of amici cu-
riae—so-called friends of the court—ap-
pearing before the Court by the orches-
trated dozen, funded by dark money. 
It masks the dark money front 
groups that comb the country for cases 
that can catapult selected controver-
sies before the Court to help the Jus-
tices change precedent; it masks the 
special interest fast lane those front 
groups have established to get cases 
quickly before the Court, a fast lane 
the Court indulges; and it masks the 
hot house dark money so-called think 
tanks, like the Heritage Foundation 
where 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
spoke, 
where legal theories benefiting Big 
Donor interests are planted and wa-
tered and fertilized and propagated for 
the Court to adopt. 
And, last, it masks what Republicans 
did, shredding norms and rules that the 
Senate had long relied on to manage 
judicial nominations, the scrapping of 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
filibuster; 
the 
scrapping of the circuit court blue slip; 
the acceptance of preposterous asser-
tions of executive privilege to hide 
nominees’ records; the refusal to grant 
Merrick Garland so much as courtesy 
visits, let alone a hearing; the inven-
tion of the so-called Garland rule about 
not confirming Justices near an elec-
tion; the mad rush to confirm Brett 
Kavanaugh under the cloud of barely 
examined sexual assault allegations; 
and then the hypocritical full 180 re-
versing that so-called Garland rule to 
jam a rightwing Justice onto the Court 
8 days before an election. 
This was all done in plain view. This 
was not subtle. You have got to be 
gaslighting really hard to not pay at-
tention to all that evidence. 
I will tell you what, we weren’t the 
only ones watching. The American peo-
ple are watching, and they are fed up 
with all of this. They trust their noses, 
and they know this reeks. 
Senator MCCONNELL and I do agree 
on one thing. There are, as he said, 
‘‘storm clouds’’ swirling around the 
Court. 
I also agree with him when he said 
this; he said: 
One of our country’s two major political 
movements has decided they’re fed up with 
trying to win the contest of ideas within the 
institutions the framers left us and would 
rather take aim at the institutions them-
selves. 
That statement is exactly true. It is 
just that Senator MCCONNELL got ex-
actly wrong which party is the guilty 
one. Against that litany of interference 
and influence and dark money all 
around the Court that I just described, 
one misquote from a brief—it is not 
even a contest. 
Here is a final quotation to set next 
to Senator MCCONNELL’s. It comes from 
Lewis Powell a few months before he 
took his seat on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. In a memo he wrote to one of 
the most significant forces in Repub-
lican politics, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce—a memo, by the way, that 
was never disclosed to the Senate dur-
ing his confirmation proceedings. Here 
is what he wrote: 
Under our constitutional system, espe-
cially with an activist-minded Supreme 
Court, the judiciary may be the most impor-
tant instrument for social, economic and po-
litical change. 
Powell branded the courts a major 
element of what he called ‘‘The Ne-
glected Political Arena’’ that Big Busi-
ness and rightwing ideologues should

move in and exploit. Exploiting that is 
exactly 
what 
the 
rightwing 
donor 
scheme is. It enmired the Court in dark 
money influence. It packed the judici-
ary with judges selected to rule in the 
big donors’ favor. It won an 80-to-0 rout 
of partisan decisions benefiting Big 
Donor interests. And it is steering the 
Court to protect the dark money that 
was the prime vehicle for capturing the 
Court in the first place. 
Oh, yes, indeed, the Court has been 
politicized, but look at the evidence. 
We weren’t the ones who did it, and no 
amount of smoke can obscure the evi-
dence of how this Court became the 
Court that dark money built. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after 
months of—well, I won’t call it infight-
ing; I will call it intraparty negoti-
ating, our Democratic colleagues are 
still trying to reach an agreement on 
their 
multitrillion-dollar 
tax-and- 
spending spree legislation. They have 
yet to decide how much money they 
want to spend. I think they started— 
the Senator from Vermont started at 
$6 trillion, and then we heard it was 
$3.5 trillion. Now we are hearing that it 
may be more on the order of what the 
Senator from West Virginia said was 
his cap of $1.5 trillion. We still also 
don’t know how much they are willing 
to raise taxes to cover the cost or how 
far they want to move America into a 
European welfare state. 
Still, our colleagues are trying to 
reach a deal in a matter of days. Our 
colleagues are rushing to compile the 
largest peacetime tax hike in Amer-
ican history and see just how much 
government 
overreach 
those 
hard- 
earned tax dollars can buy. 
Some Members experienced buyer’s 
remorse before even swiping the tax-
payers’ credit card, so our colleagues 
are trying to scale back this massive 
spending bill. We read, but we don’t 
know, but it is reported that they have 
cut certain programs, like free college, 
which, despite the name, we know that 
free programs actually cost money be-
cause somebody has to pay for them. 
We also read that they are scaling back 
other plans, including paid leave and 
the expanded child tax credit, to reduce 
the short-term costs and hope for more 
money down the line. 
I think, if truth be told, once these 
policies are established, many times 
they are very difficult to repeal later 
on, which is why they are trying to es-
tablish a toehold even for a short pe-
riod of time. But even with these 
pared-down proposals, there is still 
plenty of government overreach to go 
around. 
One of the biggest dreams of our 
Democratic colleagues is government- 
run healthcare. We have heard the left 
embrace Medicare for All as its ral-
lying cry. Well, the Senator who popu-
larized that policy is now chairman of 
the Senate Budget Committee, Senator 
SANDERS, and he wields a lot of power 
when it comes to this particular tax- 
and-spending bill. It is no surprise that 
his top priority is a dramatic expan-
sion of Medicare. 
Initially, we read that our colleagues 
wanted to lower the age of Medicare 
eligibility by 5 or 10 years, making tens 
of millions of younger Americans eligi-
ble for this benefit. This, of course, 
comes at a time when Medicare is in fi-
nancial trouble already. In just 5 years, 
the trust fund for Medicare Part A is 
scheduled to go insolvent. 
It hardly seems right, while your 
boat is in danger of sinking, to add 
more and more people into the boat. 
Instead of fixing those problems or pro-
viding stability for Medicare, our col-
leagues want to spread those waning 
dollars even thinner. 
The sky-high cost of expanding eligi-
bility seems to have eliminated that 
provision. Again, this is based on re-
porting since no one has actually seen 
the documents, but a massive expan-
sion of benefits apparently is still 
being 
discussed. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget Office has estimated that this 
expansion would cost more than $350 
billion in the first 10 years. We will see 
if the chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee is able to keep this provision off 
the chopping block. 
But this is only part of the plan to 
put the government in greater control 
of our daily lives—of all Americans’ 
daily lives. Another big-ticket item 
which certainly must poll well is free 
childcare. Again, nothing is free; it just 
means somebody—not you—is having 
to pay for it. But free programs, as it 
turns out, don’t come cheap. In this 
case, the original pricetag was pegged 
at $450 billion. 
The American people won’t just pay 
more in taxes to cover this program; 
many families will end up spending 
more on childcare. One left-leaning 
think tank analyzed the impact of this 
free childcare bill and found that it is 
likely to have a devastating impact on 
middle-class families. According to the 
People’s Policy Project, the Demo-
crats’ childcare plan would cause mid-
dle-class families to pay more than 
$13,000 more a year in childcare. That 
is not just a price increase for the top 
1 percent; that is for people who earn 
more than their State’s median in-
come, which in Texas is just under 
$62,000. It is hard to imagine a family 
of four who brings home $62,000 a year 
having an extra $13,000 to spend on 
childcare, especially when they are al-
ready being pummeled by inflation and 
rising costs. 
We will see all the ways that Presi-
dent Biden was wrong when he said 
that ‘‘my Build Back Better agenda 
costs zero dollars.’’ Of course, nobody 
believes that, but the President keeps 
saying it over and over and over again. 
But the American people are pretty 
smart, and they understand when the 
wool is being pulled over their eyes or 
when they are being sold a bill of goods 
by saying: Yeah, we are going to spend 
$3.5 trillion, but it is actually going to 
cost zero. It is really an insult to their 
intelligence. 
Our colleagues across the aisle have 
also proposed a litany of tax increases 
on families, workers, and small busi-
nesses to cover part of the costs of this 
massive spending bill, and they hope 
the increase in the size and power of 
the Internal Revenue Service will 
make sure that Big Brother doesn’t 
miss anything. 
The administration wants to double 
the size of the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice by increasing the number of agents 
by 15 percent every year for the next 
decade. Well, we have already seen 
what a politically motivated IRS can 
do. We know about the leaking of tax-
payer information recently, and we re-
member the IRS targeting controversy 
during the Obama administration. IRS 
bureaucrats 
subjected 
conservative 
groups to a double standard when it 
came to scrutiny compared to left- 
leaning nonprofit groups, and it looks 
like the Biden administration may 
want to dust off that old playbook. 
The administration also wants to 
give the IRS unprecedented power to 
snoop in your bank account. The ad-
ministration proposed requiring banks 
to give the IRS data on accounts with 
more than $600 in annual transactions. 
So that means every time you bought a 
washing machine or a refrigerator, you 
paid your rent, maybe paid your mort-
gage, maybe bought a car, that infor-
mation would be reported to the IRS. 
The IRS already knows how much you 
earn because that is reported, but that 
is apparently not enough for the IRS 
surveillance. They want to make sure 
that the IRS, like Big Brother, knows 
everything you do, everywhere you go, 
and who you associate with. 
Well, this was a $600 annual trans-
action minimum, and, of course, that is 
for an entire year. It is easy to see how 
that would swoop up virtually every-
body in this new government surveil-
lance program. This obviously is not 
designed to catch billionaires evading 
their tax responsibilities. It is tough to 
imagine somebody who wouldn’t get 
caught up in that threshold over the 
course of an entire year. A single 
month of rent is higher than 600 bucks 
in most Texas cities. 
Well, we know what happened. The 
blowback was so fierce that our Demo-
cratic colleagues said: Well, it is not 
going to be $600 a year. We will up it to 
$10,000 a year. But, yeah, we will con-
tinue the surveillance of your personal 
private financial information just so 
we are sure we don’t miss anybody. 
Well, even at a threshold of $10,000, a 
widow who gets a monthly stipend 
from Social Security for $1,500 a month 
would obviously be a target of IRS 
snooping under this proposal. 
It is pretty obvious this is a huge vio-
lation of personal privacy, and people 
are rightfully angry about it. I think 
people are angry because they don’t 
want to be presumed to be a tax cheat 
by their own government. I have re-
ceived letters from nearly 60,000 of my

constituents who are opposed to such 
massive government overreach and in-
vasion of their privacy. 
We know it is also an incredible fi-
nancial and paperwork burden on fi-
nancial 
institutions—community 
banks, credit unions, and the like. 
Imagine the time and the people and 
the hours necessary to comply with 
this new surveillance by your own gov-
ernment. Transmitting the sensitive fi-
nancial information of almost every 
customer of a bank or financial institu-
tion to the IRS would involve a lot of 
time and a lot of money that these 
banks or credit unions may or may not 
have. 
I have cosponsored a bill with Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT from South Carolina to 
prevent 
the 
IRS 
from 
monitoring 
American citizens’ private financial in-
formation, and I was pleased to see our 
colleague from West Virginia, Senator 
MANCHIN, cast doubt on the future of 
this controversial and unnecessary pro-
vision. 
The truth is, it doesn’t matter if the 
pricetag of this bill is $5.5 trillion, $3.5 
trillion, or $1.5 trillion; the goal is the 
same: to permanently transform Amer-
ica and the role that government plays 
in our everyday lives. Whether that is 
through 
the 
healthcare 
system, 
childcare, or through the IRS, there is 
no line too sacred to cross in pursuit of 
this 
ideological 
nirvana. 
Our 
col-
leagues 
continue 
working 
behind 
closed doors to determine just how 
much socialism they want to force on 
the American people. 
We still don’t know how much this 
bill will cost—again, nobody has seen it 
yet outside of the small group of Demo-
crats who are actually negotiating—or 
how much harm it will actually inflict. 
But we do know one thing: This is not 
what the American people bargained 
for in the last election. The American 
voters elected a 50–50 Senate, reduced 
the Democratic majority in the House, 
and took President Biden at his word 
when he promised to work in a bipar-
tisan fashion across the aisle. This is 
not what the American people bar-
gained for. They did not vote to make 
Joe Biden the next FDR, and they did 
not vote to have this Build Back Better 
bill be the next New Deal. 
We will continue, once we are able to 
find out precisely what is in this bill, 
to do everything we can to fight 
against this irresponsible taxing-and- 
spending bonanza. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in favor of the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 
in the expectation that the body will 
soon have a vote to proceed to debate 
on the bill, to proceed to debate in a 
forum before the American public, with 
an offer to our Republican colleagues 
to offer amendments, offer improve-
ments, offer adjustments. This is in-
credibly important. 
We had a vote on the Freedom to 
Vote Act last week, a bill that I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of, along with 
the Presiding Officer. And I am proud 
to be a cosponsor of the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
What does the John Lewis bill do? It 
basically does two things. First, it re-
stores a vigorous preclearance require-
ment that was part of the original Vot-
ing Rights Act, section 5, that was 
struck down by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in 2013 in the Shelby v. Mis-
sissippi opinion. 
The Supreme Court in Shelby said 
that you could have a preclearance re-
quirement but you couldn’t apply that 
requirement only to the geographic ju-
risdictions that were covered in the 
original 1965 act; Congress would have 
to analyze and come up with a new set 
of criteria for who should have to get 
preclearance done. 
The second thing the John Lewis bill 
does is it responds to a Supreme Court 
decision that was decided this summer, 
Brnovich v. Democratic National Com-
mittee, to specifically lay out the ele-
ments of a claim under section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act—a claim that a 
local election practice or a State prac-
tice dilutes the strength of minority 
voting. 
The preclearance requirement is the 
one that is the most important to me 
because, as a former mayor and Gov-
ernor of Virginia, of Richmond and 
then the Commonwealth of Virginia, I 
lived under preclearance requirements, 
and I will spend a little bit of time 
talking about what that is like because 
it is actually pretty easy and pretty 
helpful. 
But the way the John Lewis bill, in 
my view, very adroitly fixes the Shelby 
problem is it says: OK. Starting now, 
we are not going to treat the South dif-
ferently than anywhere else in the 
country; we will treat every part of the 
country exactly the same. You are sub-
ject to a preclearance requirement as a 
State government or a local govern-
ment if you have had a pattern of Vot-
ing Rights Act violations during the 
previous 25 years. 
If you had just one, that isn’t 
enough. This has to have been a pat-
tern. And if there has been a pattern of 
Voting Rights Act violations, you are 
subject to preclearance. You have to 
submit proposed electoral changes to 
the Justice Department, and you have 
to keep doing that until you have had 
10 years in a row where you haven’t 
been subject to any voting rights viola-
tion. 
So it doesn’t penalize the South. 
Every ZIP Code in this country— 
North, South, East, West, Midwest—is 
only subject to preclearance if there 
has been a pattern of voting rights vio-
lations—a significant pattern—over the 
previous 25 years. And as soon as you 
have 10 years without a voting rights 
violation, 
you 
can 
‘‘bail 
out’’ 
of 
preclearance, and you don’t have to 
submit your electoral changes to the 
Justice Department anymore, unless 
you commit new violations. 
How reasonable. How reasonable. 
We would want to have additional 
scrutiny of jurisdictions’ voting rights 
practices if they have committed vot-
ing rights violations. 
I was a city councilman and mayor of 
Richmond from 1994 until 2001. And 
every time we changed a polling place 
or did redistricting after a census or 
contemplated new rules about the tim-
ing in primary elections, we had to 
submit it to the Justice Department 
for a preclearance because Richmond— 
the capital of the Confederacy—had a 
documented history of suppressing mi-
nority vote for a very long time. 
I was the Governor of Virginia—Lieu-
tenant Governor and Governor—from 
2002 until 2010. And the same thing at 
the State level: when we did redis-
tricting after censuses, when we con-
templated in our legislature new vot-
ing rules, we had to submit to the Jus-
tice Department, preclearance require-
ment. We would send it to them 90 days 
before the proposed change would go 
into effect. The Justice Department 
would analyze the change. And then 
they, almost in every instance, in my 
experience, would reach back out and 
say: That is fine. Your change is fine. 
You can go ahead and implement it. 
Sometimes they would reach out and 
say: We have a question or could you 
think about this; might you make an 
adjustment? So it was a dialogue. And 
that dialogue was productive. 
And then the Justice Department 
would give Richmond or Virginia a 
green light and we would make those 
changes and we would make them with 
some assurance. It was actually help-
ful. It was helpful to run a change by 
the Justice Department and have it 
looked at by voting rights experts to 
make sure that we weren’t unwit-
tingly, we weren’t intentionally—but 
that we weren’t unwittingly doing any-
thing that would suppress anyone’s 
votes. 
And once we got that preclearance 
green light, we would move ahead with 
the voting changes with confidence. It 
was simple. It was easy. It was a stand-
ard practice that we were all used to. It 
didn’t impose any additional burden or 
time on the city government or the 
State government. 
And so it deeply troubles me that 
colleagues of mine now are reluctant to 
go back to a vigorous preclearance re-
quirement for jurisdictions that have 
had an established pattern of voting 
rights violations. This preclearance fix 
in the John Lewis Act is extremely im-
portant. 
Two more points. I want to plead 
with my colleagues in the GOP—the 
Republican Party—on this bill, and 
then I want to express my sense of ur-
gency about it. 
By my reading of our history, the Re-
publican Party throughout most of its 
life has been a great voting rights 
party—a great voting rights party. In 
the aftermath of the Civil War, it was 
the Republican-led Senate and House 
that passed the 15th Amendment—the

constitutional prohibition against any 
jurisdiction using race to disqualify a 
voter. 
I would like to say that the Demo-
crats in the late 1860s were supportive 
of those provisions; it was the Repub-
lican Party, frankly, that got the Con-
stitution improved by passing the 15th 
Amendment. 
The 19th Amendment, pages, guaran-
teed women the right to vote. Now, 
that was done in a Democratic admin-
istration, President Woodrow Wilson, 
at a time when Congress was majority 
Democrat, but it was done with the full 
support of the Republican Party. The 
19th Amendment had strong Repub-
lican Party support. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which 
the John Lewis bill goes in and 
amends—it was done at the time that 
Democrats had the majority in this 
body, but it would not have happened 
without Senate Republicans. In fact, 
Senate Republican were more sup-
portive of the Voting Rights Act than 
were Senate Democrats in 1965. 
So there has been a pattern—1870, 
1919, 1965—of the Republican Party 
being a party through much of its life— 
being a party that was interested in ex-
panding the franchise and encouraging 
more people to vote. 
It happened again when Richard 
Nixon was President. 
The 26th Amendment, pages, giving 
18-year-olds the right to vote, changing 
the Federal voting age in Federal elec-
tions from 21 to 18, that was done under 
President Richard Nixon—again, with 
both Republican and Democratic sup-
port. 
The Voting Rights Act, after it was 
passed in 1965, had to be reauthorized 
every 5 or 10 years. And it was often re-
authorized by unanimous vote, with 
Republican Senators largely being on 
board. 
It really only was about the time of 
the beginning of the Obama Presi-
dency, frankly, that the GOP, which 
had been rock-solid stalwarts for ex-
panding the franchise, began to change. 
When 
the 
Shelby 
decision 
was 
reached in 2013, it was just a couple of 
years after the Voting Rights Act had 
been reauthorized with solid and over-
whelming Republican support. 
And this particular fix in the John 
Lewis bill to say, OK, preclearance; we 
are not going to put a scarlet letter on 
you if you are in a Southern State; we 
will have everyone precleared if you 
had a pattern of demonstrated voting 
rights violations—we went to Repub-
lican colleagues with that in a bill near 
immediately after the Shelby decision 
and were not able to find even one— 
even one—Republican in the House or 
in the Senate that would sponsor a fix 
to this bill. 
It is my hope that when we call this 
vote up in the next couple of days that 
colleagues of mine in the Grand Old 
Party, who have had this more than 
century-long tradition of being a party 
willing to expand the franchise and en-
courage people to vote, will reclaim 
their own heritage and decide to be a 
pro-voting rights party. 
Last thing, sense of urgency. I was 
not only the mayor of Richmond and 
the Governor of Virginia—a State with 
a significant African-American popu-
lation and a State with a very notable 
history, a challenging history, a pain-
ful history, a triumphant history as 
well; like most history, Virginia his-
tory is so mixed; there is so much pain 
and tragedy and triumph and hard to 
make sense out of it—but I have al-
ways been passionate for voting rights 
because of my understanding of our 
history and, particularly, the dis-
enfranchisement that African Ameri-
cans, women, and others have faced. 
One thing I have never faced, though, 
is I have never faced disenfranchise-
ment. I have been a supporter of voting 
rights for those who have. I was a civil 
rights lawyer. I did voting rights cases. 
So I have been a supporter. I have been 
an ally. I have been an advocate. But 
never in my life—never in my life—did 
I feel like TIM KAINE, a Caucasian male 
born in 1958—that somebody was trying 
to disenfranchise me. 
I had that experience for 1 day of my 
life. And as passionate as I was before 
that 1 day, I now understand this in a 
completely different way. That day was 
January 6, 2021. As we were here in the 
Capitol and the Capitol was under at-
tack by people who were attacking to 
try to stop the certification of the No-
vember 2020 election, they were basi-
cally trying to disenfranchise 81 mil-
lion people who had voted for Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS. 
And my overwhelming reaction that 
day was complicated, and I was having 
a hard time figuring out what I was 
feeling. Even when we heard gunshots, 
even when we were being escorted and 
could see the rampagers not far from 
us, I was not afraid; I was furious. I 
wasn’t feeling fear; I was feeling anger. 
And I realized later that that anger 
stemmed from the fact that at age 62, 
almost 63, for the first time in my life, 
just for a moment, I had a sense of 
what it meant to have someone else 
trying to disenfranchise me. 
Many of my friends and constituents 
in Richmond—they have felt that sense 
for their entire lives. They felt it very 
personally. They feel it very person-
ally. They hate that feeling. They want 
us to be that small ‘‘d’’ democracy, 
where everyone can participate. I had 
never felt that personally, but on that 
day, I did. And that day gave me just a 
glimpse—just a glimpse—of how dev-
astating, demoralizing, frightening, an-
gering it is to know that society is try-
ing to keep you away from participa-
tion. 
So that experience, which was just 
for a day because on January 7 I was 
back to my norm, where no one was 
trying to disenfranchise me—and yet 
those actions that are being taken in 
statehouses around this country to 
take away people’s rights to partici-
pate, they mean something different to 
me than they did on January 5 because 
I had that one moment where I felt like 
this is me. 
I sort of hated that day, but if it took 
that day to help me realize the impor-
tance of this issue, then that day had a 
purpose in my life that was not just a 
negative purpose, a positive one. And it 
is my deep hope that both parties, as 
we have before—Democrats and Repub-
licans—will join together to protect 
people’s rights to participate in this 
greatest democracy on Earth. 
I look forward to this debate. I look 
forward to getting a voting rights pro-
tection measure that is meaningful 
through this body, as has happened be-
fore. If we can do it here, we will be 
honoring a history, where, even when 
it has been tough, we have been able to 
do it. And we can do it again. 
And with that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, begin-
ning in his first days in office, Presi-
dent Biden paused all oil and gas leas-
ing on Federal lands and then killed 
the thousands of jobs supported by the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Fast forward to 
today, prices at the pump are more 
than 40 percent increased from a year 
ago. Home heating costs have increased 
by more than 20 percent going into the 
winter. 
Under President Biden’s new policies, 
instead of reducing this burden on 
hard-working 
Arkansans, 
President 
Biden has made it clear that his agenda 
trumps the needs of American families 
and is doubling down with his new 
reckless, energy-destroying spending 
bill that will only increase these costs. 
This far-left Democrat wish list 
makes the undeliverable promises, pro-
poses to dramatically drive up costs for 
every American, would eliminate thou-
sands of jobs in the energy sector, and 
would accelerate our already rapid in-
flation. 
This is not a realistic approach to ad-
dress our country’s environmental en-
ergy needs. Heavyhanded rules that re-
duced energy supplies are likewise 
counterproductive. 
We should not turn our back on the 
existing energy sources that we have in 
North America that lower gas prices 
and reduce our dependence on oil from 
unstable regions. American manufac-
turers need long-term access to afford-
able energy so our country can com-
pete globally against nations with 
much lower environmental standards. 
Also, in the event of a national secu-
rity or energy crisis, for example, ac-
cess to our resources will be essential. 
Bureaucratic overreach and unwar-
ranted spending will not only drive up 
energy costs on consumers but will 
also do the most harm to low- and mid-
dle-income families. Think of the im-
pact this would have on single moms 
and seniors on fixed incomes. These 
families are most affected by burden-
some regulations and can least afford a 
costly, unworkable energy policy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7403 
October 27, 2021 
We must continue to use an all-of- 
the-above approach to diversify our Na-
tion’s energy portfolio. Working to in-
crease exploration and production of 
natural gas and oil, continuing the de-
velopment and use of coal, along with 
support for renewable and nuclear en-
ergy, should all play a role in our na-
tional energy strategy. America’s en-
ergy supply should be diverse, stable, 
and affordable. 
President Biden is pushing hard to 
get Congress to agree to his plans in 
time for this week’s climate summit. It 
is fitting that the summit is in Scot-
land, as European nations have shown 
us the dangers in addressing climate 
change the wrong way. 
Poorly conceived mandates to elimi-
nate fossil fuels have resulted in a cav-
alcade of problems for agriculture 
across the continent. 
Surging natural gas prices have re-
sulted in fertilizer plants closing, cre-
ated a food-grade CO2 shortage crisis 
that is hurting pork and poultry proc-
essing. Beverage producers are also fac-
ing the same challenge getting CO2, 
leading to the likely scenario of wide-
spread disruption across the food and 
beverage sector. 
Our friends in the UK went heavy on 
wind power only to have the wind stop 
blowing, forcing energy companies to 
scramble for gas reserves, and con-
sumers to face much higher bills. 
As ranking member on the Agri-
culture Committee, I take these warn-
ings very, very seriously. The Presi-
dent’s plan would be an absolute gut 
punch to our Nation’s family farmers 
and rural America as a whole, espe-
cially as inflation continues to sky-
rocket 
under 
this 
administration’s 
watch. 
The cost of farming is on the rise. 
Land, fuel, seed, fertilizer, and live-
stock feed prices are all increasing. 
Soaring costs of inputs come at a time 
when the farm economy had only re-
cently begun to turn a corner. Now 
with further increases, farmers, once 
again, face the possibility of a down-
turn in the farm economy as profits 
dwindle. 
Propane—heavily relied upon in rural 
America for agricultural production 
and home heating—has seen prices al-
most double this year. In fact, market 
experts are predicting an ‘‘Armaged-
don’’ as we head toward the winter. 
Now President Biden and his allies in 
Congress would enact policies that dou-
ble down on economic hardship by 
eliminating affordable sources of en-
ergy, particularly those relied upon in 
rural America. 
Much 
of 
the 
President’s 
agenda 
comes directly from the Green New 
Deal, a far-left agenda that most Amer-
icans have roundly rejected. Working 
with President Trump, we successfully 
fought off the Green New Deal. Now 
President Biden wants to resurrect it 
and rebrand it as ‘‘Build Back Better.’’ 
Given the troubles Democrats have 
had writing their bill, it seems that 
America doesn’t want it either. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, a 
number of us are down on the Senate 
floor here talking about the disastrous 
Biden 
administration 
policies 
that 
from day one—day one—have sought to 
increase energy prices and put Amer-
ican workers out of work. 
How have they been doing that? 
Well, they are shutting down the pro-
duction of American energy. All over 
the country, they are going after infra-
structure, particularly pipelines, not 
allowing those to be built. 
They have energy or climate czars 
not confirmed by the Senate—John 
Kerry, Gina McCarthy—who are going 
to financial intuitions in America say-
ing: Don’t invest in American energy. 
And then we are hearing reports that 
John Kerry is going to countries in 
Asia, saying: Don’t buy American LNG. 
You can’t make this stuff up. 
Two days ago in the Washington 
Post, another story. John Kerry was 
saying to President Biden: Hey, we 
have to be softer on China so we can 
get them to maybe commit a promise 
that they will never keep in Scotland. 
You can’t make this up. Let’s be soft. 
The Chinese are mad about us raising 
issues about Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
John Kerry is saying maybe we should 
tone that down to get the Communist 
Party of China to agree to some empty 
promises on climate. You can’t make 
this up. 
So what we are seeing is spiking en-
ergy prices at the pump for working 
families. Here is the question every-
body should be asking—I hope our 
friends in the media ask it, certainly— 
of the Biden administration: Is this in-
tentional? Are you really trying to 
drive up energy prices that is hurting 
working families? 
My view is, I think the answer is yes. 
The President had a townhall last 
week. He seemed to not have a clue 
about a bunch of issues, but particu-
larly on energy prices. 
And just yesterday, there was an ar-
ticle about how Gina McCarthy was 
quoted as saying there will be opportu-
nities with these high energy prices: 
Soaring commodity prices stemming from 
a surge in energy demand and limited sup-
ply, should accelerate the move to renew-
ables around the world. 
This is a senior Biden administration 
official saying: Hey, we are actually 
trying to drive these prices up. Sorry, 
working families in America. Winter is 
coming. You are really going to be 
hurting. Maybe the world will move to 
renewables. 
You can’t make this up. 
To me, this is one of the biggest be-
trayals of working families and work-
ing men and women in U.S. history: an 
administration coming in on purpose 
to drive up energy prices—Gina McCar-
thy says so—knowing it is going to 
hurt working families. 
Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if 
President Biden will be calling on our 
citizens to wear a Jimmy Carter-style 
cardigan soon. 
What they are doing is building back 
better to the seventies: high inflation; 
gas lines; high energy prices; empty 
shelves; lack of workers; energy-pro-
ducing adversaries, like Russia, em-
powered; begging OPEC to produce 
more oil. That is literally what is 
going on. 
Madam President, we have a much 
better plan. In the next few weeks, 
some 
of 
my 
colleagues—Senator 
CRAMER, Senator LUMMIS, and a num-
ber of others—we are going to be put-
ting forward a plan on what is working. 
We need to build on what is working in 
America. 
Let me give you a couple of statistics 
that matter. Since 2005, the United 
States has reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions by almost 15 percent, more 
than any other major economy in the 
world. That is a fact. You don’t hear it 
from President Biden. Heck, the Sec-
retary of Energy thinks we are the sin-
ner. They don’t recognize China as pro-
ducing almost three times the amount 
of greenhouse gas emissions than we 
are. Estimates are that 100 percent of 
the increase in global greenhouse gas 
emissions are going to come from non-
industrialized countries—China, India, 
others—yet they are putting all the 
pain on Americans. 
If we export and continue to export 
clean-burning American natural gas as 
we currently do to India, to China, to 
Korea, to Japan, that could have a 
huge impact on reducing global green-
house gas emissions. 
So what we are going to be doing is 
we are going to be working with oth-
ers—we certainly want some of our 
Democratic colleagues to join this 
commonsense approach. 
The American Energy, Jobs, and Cli-
mate Plan is focused on all-of-the- 
above energy using technology—yes, 
building out the renewable sector in 
conjunction with our other energy that 
we currently have; empowering Amer-
ican workers; not giving him and her 
pink slips, which is the Biden way; en-
acting reform; knowing that we need 
other resources, like critical minerals 
that we have in abundance in Alaska 
and America, for the renewable sector; 
permanent reform so we can bring all 
energy projects online—oil, gas, renew-
able, nuclear, all of the above. That is 
the power; and, of course, using our re-
sources to leverage our foreign policy 
advantage over our allies. 
As we start rolling out our plan, we 
need to compare it with the Biden 
Green New Deal. We need to compare it 
with the Biden Green New Deal. Just 
look at the comparison, what we are 
going to be doing over here in the blue 
with our plan and what the President 
and his team—no offense to some of my 
colleagues, led by a number of them— 
on the Green New Deal. 
We will create millions of jobs. They 
are putting people out of work as we 
speak. 
We have the ability to reduce global 
greenhouse gas emissions. They are

going to China to get empty promises 
from dictators—not going to work, no 
matter how much John Kerry kowtows 
to the Communists. 
We are going to restore energy domi-
nance. They want to crush it. 
We want to invest in manufacturing 
and other elements that will produce 
millions 
of 
jobs 
for 
working-class 
Americans. Right now, they want to 
rely on China to source everything we 
have in America. 
And, of course, we want reasonable 
energy prices. And, as I already men-
tioned, Gina McCarthy and others are 
trying to drive up American energy 
costs on Americans’ backs so they can 
go to Europe, drink a glass of wine, and 
tell them how well they are doing in 
terms of crushing our energy sector. 
The American people don’t want that. 
Our plan is what is supported by the 
American 
people, 
not 
these 
crazy 
Green New Deal policies that are hurt-
ing men and women, particularly work-
ing families and energy sector workers, 
more than any other policy of any ad-
ministration in the history of the 
country. 
I am glad a number of my colleagues 
are down here to continue this discus-
sion. I look forward to participating 
with them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senators 
CAPITO, BARRASSO, LEE, KAINE, and my-
self be allowed to finish our remarks 
before the previously scheduled rollcall 
votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
am pleased to be here and follow my 
good friend, the Senator from the great 
State of Alaska, a State that produces 
an incredible amount of energy, as does 
my State of North Dakota. 
And, of course, we are here to talk 
about how this administration’s poli-
cies are harming America’s energy pro-
ducers and leading to skyrocketing en-
ergy prices. 
Americans are paying more for en-
ergy, whether it is at the gas pump or 
their monthly utility bills. This week, 
the average price of a gallon of gaso-
line in my home State of North Dakota 
is $3.19. That is up from $2.27 in Janu-
ary. That is an increase of almost a 
dollar—about a 50-percent increase. 
Every consumer pays that when they 
pull up to the pump. Of course, that 
hits low-income people disproportion-
ately. 
North Dakotans are also facing high-
er home heating costs for this winter 
with the price of natural gas having al-
most tripled. Same thing: think about 
hard-working men and women who now 
are paying that higher utility bill as a 
result of these policies. Higher energy 
prices drive up the costs of everything 
we consume, and lower-income Ameri-
cans, as I say, are disproportionately 
impacted when a larger share of their 
paycheck must go towards covering 
higher energy costs. 
Last week, the President blamed 
OPEC for higher gas prices. 
Why is our country a global energy 
powerhouse in this situation? 
Just a decade ago, North Dakotans 
helped crack the code on domestic en-
ergy production in the Bakken, helping 
the United States become the world’s 
largest oil and gas producer. We un-
leashed the potential of our abundant 
energy reserves and, as a result, our 
country became a net exporter of en-
ergy in 2019. 
Americans benefited from our energy 
independence through record low en-
ergy prices, as well as strengthen eco-
nomic and national security. Energy 
security is national security, yet, since 
January, President Biden has been say-
ing ‘‘no’’ to America’s energy pro-
ducers. 
The President is blocking new energy 
leases on Federal lands, stifling the op-
portunity to harness our abundant tax-
payer-owned 
energy 
reserves. 
The 
President also killed the Keystone XL 
Pipeline and is actively discouraging 
needed private-sector investment in 
new oil, gas, and coal production. 
Yet this administration allowed com-
pletion of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line, which, of course, moves gas from 
Putin’s Russia into Germany and Eu-
rope. And instead of supporting our 
own domestic energy workforce, the 
Biden administration is asking Russia, 
Saudi Arabia, and the OPEC nations to 
pump more oil. 
Why on Earth are we asking foreign 
countries with less stringent environ-
mental practices to produce more en-
ergy when our own domestic producers 
are ready and willing to answer the 
call? 
Despite this administration’s failed 
policy and corresponding higher energy 
costs, the President and Democrats are 
doubling down on their Green New Deal 
agenda. 
The Democrats’ reckless tax-and- 
spend bill will only worsen today’s high 
energy prices by making American en-
ergy production more expensive and 
less reliable. 
The President’s policies will not only 
increase the pain at the pump, they are 
threatening the ability to keep the 
lights on. These climate policies will 
accelerate the grid’s reliance on inter-
mittent renewable sources of power at 
the expense of always-available base-
load generation from sources like coal 
and nuclear power. 
We need to maintain our baseload 
sources of electric generation that are 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
regardless of weather conditions, to 
keep the lights on and homes warm as 
we enter the winter months. 
And rather than turning to OPEC 
with less stable places in the world— 
our adversaries, in fact, like Russia, an 
adversary—we should be empowering 
our American energy workers to de-
velop our abundant energy reserves 
here at home using the latest and 
greatest technologies to do it with bet-
ter environmental surge. More supply 
of energy means lower costs for con-
sumers. It is as simple as that. 
The President needs to work with us 
to support our domestic energy pro-
ducers and their work to provide low- 
cost, dependable energy to our homes 
and businesses. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first, let me commend my colleague, 
the former Governor of North Dakota 
and now the senior Senator from North 
Dakota, for his very thoughtful com-
ments with which I agree. 
I come to the floor today, as well, to 
talk about energy prices, which we 
know are spiking all across the coun-
try. As the President is soaring off to a 
climate conference in Scotland, energy 
prices are soaring here at home. 
This year alone, we have seen energy 
costs spiking for families all across 
this country. Energy prices have gone 
up not just a little; they have gone up 
a lot. The cost of filling your tank with 
gas is up about $1 a gallon today as 
compared to the day that Joe Biden 
was sworn into office. As a result, my 
constituents in Wyoming are paying 
about $25 to $30 more per tank every 
time they fill up—every time they go 
to the pump—than they would have 
done in January, when Joe Biden was 
sworn in. 
It is not just gasoline prices that are 
up in our cars and trucks; it is natural 
gas prices that are way up—a 7-year 
high for gas at the pump and a 7-year 
high for natural gas. And all of these 
things are impacting people, especially 
as winter is coming. People use natural 
gas to heat their homes and cool their 
homes, and they use natural gas to 
cook. 
Well, you know, it really shouldn’t be 
this way wherein we see these sky-
rocketing prices because, in America, 
we have the largest energy resources in 
the world. Many of them are in my 
home State of Wyoming. 
Under the last Presidential adminis-
tration, America became the largest 
producer of oil and natural gas in the 
world, yet, in what we saw on the first 
day of his administration, President 
Biden declared war on American en-
ergy, on energy produced here at home 
in America. 
On that very first day in office, he 
killed the Keystone XL Pipeline. That 
action immediately ended the jobs of 
thousands of individuals at the height 
of a pandemic. 
President Biden didn’t stop there. He 
went further when he shut down the ex-
ploration of oil and gas in the Arctic. 
He banned oil and gas leasing on Fed-
eral lands and in Federal waters. It was 
ruled illegal, and he did it anyway. 
President Biden’s radical, anti-Amer-
ican energy agenda is hurting our econ-
omy, and people in every State of the 
Union are paying the price and feeling 
the pain today. They are feeling it with 
higher energy bills. Anytime they pay 
an energy bill, they are paying more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7405 
October 27, 2021 
So what do the Democrats want to do 
about this? 
Well, it is pretty obvious they want 
to make it worse. NANCY PELOSI and 
CHUCK SCHUMER are pushing a $3.5 tril-
lion reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
Last month, in the Energy Com-
mittee, of which I am the ranking 
member, one Commissioner of the 
FERC—the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission—had something to say 
about this $3.5 trillion spending bill. He 
said it would be like an ‘‘H bomb’’—an 
‘‘H bomb’’—on America’s electric mar-
kets. That is because the bill that the 
Democrats are trying to push through 
on a party-line vote is actually just the 
disastrous Green New Deal with a new 
name. 
So what is in this bill? 
Well, it would effectively kill coal, 
oil, and natural gas permitting on Fed-
eral lands. It would replicate Califor-
nia’s unreliable electric grid, and it 
would do it on a national scale. The re-
sult would be what they have seen in 
California: rolling blackouts, service 
that is less reliable, and costs that are 
even higher. 
The Democrats’ bill would impose 
punishing new taxes on natural gas 
producers. 
What happens to that? 
Well, of course, these fees would be 
passed along to the consumers. 
Where will they see it? 
Well, in their energy bills. 
It would create a new tax on mining 
firms based on how much dirt they 
moved. The Democrats literally, in 
their legislation, with 40 different 
taxes in it, now have a dirt tax. 
The bill would waste $27 billion on a 
slush fund for environmental activists. 
Now, it is not clear exactly what all of 
this $27 billion would be used for—$27 
billion—but we can be sure that tax-
payers won’t be getting their money 
back. Taxpayers will never see that 
money again. 
How they actually dish out the 
money is completely open-ended, but 
what we do know is it can be used to 
hire environmental activists, armies of 
lawyers and mobs, to protest because 
their goal is to shut down energy and 
our industries and the energy economy, 
harming families and throwing people 
out of work. 
Then, finally, this large bill would 
give huge tax breaks to rich people who 
want to buy electric vehicles. The 
Democrats’ spending bill would give up 
to $12,500 to married couples who make 
as much as $800,000 a year. They would 
get a tax break. All they would need to 
do is buy a luxury electric vehicle. 
The American people are already 
paying high energy prices. They are 
doing it because President Biden is 
blocking American energy. You know 
there isn’t enough supply to meet the 
demand, and the Democrats have com-
plained about it. 
So how do they make the situation 
worse? 
Well, they impose punishing fees; 
they waste billions of taxpayer dollars; 
they shut down the abundant and af-
fordable energy sources that fuel our 
economy. 
And, of course, all of these are good- 
paying jobs. American families can’t 
afford the Democrats’ reckless tax-and- 
spending spree. 
So here we are today with the Presi-
dent’s going off to Scotland. He will be 
there for Halloween, and people around 
this country will be suffering the 
nightmare of high energy costs. Not 
that long ago, we were a nation of en-
ergy wealth and energy dominance, but 
this President and this administration 
have changed it to make us a nation of 
energy weakness and a nation that is 
now dependent upon others for energy. 
The American people wouldn’t be-
lieve that we are, today, using more 
energy and more oil from Russia than 
we are from Alaska, but that is what 
this President has brought to this 
country—a 
jackpot 
for 
Vladimir 
Putin—and energy workers who are out 
of work here at home. It is a disgrace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. 
CAPITO. 
Madam 
President, 
today, I join my colleagues to talk 
about highlighting some of the things 
that we see in the dubious environment 
and energy provisions included in the 
Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending 
proposal and what that will mean to 
the American public. 
This week, the U.S. Energy Informa-
tion Administration, a nonpartisan 
governmental group, forecasted that 
the cost of Americans’ natural gas bills 
will go up 30 percent this winter. We 
are getting ready to get into the cold 
winter season. That means American 
households will spend an average of 
$746 on gas heating in the months from 
October through March—30 percent 
more than last year. 
Now, maybe to some people, $746 
doesn’t sound like much, but if you are 
on a fixed income and you have to pay 
that every month, that means having 
to make difficult decisions. 
Also, with natural gas, which is the 
primary heating fuel for 48 percent of 
American homes, which is nearly half 
the country, this has huge implications 
for our families. 
As I said, just think of retirees in 
West Virginia, who are on fixed in-
comes. That 30-percent increase is huge 
and 
unmanageable. 
People 
already 
struggle to pay their energy bills in 
normal times, but with this increase, 
difficult decisions will have to be made 
in many households. 
Think of a family of four just trying 
to get through—trying to get through 
the school year—and they have just 
enough to buy the necessities for their 
children, and now their heating bill is 
30-percent higher. That is a big hit to 
that family. 
Americans who rely on propane will 
face an even greater price increase, and 
that is a lot of Americans. The EIA 
said it is expecting a 54-percent in-
crease this winter. 
So with Americans facing eye-pop-
ping increases in home heating, Con-
gress should be considering legislation 
that lowers those costs by producing 
more energy here at home; but, in-
stead, the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee reported legislation to im-
pose a methane tax, which would really 
be called a natural gas tax. 
This regressive provision would make 
already high heating costs even worse 
this winter and beyond, and low- and 
middle-income families would suffer 
because we know those costs always 
get passed on. The natural gas tax 
would put jobs in the energy sector in 
my home State at risk. This week, we 
saw reports that this tax may drop out 
of the reconciliation package. Good 
news for me, and it would be good news 
for States like ours. 
But even without a natural gas tax or 
the devastating Clean Electricity Pay-
ment Program, which also is rumored 
to be on the chopping block, the re-
maining provisions in the Democrats’ 
legislation wastes taxpayers’ dollars 
and includes broad, new regulatory 
policies that would change this coun-
try. 
For example, there is the Greenhouse 
Gas Reduction Fund. It is a $27.5 bil-
lion slush fund for Democratic States 
and progressive organizations to fi-
nance 
whatever 
so-called 
green 
projects they may want. 
Apparently, our colleagues are con-
cerned that the over $200 billion we 
have in renewable energy tax credits is 
not enough to encourage the private 
sector to finance projects. Therefore, 
billions of tax dollars are required to 
provide even more public financing for 
their wish list. 
Two other provisions tucked into the 
House bill that have not received much 
attention could have major policy im-
plications. 
First, the House bill includes a $50 
million fund to create a new green-
house gas emissions regulation at the 
EPA, like President Obama’s Clean 
Power Plan. 
My question would be, if the EPA is 
funded, why they would need another 
$50 million to create a program. 
But this provision directs the EPA to 
develop 
overly 
burdensome 
regula-
tions. At the request of 26 States, the 
U.S. Supreme Court stayed President 
Obama’s Clean Power Plan because the 
EPA lacked the statutory authority. 
Yet this $50 million provision, tucked 
into the $3.5 trillion behemoth bill, 
isn’t only about giving more money to 
the EPA; it is designed to give the ad-
ministration the ability to say that fu-
ture climate rules were specifically au-
thorized by the Congress. These rules 
could regulate energy production, man-
ufacturing, 
agriculture—really, 
any 
sector in the U.S. economy—and place 
countless jobs at risk. 
Another separate $50 million provi-
sion directs the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration to come up with a green-
house gas emissions performance meas-
ure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7406 
October 27, 2021 
What is that? 
States would then be required to set 
emissions reduction targets based on 
that performance measure. The Federal 
Highway Administration is also di-
rected 
to 
impose 
consequences 
on 
States that fail to meet these targets. 
How much of a reduction in emis-
sions do States have to achieve to hit 
their targets? What actions will States 
have to take or not take in order to 
meet their targets? More importantly, 
what consequences will the Federal 
Highway Administration impose on our 
States that fail to meet their targets? 
Will they lose their Federal highway 
dollars? Will States have more restric-
tions on building new roads? Will there 
be new requirements to direct highway 
funding to other activities that reduce 
emissions? 
All of those questions are left unan-
swered. 
This $50 million open-ended provi-
sion, reported by the House Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, 
could jeopardize the ability of States 
to build new roads and bridges. 
These are just a few of the erratic en-
vironmental provisions in this reckless 
tax-and-spending spree. Their provi-
sions have not had the careful consid-
eration that they need to have, and 
they have not had the vetting that, I 
think, programs such as these would 
need. 
The package is much broader than 
that. It is really a lot of wasteful 
spending. It is regulatory overreach 
that will make energy and goods more 
expensive. We have talked on and on 
about the rising costs of goods and, 
particularly, gasoline. It is a progres-
sive wish list rolled into a $3.5 trillion 
bill that inserts the government into 
nearly every phase of American life 
from cradle to grave. The reconcili-
ation bill should not pass. 
I will continue to come to the floor, 
along with my colleagues, to shine a 
light on the harmful provisions and 
help inform the American people about 
what really is in this package. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2844 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, in poli-
tics, on television, on social media, and 
pretty much everywhere, it seems that 
people are decrying the surge of ‘‘mis-
information.’’ False information and 
dangerous ideas exist, but the cure to 
factions of falsehood and the kinds of 
harms coming from them was some-
thing that was prescribed in the very 
early days of our Republic. 
James Madison wrote in Federalist 
No. 10 of the value that our large Union 
would always possess in defeating self- 
interested and dangerous ideas and phi-
losophies and specifically factions. The 
answer is simple: Our free society, with 
free exchange of ideas, allows for a 
multiplicity of viewpoints, perspec-
tives, and opinions to be heard, and 
then the true, correct, and useful ideas 
tend to rise to the top. 
Madison wrote: 
The increased variety of parties comprised 
within the Union, increase . . . security. 
At this point, I would add that the 
definition of ‘‘parties’’ here is best un-
derstood to encompass information, 
ideas, and opinions—all things that 
tend to unify people around one faction 
or another, one party or another, one 
group of people or another. 
But, oh, how many have lost their 
way since then. Be it through man-
dates, censorship, cancel culture, or 
something else, it seems that this dia-
logue of ideas and information is being 
rejected by many segments of our soci-
ety. What a shame that is. It is an even 
greater shame that, often, this is the 
result of government action. 
Yesterday, I came to the Senate floor 
with one of my dozen bills to try to 
counteract President Biden’s vaccine 
mandate. This bill that I offered up 
yesterday required only that the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
provide the information the Depart-
ment already has on adverse COVID–19 
vaccine effects to the public. We have 
already got this information. We just 
wanted them to share it with the pub-
lic, with the American taxpayer—those 
who have been footing the bill all 
along. Regrettably, the senior Senator 
from Washington objected to the bill 
and described it as a waste of time and 
one that would somehow undermine 
trust. 
My response to that is simple: Why 
would we ever want the Federal Gov-
ernment to hide any health informa-
tion from Americans? If we want to 
build confidence in these vaccines, and 
we do—I certainly do—then the Federal 
Government must get out of its own 
way and build trust and confidence 
with concerned Americans by sharing 
information. 
Allow me to be abundantly clear. I 
am very much against the vaccine 
mandate, but I am for the vaccine. I 
have been vaccinated. I have encour-
aged others, including my family, to be 
vaccinated, and they have done so. I 
believe these vaccines are miracles. 
They are helping many millions of 
Americans to avoid the harms of 
COVID–19. But there are many Ameri-
cans who are deeply concerned with the 
vaccine. They are not going to be peo-
ple who are simply convinced by cru-
elty or by extortion. 
I have heard from over 300 Utahns 
who are at risk of losing their liveli-
hoods due to this damaging, senseless, 
and immoral mandate. These are not 
our enemies. They are mothers and fa-
thers. They are neighbors. They are 
military servicemembers. They are our 
friends. They deserve more respect 
than being fired, brushed aside, and 
permanently relegated to unemploy-
able, outcast status, which is the inevi-
table consequence of this mandate. 
This is where it naturally leads. 
Now, many of these people would ap-
preciate more information from the 
COVID research that their taxpayer 
dollars are already paying for. One 
would expect that the amount of re-
search should be pretty darn extensive 
considering that as of May 31, 2021, just 
a few months ago, Congress had supple-
mented the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services with approxi-
mately $484 billion in COVID–19 funds. 
That is a lot of money. That is almost 
half a trillion dollars. 
Keep in mind that a trillion dollars 
represents, last I checked, roughly 
$3,000 for every man, woman, and child 
in America—not every taxpayer; not 
every worker; but every man, woman, 
and child in America. This is roughly 
half a trillion, so we are talking some-
where in the neighborhood of $1,500 for 
every man, woman, and child in Amer-
ica. 
This is their money. These are their 
funds. This is money that they worked 
really hard to produce. So it should be 
their information that they have ac-
cess to. But, lamentably, as recent 
news has shown, the National Insti-
tutes of Health often feels the need to 
hide information about its activities 
from the public. So, today, I have come 
to the Senate floor for now the 10th 
time on the vaccine mandate with a so-
lution that should be entirely non-
controversial. 
My bill, the Transparency in COVID– 
19 Research Act, would simply require 
that the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services publish all the studies 
and findings that the Department has 
supported regarding COVID–19. The bill 
provides for the privacy of researchers 
and study participants. The bill would 
better inform Americans about the 
COVID–19 vaccines. The American peo-
ple deserve to have this information. 
After all, they have paid for it, and 
after all, they are now routinely being 
subjected to it whether they want it or 
not. 
Again, this whole exercise should be 
about building trust and confidence in 
the COVID–19 vaccine. That is, after 
all, what we want. You are never going 
to get that through threat, intimida-
tion, extortion. In any event, it is im-
moral action. That is not something we 
can justify. That is not the way to 
treat our friends, our neighbors, our 
servicemembers. 
I am grateful to my colleagues, Sen-
ators BRAUN, LUMMIS, and TUBERVILLE, 
who agree and have joined me as co-
sponsors of the bill. 
Look, if we want the American peo-
ple to be comfortable with the COVID– 
19 vaccines, we should be more than 
comfortable providing the research 
that led to their development and their 
approval. If we want Americans to 
trust their government, we should be 
clear that it does not hide important 
health and research information from 
them. If we want our Republic to func-
tion properly, just like James Madison 
hoped for, then we need to have an 
open dialogue with all the information. 
The bill would be a positive step to-
ward each of these ends, and I encour-
age my colleagues to support it. 
So, Madam President, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent

S7407 
October 27, 2021 
that the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 2844 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; further, I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, we need to 
leave the science to scientists and re-
searchers. Our public health Agencies, 
including the CDC and NIH, already re-
lease their studies publicly, and it is 
important that they have control over 
the release of this information. 
Forcing researchers to put out stud-
ies on an arbitrary timeline—this bill 
requires all studies to be released with-
in 14 days from the passage of the bill— 
could force the release of studies before 
data collection is complete, before they 
are done analyzing and reviewing the 
data, before it is peer reviewed. It 
might force them to put out studies 
that were funded that came to incon-
clusive results that might be confusing 
to the public. 
So I think having a bill that would 
force release of material based on a 
date when a particular bill passed rath-
er than when the science is done and it 
is ready to be released could be a recipe 
for disinformation and distrust. 
The bill seems to imagine a scenario 
where there is critical science being 
hidden away or stonewalled, and I have 
no reason to believe that is true. That 
would be a dangerous suggestion at a 
time when we are trying to encourage 
people to follow the guidance of these 
Agencies, and the Agencies are work-
ing around-the-clock to provide life-
saving cures and up-to-date informa-
tion about how people can keep their 
families safe from COVID. 
Based upon those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is dis-
appointing that we weren’t able to 
take this step today to restore trust 
and confidence with the American peo-
ple in research that they have now 
spent half a trillion dollars conducting. 
I understand the impulse to—as my 
friend and colleague, the distinguished 
Senator from Virginia, put it—to let 
scientists handle science. That doesn’t 
mean, that shouldn’t mean, that must 
never mean that we exclude the Amer-
ican people from the right to access the 
findings of their own government—a 
government that has used their own 
taxpayer dollars to the tune of half a 
trillion dollars just through HHS and 
through 
trillions 
more 
on 
other 
COVID–19-related efforts. We should be 
able to trust the American people to 
access that information, and when we 
hide it, it erodes trust and confidence 
in the very vaccine that President 
Biden is trying to force on all Ameri-
cans, even at the pain of losing their 
jobs.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3086 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
right now, American families are wor-
ried. The White House thinks inflation 
is a high-class problem. I clearly imag-
ine the price of Prada bags has gone up, 
but what the White House continues to 
miss is that inflation is killing the 
buying power of Americans on low and 
fixed incomes. 
Across America, families are going 
through grocery store aisles, seeing 
higher prices, and having to figure out 
what they can afford to eat this week. 
Folks are passing by gas station after 
gas station, looking for lower prices— 
to no avail. These aren’t just headlines 
and stories; these are real families who 
are living paycheck to paycheck and 
struggling to keep up. 
I grew up poor. When my parents’ 
bills went up, it made it more difficult 
for my family. When gas prices went 
up, it meant we had less food to put on 
the table. None of us would wish that 
on anyone, but that is exactly what is 
happening in Biden’s America—high 
prices on food, high prices on gas, 
empty shelves and supply shortages, 
skyrocketing debt, and Big Govern-
ment overreach—and that is just the 
start. Energy prices are through the 
roof. 
Let’s take a look at the rising cost at 
the pump. 
Just this week, the South Florida 
Sun-Sentinel ran a story with the 
headline: ‘‘Gas prices hit their highest 
levels since 2014. When will we get a 
break?’’ As gas prices keep rising, the 
message from Florida couldn’t be more 
clear. 
Last week, the national gas average 
was $3.36 a gallon. It was $2.16 per gal-
lon this time last year. That is a 55- 
percent increase in just 1 year. If you 
are driving a car, that means you are 
seeing an extra cost of about $800 annu-
ally. If you are driving a truck, that 
means you are probably seeing an extra 
cost of $1,400 annually. 
More than 5,000 gas stations across 
the country are charging more than 
$4.50 a gallon. In one California com-
munity, gas was nearly $8 per gallon 
last week. That is insane. Prices may 
go up even more as forecasters warn 
that oil could rise to more than $100 a 
barrel. 
But rising costs don’t stop at the 
pump; they follow you home. For the 
nearly half of U.S. families who use 
natural gas to heat their homes, it is 
going to cost them $746 just to stay 
warm during the winter months. If you 
are using electric heat, prepare to 
spend more than $1,200 on your electric 
bills. Reports show that, this winter, 
home heating prices are going to rise 
by more than 40 percent for homes that 
use heating oil, more than 30 percent 
for homes using natural gas, and 54 
percent for homes using propane. Fac-
tor in the rising cost of meat, diapers, 
milk, and other everyday items, and 
things are looking pretty dire for the 
American family. 
Last week, President Biden said he 
‘‘doesn’t have a near-term answer’’ for 
reducing gas prices. He doesn’t appear 
to have a long-term answer either. In 
the meantime, he expects families to 
just hang tight while he does nothing 
until next year, when things will magi-
cally get better. 
We all know President Biden likes to 
play the blame game. This time, he is 
blaming OPEC for not pumping out 
more foreign oil. Remember when 
America was energy independent? Not 
anymore, thanks to Joe Biden. He has 
done everything in his power to cut off 
America’s domestic supply and re-
sources needed to warm our homes and 
run our cars. 
In his first month in office, he cut 
the Keystone Pipeline permit and 
killed thousands of American jobs. 
Then he suspended new oil and gas 
leasing and drilling permits for Federal 
lands. 
He filled his administration with peo-
ple who have been longtime advocates 
of a carbon tax, including Treasury 
Secretary Yellen, which would only 
make the current problem worse. He 
has others, like Interior Secretary 
Haaland, who want to completely ban 
fracking. 
Oddly enough, he supported Russia’s 
getting the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, 
which gives Russia a massive win, and 
he has put us back into the Paris cli-
mate accords, which are already ruin-
ing Europe. European countries are 
scaling back on oil and gas production 
to meet the Paris Agreement. In Por-
tugal, electricity prices have tripled 
over the past 6 months, and Germany’s 
prices are three times the U.S. average. 
Across Europe, they have to rely on en-
ergy imports from Russia. 
Instead of pursuing a path of energy 
independence, Biden continues to push 
ridiculous energy policies in his mas-
sive $5.5 trillion spending package that 
will cut our legs out from under us and 
cause America to become even more 
dependent on Russia and the OPEC 
countries, and he is relentlessly pur-
suing a reckless tax-and-spending spree 
even though we know reckless spending 
causes inflation. 
These effects might not be felt by 
President Biden, but I can tell you 
that, since Biden took office, more 
families across the State of Florida and 
across the Nation have felt the pain of 
having to count their pennies. 
For the sake of American families, 
we need to figure out what the heck is 
going on. This is why I have introduced 
a very simple bill to get to the bottom 
of these sky-high prices. I am thankful 
for Senators MARSHALL, LUMMIS, CAP-
ITO, JOHNSON, MORAN, and BLACKBURN, 
who have cosponsored this legislation. 
The GAS Price Act will simply re-
quire the Energy Information Adminis-
tration to report publicly to Congress 
on any Federal Agency policies or reg-
ulations that it determines will cause 
energy prices to rise. All my bill does 
is ask a Federal Agency to provide im-
portant information to us in Congress 
with a statement of facts on what is 
causing rising energy prices since 
President Biden was sworn into office. 
Then we can take this information, see 
what needs to be fixed, and help the 
American people. That is it. Let’s tell 
Americans why this is happening, and 
let’s figure out how to fix it. It is as 
simple as that. 
I am sure none of my colleagues 
would disagree to keeping Congress in-
formed about new rules or policies that 
have a negative financial impact on 
families in our great State. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 3086, which is at the 
desk. Further, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I rise to object 
to the Senator from Florida’s request 
to pass this legislation through unani-
mous consent. 
If we want to tackle rising fuel costs, 
let’s do something that will actually 
protect American consumers and actu-
ally promote our energy independence. 
Let’s reinstate the fossil fuel ban that 
was lifted in 2015.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7409 
October 27, 2021 
Listen to what has happened here in 
our Nation since 2015, when every Re-
publican on this Senate floor—when 
they controlled the Senate—voted to 
lift the ban on the exportation of oil 
from the United States. That ban had 
been in place for 50 years to keep 
American oil here. 
Well, here’s what the Republicans did 
in the House and Senate back in 2015: 
they lifted the ban. 
Oil companies from the United States 
now send our oil overseas. And get this: 
In 2020, we exported more than 8.5 mil-
lion barrels of petroleum every single 
day out of the United States to other 
countries. And, in 2020, pursuant to Re-
publican Senators in 2015, we, in 2020, 
for the first time in more than 50 
years, exported more barrels of petro-
leum every single day—exported—than 
imported. 
Is that energy independence? 
I don’t think so. 
And why do we do it? 
I will tell you why we do it. It is for 
the oil companies. That is why we do 
it. 
The Republicans don’t want to do 
anything on climate change—oil com-
panies. The oil companies want to ex-
port American oil, drill for it here in 
the United States, because they can 
make more money selling that oil into 
the 
international 
marketplace. 
Of 
course, that is what the Republicans 
are going to vote for back in 2015. 
And here’s what happened: we got up 
to 2021, and we now are net exporters of 
petroleum in our country. 
So the bill that is being proposed 
would actually do nothing to help con-
sumers at the pump. The one thing 
that we could do is reimpose the ban on 
the exportation of these 8.5 million 
barrels of oil a day. Keep it here. It is 
lower priced. It is drilled for in the 
United States. Our economy would get 
the benefit of that lower priced oil and 
people would be going up to the pump, 
paying a lot less per gallon of gasoline 
than they are doing right now. 
But you are not going to hear any-
thing from the Republican Party that 
takes on the oil industry and their 
international market using American 
oil to make more money because peo-
ple in the rest of the world will pay 
more for it. But that leaves less Amer-
ican oil here for drivers, as they are 
pulling in to the pump every single 
day. 
So this is just the greed of the do-
mestic oil industry so that they can 
have unlimited international energy 
markets so that, ultimately—and this 
is the beauty of it—they make more 
money overseas and they get to tip 
American consumers upside down at 
the pumps as they have got their fin-
gers on this nozzle and watching this 
price of gasoline go up even as they are 
looking at it. It is a beautiful world for 
the oil industry to have the coopera-
tion of the Republican Party on this 
agenda. 
And so all I can say is that this pro-
posal is just the opposite of what we 
should be talking about. The Repub-
licans should be reexamining their own 
conscience about what they did in 2015, 
instead of shedding crocodile tears 
today as though Joe Biden did this. 
This net export of petroleum products 
is a Republican idea driven by the Re-
publicans who sit here on the Senate 
floor. 
And so in no way should this resolu-
tion pass, and so I object to the Sen-
ator’s motion for unanimous consent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. That would be 
interesting if it was true. When you 
think about it—and you can look at oil 
prices, and they are international oil 
prices—it is illogical to believe that 
the American oil companies want to 
spend the transportation dollars to 
send the oil overseas if they could sell 
it in America. 
So, first off, I am truly shocked that 
my colleague would say those things. I 
am shocked that he would object, but I 
get it. I know my Democratic col-
leagues have to bend over backwards to 
protect the Biden administration’s dis-
astrous energy policies. But I find it 
hard to believe they would go so far as 
to object to having basic transparency. 
Maybe, if what my colleague said was 
true, then my bill would show—they 
would come back and say: Yup, that is 
exactly what happened. 
My bill would simply provide us with 
greater insight into the cause of rising 
gas and energy prices in the United 
States. 
We must be committed to making 
the American dream work for every-
one, ensuring that every family, in-
cluding poor families, have a chance to 
get ahead. 
I think about my mom and dad. I 
watched them struggle to make ends 
meet. This inflation, these gas prices, 
food prices, all these things, are hurt-
ing the poorest families in this coun-
try. When you get very little, like we 
did, and prices go up—gas prices, food 
prices—it means it is a very difficult 
time for these families. Hard-working 
families are trying to get by. 
We need to provide more information 
to Congress so we can make good deci-
sions to figure out why these gas prices 
are going up the way they are. 
So I am disappointed that my col-
league would object to a simple way of 
trying to figure out exactly what has 
happened here, why gas prices are 
going up, and what should Congress be 
doing to make sure that doesn’t con-
tinue. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
SENTENCING DISPARITY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to speak on another topic that, 
sadly, is still relevant today as it has 
been for so many years. And I want to 
start by recalling 35 years ago, when I 
was a Member of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, I was faced with one 
of the most troubling votes in my 
whole career. 
It was the height of the war on drugs. 
A new narcotic showed up. It was 
called crack cocaine. We didn’t know 
much about it, but we knew several 
things: First, highly addictive; second, 
dirt cheap; third, if a woman who was 
pregnant used it, she could cause per-
manent harm to the baby she was car-
rying. 
We started worrying that this was 
going to become the drug of choice 
across America and that the war on 
drugs was going to be lost forever. 
And just about the time we were de-
bating this, an event took place that 
really had no direct connection to 
crack cocaine, but it rocked the Cap-
itol. 
There was a basketball player at the 
University of Maryland, whose name 
was Len Bias. He was a very good bas-
ketball player, destined for the NBA. 
Sadly, 
he 
overdosed 
and 
died. 
It 
shocked everyone all across this re-
gion, and it certainly was felt in the 
House of Representatives. And, per-
haps, it was part of the impetus for a 
measure that we enacted, which I later 
came to really regret. 
Congress took action in 1986. I joined 
400 of my House colleagues. We decided 
to take a stand—a really powerful 
stand—against crack cocaine. We de-
cided to create a sentencing regime for 
crack cocaine that would be so over-
whelming that anyone across America 
who considered using it would think 
twice. We went to an extreme. We de-
cided to impose a 100-to-1 disparity be-
tween crack cocaine and powdered co-
caine. 
What does that mean? 
If you are arrested with 5 grams of 
crack, you were subject to the same 
mandatory sentencing as someone ar-
rested with 500 grams of powder co-
caine, a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity. 
Our logic was there. If people knew 
that that kind of penalty awaits, they 
will surely stay away from this deadly 
new narcotic. 
It turned out we were completely 
wrong. The net result of our 100-to-1 
disparity against crack cocaine didn’t 
drive the cost of the drug up on the 
street. It drove it down. It didn’t lessen 
the number of people who were ad-
dicted. It increased the number of who 
were addicted—exactly the opposite of 
what we expected to happen. 
And then for a decade, maybe two 
decades, we reaped the whirlwind. The 
100-to-1 disparity meant that we were 
filling our prisons to a level we had 
never seen in the history of the United 
States, and, frankly, a level the world 
had never seen in terms of prison popu-
lation. Sadly, the vast majority of 
them were African Americans. We stole 
away one or two generations of Afri-
can-American 
males—and 
some 
fe-
males, too—in the process of making 
this terrible mistake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7410 
October 27, 2021 
It didn’t make America any safer at 
all. In fact, it worsened the racial in-
equities in our justice system. Black 
Americans and White Americans use 
drugs at the same rates. Yet Black 
Americans are six times more likely to 
be imprisoned for drugs. 
Fortunately, 
lawmakers 
on 
both 
sides of the aisle recognized this was a 
true injustice. I tried to undo some of 
the damage done by this war on drugs. 
We came together in 2010, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to pass a bill I called the 
Fair Sentencing Act. It lowered the 
Federal drug sentences for the first 
time since the war on drugs. 
Through bipartisan negotiations, we 
were able to significantly reduce the 
crack-powder sentencing disparity, but 
we didn’t eliminate it. We reduced it 
from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. 
You say: How did you come up with 
the number of 18? 
Two opposing Senators—one, myself; 
and the other, Jeff Sessions of Ala-
bama, negotiated it literally in the 
Senate gym. We came to this agree-
ment. We will make it 18-to-1 instead 
of 100-to-1. It is still dramatically high-
er than it should have been, but it was 
also dramatic progress. 
Now, more than a decade later, we 
can finish the job with the EQUAL Act, 
a measure I introduced this year under 
the leadership of my friend and col-
league, Senator CORY
BOOKER. Once 
again, we have been able to come to-
gether on a bipartisan basis, only this 
time we agreed we needed to finish the 
job and end this disparity. 
We have help on the Republican 
side—how about that, a bipartisan ap-
proach—with Senators PORTMAN, PAUL, 
TILLIS, and GRAHAM joining us. 
Our House colleagues overwhelm-
ingly agreed on a bipartisan basis 
themselves to change this once and for 
all, to go back to one-to-one in terms 
of sentencing on crack and powder co-
caine. The legislation passed 361 to 66 
in the House. Not bad, certainly in this 
divided political atmosphere. 
It is amazing. By passing the EQUAL 
Act, the Members of the Senate can 
prove that we can learn from our mis-
takes. 
Addiction, we have come to learn, is 
not a moral failing. It is a disease—a 
treatable disease. And if our Nation’s 
laws encourage people to seek treat-
ment instead of incarcerating them for 
seeking self-medication, we can poten-
tially save tens of thousands of lives 
every year. 
If I had said to the people back in Il-
linois 10 or 15 years ago, I went to them 
and said, ‘‘Did you hear somebody 
downtown last night died of a drug 
overdose?’’ 15 years ago, you would 
have said, ‘‘Oh, that is a darn shame.’’ 
And if I said, ‘‘Try to describe to me 
what you think that person looked 
like, who that person was,’’ they would 
have said, ‘‘My guess is it is an African 
American, probably a male. He is prob-
ably between 20 and 35 years of age.’’ 
And you would have been right 15 
years ago. 
But now we are seeing overdoses, par-
ticularly with opioids and fentanyl, 
that really belie that image, that 
stereotype of the drug addict. We are 
finding drug addiction to opioids reach-
ing every corner of society—Black, 
White and Brown, young and old, peo-
ple who have a lot of money, and peo-
ple who are dirt poor. 
And so we started looking at addic-
tion differently. It isn’t a problem with 
the minorities. It is a problem with 
America that we have to cope with. 
And we need to deal with it honestly, 
not with stiff criminal penalties so 
much as treatment that can deal with 
these addictions, and that is critically 
important. 
The war on drugs took its toll on 
America. It directly fueled the crisis of 
mass incarceration, and we wasted— 
wasted—billions of Federal dollars in 
the process, dollars that could have 
been spent on actually making Amer-
ica safe. 
We need to replace criminalization 
with commonsense and compassion. We 
can start by passing the EQUAL Act. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on a separate topic, as 
we round out the week, we continue to 
vote on a number of very important ex-
ecutive and judicial nominations. 
I want to start by speaking quickly 
about four critical positions in the Jus-
tice Department: Matt Olsen, to head 
the DOJ National Security Division; 
Chris Schroeder, nominated to head 
the Office of Legal Counsel; Hampton 
Dellinger, Office of Legal Counsel; Eliz-
abeth Prelogar, to serve as the Na-
tion’s next Solicitor General. 
All of them are eminently qualified, 
have deep experience and strong cre-
dentials, and they understand the im-
portance of DOJ independence. Let me 
say a few words about them. 
Matt Olsen has dedicated the bulk of 
his career to helping keep our Nation 
safe, and he will continue do that same 
thing as Assistant Attorney General 
for National Security. From his time 
at the Justice Department to his work 
at the National Security Agency, to his 
tenure as the confirmed Director of the 
National Counterterrorism Center, he 
has been a leader when it comes to se-
curity in America. 
Chris Schroeder, nominated to head 
the Justice Department’s Office of 
Legal Counsel—or OLC—has significant 
experience, including serving as coun-
selor to the Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral and as Deputy Assistant himself. 
He has a deep understanding of the of-
fice and is ready to provide the kind of 
skill and experience we need. 
Hampton Dellinger, nominated to 
serve as Assistant AG for the Office of 
Legal Policy, has bipartisan support in 
our committee and has decades of pub-
lic and private service. He oversaw the 
judicial 
vetting 
process 
for 
State 
judges in North Carolina. I am con-
fident he will enable the Department of 
Justice to continue its track record of 
processing President Biden’s highly 
qualified nominees. 
Elizabeth Prelogar, nominated to be 
the U.S. Solicitor General, is an ac-
complished appellate advocate. She ar-
gued nine cases before the Supreme 
Court and filed hundreds of amicus 
briefs and other petitions. She knows 
this job, and she knows it well, and it 
is time that she is given this oppor-
tunity to serve. 
Let me conclude by saying that these 
nominees are the kind of experienced 
people we need. We have good nominees 
for the court as well. 
The Senate will also be voting soon 
on two highly qualified nominees for 
the Federal judiciary: Omar Williams 
for the District of Connecticut and 
Beth Robinson for the Second Circuit. 
These nominees have received strong 
support from their home State sen-
ators. They both currently serve as 
State court judges, and both have been 
rated ‘‘well qualified’’ by the American 
Bar Association. Their records show 
that they have an even-handed ap-
proach to administering justice and 
that they are guided by one principle 
above all else: fidelity to the rule of 
law. 
Judge Omar Williams, nominated to 
the District of Connecticut, is an ac-
complished 
State 
court 
judge 
and 
former public defender who has earned 
wide acclaim from the Connecticut 
legal community. 
In recognition of his work on the 
State bench, Judge Williams was ap-
pointed to several important judicial 
bodies by the Connecticut Supreme 
Court, including the New England Re-
gional Judicial Opioid Initiative. He 
also received bipartisan support in the 
Judiciary Committee. 
As I mentioned, we will also be vot-
ing on Vermont Supreme Court Justice 
Beth Robinson, nominated to the Sec-
ond Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice 
Robinson is an experienced litigator 
with a proven track record of impar-
tial, 
even-handed 
judicial 
decision- 
making. 
She attended Dartmouth College and 
the University of Chicago Law School. 
After graduating, she clerked for Judge 
David Sentelle—a President Reagan ap-
pointee—on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the D.C. Circuit. 
In private practice, Justice Robinson 
specialized in civil litigation. She also 
developed a large practice representing 
LGBTQ clients in civil rights and fam-
ily law issues. 
Justice Robinson was a proponent of 
LGBTQ rights at a time when most 
were not. She championed same-sex 
couples’ freedom to marry and partici-
pate in, as Justice Kennedy said in 
Obergefell, the ‘‘highest ideals of love, 
fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and fam-
ily.’’ 
As an advocate, she always under-
stood and respected the important 
intersection between LGBTQ rights 
and religious liberty. She worked with 
Vermont State representatives on a 
marriage equality bill to ‘‘affirm[] 
what the Constitution required-that no 
clergy would be forced to perform a 
same-sex marriage against their will.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7411 
October 27, 2021 
Since her appointment to the bench, 
Justice Robinson has proven that she 
respects the difference between being 
an advocate and a judge. Over the last 
10 years, she has participated in nearly 
1,800 decisions. And she has done so 
without a hint of bias. 
One of her former colleagues on the 
Vermont Supreme Court wrote to the 
committee to emphasize that Justice 
Robinson was a ‘‘fair, unbiased’’ jurist. 
So it certainly came as a surprise when 
some of our colleagues on the other 
side suggested that Justice Robinson 
opposes religious liberty. 
Let me be clear: This is a baseless 
claim. And it is a claim that was made 
by 
distorting 
Justice 
Robinson’s 
record. So let’s set the record straight. 
In private practice, she represented a 
Catholic woman who believed that she 
had been discriminated against because 
of her religious views. Remarkably, 
committee Republicans offered this as 
proof of Justice Robinson’s hostility 
toward religious liberty. 
In private practice, Justice Robinson 
was also instrumental in ensuring that 
a Vermont marriage equality bill in-
cluded protections desired by religious 
leaders, such as a provision specifying 
that clergy would never be ‘‘forced to 
perform a same-sex marriage against 
their will.’’ 
In 2003, she stated: ‘‘I’ve always said 
that if somebody tried to force the 
Catholic Church to do a gay wedding, I 
would represent the Church pro bono.’’ 
So these claims that she is biased 
have no basis in reality. 
Justice Robinson is an outstanding 
nominee with impeccable credentials. 
She has a proven even-handed approach 
to justice. And she would be the first 
openly LGBTQ woman to serve on a 
circuit court. 
I look forward to supporting both 
Judge Williams and Justice Robinson, 
and I urge my colleagues to join me. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
EQUAL ACT 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I first 
want to say before my colleague 
leaves—I know he has a packed day— 
when I came to the U.S. Senate, I 
found a friend, I found a mentor, and I 
found a leader on issues of justice. The 
incredible friend I have in the Senator 
from Illinois—he has been leading on 
issues from immigration reform and 
fighting for Dreamers all the way to 
being the principal leader on the 
Democratic side for the passage of the 
First Step Act. 
I will never forget that he invited me 
to the White House in my earliest days 
with then-President Obama, centering 
me on that table. I had just gotten 
here, and he then was talking about 
these issues—the issues of mass incar-
ceration, the issues of racial discrimi-
nation and incarceration. What I rise 
to talk about really is an issue that my 
colleague has been dealing with for 35 
years. He gave important history. 
It was a bipartisan issue 35 years ago 
when the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives voted to pass the Anti- 
Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and the Presi-
dent signed it into law that year. He 
said, very specifically, one of the 
things it did was create a massive sen-
tencing disparity between crack and 
powder cocaine. The bill made it so 
that five grams of crack cocaine—the 
example that my colleague gave—car-
ried the same mandatory minimum 
prison sentence as 500 grams of powder 
cocaine. That is a 100-to-1 disparity. 
What is very powerful to me is what 
Maya Angelou said. She said: 
Do the best you can until you know better. 
Then when you know better, do better. 
And that is the leadership of Senator 
DICK DURBIN. Understanding that this 
was a failure, that the policy did not 
achieve its intended purpose—in fact, 
it created, as he described, the oppo-
site—DICK DURBIN then led this body 
towards the long process of making re-
forms happen. 
I was proud that when I got into the 
Senate, Senator DURBIN told me the 
story of how we got it from 100 to 1 
down to 18 to 1. It wasn’t necessarily 
based on science. It wasn’t necessarily 
based on law enforcement evidence. It 
was a negotiation between Senator 
DURBIN
and another Republican col-
league. I love the story because Sen-
ator DURBIN pushed for what we are 
asking for right now. He then fought 
for 1 to 1. He couldn’t get it but was 
able to negotiate down from 100 to 1 to 
18 to 1. 
So what I would like to do is read 
real quickly the research that looked 
at cocaine use in the United States 
from right before this bill was first 
passed up until 2013. I want to quote: 
Despite harsher ADAA penalties for crack 
compared to powder cocaine, there was no 
decrease in crack use following implementa-
tion of sentencing policies . . . although 
both powder cocaine use and misuse of pre-
scription drugs (the negative control) de-
creased. 
The report concluded that ‘‘these 
findings suggest that mandatory min-
imum sentencing may not be an effec-
tive method of deterring cocaine use.’’ 
This has been the growing consensus 
about the War on Drugs on both sides 
of the aisle. It has been one that has 
been changing policy. 
I am so grateful for Senator DURBIN’s 
work chipping away at the mistakes 
that were made. 
During the time between when I was 
in law school in the 1990s and mayor of 
the largest city in my State in 2006, we 
saw the prison population explode in 
this country. In that period, we were 
building a new prison or jail—about 1 
every 10 days. We became the place on 
the planet Earth with the most incar-
cerated people. One-third of all the 
women incarcerated on planet Earth 
are now in the United States of Amer-
ica; one out of every four incarcerated 
people, period—in the United States of 
America. 
A growing consensus of bipartisan 
work led by Senator DURBIN with his 
wingman from Jersey has been begin-
ning to undermine that, with our part-
ners. So we saw the 2018 passage of the 
First Step Act, a bill which was made 
retroactive, and we saw thousands of 
people liberated from Federal prison 
who were unjustly sentenced under 
that 1986 law. The bill Senator DURBIN 
and I wrote and introduced, the EQUAL 
Act—this is again Senator DURBIN’s 
leadership—is now our opportunity to 
do better. 
It must feel good for everyone who 
understands the good intentions but 
disastrous results of the crack cocaine- 
powder cocaine disparity. For all those 
who understand that we say equal jus-
tice under law, but the dispropor-
tionate impact it had on Black and 
Brown communities, further punishing 
African-American communities in a 
disproportionate way—in fact, incar-
cerated Black men at rates that we 
now have more Black men under crimi-
nal supervision in America than all the 
slaves in 1850. So we are working to do 
better. 
The bill that I picked up to partner 
with Senator DURBIN
on passed the 
House of Representatives. And Senator 
DURBIN hinted at this—I would have 
never expected it—it passed with over-
whelming bipartisan support. The bill 
was championed by Democrats and Re-
publicans. It passed with 149 Repub-
licans voting for it, and now it is over 
here. The great thing is, our list of co-
sponsors, which Senator DURBIN read, 
is growing. I think we will have an an-
nouncement over the next few days of 
other Republicans joining this bill. 
We can’t change the past, but we can 
make for a better future. We can’t 
undo the disparities that have dis-
proportionately sent African Ameri-
cans to prison, but we can make for a 
more equal and more just future. 
There is an old saying that ‘‘the arc 
of the moral universe is long, but it 
bends towards justice.’’ It was a Martin 
Luther King quote. But he also said 
that ‘‘change does not roll in on the 
wheels of inevitability.’’ It must be 
carried in on the backs of people who 
are willing to struggle for it, people 
who still believe that this Nation can 
be a symbol to this world about justice 
and its justice system. 
A terrible mistake was made 35 years 
ago. I was a teenager. There are people 
right now unjustly incarcerated—an af-
front to our most sacred ideal in this 
country, that of liberty. They are there 
because of this mistake. We have not 
fixed it. It was grievous. We have not 
fixed it. It is wrong. This is our mo-
ment. It is a moment of redemption to 
right past wrongs, to set this Nation on 
a more just course, to bend the arc of 
the moral universe more towards jus-
tice. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. I urge them to be arc benders. To-
gether, we can make this a more per-
fect Union. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.

OVER-THE-COUNTER HEARING AIDS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
hear from Iowans all the time about 
the high cost of hearing aids. The $5,000 
or $6,000 or even $10,000 costs are often 
shocking for seniors who are on fixed 
incomes. 
Thirty-eight million Americans, and, 
obviously, most of the time adults, 
have hearing loss. Hearing loss makes 
it harder to work, harder to socialize, 
and then easier to become isolated. 
In 2016, I began a bipartisan effort 
with Democratic Senator WARREN of 
Massachusetts to allow consumers to 
purchase 
over-the-counter 
hearing 
aids. If you can buy nonprescription 
reading glasses over the counter, it 
makes very good sense that you should 
be able to buy basic, safe hearing aids 
as well. 
When Senator WARREN and I began 
our efforts, our goal was simple: By 
making more products more easily 
available to consumers, this competi-
tion will increase and then lead to 
lower costs. 
Despite every special interest, we 
passed in 2017 a bill that is entitled the 
‘‘Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act.’’ 
Last week, the FDA, just now, released 
proposed 
regulations 
for 
over-the- 
counter hearing aids. This is very wel-
comed news, but it took the FDA bu-
reaucracy more than 3 years to draft 
regulations. 
Senator WARREN and I pressed both 
the Trump administration and now the 
Biden administration to take action, 
get these regulations out so we can get 
these over-the-counter hearing aids on 
the market. I am glad that the FDA fi-
nally did its job. 
Now the same Iowans who told me 
about the high cost of hearing aids can 
comment on the draft regulations. So 
everybody who wants to make such 
comments has until January 18 of next 
year to make comments on the draft 
regulations. 
As long as the FDA bureaucracy 
acts—and I hope they will be listen-
ing—I expect Iowans can purchase 
over-the-counter hearing aids some-
time in early 2022. 
This is good news for Iowans and for 
Americans, generally. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
to discuss where things stand after 9 
months under President Biden. 
To start, American citizens are still 
left behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, 
even though the President said in Au-
gust that he would get every single 
American home safe before pulling out 
our troops. 
And the numbers are much worse 
than the administration has led us to 
believe. As of this week, the State De-
partment is in touch with more than 
400 Americans who are still in Afghani-
stan. About half of those—at least 196 
American citizens—want to leave, but 
they have been unable to do so. 
Leaving even one American citizen 
who wants to come home at the mercy 
of the Taliban is a failure in leader-
ship. It should never have been an op-
tion. But it has been 2 months, and 
there are still 196 Americans in Af-
ghanistan who want out. That is un-
conscionable. 
President Biden should have done 
what was needed to bring every last 
American home, like he promised he 
would do in August. That is his No. 1 
responsibility as President, to ensure 
the safety of the American people. 
But maybe we shouldn’t be surprised, 
since he hasn’t been able to secure our 
own border. In fact, he doesn’t even try 
to secure our southern border. 
Customs and Border Protection re-
ported recently that they apprehended 
more than 1.7 million migrants at-
tempting to cross our southern border 
illegally over the span of just 12 
months. That is the highest total ever 
recorded in a single fiscal year. And if 
border agents encountered 1.7 illegal 
migrants, imagine how many were able 
to cross into our country undetected. 
CBP encountered nearly 200,000 ille-
gal migrants last month alone, mean-
ing that apprehensions were up by 
more than 230 percent in September 
2021 compared to September of 2020. 
If you want to know why we have 
this crisis at the border, ask the mi-
grants themselves. Many have been 
very honest about why they risk their 
lives to travel thousands of miles to 
the United States. If you ask them 
why—ask them why they are here— 
their answer is simple: The President 
promised to let us in. 
We are a nation of immigrants, but 
we cannot have effective legal immi-
gration if illegal immigration is spi-
raling out of control. 
Illegal immigration means cutting in 
front of millions of people who have 
been waiting years to come to the 
United States the right way. Our mes-
sage as a nation needs to be that if you 
want to come here, you have to follow 
our laws. You cannot just walk across 
the border. 
President Obama said it well a few 
weeks ago in an interview on ABC 
News. He said: 
And we see tragedy and hardship and fami-
lies that are desperately trying to get here 
so that their kids are safe, and they’re in 
some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe. 
At the same time, we’re a nation state. We 
have borders. The idea that we can just have 
open borders is something that . . . as a 
practical matter, is unsustainable. 
Well, ABC cut that portion of the 
interview out. I suppose they can’t 
allow a former President of the United 
States to disagree with the radical left-
wing of their party. 
This is all taking place against the 
backdrop of the highest inflation rate 
in decades and massive supply chain 
issues that threaten to cripple our re-
covering economy. The White House in-
sists these problems are only going to 
affect the upper class—they are high- 
class problems. Press Secretary Jen 
Psaki said the other day that our sup-
ply chain issues are nothing more than 
‘‘the tragedy of the treadmill that’s de-
layed.’’ What an out-of-touch thing to 
say. She must be talking about her 
friends and neighbors here in DC be-
cause I don’t know many Nebraskans 
who are spending thousands of dollars 
on in-home treadmills. 
Rising costs and shortages are hurt-
ing everyone—most of all, the tens of 
millions of Americans who are living 
paycheck to paycheck. The President’s 
shameless ‘‘buy now, pay later’’ poli-
cies are forcing hard-working Ameri-
cans to pay an extra dollar for a gallon 
of gas while they watch the real value 
of their retirement accounts slump. 
They might not live in Washington 
or New York or San Francisco, but 
these are real people. They are small 
business owners who are wondering if 
they will be able to get the supplies 
that they need to meet historic de-
mand this holiday season. They are 
millions of hard-working Americans 
who rely on propane to heat their 
homes who are worried about getting 
priced out of a warm house this winter. 
They are families who don’t know if 
they will be able to put food on the 
table for their kids. 
Anyone who thinks most people’s 
first concern is whether the newest 
Peloton is going to arrive on time, 
they have no idea what working Ameri-
cans do to get by every single day. 
What has the response to these un-
precedented 
problems 
been 
in 
the 
media? The Washington Post said it is 
‘‘time for some new, more realistic ex-
pectations.’’ I think people will find 
that ‘‘lower your expectations’’ is not a 
very optimistic and it is not a very in-
spiring slogan for the party in power. 
And as dangerous as this wave of in-
flation is, it is really not like nobody 
saw it coming. Larry Summers, the lib-
eral economist who directed the Na-
tional Economic Council under Presi-
dent Obama, has been sounding the 
alarm for months. He is not the only 
one. Dozens of leading experts have 
warned against borrowing trillions of 
dollars to expand the reach of govern-
ment when inflation is already running 
rampant. 
But, earlier this year, Democrats in 
Congress spent nearly $2 trillion on an 
entirely partisan basis under the pre-
tense that it was necessary to fight the 
pandemic. So what is the fix? What is 
the fix? How is President Biden going 
to pull America back from the brink of 
stagflation? 
Well, he wants to spend even more of 
the 
American 
people’s 
hard-earned 
money. The President said in August 
that the massive, multitrillion-dollar 
spending spree he wants this Chamber 
to approve ‘‘won’t increase inflation. It 
will take the pressure off of inflation.’’ 
Well, he leaves how that might hap-
pen to our imagination. In reality, try-
ing to spend our way out of inflation is 
like trying to put a fire out with light-
er fluid; it is absolutely delusional.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7413 
October 27, 2021 
We cannot just keep spending more 
and more, not when, as the senior Sen-
ator from West Virginia said recently, 
‘‘[m]illions of jobs are open, supply 
chains are strained, and unavoidable 
inflation taxes are draining workers’ 
hard-earned wages as the price of gaso-
line and groceries continues to climb.’’ 
Out-of-control spending is how we 
got here in the first place, and the 
longer we keep at it, the worse it is 
going to get. Some Democrats are fond 
of saying that this bill will cost zero 
dollars because, well, it might be paid 
for through new taxes. The truth is 
that their plan would create trillions of 
dollars in new entitlements, and even if 
they do find a way to pay for it, which 
I doubt, that doesn’t mean it is free. 
That money has to come from some-
where, and the Joint Committee on 
Taxation has shown that two-thirds of 
Democrats’ proposed new tax burdens— 
they would fall on the lower and the 
middle class of this country. 
I wish I could say the outrageous 
pricetag is the only thing wrong with 
the Democrats’ tax-and-spend boon-
doggle, but what is actually in their 
plan might even be more irresponsible. 
It would allow the IRS to snoop on 
Americans’ bank accounts if their 
inflows 
and 
their 
outflows 
exceed 
$10,000 per year. 
Now, that is a lot of money, but let’s 
put it in perspective. Federal agents 
would get to see your house and car 
payments, how much you spend on gro-
ceries and gas, heating bills, school 
costs for your kids, and everything else 
that you spend in a year just to get by. 
So spending over $10,000 a year on these 
essentials that are in our lives, they 
would let the IRS be in just about 
every American’s bank account. 
Democrats’ plan would also expand 
green energy tax credits for wealthy 
Americans so they can buy expensive 
electric vehicles they can already af-
ford. A millionaire can buy the most 
expensive new Tesla for $150,000, and 
under what the senior Senator from Or-
egon has proposed, they will be able to 
claim a tax credit worth $12,500. Ne-
braska taxpayers don’t need to be sub-
sidizing new electric cars for rich 
Americans. 
And maybe worst of all, the House 
plan does not include the Hyde amend-
ment, which Republicans and Demo-
crats have agreed on for decades. If the 
radical left succeeds in taking that 
out, taxpayers will be required to pay 
for abortions for the first time in more 
than 40 years. 
The 
American 
people 
have 
been 
watching this country bounce from cri-
sis to crisis to crisis, and after so many 
disasters in a row, one poll shows that 
President Biden’s approval rating is 
down to just 37 percent. Barely a third 
of Americans approve of the job this 
President is doing, and a majority say 
this administration is not competent. 
That should tell President Biden that 
his agenda isn’t as popular in the rest 
of America as it is in the beltway bub-
ble. But, instead, the President is forg-
ing ahead with more Federal Govern-
ment controls. 
There is now even talk of a Federal 
vaccine mandate. The government is 
going to twist an obscure labor law be-
yond recognition to force Americans to 
take that vaccine. 
I believe in the vaccines. I believe 
they are safe and effective and we 
should be encouraging people to choose 
to get vaccinated, but the govern-
ment—the government—simply has no 
business requiring Americans to do it. 
Under the President’s new Executive 
order, businesses with more than 100 
employees are being forced to comply 
with the vaccine mandate or submit 
employees to weekly testing; other-
wise, they will risk losing crucial em-
ployees. 
I recently signed on to a letter led by 
the junior Senator from Alaska that 
urges the President to reconsider. 
There is absolutely no precedent in 
American history for a Federal vaccine 
requirement, and President Biden will 
be on entirely new legal ground if he 
moves ahead with this. 
One of the most unsettling things I 
have seen from this administration 
wasn’t something that they said or did; 
it was something that they left unsaid. 
When Jen Psaki broke the news that 
the Federal Government was going to 
try to force through this mandate, she 
smiled. In response to a reporter who 
asked if the President had the power to 
enforce vaccination for private employ-
ees—not Federal contractors, private 
employees—she 
said, 
‘‘Yes. 
Stay 
tuned.’’ And then she grinned. 
Without saying anything, she showed 
that the Biden administration is rel-
ishing this chance to push the limits of 
Executive power. When you take that 
together with the incompetence that 
has been on display since January, 
from the Afghanistan debacle to the 
crisis at our southern border, to our ad-
ministration’s complete disregard for 
how inflation is devastating hard- 
working families and the poor in our 
country, I think you start to get a good 
idea of what the Biden administration 
is all about. 
They are going to trample on the 
Constitution to advance a radical left 
agenda that is truly unprecedented in 
American history, and they don’t care 
how many disasters they continue to 
create. 
Thank you.

sent that the 5:15 vote occur imme-

TRIBUTE TO THE OAK RIDGE 85, 
THE CLINTON 12, AND REVEREND 
PAUL TURNER 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is my privilege to honor an esteemed 
group of Americans for their coura-
geous stand against the horrors of seg-
regation. 
It has been said that those about to 
make 
history 
can’t 
possibly 
com-
prehend the impact their actions will 
have on the world; but I think that in 
this case, the opposite was true. The 
heroes I honor today weren’t fighting 
to cross a threshold, but for something 
far more fundamental: the dignity and 
freedom granted by our Lord God to all 
men, women, and children. It was a 
moment of hope and profound con-
sequence that rippled across the coun-
try and embraced the potential of fu-
ture generations. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee 
congressional delegation, I would like 
to thank the following Tennesseans for 
their tremendous contribution to the 
fight against hatred: 
Jo Ann Crozier Allen Boyce, 
Bobby Cain, 
Anna Theresser Caswell, 
Ronald Gordon ‘‘Poochie’’ Hayden, 
Minnie Ann Dickie Jones, 
William R. Latham, 
Alvah Jay McSwain, 
Regina Turner Smith, 
Maurice Soles, 
Robert Thacker, 
Gail Ann Epps Upton, and 
Alfred Williams, who comprise the ‘‘Clin-
ton 12’’; 
Dr. Ahmed Alhamisi (Lawrence Graham), 
Rufus Graham, 
L.C. Gipson, 
Emma McCaskill, 
Ernestine Avery, 
Margaret Strickland Guinn, 
Eugene Hawkins, 
Mary Mahone Bohanon, 
Ethel Davidson Sykes, 
Monroe Jones, 
Leroy Justice, 
Maxine Officer, 
Alma McKinney Stevens, 
Archie Lee, 
Dorothy Kirk Lewis, 
Eloise Mitchell, 
Edward Lewis Threat, 
Charles Walker, 
Shirley Hawkins Lawrence, 
Barbara Jean Sims Thomas, 
Jessie McClanahan, 
Webster Jackson, 
John D. Ghosten, Jr., 
Evindies Copeland, 
Mattie L. Scales, and 
Joe West, Jr., 
who comprise the living membership of the 
‘‘Oak Ridge 85’’; 
and the late Reverend Paul Turner, whose 
bravery and defiance on December 4, 1956, ad-
vanced the cause of integration on behalf of 
countless generations of young Black Ameri-
cans. 
I pray the American people will hold 
close the example set by these freedom 
fighters. I thank them for their brav-
ery, their sacrifice, and above all their 
belief that love can overcome irre-
deemable evil, if only we have the 
courage to welcome it in.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JESSICA SAUM 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to outstanding ed-
ucator Jessica Saum, who was named 
2022 Arkansas Teacher of the Year. 
As a special education teacher at 
Stagecoach Elementary in Cabot, AR, 
Jessica has demonstrated her excel-
lence in the classroom time and time 
again by helping each student reach 
their full potential. 
She has provided unique opportuni-
ties for her students and engaged with 
the community to bring learning to life 
in her classroom. The creativity she 
brings to each lesson allows her stu-
dents to learn and grow in exciting and 
distinct ways. 
Just as impressive is the commit-
ment that Jessica exudes beyond the

classroom. She was recognized as the 
2020 314th Airlift Wing Key Spouse of 
the Year at the Little Rock Air Force 
Base for her volunteer work. Mrs. 
Saum is a remarkable military spouse, 
teacher, and advocate for children with 
special needs. 
Her passion for and commitment to 
education can be seen by Jessica’s own 
pursuit of learning. She obtained a 
bachelor of science in early childhood 
and special education, a master of 
science 
in 
special 
education 
edu-
cational specialist (4–12), and a grad-
uate certificate as a special education 
director from Arkansas State Univer-
sity. 
We are fortunate to have Jessica rep-
resenting the many great teachers in 
Arkansas, as well as serving as a role 
model to future generations of Natural 
State educators. 
I 
congratulate 
Jessica 
for 
this 
achievement and all of her contribu-
tions to her community and our State. 
Her determination, devotion, and com-
mitment to her students and the field 
of education, in addition to her support 
for our military members and their 
families, is exemplary. I am encour-
aged by her efforts to inspire our fu-
ture generations and her passion to 
help them to succeed.∑

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF KHOZ 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 75th anniversary 
of KHOZ. 
When KHOZ was established in 1946, 
its founders were dedicated to the task 
of bringing the people of Boone County 
a quality radio program for the whole 
family. That became a reality on Sep-
tember 28, 1946, when the station aired 
its first broadcast. 
These hard-working Arkansans con-
nected Boone County, as the county’s 
first radio station began sharing news, 
sports programming, and music with 
citizens in the region. 
Today, the staff at KHOZ continues 
this task, having successfully earned 
the admiration and trust of the Har-
rison community. This radio station 
has been a staple in the area, from pro-
viding jobs to keeping its listeners in-
formed and bringing good times and 
good music over the airwaves. KHOZ 
has remained a source of comfort and 
joy for so many Harrison residents, and 
I am confident it will continue to do so 
for many years. 
To recognize this milestone, the 
KHOZ team has thoughtfully put to-
gether a video documentary commemo-
rating its staff’s many years of dedica-
tion to bettering the station and the 
community. The documentary show-
cases the familiar hosts and the stories 
they have shared with family, friends 
and coworkers. It also highlights the 
rich history of the station and follows 
its growth over the years. I am honored 
to have been able to contribute to this 
celebration. 
KHOZ’s commitment to the commu-
nity and its listeners is a testament to 
this station’s values and dedication to 
the vision of its founders. By instilling 
a sense of familiarity over the years, 
listeners have connected with the sta-
tion and developed special relation-
ships with their favorite hosts. This 
public service has become a cherished 
piece of the region’s history and daily 
life. 
Congratulations to KHOZ on its 75th 
anniversary 
and 
for 
the 
countless 
memories it has created for its lis-
teners. I look forward to its continued 
success for years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO JIM HART 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the honor of recognizing Madison 
County commissioner Jim Hart for his 
15 years of service to the citizens of 
Madison County, MT. 
Jim was sworn in on January 1, 2007, 
and never looked back. He tackled a 
variety of tough issues impacting a 
large county in southwest Montana. 
From the Barney Bridge to the Ennis- 
Big Sky Airport, local infrastructure 
was critically important to Jim and his 
constituents. 
Fellow Madison Commissioners Dan 
Allhands and Ron Nye shared a quip 
that Commissioner Hart often told 
them and fellow Madisonians after 
local projects were completed. They 
said, ‘‘You done good.’’ And I agree. 
Jim’s calm demeanor was an effective 
tool in his toolbox that allowed him to 
be especially effective serving his con-
stituents and rise in stature across our 
great State. 
Commissioner Hart became only the 
second commissioner in the history of 
Madison County to be elected president 
of Montana Association of Counties, 
otherwise known as MACo. Commis-
sioner Jason Strouf from Custer Coun-
ty and MACo’s current president said, 
‘‘Commissioner Hart is a truly honor-
able and kind leader who has been 
steadfast in his service to Madison 
County as well as all counties in Mon-
tana. Our members, through Jim’s ten-
ure as MACo President, quickly be-
came 
familiar 
with—and 
learned 
from—his quiet yet resolute governing 
skills. It has been an honor and a privi-
lege to know Commissioner Hart.’’ 
I am grateful for Jim’s dedication 
and passion to serving Montana. He has 
surely left Madison County with large 
shoes to fill.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DANIEL HUTCHINSON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Daniel Hutchinson of Roosevelt County 
as Montanan of the Month for his acts 
of heroism and leadership following the 
tragic Amtrak derailment that oc-
curred in Joplin, MT, last month. 
Daniel and his son Joshua were two 
of the 141 passengers on board the Em-
pire Builder train headed to Seattle on 
September 25, 2021. That afternoon, 
tragedy struck. The train derailed in 
rural Montana between Joplin and 
Chester. After the crash, Daniel didn’t 
hesitate to jump into action and help 
fellow passengers aboard the train. 
His years of military training pre-
pared him to act swiftly and selflessly 
to identify injured passengers and help 
others off the train. Daniel imme-
diately took control of the situation, 
making his way through the train and 
calling out to locate trapped or injured 
passengers. 
After the accident, Daniel stated 
that he said a prayer thanking the 
Lord for putting him in the right place 
at the right time. He did everything he 
could to get others out of harm’s way, 
and I believe the passengers Daniel 
helped are also saying a prayer of 
thanks for his heroic actions. 
His kindness and leadership extend 
far beyond that fateful day. Daniel’s 
son, Joshua, describes him as a good 
neighbor, an avid outdoorsman, and an 
advocate for veterans. Joshua says his 
dad is a true Montanan in every sense 
of the word, and I couldn’t agree more. 
It is my honor to recognize Daniel for 
his quick and decisive actions on the 
day of that horrific accident and for his 
everyday acts of service that make 
Montana a better place.∑

RECOGNIZING THE HANOVER HIGH 
SCHOOL WILDCATS 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the achievements of 
Hanover High School in Washington 
County, KS. I want to offer my con-
gratulations to the students, staff, and 
coaches 
of 
the 
Wildcats 
football, 
volleyball, boys basketball, and boys 
track team for winning the Kansas 1A 
DII High School State Championships 
during the 2020–2021 academic school 
year. 
After the challenges of the pandemic, 
the ability of these student athletes to 
succeed in the classroom and on the 
field is admirable. Continuing edu-
cation and supporting student athletes 
is a top priority in Kansas, and these 
students exemplify how resilient our 
children are and the importance of 
being a part of a team. Achievements 
such as these do not happen overnight; 
they take the support of families, 
friends, 
teachers, 
coaches, 
faculty, 
staff, and volunteers. It takes a com-
munity, and Hanover should be proud. 
The Hanover Wildcats started the 
year coming out strong when the 
volleyball team won the State title for 
the first time since 1979 in straight sets 
against Attica High. The eight-man 
football 
team 
championship 
game 
against St. Francis, leading 46–24, 
ended a perfect 11–0 season. The boys 
basketball team went on to win Han-
over’s 
seventh 
State 
championship 
with a 24–1 record, while the boys’ 
track team rounded out the year com-
ing back against the odds to clinch the 
first place spot in the final relay at the 
State track meet, leaving with a lead 
of eight points. 
These young men and women have 
set an example for all of us, dem-
onstrating that success in life comes to

those who are willing to set goals and 
work hard to achieve them. Not only 
did they perform with exceptional 
mental and physical fortitude, but they 
also displayed remarkable sportsman-
ship while prioritizing work in the 
classroom and studying hard. This im-
pressive display of prudence after a 
challenging school year demonstrates 
the grit of Hanover students in the face 
of difficulties. 
I once again extend my congratula-
tions to these student athletes, as well 
as Principal Matthew Mattos, Athletic 
Director Scott Hutchison, and trainer 
Paige Radomski. 
I wish each of these young men and 
women continued success in the class-

Whereas the United States is kept strong

tions and actions;

NIZE 
THE 
SIGNIFICANT 
EDU-
CATIONAL 
IMPLICATIONS 
OF 
DYSLEXIA THAT MUST BE AD-
DRESSED, AND DESIGNATING OC-
TOBER 2021 AS ‘‘NATIONAL DYS-
LEXIA AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Ms. WAR-
REN, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. 
GRAHAM, Mr. KING, Mr. BOOZMAN, and 
Mr. WARNOCK) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 430 
Whereas dyslexia is— 
(1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in 
reading for an individual who has the intel-
ligence to be a much better reader; and 
(2) most commonly caused by a difficulty 
in phonological processing (the appreciation 
of the individual sounds of spoken language), 
which affects the ability of an individual to 
speak, read, spell, and, often, the ability to 
learn a second language; 
Whereas the First Step Act of 2018 (Public 
Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194 et seq.) included a 
definition of dyslexia as part of the require-
ment of the Act to screen inmates for dys-
lexia upon intake in Federal prisons; 
Whereas the definition of dyslexia in sec-
tion 3635 of title 18, United States Code, as 
added by section 101(a) of the First Step Act 
of 2018, is the first and only definition of dys-
lexia in a Federal statute; 
Whereas dyslexia is the most common 
learning disability and affects 80 to 90 per-
cent of all individuals with a learning dis-
ability; 
Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly 
prevalent, affecting as many as 1 out of 
every 5 individuals; 
Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an 
individual with dyslexia may have both— 
(1) weaknesses in decoding that result in 
difficulties with accurate or fluent word rec-
ognition; and 
(2) strengths in higher-level cognitive func-
tions, such as reasoning, critical thinking, 
concept formation, and problem solving; 
Whereas great progress has been made in 
understanding dyslexia on a scientific level, 
including the epidemiology and cognitive 
and neurobiological bases of dyslexia; 
Whereas the achievement gap between typ-
ical readers and dyslexic readers occurs as 
early as first grade; and 
Whereas early screening for, and early di-
agnosis of, dyslexia are critical for ensuring 
that individuals with dyslexia receive fo-
cused, 
evidence-based 
intervention 
that 
leads to fluent reading, the promotion of 
self-awareness and self-empowerment, and

SA 3926. Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. CARDIN, and Mr. 
YOUNG) submitted an amendment in-
tended to be proposed by him to the 
bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2022 for military 
activities of the Department of De-
fense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Encouraging Normalization of 
Relations With Israel 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Israel 
Relations Normalization Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Support for peace between Israel and its 
neighbors has longstanding bipartisan sup-
port in Congress. 
(2) For decades, Congress has promoted 
Israel’s acceptance among Arab and other 
relevant countries and regions by passing 
numerous laws opposing efforts to boycott, 
isolate, 
and 
stigmatize 
America’s 
ally, 
Israel. 
(3) The recent peace and normalization 
agreements between Israel and several Arab 
states—the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, 
Sudan, and Morocco—have the potential to 
fundamentally transform the security, diplo-
matic, and economic environment in the 
Middle East and North Africa and advance 
vital United States national security inter-
ests. 
(4) These historic agreements could help 
advance peace between and among Israel, the 
Arab states, and other relevant countries 
and regions, further diplomatic openings, 
and enhance efforts towards a negotiated so-
lution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict re-
sulting in two states—a democratic Jewish 
state of Israel and a viable, democratic Pal-
estinian state—living side by side in peace, 
security, and mutual recognition. 
(5) These agreements build upon the dec-
ades-long leadership of the United States 
Government in helping Israel broker peace 
treaties with Egypt and Jordan and pro-
moting peace talks between Israel and Syria, 
Lebanon, and the Palestinians. 
(6) These agreements also build on decades 
of private diplomatic and security engage-
ment between Israel and countries in the re-
gion. 
(7) These normalization and peace agree-
ments could begin to transform the region 
by spurring economic growth, investment, 
and tourism, enhancing technological inno-
vation, promoting security cooperation, bol-
stering water security and sustainable devel-
opment, advancing understanding, and forg-
ing closer people-to-people relations. 
SEC. 1293. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COM-
MITTEES DEFINED. 
In this subtitle, the term ‘‘appropriate con-
gressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 1294. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to expand and strengthen the Abraham 
Accords to encourage other nations to nor-
malize relations with Israel and ensure that 
existing agreements reap tangible security 
and economic benefits for the citizens of 
those countries; 
(2) to develop and implement a regional 
strategy to encourage economic cooperation

the Palestinians to enhance the prospects for 
peace, respect for human rights, transparent 
governance, and for cooperation to address 
water scarcity, climate solutions, health 
care, sustainable development, and other 
areas that result in benefits for residents of 
those countries and regions; 
(3) to develop and implement a regional se-
curity strategy that recognizes the shared 
threat posed by Iran and violent extremist 
organizations, 
ensures 
sufficient 
United 
States deterrence in the region, builds part-
ner capacity to address shared threats, and 
explores multilateral security arrangements 
built around like-minded partners; 
(4) to support and encourage government- 
to-government and grassroots initiatives 
aimed at normalizing ties with the state of 
Israel and promoting people-to-people con-
tact between Israelis, Arabs, and residents of 
other relevant countries and regions, includ-
ing by expanding and enhancing the Abra-
ham Accords; 
(5) to support a negotiated solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two 
states living side by side in peace, security, 
and mutual recognition; 
(6) to implement the Nita M. Lowey Middle 
East Partnership for Peace Act (title VIII of 
division K of Public Law 116–260), which will 
support 
economic 
development 
and 
peacebuilding efforts among Israelis and Pal-
estinians, in a manner which encourages re-
gional allies to become international donors 
to these efforts; 
(7) to oppose efforts to delegitimize the 
state of Israel and legal barriers to normal-
ization with Israel; and 
(8) to work to combat anti-Semitism and 
support normalization with Israel, including 
by countering anti-Semitic narratives on so-
cial media and state media and pressing for 
curricula reform in education.

UNITED 
STATES 
STRATEGY 
TO 
STRENGTHEN 
AND 
EXPAND 
THE 
ABRAHAM ACCORDS AND OTHER RE-
LATED 
NORMALIZATION 
AGREE-
MENTS WITH ISRAEL. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and annually thereafter, the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development and the heads of other 
appropriate Federal departments and agen-
cies, shall develop and submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a strategy 
on expanding and strengthening the Abra-
ham Accords. 
(b) 
ELEMENTS.—The 
strategy 
required 
under subsection (a) shall include the fol-
lowing elements: 
(1) An assessment of future staffing and 
resourcing requirements of entities within 
the Department of State, the United States 
Agency for International Development, and 
other appropriate Federal departments and 
agencies with responsibility to coordinate 
United 
States 
efforts 
to 
expand 
and 
strengthen the Abraham Accords. 
(2) An assessment of opportunities to fur-
ther promote bilateral and multilateral co-
operation between Israel, Arab states, and 
other relevant countries and in the eco-
nomic, social, cultural, scientific, technical, 
educational, and health fields and an assess-
ment of roadblocks to increased cooperation. 
(3) An assessment of bilateral and multi-
lateral security cooperation between Israel, 
the United States, Arab states, and other rel-
evant countries and regions that have nor-
malized relations with Israel, including an 
assessment of potential roadblocks to in-
creased 
security 
cooperation, 
interoper-
ability, and information sharing. 
(4) An assessment of the likelihood of addi-
tional Arab and other relevant countries and 
regions to normalize relations with Israel. 
(5) An assessment of opportunities created 
by normalization agreements with Israel to 
advance prospects for peace between Israelis 
and Palestinians. 
(6) A detailed description of how the 
United States Government will leverage dip-
lomatic lines of effort and resources from 
other stakeholders (including from foreign 
governments, international donors, and mul-
tilateral institutions) to encourage normal-
ization, economic development, and people- 
to-people programming. 
(7) Identification of existing investment 
funds that support Israel-Arab state coopera-
tion and recommendations for how such 
funds could be used to support normalization 
and increase prosperity for all relevant 
stakeholders. 
(8) A proposal for how the United States 
Government and others can utilize the schol-
ars and Arabic language resources of the 
United States Holocaust Museum to counter 
Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism. 
(9) 
An 
assessment 
for 
creating 
an 
Abrahamic Center for Pluralism to prepare 
educational materials, convene international 
seminars, promote tolerance and pluralism, 
and bring together scholars as a means of ad-
vancing religious tolerance and countering 
political and religious extremism. 
(10) Recommendations to improve Depart-
ment of State cooperation and coordination, 
particularly between the Special Envoy to 
Monitor Anti-Semitism and the Ambassador 
at Large for International Religious Free-
dom, and the Office of International Reli-
gious Freedom, to combat racism, xeno-
phobia, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism, 
which hinder improvement of relations be-
tween Israel, Arab states, and other relevant 
countries and regions. 
(11) An assessment on the value and feasi-
bility of Federal support for inter-parliamen-
tary exchange programs for Members of Con-
gress, Knesset, and parliamentarians from 
Arab and other relevant countries and re-
gions, including through existing Federal 
programs that support such exchanges. 
(c) FORM.—The report required under sub-
section (a) shall be in unclassified form but 
may contain a classified annex. 
SEC. 1296. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO NOR-
MALIZATION WITH ISRAEL. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Strengthening Reporting of Ac-
tions Taken Against the Normalization of 
Relations with Israel Act of 2021’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Arab League, an organization com-
prising 22 Middle Eastern and African coun-
tries and entities, has maintained an official 
boycott of Israeli companies and Israeli- 
made goods since the founding of Israel in 
1948. 
(2) Longstanding United States policy has 
encouraged Arab League states to normalize 
their relations with Israel and has long 
prioritized funding cooperative programs 
that promote normalization between Arab 
League States and Israel, including the Mid-
dle East Regional Cooperation program, 
which promotes Arab-Israeli scientific co-
operation. 
(3) While some Arab League governments 
are signaling enhanced cooperation with the 
state of Israel on the government-to-govern-
ment level, most continue to persecute their 
own citizens who establish people-to-people 
relations with Israelis in nongovernmental 
fora, through a combination of judicial and 
extrajudicial retribution. 
(4) Some Arab League states maintain dra-
conian anti-normalization laws that punish 
their citizens for people-to-people relations 
with Israelis, with punishments, including 
imprisonment, revocation of citizenship, and 
execution. 
Extrajudicial 
punishments 
by 
these and other Arab states include sum-
mary imprisonment, accusations of ‘‘trea-
son’’ in government-controlled media, and 
professional blacklisting. 
(5) Anti-normalization laws, together with 
the other forms of retribution, effectively 
condemn these societies to mutual estrange-
ment and, by extension, reduce the possi-
bility of conciliation and compromise. 
(6) Former Israeli President Shimon Peres 
said in 2008 at the United Nations that Israel 
agrees with the Arab Peace Initiative that a 
military solution to the conflict ‘‘will not 
achieve peace or provide security for the par-
ties’’. 
(7) Despite the risk of retaliatory action, a 
rising tide of Arab civic actors advocate di-
rect engagement with Israeli citizens and 
residents. These include the Arab Council for 
Regional Integration, a group of 32 public 
figures from 15 Arab countries who oppose 
the boycott of Israel on the grounds that the 
boycott has denied Arabs the benefits of 
partnership with Israelis, has blocked Arabs 
from helping to bridge the Israeli-Pales-
tinian divide, and inspired divisive intra- 
Arab boycotts among diverse sects and eth-
nic groups. 
(8) On February 11, 2020, a delegation of the 
Arab Council to the French National Assem-
bly in Paris testified to the harmful effects 
of ‘‘anti-normalization laws’’, called on the 
Assembly to enact a law instructing the rel-
evant French authorities to issue an annual 
report on instances of Arab government ret-
ribution for any of their citizens or residents 
who call for peace with Israel or engage in 
direct civil relations with Israeli citizens, 
and requested democratic legislatures to 
help defend the region’s civil peacemakers. 
(9) On May 11, 2020, 85 leaders in France 
published an endorsement of the Arab Coun-
cil’s proposal, calling on France and other 
democratic governments to ‘‘protect Arabs 
who engage in dialogue with Israeli citizens’’ 
and proposing ‘‘the creation of a study group 
in the National Assembly as well as in the 
Senate whose mission would be to ensure a 
legal and technical monitoring of the obsta-
cles which Arab proponents of dialogue with 
Israelis face’’. 
(10) Arab-Israeli cooperation provides sig-
nificant symbiotic benefit to the security 
and economic prosperity of the region. 
(c) ADDITIONAL REPORTING.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and annually thereafter for 5 years, the Sec-
retary of State shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a report on 
the status of efforts to promote normaliza-
tion of relations with Israel and other coun-
tries. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required under 
paragraph (1) shall include the following in-
formation: 
(A) The status of ‘‘anti-normalization 
laws’’ in countries comprising the Arab 
League, including efforts within each coun-
try to sharpen existing laws, enact new or 
additional ‘‘anti-normalization legislation’’, 
or repeal such laws. 
(B) Instances of the use of state-owned or 
state-operated media outlets to promote 
anti-Semitic propaganda, the prosecution of 
citizens or residents of Arab countries for 
calling for peace with Israel, visiting the 
state of Israel, or engaging Israeli citizens in 
any way. 
(C) Instances of extrajudicial retribution 
by Arab governments or government-con-
trolled institutions against citizens or resi-
dents of Arab countries for any of the same 
actions referred to in subparagraph (B). 
SEC. 1297. SUNSET. 
This subtitle shall cease to be effective on 
the date that is 5 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.

SEC. 1064. APPOINTMENT OF ULYSSES S. GRANT 
TO GRADE OF GENERAL OF THE AR-
MIES OF THE UNITED STATES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On March 3, 1799, Congress created the 
grade of ‘‘General of the Armies of the 
United States’’ as the commander of the 
Army of the United States (5th Congress, 
Session III, Chap. 48, Section 9). 
(2) On March 16, 1802, Congress effectively 
dissolved the grade of General of the Armies 
of the United States when it passed the Mili-
tary Peace Establishment Act without ref-
erence to the grade (7th Congress, Session I, 
Chap. 9, Sec. 3). 
(3) On July 1, 1843, Ulysses S. Grant grad-

SEC. 1236. SENSE OF SENATE ON CONTINUING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
ESTONIA, 
LATVIA, 
AND LITHUANIA. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the security of the Baltic region is cru-
cial to the security of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization alliance, and the United 
States should continue to prioritize support 
for efforts by the Baltic states of Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania to build and invest in 
critical security areas, as such efforts are 
important to achieving United States na-
tional security objectives, including deter-
ring Russian aggression and bolstering the 
security of North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion allies; 
(2) robust support to accomplish United 
States strategic objectives, including by pro-
viding assistance to the Baltic countries 
through security cooperation referred to as 
the Baltic Security Initiative pursuant to 
sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States 
Code, should be prioritized in the years to 
come; 
(3) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania play a 
crucial role in strategic efforts— 
(A) to deter the Russian Federation; and 
(B) to maintain the collective security of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alli-
ance; 
(4) the United States should continue to 
pursue efforts consistent with the com-
prehensive, multilateral assessment of the 
military requirements of Estonia, Latvia, 
and Lithuania provided to Congress in De-
cember 2020; 
(5) the Baltic security cooperation road-
map has proven to be a successful model to 
enhance intraregional Baltic planning and 
cooperation, particularly with respect to 
longer-term regional capability projects, in-
cluding— 
(A) integrated air defense; 
(B) maritime domain awareness; 
(C) command, control, communications, 
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and re-
connaissance; and 
(D) Special Operations Forces develop-
ment; 
(6) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are to 
be commended for their efforts to pursue 
joint procurement of select defense capabili-
ties and should explore additional areas for 
joint collaboration; and 
(7) the Department of Defense should— 
(A) continue robust, comprehensive invest-
ment in Baltic security efforts consistent 
with the assessment described in paragraph 
(4); 
(B) continue efforts to enhance interoper-
ability among Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania and in support of North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization efforts; 
(C) encourage infrastructure and other 
host-country support improvements that 
will enhance United States and allied mili-
tary mobility across the region; 
(D) invest in efforts to improve resilience 
to hybrid threats and cyber defenses in Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania; and 
(E) support planning and budgeting efforts 
of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that are 
regionally synchronized.

ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Family 
Violence Prevention and Services Improve-
ment Act. The Illinois Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence and its members have clearly 
communicated to me the critical nature of the 
Family Violence Prevention and Services fund-
ing and the improvements included in this leg-
islation to Chicago and the state of Illinois. 
In 2020, these funds helped provide over 
547,287 hours of service in Illinois, assisting 
42,886 adult survivors of domestic violence 
and 8,055 child witnesses. These dollars pro-
vided shelter, transportation and parental sup-
port, legal advocacy and education, crisis 
intervention, and connections to community re-
sources. For example, Ascend Justice use 
these federal funds to support their vital work 
to obtain Orders of Protection for their clients. 
Similarly, Metropolitan Family Services used 
these funds to provide direct emergency sup-
port to their clients to help survivors of domes-
tic violence to find or maintain safer housing, 
feed and clothe their families, protect them-
selves from COVID–19, and access lifesaving 
services remotely during the pandemic. Spe-
cifically, here are just a few ways Metropolitan 
Family Services used these funds: 
Provided rent and utility payment assistance 
of between $500 to $1000 for 32 clients; 
Paid for five hotel shelter nights for a client 
who was unable to access other emergency 
shelter when she needed it; 
Provided grocery gift cards of between $50 
to $250 per client for 18 clients experiencing 
food insecurity; 
Provided clothing, toiletries, and/or PPE kits 
to 50 clients; 
Purchased and distributed educational ma-
terials about COVID–19 to clients and commu-
nity members; 
Purchased eight Chromebooks to loan to cli-
ents to participate in remote domestic violence 
counseling services to overcome their lack of 
adequate technology; and 
Purchased four laptops for the Domestic Vi-
olence Court advocates, allowing them to con-
tinue assisting clients with Orders of Protec-
tion, legal referrals, and courtroom support 
while the Centralized Domestic Violence 
Courthouse in Chicago was operating re-
motely. 
These funds and services mean the dif-
ference between safety and harm, and I ap-
plaud this House for improving the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services program. I urge 
my colleagues to vote in favor of this legisla-
tion.

CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to associate myself with 
the remarks of all of my colleagues on the Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol, and par-
ticularly those of the Select Committee’s Vice 
Chair, LIZ CHENEY of Wyoming. 
Their contributions to this debate have un-
derscored our legislative purpose, the cen-
trality of Steve Bannon’s role in our investiga-
tion, and the importance of compliance with a 
duly issued congressional subpoena to the 
rule of law. I am proud to lead them in this in-
vestigation authorized by the House in H. Res.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
MAJOR DENNIS ALLEN 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career and recognize the retirement 
of a true American hero, Major Dennis Allen. 
Major Allen has served his community and 
Nation admirably for 55 years, including three 
years in the military and 52 years as a law en-
forcement officer. 
Born on August 13, 1947, to parents Jo and 
Bill Allen, Dennis spent his childhood in 
Silsbee, Texas. Following his graduation from 
Silsbee High School in 1966, he joined the 
Army and served a year-long tour of duty in 
Vietnam from January 1967 to January 1968. 
In Vietnam, he spent his time as a light weap-
ons member of a 10-man reconnaissance 
team in the Central Highlands area of North 
Pleiku. 
After being honorably discharged in 1969, 
he 
attended 
Georgetown 
University 
and 
trained at the Metropolitan Police Academy in 
Washington, D.C. He later served as a patrol-
man, undercover detective, and member of 
the Civil Disturbance Unit for the Washington 
D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 
As an MPD officer, he was one of many called 
to respond to the mass demonstrations in D.C. 
on ‘‘May Day’’ in 1969, which resulted in the 
arrests of more than 6,000 rioters and pro-
testers of the Vietnam War. 
In 1973, Dennis returned to his hometown in 
Texas and began working for the Silsbee Po-
lice Department, eventually serving in every 
position within the agency, including Chief of 
Police. He later moved on to work for two 
other law enforcement entities located in 
Southeast Texas, including the Polk County 
Sheriff’s Office, where he was the Captain of 
Detectives for ten years, and the Hardin Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office, where he held the positions 
of Deputy Sheriff, Sergeant, and Major of 
Criminal Investigations during his stay. In addi-
tion to his law enforcement education, Dennis 
holds a Master Peace Officer License through 
the state of Texas and has held that level of 
certification since 1994. 
To say that Dennis has had a remarkable 
career is a vast understatement as few law 
enforcement officers reach 50 years of serv-
ice. The positive impact he has made is evi-
dent by the number of officers he has 
mentored and trained, many of whom have 
become supervisors and administrators them-
selves. Their accomplishments are a direct re-
flection of the leadership and instruction they 
received from Major Allen. 
Yet, life was not only about law enforcement 
for Dennis, especially after marrying his beau-
tiful bride Sandy in 1973. Dennis and Sandy 
have two children, Kevin Allen and Stacy 
Caldwell, and are also the proud grandparents 
of six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Major 
Dennis Allen for his more than half a century 
of unwavering commitment to his community 
and country. He has done so with incredible 
integrity and professionalism, and I am hon-
ored to represent such a patriot in Congress.

RECOGNIZING JOE EDMONSON AND 
FAMILY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and celebrate Mr. Joe 
Edmonson who has been named Mississippi’s 
Farmer of the Year by the Sunbelt Agriculture 
expo. I am proud to have him representing our 
state. 
Joe has been a motivated and passionate 
farmer for his entire life. At the age of fifteen, 
he purchased his first forty acres of land. Both 
Joe and his wife Melissa grew up in farming 
families and have dedicated their lives to 
Topshaw farms. Melissa is a full partner in the 
farms and is an essential figure in the 
Vardaman 
Sweet 
Potato 
Festival. 
Their 
daughter, Brandi also works in the business 
side of the farm. Her husband, Shaun man-
ages the packing warehouse line. Son Trent 
oversees planting and harvesting, and his wife 
is a nurse who aids in minor medical incidents 
around the farm. Son Cody manages sweet 
potato planting and grain harvesting and his 
wife Lindsey works in the packing warehouse 
offices and manages H2A work. 
The farm has endured multiple natural dis-
asters that affected their crop and livestock. 
The Edmonson family has taken these hard-
ships as opportunities to expand and built an 
impressive packing facility. They have taken

into stride changes in agriculture technology 
and continue to evolve with the modem world. 
Joe and his family contribute to their sur-
rounding community through the Boy Scouts, 
Vardaman FFA, Calhoun County 4–H and the 
state Farm Bureau. 
Family is at the core of Mr. Edmonson’s 
farming career. Joe, Melissa, Brandi, Trent 
and Cody have been a pillar of the Vardaman 
community and have made incredible contribu-
tions to Calhoun County. I am grateful for their 
lifetime of service and commend him for his 
outstanding work in agriculture.

RECOGNIZING COMPASSUS 
HOSPICE IN SPRINGFIELD, MO 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Compassus Hospice in Springfield, 
MO for their innovative work in providing hos-
pice care. 
Founded in 1979, Compassus Hospice in 
Springfield 
is 
the 
oldest 
facility 
in 
the 
Compassus system and has provided critical 
care for Southwest Missourians. Hospice pro-
viders deliver end-of-life services for seriously 
ill patients, including bereavement support for 
their families and community. Compassus 
Hospice has always been at the forefront of 
hospice care, leading the industry in innova-
tion for end-of-life care. 
Compassus Hospice has also worked to im-
prove care by working with lawmakers to ad-
vance coordinated care with community part-
ners. Their dedication to providing this critical 
care is truly commendable. November is Na-
tional Hospice and Palliative Care Month, and 
Compassus in Springfield will celebrate its 
more than 40 years of patient care on Novem-
ber 18. 
Madam Speaker, for 42 years, Compassus 
Hospice in Springfield has been at the leading 
edge of providing end-of-life healthcare along 
with bereavement service for families. I con-
gratulate them on 42 years of service and 
wish them all the best in the many years to 
come.

CONGRATULATING 
JEFFREY 
VENHUIZEN 
FOR 
HIS 
RETIRE-
MENT FROM THE ROCK ISLAND 
POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Chief Jeffrey R. VenHuizen, 
who is retiring from the Rock Island Police De-
partment after nearly 29 years of service. His 
last day with the Department will be October 
31, 2021. 
Chief VenHuizen first joined the Rock Island 
Police Department on February 1, 1993, after 
earning a degree in Law Enforcement Admin-
istration from Western Illinois University. From 
K–9 
Officer 
to 
Patrol 
Lieutenant, 
Chief 
VenHuizen has held every position imaginable 
at the Department. His peers rewarded him for 
his hard work and steadfast dedication to pro-
tecting our community when he was named 
Chief of Police on December 10, 2012. Under 
his tutelage, the Department made out-
standing strides forward. He helped enact the 
first body camera system in an agency of its 
kind in the Quad Cities region, implement 
community-oriented policing strategies, and re-
duce crime to unprecedented levels. Chief 
VenHuizen, along with his selflessness and 
dedication to the city of Rock Island, will be 
dearly missed. 
It is because of courageous and venerable 
leaders such as Chief VenHuizen that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to, again, formally recognize Chief Jeffrey 
R. VenHuizen on his retirement and thank him 
for his almost 29 years of service to our com-
munity.

HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a renown and trailblazing entrepreneur 
from Philadelphia, Benjamin Bynum, Sr., a 
savvy businessman, and former United States 
Marine who died on Tuesday, October 19, 
2021 at the age of 93. 
Benjamin Louis Bynum, Sr. was born in 
Lexington, South Carolina on April 6, 1923. He 
was one of five brothers and five sisters. Dur-
ing World War II, he was a member of the 
Montford Point Marines, making him among 
the first African Americans to join the U.S. Ma-
rines Corps. 
Mr. Bynum was also a long-time business-
man that operated some of the most popular; 
restaurants, jazz, and blues venues in the city 
of Philadelphia. Venues including—the Cad-

lin, Nina Simone, Kenny Gamble, Count 
Basie, George Benson, Fats Domino, Woody 
Herman, Bill Paul, and the Stylistics. As a 
matter of fact, Bill Paul’s first album was called 
‘‘Feeling Good at the Cadillac Club,’’ paying 
homage to the venue. 
His venues were known for providing an 
upscale environment and terrific cuisine. 
A cultural hub that was often frequented by 
black professionals and famous people. Which 
gave it a national reputation and following. 
Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, 
who worked as a disc jockey under the name 
‘‘Mixmaster Mike’’, at a Bynum establishment, 
credits Mr. Bynum in influencing him into get-
ting in politics. Nutter said he got lessons in 
diplomacy, hospitality, and government while 
working there. He proclaimed, ‘‘I would never 
have been in public service if not for Ben 
Bynum.’’ 
Additionally, Mr. Bynum raised his sons to 
be business savvy and great restauranteurs. 
They are successful entrepreneurs in their 
own right. He was super proud of his children 
and their careers, declaring ‘‘This is the seed 
that I planted.’’ Mr. Bynum was a hard worker 
that often stressed that he would never retire. 
He worked well into his 90’s. He could often 
be detected working the door at his sons’ res-
taurants. 
As evidenced by his extraordinary life and 
career, Benjamin Bynum, Sr. served his nation 
in the military and was a trailblazing entre-
preneur. He was a model citizen and proud 
Philadelphian. The 3rd Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania extends gratitude to Mr. 
Bynum for his dedicated support and service 
to the people and the city of Philadelphia. I 
offer sincere condolences to his family; to his 
brother, Jimmy, his sons Robert and Benjamin 
Jr., his daughters Antoinette, Benita, and 
Denee, nine grandchildren, seven great-grand-
children, and one great-great-grandchild, his 
partner, Thelma and friends on his passing.

RECOGNIZING JOES, CO, VOLUN-
TEER 
FIREFIGHTER 
LARRY 
WYANT 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Joes, Colorado, volunteer firefighter 
Larry Wyant. On Tuesday, October 26, 2021, 
Mr. Wyant was headed to the funeral of an-
other area firefighter, Mr. Darcy Stallings, 
when a fire began in a cornfield in southern 
Yuma County. Mr. Wyant was responding to 
the call when high winds changed the direc-
tion of the grasslands fire, claiming his life. 
The small town of Joes is a close-knit com-
munity, and Mr. Wyant an integral part of it. 
Every volunteer stopped what they were doing 
to help contain the grasslands fire that day, 
according to Joes Fire Department. Mr. 
Wyant’s commitment to his friends and com-
munity will be remembered. His bravery and 
heroic actions serve as a reminder of the 
great sacrifice our first responders make. 
Madam Speaker, I am humbled and hon-
ored to recognize Mr. Wyant’s service and 
sacrifice. I want to extend my deepest condo-
lences to Mr. Wyant’s family, friends, fellow 
firefighters, and community.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF NANCY 
MITCHELL 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to pay tribute to the memory of my dear 
friend, Nancy Mitchell of Corbin, Kentucky, 
who earned her heavenly reward on October 
24, 2021 after an extended battle with cancer. 
Nancy and I first became acquainted when 
her husband, Bob Mitchell, helped lead my 
first congressional campaign in 1980. I asked 
Bob to serve as my District Director in 1981, 
and for 40 years, even after Bob retired, 
Nancy was a tried-and-true member of Team 
Rogers, quickly earning the friendship of 
countless folks across southern and eastern 
Kentucky with her welcoming smile and de-
lightful personality. When it was time to hit the 
road for Town Hall meetings across my ex-
pansive rural, mountainous district, Nancy put 
her life and her business on hold to join us for 
many long days and nights traveling from 
county to county, learning how we could help

improve Kentucky’s Appalachian region. It was 
truly a family affair. 
After Bob and Nancy’s daughters, Stephanie 
and Jenny, were born she focused her time on 
raising two incredible girls. Bob and I spent 
many days, covering a lot of miles across 
Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional District every 
week, and Nancy never failed to provide un-
wavering support and encouragement along 
the way. 
Nancy was the epitome of a leading lady 
with tremendous class. She built Mitchell Tax 
and Accounting from the ground up, starting 
with an office in their home so she could work 
while raising their two girls. She grew her 
business from a small tax service into one of 
the leading accounting firms in southern Ken-
tucky, and she did so by treating her clients 
like true friends and beloved neighbors. In ad-
dition to running her own business, Nancy 
went on to be the first woman ever elected to 
the Corbin City Commission, simultaneously 
serving two terms as Vice Mayor of Corbin. 
She generously shared her expertise and 
savvy business style as a Trustee for Union 
College, a member of the Kentucky Board of 
Tax Appeals, and the KCEOC Community Ac-
tion Partnership’s Board of Directors. Nancy 
was also a dedicated Sunday School teacher, 
and she had a God-given gift of making every 
child feel special. In every aspect of her life, 
she was gracious with her time, humble in her 
conversations, and full of joy. 
While expanding her business, Nancy never 
lost her passion for politics and public service. 
She served as Vice President of the Kentucky 
Federation of Republican Women, Vice Chair 
of the Republican Party of Knox County, and 
Treasurer of Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional 
District Lincoln Club. In 2012, Bob and Nancy 
were jointly inducted into the Fifth Congres-
sional District Lincoln Club Hall of Fame. 
Above every achievement and success of 
her own, there was nothing that she took more 
pride in than her family, and especially her 
grandchildren: 
Tori, 
Taelor, 
Trenton 
and 
Ethan—who are all brilliant. Nancy beamed 
with pride when she shared stories about their 
latest accolades, and she was truly their big-
gest fan. 
My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest 
heartfelt sympathies to my closest friend, Bob 
and the entire Mitchell family. Everyone who 
knew and loved Nancy now has a special 
treasure waiting for them in heaven. She was 
bold in her faith in God and that gives us 
peace to carry on.

HONORING THE CAREER OF LINDA 
ANDREWS 
HON. PETE STAUBER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, today, I 
am proud to honor the career of Linda An-
drews, a Minnesota broadcasting legend who 
is retiring after 35 years in the radio industry. 
Linda began her radio career as a part-time 
announcer on KWNG in Red Wing and will be 
concluding it in Brainerd as an experienced 
broadcaster admired by her colleagues and 
countless listeners across the region. 
Linda moved to Brainerd, Minnesota in 
1995, where she was a News Director and an-
nouncer for KLIZ–FM The Power Loon, 
KKLK–FM and more. In 2000, she became the 
midday announcer on WJJY–FM in Brainerd. 
During her tenure at the beloved station, they 
were awarded multiple Crystal Awards and 
one Service to America Award. 
Over the past 26 years that Linda has spent 
broadcasting in Brainerd, she captivated the 
local audience and quickly became a fan-fa-
vorite in the community. She will be dearly 
missed by all of her listeners. 
Linda’s contributions to Brainerd, Minnesota 
and beyond will never be forgotten. I along 
with the rest of Minnesota’s Eighth Congres-
sional District wish her nothing but the best in 
her well-deserved retirement.

HONORING CAPTAIN LORI TURPIN 
HON. JAMES R. BAIRD 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor a dedicated public servant and distin-
guished member of our community, Captain 
Lori Turpin. 
In 1971, Lori was sworn into the Navy 
Nurse Corps Scholarship program. For the fol-
lowing 30 years, she traveled the world pro-
viding medical care for members of our mili-
tary. 
Throughout her time in the Navy, she cared 
for service men and women throughout the 
United States and across the world in coun-
tries like Italy and Japan. 
Following her retirement from the United 
States Navy in 2001, Captain Turpin’s commit-
ment and sense of duty was repurposed, as 
she continued to compassionately serve her 
community and American veterans. 
Since 2007, Lori served as a Hendricks 
County Veterans Service Officer where she 
has truly embraced the mission to help vet-
erans achieve a better life and support their 
community. 
Lori’s service led her to receive numerous 
awards and recognitions including numerous 
commendation medals from the United States 
Navy and the Sagamore of the Wabash, one 
of Indiana’s highest honors. 
I want to congratulate Captain Turpin on a 
great career of dedicated service to the United 
States and wish her the very best in her retire-
ment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SENIOR 
INSPECTOR 
JARED 
KEYWORTH, 
USMS 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an American hero and a dedicated 
husband and father. Jared Keyworth, from 
Mandeville, LA, served as a Senior Inspector 
with the United States Marshals Service and 
tragically lost his life in the line of duty earlier 
this month. 
Senior Inspector Keyworth began his serv-
ice with the Marshals in July of 2010. Upon 
graduation from the United States Marshals 
Academy, Senior Inspector Keyworth was first 
assigned to the District of Colorado-Denver 
and later served in the District of Southern 
Florida-Miami and District of Eastern Lou-
isiana-New Orleans. In 2018, he was selected 
to serve the USMS Investigative Operations 
Division, Technical Operations Group in Baton 
Rouge, LA. 
Prior to Senior Inspector Keyworth’s service 
with the United States Marshals Service, he 
served his nation in the United States Army 
‘‘Old Guard’’, the Caisson Platoon, HHC 1st 
Battalion, 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment. While in 
the Army, Jared Keyworth escorted the rider-
less horse, the symbol of a fallen leader who 
will never ride again, during President Ronald 
Reagan’s funeral. 
On September 28, 2021, Senior Inspector 
Keyworth was critically wounded while in pur-
suit of a violent felony offender in the state of 
Mississippi. He passed away on October 1, 
2021. 
Jared will forever be in our hearts and 
minds, and Jennifer and I will keep his family 
in our prayers. We are eternally grateful for his 
service to our great country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WALTER GANN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Corporal Walter Gann, an American hero from 
Mississippi, who defended liberty against im-
possible odds in the Pacific during World War 
II. 
Walter, born in Calhoun City on January 31, 
1922, joined the U.S. Army on July 3, 1941. 
By July 15, he was aboard the USS Coolidge 
deployed to the Philippines as a member of 
the Army Signal Corps assigned to 409th Sig-
nal Company (Aviation) at Nichols Field out-
side Manila. The plan was to erect radar tow-
ers, but none of the equipment needed arrived 
on the ship with them. 
Imperial Japan attacked the Philippines on 
December 8 and all the critical airfields were 
destroyed by December 10. Walter’s company 
and the airmen were soon sent on combat

duty in the Bataan Peninsula. He was as-
signed to U.S. Army Forces Far East 
(USAFFE) headquarters at Little Baguio near 
the tip of Bataan. 
The troops on Bataan, running out of am-
munition, food, and medicine, with no hope of 
resupply or reinforcement, were surrendered 
by their commanding officers on April 9, 1942. 
Walter was among 86,000 American and Fili-
pino prisoners of war who were forced on 
what became known as the infamous Bataan 
Death March, one of World War II’s worst war 
crimes. In the tropical sun, deprived of food, 
water, and mercy, the men trekked 65 miles 
up Bataan to a train station. There they were 
packed standing 100 to a boxcar for the next 
24 miles. Men died where they stood. Sur-
vivors marched another eight miles to their 
first POW camp, O’Donnell. 
Walter, POW No. 203, was shipped to 
Japan in July 1943 packed in the dark, fetid 
hold of the hell ship Clyde Maru with 500 
other POWs. He was sent to be a slave la-
borer at Fukuoka No. 17 POW Camp attached 
to the Mitsui-owned Miike coal mine in south-
ern Japan close to Nagasaki. Starved, beaten, 
and denied medical care, he was forced to dig 
coal in a primitive mine until the camp was lib-
erated in September 1945. The coal mine is 
now a UNESCO Industrial World Heritage site, 
albeit without mention of the thousands of 
POWs held there or that the mine had re-
mained reliant on manual labor and not 
modem machinery. 
Although asked to testify in Japan at the 
war crime trials held from 1946 to 1948, Mr. 
Gann could not return because he remained 
too sick from the various illnesses he suffered 
from during his three and one-half years as a 
POW. For the remainder of his life, Walter 
bore the weight of all the horror and inhu-
manity he had witnessed. When he was able 
to work, Walter was a truck driver. 
In 1949, Walter moved to Booneville, Mis-
sissippi, and married Juanita Goddard. To-
gether they raised four children. In 1963, he 
lost both his wife and his stepson. In his later 
years, he lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
until he passed away on October 14, 1980. 
During his lifetime, Walter was awarded the 
Good Conduct Medal, the Purple Heart, the 
World War II Victory Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific 
Campaign Medal with one bronze campaign 
star, the American Defense Service Medal 
with one bronze campaign star, and the Phil-
ippine Defense Medal. He also received a let-
ter from President Harry S. Truman thanking 
him for his service. Posthumously, he received 
the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achieve-
ment, the Prisoner of War Medal, and the 
Presidential Unit Citation with two Bronze Oak 
Leaf Clusters. 
I am grateful for Corporal Walter Gann’s 
commitment to faith, family, and democracy. I 
am humbled by his sacrifices for our country.

CONGRATULATING 
JEFF 
RANKIN 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
DISTIN-
GUISHED 
SERVICE 
AWARD 
BY 
MONMOUTH COLLEGE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Jeff Rankin, who is this year’s re-
cipient of the Distinguished Service Award by 
Monmouth College. 
Mr. Rankin has always been drawn to Mon-
mouth College, as his father played football for 
Monmouth. Further, his twin brother attended 
the institution and is now its Director of The-
ater. A strong affinity for Monmouth College is 
a part of the fabric of his family, which is why 
Mr. Rankin has truly been dedicated to shar-
ing the story of Monmouth with the world for 
nearly his entire life. From 1992 until 2015, 
Mr. Rankin was Director of Communications 
for the College, where he served as an am-
bassador and one of its strongest advocates. 
He now assists the institution in a new posi-
tion as the College’s historian. Mr. Rankin’s 
contributions to advancing the rapid progress 
of Monmouth College have been significant 
and invaluable. 
It is because of passionate and leaders 
such as Jeff Rankin that I am especially proud 
to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to, again, for-
mally congratulate Jeff Rankin on receiving 
the Distinguished Service Award and thank 
him for his service to the Monmouth commu-
nity.

IN HONOR OF ROBERT E. JULIANO 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, Robert E. Juliano passed from this 
earth on October 18, 2021, at age 80. His 
passing is a great loss to our country and to 
the Union members he represented so loyally 
for so many years. It is a particular loss to the 
United States Congress, because he believed 
so passionately in our institution. It is no less 
a loss to so many of us in Congress who 
treasured Bob Juliano both professionally and 
personally. 
Bob was born May 20, 1941, to Emil and 
Mary Salvaria Juliano in his beloved home-
town of Chicago. Bob was a true product of 
Taylor Street and the West Side of Chicago, 
and he never lost his roots there. 
As a young man Bob Juliano became a per-
sonnel manager at the Palmer House Hilton 
Hotel in downtown Chicago. There he met the 
late Edward T. Hanley, then the leader in Chi-
cago of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union (HERE), the Union now 
known as UNITE HERE, which represents the 
workers at the iconic Palmer House. 
One of President Hanley’s first acts when 
he became International President of HERE in 
1973 was to hire Bob Juliano as the Union’s 
first full-time Legislative Representative. It was 
unorthodox to hire a management person to 
represent the Union’s members, and equally 
unorthodox to send to Washington someone 
with no lobbying experience at all. 
President Hanley’s unorthodox appointment 
was a response to Bob Juliana’s passionate 
belief, founded in his Catholic faith and Jesuit 
education, in bringing people together. Over 
the years, he put that belief into practice by 
bringing together management and labor as 
well as people of all colors and faiths. 
In Congress, Bob brought together Repub-
licans and Democrats, liberals and conserv-
atives, Members from smaller states and big 
cities. His faith in all of us is so sorely missed 
today. He had no interest in labels like con-
servative, moderate, or progressive. His inter-
est was always in finding the best in each of 
us and giving each of us the opportunity to do 
something good for everyday Americans. 
Bob had literally countless friends in Con-
gress. They included, among many others, 
Senators as diverse as Senator Robert J. 
Dole, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator 
Orrin Hatch, Senator Samuel Brownback, and 
Senators of both parties from his home state 
of Illinois, such as Everett Dirksen and RICH-
ARD J. DURBIN. He lived long enough to relish 
the ascension of his friend Joe Biden to the 
Presidency of the United States. 
In the House of Representatives, he like-
wise had strong relationships with Members 
across the spectrum, such as former Rep-
resentatives Chris Cannon and Frank LoBi-
ondo and his long-time close friend, House 
Appropriations Chair ROSA DELAURO, among 
many others. He regarded the late Speaker 
Tip O’Neill as an important mentor. 
Bob was particularly close to leaders of the 
Black Caucus, including the late Rep. John 
Lewis. He regarded the struggle for equality 
as the single most important issue of his life-
time. His belief in equality led him to work ac-
tively for civil rights and immigration reform, 
issues so important to the hospitality industry 
and to our nation. 
One key to Bob’s success on Capitol Hill 
was his many relationships with the staff who 
serve us as Members. Bob knew most of our 
Chiefs of Staff. He cared about everyone, 
whether the shoe-shine person, the Capitol 
Police Officer, the receptionist in our offices, 
the staff in the Doorkeepers’ offices, the custo-
dian, the food service worker—he knew and 
genuinely cared about them all. They re-
sponded to Bob because they sensed that his 
interest in them was genuine, and not simply 
a means to an end. Because of that sincere 
interest in everyone, Bob had a network any-
one else would envy. 
Bob Juliano was a product of the hospitality 
industry, and never was there a person more 
hospitable. He knew wine and food better than 
almost anyone, and he relished hosting so 
many people from so many walks of life. 
Bob never left behind his roots in Chicago 
and his roots in the hospitality industry. Rank 
and file hotel and restaurant workers in Chi-
cago and nationwide knew him. Representing 
their best interests was his lodestone. 
He was a vigorous representative of UNITE 
HERE and its members. At the same time, he 
represented important employers such as 
American Express and NASCAR. Bob never 
saw that as a conflict, because he was so 
adept at finding common ground. The succes-
sive Presidents of the Union that he served 
never saw it as a conflict either, because he 
was so good at bringing people together. One 
important example was his long service on the 
US Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, where 
he advocated for workers and for the industry 
as a whole. 
The late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chi-
cago called Bob Juliano his lobbyist. Bob was 
very proud to have served as a pall bearer for 
Cardinal Bernardin and for Speaker O’Neill. 
Among his many honors, he was especially 
proud to have been an Honoree of the Sons 
of Italy Foundation. 
Robert E. Juliano is survived by his son, 
Robert E. Juliano, Jr., of Chicago. He was

RECOGNIZING YUMA, CO, VOLUN-
TEER 
FIREFIGHTER 
DARCY 
STALLINGS 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, October 27, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life of volunteer firefighter Mr. 
Darcy Stallings. On October 21, 2021, Mr. 
Stallings passed away in an automobile acci-
dent while responding in his private vehicle to 
a call for a grasslands fire. His heroic actions 
and bravery stand as a reminder of the great 
sacrifice made by those who volunteer to 
serve their community as first responders. 
Mr. Stallings was a highly respected fire-
fighter who volunteered for the City of Yuma’s 
Volunteer Fire Department for nine years. 
Growing up in Yuma and serving on the board 
of the Yuma County Fairgrounds, he was an 
integral part of the community. Good people 
like Mr. Stallings represent the best of Amer-
ica. He was deeply committed to his family 
and community, and he will be remembered 
for his willingness to help others. On October 
21, Colorado lost a dedicated community serv-
ant, friend, and father. 
I want to extend my deepest condolences to 
Mr. Stallings’ family, friends, fellow firefighters, 
and community. Madam Speaker, I am hum-
bled and honored to recognize Mr. Stallings’ 
service and sacrifice.

HONORING RICHARD TRUMKA 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I am deeply 
saddened to hear about the loss of Richard 
Trumka. For those who knew him, Richard 
personified the integrity and selflessness he 
carried with him each day, sharing with all that 
he met. I was privileged to share a friendship 
with Richard, and when I first came to know 
him, I was immediately inspired by his pas-
sionate and courageous spirit. 
I don’t think there was a major election in 
Ohio over the past number of years where 
Richard was not in Niles or Youngstown or 
Akron campaigning and energizing union 
members. I was always impressed about how 
down to earth he was and how he had the 
common touch. But he was smart, he under-
stood labor law, he knew the politics of the 
issues affecting workers and knew what the 
average worker was facing and the chal-
lenges, Most importantly, he understood the 
process of what needed to happen to make 
things better. 
Richard was a hero of the labor movement 
and a champion for American Workers. He 
fought tirelessly to advocate for social and 
economic justice. As head of the AFL–CIO, he 
launched initiatives aimed at reaching younger 
workers, backed the ‘‘Fight for $15’’ effort to 
raise the minimum wage and called for em-
ployees to have a voice in ensuring their work-
places have proper safety protocols. 
Richard served on the boards of the Na-
tional Labor College, The AFL–COP’s Soli-
darity Center, The Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights, among others. He 
also sat on the boards of the Economic Policy 
Institute and the Housing Investment Trust 
and served as President Emeritus of the 
United Mine Workers. He spent his life work-
ing tirelessly as an inspiring advocate for the 
Catholic social justice principle of honoring the 
dignity of the worker. 
Richard’s work has motivated me to con-
tinue advocating on behalf of workers and en-
suring them a safe and secure future by pro-
tecting their ability to organize and collectively 
bargain. I am forever grateful that I was able 
to work alongside Richard and witness the im-
pact he had on the American people. His ad-
vocacy will live on to empower others to follow 
in his footsteps in pushing for positive social 
change.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 
1977, calls for establishment of a sys-
tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
tees, and committees of conference. 
This title requires all such committees 
to notify the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest—designated by the Rules Com-
mittee—of the time, place and purpose 
of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along
