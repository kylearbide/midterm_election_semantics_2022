PRAYER 
Reverend William Gurnee, St. Jo-
seph’s Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Heavenly Father, in the midst of this 
health crisis, we are humbled and re-
minded that we do not control nature 
but must respect it and work with it. 
You hold in Your hands the depths of 
the Earth and the highest mountains 
as well. You made the sea, and it be-
longs to You, the dry land, too, for it 
was formed by Your hands. As we rec-
ognize our dependence on Your provi-
dence, grant us health and safety. 
Finally, Dear Lord, give the Members 
of this body the virtue of courage in 
difficult times, the virtue of charity in 
all times, and at the end of the day, the 
certain knowledge that they have 
served their country well. 
Amen.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CENTER 
FOR 
THE 
ADVANCE-
MENT OF AVIATION ACT OF 2020 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I join my colleagues, Rep. DON YOUNG 
of Alaska, Chairman Emeritus of the Transpor-
tation Committee, and Rep. RICK
LARSEN, 
Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, in in-
troducing the bipartisan National Center for 
the Advancement of Aviation Act of 2020. Our 
committee has worked for years to make 
American skies the safest in the world, and to 
strengthen the industry workforce to maintain 
the highest standards of aviation excellence. 
Our legislation, the National Center for the 
Advancement of Aviation (NCAA) would sup-
port and promote collaboration amongst civil, 
commercial, and military aviation sectors to 
address the demands and challenges associ-
ated with ensuring a safe and vibrant national 
aviation system through research, education, 
and training. 
Too often in the past, innovation and les-
sons learned in various aviation sectors has 
not been shared in a collaboratively or timely 
manner, especially considering rapid develop-
ments in new technology. Our bill helps break 
down silos across commercial aviation, gen-
eral aviation and military aviation sectors that 
will not only improve safety and best practices, 
but also expand opportunities for those inter-
ested in the aviation workforce—for the young 
and not so young, from those just starting out, 
to those with experience who want to move 
into other types of aviation work. 
The National Center would focus on four 
key areas with an emphasis on aviation work-
force development. First, it would support edu-
cation efforts and provide resources to cur-
riculum developers so educators at all levels 
have the tools and training to educate the next 
generation of aviation professionals. 
Second, the national center would provide a 
forum 
to 
leverage 
and 
share 
expertise 
amongst industry sectors including the dis-
semination of existing high school education 
curriculum to develop and deploy a workforce 
of pilots, aerospace engineers, unmanned air-
craft system operators, aviation maintenance 
technicians, or other aviation maintenance 
professionals needed in the coming decades. 
Third, it would serve as a central repository 
for economic and safety data research and 
analysis allowing a comprehensive perspective 
of industry information that would improve 
safety for all stakeholders. 
Finally, it would support symposiums and 
conferences to facilitate collaboration across 
the industry and develop future advancements 
for the aviation and aerospace community. 
This legislation would also allow the FAA to 
focus on safety, certification, and air traffic op-
erations. 
The national center would be funded by 
using a small percentage of the interest ac-
crued annually on the taxes and fees collected 
from users of our aviation system and depos-
ited into the aviation trust fund. In other words, 
no general fund taxpayer dollars would be 
used to support this national center. 
Our aviation and aerospace industry sup-
ports over 11 million jobs and contributes 
more than $1.6 trillion per year to the national 
economy. More than 130 organizations includ-
ing schools, airports, airlines, manufacturers, 
unions, and other entities involved in aviation 
and aerospace have expressed strong support 
for this legislation. The list of organizations

IN HONOR OF RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, the loss of 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a loss for our 
country, but the grief is particularly acute for 
women and girls. We’ve lost the greatest femi-
nist icon of our time who used her legal tal-
ents to lift us up and fought for a world that 
recognized our equal stature and dignity. 
Her fame sort of crept up on her. Her tiny 
frame belied her judicial might. She had a soft

voice but was a megaphone in her words. She 
was a rock of righteousness and boasted rock 
solid abs from her planks and exercise regi-
men. She also became a fashionista icon as 
she donned collar necklaces and black lace 
gloves. 
As women members of Congress, our paths 
would have been even tougher had it not been 
for Justice Ginsburg’s brilliant legal strategy 
that built a foundation for our equality in the 
law. She turned the personal sex discrimina-
tion she endured into a life’s mission to over-
come. 
Imagine being told by the dean of the law 
school at Harvard that she was taking a man’s 
seat! After serving on both Harvard and Co-
lumbia’s law reviews and graduating first in 
her class, she couldn’t get a clerkship or an 
associate job at a New York law firm. She 
went on to teach as a professor of law at Rut-
gers and discrimination struck again—she 
found out she was making less than a male 
colleague of equal standing. When she com-
plained, she was told that he had a wife and 
two kids and she had a husband in a big law 
firm in New York City. 
She was going to file an EEOC complaint 
until the law school relented. She argued 300 
gender discrimination cases in her career later 
practicing law. She challenged bogus laws 
that claimed to protect women but in fact dis-
criminated against them, stating, ‘‘The ped-
estal upon which women have been placed 
has all too often, upon closer inspection, been 
revealed as a cage.’’ In her work on the bench 
she declared women should not be discrimi-
nated against, denied control of our bodies, 
and deserved equal pay for equal work. 
The fact that we cannot honor this titan 
properly because Republicans refuse to honor 
her dying wish adds further insult to our col-
lective injury. Their desire to destroy the ACA 
and rip away health care from 135 million 
Americans with preexisting conditions is great-
er than their sense of decency. Their thirst to 
pack the court with four Justices selected by 
Presidents who lost the popular vote is any-
thing but just. 
Her fervent wish, our fervent wish may be 
denied but no one can deny the notorious 
RBG her due, her greatness, her iconic pres-
ence in the Supreme Court hall of fame. 
Someday, her fervent wish of nine women 
Justices will be a reality. 
And so, we rise up. We fight for RBG’s leg-
acy and the just world she envisioned. It’s 
time for us all to be notorious.

SUPPORTING H.R. 8472 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of swift passage of H.R. 
8472, the Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief Act, 
my legislation with Representative DUSTY 
JOHNSON to ensure school districts with high 
numbers of military-connected children are not 
further 
financially 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus’s devastation. This bipartisan, bi-
cameral bill would allow school districts to use 
their last student headcount on upcoming ap-
plications for federal Impact Aid rather than 
conduct a student audit during this highly un-
usual and disruptive school year, and would 
eliminate the risk losing funding due to an 
undercount. 
Impact Aid supports school districts that en-
compass large amounts of federal land such 
as military installations and tribal land, and en-
sures they have the resources they need that 
would otherwise come from local taxes. With 
this school year’s unprecedented complexities, 
our bill would relieve these districts’ already 
overburdened administrators and staff of one 
labor intensive requirement, and ensure that 
they receive the full amount of Impact Aid pay-
ments they need to support our military and 
tribal students. 
In my district in Eastern Connecticut, the 
Ledyard and Groton school districts rely on 
Impact Aid as a key funding source. As 
schools are under immense pressure to keep 
kids learning in new formats this year, these 
funds are more crucial than ever, and this bill 
would ensure that schools can count on them. 
I thank my counterparts in the Senate for 
their work to build on the original proposal by 
including the Migrant Education Program as 
well, which requires a similar student count. 
This addition ensures that children of migrant 
agricultural workers receive the full public edu-
cation they are entitled to. 
Many thanks as well to Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT of the Education and Labor Committee 
for his support of this legislation. I urge the 
Senate to pass this bill without delay.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to make 
clear my position on H. Res. 1154 which con-
demns the QAnon movement and the dis-
turbing conspiracy theories which it promotes. 
Regrettably, my vote on this important resolu-
tion was inadvertently not recorded. But let me 
be clear, I strongly support this resolution and 
I condemn the dangerous conspiracies that 
this organization traffics in and continues to 
spread across the internet every day. The 
QAnon conspiracy movement is a danger to 
our national security and I am glad to see that 
this body condemned the organization in a 
strong, bipartisan fashion. I join with my col-
leagues in supporting this resolution.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 30, 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am including 
in the RECORD under General Leave for the 
consideration of H.R. 6270, a letter from Glob-
al Witness and the Sentry, relating to argu-
ments made by the Chamber of Congress and 
other opponents during consideration of that 
legislation. Their letter states, in part, quote 
‘‘As part of the current debate surrounding 
H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act of 2020, which uses a similar ap-
proach to the legislative effort our organiza-
tions have worked on and supported in Sec-
tion 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Re-
form and Consumer Protection Act, we have 
seen the same misinformation and dated anal-
ysis used to attack this bill as has been used 
to attempt to discredit efforts to address con-
flict minerals in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC).’’ End quote. 
The letter includes a number of examples 
that show the positive impact Section 1502 
has had in the DRC. The letter states, for ex-
ample, quote, ‘‘In 2010, the year Section 1502 
was passed, the U.N. Group of Experts stated 
that ‘in the Kivu provinces, almost every min-
ing deposit [was] controlled by a military 
group.’ By 2015, just four years after the con-
flict minerals rule was implemented by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the International Peace Information Service 
(IPIS) found that over three-quarters (79 per-
cent) of 3T miners surveyed in eastern Congo 
were working in mines where no armed group 
involvement had been reported . . . By the 
end of 2018, 465 tin, tantalum and tungsten 
and 106 gold mines have been validated 
green, which means that no signs of inter-
ference of armed groups or the Congolese 
army and no child labor have been found. 
These mines employ over 27,000 miners.’’ 
End quote. 
I realize that the notion of objective truth 
has taken a hit over the past few years, and 
that it may not hold as much sway in some 
circles. But I’m here to soundly reject the 
Chamber’s denigration of a successful law that 
it has long opposed in an effort to persuade 
members to oppose a similar bill, H.R. 6270, 
which is before us. I urge members to reject 
this kind of cynicism and give their strong sup-
port to H.R. 6270. 
SEPTEMBER 29, 2020. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The Sentry and Global 
Witness support efforts to combat corruption 
and human rights abuses connected to sup-
ply chains. We believe that due diligence and 
transparency measures can be effective in 
shifting behavior and supporting supply 
chains that are less abusive. 
As part of the current debate surrounding 
H.R. 6270, the ‘‘Uyghur Forced Labor Disclo-
sure Act of 2020, which uses a similar ap-
proach to the legislative effort our organiza-
tions have worked on and supported in Sec-
tion 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Re-
form and Consumer Protection Act, we have 
seen the same misinformation and dated 
analysis used to attack this bill as has been 
used to attempt to discredit efforts to ad-
dress conflict minerals in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC). The implementa-
tion of the 1502 Rule has not been without its 
challenges and it took time to set-up appro-
priate mechanisms in DRC but significant 
progress and an important foundation has 
been built. 
In 2010, the year Section 1502 was passed, 
the U.N. Group of Experts stated that ‘‘in 
the Kivu provinces, almost every mining de-
posit [was] controlled by a military group.’’ 
By 2015, just four years after the conflict 
minerals rule was implemented by the U.S.

(IPIS) found that over three-quarters (79 per-
cent) of 3T miners surveyed in eastern Congo 
were working in mines where no armed 
group involvement had been reported. Since 
then, overall armed interference in 3T and 
gold mining sites visited by IPIS has de-
creased from 41% in 2015 to 26% in the period

2016–2018. By the end of 2018, 465 tin, tan-
talum and tungsten and 106 gold mines have 
been validated green, which means that no 
signs of interference of armed groups or the

323 total) for the four conflict minerals have 
passed independent, third-party audits by 
the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process. 
This contrasts to an operating environment 
before the passage of Section 1502 when no 
certification mechanism existed for distin-
guishing mines conflict controlled by armed 
groups or the Congolese army from conflict- 
free mines. 
That is why Congolese civil society groups 
have been outspoken in their support. In 
2017, over 100 Congolese civil society organi-
zations signed letters in support of Section 
1502. Recently, Isaac Wikirevolo Mumbere, 
Human Rights officer at the Network for the 
Conservation and the Rehabilitation of For-
est Ecosystems, commented: ‘‘Dodd-Frank 
[1502] is a law worth its weight in gold be-
cause it has helped pull Congolese army 
commanders and militias out of the mines. 
Likewise, it has prevented Congolese offi-
cials who had taken the artisanal mining 
sector as their own property from continuing 
to do so.’’ 
Several companies, including Tiffany & 
Co., Apple, Richline, and lntel, have publicly 
emphasized the importance of supply chain 
due diligence. In 2017, 129 Investors, rep-
resenting over $4.8 trillion in assets stated in 
a letter to the SEC, that the due diligence 
disclosures required by Section 1502 provide 
valuable information about how companies 
manage supply chain risks. The U.S. conflict 
mineral law was the first of its kind and has 
spurred international action. Many other 
countries have since then passed similar 
laws holding companies responsible for the 
impact for supply chains. 
Opponents of the conflict minerals rule 
continue to use outdated information includ-
ing statistics from before or right after the 
rule’s implementation. Now, ten years after 
the passage of Section 1502 of the Dodd- 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act and eight years after the im-
plementation of the conflict minerals rule, 
we can make more accurate determinations 
about its success. Compliance costs were far 
lower than feared, and while challenges re-
main, data demonstrates a substantial re-
duction in the presence of armed groups in 
the mines. 
We hope you will use an accurate portrait 
of the impact of Dodd Frank 1502 as you con-
sider other legislative approaches that draw 
on this framework.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR SANDY 
SMITH OF MONROEVILLE 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my thanks and appreciation to Mayor 
Sandy Smith for her years of service to the 
people of Monroeville and Monroe County. All 
the area’s residents owe her a debt for her un-
wavering dedications over many years. 
As the longtime Executive Director of the 
Monroeville/Monroe County Chamber of Com-
merce, Sandy was tireless in pursuing jobs 
and economic development opportunities for 
all the county’s citizens. 
Once elevated to mayor, Sandy’s advocacy 
for Monroeville continued with the same pro-
fessionalism, positivity, kindness, and inclu-
siveness everyone who knows Sandy would 
expect. 
Throughout the years, Sandy has been in-
strumental in promoting Monroeville as the 
home of its native daughter, the beloved au-
thor Harper Lee, and making Monroeville the 
tourism center it is today. Truly, her heart is 
with Monroeville. 
I wish Sandy, Rayford, their children, and 
their growing family all the best. I know God 
will continue to bless them all.

IN MEMORY OF EMILIO 
GUGLIELMELLI, JR. 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in memory of Emilio 
Guglielmelli, Jr. A valiant World War II veteran 
who was a deeply treasured member of the 
Walla Walla, Washington community. 
Emilio was born and raised in Walla Walla, 
where he learned the values of hard work and 
the American dream on his family farm. After 
graduating from St. Vincent’s Academy, he 
took the brave call to serve our country during 
one of the world’s darkest times. After just 10 
weeks of basic training in the United States 
Army infantry, Emilio was sent to the Phil-
ippine Islands. After the liberation, Emilio con-
tinued his service in Japan until 1946 when he 
was welcomed home to the family farm. 
For the 50th Anniversary of the liberation, 
Emilio traveled back to the Philippines. He val-
ued this trip to be one of the highlights of his 
life. Emilio was proud to be a WWII veteran. 
Like so many of his brothers and sisters of the 
Greatest Generation, he would have never 
called himself a hero but he was. Emilio lived 
a full life of courage, honor, and love of coun-
try. 
Emilio and his wife Pauline S. Andreas 
raised a family full of several children, grand-
children, and great grandchildren. Emilio was 
a well-known and active community member, 
serving on several community leadership 
boards and clubs. His Walla Walla sweet on-
ions became a token best seller around town. 
Emilio was a talented drum player. He shared 
his love for music wherever he went. 
Emilio’s faith guided him in all that he did. 
His dedication to the Catholic Church was 
constant. Emilio frequently served as a lecture 
and volunteer for many St. Patrick Catholic 
Church masses and events. Because he 
shared his time and talents, he made the 
world around him a better place. 
On behalf of a grateful nation and the 
United States House of Representatives, I rise 
to remember Emilio and his remarkable legacy 
of service to our nation. I pray for comfort and 
peace to all who mourn his passing. May we 
honor Emilio’s legacy of service and sacrifice 
by continuing to honor him and all the mem-
bers of the Greatest Generation. We must 
never forget their sacrifices for keeping our 
freedom and the Promise of America alive.

EMPOWERING 
OLYMPIC, 
PARALYMPIC, 
AND 
AMATEUR 
ATHLETES ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad that today the House is considering 
S. 
2330, 
the 
Empowering 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act, the 
Senate companion to legislation I introduced 
in the House along with Representatives JOHN 
CURTIS, DIANA DEGETTE, and SUSAN BROOKS. 
I am incredibly thankful for the courageous 
survivors who stepped forward and whose ad-
vocacy made this legislation possible, and to 
Senators 
JERRY
MORAN
and 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL who authored this legislation. 
In 2016, I was shocked and angered when 
more than 300 brave gymnasts, including 
some from my congressional district, began to 
come forward with claims of sexual abuse 
against Larry Nassar, who had been the USA 
Gymnastics team doctor and a Michigan State 
University faculty member. 
I was similarly upset when only two years 
later, the Daily Breeze, a newspaper in my 
district, released the results of its investigation 
into USA Swimming. That investigation re-
vealed, ‘‘a culture within American swimming 
where the sexual abuse of underage swim-
mers by their coaches and others in positions 
of power within the sport was commonplace 
and even accepted by top officials and coach-
es.’’ 
The widespread and longstanding nature of 
the abuse as well as the knowledge that many 
allegations of abuse were brushed under the 
table have laid bare the deep systemic failures 
of the organizations charged with protecting 
athletes. The exposure of these abuses has 
necessitated immediate and aggressive reform 
of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Com-
mittee and the National Governing Bodies. 
That is why I was proud to introduce H.R. 
7881, the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, 
and Amateur Athletes Act. This bipartisan leg-
islation helped build broad support for the re-
forms in S. 2330 and ultimately usher them 
through the House of Representatives and 
onto the President’s desk to become law. 
Our legislation seeks to protect amateur ath-
letes from emotional, physical, and sexual 
abuse in numerous ways. To strengthen ac-
countability, it imposes legal liability for the 
USOPC and the NGBs when coaches or em-
ployees sexually abuse athletes. In addition, it 
establishes mechanisms to allow Congress to 
dissolve the entities if necessary. To empower 
athletes, the bill requires the establishment of 
clear procedures and reporting requirements, 
imposes clear responsibilities to protect ath-
letes, and bolsters the Office of the Ombuds 
to give athletes an independent resource if 
they have been abused or assaulted. Finally, 
the bill strengthens and provides a steady 
funding stream for the U.S. Center for 
SafeSport, which provides abuse prevention 
education and training and investigates allega-
tions of sexual abuse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E934 
October 6, 2020 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to those sur-
vivors who bravely spoke up about the horrific 
abuses that they endured and then turned 
their grief into advocacy. It is my hope that 
their work and this legislation will bring lasting, 
positive change to the sports world. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

HONORING GEORGE WASHINGTON 
BIGGS 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of George Wash-
ington Biggs, who passed away on Saturday, 
September 19, 2020, at the age of 95. A na-
tive son of Arizona, George was a legend 
among us and the last remaining Tuskegee 
Airman in our state who valiantly served in 
World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. For his 
selfless service and sacrifice, he was awarded 
the Congressional Medal of Honor—the high-
est civilian recognition given by Congress. 
George was a hero with unwavering patriotism 
who fought tirelessly to uphold and preserve 
American values, and our country’s indebted-
ness to him will forever stand the test of time. 
Born in Nogales, Arizona, to a family with a 
history of military service, George answered 
the call to duty early in his life. At age 18, he 
joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and served as 
a member of the Tuskegee Airmen—the first 
Black military aviators to fly in combat during 
World War II. George and his fellow airmen 
overcame racism and discrimination and 
played a significant role in the eventual inte-
gration of the United States armed forces. 
George returned to civilian life in 1946, but 
his heart remained on the frontlines, and he 
reenlisted in the U.S. Air Force, where he 
would go on to fight in the Korean War as a 
Second Lieutenant. Following the ceasefire in 
Korea, George returned to the states and was 
stationed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 
Tucson, Arizona, where he trained and 
mentored Black airmen. In 1970, George re-
tired from the military after flying his final mis-
sion during the Vietnam War. 
His life was forever intertwined with those 
he served alongside-never forgetting the sac-
rifices our brave men and women make to 
preserve the American way of life. Each Me-
morial Day, George would visit the Nogales 
City Cemetery where his father was buried to 
plant flags over the graves of veterans to 
honor them. 
As a nation, we join his wife, Olga, their 10 
children, 22 grandchildren, 24 great-grand-
children, and loved ones in honoring George. 
A man of unshakeable conviction, courage, 
and dedication, George’s legacy will remain 
synonymous of a true American patriot. Thank 
you for your service, George and Godspeed. 
TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE 
OF LEWIS W. BUTLER 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of Lewis W. Butler. 
Lewis was born in San Francisco, California, 
on March 27, 1957, the son of Lewis H. and 
Sheana Butler, and died on September 17, 
2020 at the age of 63 at his home in San 
Francisco. 
Lewis grew up in San Francisco with the ex-
ception of the two years spent in Malaysia 
while his father served as the Director of the 
Peace Corps there, and time in Washington, 
D.C. while his father served in what was then 
the Department of Health, Education and Wel-
fare. Lewis earned his undergraduate degree 
in civil engineering from Stanford and a Mas-
ter’s in architecture from Harvard University. 
After their Harvard graduations in 1985, he 
and his wife Catherine Armsden formed Butler 
Armsden, a successful architecture firm in San 
Francisco. 
Lewis is described as an inventive mod-
ernist residential architect with a prominent cli-
entele. He is also described as a teacher, a 
mentor, and a confident man with a can-do at-
titude. He possessed a great sense of humor 
and a humble demeanor. 
He was a true gentleman, a winner of 
countless merit awards who took no particular 
pride in showing them off. He was a surfer 
and a vintage British motorcycle afficionado 
and he built sand castles as part of a non- 
profit fundraiser. He was devoted to his com-
munity and served on the boards of the Ham-
lin School, University High School and the San 
Francisco Girls Chorus. 
Lewis W. Butler leaves his wife of 37 years, 
Catherine Armsden, his son, Tobias, his 
daughter Elena, his father Lewis H. Butler, 
and his sisters Serra and Lucy. He also leaves 
four nephews and three nieces. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
and work of this good and great man. He has 
left an indelible imprint on the architecture of 
the San Francisco Peninsula and beyond, and 
his friendship has left an imprint on the lives 
of so many who had the good fortune to know 
him. Lew Butler was a national treasure. He 
strengthened our community, bettered our na-
tion, and was a true blessing in every way 
imaginable.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise-today 
in support of H. Res. 1154, condemning 
QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it 
promotes. Although my vote was not recorded, 
I strongly support this resolution. I spoke on 
the floor on Thursday to commend Represent-
atives MALINOWSKI and RIGGLEMAN for their 
leadership on this issue. I was pleased to vote 
yes on the Rule. I have been targeted by 
QAnon on social media and have seen per-
sonally the absurdity and danger of their be-
liefs to our political system and to our coun-
tries historical beliefs in truth and in reality.

REINTRODUCTION OF THE FOOD 
DESERTS ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 6, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
food security is quickly becoming a national 
crisis that we must address. In my district 
alone, 1 in 5 people live in a food desert 
where grocery stores are unfortunately closing 
down, taking away healthy options and prices 
are skyrocketing for smaller stores. Too many 
families already lack a car or reliable public 
transportation to get to the nearest alternative, 
often located over a mile away. Today, thou-
sands of my constituents are struggling to find 
the food they need, with many forced to rely 
on fast food and convenience stores. These 
options are neither healthy nor affordable. 
These problems have only been made worse 
by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Sadly, this situation is not unique. Over 29 
million people, almost 10 percent of the U.S. 
population, live without ready access to afford-
able, nutritious food and over 2 million people 
have no transportation to get to their nearest 
store. Many have seen their local stores close 
their doors during the recent economic down-
turn. Others lost access years ago and are 
now facing the serious long-term impacts of 
obesity, diabetes, malnutrition and other diet 
related ailments. Unfortunately, residents in 
these low-income areas tend to spend less on 
groceries, leaving little financial incentive for 
traditional grocery chains to make costly in-
vestments for new locations. 
In the wealthiest country on Earth, nutritious 
food should be an expectation, not a luxury. 
That is why I am reintroducing the Food 
Deserts Act, which creates new avenues to 
fund stores in underserved communities. This 
bill will create USDA funding for state oper-
ated revolving funds that will issue low interest 
loans for the operation of grocery stores in 
food deserts. The bill ensures that recipients 
of these loans, including for-profit, non-profit 
and municipal entities, will provide affordable, 
healthy food, including fresh produce and sta-
ples like milk, bread and meat. It will also en-
sure that USDA professionals are available to 
provide technical assistance to recipients who 
need it. 
Access to healthy food is something that 
most of us take for granted. But despite our 
own experiences, we need to remember that 
millions of our constituents are struggling 
every day to feed their families. With this mar-
ket driven approach, I hope to complement ex-
isting federal programs and efforts around the 
country by ensuring a stable lending stream 
for struggling grocery stores and sustainable 
access to food for communities in need. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Food Deserts Act.
