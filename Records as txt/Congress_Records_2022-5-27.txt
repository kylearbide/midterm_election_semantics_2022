PRAYER 
Reverend Russell Gordon, Lutheran

ington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
God of creation, we praise You for 
the sheer beauty of this world, for its 
astonishing diversity among plants and 
animals and peoples who together call 
this place home. We pray for Your gra-
cious providence to encourage us in 
being responsible caretakers of all that 
You have made, to respect the delicate 
nature of the Earth, and to preserve 
this wondrous world for our children 
and grandchildren to enjoy. 
We most especially pray this day for 
those families who have recently lost 
their children and loved ones due to 
gun violence. Bring them a good meas-
ure of Your comfort and Your peace. 
As we begin this Memorial weekend, 
help us, O God, to do so humbly, grate-
ful for the utmost sacrifice made by 
those in uniform in all fields of con-
flict, lives given so we may enjoy the 
fruits of life and liberty. We pray for 
those families who still feel their loss. 
May their supreme offering inspire this 
Nation and its leaders to strive for 
those ways that lead to greater unity, 
justice, freedom, and peace. 
Amen.

IN MEMORY OF GREG MUDGE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
celebrate the memory of Greg Mudge, a long-
time community member and business owner 
in Detroit, Michigan, who we tragically lost last 
year. 
Greg was a beloved member of our commu-
nity, and his sudden death was a shock to us 
all. When he first opened Mudgie’s Deli under 
his ownership back in 2008, Greg was already 
a member of the community. A food service 
veteran, he built and managed his own busi-
ness with the heart and soul of family. His ap-
proach was ‘‘all hands on deck,’’ and he never 
shied away from any task and always gave a 
helping hand to any of his team. 
Greg was a deli sandwich craftsman com-
mitted to serving high-quality food. Many of his 
menu offerings were made from scratch. He 
incorporated family recipes, like his grand-
mother’s meatloaf, into his menu items. The 
homemade food made Mudgie’s Deli a neigh-
borhood standout. More than that, Greg’s en-
thusiasm and passion for his work shined 
through in all that he did. 
Always greeting guests with a warm smile, 
Greg Mudge embodied the spirit of our south-
west Detroit neighborhoods. Please join me in 
honoring his memory.

RECOGNIZING 
LOVEY 
HAMMEL 
AND DENISE MCPHAIL AT THE 
12TH ANNUAL HYLTON CENTER 
ANNIVERSARY GALA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the honorees of the 12th 
Annual Hylton Center Gala, Lovey Hammel 
and Denise McPhail, who have demonstrated 
incredible dedication and service to The 
Hylton Performing Arts Center. The Hylton 
Performing Arts Center serves to enrich, en-
tertain, and celebrate the community through 
arts and educational programs. The Hylton 
Performing Arts Center provides a variety of 
cultural experiences for all ages, and we are 
thankful to have this Center in our community. 
Lovey Hammel has served as the President 
of Employment Enterprises, Inc. for more than 
forty years, working to ensure everyone has 
the skills and opportunities they need to suc-
ceed in Northern Virginia. She worked tire-
lessly throughout her educational career and 
has given back to these institutions, including 
the Mason Board of Visitors, to which Gov-
ernor Tim Kaine appointed her. Lovey has 
also served as the Chair of both the Prince 
William County Chamber of Commerce and 
the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. 
Her family has been dedicated to the Hylton 
Center before its conception. Lovey’s mother, 
the late Jana Yeates, served as the Marketing 
and Outreach Committee Chair on the initial 
campaign to bring the Center into reality. As a 
display of their love for the performing arts 
and the work they put into creating the Hylton 
Center, Lovey’s parents generously gave to 
the Center to name the Lovey Hammel 
Lounge in their daughter’s honor. She and her 
family are landmark members of the Hylton 
Center’s legacy. 
Denise McPhail is the Co-Founder and Ex-
ecutive Director of the Creative and Per-
forming Arts Center, Inc. (CAPAC), a position 
she has proudly held for years. CAPAC serves 
as a bridge to connect underserved commu-
nities with access to and inclusion in the per-
forming arts. Under Denise’s leadership, 
CAPAC has helped hundreds of students ex-
perience the thrill of performance. 
After more than thirty years of civil service, 
Denise has retired, but her commitment to the 
Hylton 
Performing 
Arts 
Center 
has 
not 
wavered. She supported the Center before the 
ground was even broken, wowing audiences 
with CAPAC performances at the outset of 
Hylton’s construction. As a current member of 
the Center’s Executive Board, Denise con-
tinues to enshrine Northern Virginia’s dedica-
tion to the arts, and this honor could not be 
more fitting for a woman of her commitment 
and expertise. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending this year’s Hylton Cen-
ter honorees. Lovey Hammel and Denise 
McPhail have dedicated themselves to making 
the arts accessible and remain invaluable 
members of the Northern Virginia community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 2022 
DAVIS NEW MEXICO SCHOLARS 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the recipients of the Davis 
New Mexico Scholarship for their outstanding 
academic and personal achievement. 
Founded in 2014 to ensure that more first- 
generation college-going New Mexican stu-
dents complete a four-year degree, the Davis 
New Mexico Scholarship’s mission is to break 
the generational opportunity gap in higher 
education. 
I congratulate and commend each of the 
2022 Davis New Mexico Scholars. The recipi-
ents 
include: 
Joshua 
Abeyta, 
Yamilenia 
Aguilar Diaz, Edwin Aranda Martinez, Jessica 
Arevalo, Diego Armendariz, Andres Arroyo- 
Cano, Norely Breceda Mendoza, Amanda 
Carey, Omar Carmona, Rodriguez, Simrat 
Chauhan, Jorge Chumacero, Aiden Cruz, 
Kaylin Francisco, Nathaly Galindo, Kevin 
Granillo Herna´ndez, Antony Ha, Jeisha Her-
nandez, Dominique Herrera, Minh Hoyer, 
Esmeralda Jasso Laguna, Mary Jensen, Perla 
Juarez, Hariah Lewis Gleason, Kylen Littlehat, 
Hailey Loya, Juan Loya, Ingrid Luevano Flo-
res, Jamie Lujan, Rayvan Luna, Isaiah Madril, 
Megan Manzanares, Elvis Marin, Mariah 
Mejillas-Rivera, 
Isabella 
Pacheco, 
Araceli 
Pen˜a, Tse-Whang Pen˜a, Veronica Perez, 
Betzabed Ramirez, Aldo Rios, Abigail Rios 
Guevara, Victoria Rivera, Amy Segura, Alana 
Smith, Clara Sotelo, Bridget Valdez, Joaquin 
Valencia, Ximena Valencia Lozoya, Pete 
Velarde, Alec Vigil, and Ajahrain Yellowhair. 
These students are among the best in New 
Mexico. It takes a tremendous amount of will-
power and hard work to pursue a college edu-
cation, especially when you’re the first in your 
family to go to college. 
Whether they study in New Mexico or else-
where, the recipients of the 2022 Davis New 
Mexico Scholarship, they will continue to make 
our state proud. I join their families and com-
munities in wishing them well on their college 
journey.

RECOGNITION OF THE BATTLE OF 
ORMOC BAY 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
to recognize our brave servicemembers and 
allies that fought in the Battle of Ormoc Bay 
during World War II. One of the fiercest battles 
of the war, Ormoc Bay proved pivotal in the 
Pacific and the liberation of the Philippines. 
By October 1944, the tide in the Pacific had 
begun to shift in favor of the United States 
and our allies. Recognizing the strategic im-
portance of the Philippines, soldiers from the 
U.S. Sixth Anny landed on Leyte Island. 
The Battle of Ormoc Bay was pivotal in the 
liberation of the Philippines and began on No-
vember 11 when U.S. 3rd Fleet Commander 
Admiral William Halsey ordered an air attack 
on two resupply convoys approaching the bay, 
followed by mine sweepers Pursuit and Re-
venge and Destroyer Squadron 22 entering 
Ormoc Bay. 
The battle had a significant impact on 
Ormoc. The port suffered significant damage,

and casualties mounted. As the fighting inten-
sified, Filipino community leaders worked to 
save lives and countless civilians evacuated 
from the area with many families sheltering in 
the mountains. 
In a push to gain control of the port at 
Ormoc, on December 7 infantry regiments of 
the 77th Division conducted an amphibious 
landing 3 miles south of Ormoc. In the most 
intense aerial battle of the Leyte Campaign, 
allied aircraft dropped 97,000 pounds of muni-
tions on enemy shipping sinking several ships. 
Over 75 vessels of the Ormoc Attack Group 
came under constant and intense kamikaze 
attack. The destroyers Ward and Mahan were 
lost in the engagement with several other 
ships badly damaged. The Battle of Ormoc 
Bay was the only naval engagement during 
the war where the enemy brought every type 
of weapon to bear against the Allies. 
The Battle of Ormoc Bay brought terrible 
destruction and incalculable loss of life. Count-
less individuals risked their lives to free a na-
tion with thousands making the ultimate sac-
rifice. Before being able to celebrate the lib-
eration of the Philippines, many Filipinos 
bravely fought for freedom and suffered tre-
mendous loss throughout the war. 
Madam Speaker, we are once again hon-
ored to remember all those who sacrificed in 
the liberation of the Philippines. Their dedica-
tion paved the way to victory in the Pacific and 
provides us an example to which we all strive 
to live up to. I urge my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing these outstanding heroes.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend George Mason University’s 
50th Anniversary. 
In 1957, George Mason College was estab-
lished as the Northern Virginia branch of the 
University of Virginia. Mayor John ‘‘Jack’’ 
Wood and the then-Town of Fairfax were in-
strumental in acquiring the original 150 acres 
of land for the Fairfax Campus in 1958. Short-
ly after, Rector John ‘‘Til’’ Hazel, Jr., helped 
acquire an additional 421 acres of land to ex-
pand the Fairfax Campus in 1969. 
Fifteen years after its inception, on April 7, 
1972, a contingent from George Mason Col-
lege met with Governor A. Linwood Holton in 
Richmond to sign House Bill 210, establishing 
George Mason University as a free-standing 
four-year public institution of higher education. 
George Mason University now operates three 
campuses in the Commonwealth—including 
the Fairfax campus that is located in Virginia’s 
11th District. 
George Mason University is home to aca-
demically driven students and professors, as 
well as state-of-the-art facilities and programs. 
GMU Professor James Buchanan won the 
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 
1986 and Professor Vernon Smith won the 
prize in 2002, making them the Common-
wealth of Virginia’s first two Nobel Memorial 
Prize recipients. The university achieved R1 
‘‘Highest Research Activity’’ status in 2016, 
and 2018, from the Carnegie Classification of 
Institutions of Higher Education. 
GMU has worked to provide opportunities 
for all and break down the barriers that often 
keep people from achieving academic suc-
cess. In 2018, GMU and Northern Virginia 
Community College created the ADVANCE 
program, a partnership that assisted students 
as they transfer from a two-year program to 
earn a bachelor’s degree, helping more than 
2,020 students through the pathway program. 
During the pandemic, 61 percent of GMU stu-
dents received some form of financial aid, in-
cluding almost a third of Undergraduates who 
received Pell Grants. A quarter of GMU’s un-
dergraduate students are first-generation col-
lege students, and approximately 1 in 12 GMU 
students are affiliated with the military, includ-
ing veterans, active-duty personnel, military 
dependents, reservists, and guardsmen. 
George Mason University is the most di-
verse, fastest growing, and largest public four- 
year institution in the Commonwealth, serving 
39,134 students with close to 11,000 staff and 
faculty. There are more than 215,900 GMU 
alumni, including 135,300 currently in Virginia. 
The hundreds of thousands of alumni are re-
flective of the 70 percent six-year graduation 
rate that has little to no disparity on ethnicity 
or economic status. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending George Mason Univer-
sity on its 50th Anniversary. GMU exemplifies 
the tremendous success that institutions of 
higher education can achieve when equity, di-
versity, and accessibility are of paramount im-
portance.

RECOGNIZING GBS AND CIDP 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the month of May as GBS 
CIDP Awareness Month and draw attention to 
the insidious nature of these terrible diseases. 
Guillain-Barre´ Syndrome (GBS) is an inflam-
matory disorder of the peripheral nerves out-
side the brain and spinal cord. GBS is charac-
terized by the rapid onset of numbness, weak-
ness, and often paralysis of the legs, arms, 
breathing muscles, and face. Paralysis is as-
cending, meaning that it travels up the limbs 
from fingers and toes towards the torso. Loss 
of reflexes, such as the knee jerk, are usually 
found. Usually. a new case of GBS is admitted 
to ICU (Intensive Care) to monitor breathing 
and other body functions until the disease is 
stabilized. Plasma exchange (a blood ‘‘cleans-
ing’’ procedure) and high dose intravenous im-
mune globulins are often helpful to shorten the 
course of GBS. The acute phase of GBS typi-
cally varies in length from a few days to 
months. Patient care involves the coordinated 
efforts of a team such as a neurologist, 
physiatrist (rehabilitation physician), internist, 
family physician, physical therapist, occupa-
tional therapist, social worker, nurse, and psy-
chologist or psychiatrist. Recovery may occur 
over six months to two years or longer. A par-
ticularly frustrating consequence of GBS is 
long-term recurrences of fatigue and/or ex-
haustion as well as abnormal sensations in-
cluding pain and muscle aches. 
Chronic 
Inflammatory 
Demyelinating 
Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare disorder of 
the peripheral nerves characterized by gradu-
ally increasing weakness of the legs and, to a 
lesser extent, the arms. It is the gradual onset 
as well as the chronic nature of CIDP that dif-
ferentiates it from GBS. Like GBS, CIDP is 
caused by damage to the covering of the 
nerves, called myelin. It can start at any age 
and in both genders. Weakness occurs over 
two or more months. Unlike GBS, CIDP is 
chronic, with symptoms constantly waxing and 
waning. Left untreated; 30 percent of CIDP 
patients will progress to wheelchair depend-
ence. Early recognition and treatment can 
avoid a significant amount of disability. Post- 
treatment life depends on whether the disease 
was caught early enough to benefit from treat-
ment options. The gradual onset of CIDP can 
delay diagnosis by several months or even 
years, resulting in significant nerve damage 
that may take several courses of treatment be-
fore benefits are seen. The chronic nature of 
CIDP differentiates long-term care from GBS 
patients. Adjustments inside the home may 
need to be made to facilitate a return to nor-
mal life. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing May as GBS CIDP Awareness Month. 
Together we can promote important scientific 
breakthroughs that improve the lives of individ-
uals and families battling GBS, CIDP and 
MMN.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
CURRAN SMOLINSKY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Curran Smolinsky and 
his service to Virginia’s First District and the 
Nation. 
Curran earned his bachelor’s degree in Po-
litical Science and Government from the Uni-
versity of Mary Washington, a prestigious uni-
versity in Virginia’s First District. As the Cap-
tain of the soccer team, Curran helped lead 
the Eagles to their first Continental Athletic 
Conference soccer championship in 16 years. 
Needless to say, Curran was as integral to the 
Mary Washington team as he was to my staff. 
Curran first joined my office as an intern in 
my office during the summer of 2015. During 
the summer of 2016, he rejoined my staff and 
assisted the other interns with integrating into 
our office. After graduation, Curran worked at 
Infinity Support Services as a program analyst, 
but after a call to rejoin our office, Curran 
gladly accepted. He has been with us for over 
three years now. During his time serving Vir-
ginia’s First District, Curran admirably worked 
as a staff assistant, and quickly climbed the 
professional ladder to become a Legislative 
Aide in the Spring of 2021. Throughout his 
tenure here, Curran always put the concerns 
of Virginia’s First District’s constituents first. 
Curran has devoted his talents to the com-
mon good and dedicated his heart and mind 
to civil service. I would like to thank Curran for 
his contributions over the past three years. I 
wish Curran the best as he continues his ca-
reer on the other side of the Potomac as he 
continues serving the nation at the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing Curran Smolinsky for his dedi-
cated service to Virginia’s First District. May

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LITERACY 
COUNCIL 
OF 
NORTHERN 
VIR-
GINIA’S 60 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 60th Anniversary of the 
Literary Council of Northern Virginia. 
Founded in 1962, the LCNV is the oldest lit-
eracy program in the state and one of the 
largest literacy councils in the nation. Through-
out its 60 years of service, the LCNV has 
adapted to the growing needs of the Northern 
Virginia community to serve adult learners at 
the lowest literacy level. 
Not only are they celebrating a milestone of 
60 years, but they are about to celebrate a 
milestone of serving 60,000 adult learners. By 
empowering tens of thousands of adult learn-
ers to better participate in their communities, 
LCNV is ensuring the economic success of 
hundreds of local families for a lifetime. 
With the help of dedicated volunteers, LCNV 
has become one of the more efficient and ef-
fective community-based literacy organizations 
in the country. In FY2021, despite being in the 
middle of a global pandemic, LCNV’s 436 vol-
unteers were able to put in a total of 16,344 
hours of service. LCNV was able to hold 
events to recruit and train volunteers, which 
helped the organization meet and work with 
204 new volunteers. These new volunteers 
were critical as the organization had to pivot to 
virtual programming for the year. The volun-
teers were able to provide substantial remote 
support to help their students use the online 
learning platforms. 
LCNV has spent the past six decades help-
ing people from all over the world achieve 
their goals and better their lives with literacy 
skills. On average each year, their students 
come from 90 different countries and speak 50 
different languages. Their commitment to 
meeting people where they are in their edu-
cational journey has allowed them to become 
a trusted resource in the community and a 
leader in adult education. In the fall of 2021, 
LCNV was called upon to help with literacy 
classes for refugees coming over from Af-
ghanistan. While their fall session had already 
started, LCNV quickly adapted and added 
classes for the students that would not have 
been able to wait for the next registration pe-
riod. To date, they have been able to help al-
most 170 Afghan refugees with English lit-
eracy skills. 
Literacy is not just about being able to read, 
it’s about being able to further your career, en-
gage in conversations with family and friends, 
and become more civically engaged. LCNV 
helps students reach their goals like voting for 
the first time or getting a promotion at their 
job. The skills gained in LCNV classrooms, 
both virtual and in-person, allow learners to 
improve wellness and attain healthier lifestyles 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing the 60th Anniversary of 
the Literacy Council of Northern Virginia. Its 
values of Integrity, Innovation, Respect, Col-
laboration, and Excellence have propelled it to 
success for the past 60 years and will con-
tinue to carry the Council through the next 60 
years. I also want to express my gratitude to 
the LCNV staff, Board of Directors, and count-
less volunteers who dedicate their time and 
resources to empower neighbors of our com-
munity to develop basic skills of reading, writ-
ing, and speaking English.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
ALBERT J. RINOW, SR. 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
Albert J. Rinow, Sr., who passed away on 
May 2, 2022, at the age of 96. 
Mr. Rinow worked at Trico for 43 years, all 
the while serving in the Lancaster Fire Depart-
ment. Mr. Rinow joined the Lancaster Fire De-
partment in 1950 with the Rescue Hook and 
Ladder Company and joined the Citizens Hose 
Company in 1954. For his service, in 2001 
and 2006, Mr. Rinow was awarded the Lan-
caster Fire Department Firefighter of the Year 
Award. From 2003 through 2017 Mr. Rinow 
served as the Lancaster Fire Department 
Chaplain, and in 2017, Mr. Rinow attained life 
membership status in the Lancaster Fire De-
partment, after 67 years of active service. For 
all his noble work with the Lancaster Fire De-
partment, Mr. Rinow was also named to the 
Erie County Department of Homeland Security 
and Emergency Services Wall of Honor. 
At the age of 20, Mr. Rinow married Shirley 
Pearles 
at 
Sacred 
Heart 
Church 
in 
Bowmansville, NY. Together, Mr. and Mrs. 
Rinow had six children: Judith; David; Daniel; 
Patricia; Albert, Jr.; and Nancy. Additionally, 
Mr. Rinow had 15 grandchildren, 26 great- 
grandchildren, and a great-great grandchild 
named Georgia. Of note, Mr. Rinow’s son 
Daniel and his grandson Marc are 3rd and 4th 
generation firefighters with the Lancaster Fire 
Department. 
Mr. Rinow was also a man of faith and ac-
tive in his church. Mr. Rinow worked as the 
cemetery director for St. Mary’s Cemetery and 
served as a Eucharistic minister for the 
church. In his free time, Mr. Rinow also was 
a basketball coach, and enjoyed fishing. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in mourn-
ing Mr. Rinow’s passing, and in honoring his 
life’s work and all his achievements.

IN HONOR OF DR. WILLIAM ROES 
RETIREMENT AFTER 40 YEARS 
OF SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Dr. William Roes for the 40 years 
that he has dedicated to the Key Peninsula 
community, where he served as the only fam-
ily doctor for decades. And like many others in 
our community, I want to wish him well as he 
enters retirement. 
Dr. William Roes graduated in 1973 from 
the University of Washington and attended 
medical school at the University of Nevada 
College of Medical Sciences and Washington 
University in St. Louis. Dr. Roes’ long career 
on the Key Peninsula began in 1980 when he 
came to work once a week at the Key Penin-
sula Health Center while completing his resi-
dency program at MultiCare Tacoma Family 
Medicine. After graduating from the residency 
program in August of 1981, Dr. Roes decided 
to call the area home and applied for the fam-
ily doctor position at The Key Peninsula Med-
ical Center. Dr. Roes began his full-time prac-
tice at The Key Peninsula Health Center as 
the only family doctor at the clinic until his 
‘‘soft retirement’’ shortly before the pandemic 
started. Dr. Roes still does home visits to con-
nect with his patients who are now in nursing 
homes and still helps with special projects at 
the clinic. 
Madam Speaker, beyond his tenure as a 
medical provider, I would also like to express 
gratitude for all that Dr. Roes has done to 
serve our community outside his clinic doors. 
When the pandemic first hit, Dr. Roes created 
his own PPE using painter’s suits and per-
formed COVID–19 tests at elderly patients’ 
homes. He has also served as the medical di-
rector for the Key Peninsula Fire Department 
and on the board for the Mustard Seed 
Project, a local nonprofit that provides services 
and programs for seniors residing on the Key 
Peninsula. For his compassionate commitment 
to improving the health and well-being of peo-
ple in the community, Dr. Roes was awarded 
the Washington State Family Physician of the 
Year in 2008. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor and 
celebrate Dr. William Roes—whose love for 
his community has never wavered and whose 
commitment and service to his patients and 
their families is greatly appreciated. He has an 
extraordinary legacy. He has made a real dif-
ference. And I am pleased to honor him in the 
United States House.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
CAPTAIN KIMBERLY SCHOPPA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of Fire Captain 
Kimberly Schoppa of Fairfax County, who re-
cently passed away after a battle with occupa-
tional cancer. 
Captain Schoppa joined Fairfax County Fire 
and Rescue in 2004. While serving her com-
munity, she quickly emerged as a leader 
among her peers. She was promoted to Cap-
tain of an engine at Station 27 in West Spring-
field and was a member of the Honor Guard 
at the time of her passing. 
In her career, Captain Schoppa took on the 
dangerous work of fire suppression. Her tal-
ents were widely recognized, but when talk 
turned to a future as a battalion chief, Captain 
Schoppa insisted that she wanted to be on the 
front line. She wanted to fight fires and save 
lives. Captain Schoppa’s peers knew that she 
would be happiest in the front seat of the fire 
truck, working firsthand to keep her community 
safe.

Though the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue 
Department has extensive protocols and miti-
gation techniques to prevent injuries and 
smoke 
inhalation 
on 
the 
job, 
Captain 
Schoppa’s repeated exposure over the course 
of her admirable career tragically developed 
into ovarian cancer, which the Department 
considers an occupational illness. Her death is 
recognized as being in the line of duty. 
Captain Schoppa’s friends and colleagues 
have lauded her character and service during 
her career and since her passing. She has 
been called a ‘‘valued friend,’’ and an ‘‘es-
teemed member of the department.’’ I have no 
doubt that she will be missed as her service 
has touched so many lives. I know that Fairfax 
County is a better place now because we had 
a hero like Captain Kimberly Schoppa. 
She is survived by her wife, Master Techni-
cian (retired) Kim Klaren, her parents Jan and 
Karl Schoppa, her brothers Chris (and partner 
Paul), and Brett (wife Amy and children Riley 
(fiance´ Anya), Abigail, and Maura); Klaren’s 
mother Shirley, brothers Bobby (wife Andrea 
and children Bo, Cody, and Tyler), Matt (wife 
Kay and children Kyle (fiance´ Elyse), Kacie, 
and Cole), and sister Kara (husband Mike). I 
have no doubt that many more will miss Cap-
tain Schoppa, as her work and her heroism 
touched countless more lives. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in honoring the service and excellence 
that Captain Schoppa displayed throughout 
her career. Her heroism should remind us to 
take every chance to help others. May her 
leadership and passion inspire us all to serve 
our communities to the best of our ability.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CITY OF CREST-
WOOD, MISSOURI 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an amazing community in 
my district. This year marks the 75th anniver-
sary of the City of Crestwood, Missouri. 
With a population of over 12,000 proud 
Americans, Crestwood has grown into a vi-
brant city since its incorporation in 1947. From 
its steadfast and hardworking Police and Fire 
Departments to its dedicated Parks and 
Recreation and Public Works Departments, 
the local government of Crestwood continues 
to provide outstanding public service to the 
families living there. 
Crestwood is also a city rich in history. It is 
the 
burial 
place 
of 
Sergeant 
John 
S. 
Sappington, who fought alongside George 
Washington during the Revolutionary War, and 
the city sits directly adjacent to the Ulysses S. 
Grant National Historic Site, or White Haven, 
where the former President and Civil War 
General lived with his family. 
Crestwood remains an incredible community 
to raise a family, with numerous outstanding 
schools, parks, and recreational facilities in the 
area. I want to thank the caring residents and 
public servants of Crestwood, who continue to 
work together to improve their community, and 
I have no doubt that the next 75 years will be 
even greater than the last. 
RECOGNIZING THE ONE-YEAR AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
JABARA- 
HEYER NO HATE ACT 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of last Friday, May 20, 2022, being 
the one-year anniversary of President Biden 
signing into law the COVID–19 Hate Crimes 
Act, which included the Jabara-Heyer NO 
HATE Act. 
This law was named after victims of two 
high-profile hate crimes: Khalid Jabara, who 
was killed in 2016 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and 
Heather Heyer, who was murdered in Char-
lottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The murders of 
these two individuals were prosecuted as hate 
crimes but not reported in hate crime statis-
tics. 
The Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act is aimed at 
improving hate crime statistics and promoting 
a better response to hate crime within commu-
nities. At a time when hate crimes against 
Asian American communities as well as hate 
crimes against other people of color, religious 
minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, 
and the LGBTQ community are increasing, 
this legislation is crucial to driving community- 
centered policies that reflect the needs of peo-
ple targeted for hate. 
Through this bill, Congress and the Presi-
dent sent a powerful message that we must 
center communities targeted for hate and in-
vest resources to meet their needs. The legis-
lation is a significant first step in achieving 
meaningful 
hate 
crime 
reporting 
and 
prioritizing law enforcement accountability and 
community empowerment in the federal, state, 
and local responses to hate crime. 
I want to also commend the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights for 
their work to mark the anniversary last week 
with a celebration of Humanity Over Hate, cul-
minating in a webinar that featured interviews 
with the families of victims of hate, including 
Heather Heyer’s mother Susan Bro and Khalid 
Jabara’s sister Victoria Jabara. 
In the wake of the horrific tragedy in Buffalo, 
where an alleged white supremacist murdered 
10 people, most of whom were Black, it is 
more important than ever that we commit to 
confronting anti-Black hatred and white su-
premacy. 
Please join me in commemorating the one- 
year anniversary of the Jabara-Heyer NO 
HATE Act and continuing to confront anti- 
Black hatred and white supremacy.

HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY 
CAREER 
OF 
JUDGE 
CHARLES 
PRICE 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the extraordinary accomplishments of 
legal scholar, attorney, jurist, and public serv-
ant, Judge Charles Price. 
A native of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, Judge Price is a graduate of Carver 
High School in Montgomery, Alabama. Upon 
graduation, he served six years in the United 
States Army—three years with the Green 
Beret Special Forces and three years with the 
82nd Airborne Division. After discharge, he 
continued to serve his country by joining the 
United States Army Reserve. Retiring as a 
Lieutenant Colonel, Judge Advocate General’s 
Corps, he received numerous Meritorious 
Service Medals, awards, and commendations 
for his faithful service to our country. 
Judge Price continued his education at Vir-
ginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, 
before earning his law degree with honors 
from the George Washington School of Law in 
Washington, D.C. After completing his edu-
cation, he began his legal career in the Civil 
Division at the Department of Justice in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Moving back to his home state of Alabama, 
in 1973, Judge Price became the Assistant At-
torney General for the State of Alabama. The 
following year, he made history, becoming the 
first Black District Attorney for Escambia 
County and the only Black district attorney in 
the country. Showing his skill as a legal schol-
ar and jurist, Judge Price went on to serve as 
the Deputy District Attorney for Montgomery 
County in 1975 before entering the private 
practice in 1978. 
Reentering public service in 1982, Judge 
Price was appointed Assistant Municipal 
Judge for the City of Montgomery. Continuing 
to break down barriers, Judge Price made his-
tory again in 1983 after Governor George Wal-
lace appointed him as Montgomery County 
Circuit Judge, making him the first Black per-
son to hold the position in Montgomery Coun-
ty. After serving for one year, he won the elec-
tion to his first six-year term in 1984, winning 
reelection in 1990 and 1996. Judge Price re-
tired after 32 years on the bench on January 
9, 2015. 
Outside of his career in the courtroom, 
Judge Price expanded his legacy into the 
classroom serving as an adjunct professor of 
Political Science and Criminal Justice at Ala-
bama State University, adjunct professor of 
law at Jones School of Law and at the Univer-
sity of Alabama Law School, and member of 
the Board of Trustees at Tuskegee University. 
He has two honorary doctorates; one for law 
from the University of West Alabama in 2001 
and the other in Christian Humanities from the 
Global Evangelical Christian College and 
Seminary in 2005. 
As a vibrant member of his community, 
Judge Price is a proud member of the St. 
John’s African Methodist Episcopal Church in 
Montgomery, where he serves as a steward 
and Sunday school teacher. His civic affili-
ations include Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., 
Sigma Phi Boule Fraternity, Inc., President of 
the Montgomery Trial Lawyers Association, 
President of the Alabama Circuit Judge’s As-
sociation, member of the National Bar Asso-
ciation, the Alabama State Bar Association, 
the Alabama Lawyers Association, the Mont-
gomery County Bar Association, and the Cap-
ital City Bar Association. Judge Price has also 
served as president of the Alabama Circuit 
Judges Association and Presiding Judge of 
the 15th Judicial Circuit. 
Known for his fairness, integrity, and dedica-
tion to the law, Judge Price has received nu-
merous awards and honors, including the 
prestigious 1997 John F. Kennedy Profile in 
Courage Award, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

He is also the recipient of the 2000 National 
Bar Association’s Raymond Pace Alexander 
Award and in 2006 the Association’s Wiley 
Branton Award. In 2009, the Montgomery 
County Court House was dedicated as the 
Phelps-Price Justice Center in memory of 
Judge Joseph Phelps and in honor of Judge 
Price. That same year he received the 
Thurgood 
Marshall 
Lifetime 
Achievement 
Award from the Imperial Council of the Prince 
Hall Shriners. 
On a personal note, Judge Price has always 
been a trusted mentor and source of wise 
counsel and wisdom. His daughter Susan and 
I were college schoolmates at Princeton. I am 
so grateful for the way his family embraced 
me as one of their own. As a trailblazer and 
legal icon, Judge Price is a true inspiration 
and admiration for so many of us. Congratula-
tions to Judge Price for your significant con-
tributions to the City of Montgomery and the 
State of Alabama. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary career of a legal 
powerhouse, Judge Price, for his decades of 
service to the State of Alabama and this na-
tion.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF TOMMY 
HAROLD MINK 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Tommy Harold 
Mink in celebration of his retirement from the 
Rockcastle County Industrial Development 
Board in Mount Vernon, Kentucky, where he 
has dedicated 45 years of service to the com-
munity and southeastern Kentucky. 
Mr. Mink has been instrumental in providing 
wisdom and guidance for industrial develop-
ment, job creation, and economic growth in 
Rockcastle 
County, 
beginning 
with 
the 
Rockcastle County Improvement Board and 
continuing to aid in acquisition, retention, and 
development of local land for new opportuni-
ties for more than four decades as a charter 
member of the Rockcastle County Industrial 
Development Board. 
Mr. Mink is also a member of the Kentucky 
Cattleman’s Association Hall of Fame, as a re-
sult of his life-long, successful career in the 
farming industry. His passion for farming 
began as a child in Rockcastle County where 
he was born and raised on a 35-acre dairy 
farm. He became a first-generation college 
graduate in his family, earning a degree in ag-
riculture in 1958. Today, he and his sons still 
own and operate a 350 cow/calf and back- 
grounding operation. 
His expertise has been highly sought after 
by a number of local and state organizations, 
including serving as a board member of the 
Rockcastle County Cattlemen’s Association 
since 1985, serving as Master Conservationist 
in 1981, a charter member of the Rockcastle 
County Forage Council, the Rockcastle Coun-
ty Soil Conservation District since 1982 and 
Chairman from 1983 to 2019, a charter mem-
ber of the Rockcastle County Saddle Club for 
more than 20 years, an Extension Agency 
Board Member, Chairman of the Western 
Rockcastle Water District, the Farmers Home 
Administration, a Farm Bureau board member, 
the Vocational Educational Regional Advisory 
Board in Harlan County, and a court-appointed 
appraiser for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
He is also Chairman of the Brindle Ridge Fire 
Department, a founding member of Cedar 
Rapids Country Club, and a deacon of the 
Brindle Ridge Baptist Church. Mr. Mink has 
also been a Kentucky Colonel since the late 
1960’s. 
As a veteran of the U.S. Army, with two 
tours of active duty from 1959 to 1966, this 
nation owes Mr. Mink a great debt of gratitude 
for his military service. His overall lifetime of 
service is truly inspiring, from working on the 
farm as a young boy, to becoming a member 
of the U.S. Armed Forces, to establishing a 
Veterans Honor Guard in Rockcastle County, 
to building a successful business and pro-
viding tireless community service throughout 
his entire adult life. 
Mr. Mink has sincerely earned his due re-
tirement and I wish him and his family the very 
best in the years to come.

REMEMBERING MIKE EVANHOE 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
along with Congressman JIMMY PANETTA and 
Congresswoman ESHOO to recognize the life 
and service of Mike Evanhoe, who passed 
away last year. 
Mike Evanhoe was as member of the 
Danville community for many years and spent 
his career working to improve California’s 
transportation system to better serve the re-
gional community and economy. 
Mike began his career working for the Cali-
fornia 
Department 
of 
Transportation 
and 
served as Assistant Secretary for Transpor-
tation in the Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency for Governor Brown. 
He played an instrumental role in securing 
support for AB 402, which facilitated new, col-
laborative approaches to transportation project 
implementation. He later served as the first 
Executive Director of the California Transpor-
tation Commission, Executive Director of the 
Golden Triangle Task Force, and then as Ex-
ecutive Director of the new Santa Clara Coun-
ty Congestion Management Agency. 
In these roles, he worked on several com-
plex transportation issues, from the Sunol 
Grade project on I–680 to the construction of 
the interchange between State Routes 85 and 
101. In fact, because of his service, the Cali-
fornia Legislature named that particular sec-
tion of our roadway in southern San Jose as 
the ‘‘Michael Evanhoe interchange.’’ 
Mike continued his service as the interim 
Executive Director for Stanislaus County 
Council of Governments where he played a 
pivotal role helping the Transbay Joint Powers 
Authority in San Francisco secure necessary 
approvals to transfer excess state property to 
the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. 
Mike was known for his exemplary leader-
ship and development of strong relationships 
with staff as well as local, state, and regional 
agencies. He retired in 2014, after addressing 
California’s transportation issues for nearly 50 
years. 
Mike is survived by his partner, David; sis-
ter, Pam; and his niece, Sherri. He was a 
friend and mentor to many and will be missed.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
THIRTY-SIX 
YEAR PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER 
OF ALEXANDRIA COUNCILWOMAN 
DEL PEPPER 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Redella S. Pepper, the 
recently retired Councilwoman from Alexan-
dria, Virginia, for her thirty-six years of dedi-
cated public service. 
Ms. Pepper, known to many as Del, won 
her first election to Alexandria’s city council in 
1985 after serving as an aide to Mayor 
Charles Beatley. Once she ran for and won 
her seat on the council, she treated her office 
as a full-time job. As other council members 
have served diligently while maintaining other 
commitments, Del Pepper’s sole priority has 
been bettering her community for nearly four 
decades. She was on the council longer than 
any other incumbent and served as Alexan-
dria’s vice mayor from 1996 to 1997 and from 
2003 to 2009. 
Even before her involvement in Alexandria, 
Del Pepper found herself fighting for others. 
She worked on her father’s city council cam-
paign growing up in Omaha, Nebraska. In the 
1960s, Ms. Pepper managed a regional head-
quarters during President Lyndon Johnson’s 
campaign. This would be impressive today, 
but Del did it in a time when women rarely 
took on such prominent roles in politics. She 
moved to Alexandria in 1968 and hit the 
ground running with her desire to serve. 
Del Pepper has been an outspoken advo-
cate for compassion, and the residents of Al-
exandria recognize that. She has remained a 
voice for the West End, ensuring that her part 
of town has had representation in the council 
all along the way. Ms. Pepper has advocated 
for seniors, too, making Alexandria a more ac-
cessible place to live. 
The residents of Alexandria have elected 
Del Pepper with more votes than any of the 
other at large councilmembers three times, 
leading to her recognition as vice mayor. She 
has voted in the best interests of her commu-
nity, fighting for the environment by shutting 
down a coal plant and leading the charge to 
make Alexandria an Eco-City in 2008. Del 
even served on the Metropolitan Washington 
Council of Governments’ Air Quality Com-
mittee and Board of Directors. 
Del Pepper also served beyond her City 
Council seat by working on Alexandria’s Com-
mission on Aging, ensuring that senior citizens 
have access to the resources needed to live 
full and independent lives. Additionally, she 
worked on the Facilities Naming Committee, 
where she ensured that our landmarks would 
honor those who deserved the praise. Del also 
worked with the Commission on Information

Technology to keep her community secure 
and equipped to meet her constituents’ needs. 
Personally, I was honored to work with Del 
on the Council of Governments, where she led 
as the board’s president. Del has done the 
hard and thankless work that very few people 
often recognize. But the entire Washington 
metropolitan area is better off because of the 
tireless service she put in. 
Ms. Pepper is a pillar of the Alexandria 
community, unafraid to speak her mind and 
vote with her conscience. She has been a 
comfort to her constituents and ensured that 
their voices were heard by the whole of Alex-
andria’s city council. She has served her com-
munity since before some of her colleagues 
were even born. Del Pepper’s dedication is 
unmatched, and I am proud to offer my con-
gratulations to a treasured friend and col-
league on a full, fearless, and caring career in 
service to the public. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending Ms. Del Pepper on her 
thirty-six years on the Alexandria city council. 
Ms. Pepper has set an example that all of us 
would do well to follow in fighting for what she 
believes, in giving a voice to her constituents 
in the decisions that affect them, and in being 
a resource to her community. She is a unique 
and invaluable member of her community, and 
I am proud that I have had the opportunity to 
get to know her, may we all strive to be more 
like her in our own service.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DI-
RECT 
THE 
SECRETARY 
OF 
TRANSPORTATION TO SUBMIT A 
REPORT 
ON 
HELICOPTER 
AND 
ROTOCRAFT NOISE IN THE DIS-
TRICT OF COLUMBIA FRIDAY 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I in-
troduce a bill that would direct the Secretary of 
Transportation to submit a report to Congress 
containing recommendations on how to reduce 
helicopter noise in the District of Columbia. 
Such recommendations would include altitude, 
number of flights, flight paths, time of day of 
flights, types of aircraft, operating procedures 
and pilot training. The Secretary would be re-
quired to consult with any federal agencies or 
departments that fly helicopters in D.C., the 
Metropolitan Police Department, any medical 
helicopter operators that routinely fly in D.C. 
and any other operator that routinely flies a 
helicopter in D.C. The report would be due to 
Congress no later than 180 days after the en-
actment of the bill. 
Even though D.C. has the most restricted 
airspace in the country, I hear from D.C. resi-
dents almost daily about the negative impact 
of helicopter noise on their lives. The noise 
can harm health and quality of life, and heli-
copters can even harm the structural integrity 
of homes. While I recognize the need for heli-
copters in D.C., the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration (FAA) and Congress must do more to 
mitigate the harm to D.C. residents. 
In 2019, I led members of the National Cap-
ital Region (NCR) in requesting that the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) study 
helicopter noise in the NCR. Last year, GAO 
issued its report. GAO found that there had 
been nearly 90,000 helicopter flights in the 
NCR from 2017 to 2019. GAO recommended 
that the FAA develop a mechanism to ex-
change helicopter noise information with oper-
ators in the NCR. The FAA indicated that it 
would implement such a mechanism. In March 
2021, I introduced the Washington, DC Area 
Helicopter Noise Information Exchange Act of 
2021, which would require the FAA to imple-
ment such a mechanism. In April 2022, I intro-
duced the Reducing Helicopter Noise in the 
District of Columbia Act, which would require 
all helicopters in D.C. to fly at the maximum 
altitude permitted by the FAA in D.C., with lim-
ited exceptions. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
recognize the hard work of the southwest De-
troit community and board members of Tri-City 
Community Development Corporation who 
made the groundbreaking at Eden Park pos-
sible. 
As we gather to break ground at the former 
site of Mark Twain School, we are reminded of 
the possibility of rebirth. This space holds the 
promise of a community green space that will 
serve the needs of our neighbors. It will be a 
place to gather, a central green space to enjoy 
the outdoors. As construction of the park com-
mences, I look forward to seeing a space de-
signed that will be embraced and enjoyed by 
people of all ages. It is my hope that Eden 
Park will exemplify what it means to be a 
place to commune. Its goals for hosting a 
playground, community garden, classes, and 
other recreational activities, will truly set it 
apart to become a jewel of the community. 
Please join me in tribute to the communities 
of southwest Detroit and the Tri-City CDC as 
they break ground on Eden Park.

HONORING MARY JANE BURKE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mary Jane Burke upon 
her retirement from Marin County Office of 
Education as its intrepid Superintendent of 
Marin County Public Schools for nearly two 
decades and for a lifetime of extraordinary 
public service. 
Raised in Stockton, California, as the eldest 
of eight siblings, Mary Jane moved to Marin at 
the age of 18 to attend Dominican University 
in San Rafael. She graduated with a bach-
elor’s degree in education in 1973 and pro-
ceeded to also earn her master’s degree in 
special education in 1976. Since then, she has 
served our community as a teacher, principal, 
special education director, assistant super-
intendent, and deputy superintendent. In 1995, 
following the death of her husband, she was 
elected to fill his seat as the next Marin Coun-
ty Superintendent, a position she has held for 
seven terms. 
As Superintendent, Mary Jane fulfilled an 
essential role in shaping the trajectory of stu-
dents’ education at a critical age and ensuring 
our schools receive vital funding including 
overseeing 40,000 students and the distribu-
tion of $450 million. Marin County Office of 
Education (MCOE) is responsible for the fiscal 
oversight of Marin County’s 18 school districts 
budgets, and provides a variety of services in-
cluding technology and educational program-
ming for both public and private K–12 schools; 
managing regionalized special education pro-
grams; and offering professional development 
for teachers, instructional assistants, adminis-
trators, and school board trustees; among 
many other services. Mary Jane managed 
these roles with a high degree of commitment, 
always applying the highest standards and a 
laser focus on what is best for children. She 
developed a well-deserved reputation for her 
collaborative leadership style, and ability to 
cultivate strong partnerships among school 
districts, community organizations, businesses, 
and local governments. 
Among her numerous accomplishments is 
the establishment of the Marin County School 
to Career Partnership and SchoolsRule-Marin, 
a joint effort by the county’s public-school 
foundations to raise funds for K–12 students 
countywide to ensure access to critical edu-
cational opportunities is available for all public 
students, regardless of zip code. This program 
continues to combat the county’s equality gap 
more than a decade later. Unafraid to take 
bold stances on deeply rooted and com-
plicated issues, Mary Jane also played an es-
sential role in prompting the state’s 2019 his-
toric desegregation order that resulted in the 
Sausalito Marin City Unified School District. 
She has been a fierce advocate for increasing 
access to early education and preschool. Be-
yond her work with MCOE, she shares her tal-
ent and time on the Board of Directors for the 
Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance 
Team (FCMAT), the Marin County Treasury 
Oversight Committee, and is the former Presi-
dent of the California County Superintendents 
Educational Services Association (CCSESA) 
representing all 58 California County Super-
intendents of Schools. 
Superintendent Burke’s work to improve 
public schools is regarded as a model for 
other counties throughout California. Her ex-
pertise has earned admiration and recognition 
from 
influential 
changemakers 
throughout 
Marin County and the State of California, as 
well as a plethora of awards and honors in-
cluding California Assembly’s 2021 ‘‘State of 
California Woman of the Year’’ for her

Madam Speaker, Mary Jane Burke leaves 
an indelible legacy as she retires and I re-
spectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
immense gratitude to Mary Jane Burke for her 
extraordinary generosity of spirit, unwavering 
commitment, and innumerable contributions to 
improving the quality of life for communities in 
Marin County and California and extending to 
her best wishes on her next endeavors.

HONORING MR. WINDELL CUROLE 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in order to share a story of Cajun 
ingenuity and recognize a man who went be-
yond the call of duty for his community. 
Windell 
Curole, 
Manager 
of 
the 
South 
Lafourche Levee District, fought tooth and nail 
to build a more secure flood protection sys-
tem. Mr. Curole knew the area’s levees 
weren’t high enough to defend against a major 
storm; he began gathering funds and bringing 
in the necessary resources to raise the levees. 
Mr. Curole understands his community and 
gained their support—guided by his leader-
ship, the Parish self-taxed in order to improve 
their own levee system. 
Mr. Curole is no stranger to challenge: the 
U.S. Corps of Engineers issued cease and de-
sist orders, even going so far as to threaten 
him with legal repercussions for lacking the 
correct permits. Driven by a just cause, Mr. 
Curole simply kept building. Mr. Curole’s ef-
forts successfully protected South Lafourche 
from Hurricane Ida, which devastated most of 
the surrounding area. His vision and efforts 
prevented extensive flooding and helped the 
region back on its feet after this terrible storm. 
Come hell, high water, or even legal threats, 
Windell Curole has always and will always 
take appropriate action to defend his commu-
nity. I am proud to call Mr. Curole a fellow 
Louisianian—and friend.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
TOURETTE 
SYNDROME 
AWARE-
NESS MONTH 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of National Tourette Syndrome 
Awareness Month which runs from May 15 
through June 15 each year. As a founder and 
Co-Chair of the Congressional Tourette Syn-
drome Caucus, I want to use this opportunity 
to address the need for additional research 
and, hopefully, clear up some common mis-
conceptions about Tourette syndrome. 
Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuro-
logical disorder that involves tics, which are 
sudden movements and vocalizations or 
noises that people do repeatedly. It develops 
during childhood and changes over time. 
Symptoms can wax and wane across the life-
span of the individual. There is no cure for 
Tourette syndrome, and only three medica-
tions have been approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration, which each have sig-
nificant side effects and contraindications. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), among children diagnosed 
with TS, 83 percent have at least one addi-
tional mental, behavioral, or developmental 
condition. These co-occurring conditions can 
include anxiety, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive dis-
order (OCD), autism, Oppositional Defiance 
Disorder (ODD), depression, learning difficul-
ties, and other conditions. These co-occurring 
conditions can significantly impact the lives of 
those affected by TS. 
Data from the CDC suggests roughly 50 
percent of children and teens with TS are not 
diagnosed. CDC studies including children 
with both diagnosed and undiagnosed TS 
have estimated that one out of every 162 chil-
dren (0.6 percent) have TS. However, these 
numbers do not include children with Chronic 
or Provisional Tic Disorders. It is estimated 
that one out of 100 school-aged children have 
TS or another tic disorder. 
Tourette Syndrome is often misconstrued by 
media and therefore misunderstood by the 
public. Many people believe TS involves ob-
scene language. However, only 10 percent of 
those with TS have coprolalia, the form of TS 
with obscene language. Continued education 
and awareness can help to increase under-
standing and reduce stigma or bullying. 
Neither the full public health impact nor the 
true cost of living with TS is known. Yet, indi-
viduals with TS and their families often face 
substantial costs due to healthcare visits, spe-
cial educational services, medication, psycho-
logical and behavioral counseling, occupa-
tional therapy, missed school and work, and 
more. 
It is for these reasons that the Tourette Syn-
drome Program at the National Center for 
Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities 
remains critically important. Research from 
this program seeks to better understand prev-
alence, co-occurring conditions, impact, and 
costs associated with TS. The Tourette Syn-
drome Program also educates doctors, teach-
ers, allied professionals, parents and the pub-
lic at large so that we can increase the diag-
nosis rate and improve the lives of those living 
with TS. 
I would also like to recognize the Tourette 
Association of America (TAA) which was 
founded in 1972 and is celebrating its 50th 
Anniversary this year. The TAA is the only na-
tional organization serving the TS community 
and works to raise awareness, advance re-
search, and provide ongoing support to pa-
tients and families impacted by TS and Tic 
Disorders. 
Madam Speaker, we must continue working 
to provide additional funding to increase the 
diagnosis rate and achieve a more inclusive 
and enlightened society with a better under-
standing of Tourette Syndrome. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing May 15 
through June 15 as National Tourette Syn-
drome Awareness Month.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 27, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of retired Lieu-
tenant Colonel Michael W.L. Yap as he retires 
from my District’s Service Academy Advisory 
Board (SAAB) after 14 years of steadfast serv-
ice, assisting in the nomination process. I want 
to thank him for his lifelong dedication to his 
country and the cultivation of the next genera-
tion of leaders. 
Michael Yap was born in Honolulu, Hawaii 
during the Second World War and grew up in-
volved in and admired by his community. 
From tennis team captain to valedictorian, he 
was a leader and a role model in everything 
he put his mind to, and he continued that ex-
cellence in his time at West Point. Michael 
was nominated by the late Senator Hiram 
Fong and became the only Chinese-American 
student in his class. He remained an active 
athlete, playing in the Corps Squad for both 
tennis and squash. 
After graduating from West Point, Michael 
was commissioned into the Field Artillery. He 
served one tour in Vietnam and returned to 
the United States to teach nuclear target anal-
ysis. Michael went on to attend Command and 
General Staff College in Leavenworth, Kansas 
and continued to serve as an atomic energy 
expert. He then obtained two Masters of 
Science from the University of Illinois, one in 
Physics and one in Nuclear Engineering. 
Michael Yap has remained an active mem-
ber of the West Point community. First on the 
Association of Graduates Advisory Council, 
and now he currently chairs a task force to 
make alumni events more accessible. Since 
1987, he has coordinated all class events in 
Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Colum-
bia in his role as Class Vice President for the 
Capital Region. Michael facilitates quarterly 
brunches, an annual dinner, and a ceremony 
at the Vietnam Memorial every five years. 
His influence has produced a number of sig-
nificant initiatives for West Point. Michael intro-
duced the Class of 2017 Affiliation Class and 
helped coordinate the Surviving Family Mem-
ber program. His strong ties to the Academy 
have been a vital contribution to my office’s 
annual nomination process these last 14 
years. We have relied on Michael’s thorough 
understanding of the rigor and community that 
make West Point unique in order to elevate 
candidates who will do us proud. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending the extraordinary serv-
ice of retired Lieutenant Colonel Michael Yap 
as he retires from our Service Academy Advi-
sory Board. His contributions have been para-
mount in ensuring the next generation of mili-
tary leaders from Virginia’s 11th District is a 
cut above the rest. And while we wish them 
well, they will have big shoes to fill in match-
ing Michael Yap’s legacy.
