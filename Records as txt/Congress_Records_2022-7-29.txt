PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, it is good and fitting to eat, 
drink, and find enjoyment alongside 
the work with which we labor, and 
recreation in the days You have given 
us. 
So it is on this day that we come to 
You in gratitude for the pleasure re-
ceived not only in the privilege to 
serve You here in this place, but for 
the enjoyment of a good ball game, the 
civil rivalry of peers, and the abundant 
fellowship and support of friends and 
fans. 
Now, having fought the good fight, 
may we finish the week, prolonging the 
collegial spirit found on the field, and 
upholding the shared commitment that 
brings us together for the common 
good. 
Grant comfort to the defeated, hu-
mility to the victors, respite to the 
weary, and wisdom to us all. 
Renewed by Your spirit we offer 
these 
prayers 
in 
Your 
everlasting 
name. 
Amen.

DEMOCRATS ARE LOWERING 
COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate House Democrats’ 
efforts to lower costs for working fami-
lies. Democrats fight for families over 
politics. 
As we know, Putin’s cruel war on 
Ukraine has caused the price of goods 
to increase. Instead of playing politics 
and pointing fingers as extreme MAGA 
Republicans have done, House Demo-
crats have delivered results for the 
American people. 
Democrats simply passed the Lower 
Food and Fuel Costs Act, the Consumer 
Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, 
and the Affordable Insulin Now Act to 
lower the costs of goods, gas, and insu-
lin for all Americans. 
On top of that, yesterday, the House 
passed the CHIPS and Science Act, a 
strong bill that will invest in lowering 
costs for hardworking American fami-
lies and end our country’s dependence 
on foreign producers. 
You see, Madam Speaker, Democrats 
are here to deliver for the American 
people. We are putting people over poli-
tics. 
f 
THE ECONOMY IS SHRINKING 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, the 
economy shrank for the second quarter 
in a row. Americans are now facing a 
recession that was totally avoidable 
but brought on by President Biden and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7410 
July 29, 2022 
Washington Democrats’ Big Govern-
ment spending and war on American 
energy. 
Proving just how out of touch Presi-
dent Biden is, he shrugged off talk of a 
recession and said Americans are just 
facing an economic transition. 
This administration has spent more 
time trying to convince Americans we 
are not in a recession than actually 
working on the problem. 
Americans are hurting right now, 
and as the price of gas and groceries 
continues to rise, Washington Demo-
crats are preparing legislation in Con-
gress that will raise taxes on farmers, 
businesses, and working families. 
The Democrat elite don’t live in the 
real world, and they continue to put 
the priorities of their radical agenda 
over working American families—the 
same people they profess to help. 
Our economy is shrinking, and Big 
Government spending is growing. 
Americans cannot afford Washington 
Democrats’ far-left agenda. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE HIGHLIGHTS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, as the 
summer session comes to a close, and I 
return home to meet with folks from 
Cheltenham to Collegeville, Pottstown 
to Boyertown, and everywhere in be-
tween, I am reflecting on what work we 
have accomplished, work like my fire 
detectors bill that will prevent trage-
dies, like the horrific fire we saw in 
Philadelphia that claimed 12 lives, pro-
tecting people in public housing; or my 
SECURE Notarization Act that will 
make it easier and faster to notarize 
documents for families and military 
personnel abroad. 
Democrats are putting people over 
politics. We passed major protections 
for abortion, contraception, gay mar-
riage, bills to prevent price gouging 
and fight inflation, and the CHIPS and 
Science Act to revitalize American 
manufacturing. 
Next is our reconciliation bill that 
will deliver the largest investment in 
American history to tackle climate 
change, healthcare, drug pricing, and 
so much more. 
Recognizing the humanity of our 
work, we are putting people over 
power. We are putting people over poli-
tics. 
f 
NATIONAL INTERN DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize National Intern Day. Today is a 
day dedicated to recognizing and cele-
brating the future leaders of the world: 
interns. 
National Intern Day has served as an 
opportunity for thousands of employers 
to commemorate and thank their hard-
working interns. 
I will take this time to recognize and 
thank our three current interns who 
join me this summer: Adiya, Ben, and 
Sam. All three have been instrumental 
in helping serve both the people of 
Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional Dis-
trict and the House Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
From conducting research to drafting 
speeches and statements, to guiding 
tours and responding to constituents, 
Adiya, Ben, and Sam were fantastic ad-
ditions to my D.C. office. 
Madam Speaker, our interns today 
are truly the leaders of tomorrow, and 
they deserve recognition for their out-
standing work. 
Thank you to our interns, again, for 
joining us this summer. 
f 
HONORING ZAHRA ABBAS 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, Michi-
gan lost an incredible human being 
yesterday. 
Zahra Abbas was brilliant, compas-
sionate, and full of love for commu-
nity. 
Zahra lived with epilepsy, which she 
learned to control with the use of can-
nabis. This inspired her mission to edu-
cate and advocate for the access of 
healthcare and the use of alternative 
approaches. 
Zahra founded and became the chair 
of the Cannabis Caucus of the Michigan 
Democratic Party. She was also a DNC 
delegate. 
Zahra 
spoke 
passionately 
about 
issues that she believed in at rallies 
and community meetings and meetings 
with other political leaders across 
Michigan and the Nation. She gained 
so much incredible respect from our 
community. 
My team and I are devastated and 
heartbroken. We extend our deepest 
condolences to the Abbas family. Allah 
Yerhama. 
f 
RECOGNIZING GENE ANGLIN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of an incredible public servant, a 
veteran, and a great American: Gene 
Anglin. 
Born in 1924 in Wadley, Georgia, Gene 
was a Georgia native, who served his 
community and was a defender of free-
dom. 
At the onset of World War II, Gene 
felt the call to action but was denied 
entry to the U.S. Army due to color 
blindness. 
Gene went to work for Bell Aircraft 
Corporation building B–29 Superfor-
tress bombers. 
In 1944, Gene successfully enlisted 
and joined the U.S. Army in the heavy 
weapons company of the 100th Infantry 
Division. 
Gene deployed to the European the-
ater where his division experienced 185 
days of uninterrupted combat as they 
journeyed through France and into 
Germany. 
Gene was awarded the Bronze Star 
Medal Combat Infantryman Badge and 
Presidential Unit Citation for heroism 
in battle. 
After the war, Gene attended the 
Georgia Institute of Technology and 
earned a bachelor’s degree in mechan-
ical engineering. 
Gene spent 22 years at Robert and 
Company Association, among other 
firms. He then retired to St. Simons Is-
land in the First Congressional District 
where he worked as a golf course start-
er at Sea Island Golf Club and was an 
active member of St. Simons Pres-
byterian Church and the Rotary Club 
of St. Simons. 
Truly 
an 
example 
of 
America’s 
Greatest Generation, Gene will be dear-
ly missed. 
f 
CONGRATULATING RON WILES ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to honor Grand Blanc Township 
chief of police Ron Wiles as he retires 
after 26 years of service on the police 
force. 
In his quarter century serving Grand 
Blanc Township, Chief Wiles has been 
an incredible champion for community 
policing, bringing law enforcement and 
the community together keeping mid- 
Michigan residents safe from crime. 
Chief Wiles is an important member 
of the Genesee County Advocates and 
Leaders for Police and Community 
Trust, or ALPACT, a forum where com-
munity leaders and law enforcement 
come together to develop public safety 
solutions for crime. 
Chief Wiles is also well-recognized as 
a figure across Michigan law enforce-
ment. Recently, he completed an out-
standing term as president of the 
Michigan Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice. 
Chief Wiles has also served on the 
Governor’s 
Traffic 
Safety 
Advisory 
Commission; and in March, Chief Wiles 
was appointed by Governor Whitmer to 
serve on the Michigan Commission on 
Law Enforcement Standards where he 
will continue working to better the law 
enforcement 
profession 
and 
keep 
Michiganians safe. 
I personally thank Chief Wiles for his 
service to our community, for our work 
together on behalf of mid-Michigan. 
Grand Blanc Township has been blessed 
by his presence, and I congratulate him 
on his retirement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7411 
July 29, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the young 
men of Warwick School District’s base-
ball team. 
The Warwick Warriors baseball beat 
Liberty High to close out a successful 
23–2 season by winning the district’s 
first PIAA 6A State Championship. 
The game, held last month, was im-
pacted by a prolonged weather delay, 
but the warriors held firm to the early 
lead to capture the championship. 
Throughout their dominating season, 
the Warriors also clinched the District 
Three title, as well. 
Madam Speaker, it is no surprise 
that the community is very proud of 
these students for their achievement 
on the baseball diamond. It was great 
to see the local law enforcement and 
volunteer firefighters join with the 
community by participating in a pa-
rade to honor their achievement. 
Congratulations to the members and 
coaches of the Warwick Warrior State 
championship 
baseball 
team. 
The 
whole community is wishing them con-
tinued success. May they carry the les-
sons they learned playing as part of a 
successful team toward their future 
goals.

BRING THE CHIPS INDUSTRY 
HOME 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, the 
CHIPS and Science Act is critical leg-
islation to ramp up American produc-
tion of semiconductor chips. 
Our economy relies on these chips, 
which are key components in every-
thing from cell phones to cars to ad-
vancing national security measures. 
By increasing production here in 
America, we will onshore a critical ca-
pability, reduce dependence on foreign 
manufacturers, and lower costs for 
hardworking families. 
The United States invented the semi-
conductor chip. We used to make 40 
percent of the world’s chips. Now, we 
make 12 percent, leaving key industries 
vulnerable to foreign interference. It is 
high time we counter the threat posed 
by countries like China and Russia and 
bring this industry home. 
The CHIPS and Science Act does just 
that, and this investment helps North 
Carolina chip manufacturers, including 
Qorvo and IQE, major employers in my 
home district, to ramp up production 
and create good-paying jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly cast my 
vote to send the CHIPS Act to the 
President’s desk. I am ready to see this 
legislation work for North Carolinians 
and for the country.

REQUIREMENT 
OF 
CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH 
RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF 
CERTAIN 
RESOLUTIONS 
RE-
PORTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON 
RULES 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1300 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1300 
Resolved, That the requirement of clause 
6(a) of rule XIII for a two-thirds vote to con-
sider a report from the Committee on Rules 
on the same day it is presented to the House

through the legislative day of Friday, Sep-
tember 16, 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), my good friend, pend-
ing which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the Committee on Rules met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1300, 
waiving clause 6(a) of rule XIII requir-
ing a two-thirds vote to consider a rule 
on the same day it is reported from the 
Committee on Rules against any reso-
lution reported through the legislative 
day of July 29, 2022. 
The rule also allows certain legisla-
tion to qualify for the Consensus Cal-
endar before the end of Congress. 
Madam Speaker, we are here on a 
same-day rule, which I hope will give 
us the opportunity to address a critical 
and urgent issue: gun violence in 
America. 
We are here because gun violence is 
destroying communities, tearing apart 
families, and making our streets less 
safe. This majority is going to try to 
do every single thing we possibly can 
to stop it. I don’t know whether we will 
succeed, but we are going to try. 
Democrats actually passed the Safer 
Communities Act, the first piece of 
major gun safety legislation in dec-
ades, and we sent it to President 
Biden’s desk. We are taking action. We 
are getting things done, and we are 
trying to save lives. 
Contrast that with what Republicans 
did to address gun violence and crime 
the last time they were in charge, 
which is absolutely nothing. Their an-
swer to gun violence is more guns, and 
if that is not enough, even more guns. 
For God’s sake, America already has 
more guns than people. How many guns 
do we need until everybody is safe? 
I get it. My Republican friends are 
going to complain about the process. 
They are going to complain about 
same-day authority, even though they 
used it themselves, but let’s not go 
there because we want to have a pro-
ductive debate here. 
The reality is this: This is the last 
day before the district work period, 
and this is urgent work. 
Now, let me tell you, as chairman of 
the House Committee on Rules, I want 
to do whatever I can to get us to vote 
on and pass an assault weapons ban be-
cause I am sick and tired of the mass 
shootings and the terror and the fear. I 
am sick and tired of shattered families 
having to grieve. 
Enough is enough. I am going to do 
everything I can to get this bill passed, 
and I am not going to apologize for 
that. This rule preserves that option. If 
it means that we stay here a little bit 
longer today, so be it. We need to act 
with urgency. 
Let me just say, for the record, the 
assault weapons bill that we may pos-
sibly consider today went through reg-
ular order. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary had a hearing; it was marked up. 
If we decide to bring it to the floor 
today, which I hope we will, the Com-
mittee on Rules will meet, and we will 
debate this, and we will vote on this. 
But let me just say to everybody: We 
have an obligation to act with urgency. 
We have a responsibility to address 
this crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend and 
the distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Rules for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to, for 
the record, say there is nothing before 
us in the rule that has anything to do 
with any kind of assault weapons ban 
or policing. This is simply a rule that 
would waive the 24-hour requirement. 
Look, to be candid, the Democrats 
have now opened the door for Repub-
licans to use this in the future to push

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7412 
July 29, 2022 
forward our agenda, which is going to 
protect the rights and liberties of indi-
vidual people. 
I would like to take this time to 
point out the hypocrisy and the irony I 
see coming from across the aisle. Let 
me just talk about that. 
Madam Speaker, 9 days is all it took 
before the Speaker reinstated her au-
thoritarian COVID lockdown, proving 
once again that House Democrats are 
unable to govern unless they stack the 
deck. I would also remind my good 
friend that he consistently referred to 
these tactics as ‘‘martial law’’ during 
his time in the minority. 
If I can just quote the chair on same- 
day authority during the 109th Con-
gress: ‘‘My problem is with significant 
pieces of legislation, some legislation 
which may not have even been heard 
by committees of jurisdiction, which 
may not have been reported out of 
committees of jurisdiction, bills that 
will come before us that the House has 
never even considered, things that we 
will not have an opportunity to be able 
to read before we vote on them.’’ 
That was in the 109th Congress. 
Where is the outrage now? 
Madam Speaker, for over 790 days, 
the Speaker used COVID–19 as a weap-
on to deny the Republicans the ability 
to advocate on behalf of millions of 
Americans that they represent. Just 
last week, it looked like we were fi-
nally returning to regular order. Now, 
it is more of the same tricks and tac-
tics. 
The blanket same-day rule before us 
this morning allows House Democrats 
to ram through their radical agenda, 
an agenda that does nothing to address 
the serious problems the American peo-
ple are facing. 
What are those problems? Under the 
Biden administration, our Nation has 
careened from one crisis to the next. It 
has been absolute chaos. 
Right now, families across the coun-
try are facing 40-year high inflation 
that is expected to cost the average 
American household an extra $6,000 a 
year. Yesterday, we were told that we 
are officially in a recession when the 
GDP fell for a second quarter in a row. 
Although the Biden administration is 
attempting to deflect blame by refer-
ring to this latest economic disaster as 
a ‘‘transition period,’’ the American 
people know that we are in a recession 
and facing hard times to come because 
of the radical policies of the left. 
It is only going to get worse with the 
recently announced build back broke 
deal, which will raise taxes on Ameri-
cans. It will try to socialize American 
healthcare, and it will try to imple-
ment the radical Green New Deal poli-
cies that have led to this energy crisis 
in the first place. 
Madam Speaker, this is no way to 
run the people’s House, but I want it 
noted that the door is now open. I find 
it absolutely hypocritical that there 
was outrage against us when Repub-
licans used the same tactic but now it 
is okay when the Democrats want to do 
it. I am looking forward to the day 
when power returns to the Repub-
licans, and we will see if there is out-
rage at that point. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman used 
the words that we are opening the door. 
Opening the door to what? My friends 
used this all the time when they were 
in charge. We learned this from you. I 
just want to say that, for the record. 
As I have said, I am not the biggest 
fan of same-day authority, but it exists 
for a reason. 
In December 2018, when the Demo-
crats were in the minority, I actually 
voted for a rule providing for same-day 
authority. I stood here and urged my 
Democrat colleagues to support the 
rule. More Republicans voted ‘‘no’’ on 
that rule than Democrats, believe it or 
not. 
Madam Speaker, we are about to 
break for a, hopefully, productive dis-
trict work period, and this rule pro-
vides us with a little extra time and 
flexibility to be able to consider meas-
ures that are critical to our public 
safety. 
I hope that this rule paves the way 
for us to bring up an assault weapons 
ban. That is what I hope this rule does, 
and I think that is urgent. I want to do 
everything I possibly can to get that 
bill to the floor and get it passed. 
The gentleman quoted me, and let me 
quote me, too. With regard to the 
same-day authority, I said on the 
House floor: ‘‘This House needs to 
move quickly and responsibly. Every-
one understands that, so I will simply 
say that I will be voting for this rule. 
I urge my colleagues to do the same, so 
we can finish our business and prevent 
another government shutdown.’’ 
That was when you were in charge. 
That was what I said in response to 
when you brought up a same-day rule. 
So, nobody is opening the door. You 
opened that door a long time ago. But 
I am going to say, again, if this paves 
the way for us to be able to bring up an 
assault weapons ban, I am not apolo-
gizing at all. I want to get that legisla-
tion to the floor. I want to have that 
debate. I want to have a vote on it. 
People are dying all over this coun-
try. They are sick of our inaction. It is 
time to act. Enough is enough. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad the gen-
tleman also quoted himself. You can 
tell how I am handling this debate be-
cause I don’t want to be quoted in the 
future when the shoe is on the other 
foot. But I will point out the hypocrisy 
from my friends on the other side of 
the aisle that their outrage is obvi-
ously selective of who is waiving the 
rule and who is not. 
Look, we can talk about procedure 
all day here. That is not going to fix 
the real problems that are facing the 
American people. According to the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
ness, inflation is the top problem re-
ported by businesses. This is the high-
est inflation we have had since 1980, lit-
erally the highest inflation in my life-
time. 
Instead of working to lower costs for 
businesses and workers, the SEC pro-
posed burdensome new rules requiring 
businesses to disclose extensive cli-
mate-related data and additional ‘‘cli-
mate risks.’’ 
Setting climate policy is the respon-
sibility of Congress, not unelected ca-
reer bureaucrats who are absolutely 
unaccountable to the American people. 
That is why, if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule to immediately 
consider H.R. 8589 that would prohibit 
the SEC’s woke climate rule from mov-
ing forward. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD
along 
with any extraneous material imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, here to explain my amend-
ment is my good friend, a senior mem-
ber of the House Committee on Finan-
cial Services and the sponsor of this 
bill, Congressman FRENCH HILL of Ar-
kansas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 8589 
to prohibit the Securities and Ex-
change Commission from finalizing, 
implementing, or enforcing its pro-
posed climate rule. 
Now, Madam Speaker, it is the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission. It is 
not the securities and environment 
commission. 
Last night, we had the pleasure of 
playing baseball. I am glad to see my 
colleagues up early this morning to be 
on the House floor. It was a great 
game. I was proud to see the right 
team won, but we are once again back 
on the floor talking between Repub-
licans 
and 
Democrats, 
Republicans 
being the party for growth, oppor-
tunity, and liberty, and the House ma-
jority, the Democrats, doubling down, 
Madam Speaker, on dumb in the midst 
of inflation, runaway spending, failed 
energy policy, and open borders.

Today, as the winds of recession and 
stagflation blow, House Democrats are 
here to talk about higher taxes and 
higher crippling regulations on job cre-
ators. There is no evidence that there

is any lack of knowledge in public com-
panies that they have an obligation 
under the existing securities laws to 
disclose material impact from any-
thing to do with climate change, and 
there is zero evidence that they are un-
aware of climate change and are not 
talking about it on a regular basis with 
their shareholders, their boards, and 
their employees. 
Now, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission has three mandates: inves-
tor protection, maintaining orderly 
markets, and capital formation. But 
rather than focus on those three mis-
sions, Gary Gensler, the chairman of 
the SEC, is typical of this administra-
tion: a Big Government, nanny state 
supervisor who is going beyond his 
statutory authority and delving in and 
trying to become, as I argue, a climate 
czar. 
His proposal has been met with sig-
nificant substantive rejection. Ninety- 
one advocacy groups just last week, in-
cluding the Farm Bureau, community 
bankers in every State of the country, 
and the Job Creators Network wrote 
the Small Business Committee chair-
man and ranking member their opposi-
tion to this proposal, and that it should 
be withdrawn. 
Alfredo Ortiz, the president of Job 
Creators Network, said: 
The SEC’s proposed rule would be an un-
necessary and costly burden on America’s 
small businesses, at a time when we are deal-
ing with ‘‘Bideninflation’’, higher interest 
rates, and a supply chain crisis. 
Now, Madam Speaker, Gary Gensler, 
the chairman, argues that this pro-
posal is the right thing to do. We argue 
it is not, that it shouldn’t be imple-
mented, and we shouldn’t spend any 
money there to do it. 
Let me tell you what Nasdaq, the Na-
tional Association of Securities Deal-
ers—the market system for the growth 
of our country—wrote Gary Gensler. 
Now, these people are not anti-climate. 
They are not climate deniers. They run 
the Nasdaq marketplace. 
They wrote: 
The proposal creates additional disclosure 
obligations outside of existing frameworks. 
The proposed timeline for reporting is unrea-
sonable. Prescriptive disclosures are too 
costly. 
The Commission itself says this will 
triple the cost to be a public company. 
Huh? Triple the cost to be a public 
company? 
We don’t have enough public compa-
nies as there are. 
The materiality standards deviate from 
the law. The prescriptive disclosures do not 
facilitate meaningful comparisons. The pre-
scriptive disclosures create disincentives for 
companies. And they say that scope 3 green-
house gas emissions disclosure requirements 
could harm small private suppliers. Finally, 
they say that the proposal’s timing and 
scope could harm the initial public offering 
market. 
This is an economy that has half the 
public companies we had in 1980, and 
this administration and their SEC 
want to make that even worse and 
more costly. 
Let me remind you, the Commission 
itself tripled the cost to be a public 
company. 
Madam Speaker, we have people who 
are private companies now because 
they cannot afford to be public. And if 
we don’t have public companies, then 
we don’t have investments in labor 
union pension plans, we don’t have op-
portunities for investment in our 401(k) 
plans, we hurt this economy, and we 
hurt job creators if this proposal is im-
plemented. 
So it is very easy for me to stand 
here and argue against it. 
Finally, I would say that this is part 
of a longstanding practice of this ad-
ministration to use every tool they 
have in the regulatory space to do 
something that is the prerogative, as 
my good friend from Pennsylvania 
said, of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I want to 
reiterate this point. This is the respon-
sibility of Congress if we are going to 
set environment and energy regulatory 
policy. It is not the purpose of our 
independent regulatory commissions. 
Aren’t we clear now that the Su-
preme Court agrees with that position? 
Just in the last few days they ruled 
in a case called West Virginia v. EPA 
which basically says: hey, independent 
regulatory agencies, stay in your lane. 
Stay in your lane. Listen to what Con-
gress has written in the statute. And 
Congress has not written this in a stat-
ute, which is why the SEC is way out of 
line with this proposal, while the 
Nasdaq market system rejects it, while 
small businesses reject it, while public 
company CEOs reject it, and why the 
Farm Bureau rejects it. 
As I say, this administration came to 
power with an idea that this was their 
number one issue, and you can tell it 
because the people who worked on the 
task force to propose this rule are the 
Chief of Staff at the Treasury Depart-
ment, the head of the National Eco-
nomic Council, and the White House 
staff. All came to Congress with an 
idea to propose this rule. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
Republicans’ efforts to not see this rule 
implemented and to not fund it. I 
thank my friend from Pennsylvania for 
yielding to me. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say that 
I think as everybody knows, Democrats 
are focused on inflation. Tackling in-
flation is certainly our top priority. 
Let’s take a look at the facts. 
We passed the Lower Food and Fuel 
Costs Act to bring down costs to fami-
lies, and almost every Republican 
voted no. 
We passed the Consumer Fuel Price 
Gouging Prevention Act, but not a sin-
gle Republican voted with us. 
What is the Republican solution on 
inflation? 
Who the hell knows? 
They haven’t offered any policy 
ideas. They seem content cheering for 
President Biden to fail and for infla-
tion to go up. In fact, Leader MCCON-
NELL is holding hostage a bill to lower 
costs for families and to deal with the 
issue of prescription drugs. 
The only plan I have seen from the 
GOP is from Senator RICK SCOTT, Re-
publican, which would raise taxes on 
the middle class—raise taxes on the 
middle class—and put Social Security 
and Medicare on the chopping block. 
That is the same old same old from 
my friends on the other side. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an MSNBC opinion article ti-
tled: ‘‘The GOP keeps slamming Biden 
over inflation, but it has no solutions 
to offer.’’ 
[From MSNBC, June 21, 2022] 
THE GOP KEEPS SLAMMING BIDEN OVER IN-
FLATION, BUT
IT
HAS
NO
SOLUTIONS
TO 
OFFER 
(By Dean Obeidallah) 
Republicans want you to believe that infla-
tion in the United States is not part of a 
global problem but is 100 percent, President 
Joe Biden’s fault. 
Just check out their recent over-the-top 
rhetoric. 
House 
Minority 
Leader 
Kevin 
McCarthy, R–Calif., has blamed Biden for 
‘‘creating raging inflation.’’ In a tweet, Sen. 
Ted 
Cruz, 
R–Texas, 
called 
inflation 
‘‘#BidenFlation,’’ saying it was caused by 
Biden’s policies. Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell, R–Ky., even made a speech 
on the Senate floor last week focused on in-
flation, in which he detailed the rising prices 
of goods, gas, etc., all leading to the cre-
scendo that it was Biden and the Democrats’ 
fault. 
What the GOP has left out of all its speech-
es, television appearances and tweets slam-
ming Biden is even a hint of a proposal to re-
duce prices. 
But what the GOP has left out of all its 
speeches, television appearances and tweets 
slamming Biden is even a hint of a proposal 
to reduce prices. Even worse than the GOP 
not having a plan of its own, though, is Re-
publicans’ determination to block Biden’s ef-
forts to help Americans. They’ve opposed his 
agenda to lower child care costs, create af-
fordable housing and more. Biden made that 
very point in his June 14 speech about his 
plans to address inflation, in which he de-
clared that ‘‘Republicans in Congress are 
doing everything they can to stop my plans 
to bring down costs on ordinary families.’’ 
There’s no disputing that prices in our na-
tion rose 8.6 percent in May since last year 
at that time, the highest rate since 1981. 
Food prices have risen over 10 percent since 
May 2021, and gas prices have skyrocketed. 
Just about everything we use on a daily 
basis costs more. 
Biden candidly acknowledged this reality 
in last week’s speech, noting that inflation is 
‘‘sapping the strength of a lot of families.’’ 
He said he understands firsthand what this is 
like, noting that when he was a child grow-
ing up in a blue-collar family, ‘‘it mattered 
if the price of food went up.’’ 
A convergence of issues has caused this 
spike in inflation. The well-documented sup-
ply chain issues that followed Covid shut-
downs drove up prices. Some of it was fueled 
by us, consumers who unleashed our pent-up 
demand to travel and buy goods after things 
reopened. More demand equals higher prices.

July 29, 2022 
Russia’s attack on Ukraine added to higher 
gas prices, which contribute to higher prices 
for goods, since it costs more to transport 
them. 
This is in no way a Biden-caused problem— 
unless Republicans are telling us he caused 
inflation worldwide, which they very well 
might say before November. A Pew Research 
Center report released just last week docu-
mented that in 37 of the 44 nations with ‘‘ad-
vanced economies,’’ the ‘‘average annual in-
flation rate in the first quarter of this year 
was at least twice what it was in the first 
quarter of 2020.’’ In fact, the United States 
during the first quarter of this year was 13 of 
44 in terms of inflation, far eclipsed by coun-
tries such as Italy, Israel, Spain, Greece and 
Turkey. 
This leads us to the hard reality that 
there’s no easy solution for inflation; if there 
were, Biden would’ve flipped that switch 
months ago. And cynical Republicans know 
that. 
At least Biden does have a plan, which, 
like the causes of inflation, is multifaceted. 
With respect to gas prices, in addition to 
releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve to increase supplies, the president 
last week sent a letter to U.S. oil companies 
demanding that they increase the production 
of oil and to stop unfairly profiting on Amer-
icans’ need for gas. He even threatened to 
‘‘use all reasonable and appropriate Federal 
Government tools and emergency authorities 
to increase refinery capacity and output in 
the near term.’’ In his speech last week, 
Biden noted that on food costs, he was 
‘‘working closely with our European part-
ners to get 20 million tons of grains locked in 
Ukraine out onto the market to help bring 
down food prices.’’ The president also ex-
plained his efforts to reduce other household 
costs to offset the higher gas and food prices, 
such as capping the cost of insulin at $35—a 
bill for which passed the House in March but 
still has not passed the Senate due to lack of 
Republican support. 
So where is the GOP plan to address infla-
tion? Republicans have had plenty of time to 
come up with one, given that they have been 
screaming since last summer that Biden 
caused inflation. 
Here’s the best I can find: In May, Sen. 
Rick Scott, R–Fla., the chair of the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee, laid out 
his plan. ‘‘The most effective thing Joe 
Biden can do to solve the inflation crisis he 
created is resign,’’ Scott said. Then there’s 
McCarthy, who earlier this month offered 
the following proposal as his ‘‘solution’’ to 
rising costs: ‘‘I call on Speaker Pelosi and 
House Democrats to hold a prime-time hear-
ing on the out-of-control inflation their poli-
cies have created.’’ 
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R–N.Y., the third- 
ranking member of the House GOP, isn’t 
even pretending her party has a plan. She re-
cently said of inflation, ‘‘House Republicans 
will address these crises when we earn back 
control of the House this November.’’ Sure, 
America, let’s trust the party of tax cuts for 
the wealthy to look out for the rest of us. 
We all get how politics works. The party 
out of power blames the party in power for 
everything that’s bad. But in this case, infla-
tion is directly impacting the lives of all 
Americans. It’s time Democrats and the 
media press every Republican who blames 
Biden for inflation to answer this simple 
question: What is the GOP plan to reduce it? 
Americans deserve an answer. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
since my friends want to change the 
subject, let’s change the subject. 
Republicans right now, as we are 
meeting here, over in the Senate are 
trying to kill the PACT Act, a bill to 
guarantee healthcare to veterans with 
service-related cancers. This is a bill 
that passed the Senate originally 84–14, 
and it passed the House with a major-
ity vote of 342. Many of my Republican 
colleagues supported that. I appreciate 
that. But now Republicans are trying 
to kill it and play politics with it over 
in the Senate. They are putting poli-
tics ahead of people when, in fact, we 
should be putting people ahead of poli-
tics. 
So while we are here having this con-
versation, I would urge my Republican 
friends to pick up the phone and call 
your counterparts in the Senate and 
say: Get out of the way and do what is 
right for our veterans. 
My office is getting calls from vet-
erans who were exposed to burn pits 
when they were overseas. I am sure my 
Republican friends are getting calls in 
their offices. You don’t have to agree 
on everything, but I thought we all 
agreed on this. 
Can we please tell MITCH MCCONNELL 
and tell the Republicans to get out of 
the way and allow this bill to go for-
ward? 
That might be a good use of time 
right now while we are having this con-
versation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), 
who is a member of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman yielding time 
and his leadership on this. 
Madam Speaker, every day capital 
markets are under attack here with 
this Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion. 
The climate disclosure rule, which 
was released in March of this year to-
tals over 500 pages—over 500 pages—and 
includes over 1,000 technical footnotes. 
And oh, by the way, the SEC initially 
gave everybody 30 days to comment on 
that—30 days. Now, you can’t even get 
through the analysis of the original 500 
pages much less the 1,000 technical 
footnotes on that within those 30 days. 
But in reality the SEC doesn’t really 
know what this far-reaching rule will 
cost small, independent, and nonpublic 
businesses across our country. 
In fact, very deep in the summary of 
the rule the SEC admits: 
In many cases, we are unable to reliably 
quantify the potential benefits and costs of 
the rule and, therefore, we encourage com-
menters to provide us with relevant data or 
empirical evidence that would allow us to do 
so. 
Let that sink in: We have no idea 
what the impact is, so why don’t you 
just give us some data to help us work 
through this? Now, I remind you, this 
is not a study, and this is not research. 
This is a finalized proposed rule that 
the SEC is trying to jam through in 30 
days. 
Oh, but they expanded that now, so 
thank you very much. Now, there are 
three basic rules on real estate. 
What is the most important part 
about real estate? 
Location, location, location. 
Well, for the SEC it should be materi-
ality, materiality, materiality. 
How is this information material to a 
publicly traded company and to the in-
vestors who are investing and putting 
their hard-earned money into those 
companies. 
So materiality, materiality, materi-
ality should be the battle cry. But it is 
not with this SEC. 
In fact, in recent months, the Com-
mission has put forth a huge volume of 
additional 
proposals. 
At 
times 
it 
doesn’t appear to be fully informed 
about 
the 
likely 
economic 
con-
sequences of the proposed rules and 
that 
display 
significant 
misunder-
standings of the activity the Commis-
sion seeks to regulate. So without 
proper economic analysis, mistakes 
and unintended consequences are going 
to be inevitable. 
Madam Speaker, since late last year, 
the SEC has embarked on a remarkable 
rulemaking agenda. In the 14 months 
since he was sworn into office, Chair 
Gensler has charted a path for the SEC 
unlike it has seen in its 88-year his-
tory. To be charitable, he is pushing 
the envelope. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. To be charitable, 
this aggressive stance of the chair is 
unprecedented. The reality is they 
can’t get their agenda done through 
the legislative process, so they are just 
going to regulate it. So the SEC is 
going to continue to push the bound-
aries of the statutory authority Con-
gress has given them. 
Unfortunately, instead of protecting 
investors, maintaining fair, orderly, 
and efficient markets, and facilitating 
capital formation—that is part of their 
three-part directive, facilitating cap-
ital formation—they are actually going 
to regulate small, privately held com-
panies in your district right out of 
business. 
So Congress did not establish the 
SEC to set climate policy nor for it to 
be the final arbiter of businesses’ strat-
egies to combat climate change. In her 
recent dissent over the proposed rule, 
Commissioner Hester Peirce rightfully 
noted that the SEC is not the securi-
ties and environment commission. 
My colleagues and I have grave con-
cerns that this rule will set a precedent 
that will allow regulators to expand 
their authorities far beyond the bounds 
of the law. In fact, we have seen some 
recent Supreme Court cases about that 
with the EPA. The proposed climate 
rule shifts the SEC’s rulemaking au-
thority—to be charitable—taking a 
novel, activist approach to climate pol-
icy. 
What is next? 
All of it. Frankly, that is what is on 
his agenda: all of it. They want all of

it. That is their idea of how this econ-
omy ought to be running, not how to 
protect investors, not how to facilitate 
efficient markets, and certainly not 
how to build capital. That is not the 
job of the SEC that has been proposed 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support Mr. HILL’s resolu-
tion and restore sanity to the rule-
making process. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say that 
I really enjoyed listening to my friends 
on the other side of the aisle. They are 
opposed to this rule because the proc-
ess will expedite progress on behalf of 
the American people. Yet they are not 
outraged over using process to block 
progress for the American people. 
Again, since we are changing the sub-
ject, I didn’t hear anything about the 
veterans who right now are desperately 
pleading with Republicans in the Sen-
ate to pass the PACT Act. The gen-
tleman even got extra time and didn’t 
mention that at all. 
Again, I would urge my Republicans, 
as we are still here today, before you 
leave, call Senate Minority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL, call your Repub-
lican counterparts in the Senate, and 
say: please pass the PACT Act. Please 
do that now. 
Our veterans who are suffering from 
cancer as a result of their service and 
being exposed to burn pits are des-
perately pleading with my Republican 
friends to stop blocking it. 
Do you want to be outraged about 
something today? 
Be outraged about that. 
So, again, I would urge that they do 
something. 
Many of my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side supported the PACT Act 
when it came before the House. 
b 0945 
A majority of Republicans in the 
Senate voted to support it; but now 
they are putting politics ahead of peo-
ple. It should be reversed. Put people 
ahead of politics. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members to direct 
their comments to the Chair. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I just want the RECORD to reflect 
that I am not outraged about this rule. 
I just was simply, at the beginning of 
my remarks, my opening statement, 
pointing out the hypocrisy from my 
friends across the other side of the 
aisle who had this selective outrage 
when we waived the 24-hour require-
ment. But it is okay when they do it. 
And again, I am almost gleefully 
looking forward to the opportunity 
when we are in the majority for myself 
to help the then Chairman COLE of the 
Rules Committee do the same thing; 
and we will see what kind of hypocrisy 
comes from the other side of the aisle 
and how they will then have outrage 
when we do it. 
But I am not outraged about this. I 
think that if we are going to move for-
ward today, we should defeat the pre-
vious question. That is what I am pas-
sionate about, and that is what my 
friends that have spoken here today 
are passionate about, because they 
want to run a bill, authored by my 
good friend from Arkansas, that would 
actually help the economic crisis; that 
would actually help fight inflation. 
So, please don’t confuse passion for 
helping the American people out of this 
financial problem with outrage. There 
is no outrage on this side of the aisle. 
But to explain more, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. STEIL), my good friend, and a ris-
ing star of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so we can 
immediately consider H.R. 8589. 
We heard earlier our friends across 
the aisle say that understand this rule, 
which they could pretty much bring up 
any bill they so desire, they are going 
to address inflation. 
Well, count me excited that my col-
leagues across the aisle are finally 
ready to address inflation; inflation 
brought upon all Americans by the 
reckless policies of Democratic one- 
party control; reckless policies of— 
starting—this administration by spend-
ing $1.9 trillion; reckless policies by re-
fusing to unleash American energy. 
And Americans are paying the price for 
the reckless policies of Democrats here 
in Washington. 
It is early in the morning. People are 
making their way here, up to the 
House floor, following a great victory 
by my Republicans in the Congres-
sional baseball game last night—10–0, I 
may note. 
But what is really playing out across 
America right now is people can’t af-
ford the things that their family needs. 
I was speaking to a woman the other 
day in south Milwaukee at a gas sta-
tion, and I asked her how much it costs 
her to now fill up her car with gas. And 
she looked at me and she said, Bryan, 
I don’t know because I have 40 bucks, 
and 40 bucks doesn’t fill up my tank 
with gas. 
I spoke to another woman who said, 
Bryan, I can’t take my daughter out to 
dinner on Friday night for pizza be-
cause I can’t afford it because costs 
keep going up. 
Americans are suffering from run-
away inflation from the reckless poli-
cies from one-party Democratic con-
trol. We have an open rule. The Demo-
crats could bring up any bill today. 
They could bring up any bill. 
Americans 
are 
getting 
clobbered, 
clobbered with runaway inflation; en-
ergy costs going through the roof. This 
woman in South Milwaukee can’t af-
ford to fill up her car with gas. 
And what will we see in the bills 
brought up today? They will intend to 
distract, to change the subject. They 
want to talk about bills that already 
passed the House. They want to talk 
about bills that have nothing to do 
with inflation because they don’t care 
about the woman in South Milwaukee 
who can’t afford to fill up her car with 
gas. They don’t care about the woman 
who can’t afford to take her kids out to 
pizza on Friday nights. 
And count me as darn surprised if we 
see legislation brought by the Demo-
cratic majority today that addresses 
the inflation crisis; that addresses the 
energy crisis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, they are 
going to send everybody in this institu-
tion home for more than a month with 
runaway inflation; interest rates going 
up so people can’t afford to buy a 
house; an energy policy that refuses to 
unleash American energy so that this 
woman in South Milwaukee can’t af-
ford to fill up her car. 
Republicans have answers to the 
challenges of the day. And I thank my 
colleague 
from 
Arkansas 
for 
his 
thoughtful bill that would be brought 
up if we defeat this previous question; 
that would actually put a check on the 
runaway bureaucratic process that we 
see. This one attacks the runaway 
process at the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, that should properly be 
named securities and environmental 
commission. 
And my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle, Madam Speaker, really 
like renaming things, so I suggest, 
while we redefine recession, we throw 
in redefining the SEC today. 
People are getting clobbered. The bill 
by my colleague from Arkansas is a 
pretty thoughtful approach. It says, 
hey, instead of all this additional regu-
lation, these costs that get passed on 
to consumers at the end of the day, 
maybe what we do is we focus on get-
ting 
some 
economic 
growth 
back; 
bringing inflation down. 
And so count me as excited if, under 
this rule—and again, the Democrats 
could bring any bill to the floor on the 
last day. Is that bill going to be some-
thing that substantively and meaning-
fully addresses inflation, addresses en-
ergy costs? Or are they going to bring 
up another topic to distract the Amer-
ican people from the crisis that is play-
ing out across our country? 
Count me as shocked if we see a bill 
that addresses inflation today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
So, Madam Speaker, I don’t know 
who that guy who was yelling is, but I 
would refer him to my earlier com-
ments on all the things that we are 
doing to combat inflation and the stuff 
that we will be rolling out in the days 
ahead. 
But I would urge my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to go over to

the Senate and yell at MITCH MCCON-
NELL so that we can help our veterans. 
I mean, it is unconscionable that, as we 
are gathering here right now, Repub-
licans in the Senate are blocking a bill 
to provide care for veterans exposed to 
burn pits who have cancer. 
I mean, what is going on here? I 
mean, people who are responsible for 
that are unfit to serve in the United 
States Congress, quite frankly. 
Do you want to be outraged about 
something? Be outraged about that at 
this moment. And we also should be 
outraged at the alarming rate of gun 
violence in this country. And my hope 
is that this same-day rule will pave the 
way for the Rules Committee to meet 
and to bring forward a ban on assault 
weapons so we can save lives in this 
country. So that is what this is all 
about today. 
But, again, with all of the yelling and 
screaming, please go over to the other 
Chamber and yell and scream at them 
because right now a lot of our veterans 
are concerned that they will succeed in 
killing a bill that will provide them 
healthcare that they desperately need. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it is quite remark-
able that the gentleman is now telling 
us that this is about gun-related bills, 
because 14 hours ago we had questions 
in the Rules Committee. Those ques-
tions went unasked because the minor-
ity is unsure. 
You know who was unsure when they 
were in the minority? My good friend. 
Let me quote him again. When the Re-
publicans tried to waive the 24-hour re-
quirement, my good friend said: ‘‘Once 
again, we are here on the floor debat-
ing a martial law rule that also makes 
the suspension day. Here we are, once 
again, unsure of what we will be con-
sidering today, tonight, or tomorrow.’’ 
So last night, at 7 P.M., my good 
friend, ranking member of the Rules 
Committee, Mr. COLE, asked a series of 
questions because we wanted to get 
some light shed on it. He asked, what 
would this rule specifically be used for? 
The majority said they didn’t know. 
They were unsure. 
He asked if this were to be related to 
gun-related bills, and if those bills 
would be changed. The majority said 
they didn’t know. We are unsure here. 
He asked if this authority would be 
used for other bills. The majority said 
they didn’t know. 
He asked if the House would be in 
session this weekend, and also the re-
sponse was, the majority didn’t know. 
So it’s amazing how the majority is, 
today, so confident on what is being 
run today through this rule when, just 
14 hours ago, when we asked those 
questions, those answers were not pro-
vided to the minority. 
But here to talk more about the reso-
lution that I will personally offer if we 
defeat the previous question is my good 
friend. I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, listening 
to the other side, and listening to my 
friend from Pennsylvania, I hear a lot 
about uncertainty; that we are not sure 
what we are here for; we are not sure 
what we are going to bring up on the 
House floor. 
Well, I will tell you what: We are cer-
tain that inflation is hurting American 
families. We are certain that people 
don’t know how to fill up their car; 
what that is going to cost; what they 
are going to sacrifice; moving from 
beef to chicken; working on prescrip-
tions this week, maybe gas next week. 
So we are certain the American people 
have inflation, top concern. 
This bill proposed today will help at-
tack inflation by reducing the costs 
that will be imposed by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission in this act. 
And I will read, Madam Speaker, 
from the Task Force on Climate-Re-
lated 
Financial 
Disclosures, 
the 
Bloomberg Commission, and it says: 
All these efforts must be cost-effective, 
reliable. They must be comparable 
across 
countries, 
across 
industries, 
within industries. And the proposal of 
SEC does not do that. 
So I hope that we will be successful 
in H.R. 8589, which will save the gov-
ernment money. And if we are looking 
for bills to bring up, I say to my friend 
from Pennsylvania, I recommend H.R. 
7209, which is the Price Stability Act, 
which will focus the Federal Reserve 
solely on fighting inflation; not fight-
ing climate change; not fighting socio-
economic disparities, focused on infla-
tion because inflation is a thief. That 
is what we should be on this floor de-
bating. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
So, Madam Speaker, the gentleman 
who just spoke was yielded time again, 
and again, didn’t say anything about 
the veterans who are getting screwed 
by Senate Republicans right now in the 
other Chamber. 
Right now, we should take our out-
rage and we should demand that Re-
publicans get out of the way. 
And, by the way, to my friend from 
Pennsylvania, I just went back and I 
read the transcript of what our ex-
change was in the Rules Committee, 
and I think I was pretty clear. 
When I am looking at the transcript, 
I was asked last night, you know, why 
we needed this authority, and I said it 
was to consider public safety bills. 
I was further asked if we would use it 
to consider gun legislation, and I said, 
yes, potentially. 
Now, I don’t know whether it is my 
Massachusetts accent or what, but I 
think I was pretty clear about what we 
were going to bring to the floor today. 
And, again, I hope that we will follow 
through with what I said yesterday. 
So this idea that, oh, I didn’t know— 
and by the way, there are times, as I 
said at the opening, when same-day au-
thority is, to me, necessary. There are 
other times when it is not. And when 
the Republicans were in charge and 
they used it for frivolous things, yeah, 
I objected to it. But when they used it 
in an attempt to try to keep govern-
ment open, I favored it. 
So I don’t know what the gentleman 
is talking about, hypocrisy. I mean, I 
have been in favor of it when I was in 
the minority, and I have been opposed 
to it when I was in the minority. So it 
all depends on the circumstances. 
I think maybe my Republican friends 
have trouble with nuance and trying to 
understand the complexities of the sys-
tem here. But I am totally comfortable 
with my position, past, and present. 
And by the way, if this same-day au-
thority means that we can bring up an 
assault weapons ban, I don’t apologize 
to anybody. I don’t apologize to any-
body. I think it is the right thing to do. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1000 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I want to again say we asked a litany 
of questions to try to give the minority 
guidance on what bills would be consid-
ered today, the context of those bills, 
the timing of those bills, whether we 
would be here this weekend. The re-
sponse constantly was either: I hope 
not; I am unsure; I don’t know. So, 
here we are, in the dark. 
But for the purpose of a rebuttal, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), 
my good friend. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I really 
don’t understand this debate, talking 
about the PACT Act, my friend from 
Massachusetts. That has passed the 
House. Let the Senate do its work. 
We supported it here. Let’s be serious 
here. I voted for the bill. The Senate is 
working out some concern they had. 
They changed the bill. They made the 
bill that is controversial over there. 
Let them figure it out. 
In the Senate, they don’t even know 
that revenue bills originate in the 
House. It was blue-slipped. They don’t 
really know what they are doing over 
in the upper Chamber. 
We know we have the advantage over 
them on that, but what we are talking 
about today are bills being considered 
today. The Speaker is leaving on some 
foreign trip tonight, so we are rushing 
around. We don’t know why we are here 
today, and the people deserve to know 
in advance what we are voting on so we 
can prepare our arguments. 
So, it is not about some bill over in 
the Senate. It is about what bills will 
be on the floor of the House today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The gentleman said we should let the 
Senate do its work. Exactly. The Sen-
ate Republicans are blocking the Sen-
ate from doing its work. What do my 
friends not understand?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7417 
July 29, 2022 
Veterans with cancer are depending 
on Republicans to get out of the way so 
they can get the care that they, quite 
frankly, are entitled to, that they de-
serve. 
It passed overwhelmingly originally 
in the Senate. It passed overwhelm-
ingly in the House. But Senate Repub-
licans are playing politics with the 
lives of our veterans. 
I am outraged by that. Maybe my 
friends on the other side are not, but 
we ought to be demanding that they 
move immediately. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to quote my 
good friend, the chairman, again, this 
time from 2017, when he stated that 
martial law allows the majority to 
‘‘rush their bill with its brand-new 
backroom deals to the floor today 
without any proper deliberation.’’ 
I think that pretty much sums up 
perfectly what we are doing here today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t think it is 
appropriate for my Republican friends 
to lecture us on hypocrisy. The last 
time the Republicans were in charge of 
this place, they ran it into the ground. 
When Republicans were in charge, 
they broke the record for the most 
closed Congress in the history of the 
United States of America. 
When Republicans were in charge and 
our country was on the brink of a shut-
down, the Rules Committee, under Re-
publican control, held an emergency 
meeting. Do you know what that emer-
gency meeting was on? Not on emer-
gency funding but on cheese, actually, 
as we were about to shut the govern-
ment down. We had a major crisis, and 
they did an emergency meeting on 
cheese. 
They couldn’t even get their act to-
gether to keep the lights on. They lit-
erally lost the majority because of how 
badly they ran this place, and then 
they handed us a shutdown of govern-
ment, the longest shutdown in history, 
by the way. That cost American tax-
payers $11 billion. 
When Republicans were in charge, I 
voted to give them same-day author-
ity. I stood on this floor and urged my 
Democratic colleagues to support the 
rule because I wanted to give us extra 
flexibility to do the work the American 
people had asked us to do. 
Republicans ran this place like a dic-
tatorship, and then they tried to turn 
our country into one on January 6, 
2021, a day that will live forever in his-
tory as a date that a twice-impeached 
ex-President and Republicans tried to 
unconstitutionally overturn a free and 
fair election and subvert the will of the 
American people in an attempted coup. 
So, please do not lecture us about 
Democratic process or any process at 
all. Do not lecture us on hypocrisy. 
I said last night in the Rules Com-
mittee what I hoped we would bring 
forward today, and I still hope we will 
move forward on an assault weapons 
ban. 
Do you know why? Because people in 
this country are being massacred, and 
they are tired of thoughts and prayers. 
They are tired of press releases in 
which we say that our hearts are with 
the families of those who were killed. 
They want action. The question is 
whether or not we can deliver on what 
the American people want. 
Do you want to talk about outrage? I 
am outraged by the gun violence in 
this country. I am outraged that an 18- 
year-old who can’t legally have a sip of 
beer can go into a gun store and buy an 
AR–15 and then go out and kill people, 
massacre people. Enough of this. 
This rule preserves the option, if we 
decide to move forward, to be able to 
move forward. That is what this is all 
about. We can talk about whatever you 
want to talk about, but the bottom 
line is that is what this rule does. 
We have an obligation to act with ur-
gency. We have a responsibility to ad-
dress this crisis. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1300 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8589) to prohibit the Securities and Exchange 
Commission from finalizing the proposed 
rule titled ‘‘The Enhancement and Standard-
ization of Climate-Related Disclosures for 
Investors’’. All points of order against con-
sideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Financial Services; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8589. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I move the pre-
vious question on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of adoption of the resolution. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 216, nays 
205, not voting 9, as follows:

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TRAIL 
COMPLETION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
VEASEY). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1254 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares 
the House in the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union 
for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 
5118. 
The Chair appoints the gentlewoman 
from Nevada (Mrs. LEE) to preside over 
the Committee of the Whole. 
b 1136 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 5118) to 
direct the Secretary of Agriculture to 
prioritize the completion of the Conti-
nental Divide National Scenic Trail, 
and for other purposes, with Mrs. LEE 
of Nevada in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read the first time. 
General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and amendments specified in 
House Resolution 1254 and shall not ex-
ceed 1 hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) and the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 5118. 
The CHAIR. That request cannot be 
entertained in the Committee of the 
Whole. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act. This legisla-
tion represents another major effort to 
act on climate by responding to record- 
setting wildfires and drought that are 
impacting 
communities 
across 
our 
country. 
I represent Colorado’s Second Con-
gressional District, and it was barely 
over 6 months ago, in December, when 
the Marshall Fire burned through 
Boulder County and became the most 
destructive fire in Colorado history. 
The fire destroyed a 30-acre subdivision 
in a matter of hours; nearly 200 homes 
burned to the ground and caused over 
$1 billion in damages. 
This comes on the heels of my dis-
trict experiencing the first and second 
largest wildfires in the history of Colo-
rado in Larimer and Grand Counties in 
2020, and as parts of the western United 
States is currently experiencing their 
driest drought conditions in over 1,000 
years. 
Fires have become the primary occu-
pation of so many of our offices. Count-
less constituents come to us, grieving 
the loss of their homes, but also seek-
ing the resources that they deserve 
from the Federal Government. We have 
a duty to provide our constituents with 
the support that they need to rebuild 
and to recover. 
The reality is that we are living with 
a new normal as climate change results 
in a hotter, drier, planet where historic 
drought and record-setting wildfires 
are not merely a possibility, but an in-
evitability. Wildfires no longer occur 
in a season, but throughout the entire 
year. 
I am grateful to my colleagues, to 
Chairman GRIJALVA, Chairman SCOTT, 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, Chairman DEFAZIO, Chair-
man 
PALLONE, 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, Chairwoman 
WATERS, Chairwoman LOFGREN, and 
House leadership for helping bring this 
package to the floor. This is exactly 
the kind of response that our constitu-
ents desperately want to see from Con-
gress. 
H.R. 5118 provides a whole-of-govern-
ment response to the droughts and the 
wildfires impacting American commu-
nities across the country, and it com-
bines more than 50 standalone pieces of 
legislation originating from nine dif-
ferent House committees, including 
Republican and Democratic bills. 
We began this important work last 
year, as my colleagues know, working 
with President Biden to pass the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, 
which included historic investments to 
reduce wildfire risks, improve eco-
system resilience, and ensure reliable 
water supplies. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought 
Resiliency Act builds on those invest-
ments. It provides an increased start-
ing wage for our brave and courageous 
Federal wildland firefighters. It invests 
in water security and in drought resil-
ience and advancing wildfire science. 
As climate-change-induced drought 
means long-term reductions in rain, 
snow, and necessary water supplies, 
this legislation invests in drought- 
proof water projects like water recy-
cling, modern desalination, advancing 
water data management and tech-
nology, protecting and restoring eco-
systems.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7420 
July 29, 2022 
The bill also advances projects to de-
liver reliable water across Indian Coun-
try, including by incorporating key 
provisions from my bill, the Tribal Ac-
cess to Clean Water Act. And it pro-
vides significant resources to prevent 
key Colorado River reservoirs from de-
clining to critically low water levels, 
protecting the supplies of a river that 
40 million Americans, 40 million, rely 
on. 
H.R. 5118 also includes several other 
important pieces of legislation intro-
duced by many Members in the body 
today. Provisions from Tim’s Act, 
named after a heroic smoke jumper, 
Tim Hart, who tragically lost his life 
fighting a wildfire in New Mexico, 
would increase pay and benefits for 
Federal wildland firefighters, and that 
provision is part of this bill. 
Finally, the bill includes provisions 
that would provide flexibility in Fed-
eral FEMA cost shares to support our 
local communities and to protect wa-
tersheds impacted by wildfire. 
Madam Chair, this bill is a good bill, 
and it meets the moment for the Amer-
ican West. And for that reason, I will 
encourage my colleagues today to sup-
port it. I look forward to hearing from 
many of my colleagues who will speak 
on the bill. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Chair, I am glad we are fi-
nally here on the floor today talking 
about an issue that is important to our 
whole country. I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Colorado and his concerns 
about wildfires. I wish that we could 
work together on actually solving 
these issues in a manner and with pol-
icy that would actually do something. 
I learned in engineering school that 
expending effort is not work. For ex-
ample, you can push on a boulder all 
day, but until something moves, no 
work has been accomplished. 
To put it another way, there is a say-
ing that you should never confuse mo-
tion with action, which is exactly what 
the legislation before us today does. 
This bill is more than 550 pages yet 
does absolutely nothing to prevent 
wildfires or significantly improve our 
resiliency to drought. 
This bill will actually make our wild-
fire crisis worse. Perhaps that is why 
my Democrat colleagues named it the 
Wildfire Response Act, instead of nam-
ing it the wildfire prevention act, 
which is what we should be focusing on 
because we will have to respond to all 
the wildfires that are going to happen 
anyway and the new ones that this bill 
creates. 
Here is a little bit of forestry 101. 
There are two ways to reduce wildfire 
risk: thinning and controlled burning. 
This bill mentions thinning zero times. 
Not once does it mention thinning, but 
it mentions environmental justice 165 
times. That should tell you what this 
bill is really about. 
Instead 
of 
streamlining 
environ-
mental regulations and addressing friv-
olous litigation, which delay vital for-
est management projects across the 
country, this bill would add mountains 
of new red tape on our Federal agencies 
that will grind their already glacial 
pace of treatments to a complete halt. 
b 1145 
It would throw out the Forest Serv-
ice’s 10-year strategy to reduce haz-
ardous fuels and make them com-
pletely redo this work less than 6 
months 
after 
they 
started 
imple-
menting their current strategy. 
This makes you wonder if congres-
sional Democrats disagree with the 
work of the Biden administration or if 
they have found the administration’s 
work product is deficient and unreli-
able. 
It would lock up 58 million acres of 
land into new roadless areas, despite 
research showing that more than half 
of all fires, including most of the larg-
est fires on Western U.S. national for-
est lands, burn primarily in roadless 
areas, areas where land use restrictions 
mean that we can’t thin and can’t do 
management. 
Instead, the bill would fund environ-
mental volunteerism and provide N–95 
masks and smoke inhalation equip-
ment for homes, which I am sure will 
be of little comfort to people as their 
homes are burning to the ground. 
Democrats will tell you this legisla-
tion raises wildland firefighter pay to 
$20 per hour. The only problem with 
that is that firefighters already make 
at least $20 per hour, meaning this so- 
called raise is an empty promise. 
In the long term, the bill would write 
a check that it can’t cash by setting up 
this new minimum pay rate with no ac-
tual money to back it up. The Forest 
Service has told us this means they 
would have to lay off over 610 wildland 
firefighters. Let me say that again: 
The Democrats’ bill could result in the 
firing of more than 610 wildland fire-
fighters who are putting their lives on 
the line to protect communities. This 
is a disgrace and will hurt our fire pre-
paredness and response. 
As if that weren’t enough, the bill 
would create new pay disparities by 
leaving out 10,000 brave men and 
women fighting fires from receiving 
new benefits. That is roughly 40 per-
cent of the Federal firefighting work-
force. 
Some of my Western colleagues will 
soon speak about the water provisions 
in this bill, but I want to say that the 
bill misses the mark on drought as well 
by proposing $4 billion in new author-
izations and has unlimited mandatory 
spending. 
Once again, the other side of the aisle 
is passing on more debt to our future 
generations, and we see what uncon-
trolled spending has done to our econ-
omy with inflation, high energy prices, 
high food prices, and, really, higher 
prices across the board. 
According to conventional econom-
ics, we have had two quarters of eco-
nomic decline, and we are in a reces-
sion. Why would we want to put more 
government funding and debt on our 
constituents? I do not understand. 
It would also devote some of these 
dollars to studies, research, and envi-
ronmental water restoration projects 
that will not provide any water in the 
near term. 
It picks winners and losers in water 
projects, ignoring the need for ex-
panded water storage reservoirs, the 
kind of infrastructure investment that 
has made the West what it is today and 
is necessary to ensure a drought-resil-
ient future. 
This bill offers a one-dimensional ap-
proach to solving the Western drought 
that has impacted the entire country 
through decreased agricultural produc-
tion. Reservoirs operated by the Bu-
reau of Reclamation provide needed 
water to 10 million acres of farmland 
that collectively grow 60 percent of the 
Nation’s vegetables and one quarter of 
our fresh fruit and nut crops. 
By throwing money at an issue and 
not 
recognizing 
that 
regulatory 
streamlining to expand water storage 
and efficiency of operations to promote 
drought resiliency should be part of 
this equation, this bill fails not only 
the West but everyone who buys food 
nationwide. Put another way, this bill 
fails every American household. This is 
bad policy and bad process. 
Democrats cobbled together this 550- 
plus-page bill behind closed doors, and 
not one wildfire provision was marked 
up in the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. 
Republican Members made real at-
tempts to provide alternatives and ad-
ditions to this bill. Dozens of regu-
latory streamlining amendments that 
could have helped provide water or im-
mediately 
prevented 
wildfires 
were 
submitted to the Rules Committee by 
Republicans, only to be ignored. Even 
the majority of bipartisan amendments 
were rejected. 
This is an abomination of process, 
but it is nothing new that we are see-
ing on this House floor. If you were 
here last night, you know that a Sen-
ate 
NEPA 
streamlining 
bill 
was 
parachuted in at the last minute. It 
was put on the suspension calendar. 
I hope this bill passes during the next 
voting series, but we should be doing 
NEPA 
revisions 
through 
hearings, 
through markups, and through regular 
order. If it takes getting one dropped in 
on the suspension calendar by the Sen-
ate, I guess we will have to take what 
we have got. But it would be nice if we 
could actually debate these and come 
up with more NEPA streamlining. 
In the midst of historic drought con-
ditions and what is on track to be the 
most devastating wildfire season on 
record, we simply cannot afford to con-
fuse motion with action. 
Madam Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to re-
ject this partisan package and, instead, 
work together on real solutions to pre-
vent wildfires.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7421 
July 29, 2022 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me just say this: The gentleman 
is entitled to his own opinion but not 
to his own facts, and I take great um-
brage at his reference to the word ‘‘dis-
grace.’’ 
He knows and my colleagues know 
just as well as anyone in this Chamber 
that the pay increase that was author-
ized by the bipartisan infrastructure 
law, which, by the way, my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle voted 
against, all but 13 of them, that pay in-
crease expires a year from now. 
Every wildland firefighter in the 
United States will receive a pay dimi-
nution if this bill isn’t passed, if we 
don’t authorize the pay increases that 
are in this bill. It is a disgrace to sug-
gest anything otherwise. 
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN). 
Ms. 
LOFGREN. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
his leadership on this issue. 
Climate change has brought the most 
severe drought to the West in hundreds 
and hundreds of years, and it has cre-
ated an environment where wildfires 
are roaring through the West. 
In fact, seven of the worst wildfires 
in California history have occurred in 
the last 4 years. They are destroying 
homes, 
farms, 
infrastructure. 
They 
cause injury. That is why this bill is so 
important. 
I am proud that four of my bills are 
incorporated in the legislation that 
will allow firefighters to get overtime 
they have earned and allow for FEMA 
to predeploy assets and, yes, to use 
science in the fight against wildfires. 
I am proud of the chair and ranking 
member of the Committee on Science 
who have turned their attention to the 
things that can be done to advance 
funding for the critical research that is 
happening at places like San Jose 
State University in their Wildfire 
Interdisciplinary Research Center. 
We 
can’t 
prevent 
all 
disasters, 
Madam Chair, but we can use our 
power and use our science to better 
prepare, to better counter these disas-
ters, and, yes, to make sure that those 
who are victimized by the disasters are 
treated fairly. They are our neighbors. 
We need to help them in their time of 
loss. 
Madam Chair, I thank the Speaker 
for making this a priority. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to point out those weren’t 
my words. That was the information 
we got from the U.S. Forest Service 
that said there is no funding in this 
bill. If this bill passes without addi-
tional funding in the future, they will 
have to lay off 610 wildland firefighters. 
Maybe there is going to be a bill in 
the future to pour more money into the 
Forest Service, but this bill doesn’t do 
it. 
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Agriculture. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding and for his leadership on 
this issue. If there is anyone that 
should be leading this discussion, it 
should be somebody whose career was 
as a professionally trained forester who 
actually knows this topic. 
I rise in opposition to this legisla-
tion. Wildfire is a national crisis that 
we must confront immediately. Tens of 
millions of acres are overgrown and 
unhealthy, but this bill won’t meet 
those challenges or provide the Forest 
Service with the tools that they need 
to combat this threat. 
The Forest Service has already an-
nounced a strategy to treat 50 million 
acres. Mandating a new plan is duplica-
tive, removes flexibility, creates re-
strictions, and limits projects. 
This bill authorizes billions for recre-
ation, wilderness programs, and old 
growth, which have nothing to do with 
protecting 
communities 
and 
miti-
gating wildfire. Because this is only 
authorizing 
legislation, 
the 
Forest 
Service will be directed to carry out 
the provisions without being provided 
the necessary funding. 
Additionally, there are none of the 
much-needed regulatory reforms that 
would allow the Forest Service to in-
crease the pace and scale of restoration 
and wildfire mitigation. 
There have been no committee hear-
ings, markups, stakeholder feedback, 
or technical assistance. The majority 
also blocked nearly every amendment 
filed from even being debated today. 
The provisions within the Committee 
on Agriculture’s jurisdiction are large-
ly unvetted but are being crammed 
into this 558-page bill, which we only 
first saw last week. 
Madam Chair, let me just say, on the 
issue of firefighting, I served as a state- 
certified firefighter, so, on behalf of my 
brothers and sisters, I appreciate what 
they 
do, 
those 
that 
are 
fighting 
wildfires or structure fires. 
But I agree with the ranking member 
here that the Forest Service’s own 
words said that they were going to 
have to lay off more than 610 wildland 
firefighters because of this bill. 
What my brothers and sisters who 
are wildland firefighters need more 
than anything else are other fire-
fighters. They are the primary tool 
when it comes to battling these con-
flagrations. 
This bill is an insult to them, an au-
thorizing bill that provides no addi-
tional funds. Quite frankly, Madam 
Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would, again, simply say the irony 
is rich. My colleagues will vote against 
the authorization for more wildland 
firefighter pay, and then when we fight 
for the appropriation, they will vote 
against it, too. So, it is a bit difficult 
to hear them make those claims. 
I also would say that the 10-year For-
est Service management plan is some-
thing we support, I support. I am glad 
to hear my colleagues support it be-
cause they all voted against it. 
Literally, a year ago, when we passed 
a bill in this Chamber to authorize the 
Forest Service to spend $20 million to 
invest in forest management in Idaho, 
Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, 
where were they? They voted against 
it. Now, they claim to support it, yet 
they will vote against a bill that au-
thorizes more projects along those 
same lines. 
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE). 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding time, and I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response 
and Drought Resiliency Act. 
Climate change and extreme weather 
are already wreaking havoc on Amer-
ican families and businesses. Every 
day, 
we 
read 
news 
stories 
about 
drought conditions in the West and the 
corn belt, wildfires displacing Ameri-
cans from their homes, and the poten-
tial collapse of Texas’ power grid from 
extreme heat and unreliable fossil fuel 
power plants. 
Just this week, in my home State of 
New Jersey, Governor Murphy is en-
couraging residents to conserve water 
due to dry conditions. 
Now, the impacts of climate and ex-
treme weather are truly being felt ev-
erywhere. That is why I am proud to 
support this package of commonsense 
proposals, including many from the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, to 
mitigate the effects of extreme weath-
er on our electric grid and water re-
sources. 
I just want to highlight a couple of 
the key provisions from our com-
mittee. 
The bill includes legislation from 
Representative O’HALLERAN, requiring 
the Federal Government to identify 
grid infrastructure that is vulnerable 
to natural disasters. 
It includes Representative CASTEN’s 
legislation to ensure that different re-
gions of the country can share power 
during extreme weather events. 
The legislation also includes a provi-
sion from Representative PANETTA to 
increase the energy resilience and pro-
ductivity of critical facilities through 
investments in microgrids, energy stor-
age, and energy efficiency. 
Finally, it includes two provisions 
championed by Representative MCNER-
NEY. The first would help water sys-
tems implement water loss control pro-
grams and water efficiency programs, 
and the second directs the Federal Gov-
ernment to study the need and feasi-
bility for standards to ensure that 
power plants are capable of operating 
in drought conditions. 
Madam Chair, this legislation is es-
sential to helping us address the cli-
mate crisis. Frankly, this legislation 
should garner overwhelming bipartisan 
support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7422 
July 29, 2022 
I can’t understand why my Repub-
lican colleagues would oppose the bill. 
They have farmers in their districts 
whose crops are ravaged by drought. 
They represent homeowners displaced 
by wildfires. They certainly have con-
stituents who use the power grid. 
Extreme weather clearly threatens 
our security, but my Republican col-
leagues seem content to watch the 
world burn. I am not, and neither are 
my Democratic colleagues. That is why 
I will vote for H.R. 5118, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I know there is a lot of talk about 
the IIJA and what a great bill it was. It 
was the largest infrastructure bill 
passed in the history of the world. It 
was so important that it never even 
went through a committee here in the 
House. It came right to the House 
floor, and it seems like all we are doing 
is fixing it. We have a suspension bill 
we will be voting on later that fixes a 
problem that was in the IIJA. 
I am confused why my colleague is 
pushing this bill that would undo much 
of the core work in the IIJA, including 
the $170 million that would go to his 
district 
under 
the 
current 
10-year 
strategy. 
I think it is another example of why 
we have to do regular order and why we 
have to bring these bills to committee. 
b 1200 
We want to solve these problems, but 
you have to have real solutions to 
solve a problem. There are examples of 
how we can do bipartisan work to fix 
forestry. 
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), who is working on bipar-
tisan forestry legislation. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his work. This is prob-
ably one of the areas we work on where 
his knowledge when it comes to the 
forest, healthy forests, and making 
sure they are there for the future is so 
important. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment, which would simply establish a 
program to incentivize larger commu-
nities to integrate nearby smaller, 
rural communities into their drinking 
water systems when the smaller com-
munities’ drinking water wells run dry. 
In my district, the community of 
Tooleville has run out of water, as the 
groundwater table drops, and aging in-
frastructure fails or becomes obsolete. 
While the long-term solution is to con-
nect Tooleville to the city of Exeter’s 
drinking water system, that can be ex-
pensive for both Exeter and Tooleville. 
This amendment would reduce con-
nection costs for Tooleville residents 
while also enabling Exeter to increase 
its water supply to meet increased de-
mands with its customers. 
Tulare County advises me that if 
California’s droughts continue, more 
small and rural communities in my dis-
trict with older infrastructure could 
meet the exact same fate as ground-
water tables drop, making this amend-
ment even more important. We cannot 
leave our Western communities vulner-
able to drought and aging infrastruc-
ture. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this amendment. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
include 
in 
the 
RECORD letters supporting my amend-
ment from the county of Tulare, coun-
ty of Kern, and city of Exeter, all of 
which are located in my congressional 
district. 
COUNTY OF TULARE, 
Visalia, CA, July 26, 2022. 
Re H.R. Conway/McCarthy Amendment to 
H.R. 5118, Wildfire Response and Drought 
Resiliency Act—Support. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CONNIE CONWAY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR HOUSE MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY 
AND REPRESENTATIVE CONWAY: On behalf of 
the Tulare County Board of Supervisors, I 
write in support of House Minority Leader 
McCarthy and Congresswoman Conway’s pro-
posed amendment to H.R. 5118, the Wildfire 
Response and Drought Resiliency Act. The 
proposed amendment will address critical 
water supply challenges faced by our Coun-
ty’s most vulnerable and underserved popu-
lations. 
Tulare County oversees more than 50 cen-
sus designated places and unincorporated 
communities across California’s Central Val-
ley. The majority of these sparsely populated 
districts rely upon groundwater to sustain 
daily life which continues to be adversely af-
fected by drought induced water quality and 
quantity issues. Every community and mu-
nicipality in Tulare County depend upon a 
system of wells to guarantee the water needs 
of their residents. As the California drought 
persists, water service providers of our eco-
nomically 
dis-advantaged 
communities 
struggle to find the required funding to exca-
vate deeper wells or upgrade the infrastruc-
ture required to connect with nearby water 
systems. 
The proposed amendment to H.R. 5118 
would authorize significant grant funding 
that would fully fund water projects for our 
small unincorporated communities elimi-
nating the current funding barriers in place 
that delay sustainable water solutions for up 
to six years before any ground can be bro-
ken. Our most vulnerable residents should 
not have to wait that long to have access to 
clean and sufficient drinking water. 
For these reasons and more, the County of 
Tulare supports this proposed amendment 
and urges its adoption by the House. 
EDDIE VALERO, 
Chair, Tulare County Board of Supervisors. 
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, 
Kern County, CA, July 26, 2022. 
Re Amendments to H.R. 5118, Rural Commu-
nities Drinking Water Resiliency—Sup-
port. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN MCCARTHY: I am writ-
ing on behalf of the Kern County Board of 
Supervisors to express our strong support for 
the amendments to H.R. 5118 authored by 
you and Congresswoman Conway. The pro-
posed rural communities drinking water re-
siliency appropriation of $50 million per year 
through 2027 will provide desperately needed 
resources for those in our community whose 
potable water wells run dry. 
In 2021, the Board declared a local emer-
gency due to severe water shortages and con-
ditions of extreme drought within Kern 
County. State Water Project deliveries were 
reduced to only 5 percent of full contract 
amounts in water year 2021 and the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture designated Kern, 
among 50 other California counties, as pri-
mary natural disaster areas due to drought. 
Since then, drought conditions have wors-
ened. According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration’s US Drought Mon-
itor released on July 21, over 97 percent of 
California is now in a severe drought and 
over 59 percent is considered to be in ex-
treme drought. With roughly four months of 
hot, dry weather likely until the winter 
rainy season begins again next November, 
precious groundwater resources will con-
tinue to decline. 
California’s water challenges are mounting 
as more intense and prolonged droughts 
recur. Rural communities are most suscep-
tible to losing running water because they 
typically rely on groundwater from small 
community or domestic wells, which tend to 
run dry during these periods. Access to water 
is a fundamental human right and every Cal-
ifornian should be able turn on their tap and 
expect clean water to flow. 
For these reasons, the Kern County Board 
of Supervisors strongly supports your pro-
posed amendments to H.R. 5118 and urges the 
House to adopt them without delay. 
Sincerely, 
ZACK SCRIVNER, 
Chairman, Kern County Board of Supervisors. 
CITY OF EXETER, 
OFFICE OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, 
Exeter, CA, July 27, 2022. 
Re McCarthy/Conway Amendment to the 
Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act (H.R. 5118). 
To Rep. MCCARTHY and Rep. CONWAY: The 
City of Exeter supports the McCarthy/ 
Conway Amendment to the Wildfire Re-
sponse and Drought Resiliency Act (H.R. 
5118). One of the biggest stumbling blocks for 
an agency to supply water to an adjacent 
rural community is funding for the improve-
ments needed not only to make the connec-
tion but also to the agency system to be able 
to supply water outside their jurisdiction. 
Most cities don’t have the means to do this 
on their own, especially since the agency 
rate payers cannot be burdened with this ad-
ditional cost, which is illegal to do in most 
cases. This amendment would help cities like 
Exeter to fund the needed improvements to 
make these connections a possibility. Ac-
cordingly, we urge its adoption by the House. 
If you have any questions, please feel free 
to contact me. 
Thank you, 
ADAM ENNIS, 
City Administrator. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Chair, now, 
why are we asking for this amend-
ment? 
The one thing you would have to see, 
there have been no major reservoirs 
built in California since 1979. Think of 
the population difference in between 
that time. 
California is very blessed. We get 
snow in the north, we grow the agri-
culture for the world in the Central 
Valley—my good friend from the other 
side of the aisle, I believe that is where 
his family used to be from—and in the

south, we have major population. But 
no new reservoirs. 
Now we have got challenges where 
cities are actually running out of 
water, but it is not that we don’t have 
enough water. In those wet years, we 
can save it. We can even pump it out of 
the ground to bring it back out. But in 
California, at times they care more 
about a fish and the water goes out to 
the ocean. 
Now, we talk about desalinization. 
So we would spend billions of dollars to 
create a desalinization plant for the 
freshwater we put into the ocean to 
make it saltwater to bring it back into 
freshwater. 
Why wouldn’t we just store more 
water for those dry years? 
We have worked on this issue for 
quite some time. We actually think the 
greatest return on investment would be 
to just lift Shasta Dam, the reservoir. 
If you simply enlarged it, it could store 
more. 
We got to a bipartisan bill, the WIIN 
Act, working with DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
It passed this House with big numbers. 
It passed the Senate with more than 70 
votes. 
But you know what happened after it 
passed? 
Speaker PELOSI and other Democrats 
fought it, actually killed the ability 
that California could determine their 
own destiny. 
And now today we come down, and 
this is supposed to be a wildfire bill. In 
my State, we have wildfires all the 
time. We have one raging right now. 
We have a very large one in Yosemite. 
Also in California, we are blessed to 
be the only State in the world that 
grows giant sequoias. You all know 
that iconic tree. You all know and have 
seen it before. It grows for 2,000 to 3,000 
years. History tells us that the only 
major time we have ever seen a giant 
sequoia die was in 1297 from a fire. Nor-
mally they just die because they get so 
large and they topple over. 
But do you realize in the last 2 years 
we have lost 20 percent of all the giant 
sequoias? There is a warning right now 
that we can lose them all just in the 
next couple years. Firefighters right 
now are risking their lives to protect 
them. 
But you know what? This body can 
be very proud of the fact that there is 
a bipartisan bill, Save Our Sequoias, 
with the same number of Democrats 
and Republicans on that piece of legis-
lation. They would go into these 
groves, clean out, and protect them 
where firefighters wouldn’t have to 
risk their lives, or even when fires 
came, these giant sequoias would con-
tinue to live. 
It has been introduced. How did that 
bill get introduced? 
Because a bipartisan group went to 
the giant sequoias, studied what need-
ed to happen, and came together. Ev-
erybody didn’t get what they want, but 
at the end of the day they could save 
the giant sequoias. 
You know what is not in this bill? 
Save Our Sequoias. 
This is a wildfire bill that won’t even 
save the sequoias, even though the 
President talked about this just last 
week, that it was a big concern to him. 
Why wouldn’t it get put in? 
It is not that it hasn’t been through 
committee 
because 
the 
committee 
won’t bring it up. But that is not the 
pattern of the Democrats. It doesn’t 
matter if a bill has been through com-
mittee or not; they will drop anything 
in. 
This is a bill that both sides agree 
upon. I have to give credit to the 
Democrats—Congressmen PETERS, PA-
NETTA, COSTA, and others—who went to 
the giant sequoias to study the issue to 
know what needs to happen, to work 
toward it, and save them. 
Why would we want to destroy them? 
Why would we not use this oppor-
tunity and put it in this bill? 
Is it because it is bipartisan? 
Can you only bring bills to the floor 
that are partisan? 
It is interesting when my constitu-
ents ask—all the challenges on this 
floor, when my constituents were going 
to ask me about a firefighter bill to 
help save our forests, but it would 
eliminate 610 firefighters? 
Only a Democrat Congress could 
think that is a wildfire bill, that you 
are going to eliminate 610 firefighters. 
How is that going to protect them 
more? 
It is only in this Congress that you 
could have a bill that is called the 
American Rescue Plan that creates in-
flation. 
It is only in the American Rescue 
Plan that you could tell the American 
public, can you afford to lose a month’s 
salary? 
No one will say yes, but that is ex-
actly what you took from them. That 
is what inflation has done. 
This bill is needed, not the bill you 
have written, but on this issue. You 
have Save the Sequoias, it is a crisis 
before us, and you will not even put it 
in the bill when it is bipartisan. 
I cannot imagine that you would 
bring a bill forward that would elimi-
nate firefighters that we need when we 
are on fire. 
And I cannot imagine that you 
wouldn’t work to build more reservoirs 
so people can store water in the wet 
years so it will be there in the dry 
years. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I have just a few key points. 
First, I understand why there is some 
confusion on the other side regarding 
the firefighter pay provision because, 
again, my colleagues voted against in-
creasing firefighter pay a year ago 
when the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
was before this body, so I understand 
that they are prepared to vote against 
it again. 
I would just simply say with respect 
to the provisions of this bill, and 
whether they are bipartisan, partisan 
or not, I suspect that Representative 
LAMALFA, whose H.R. 4505 is in this 
bill, would disagree. I suspect H.R. 5345, 
a bill introduced by Mr. MOORE which 
is also in this bill, I think tends to re-
fute that fact. 
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Chair, I join 
my colleagues in support of the Wild-
fire Response and Drought Resiliency 
Act. I support this bill because we are 
in the midst of a crisis. After decades 
of severe drought, the Colorado River, 
which supplies water to 40 million peo-
ple across seven States, is on the brink 
of collapse. The future of Arizona and 
the entire American Southwest de-
pends on how we respond. 
Bold action to protect our water sup-
ply has never been more important, 
and the Federal Government needs to 
act with the urgency before it is too 
late. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought 
Resiliency Act is a necessary step to 
help our communities deal with the im-
pacts of climate change and a drier fu-
ture. It builds on the investments in 
the bipartisan infrastructure law to 
use our water more efficiently, and it 
includes my legislation to provide $500 
million for immediate action to pro-
tect critical water levels in Lake Mead 
and Lake Powell. 
Time is of the essence. We must act 
now. We cannot allow this crisis to 
turn into a catastrophe. I urge my col-
leagues to save the Colorado River, 
save the American Southwest, and sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, 
this is the Democratic equivalent of 
fiddling while our forests burn. They 
call it the Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act, but while it 
spends lavishly, it accomplishes almost 
nothing. 
For 14 years in Congress, I have dealt 
extensively with issues of fire and 
water, and here is what I have learned: 
Excess timber will always come out of 
the forest. Either we will carry it out 
or nature will burn it out. When we 
carried it out by logging, we enjoyed 
healthy forests and a thriving econ-
omy. 
We stopped active forest manage-
ment decades ago due to radical envi-
ronmental laws that have made it im-
possible. Today our forests are now 
morbidly overgrown, and nature is 
again burning out the excess. 
This bill does nothing to reform the 
laws that have made active forest man-
agement impossible, and instead it 
consigns us to fight a losing battle that 
will cost us our forests for generations 
to come. 
When it comes to water, droughts are 
nature’s fault. They happen. But water 
shortages are our fault. They are the 
choice we made when the same radical 
laws made new dam construction im-
possible. Dams save water for wet

years so that we have plenty in the dry 
ones. We will not solve our water 
shortage until we build more dams, and 
we can’t build more dams until we 
overhaul these same laws. 
Instead, this bill pours hundreds of 
millions of dollars into desalination. 
The most successful desalination plant 
is in Carlsbad, California. At a time 
when we can’t guarantee enough elec-
tricity to keep your lights on, Carlsbad 
consumes enough electricity to power 
250 homes in order to produce enough 
water for one home. 
This bill is pure folly. It will con-
sume billions of dollars of our re-
sources while condemning us to a dis-
mal future of chronic forest fires and 
water shortages. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Chair, it is 
great to see the gentlewoman in the 
chair. I thank Chairman GRIJALVA for 
bringing this important bill to the 
floor, and I applaud the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE), my friend 
and colleague, for leading this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Re-
sponse and Drought Resiliency Act. 
As a native of Las Vegas, I grew up 
with frequent trips to Lake Mead, 
which is part of my district. That is 
why it is heartbreaking to see levels at 
Lake Mead at their lowest point since 
the reservoir was first filled in 1937. It 
is currently only 27 percent full. 
Madam Chair, Nevada and much of 
the U.S. West has experienced a very 
hot and dry summer, fueling drought 
and even fires in some areas. 
In this year’s appropriation bill, we 
secured $6 million for the Lake Mead/ 
Las Vegas Wash program to directly 
address the falling water levels, and 
this legislation, the Wildfire Response 
and Drought Resiliency Act, will fur-
ther address some of the issues being 
caused by this heat and drought. 
This package represents 49 individual 
Member bills, bringing together many 
great ideas and solutions to the prob-
lem. 
Madam Chair, it establishes new hir-
ing authorities and minimum basic pay 
for the brave men and women who 
serve as wildland firefighters. 
It provides $500 million to prevent 
key reservoirs, like Lake Mead, from 
declining to unsafe levels. 
It invests in drought-proof water in-
frastructure, like water recycling and 
desalinization projects. 
This legislation also secures water 
reliability for Indian Country, invest-
ing $1 billion in Tribal clean water ac-
cess. 
And it will support the development 
of modern water management data and 
technology. 
H.R. 5118 will protect and restore im-
portant ecosystems, and I encourage 
this body to pass this legislation. 
b 1215 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, 
many of the water and power users in 
the Colorado basin were not consulted 
on this $500 million Colorado River pro-
vision and don’t even know what it 
would be used for. That is another rea-
son why we should actually work on 
these issues in committee and have a 
bipartisan markup. 
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Chair, 
while I cannot support the entirety of 
the package we are considering today, 
I am grateful that my bipartisan, bi-
cameral Saline Lake Ecosystems in the 
Great Basin States Program Act was 
included in this bill. 
This important legislation, which 
moved through the House Natural Re-
sources Committee with unanimous 
support, will be the first step in ad-
dressing the challenges many Utahns 
know we are going through right now 
with the Great Salt Lake and other sa-
line lakes. 
Let me say a special thank-you to 
my friend from California, Congress-
man HUFFMAN. He and I disagree on 
many issues, the entirety, almost, of 
this bill or this approach, but I do ap-
preciate the relationship that we have 
been able to establish so we can get 
this to the point where we got it today. 
It is very important to my State. My 
State legislature has been working on 
this, as well as our Governor. It has 
been a key aspect. 
Let me add one piece about what we 
are going to be talking about today. 
The Republican team, led by Mr. 
WESTERMAN, has exceptional ideas on 
how to get out ahead of this issue that 
we are facing with wildfires, and we 
want to have that voice and have that 
be implemented more on these issues. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I say 
thank you to my Republican colleague 
and neighbor from Utah and that we 
are glad we can get his bill into this 
important bipartisan Wildfire Response 
and Drought Resiliency Act package. 
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
O’HALLERAN). 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding. I also thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA for the work he put in. 
I rise to speak, Madam Chair, in sup-
port of the Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act. This bill in-
cludes many long-fought initiatives to 
address the mega-drought and year- 
round wildfires we see in Arizona. 
Arizona’s First Congressional Dis-
trict encompasses rural and Tribal 
communities, 
six 
national 
forests, 
three Tribal forests, along with the 
Grand Canyon. There is no longer a 
wildfire season in northern Arizona. 
Deadly wildfires happen year-round, 
and these fires threaten our homes, 
businesses, and communities. 
Included within the final package are 
several bills that address key policy 
steps we can take to address wildfires, 
drought, and public safety in our na-
tional forests. 
This legislation allows for the hiring 
of more Forest Service law enforce-
ment officers, which will improve safe-
ty and oversight of our forests, espe-
cially during high-risk days when fires 
can start in an instant. 
Another critical provision included 
will create a grant program to remove 
nonnative plant species, like salt ce-
dars, that contribute to drought and 
fire conditions. 
Importantly, also within this pack-
age are two Tribal water settlements 
that I have fought for since 2017 when 
I arrived in Congress, the White Moun-
tain Apache Tribe and Hualapai Tribe 
water settlements. The Tribes have 
been waiting decades for these Federal 
approvals. 
In addition, these settlements will 
provide the State of Arizona with 
greater surety in its water future. 
Today, I am looking forward to join-
ing my colleagues gathered here to 
vote to pass this critical package of 
bills. I also acknowledge that there is a 
tremendous amount of work over dec-
ades that has not been done by this 
Congress that it has to complete. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Chair, I 
thank my friend from Arkansas for al-
lowing me to speak on this important 
issue. 
Madam Chair, rural communities 
across the country are plagued by per-
sistent 
drought 
and 
catastrophic 
wildfires, especially communities in 
the Western United States. As the Rep-
resentative for Washington’s Fourth 
Congressional District and as chairman 
of the Congressional Western Caucus, I 
have been consistently calling for these 
issues to be taken up in committees 
and here on the House floor. 
In one sense, I am very glad that our 
colleagues from across the aisle are fi-
nally realizing just how crucial these 
issues are, but I am disappointed by 
the fact that today’s rushed package of 
provisions fails to address the root 
challenges that we face in the West and 
ignores a myriad of solutions that were 
offered by my Republican colleagues. 
Rather than fixing our broken, dupli-
cative requirements under the National 
Environmental Policy Act, this pack-
age adds more regulation and bureau-
cratic red tape. Rather than enhancing 
opportunities for long-term water stor-
age infrastructure and offering any 
type of lasting solutions for forests and 
species management, it focuses on add-
ing 
environmental 
studies 
and 
prioritizing environmental justice. 
Madam Chair, my colleagues and I 
submitted numerous amendments that 
would actually solve these problems— 
to encourage additional water storage, 
active land forest management, com-
monsense reforms to the Endangered 
Species Act, and critically needed do-
mestic energy and timber development. 
Unfortunately, Madam Chair, Demo-
crats refused to even let these amend-
ments be considered for debate. 
This bill fails to address the actual 
problems facing rural communities and

will likely exacerbate the very issues 
Democrats claim the bill addresses. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I have 
great respect for my colleague from 
Washington, and we have worked to-
gether closely in the past. 
I would just say that we are consid-
ering a number of amendments today, 
including an amendment from the Re-
publican leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, who 
spent a great deal of time on the floor 
just a few moments ago talking about 
his particular amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Chair, I 
rise today in support of the Wildfire 
Response and Drought Resiliency Act 
as wildfires have been burning across 
my home State of New Mexico and our 
life-giving Rio Grande has dried for the 
first time in decades in significant 
stretches of the river. This bill is vital 
to supporting our communities as they 
are responding to the impacts and 
working to build a more resilient fu-
ture. 
This year, communities across our 
State have been battling unprece-
dented wildfires that have devastated 
homes and livelihoods and taken the 
lives of four first responders just a cou-
ple of weeks ago from Bernalillo Coun-
ty in my home district, exacerbated by 
a millennial drought and the impacts 
of global climate change. 
But we are New Mexicans, and we are 
resilient. This bill, which includes our 
wildfire legislation and three of my 
water bills, is crucial to the future of 
our State. 
That is why I am so incredibly grate-
ful for the leadership of this body, to 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader HOYER, my 
good 
friend 
Representative 
JOE 
NEGUSE, and our amazing committee 
chairman, Mr. GRIJALVA, for their in-
credible leadership in meeting this mo-
ment and putting together a com-
prehensive package to address drought 
and wildfire across our country. 
These bills will empower our commu-
nities, our Tribes, and our Pueblos, 
who have depended on these life-giving 
waters since time immemorial, our 
acequias and our land grants, who have 
depended on these lands and waters for 
generations, and empower our commu-
nities with the tools, resources, and 
science to meet the moment. 
My bipartisan Water Data Act will 
help unlock the power of big data and 
science to help transform water man-
agement across the United States. 
Our Rio Grande Water Security Act 
will help to create a framework for col-
laboration and innovation to keep 
water in our precious river. 
The WaterSMART Access for Tribes 
Act will help to lower barriers so that 
our Tribes and Pueblos can access vital 
funding for water security projects. 
Our Hermits Peak bill will help to 
make our communities that have been 
devastated by wildfires whole again. 
Madam Chair, we must pass the Wild-
fire Response and Drought Resiliency 
Act, and we must pass it to prevent 
more devastating fires. We must pass it 
to ensure that our life-giving rivers do 
not continue to run dry. We must pass 
this legislation so that our commu-
nities have the tools and the resources 
that they need to remain resilient. 
Madam Chair, the time to act is now, 
and the time to support our commu-
nities is now. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Chair, what 
is a just transition to so-called clean 
energy? We have been hearing the term 
all week from my colleagues across the 
aisle. Does a just transition mean the 
highest inflation in 40 years or record 
energy prices? Does it mean handing 
out billions of dollars to the green so-
cialist lobby? 
Does a just transition mean we let 
our Federal forests burn year over year 
without maintaining them? Or does it 
mean we don’t give Tribes the same 
ability to take care of the forests as 
States have? 
Just transition means some, but not 
all, can maintain the spaces around 
them, and I am disappointed that my 
amendment was not included in today’s 
bill. 
My amendment would have enabled 
Native Tribes and counties, which have 
to live with the unmanaged forests 
around them, to have an opportunity 
to help our forests be healthy. 
I stand in opposition to this bill for a 
lot of reasons, just two of which are 
not including Tribes and counties in 
this so-called wildfire response pack-
age. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Chair, I thank Chairman GRIJALVA and 
everybody who has worked to bring 
this bill to the floor today. 
A historic drought has forced ranch-
ers in our parched Eastern Plains to 
sell their cattle early. 
We don’t collect and share data about 
our precious water resources with the 
ranchers, Tribes, and farmers who need 
it most. 
Four brave firefighters lost their 
lives battling wildfires across my beau-
tiful State. Five more people died in 
the fires and the floods from the burn 
scars. Today, I honor each of those 
nine souls and their grieving friends 
and family. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought 
Resiliency Act is like a gentle monsoon 
rain falling on our thirsty landscape. It 
brings real solutions to these problems. 
It includes my Hermits Peak-Calf 
Canyon fire bill to compensate those 
who lost their ancestral homes, busi-
nesses, and ranches when the Forest 
Service started not one but two fires 
that became an inferno of destruction. 
These fires scorched 534 square miles of 
land in Mora, San Miguel, and Taos 
Counties. 
When I visited the burn scar, Bran-
don Bustos, a third grader evacuated 
from his beloved village, said: ‘‘Mora 
will be back. I guarantee it.’’ He has 
not given up on his future. Neither 
have I, and neither have any of us who 
will vote for this bill because this bill 
will help Mora rebuild. 
It will pay firefighters a minimum 
wage that is necessary because they 
risk their lives for us. It will invest in 
burn centers of excellence and the 
science, technology, and data sharing 
we need to build resiliency and make 
every precious drop of water count be-
cause agua es vida. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote for the bill today. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Chair, I ap-
preciate Mr. NEGUSE working on this 
legislation here, but to have this all in 
a catchall bill—in my home State of 
California, the two biggest things 
going on are wildfire and drought, 
other than politics. So, to have so lit-
tle time to put this together, I wish we 
had more time to work on this. 
I appreciate that he included a small 
piece on biochar that I was working on, 
but the big picture here is the drought 
is affecting so much of my State. These 
crops listed here, many of them 100 per-
cent of what is used in the United 
States. Hundreds of thousands of acres 
are being left out. 
The people in this country will not 
see these crops come from California or 
the U.S. They will come from other 
countries if we get them at all. 
On the forestry side, I had the Dixie 
fire last year. That was a million acres. 
Yet, we are going to take the power 
away from the Forest Service, which 
already moves at a glacial pace of 1 
percent per year under their 10-year 
plan of treating forests lands—take 
away 600 of their staff and basically 
just make it that much slower for the 
Forest Service to respond. 
Between 
the 
drought 
and 
the 
weaponizing, possibly, of monitoring 
against farmers the water supply, we 
are going backward on this. So, I am 
disappointed. 
b 1230 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I would 
say first, we are glad that we got Mr. 
LAMALFA’s H.R. 4505 into this bill, and 
I am looking forward to supporting it 
today. I have to, again, respond to this 
argument that has been made about 
the 10-year plan. 
I would hope that my colleagues and 
I could agree to argue the merits of the 
bill based on the text of the bill. The 
bill makes clear that the activities 
that the Forest Service is mandated to 
implement include the Wildfire Crisis 
Landscape Investments plan titled: 
‘‘Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: Ini-
tial Landscape Investments to Protect 
Communities and Improve Resilience 
in American’s Forests’’ dated April 
2002. What is that document? That is

the 10-year plan that the Forest Serv-
ice authorized that we voted for back 
last November. So this codifies that 
and builds upon it by giving the Forest 
Service more resources to do even 
more landscape restoration and forest 
management across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Chair, I rise today 
with my daughters in strong support of 
H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act. This legisla-
tion includes my bill, the Salton Sea 
Projects Improvements Act, which will 
take strong action to address the crisis 
at the Salton Sea. 
In our region, drought and reduced 
water flows into the Salton Sea have 
led to deteriorating water quality and 
toxic dust that threatens local commu-
nities’ health. 
My bill will authorize $250 million 
the Bureau of Reclamation can spend 
on the Salton Sea and expand the types 
of transformative projects at the sea. 
This will ultimately strengthen our 
all-hands-on-deck approach to this en-
vironmental and public health crisis by 
expanding the bureau’s ability to work 
with State, local, and Tribal partners 
in the area. 
I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass 
this drought and wildfire bill, and I 
urge the Senate to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind all Members to re-
frain from references to guests on the 
floor. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Montana (Mr. ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, as 
it stands now, this bill will make a 
vast swath of land inaccessible, making 
it harder for wildfires to respond. 
This bill’s approach to wildfires is 
backwards. The people of Montana and 
across the West have seen too many 
fires scorch homes, businesses, and for-
ests. It has destroyed air quality, water 
quality, and fisheries. They appreciate 
the bravery of the responding fire-
fighters, but I believe many would pre-
fer never to see the wildfires in the 
first place. 
My amendment would have addressed 
root causes of wildfires by clarifying 
language in statute that allows radical 
environmentalists to delay the harvest 
of timber as per the Cottonwood deci-
sion, which has made proper forest 
management near impossible. 
The Cottonwood decision has delayed 
forest planning, wildfire mitigation ef-
forts, and ultimately weaponized the 
Endangered Species Act, allowing spe-
cial interest groups to line up like pigs 
at the trough, lapping up legal fees and 
settlements, 
stripping 
valuable 
re-
sources from agencies and keeping 
them from carrying out their mission. 
In closing, I will say that I am ap-
palled that Democrats will not con-
sider the commonsense amendments 
like mine, which would allow these 
mitigation efforts to take place. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr. PANETTA), 
who has become a real leader here in 
our caucus and in the Congress on for-
estry and forest management. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Chair, I rise 
today in support of the Wildfire Re-
sponse and Drought Resiliency Act. 
Let me, of course, thank Representa-
tive NEGUSE for his strong leadership 
on these issues, as well as Leader 
HOYER for getting this bill to the floor. 
I also acknowledge and understand 
my good friend Mr. WESTERMAN’s com-
plaints about regular order, but I also 
know that he understands how urgent 
of action is needed, especially when it 
comes to us getting a grip on the con-
flagrations, the devastation, and the 
destruction that we are experiencing in 
the American West when it comes to 
wildfires. 
Right now we have a record drought 
that has led to record levels of dryness. 
Dead and dying fuels have created vast 
swaths of wilderness that are flam-
mable, ignitable, and combustible just 
from a single spark, a simple downed 
power line, a smoldering campfire, or a 
strike of lightning that can absolutely 
wipe out not just our forests and our 
parks, but lives and livelihoods. 
This legislation contains a number of 
bills that would help reduce that 
threat, including my Save Our Forests 
Act that would authorize the Forest 
Service to hire more employees to help 
manage not just forests but the people 
who visit our forests. 
Eighty 
percent 
of 
wildfires 
are 
caused by humans, so more Forest 
Service personnel are needed to man-
age humans acting like humans. 
Additionally, the Wildfire Emergency 
Safety Act, which I authored with Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN, provides a strategy and 
the authority to start thinning out the 
undergrowth of overgrown forests and 
then set prescribed burns to eliminate 
those dead and dying fuels. 
This bill would do that at the na-
tional level with large-scale restora-
tion projects, and it would do that at 
the local level with non-Federal lands 
through partnerships with our Federal 
stakeholders. 
Let me also make one thing clear to 
our environmental allies. This is not a 
slippery slope to clear-cutting or com-
mercial logging. This is not about tim-
ber harvesting for economic interests. 
This is about smart, science-based, 
commonsensical stewardship for our 
forests. It is a solution to deal with our 
drought and a strategy to not just sup-
press wildfires, but, also, to do every-
thing we can to prevent them. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Chair, last 
year, my home State of California ex-
perienced the worst year for wildfires 
in the entire history of the State. 
As of this morning, the Oak Fire is 
burning just outside my district. It has 
consumed over 100 homes and displaced 
tens of thousands of people. 
Science tells us that the only way to 
reduce the intensity of these wildfires 
is to reduce the density of the fuels 
through either mechanical thinning or 
prescribed burns. But unfortunately, 
this bill makes the situation even 
worse by locking up over 58 million 
new acres of forest with a wilderness 
designation that would prevent the use 
of mechanical thinning or prescribed 
burns to reduce the density of the 
fuels. 
This bill is called the Wildfire Re-
sponse Act, but, Madam Chair, our re-
sponse to wildfires cannot be to take 
actions that make future wildfires even 
more destructive. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I 
thank the distinguished 
gentleman 
from Colorado for yielding, and I thank 
this body for recognizing the cruciality 
of where we are today as it relates to 
fires. 
I know the gentleman’s territory, but 
many people might not know that 
Texas also is impacted by wildfires. So, 
I rise in strong support for H.R. 5118, 
the Wildfire Response and Drought Re-
siliency Act for many reasons. 
One, I support my firefighters. As 
anyone has seen firefighters who fight 
these fires being interviewed, they are 
in the midst of the fire. As anyone has 
heard the families that look and say 
there is nothing here; but for fire-
fighters, I would not be here. 
So Houston is no stranger to these 
weather conditions. Fifty-one trillion 
gallons of water fell from Hurricane 
Harvey, yet wildfires are another type 
of extreme weather that imperils our 
community, and it is attributable to 
climate change, as Hurricane Harvey 
was. 
Wildfires are often unplanned fires, 
which burn in a natural area such as a 
forest. Along with the destruction and 
loss of forests caused by blazes, there 
are immediate and long-term environ-
mental impacts that dramatically af-
fect vital resources. Expanded areas of 
high-severity fire can impact tree re-
generation, soil erosion, and water 
quality, and, yes, the quality of life. It 
can cause major destruction of prop-
erty and loss of life, and this legisla-
tion is a recognition of attempting to 
address this question and address it 
now. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
this bill would boost pay and benefits 
for firefighters, help the U.S. Forest 
Service fill gaps in fire management 
staff, 
expand 
forest 
management 
projects, and reduce hazardous fuels. 
I ask my colleagues to support the 
underlying bill. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5118, 
also known as the Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act.

July 29, 2022 
Climate change is the most important exis-
tential challenge of our lifetime. It is not simply 
an issue, but a threat with credible and un-
compromising dangers to our world. 
Climate change degrades living conditions, 
human security, and our government’s ability 
to meet the basic needs of their populations. 
For too many years, we have heard warn-
ings from scientists regarding the danger to 
people if nothing is done to reverse the 
amounts of greenhouse gases released into 
the atmosphere. 
One of the most devastating consequences 
of climate change is the frequency and inten-
sity of extreme weather disasters. 
Houston is no stranger to these intense 
weather incidents. On August 25, 2017, Hurri-
cane Harvey, a Category 4 storm hit Texas, 
causing $125 billion in damages and affecting 
over 13 million people from Texas through 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ken-
tucky. 
Climatologists agree that global warming 
contributed to Hurricane Harvey’s impact. 
Studies found the amount of rainfall was be-
tween 15 to 38 percent higher because of 
global warming. 
Rising sea levels as a result of climate 
change also made flooding more likely near 
Gulf Coast cities. The sea levels around Hous-
ton were six inches higher than 20 years ago. 
This is partly because warmer global tempera-
tures have been melting the ice caps in Ant-
arctica. They have been shrinking at 1.6 me-
ters per year, compared to 3.8 centimeters an-
nually before 1992. 
Global warming also stalled weather pat-
terns in the region. That allowed Harvey to 
hover over Houston instead of moving back 
out into the ocean. 
Wildfires are another type of extreme weath-
er event that imperils many regions of the 
country. Wildfires are often unplanned fires 
which burn in a natural area such as a forest, 
grassland or prairie. They have devastating 
consequences on a region by decimating an 
environment, while weakening a community’s 
health and economy. 
Along with the destruction and loss of forest 
caused by blazes, there are immediate and 
long-term environmental impacts that dramati-
cally affect vital resources. Expanded areas of 
high-severity fire can impact tree regeneration, 
soil erosion, and water quality. 
Wildfires can affect the physical, chemical, 
and biological quality of streams, rivers, lakes 
and reservoirs. These changes are noticeable 
for years and even decades after a fire. 
The smoke from wildfires can cause eye 
and respiratory tract irritation and in more se-
vere cases, reduced lung function, bronchitis, 
and an exacerbation of asthma and heart fail-
ure. Air pollution can spread up to thousands 
of miles away, not just in the surrounding re-
gion. 
Property loss and damage is another con-
sequence of wildfires. In 2020 alone, fires in 
the U.S. caused $21.9 billion in property dam-
age. What’s more, eight of the 10 costliest 
wildfires ever in the U.S. have taken place in 
the past five years. 
Climate change exacerbates these condi-
tions. Long periods of record high tempera-
tures as a result of climate change intensify 
droughts that contribute to dry conditions and 
drive wildfires, which, in turn, reinforce the 
cycle of environmental peril. 
Wildfire risk depends on a number of factors 
such as temperature, soil moisture, and the 
presence of trees, shrubs, and other potential 
fuel. All these factors have strong direct or in-
direct ties to climate variability and climate 
change. 
Climate change enhances the drying of or-
ganic matter in forests (the material that burns 
and spreads wildfire) and has doubled the 
number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 
in the western United States. 
The stress that extreme weather is placing 
on the nation cannot be understated. 
H.R. 5118 would boost pay and benefits for 
firefighters, help the U.S. Forest Service fill 
gaps in fire management staff, and expand 
forest management projects to reduce haz-
ardous fuels. 
The provisions and purpose of this bill are 
not new. Historically, Congress has made nu-
merous investments to fight drought, wildfire 
and the climate crisis. 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, passed in 
November 2021, dedicated $7.81 billion under 
Title VIII to the DOI and the Forest Service to 
reduce wildfire risk and support ecosystem 
restoration. In total, the bill allotted $3.369 bil-
lion aimed at reducing wildfire risks. This 
amount was allocated to supporting fire-
fighters, research dedicated to risk mapping, 
satellite wildfire detection, etc. 
The measure would provide $1.6 billion in 
annual spending on firefighter salaries and ex-
penses at the Forest Service, and just under 
$2.4 billion annually for salaries and expenses 
for forest stewardship and management in the 
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
Forest management projects, which mainly 
involve reducing hazardous fuels such as 
dead trees, are part of the bill, authorizing 
$500 million annually for that purpose. The 
Department of Agriculture would select up to 
20 large, landscape-scale restoration projects 
over five years. 
H.R. 5118 represents a continuation of bi-
partisan efforts to support the reduction of 
wildfire risk. It is essential in order to protect 
communities 
from 
the 
devastating 
con-
sequences of wildfires and to actively fight 
against the impending climate crisis. The pro-
visions within H.R. 5118 are essential to the 
protection of our ecosystems and to the brave 
first responders who are tasked with wildfire 
recovery efforts. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5118. 
I include in the RECORD ‘‘North Texas 
wildfire continues to grow amid high 
heat’’ and ‘‘Bottle-magnified sunlight 
ignited paper and started a 500-acre 
Texas wildfire, officials say.’’ 
[From ABC News, July 19, 2022)] 
NORTH TEXAS WILDFIRE CONTINUES TO GROW 
AMID HIGH HEAT 
GRAFORD, TEXAS.—A North Texas wildfire 
continued to grow Tuesday amid sweltering 
temperatures and dry conditions after burn-
ing at least a dozen structures, officials said. 
The Chalk Mountain Fire about 50 miles 
(80 kilometers) southwest of Fort Worth was 
the largest active Texas wildfire as of Tues-
day afternoon after blackening 6,000 acres 
(2,400 hectares), an increase from 4,000 acres 
(1,600 hectares) Tuesday morning, the Texas 
A&M Forest Service said. The fire, which 
began Monday afternoon, was just 10% con-
tained, and crews using bulldozers were 
digging containment lines while fire trucks 
and 
aircraft 
worked 
to 
extinguish 
the 
flames, the Forest Service said. 
Late Tuesday afternoon, Hood County 
Judge Ron Massingill ordered the mandatory 
evacuation of a rural area south of Tolar, 
about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of 
Fort Worth. 
It was not yet clear how many, if any, of 
the 12 structures lost as of Tuesday after-
noon were residences or businesses, Forest 
Service spokeswoman Mary Leathers said. 
Meanwhile, crews continued to battle a 
wildfire that has burned at least 10 struc-
tures, five of them homes, around a lake in 
North Texas, authorities said. 
The fire at Possum Kingdom Lake about 70 
miles (113 kilometers) west of Fort Worth, 
which began Monday afternoon, had burned 
about 500 acres (202 hectares) and was 10% 
contained Tuesday, Forest Service spokes-
man Adam Turner said. Firefighting crews 
were working around the clock, focusing on 
protecting threatened homes in resort sub-
divisions along the lake’s western shore. 
The area remained under a voluntary evac-
uation notice, the Forest Service said. 
No injuries have been reported from the 
fires, and their causes were under investiga-
tion. A combination of near-record- and 
record-high temperatures approaching 110 
degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) com-
bined with breezes gusting as high as 30 mph 
(40–50 kph) and drought conditions leave the 
region ripe for fire, the forest service said. 
The National Weather Service has issued a 
red flag fire warning for northern and cen-
tral Texas and western and eastern Okla-
homa for Tuesday. 
‘‘We are experiencing dry fuels to a level 
that we haven’t seen in the past 10 years,’’ 
Turner said. ‘‘Any spark that lands in tall 
grass or even lands in some short grass right 
now is liable to spark.’’ 
Wildfires and intense heat in Texas and 
some other parts of the United States come 
as unusually hot, dry weather has gripped 
large swaths of Europe since last week, trig-
gering wildfires from Portugal to the Bal-
kans and leading to hundreds of heat-related 
deaths. 
[From the Associated Press, July 28, 2022] 
BOTTLE-MAGNIFIED SUNLIGHT IGNITED PAPER 
AND STARTED A 5OO-ACRE TEXAS WILDFIRE, 
OFFICIALS SAY 
Sunlight magnified by glass bottles in an 
open garbage can ignite paper trash, starting 
a 500-acre North Texas wildfire that de-
stroyed five homes, fire officials said Thurs-
day. 
The July 18 fire on Possum Kingdom 
Lake’s western shore, about 70 miles west of 
Fort Worth, took eight days to fully contain. 
Chief Bonnie Watkins of the Possum King-
dom West Side Volunteer Fire Department 
found a trash can packed with party trash 
that included paper goods, food and numer-
ous glass bottles, according to a department 
statement Thursday. 
Watkins concluded that a wind gust opened 
the can lid, allowing sunlight magnified by 
the glass bottles to ignite the paper. The fire 
built rapidly until the fire spilled from the 
can and spread to nearby cedar trees, the 
statement said. 
Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Insur-
ance Council of Texas, a nonprofit insurance 
industry association, said he had never heard 
of such a freakish cause for a wildfire. 
‘‘A fire started in a trash can is one thing, 
but one caused by sunlight magnified by 
glass bottles? That’s a new one,’’ Johnson 
said. 
North Texas has been plagued by numerous 
explosive 
wildfires 
fostered 
by 
extreme 
drought conditions combined with tempera-
tures topping 100 degrees and wind gusts. 
Another fire that began the same day as 
the Possum Kingdom Lake fire continued to 
burn Thursday about 50 miles southwest of 
Fort Worth. However, a multi-agency fire-
fighting team continued to make slow by

steady progress in containing the Chalk 
Mountain Fire that has blackened 10 1/2 
square miles, destroyed 16 homes and dam-
aged five others. 
In a statement, team officials said crews 
had improved containment from 50% to 53% 
from Wednesday to Thursday and crews sup-
pressed a particularly stubborn portion of 
the fire with bulldozers Thursday. However, 
they also continued to strengthen fire lines 
and attack hotspots as conditions remained 
critically conducive to ignitions and spread-
ing. 
The cause of the Chalk Mountain Fire has 
not yet been determined. 
[From the Center for Climate and Energy 
Solutions, July 2, 2022] 
WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
Climate change has been a key factor in in-
creasing the risk and extent of wildfires in 
the Western United States. Wildfire risk de-
pends on a number of factors, including tem-
perature, soil moisture, and the presence of 
trees, shrubs, and other potential fuel. All 
these factors have strong direct or indirect 
ties to climate variability and climate 
change. Climate change enhances the drying 
of organic matter in forests (the material 
that burns and spreads wildfire), and has 
doubled the number of large fires between 
1984 and 2015 in the western United States. 
Research shows that changes in climate 
create warmer, drier conditions. Increased 
drought, and a longer fire season are boost-
ing these increases in wildfire risk. For 
much of the U.S. West, projections show that 
an average annual 1 degree C temperature in-
crease would increase the median burned 
area per year as much as 600 percent in some 
types of forests. In the Southeastern United 
States modeling suggests increased fire risk 
and a longer fire season, with at least a 30 
percent increase from 2011 in the area burned 
by lightning-ignited wildfire by 2060. 
Once a fire starts—more than 80 percent of 
U.S. wildfires are caused by people—warmer 
temperatures and drier conditions can help 
fires spread and make them harder to put 
out. Warmer, drier conditions also con-
tribute to the spread of the mountain pine 
beetle and other insects that can weaken or 
kill trees, building up the fuels in a forest. 
Land use and forest management also af-
fect wildfire risk. Changes in climate add to 
these factors and are expected to continue to 
increase the area affected by wildfires in the 
United States. 
Since 2000, 15 forest fires in the United 
States have caused at least $1 billion in dam-
ages each, mainly from the loss of homes and 
infrastructure, along with firefighting costs. 
The 2017 wildfire season was well above aver-
age, with deadly fires in California and 
throughout the West, including Montana, Or-
egon, and Washington state. The 2018 wild-
fire season went on to also break records as 
the deadliest and most destructive season on 
record in California. NOAA estimates the 
total costs of wildfires in 2017 and 2018 to be 
more than $40 billion. In 2019, wildfires 
caused an estimated $4.5 billion in damages 
in California and Alaska. Alaska’s record- 
breaking heat and dry conditions over the 
summer months set the conditions for the 
state’s historic wildfire season. In 2020, five 
of the six largest fires on record burned in 
California and Oregon saw historic levels of 
wildfire spread and damage. Wildfires across 
the West led to weeks-long periods of 
unhealthy air quality levels for millions of 
people. 
Wildfire can affect: 
Federal and State Budgets: 
U.S. Forest Service fire suppression ex-
penditures had increased from about 15 per-
cent of the agency’s appropriated budget to 
more than 50 percent in 2017. Nationwide 
suppression costs in 2017 and 2018 ballooned 
to $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion respectively, 
while state wildfire expenditures have also 
increased substantially. 
Public Health: 
The growing number of people in wild 
lands is increasing the risk to life, property 
and public health. Smoke reduces air quality 
and can cause eye and respiratory illness, es-
pecially among children and the elderly. 
Wildfires that burn in residential areas can 
melt plastic water pipes and cause contami-
nation of water systems with a known car-
cinogen. 
Natural Environment: 
Wildfires are a natural part of many eco-
systems. Although wildfires produce a num-
ber of greenhouse gases and aerosols includ-
ing carbon dioxide, methane, and black car-
bon, the plants that re-colonize burned areas 
remove carbon from the atmosphere, gen-
erally leading to a net neutral effect on cli-
mate. However, when fires burn more fre-
quently and consume larger areas, as they 
are doing with climate change, the released 
greenhouse gases may not be completely re-
moved from the atmosphere if plants can’t 
grow to maturity before burning, or if the 
plants that re-colonize are less efficient at 
carbon uptake. 
HOW TO BUILD RESILIENCE 
Communities, builders, homeowners, and 
forest managers can reduce the likelihood 
and impacts of wildfires by: 
Discouraging developments (especially res-
idential) near fire-prone forests through 
smart zoning rules. 
Increasing the space between structures 
and nearby trees and brush, and clearing 
space between neighboring houses. 
Incorporating fire-resistant design features 
and materials in buildings. 
Increasing resources allocated to fire-
fighting and fire prevention. 
Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from 
forests that are at risk. 
Developing recovery plans before a fire 
hits, and implementing plans quickly after a 
fire to reduce erosion, limit flooding, and 
minimize habitat damage. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Chair, Oregon, 
Idaho, California, New Mexico; the 
Western United States is on fire. We 
need to do something now. The folks 
here probably remember last year when 
we looked out the window here in D.C., 
we saw smoke going over the top of 
this town and that was Oregon or what 
used to be part of Oregon. 
If we are going to avoid that, we need 
to do something now. To delay is to de-
stroy. This bill, sadly, should be called 
the delay bill. Why? Because built into 
it throughout are obstacles to getting 
back into the forests. Obstacles in the 
form of foundations for litigation of all 
sorts, all types, and what we engage in 
then is paralysis through litigation. 
This 
bill 
creates 
numerous 
new 
means of delaying getting back into 
the woods. We cannot afford to do this. 
To delay is to destroy. This bill needs 
to be opposed. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Chair, in Sep-
tember of 2020, as the El Dorado fire 
raged through California, Big Bear hot-
shot firefighter Charlie Morton said to 
his loved ones what he always said 
when there was a fire in the area: ‘‘I’ve 
got to go protect my mountains.’’ 
Hotshots like Morton serve in the 
Vanguard. They are tasked with mak-
ing the area safe for other firefighters 
to operate. As one hotshot explained: 
‘‘We do not get to turn around and 
walk away.’’ 
I am hopeful that the Congress today 
does not turn around and walk away. 
This bill is a step to deal with the ex-
traordinary consequences of climate 
change that is afflicting our country. 
Yes, it is the West of our country, but 
it is afflicting us all, in particularly, 
the West. 
Firefighter Morton knew his work 
was extremely dangerous, but he did it 
anyway because he believed in the im-
portance of protecting our Nation’s for-
ests and the communities they sustain. 
On September 17, 2020, backed into a 
corner by the encroaching flames, Mor-
ton laid down his life in defense of that 
conviction. It was a noble sacrifice but 
one that no one should have to make. 
Much like Morton and his fellow hot-
shots, America cannot afford to turn 
around and walk away from the issue 
of wildfires. 
We must do everything we can to en-
sure that other brave firefighters do 
not have to give the full measure of 
their devotion as Morton did. That is 
why I am proud to serve as co-chair of 
the Congressional Fire Service Caucus 
and to bring this Wildfire Response and 
Drought Resiliency Act to the floor 
today. 
Exacerbated, as we know, by the cli-
mate crisis, parts of the American 
West 
are 
experiencing 
the 
worst 
drought in 1,200 years, and this is fuel-
ing deadly and damaging wildfires af-
fecting millions of Americans. 
These disasters, Madam Chair, tear 
through communities and inflict un-
told destruction and grief. 
This issue doesn’t just affect those 
living in the West, however. As I have 
said, 
the 
effects 
of 
drought 
and 
wildfires cost our country tens of bil-
lions of dollars each year. We all pay a 
price; not the price that Morton paid, 
but we pay a price. 
To my friends on the other side of 
the aisle who constantly deride our at-
tempts to address the climate crisis as 
too expensive, I would remind them 
that the cost of inaction in the form of 
more 
frequent, 
more 
severe 
fires, 
droughts, and other natural disasters is 
far greater. 
b 1245 
From time to time, I quote a former 
Governor of our State, Ted Agnew, 
who, in his inaugural address in 1967, 
on the east front of the capitol in An-
napolis, where I was just entering as a 
new State senator, said: ‘‘The cost of 
failure 
far 
exceeds 
the 
price 
of 
progress.’’ That is true here. 
We must not fail, and we must re-
spond. And we must respond effec-
tively.

H7429 
July 29, 2022 
This legislation will help us prevent 
and fight future wildfires by making 
investments to support our firefighting 
response and to protect vulnerable 
communities from wildfire. This bill, 
for instance, would establish a min-
imum basic pay of roughly $20 an hour 
for wildland firefighters and ensure 
they have access to other benefits, 
such as at least 1 week of mental 
health leave. 
Additionally, this legislation will au-
thorize a 10-year national wildfire re-
sponse plan, building on actions al-
ready taken by the Biden administra-
tion, and it will expand the role of 
Tribes and conservation corps pro-
grams in reducing wildfire risks. 
This bill, Madam Chair, also includes 
$500 million in Federal funding to pro-
grams to preserve key Colorado River 
reservoirs, an absolutely critical objec-
tive for us all. Tens of millions of 
Americans rely on that water. 
All of these provisions will help us 
build on the progress we made with the 
fire and drought protection measures, 
including the bipartisan infrastructure 
law, which included close to $17 billion 
for wildfire and drought prevention and 
response. 
As an aside, Madam Chair, I am told 
some say this is an authorizing bill. It 
is an authorizing bill. That is regular 
order. It will be our responsibility to 
then appropriate the funds that are 
necessary to carry out the objectives of 
this bill, and I hope we can do so in a 
bipartisan way. 
I thank House Natural Resources 
Committee Chairman RAU´ L GRIJALVA 
for his leadership and Mr. NEGUSE, the 
ranking member, as well, for the work 
that they have done. Whether they 
agree or not, there has been joint work 
on this bill. I thank Chairs DAVID 
SCOTT, FRANK PALLONE, EDDIE BERNICE 
JOHNSON, and CAROLYN
MALONEY
for 
their committees’ contributions. 
We can take meaningful action to ad-
dress these wildfires and drought by 
voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Madam Chair, although Charlie Mor-
ton perished in the El Dorado fire, his 
courageous efforts and those of his fel-
low firefighters made it possible to ex-
tinguish, ultimately, the flames. They 
were able to protect Morton’s moun-
tains, including a pristine meadow now 
named in his memory. 
They did their part to defend our for-
est 
and 
our 
communities. 
Today, 
Madam Chair, we must do our part. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Chair, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 5118, the so- 
called wildfire response package. 
The Greenwood fire in northern Min-
nesota was the worst in decades. It rav-
aged my district, forcing home evacu-
ations, closing the Boundary Waters, 
and upending people’s lives. Still, even 
worse wildfires ravage southern Cali-
fornia and across the West. 
Wildfires are the result of weather, 
topography, and fuel. Madam Chair, 
the only factor we can control is fuel. 
Our forests are thick with dead wood 
fuel, and they are, predictably, going 
up in flames. 
Real solutions include reforming our 
broken permitting process so we can 
get our loggers into forests on projects 
to really make a difference. There are 
no better conservationists and forest 
managers. They know better than any-
one how to preserve our forests for fu-
ture generations. 
Like everything done by this major-
ity, it throws money at a problem and 
offers no real solutions to ensure this 
doesn’t happen again. And, no, not one 
single wildland firefighter receives a 
raise under this bill. $20 an hour is al-
ready the minimum wage, and when 
you authorize no money with it, it will, 
in fact, lead to wildland firefighting 
jobs being cut. 
Republicans are offering solutions. 
Ranking Member WESTERMAN has the 
Trillion Trees Act. I have the ESA 
Flexibility Act and the Healthy For-
ests for Hunters Act. 
Madam Chair, Republicans will keep 
offering solutions until you accept 
them because we need to fix this prob-
lem. It cannot go on like this any 
longer. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, might I 
inquire how much time is remaining 
for the respective sides. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Col-
orado has 31⁄4 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Arkansas has 61⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Chair, I rise 
in support of the motion to recommit 
and in opposition to the underlying 
bill. 
The legislation before us today is 
rightly labeled a wildfire response bill. 
But, Madam Chair, I believe instead of 
just focusing on wildfire response, we 
as Congress should be focused on wild-
fire prevention. 
The most immediate way to protect 
Americans who are threatened by po-
tential catastrophic wildfire is to pre-
vent these fires from happening in the 
first place, and the only way to do this 
is to actively manage our forests. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to 
support my bill, the Wildfire Preven-
tion 
and 
Drought 
Mitigation 
Act, 
which is a part of this motion to re-
commit. This legislation would grant 
categorical exclusion authority for for-
est management projects whose pri-
mary purpose is to protect municipal 
water resources and to improve water-
shed 
health, 
water 
yield, 
and 
snowpack. 
In addition, projects that are specifi-
cally tailored to adapt a forest land-
scape to an increased threat of drought 
would be granted categorical exclusion 
authority. Granting categorical exclu-
sion authority to these projects would 
streamline the NEPA process and pro-
tect communities in my district that 
are adjacent to fire-prone forests. 
The underlying bill we are debating 
here today will make it more difficult 
to prevent wildfires by adding new red 
tape and locking up millions of acres in 
wilderness. This is the same approach 
and continues to hurt my constituents. 
Just a few months ago, the Black fire 
burned over 300,000 acres of mostly wil-
derness area in my district. In north-
ern New Mexico, the devastating Her-
mits Peak-Calf Canyon fire burned 
through the unmanaged Pecos Wilder-
ness and became the largest fire in our 
State history. These fires have de-
stroyed hundreds of homes and will 
cost New Mexicans millions of dollars 
to clean up the damage and rebuild. All 
of this was preventable. 
Instead of making it more difficult to 
prevent catastrophic wildfires, as the 
underlying bill would do, I ask my col-
leagues to support this motion to re-
commit. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
know the distinguished gentleman, Mr. 
HOYER, has left the Chamber, but I did 
want to personally thank him for put-
ting the Senate NEPA streamlining 
bill on the suspension calendar today. I 
hope we can work on more issues like 
that in the future. 
Madam Chair, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
VALADAO). 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Chair, my 
constituents have faced drought condi-
tions for years. Communities through-
out the Central Valley and the entire 
American West are running out of 
water for daily use in homes, busi-
nesses, 
and 
agriculture 
production. 
Farmers are being forced to fallow 
their fields and dry out their orchards, 
and hundreds of thousands of acres will 
be unable to be planted again this year. 
Instead of coming to the table to 
work on real solutions that would give 
families and farmers in my community 
the water they desperately need to sur-
vive, the majority has decided they 
would rather play politics with the 
most critical resource in the valley. 
Apparently, passing political mes-
saging bills to check a box is more im-
portant to my Democratic colleagues 
than trying to save the livelihood of 
thousands of valley farmers trying to 
put food on the tables of Americans 
across the country. 
This bill is completely silent on the 
desperate need for enhanced water 
storage infrastructure to better pre-
pare us during wet years. It does not 
cut red tape, decrease time delays, or 
address increased project costs due to 
redundant requirements under NEPA. 
The bottom line is this bill is bad 
policy and bad for the Central Valley. 
My colleagues don’t seem to under-
stand that the fewer agriculture prod-
ucts the Central Valley produces, the 
worse off our own domestic food supply 
will be. Reduced ag means more of a re-
liance on other nations for our food, 
which is an issue for national security. 
We must do better to address the se-
vere drought we are suffering through 
in the American West.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7430 
July 29, 2022 
The WIIN Act, which passed with bi-
partisan 
support 
under 
President 
Obama in 2016, provided real relief to 
valley farmers by increasing oper-
ational flexibility of the Central Valley 
Project and the California State Water 
Project. It also authorized millions of 
dollars for important water infrastruc-
ture projects to improve the Friant- 
Kern Canal, the Delta-Mendota Canal, 
and the California Aqueduct. 
The WIIN Act was critical to ensur-
ing that valley families in rural com-
munities across the United States have 
clean, reliable water. We made great 
progress because of this legislation. 
Unfortunately, authorities under the 
WIIN Act expired in 2021. 
This is why I introduced the RENEW 
WIIN Act, to extend storage and oper-
ation provisions of the WIIN Act and 
authorize funds for critical water stor-
age projects. 
Over three quarters of the Democrats 
in this House supported these positions 
in 2016. But this week, they refused to 
include 
my 
bill 
in 
this 
so-called 
drought relief package. They are block-
ing an actual solution to the crisis in 
the name of environmental justice. 
Madam Chair, where is the justice in 
letting thousands of valley farmers 
lose their livelihoods because they can-
not get something as basic as water? 
If this drought bill was truly about 
solving the water crisis in the West, 
the House majority would include the 
RENEW WIIN Act in this package in-
stead of actively blocking its consider-
ation. 
Madam Chair, I am once again urging 
the House majority to consider this 
legislation that will bring water to the 
people in my community doing every-
thing possible to survive this terrible 
drought. 
Madam Chair, I urge the Democrat 
majority to stop playing politics with 
the resource that the entire country is 
so reliant on. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
include 
in 
the 
RECORD the text of the amendment. 
At the end of division A, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 303. CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION FOR WILD-
FIRE PREVENTION AND DROUGHT 
MITIGATION. 
(a) CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION ESTABLISHED.— 
Forest management activities described in

TITLE IX—RENEW WIIN ACT 
SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Respon-
sible, No-Cost Extension of Western Water 
Infrastructure Improvements Act’’ or the 
‘‘RENEW WIIN Act’’. 
SEC. 902. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY. 
Subtitle J of the Water Infrastructure Im-
provements for the Nation Act (Public Law 
114–322) is amended— 
(1) in section 4007 (43 U.S.C. 390(b) note), in

ing ‘‘on December 31, 2036’’. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, 
may I inquire as to the time remaining 
on both sides. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Ar-
kansas has 1 minute remaining. The 
gentleman from Colorado has 31⁄4 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, I heard with great in-
terest my colleague from California’s 
remarks. I have to say I did take um-
brage with his characterization of the 
bills within this omnibus package, as I 
think he put it, as ‘‘political messaging 
bills.’’ 
I don’t think that Mr. LAMALFA, a 
Republican 
from 
California, 
would 
characterize 
his 
bill, 
the 
Tribal 
Biochar Promotion Act, as a political 
messaging bill. His bill is in this bill. 
I don’t think that Mr. MOORE, a Re-
publican of Utah, would characterize 
his bill, the Saline Lake Ecosystems in 
the Great Basin States Program Act, 
as a political messaging bill. His bill is 
in this bill. 
I don’t think that Ms. LOFGREN 
would 
characterize 
her 
bill, 
the 
Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act, as a 
political messaging bill. That bill is be-
fore the House today. 
That is probably the best place for 
me to begin to close. 
We have heard a lot from the other 
side about various mischaracteriza-
tion’s of firefighter pay and wildland 
firefighter pay and what this bill does 
and does not do. For the benefit of 
every American watching, I would en-
courage you to read the bill. 
This body approved a pay increase for 
wildland firefighters a year ago. All 
but 13 of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle voted against it. You 
can check the RECORD. That pay in-
crease expires a year from now. This 
bill seeks to make that pay increase 
permanent. 
One could only hope that my col-
leagues who have made much about ap-
propriating language will join me. I 
look forward to asking the ranking 
member after this vote to join me on

July 29, 2022 
the bill to appropriate the firefighter 
pay increase that this bill will author-
ize. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
A poet named Joyce Kilmer wrote his 
most famous poem called ‘‘Trees,’’ and 
it begins with, ‘‘I think that I shall 
never see a poem as lovely as a tree.’’ 
Trees and forests are poetic. They 
tug at our heartstrings. They evoke 
emotion. And I sincerely appreciate the 
emotion that my colleagues across the 
aisle have. I really believe we want to 
get to the same place of having healthy 
trees and healthy forests. 
It was that that motivated me to go 
to forestry school and study forestry. 
Little did I know that I would have the 
honor and the huge responsibility of 
standing on the floor of this august 
body and speaking for the trees. 
We want to do the right thing. We 
know how to do the right thing. We 
know how to take care of these trees 
and take care of these forests. 
Unfortunately, what is in this bill 
doesn’t do that. What is in this bill 
doesn’t help the water situation. We 
should not pass this bill. 
Let’s work together, come up with 
real solutions, pass them out of this 
House, and get them signed into law to 
help our forests, our firefighters, and 
our drought conditions. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, how 
much time do I have remaining. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. WATSON 
COLEMAN). The gentleman from Colo-
rado has 11⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Chair, I have great respect 
for the ranking member. We work to-
gether and have had rigorous and ro-
bust debates about forest management. 
We have partnered on some bills, and 
we have opposed each other’s respec-
tive positions on others. But the signs 
that the other side have been using 
during this debate about firefighter 
pay and the like are simply not true. 
I understand if my colleagues on the 
other side believe that the firefighter 
pay increase that is authorized by this 
bill and that makes the pay increases 
that were authorized last year perma-
nent, I understand if they believe that 
it is too expensive. They are welcome 
to make that argument. I disagree. 
But I hope that every Member of this 
Chamber can, again, adhere to sub-
stantive debate on the text of the bill 
that is before the House, and the text 
of this bill authorizes an increase for 
wildland firefighters who are bravely 
sacrificing so much for our country. It 
authorizes additional dollars for the 
Forest Service to do incredibly impor-
tant forest management work to pre-
vent the next fire in Colorado, in Utah, 
in New Mexico, and in Arizona. The bill 
authorizes significant investments to 
ensure that the drought we are experi-
encing at record levels in the West can 
be addressed. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5118, 
the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency 
Act. 
Our communities have been hit hard by 
wildfires year after year. During the 2017 wild-
fire season, 44 people were killed and nearly 
5,000 people lost their homes. Five years 
later, our communities are still rebuilding. 
We made significant investments in the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fight 
and prepare for wildfires. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act is another step towards providing 
our communities with the resources we need 
to combat wildfires and reduce drought. 
I am particularly pleased to see my lan-
guage requesting information from the Depart-
ment of Agriculture on crop losses due to nat-
ural disasters included in this bill. 
Given the prolonged drought conditions and 
the constant threat of wildfire and smoke ex-
posure, we already know that many of our 
growers will need disaster assistance for 2022 
losses. 
The information we request from USDA will 
help inform my work to reauthorize the Emer-
gency Relief Program for 2022 losses. 
This bill includes a crucial cost share adjust-
ment and establishes a minimum basic pay 
and hiring authorities for federal wildland fire-
fighters—providing necessary resources to 
those who put their lives on the line to save 
our lives and homes. 
This bill provides authorization for the pre- 
deployment of resources during red flag warn-
ings similar to how we prepare resources in 
advance of oncoming hurricanes. 
This bill also includes provisions from the 
FEED Act, legislation I was proud to introduce, 
allowing local restaurants to partner with the 
government to distribute healthy food to wild-
fire victims during their time of need. 
As we continue to address the climate cri-
sis, I will continue to do everything I can to en-
sure our communities have the resources they 
need to prevent and recover from the fires that 
continue to threaten our homes and liveli-
hoods every year. 
I urge a yes vote on this bill. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Chair, studies show 
that when our environmental laws are broken 
our poorest communities disproportionately 
pay the price. Communities such as Globeville 
and Elyria-Swansea—two predominantly His-
panic neighborhoods in my district—are being 
inundated by the pollution coming from the 
highways, railyard and industrial plants around 
them. 
The problem is: While EPA monitors each of 
these sources individually, they don’t consider 
the cumulative health impact that all of these 
sources combined can have on nearby resi-
dents. 
The legislation I included in this bill will 
change that. It will require EPA, for the first 
time, to address the cumulative effect of mul-
tiple sources of nearby pollution. It will also re-
quire EPA to identify 100 of the most heavily 
polluted communities in the country and en-
sure the laws put in place to protect them are 
being enforced. 
Ensuring ‘‘Environmental Justice’’ for all 
Americans needs to be more than just a 
catchphrase, it should be our collective mis-
sion. I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Natural Resources, 
printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of 
the text of Rules Committee Print 117– 
57, modified by the amendment printed 
in part B of House Report 117–432, shall 
be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as the original bill for the purpose 
of further amendment under the 5-

share that is in the form of cash contributions; 
(D) whether the area covered by the project 
has high-resolution, remote-sensing data and 
other information available that enables a land-
scape assessment and a robust analysis and dis-
closure of the effects and outcomes of imple-
menting restoration activities; 
(E) whether the project is using, or will use, 
innovative approaches to completing resource 
surveys that are less costly and less time-con-
suming than usual practices while providing the 
information necessary for project design and 
analysis; 
(F) whether the project will reduce the num-
ber of miles of permanent roads on National 
Forest System land that are not necessary for 
resource management or recreational access; 
(G) whether the project will assess or quantify 
the ecosystem service benefits of forest restora-
tion within the landscape covered by the 
project, such as water, carbon, biodiversity, fire 
risk reduction, public health, and community 
safety;

support local employment and investment oppor-
tunities, particularly in economically disadvan-
taged communities; 
(J) the scale of the landscape assessment for 
the project, with a preference for projects for 
which the landscape assessment covers a larger 
area; and 
(K) whether the project— 
(i) strives to restore ecological integrity and 
ecological conditions within areas across land 
ownerships, including State and private land; 
and 
(ii) will reduce the risk of uncharacteristic 
wildfire, and, to the extent practicable, restore

that may reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of 
loss due to wildfires. 
(C) A discussion of how the Agency may opti-
mize relocation assistance when entire States or 
geographic areas are considered subject to a fire 
risk. 
(D) An analysis of whether other mitigation 
measures are more cost-effective than relocation 
assistance when the applicant is applying to 
move from a high-risk to a medium-risk or low-

(E) An analysis of the need for the Federal 
Government to produce wildfire maps that iden-
tify high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk wild-
fire zones.

measures promote greater resilience to wildfires 
when compared to relocation or, if additional 
data is required in order to carry out such an 
analysis, a discussion of the additional data re-
quired. 
(G) A discussion of the ability of States, local

lations regarding relocation assistance by the 
Agency present barriers for States, local govern-
ments, or Indian tribal governments trying to 
access funding to reduce wildfire risk.

(i) how, if at all, the Agency has modified 
policies and procedures to determine the eligi-
bility of proposed relocation or mitigation

Board, which shall be an independent establish-
ment, as defined in section 104 of title 5, United 
States Code. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of the Board 
are— 
(1) to reduce loss of life, injury, and economic 
injury caused by future incidents by learning 
from natural hazards, including the impacts 
and underlying factors of such incidents, in a 
standardized way; 
(2) to maintain a focus that is future-looking 
and national in scope, by applying what the 
Board learns through the trends that emerge 
from the incidents the Board reviews nationally 
to prevent loss of life, or human or economic in-
jury, not only in the affected jurisdiction, but 
nationally, as the Board determines relevant; 
(3) in carrying out reviews, analyses, and rec-

of life and human or economic injury in inci-
dents, including by recommending the aug-
mentation of resources available to entities re-
sponsible for managing incident consequences;

of the mission of the Board, when relevant, to 
prioritize efforts that focus on lifesaving and in-
jury prevention, especially in disproportionately 
impacted communities, as its work determines 
them to be.

INCIDENT 
WARRANTS
BOARD
REVIEW.—In carrying out 
subsection (a), the Board— 
(1) may begin the review of an incident, in-
cluding by monitoring the natural hazard and 
collecting facts, before the total number of fa-
talities is known if the Board determines that 
the natural hazard incident has the potential to 
cause 10 or more fatalities at its onset, in ac-
cordance with the policies and procedures estab-
lished by the Board;

ance regulators, shall conduct a study to ana-
lyze and determine the following: 
(1) EXISTING STATE OF COVERAGE.—With re-
spect to the existing state of homeowners insur-
ance coverage and commercial property insur-
ance coverage for damage from wildfires in the 
United States— 
(A) the extent to which private insurers have, 
during the 10-year period ending on the date of 
the enactment of this Act, increased rates, cost- 
sharing provisions, or both for such coverage 
(after adjusting for inflation) and the geo-
graphic areas in which such increased rates, 
cost-sharing, or both applied; 
(B) the extent to which private insurers have, 
during the 10-year period ending on the date of 
the enactment of this Act, refused to renew poli-
cies for such coverages and the geographic areas 
to which such refusals applied; 
(C) the events that have triggered such in-
creased rates and refusals to renew policies; 
(D) in cases in which private insurers curtail 
coverage, the extent to which homeowners cov-
erage and commercial property coverage are ter-
minated altogether and the extent to which such 
coverages are offered but with coverage for dam-
age from wildfires excluded; and 
(E) the extent to which, and circumstances 
under which, private insurers are continuing to 
provide coverage for damage from wildfires— 
(i) in general; 
(ii) subject to a condition that mitigation ac-
tivities are taken, such as hardening of prop-
erties and landscaping against wildfires, by 
property owners, State or local governments, 
park or forest authorities, or other land man-
agement authorities; and 
(iii) subject to any other conditions. 
(2) REGULATORY RESPONSES.—With respect to 
actions taken by State insurance regulatory 
agencies in response to increased premium rates, 
cost-sharing, or both for coverage for damage 
from wildfires and exclusion of such coverage 
from homeowners policies—

owners coverage to include coverage for damage 
from wildfires or make sales of homeowners cov-
erage contingent on the sale, underwriting, or 
financing of separate wildfire coverage in the 
State; 
(D) the extent to which States have estab-
lished State residual market insurance entities, 
reinsurance programs, or similar mechanisms for 
coverage of damages from wildfires; 
(E) any other actions States or localities have 
taken in response to increased premium rates, 
cost-sharing, or both for coverage for damage 
from wildfires and exclusion of such coverage 
from homeowners policies, including forestry 
and wildfire management policies and subsidies 
for premiums and cost-sharing for wildfire cov-
erage; 
(F) the effects on the homeownership coverage 
market of such actions taken by States; and

RISK.—With respect to impediments faced by pri-
vate insurers underwriting wildfire risk, what is 
or are—

risks; 
(B) the extent of private insurers’ inability to 
estimate magnitude of future likelihood of 
wildfires 
and 
of 
expected 
damages 
from 
wildfires; 
(C) the extent to which need for affordable 
housing contributes to people relocating to more 
remote, heavily wooded areas with higher wild-
fire risk; 
(D) the potential for wildfire losses suffi-
ciently large to jeopardize insurers’ solvency; 
(E) the extent to which, and areas in which, 
risk-adjusted market premiums for wildfire risk 
are so high as to be unaffordable; 
(F) the manners in which the Federal Govern-
ment and State governments can alleviate any 
of these impediments, including through— 
(i) improved forest management policies to re-
duce wildfire risk; 
(ii) improved data to estimate risk; 
(iii) relocating homeowners from wildfire 
zones; 
(iv) allowing insurers to charge risk-adjusted 
premiums for wildfire risk, combined with sub-
sidized premiums for lower-income homeowners; 
and 
(v) taking a last-loss position in reinsuring 
wildfire risk; 
(G) the available policy responses if private 
insurers exit the wildfire coverage market and 
the advantages and disadvantages of each such 
response; 
(H) the effects of lack of wildfire coverage or 
more expensive wildfire coverage rates, cost- 
sharing, or both— 
(i) on local communities, including on low- or 
moderate-income property owners and small 
businesses; 
(ii) by race and ethnicity; 
(iii) on rebuilding in communities previously 
damaged by wildfires; and

(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.—The 
term ‘‘environmental impact statement’’ means 
the detailed statement of environmental impacts 
of a proposed action required to be prepared 
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). 
(2) FEDERAL ACTION.—The term ‘‘Federal ac-
tion’’ means a proposed action that requires the

OF
A COMMUNITY IMPACT 
REPORT.—A Federal agency proposing to take a 
Federal action that has the potential to cause 
negative environmental or public health impacts 
on an environmental justice community shall 
prepare a community impact report assessing 
the potential impacts of the proposed action. 
(d) CONTENTS.—A community impact report 
described in subsection (c) shall— 
(1) assess the degree to which a proposed Fed-
eral action affecting an environmental justice 
community will cause multiple or cumulative ex-
posure to human health and environmental haz-
ards that influence, exacerbate, or contribute to 
adverse health outcomes; 
(2) assess relevant public health data and in-
dustry data concerning the potential for mul-
tiple or cumulative exposure to human health or 
environmental hazards in the area of the envi-
ronmental justice community and historical pat-
terns of exposure to environmental hazards and 
Federal agencies shall assess these multiple, or 
cumulative effects, even if certain effects are not 
within the control or subject to the discretion of 
the Federal agency proposing the Federal ac-
tion; 
(3) assess the impact of such proposed Federal 
action on such environmental justice commu-
nity’s ability to access public parks, outdoor 
spaces, and public recreation opportunities; 
(4) evaluate alternatives to or mitigation 
measures for the proposed Federal action that 
will— 
(A) eliminate or reduce any identified expo-
sure to human health and environmental haz-
ards described in paragraph (1) to a level that is 
reasonably expected to avoid human health im-
pacts in environmental justice communities; and 
(B) not negatively impact an environmental 
justice community’s ability to access public 
parks, outdoor spaces, and public recreation op-
portunities; and

particular program, policy, practice, or activity 
does not cause a disparate impact, the covered 
entity shall demonstrate that each particular 
challenged program, policy, practice, or activity 
does not cause a disparate impact, except that if 
the covered entity demonstrates to the courts

sion-making process are not capable of separa-
tion for analysis, the decision-making process 
may be analyzed as 1 program, policy, practice, 
or activity. 
‘‘(2) A demonstration that a program, policy, 
practice, or activity is necessary to achieve the 
goals of a program, policy, practice, or activity 
may not be used as a defense against a claim of

tion or practice that, even if appearing neutral, 
actually has the effect of subjecting persons to 
discrimination on the basis of their race, color, 
or national origin. 
‘‘(C) No person in the United States shall be 
subjected to discrimination, including retalia-
tion or intimidation, because such person op-
posed any program, policy, practice, or activity

pated in any manner in an investigation, pro-
ceeding, or hearing under this title.’’.

DISCRIMINATION.—In an action brought by an

supply drinking water to rural communities 
in which a significant number of dwellings 
with private drinking water wells have wells

from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
rise in support of the amendment. 
Madam Chair, Leader MCCARTHY’s 
amendment presents a commonsense 
solution. As he knows all too well from 
his efforts resolving water issues, com-
munities in California and elsewhere in 
the West are running out of water for 
families, 
farms, 
communities, 
and 
many other needs thanks to natural 
and manmade drought. 
This has a dramatic impact not only 
to those areas, but it negatively im-
pacts food production which affects 
every one of us. In the case of some 
California communities, wells that are 
used to provide drinking water have or 
will run dry. 
This amendment seeks to provide 
some 
relief 
to 
rural 
communities 
through the creation of a new grant 
program aimed at constructing new 
wells and waterlines designed to de-
liver drinking water to these commu-
nities. I thank Leader MCCARTHY for 
introducing this amendment and for 
his longstanding leadership on bringing 
balance back to western water policies. 
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I ask 
unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, even though I am not 
necessarily opposed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. I would simply say, 
Madam Chair, in the spirit of biparti-
sanship—which I think has been reflec-
tive of so many of the bills that are in-
cluded within this important and crit-
ical package that has been brought to 
the floor today—that I appreciate the 
arguments that were made with re-
spect to this particular amendment. I 
imagine that Members are going to 
consider it thoughtfully and make a 
judgment that is in the best interests 
of their constituents and their respec-
tive States on this particular amend-
ment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s kind words 
about the amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CONWAY). 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Chair, I rise 
today in support of this amendment 
that I coauthored. 
In my home, California’s Central Val-
ley, communities are running out of 
clean water, we would consider drink-
ing water. They are unable to shower, 
unable to cook for their families, and 
unable to stay cool during intense 
heat. 
Madam Chair, the thought of having 
to bathe your children, cook food, and 
to stay alive with small bottles of 
water, that is the gist of this amend-
ment. 
Extreme drought and outdated water 
infrastructure have forced small, rural 
communities to truck in water every 
day. This amendment authorizes $250 
million in grants to improve water ac-
cess for small rural communities suf-
fering from drinking water shortages. 
My amendment is supported by small 
communities, 
local 
nonprofits, 
and 
those dedicated to helping underserved 
communities like Self-Help Enterprises 
and the Tulare County Board of Super-
visors. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
include 
in 
the 
RECORD a letter from Self-Help Enter-
prises. 
SELF-HELP ENTERPRISES, 
July 26, 2022. 
Re Conway/McCarthy Amendment to H.R. 
5118, Wildfire Response and Drought Re-
siliency Act. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader of the US House of Representa-
tives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. CONNIE CONWAY, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MINORITY
LEADER
MCCARTHY
AND 
REPRESENTATIVE CONWAY: I am writing on 
behalf of Self-Help Enterprises to extend our 
support for your amendment to the Wildfire 
Response and Drought Resiliency Act (H.R. 
5118). The McCarthy/Conway amendment will 
provide much-needed funding to facilitate 
drought resiliency and water system consoli-
dations. 
This amendment ensures access to funding 
to augment water supplies by larger water 
systems who extend water service to smaller 
disadvantaged communities. It will also 
allow them to cover the costs of service ex-
tension. One example of this need is found in 
Tulare County, California, where Self-Help 
Enterprises has been working with the com-
munity of Tooleville (population 500) to con-
nect to the City of Exeter’s water system 
(population 10,400). Exeter, while an incor-
porated city with a mid-sized population, is 
still small and lacks the resources or legal 
authority to spend City funds on the water 
system consolidation project. Meanwhile, 
Tooleville’s small water system is struggling 
with the effects of drought and overpumping 
of groundwater by surrounding uses, and its 
two wells (drilled in the 1970s) fail on a reg-
ular basis. For that reason, Self-Help Enter-
prises has installed temporary storage tanks 
and is hauling water to fill these tanks on an 
as-needed basis. 
It’s important that cities and larger com-
munities can access this type of funding re-
gardless of their own population size, so that 
they can work in good conscience to help 
their neighbors without jeopardizing the 
well-being of their own residents. 
Therefore, we urge the adoption of the 
Conway/McCarthv amendment to H.R. 5118 
by the House of Representatives. We thank 
you for your attention to the needs of the 
rural communities of the San Joaquin Val-
ley. For questions or more information, 
please don’t hesitate to contact Jessi Snyder 
of our staff. 
Sincerely, 
THOMAS J. COLLISHAW, 
President/CEO. 
Ms. CONWAY. While there are many 
more issues to be addressed in the larg-
er bill, this will directly help rural 
Americans in critical need of assist-
ance and underserved members of our 
communities. 
Madam Chair, I urge Members to sup-
port this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The requests will 
be covered by a subsequent request for 
general leave. 
The gentleman from Colorado is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I cer-
tainly appreciate the gentlewoman’s 
support, her attention, and her descrip-
tion about the need for funding to help 
rural communities recover from nat-
ural disasters and emergencies. I cer-
tainly share the desire to ensure that 
rural communities have access to clean 
and reliable drinking water. 
I am looking forward to the House 
considering Mr. MCCARTHY’s amend-
ment as well as the many Republican 
bills and bipartisan bills that are in-
cluded within this Wildfire Response 
and Drought Resiliency Act. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, 
this is a commonsense, good amend-
ment that the leader has offered. I urge 
its adoption, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1254, the gentle-
woman from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, we are seeing increas-
ingly catastrophic wildfires in the 
West, including in my home State of 
Washington. Last year, more than 
50,000 acres burned in just one of the 
counties in the Eighth District that I 
represent. This was a record-breaking 
wildfire season with abnormally dry 
conditions. But this type of wildfire 
season is expected to become more and 
more the norm. 
We need to ensure that we have more 
resources at our disposal to confront 
them. The earlier we detect wildfire, 
the more quickly our firefighters can 
respond, and my amendment does just 
that. 
A lot of our effort in fighting 
wildfires has correctly been focused on 
suppression and prevention. But as our 
climate continues to change and cata-
strophic wildfires burn hotter and sea-
sons last longer, we need a whole-of- 
government 
approach 
to 
address 
wildfires. 
My amendment would further en-
hance the contributions of Federal 
science agencies as part of the National 
Wildland Fire Risk Reduction Pro-
gram. The amendment would also re-
quire an annual post fire-season weath-
er survey and assessment. These activi-
ties will help to identify data gaps, en-
hance efficiency and reliability of data, 
and evaluate the accuracy and effi-
ciency of our fire weather forecasting. 
My amendment will also formalize 
NOAA’s role in wildfire detection and 
response. In Chelan County, in my dis-
trict, there is a radar gap which makes 
it much more difficult to predict and 
track extreme weather. This gap also 
impacts our ability to track fires— 
something that is particularly critical 
to wildfire prone central Washington. 
The language in my amendment 
builds off legislation I recently intro-
duced with my colleague, Congressman 
BERA, H.R. 8449, the Fire Ready Nation 
Act, which is the House companion to 
Senator CANTWELL’s bipartisan bill. 
This bill would codify and support 
NOAA’s ability to help detect and re-
spond to wildfires. 
My amendment will strengthen con-
tributions of our weather science agen-
cies like NOAA to improve coordina-
tion and response efforts when it comes 
to fighting fires. This will be particu-
larly impactful in areas like my dis-
trict which lack robust radar coverage. 
As part of the needed whole-of-gov-
ernment response to wildfires, I am 
glad that the underlying bill includes 
language from two of my other bills. 
One, from my National Prescribed Fire 
Act, would direct the Secretaries of 
Agriculture and the Interior to estab-
lish at least one prescribed fire train-
ing center in a Western State. 
Prescribed burns during the offseason 
for fire allow for fuel reduction and 
prevent catastrophic forest fires. More 
training means more widespread use of 
prescribed fire. A recent report from 
the Washington Department of Natural 
Resources identified 3 million acres of 
forest land in need of restoration in my 
home State. Much of that area is rural 
central Washington where hot, dry 
weather and wind make wildfire espe-
cially probable and dangerous. 
The second bill would allow the For-
est Service to collect and keep the in-
terest earned on settlement funds, 
much like other Federal agencies can, 
in order to supplement restoration ef-
forts. This makes common sense and is 
a wise and fair use of the interest 
earned. 
Wildfires are becoming more extreme 
and catastrophic every year in western 
States. They are even beginning to af-
fect areas in my State that for a long 
time were thought to be too green and 
too wet for wildfires to happen, even 
the Olympic National Forest. Sadly, as 
our climate changes, this will become 
an increasing threat. 
I am thrilled to have an amendment 
to this legislation to allow for more

science and evidence-based decision-
making. We need every tool in our 
toolbox to prevent these fires. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
rise in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Arkansas is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to 
Schrier amendment No. 2 which would 
fund additional research for post-fire 
weather assessments. 
This amendment suffers from the 
same shortcomings as the underlying 
package because it is overly focused on 
wildfire response rather than even 
making an attempt at wildfire preven-
tion. 
We know what is causing cata-
strophic wildfires, and it is not a lack 
of 
government 
agencies 
studying 
wildfires, tracking weather, and pro-
ducing additional reports. Our forests 
are burning now, and we need to focus 
on real solutions; namely, accelerating, 
thinning, and prescribed burning. Add-
ing more duplicative bureaucracy and 
unnecessary research will do nothing 
to stop our forests from going up in 
flames year after year. 
Madam Chair, the forests really don’t 
care what we say in this body. They are 
out there doing what Teddy Roosevelt 
said they do. They are the lungs of the 
Earth. They breathe in the carbon di-
oxide and they breathe out oxygen. We 
produce a lot of carbon dioxide in this 
Chamber, but it is not doing anything 
to help our forests. 
b 1315 
Frankly, it is unserious that, out of 
the 
dozens 
of 
substantive 
wildfire 
amendments that were offered to the 
Rules Committee, this is the only one 
that was made in order. The Rules 
Committee even rejected bipartisan 
amendments such as the bipartisan 
Save Our Sequoias Act. We have lost 20 
percent of the world’s giant sequoias in 
the last 2 years, and perhaps the most 
famous 
giant 
sequoia 
grove, 
the 
Mariposa Grove in Yosemite National 
Park, was on fire earlier this month. 
What saved that grove? It wasn’t 
weather assessments. It was proactive 
treatments from land managers that 
we need to use as a model across all 76 
giant sequoia groves. 
Unfortunately, the underlying bill 
and amendment before us would do 
nothing to help protect our giant se-
quoias or move the needle on the wild-
fire crisis at all. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, may I 
inquire how much time remains. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
has 13⁄4 minute remaining. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I would 
like to clarify that we already have 
provisions in place to prevent wildfires, 
to remove underbrush, and to thin our 
forests and make they are more resil-
ient. The thing is that the earlier we 
can detect wildfires with appropriate 
weather systems, the earlier our fire-
fighters can jump on it and suppress 
those fires. 
You need both. You need the preven-
tion, and you need the ability to re-
spond quickly. So make no mistake. 
This is a critical amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the 
amendment and for the underlying bill. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, 
more and more of or forests are going 
up in flames. More forests are being 
categorized as subject to catastrophic 
wildfire. 
We are losing this fight. We need a 
new game plan. We need work on this 
in a bipartisan manner. There are a lot 
of areas that need to be addressed, but 
this bill, and this amendment doesn’t 
address those. 
I urge opposition to the amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I am 
thrilled to have worked with so many 
of my Republican colleagues on these 
bills to prevent wildfires. I encourage 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Washington will 
be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MS. VELA´ ZQUEZ 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in 
part C of House Report 117–432. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of division C the following 
new section: 
TITLE IV—COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS 
FOR 
DISASTER 
LOANS 
UNDER 
THE 
SMALL BUSINESS ACT 
SEC. ll. COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DIS-
ASTER LOANS UNDER THE SMALL 
BUSINESS ACT. 
(a) AMENDMENT
TO
THE RISE AFTER DIS-
ASTER ACT OF 2015.—Section 2102 of the RISE 
After Disaster Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–88) 
is amended— 
(1) by striking subsections (b) and (c); and 
(2) by striking ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—’’. 
(b) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall take effect and 
apply as though enacted as part of the RISE 
After Disaster Act of 2015 (Public Law 114– 
88). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1254, the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
There are at least 40 States and two 
territories with ongoing disaster dec-
larations for drought. The Small Busi-
ness Administration is currently serv-
ing the millions of small businesses 
and residents in those States to pro-
vide relief against economic loss. 
The SBA has also provided almost $1 
billion in wildfire disaster relief since 
2016. 
The amendment I am offering, along 
with my colleague, Congressman GAR-
RET GRAVES of Louisiana, would per-
manently set the unsecured credit 
threshold for SBA’s disaster loans at 
$25,000. Doing so gives the millions of 
borrowers affected by any natural dis-
aster, including wildfires and droughts, 
the peace of mind during a stressful 
and traumatic time. 
In 2015, Congress enacted the RISE 
Act, legislation I championed that 
temporarily 
raised 
the 
collateral 
threshold on SBA disaster loans to 
make it easier for victims to obtain 
capital to rebuild their homes and busi-
nesses. Unfortunately, that provision is 
scheduled to expire in November unless 
it is extended or made permanent. 
My amendment will make the provi-
sion permanent, allowing disaster vic-
tims to continue to receive a $25,000 
loan, rather than just $14,000, without 
requiring them to provide collateral 
within 5 days of closing. 
A recent report issued by the Govern-
ment Accountability Office found that 
disaster loans with collateral per-
formed comparably to those without 
collateral. Given this finding, it makes 
sense to help victims of disaster to re-
build quickly, particularly when they 
have lost everything to hurricane, 
flood, or fire. 
As we continue to experience strong-
er and more frequent disasters, it is 
imperative that Congress enact poli-
cies to help communities get back on 
their feet and maximize support when 
they need it most. 
Finally, this amendment is supported 
by the Small Business Administration. 
I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, 
for his support of this effort and his 
overall support of SBA’s disaster loan 
program. 
I thank Chairmen GRIJALVA
and 
MCGOVERN for working with me on this 
amendment. 
I am proud to leave the Small Busi-
nesses Committee’s bipartisan work to 
make disaster loans more affordable 
and accessible for disaster victims, 
while also addressing fraud in the 
SBA’s pandemic relief programs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7491 
July 29, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
claim 
time 
in 
opposition 
to 
this 
amendment, even though I might not 
necessarily oppose it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Arkansas is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Chair, I support this amend-
ment and appreciate the solution it 
presents for a pressing problem. Cur-
rently, the Small Business Administra-
tion only requires collateral for dis-
aster loans if the loan amount is above 
$25,000. This authority is set to sunset 
in 
November, 
and 
the 
minimum 
amount will revert to $14,000. This 
amendment would permanently lock in 
the amount at $25,000. 
I thank the ranking member of the 
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis, GARRET GRAVES, for his leadership 
on disaster issues. His home State of 
Louisiana has suffered through many 
disasters, and he has been an unwaver-
ing champion for his constituents. 
And it is a good thing he is leading 
on this issue. Affordable disaster loans 
could be in high demand because the 
underlying bill does nothing to protect 
the landscape, people, or property from 
devastating wildfires. I would like to 
emphasize, the underlying bill would 
only respond to wildfires, not work to 
prevent them. 
Throughout this debate, my col-
leagues have tried to claim that this is 
not the case and that their bill will ac-
tually support increased forest man-
agement practices like thinning and 
prescribed burning. 
But look no further than their own 
one-pager, which says derisively: ‘‘We 
can’t simply cut our way out of wild-
fire risk.’’ This should tell you every-
thing you need to know about how they 
feel about scientific forest manage-
ment. 
The truth is that thinning is not only 
an essential tool to reduce wildfire 
risk, but there is a scientific consensus 
that we must increase thinning in our 
forests to turn the tide of this crisis. 
The fact that this bill mentions 
thinning zero times is no mistake. It is 
because Democrats refuse to agree with 
the scientific consensus that both 
thinning and prescribed burning are es-
sential tools to reduce wildfire risk. 
Affordable disaster loans provided by 
this amendment will also be necessary 
because of the wildfires that will occur 
as a result of throwing out the Forest 
Service’s current 10-year strategy. 
My colleagues have claimed that 
their bill would simply codify this cur-
rent 10-year strategy. They have also 
said that the infrastructure bill made 
historic investments in that strategy 
and have funded its initial projects. 
This simply makes no sense. My col-
leagues think the infrastructure bill is 
so nice that they want to pass it twice, 
but that is not how any of this works. 
If we funded a project in the infrastruc-
ture bill, we don’t need to authorize 
funding for it here because that money 
has already gone out the door. 
And if the administration released a 
strategy 6 months ago and started im-
plementing it, they don’t need this bill 
to codify it. 
Truth be told, the plain reading of 
the text shows that the current wild-
fire strategy is getting thrown out the 
window, and nothing in this text codi-
fies it or even mentions the projects 
currently happening. 
Unfortunately, if this bill passes, a 
lot of small business owners will be 
able to make good use of affordable dis-
aster loans provided by this amend-
ment as they recover their businesses 
from the impacts of catastrophic wild-
fire. The least we can do is help them 
with disaster loans after these fires in-
evitably occur. 
Madam Chair, I support this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 1302, providing for 
consideration of H.R. 1808, the Assault 
Weapons Ban of 2022, under a closed 
rule. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment from Chairman NADLER. It 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided by the chair and ranking member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
b 1400 
Madam Speaker, we have a gun vio-
lence crisis in this country, 23 years 
after Columbine High School, 10 years 
after Sandy Hook Elementary School, 4 
years after Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School, and 2 months after Uvalde 
and Buffalo. The American people are 
tired of living in fear. They are tired of 
thoughts and prayers. They are tired of 
press releases offering sympathy but no 
solutions. 
Last month, the decades-long logjam 
on passing commonsense gun safety 
bills 
was 
broken. 
President 
Biden 
signed into law the bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act to help keep guns out 
of the hands of criminals. 
Why? 
Because the American people want to 
see us act. For decades, that hasn’t 
happened. The gun lobby has had an 
iron grip on this place. But now, fi-
nally, that is changing. It is changing 
because the American people are de-
manding change, and it is time for all 
of us to listen. 
We can and must do more, which is 
why, today, we are considering H.R. 
1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. 
Now, I want to be crystal clear for 
everyone who is watching. 
This bill is not taking away any-
body’s guns. 
This bill is not about taking away 
anybody’s constitutional rights. The 
Second Amendment gives Americans 
the right to own guns, but no right is 
unconditional or unlimited. 
You have the right to free speech, 
but you don’t have the right to shout 
‘‘fire’’ in a crowded movie theater. You 
have the right to keep and bear arms, 
but you don’t have the right to own 
weapons being used to mow people 
down indiscriminately. 
Rights come with responsibilities, 
and we have a responsibility to try and 
stop mass shootings. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
duty to weigh the rights of gun owners 
with the very first right mentioned in 
the Declaration of Independence: the 
right to live; the right to not get shot 
at school or at a place of worship or at 
a concert. 
It takes zero courage to hide behind 
the Second Amendment and not debate 
the merits here. 
You know what takes courage? 
Standing up to the gun lobby, put-
ting people over politics. That takes 
courage, and that is what we are doing 
here today. 
Rounds that come out of assault 
weapons are traveling up to four times 
faster than out of a handgun. They are 
traveling at incredible speed and inflict 
immense damage on people’s bodies. 
When combined with high-capacity 
magazines, they are designed to kill as 
many people as possible, as quickly as 
possible. 
Assault weapons do not belong on our 
streets, plain and simple. 
An assault weapon was used in Las 
Vegas to kill 60 people. 
An assault weapon was used at the 
Pulse Nightclub to kill 49 people. 
An assault weapon was used at Sandy 
Hook to kill 26 people, including 20 
children. 
Assault weapons slaughter people. 
They decimate bodies. Physicians say 
that an AR–15 can actually ‘‘liquefy 
your organs’’ because the projectile is 
traveling so fast. This does not happen 
with a typical handgun. This is some-
thing unique to assault weapons. 
Sixty-seven percent of Americans, in-
cluding half of all Republicans, support 
a ban on assault weapons. 
This is not a radical idea. We are not 
in uncharted territory. The Govern-
ment already bans automatic weapons. 
Why? 
Because they have no place in our 
communities. 
You don’t need an automatic weapon 
to defend yourself. What we are pro-
posing today is simply addressing an-
other class of weapons that have no 
place in our communities: assault 
weapons. 
The 1994 assault weapons ban was as-
sociated with a 25 percent drop in gun 
massacres and a 40 percent drop in fa-
talities. This should not be a difficult 
vote. Let’s come together and advance 
this 
commonsense 
legislation 
that 
could save thousands of lives. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished 
chairman for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today makes in order H.R. 1808, an un-
constitutional bill to ban hundreds of 
the most popular firearms in the 
United States, including the sporting 
rifle, the AR–15. 
Law-abiding Americans in places like 
southwestern Pennsylvania and across 
the country use firearms every single 
day for things like sport shooting, 
hunting, and self-defense. So despite 
what the House Democrats claim, this 
bill would do little to prevent the mass 
shootings or the crime they are saying 
that it would, and this bill would not 
prevent criminals from obtaining fire-
arms. 
I know the chairman just referenced 
a 1994 study. That was a congression-
ally mandated study to look at the 1994 
assault weapons ban. That study found 
that ban was ineffective in reducing 
violent crime. ‘‘The banned guns were 
never used in more than a modest frac-
tion of all gun murders.’’ 
A follow-up study to that 1994 ban 
came out in 2004, and that study found 
that ‘‘the ban’s effects on gun violence 
are likely to be small at best and per-
haps too small for reliable measure-
ment.’’ 
Even UCLA law professor Adam 
Winkler, the resident anti-gun, so- 
called subject matter expert, a left- 
leaning professor, stated: ‘‘There’s no 
way to make assault rifle bans effec-
tive.’’ 
To that point, we saw that during the 
tragic shootings in San Bernardino, 
Newtown, and Buffalo, those all oc-
curred in States that already had as-
sault weapons bans on the books. 
So the question is this: Why are my 
far-left Democratic colleagues bringing 
this bill to the floor today? 
Well, in the words of Committee on 
the Judiciary Chairman JERRY NAD-
LER, ‘‘ . . . banning these ‘common use’ 
firearms is the ‘point of the bill.’ ’’ 
In other words, let’s call this what it 
is. It is a gun grab, pure and simple. 
This bill is not about public safety. 
Rather, this is the most severe restric-
tion on the Second Amendment since 
the passage of the assault weapons ban 
of 1994. It would turn an American 
lending a firearm to a friend to go 
hunting into a criminal. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this rule, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman talks about statistics. 
Let’s talk about statistics. 
Thirty percent of shootings in recent 
history have involved guns that were 
banned under the now-expired 1994 as-
sault weapons ban. 
Thirteen killed and 23 injured at Col-
umbine High School in Littleton, Colo-
rado. The attackers used an assault 
weapon. 
Twenty-seven killed and one injured 
at an elementary school in Newtown, 
Connecticut. That was in December of 
2012. The attacker used an assault 
weapon. 
Forty-nine killed and 53 injured at 
the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Flor-
ida, June 2016. The attacker used an as-
sault weapon. 
Fifty-eight killed and 887 injured at a 
country music festival in Las Vegas in 
October of 2017. The attacker used an

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Rules. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rep-
resent a southern State. Many of my 
constituents are responsible, law-abid-
ing gun owners, and I support their 
ability 
to 
exercise 
their 
Second 
Amendment rights. 
Contrary to what opponents of this 
legislation continue to claim, this bill 
will allow current, law-abiding gun 
owners to keep all of their guns. It sim-
ply prevents future sales of assault ri-
fles. 
Let’s be clear: Assault weapons are 
designed to kill as many people as pos-
sible as quickly as possible. They are 
not designed for recreation. They are 
designed for combat. 
It is incredibly irresponsible to allow 
people without specialized training to 
possess these weapons. 
Madam Speaker, when assault weap-
ons are used in mass shootings, on av-
erage, six times as many people are 
shot as in other mass shootings. 
In 2022, there have already been 24 
school shootings. The deadliest, in 
Uvalde, Texas, involved an assault 
weapon. 
But if my friends across the aisle are 
not convinced of the need to protect 
our children, perhaps they will be con-
vinced of the need to protect the po-
lice. According to Violence Policy Cen-
ter, one quarter of law enforcement of-
ficers killed in the line of duty in 2016 
were killed by an assault weapon. 
After the assault weapons ban ex-
pired, the proportion of large-capacity- 
magazine-equipped guns used in mur-
ders of police increased by 30 percent. 
These weapons belong with our mili-
tary, not on our streets or in our 
schools. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the rule and the bill. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
This false equivalence between an 
AR–15 and a so-called weapon of war 
just shows the ignorance of my friends 
on the other side of the aisle. 
An AR–15 is not an M16. An M16 has 
numerous 
functions: 
safety, 
three- 
round 
bursts, 
semi-automatic, 
and 
fully automatic. An AR–15 has no such 
setting as a three-round burst and the 
fully automatic. So this false compari-
son between a so-called weapon of war 
and what we would describe as sporting 
rifle, again, shows the lack of under-
standing about these platforms. 
Additionally, the AR–15 is by far the 
most popular sporting rifle in the 
United States. There are over 20 mil-
lion that are in the possession of Amer-
icans right now. 
But while we are talking about sta-
tistics, a 2020 FBI study shows that 
there are more murders committed 
with knives, clubs, and fists than with 
firearms. 
Also, when you are looking at fire-
arm deaths, just in the year 2020, both 
the CDC and the FBI reported that 
over 
half 
of 
these 
firearm-related 
deaths were suicides. So let’s just be 
clear when we are talking about statis-
tics. 
If you are breaking down those stud-
ies, you can look at 2020, where 59 per-
cent of murders were committed by 
handguns. Only 3 percent were com-
mitted with what is being described as 
assault rifles, what I would describe as 
sporting rifles. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), my good friend from the 
Committee on Rules, who is here to 
talk more about this issue. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the Com-
mittee on Rules for providing the time 
to speak. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues are 
proving, yet again, that they want to 
strip law-abiding citizens of their Sec-
ond Amendment rights. The latest so- 
called assault weapons ban is unconsti-
tutional and will impact other aspects 
of American life. 
This bill would end the sale of some 
of the most popular rifles sold in Amer-
ica today, impacting the sporting in-
dustry and all of those who rely on it 
for their livelihoods. 
This bill will have an impact in ways 
even the supporters of the bill do not 
understand. For example, under this 
law, stabilizing braces for pistols would 
be outlawed. 
Despite what some of my colleagues 
have said, stabilizing braces are not 
bump stocks and will not turn a pistol 
into an assault rifle. Stabilizing braces 
are used by hunters with disabilities, 
including many of our disabled vet-
erans, to help them safely hunt with 
pistols. 
Not only is this bill an assault on our 
constitutional rights, but the loss of 
the revenue from the sales of these 
firearms will also have a devastating 
impact on the Federal Aid to Wildlife 
Restoration Fund, which helps States 
pay for environmental conservation ef-
forts. The bill provides no alternative

for how to make up for the severe de-
crease in conservation funding. 
Democrats are no longer disguising 
their radical agenda to ban guns and do 
away with the Constitution’s Second 
Amendment. My colleagues from the 
other side have said that they will do 
everything they can to ban guns in this 
country, even to the point of packing 
the Supreme Court to make it happen. 
Anyone who thinks this bill is not a 
step in that direction is kidding them-
selves. This is yet another attempt 
from the left to strip law-abiding citi-
zens 
of 
their 
Second 
Amendment 
rights, and I oppose this bill and the 
rule. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just respond to the gentle-
woman by saying that the manager’s 
amendment adds language to make 
clear that devices used to make hunt-
ing accessible to everyone, especially 
our disabled veterans, are not affected 
by this legislation. 
This provision also makes sure the 
gun industry cannot exploit legitimate 
accessibility devices to make firearms 
especially deadly for mass shooters as 
has occurred in the past when bump 
stocks were claimed to be an accessi-
bility accessory but used to inflict hor-
rible mass violence in the 2017 Las 
Vegas shooting that killed 60 and in-
jured more than 400 people. 
b 1415 
And I say to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, I didn’t use the words 
‘‘weapon of war’’ in my opening state-
ment, and I certainly know the dif-
ference between an automatic and a 
semiautomatic weapon, but if that is 
the argument you want to have, bring 
that to the parents whose children 
were lost in Uvalde, you know, who 
were mowed down by an AR–15. As I 
pointed out in my opening statement, 
these weapons actually decimate bod-
ies. Physicians say that an AR–15 can 
actually liquify your organs because 
the projectile is traveling so fast. 
As the gentleman may recall, DNA 
samples had to be gathered from those 
children who were murdered because 
their bodies were unrecognizable. So, I 
mean, come on. 
This is about saving lives. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
weapons of war are designed for war. 
They are designed to kill as many peo-
ple as possible as quickly as possible. 
Our country is exceptional in making 
these weapons of war, these assault 
weapons, available in the civilian sec-
tor, and we have quickly—because 
those weapons are easier to qualify for 
than getting a driver’s license; they are 
easier for a teenager to get than to buy 
a beer, because we have done that, we 
have turned our churches, our schools, 
our shopping centers, our entertain-
ment venues, almost any place, into a 
battleground with one massacre after 
another. 
There is no Second Amendment right 
to own a machine gun, which has been 
banned in this country since, I believe, 
the thirties. But if you talk about 
rights, how about the rights of those 
little children in Uvalde to live, the 
rights of those families to be whole? 
They have rights, also. And that is 
what we are protecting today. 
I think that we just cannot continue 
to live like we have been living in the 
shadow of fear, a terrible kind of Amer-
ican exceptionalism where we are hor-
ribly exceptional to the amount of dead 
children gunned down in their best ten-
nis shoes after end of the school year 
celebrations, of young parents having 
to bury their still younger little chil-
dren; where we are the exception in 
how many congregants die where they 
are massacred in their churches or in 
their temples; where we are the excep-
tion, the outlier in how many grue-
some bullet-ridden bodies our doctors 
see month after month. 
And God help us because Texas has 
been among the worst. From El Paso to 
Uvalde to across the center of the 
State to the Houston area, murderers, 
massacres with assault weapons, where 
one family or another grieves. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Texas children right now have no re-
ality as they will soon be returning to 
school than to duck and cover and 
learn new exercises. We can do some-
thing about that and banning assault 
weapons is the most critical issue in 
doing that, not the kind of weak, mod-
est measure that will never change 
things in Texas that we passed earlier 
in the year since it is dependent on the 
Texas legislature, but a direct effort to 
limit the access to assault weapons 
that are weapons of war that kill and 
kill and kill that make us exceptional 
in quite the wrong way. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I just want it noted that the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts said that 
no one on his side is describing these 
weapons as ‘‘weapons of war,’’ and then 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT), the first thing he said was that 
AR–15s are ‘‘weapons are war.’’ 
So, we need to understand that when 
the left and when radical Democrats 
are describing AR–15s as ‘‘weapons of 
war,’’ and as the gentleman from Texas 
just said, ‘‘machine guns,’’ they are 
doing two things simultaneously. Num-
ber one, they are showing their abso-
lute ignorance for how these platforms 
operate; and two, they are deliberately 
trying to mislead the American people 
on what these platforms do. 
No one on my side of the aisle is try-
ing to say that machine guns should be 
legal. An AR–15 is a sporting rifle; it is 
a semiautomatic. It is not the kind of 
platform that is used by the military. 
It is not an M16, it is not an M4; but, 
again, the other side tries to use this 
to muddy the waters and confuse the 
American people and to put all fire-
arms in the same category. 
Let’s talk about some more statis-
tics. In 2021, a Georgetown study found 
that 1.67 million instances were found 
where firearms were used in self-de-
fense. In 2019 alone, there were 386 self- 
defense killings that were determined 
to be justified. So, these are just some 
of the ways in which someone can le-
gally use a sporting rifle. 
Let’s talk about the chaos at the 
southern border. Since Joe Biden took 
office, over 3.1 million illegal immi-
grants have been apprehended at the 
southern border, and that includes 56 
illegal immigrants who were on the 
terror watch list. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats have this open-door policy that 
has created a humanitarian crisis and a 
security crisis, as well, and they want 
to make things worse by lifting title 
42. 
Republicans know border security is 
national security. That is why if we de-
feat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider H.R. 471, the 
PAUSE Act of 2021, to enforce title 42. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
any extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my good 
friend, to explain the amendment. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
leadership on this matter. Yes, we 
shouldn’t be talking about disarming 
the American people when it is my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that are leaving the American people 
exposed to dangerous cartels and dan-
gerous narcotics flying through your 
communities and dangerous criminal 
gang members and criminals that are 
coming in and harming the American 
people, including people that are affili-
ated with terrorist countries and orga-
nizations. My colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle don’t seem to care a 
whit about that. 
Yesterday, Mayor Bowser was all 
upset because 4,000 people have been 
bused to D.C. from Texas since April. 
4,000 people. Do you know how many 
people were apprehended in Texas yes-
terday? About 4,000 people. 
Welcome to the party. Because that 
is the reality of what we are dealing 
with at our southern border. Virtually 
all of the people being apprehend are 
being released into the United States 
under notice to appear or parole. There 
is only one barrier to all being re-
leased, and that is the use of title 42 
during a pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7495 
July 29, 2022 
Now, I notice a number of the staff, a 
number of the folks on the other side of 
the aisle, people that are still masked. 
We still are under emergency declara-
tions, and yet, we are going to allow 
people to flow into this country, and 
we are going to remove the one last 
vestige of security that this adminis-
tration remotely will actually look at 
and use: title 42 at our border. 
They are building facilities to proc-
ess more people to release them into 
the United States. 
Mayor Bowser wants to complain and 
then call out the National Guard be-
cause 4,000 people were shipped from 
Texas to D.C.; the 4,000 that Texas gets 
on a daily basis. Again, welcome to the 
dang party. 
You know what? Do you know what 
you are not talking about, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle? 
The 73 human beings caught in a stash 
house in Washington, D.C., this week. 
Seventy-three human beings in a stash 
house in our Nation’s Capital. But my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, my colleagues particularly on 
the Judiciary Committee, brushed that 
aside, patting themselves on the back 
in the false name of compassion for 
how much they love Brown people for 
having open borders. Well, the Brown 
people in south Texas are sick and 
tired of it. The Brown people of south 
Texas that I know, the candidates on 
my side of the aisle, are standing up for 
a secure border, and that begins with 
enforcing our laws under title 42 during 
a pandemic to ensure that we turn peo-
ple away. 
My friend, YVETTE HERRELL, intro-
duced a bill that would solve the prob-
lem, and that is what we would proceed 
to. We have a discharge petition that 
would unleash that bill. I welcome any 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle to join that discharge peti-
tion, perhaps, particularly if you are in 
a tough race. You might want to go 
home and say that you actually care 
about a secure border. 
But what I will tell you is, is that we 
should be moving to secure the border 
of the United States, rather than this 
fool’s errand of the unconstitutional 
taking of Americans’ Second Amend-
ment rights. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say something to my 
friend from Pennsylvania. You know, 
maybe it is true that the military 
doesn’t use AR–15s, but I will say to 
the gentleman that mass shooters do. 
We saw what an AR–15 can do in 
Uvalde. We saw what it can do in Buf-
falo. 
I just remind people when you have 
these kind of debates that people are 
watching. You know, the parents who 
lost their children in Uvalde, they are 
watching. People who have lost ones to 
mass shootings all around this country 
are watching. You know, to try to 
parse words over, well, you know, it is 
not a military-style weapon or this or 
that or whatever when we know what 
these weapons can do, that little chil-
dren had to be identified with DNA 
samples because their bodies were 
blown apart. 
You know, you want to talk about 
extreme positions? We just had a Rules 
Committee meeting, and Mr. MASSIE 
testified before the Rules Committee. 
You may recall the back and forth be-
tween him and Mr. RASKIN when Mr. 
RASKIN essentially asked him whether 
or not machine guns should be legal, 
and Mr. MASSIE responded by saying, 
well, I think States should make that 
determination. 
So that means that if a State wanted 
to make machine guns legal, it is 
somehow okay? So you want to talk 
about extremism? We have seen what 
extremism is all about from many of 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle, and we have seen the power of 
the gun lobby, the blood money that 
has poured into campaigns that has re-
sulted in people coming to the floor 
and making these ridiculous arguments 
for us to do nothing. So this is a mo-
ment when people have to stand up and 
be counted. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. We 
can see the lengths the Democrats have 
gone to to simply try to save lives. 
With John Lewis we sat on the floor of 
the House, not regarding what would 
happen to us personally after Parkland 
and literally said you have got to do 
something. As John Lewis said: ‘‘Never 
give up, never give in, never give out,’’ 
the moral authority of this Congress. 
We failed because my friends on the 
other side of the aisle just could not 
see the carnage and bloodshed that 
happened to Parkland or Sandy Hook 
and elsewhere. Now we have in the 
backdrop El Paso. We have Uvalde. And 
I repeat myself, going there days after 
that tragedy and literally hugging cry-
ing 9-year-olds who should be on the 
playground who are crying because of 
their loss and deceased friends. The 
story that is so powerful, two of them, 
one that bled to death, and one that 
smeared themselves with blood to live. 
Do we now stand in the way of stop-
ping carnage and bloodshed? And my 
good friend that I have done a lot of 
things with, M4s, M16s are weapons are 
war; if I have the correct numbers, and 
I believe I do. 
You can pontificate about that, but, 
frankly, the language is ‘‘assault-style 
weapons.’’ That is what it is. And as-
sault-style weapons still do not belong 
in civilians’ hands because the muni-
tions that are used in war, when sol-
diers can’t even bring their weapons of 
war home when they are off duty or 
coming home to see family members or 
traveling as a civilian, it is because 
they are killers. And that is what 
killed those children in Parkland, 
Highland. That is what killed them in 
Uvalde, in Buffalo. That is what killed 
these people in El Paso, and in the 
hands in some instances of white su-
premacists. 
Let me be perfectly clear, as I thank 
Mr. CICILLINE for this legislation, he 
prohibits that possession. Many of 
them are grandfathered in. I wish 
somebody would read the bill. These 
are weapons already grandfathered in. 
Don’t frighten the American people. 
What is most frightening are the par-
ents who are outside these doors. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 
minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
what is really frightening is that par-
ents who are outside these doors are 
asking the question: What are we 
doing? 
b 1430 
I would say the families in Buffalo, 
where the theme was replacement the-
ory, or these little babies, where is 
your heart in a reasonable bill that 
prohibits the sale, manufacture, trans-
fer, or possession of semiautomatic as-
sault weapons and large-capacity am-
munition feeding devices subject to 
grandfathering provisions but, in actu-
ality, allows the possession of any 
semiautomatic assault weapon law-
fully possessed on the date of enact-
ment? 
How much fairer can we get? I only 
ask my colleagues to stop pontificating 
to us like we know less than you when 
it comes, as a civilian, that there are 
weapons of war that our military has, 
that there are assault-style weapons 
that are in the hands of citizens on the 
streets of this country, and that they 
adapt the same munitions. The indi-
vidual in Uvalde had 350 pounds. 
Madam Speaker, let us vote for the 
rule and the underlying bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to please direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have a lot of re-
spect for my colleague from Texas, but 
when the question is asked why serv-
icemembers can’t bring their M16s and 
their M4s home, it is because those are 
fully automatic weapons. They are not 
AR–15s. 
The gentlewoman actually answers 
her own question. The M16 and the M4 
platform are automatic. The AR–15 is 
not automatic. They are two different 
platforms. 
The gentlewoman and the gentleman 
from Texas said words to the effect of, 
‘‘What are we doing? Why are Repub-
licans not doing enough?’’ or words to 
that effect. 
Well, let me remind my colleagues 
across the aisle that it was Repub-
licans, not Democrats, it was Repub-
licans in 2017 that had the Fix NICS 
Act. It is Republicans that are trying 
to get legislation passed to keep guns

out of the hands of criminals, not out 
of the hands of law-abiding citizens. It 
was the last administration under 
President Trump that banned bump 
stocks when the Obama administration 
let that ban expire. 
Those are just a few things that Re-
publicans are doing in this arena. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ- 
BALART), my good friend. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
title 42 is a critical tool to manage the 
crisis at the southern border. It is hard 
to believe that the Biden administra-
tion claims that the termination of 
title 42 would actually decrease the 
number of encounters at the border. 
This is not only grotesquely disingen-
uous; it is actually laughable. 
Does the administration not remem-
ber the caravans headed to the south-
ern border when the administration 
just announced the end of title 42? 
Do you know the cartels actually 
used the end of title 42 to promote, to 
advertise, their human smuggling busi-
ness? 
Has the administration even spoken 
to our brave heroes, the Border Patrol 
agents, who consistently say that with-
out title 42 authority, they would lose 
any semblance of operational control 
on the border? 
Let’s be clear. The expected influx of 
border crossings if title 42 ended is not 
just a humanitarian crisis, which it is. 
It is a national security crisis, as well. 
The cartels will once again use the in-
creased flow as a distraction to con-
tinue to bring in record amounts of 
narcotics such as fentanyl. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question so that we can bring up H.R. 
471, the PAUSE Act, to help give our 
border agents the tools that they need 
in order to achieve operational control 
of the border. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE), my 
good friend. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I am amazed at how my radical 
friends on the left now are so con-
cerned with the lives of children when 
they literally stand and cheer and cele-
brate the killing of 3,000 through abor-
tion every single day. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to this rule that allows the consider-
ation of the assault weapons ban. 
What we have going on right now is a 
complete disregard for regular order 
that started yesterday and is con-
tinuing here today. The House floor is 
being run like a circus, quite frankly, 
and the American people deserve better 
than this. 
They continue, the Democrats do, to 
ram legislation through without proper 
notice and without even markup in 
committees. The floor should be run 
with at least a basic sense of decorum, 
and that is totally out of control right 
now. There is a complete lack of re-
spect for the rules and the norms of 
this historic institution and how it 
should be run. 
As for the legislation being consid-
ered, it is just another attempt by the 
radical left to once again take away 
the Second Amendment rights of the 
American people. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
time 
and 
time 
again, the left here has tried to dis-
regard and trample the constitutional 
rights of the American people. 
This bill is full of, among other 
things, questionable definitions that 
show that the left doesn’t even know 
what they are talking about when it 
comes to the issue of assault weapons. 
Madam Speaker, I implore my col-
leagues to vote against this rule and 
the previous question, as well. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
very briefly. Maybe the gentleman 
hasn’t been paying attention to what 
has been going on around here, but this 
bill actually had a hearing and a mark-
up, 14 hours in the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
Madam Speaker, the text has been 
available 72 hours in advance. The 
manager’s amendment was made avail-
able on Tuesday night. I don’t know 
what the heck he is talking about. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE), 
my good friend. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, we are here debating about an 
assault weapons ban so that the chair-
man of the Committee on the Judiciary 
can campaign when he goes back home, 
which is really odd because in that dis-
trict, in that area of New York, they 
don’t seem to be suffering from as 
much crime as the rest of New York 
where people really do need guns to de-
fend themselves or maybe the rest of 
America or like Atlanta in my home 
State of Georgia. 
I will tell you something right now. I 
thank God for AR–15s because there 
have been a lot of people that have 
saved their own lives and defended oth-
ers. I will remind you of a few. 
How about an 8-month pregnant 
woman who saved her husband’s and 
daughter’s lives from home invaders 
who were trying to kill them? Thank 
God she had an AR–15. 
Let me remind you of a man that had 
an AR–15 that was able to defend a 
church from a mass shooter who killed 
26 people in the First Baptist Church in 
Sutherland, Texas. Thank God for his 
AR–15. 
Let me explain something to my 
Democrat colleagues. You can pass as 
many gun control laws as you like, but 
no one will stop a murderer. No one is 
going to hand over a gun who has mur-
der in their heart. 
Do you think that your gun control 
laws are going to cause criminals to 
come running to hand over the AR–15s 
that they possess? No, I don’t think so. 
If you are concerned about protecting 
Americans and saving lives, stop vot-
ing to kill babies up until the day of 
birth. Care about those children and 
their body parts, and then do some-
thing about all the crime all over 
America that is affecting Americans 
every single day. 
How about our border? How about 
our border being overrun with drugs 
and fentanyl and human trafficking? 
Do you care about those people, those 
migrants who are dying on the way be-
cause of your policies of open borders? 
Oh, no, it is not the gun that is the 
problem. It is the policies. It is the 
policies that you are pushing right now 
that are hurting Americans and caus-
ing our children to not be safe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Whether it 
is Pennsylvania or Massachusetts, they 
are still two great Commonwealths, 
right? 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers at this time, and I yield my-
self the balance of my time for closing. 
Madam Speaker, I am incredibly dis-
appointed but, unfortunately, not at 
all surprised that, once again, we are 
considering legislation that will do 
nothing more than penalize law-abid-
ing citizens while doing absolutely 
nothing about the root cause of gun vi-
olence. 
We know from history, and we know 
from numerous studies that I have 
talked about today, that assault weap-
ons bans do not work. 
So, why is this bill coming before us 
today? It is just the latest in the House 
Democrats’ never-ending attack on 
America’s Second Amendment rights. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question and vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
have great respect for my friend from 
Pennsylvania and all of my colleagues 
on the Committee on Rules, and I know 
they feel strongly about this issue. I 
believe that many of the concerns that 
they have raised are unwarranted, and 
this bill deals with many of them. 
As has been said repeatedly, this is 
not about taking away anybody’s guns. 
It is dealing with the future. It is deal-
ing with ways that we can better pro-
tect the people of this country. 
So, it is frustrating when we hear ar-
guments about, ‘‘Oh, you said military- 
style. This, technically, isn’t a mili-
tary weapon,’’ or we have all these 
numbers that have been kind of manip-
ulated and presented as reasons for us 
to do nothing. I find that really dis-
concerting. Maybe it is because so 
many people are dying. Maybe it is be-
cause so many people are being mur-
dered by these weapons. 
The sheer number is incomprehen-
sible. Maybe some of my colleagues

have lost the human ability to feel 
what that really means. I mean, I have 
talked to parents, and I have talked to 
brothers and sisters, to grandparents, 
who have lost loved ones in these mas-
sacres, who have lost loved ones to as-
sault weapons. I mean, it is painful. 
We can do something to make it pos-
sible that fewer people are victims of 
mass shootings, that fewer children 
die, that fewer churchgoers die, fewer 
people shopping in the grocery store or 
going to a concert or just minding 
their own business. 
I mean, the gun violence in this 
country has reached epidemic propor-
tions. It is unbelievable. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of being scared. I mean, when my 
own kids go to the movies, I worry 
about them. I am worried that there 
might be somebody with an AR–15 that 
will be in that movie theater, or if they 
go to a concert. I think my anxiety is 
similar to the anxiety of most parents 
when their kids go out. This doesn’t 
have to be. 
All I am pleading with my colleagues 
to do is to think long and hard on how 
they vote on this. 
Madam Speaker, we should all be 
sick to our stomachs about what is 
happening. The idea that somehow we 
can’t do anything about it I don’t 
think anybody buys. 
I get it. The gun lobby plays a big 
role with many of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle. Follow the 
money; you will see what I am talking 
about. I don’t want you to do anything, 
but I am pleading with my colleagues, 
especially on the Republican side of 
the aisle. I mean, this is the right 
thing to do. 
The previous assault weapons ban 
had an impact. Unfortunately, it was 
left to expire. I mean, we need to pass 
this. This is the right thing to do. Talk 
to the families. Talk to those who lost 
loved ones in one of these massacres. 
As I said, to defend AR–15s that can 
destroy the bodies of people—I remind 
you that the children in Uvalde, many 
of them had to be identified by DNA. 
I mean, at some point, we have to say 
enough is enough. At some point, we 
have to turn our words into action. 
Madam Speaker, I am hoping and 
praying that this is the day. I urge all 
of my colleagues to vote for the rule 
and vote for the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1302 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the

‘‘(J) Compensation for surrendered semiauto-

fined in section 921 of title 18, United States

SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. 
If any provision of this Act, an amendment 
made by this Act, or the application of such pro-
vision or amendment to any person or cir-
cumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the re-
mainder of this Act, the amendments made by 
this Act, and the application of such provision 
or amendment to any person or circumstance 
shall not be affected thereby. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1808. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we take another 
step to advance historic gun violence 
prevention legislation. H.R. 1808, the 
Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2022, re-
stores and updates the prior assault 
weapons ban that kept weapons of war 
out of our communities for a decade be-
fore Republicans opposed its renewal. 
As we have learned all too well in re-
cent years, assault weapons, especially 
when 
combined 
with 
high-capacity 
magazines, are the weapon of choice for 
mass shootings. These military-style 
weapons are designed to kill the most 
people in the shortest amount of time. 
Quite simply, there is no place for 
them in our streets. 
In 1994, we banned these killing ma-
chines, and countless lives were saved. 
But that ban was allowed to lapse 10 
years later. Since then, we have seen 
the predictable results: Mass shootings 
have increased exponentially in our 
public spaces. Schools, movie theaters, 
supermarkets, houses of worship, pa-
rades, you name it, have all become 
vulnerable to attack. 
Uvalde, Parkland, Tree of Life Syna-
gogue. How many more mass shootings 
must we endure? When will we learn? 
Well, I hope we are starting to learn 
today. I hope we are starting to learn 
today indeed. 
The Assault Weapons Ban Act would 
prohibit the sale, manufacture, trans-
fer, or possession of semiautomatic as-
sault weapons and large-capacity am-
munition feeding devices. At the same 
time, it grandfathers existing semi-
automatic assault weapons and con-
tains numerous protections for law en-
forcement and responsible gun owners, 
including 
hunters, 
gun 
collectors, 
farmers, sports shooters, and those who 
use firearms for self-defense. 
It is important to consider today’s 
debate in the context of our other ef-
forts to address the violence plaguing 
our communities. 
Time and again, Democrats have ad-
vanced responsible gun safety legisla-
tion, only to face Republican opposi-
tion. 
We have advanced legislation to con-
duct background checks for all gun 
sales, to close the Charleston loophole, 
to close the boyfriend loophole, and to 
keep guns away from those who are a 
danger to themselves or others. 
We advanced my bill, the Protecting 
our Kids Act, and we sent the President 
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, 
which was signed into law and will save 
lives. These proposals were opposed by 
all but a few of our Republican col-
leagues. 
Today, they have another chance to 
take the action needed to make our 
communities safer. Will they stand 
with us? Will they show that they have 
learned? Or will they stand with an in-
dustry that right now is promoting a 
weapon to civilians that is powerful 
enough to shoot through bulletproof 
vests? 
Will 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
choose to defend the weapons of choice 
for mass murderers and those who seek 
to target law enforcement? Or will 
they choose to defend Americans who 
simply want to go to school, to go 
shopping, to march in a parade, or to 
go to a movie theater without the fear 
of having a target on their back? It is 
an easy choice for me. 
I thank Congressman CICILLINE for 
his leadership on this important legis-
lation, I urge all of my colleagues to 
join me in supporting it, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, for years, the Demo-
crats told us: We are not coming for 
your guns. 
Oh, yes, they are. 
Let’s be clear. The Second Amend-
ment is as clear as possible. That is 
their beef. The Second Amendment 
says: The right to keep and bear arms 
shall not be infringed. But they don’t 
care. 
In fact, the sponsor of this legislation 
said so in committee. He said: ‘‘Spare 
me 
the 
BS 
about 
constitutional 
rights.’’ They don’t care about that 
fundamental liberty law-abiding citi-
zens in this country enjoy, and they 
are coming for your firearms. 
Six weeks ago, it was the red flag 
law, where someone who doesn’t like 
you can report you to law enforcement 
or to a judge. There is a hearing that 
you can’t be at, your counsel can’t be 
present, you haven’t been charged with 
a crime, but they can take your fire-
arm, they can take your property, they 
can take away your Second Amend-
ment liberties, and then you have to 
petition for a subsequent hearing to 
get that right back. And you have done 
nothing wrong and have not been 
charged with a crime. 
Then House Democrats passed the 
unconstitutional legislation that said 
18- to 20-year-olds can’t purchase a fire-
arm. They can fight for our country, 
but they can’t purchase a firearm. And 
today they are coming for your guns, 24 
million of them. 
That is right, 24 million AR-style ri-
fles are in the hands of law-abiding 
Americans today, as we speak, and 
those individuals will not be able to 
sell or transfer that property. 
In the Heller case, the Supreme 
Court made clear that the Second 
Amendment protects firearms in com-
mon use at the time. During the mark-
up, Representative BISHOP asked the 
chairman: ‘‘Is it the point of the bill to 
ban weapons that are in common use in 
the United States today?’’ And the 
chairman said: ‘‘The problem is that 
they are in common use.’’ 
So, yes, this is the goal. This is why 
it is unconstitutional. Couldn’t be any 
clearer. Democrats don’t care what the 
Constitution says. 
Fortunately, courts are correctly ap-
plying the Constitution. Last week, a 
Federal District Court judge in Colo-
rado, who was appointed by President 
Obama, issued a temporary restraining 
order against the Town of Superior, 
Colorado, to prevent it from imple-
menting an assault weapon ban. 
The judge wrote: Plaintiffs have stat-
ed that semiautomatic weapons, as 
well as magazines that hold more than 
10 rounds, are commonly used by law- 
abiding citizens for lawful purposes 
and, therefore, cannot be banned. 
And guess what this bill will do? It 
won’t make communities safer. It 
won’t make them safer at all. In fact, 
in the Heller case, the Supreme Court 
said: The Second Amendment protects 
firearms in common use at the time 
and also said ‘‘for lawful purposes like 
self-defense.’’ 
Three weeks ago, July 7, 2022, a Flor-
ida homeowner used his AR-style rifle 
when individuals forcibly entered his 
home. After the homeowner opened 
fire, the individuals immediately fled. 
When asked if the homeowner would 
face charges, the Escambia County 
Sheriff Chip Simmons said: Absolutely 
not. The homeowner is protecting him-
self. And in Florida, you can do that. 
You can protect yourself. 
Democrats tried this ban before. It 
didn’t work. It won’t work now. 
You know what it will do? It will 
make communities, I think, less safe. 
What will make communities safer, 
though, is if Democrats stop defunding 
the police, stop cashless bail, and start 
prosecuting criminals. They are taking 
away firearms used for self-defense by 
law-abiding Americans. 
This bill is wrong. It will make com-
munities, I think, less safe, and it is 
unconstitutional.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7512 
July 29, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
great leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, more chil-
dren die from gun violence than any 
other cause—cancer, auto accidents, or 
any other cause. 
Our Nation has watched in unspeak-
able horror as assault weapons have 
been used in massacre after massacre 
in communities across the country. 
Disturbingly, so many of these mass 
shootings have targeted our precious 
children in their schools, at the mov-
ies, at the malls, and throughout our 
communities. 
That is why I rise today in strong 
support of reinstating the Assault 
Weapons Ban Act, a long overdue step 
to get deadly weapons off our streets. 
b 1600 
Make no mistake, we know that an 
assault weapon ban can work because 
it has worked before. For 10 years— 
from 1994 to 2004—our families were 
protected by a strong assault weapons 
ban strongly championed in the Senate 
by then-Senator, now-President Joe 
Biden. CHUCK
SCHUMER
led the way 
over here; DIANNE
FEINSTEIN
in the 
Senate. I was a relatively new Member 
of Congress who was whipping for this 
legislation. It made us all very proud. 
More importantly, it saved many lives. 
During that time, we witnessed gun 
crime with assault weapons drop by up 
to 40 percent. Let me repeat, gun vio-
lence with assault weapons reduced by 
40 percent. Meanwhile, since the ban 
expired, the number of mass shooting 
deaths has grown by nearly 500 percent. 
It is particularly sickening to now 
see these same deadly weapons—are 
you ready for this—being marketed to 
children. Here is an advertisement for 
a JR–15 designed to be a so-called 
‘‘smaller, safer, lighter’’ version of the 
horrific AR–15, which has been used to 
murder so many of their playmates and 
friends. Look at this, these little skulls 
with ponytails on it. 
The manufacturers stated that their 
‘‘goal was to develop a shooting plat-
form that was not only sized correctly 
. . . but also looks, feels, and operates 
just like mom and dad’s gun.’’ Mom 
and dad’s gun. They used that expres-
sion. 
Indeed, gunmaker WEE1 Tactical 
launched the JR–15 and said: ‘‘we are so 
excited to start capturing the imagina-
tion of the next generation.’’ 
Indeed, this callousness is disgusting. 
It is despicable, and it reminds us that 
the crisis of gun violence requires ac-
tion. 
To the families who are survivors and 
have suffered from gun violence, we 
have said over and over again, we will 
not stop until the job is done. We 
thank them for sharing their sorrow to 
help prevent others from suffering in 
that way. They have turned their 
agony into action. 
Now, whether we are saying we are 
going from Newtown to Uvalde and ev-
erything in between and since, there 
are so many deaths, so much sorrow, so 
much hope that we would get the job 
done. They are responsible for our 
bringing this legislation to the floor. 
Their outside mobilization, their advo-
cacy with great intellectual integrity 
has made all the difference. 
Today, House Democrats will vote to 
reinstate the assault weapons ban with 
strong protections for children and 
families. The bill prohibits the sale, 
manufacture, transfer, or possession of 
semiautomatic assault weapons, as 
well as high-capacity magazines. And 
contrary to what the gentleman on the 
other side of the aisle said, it requires 
safe storage for lawfully owned assault 
weapons already in our communities. 
It is not about taking guns away from 
people who should have them, it is 
about safe storage. Do you have a prob-
lem with that? 
It strongly supports our law enforce-
ment heroes who should not have to 
confront weapons designed for the bat-
tlefield instead in our communities. 
To be clear, this is a very special day 
in the Congress of the United States 
that history will record as one designed 
to save lives. 
For his passionate, persistent leader-
ship on this legislation, let me salute 
Congressman DAVID CICILLINE, who has 
been fighting ferociously on this issue 
for years and years. To LUCY MCBATH, 
who has been, again, a member of the 
committee of jurisdiction, an intellec-
tual resource, a strategic thinker, and 
an inspiration to all of us, who turned 
her personal grief into action and 
makes a difference, I thank her. I also 
thank Chairman JERRY NADLER, chair 
of the Judiciary Committee, for steer-
ing this legislation through the Judici-
ary Committee and to the floor. Also, I 
recognize, once again, President Joe 
Biden’s longtime leadership on this 
issue and the beautiful words he ex-
pressed about this when we were cele-
brating the bipartisan safety bill re-
cently. 
Mr. Speaker, all those who have had 
the privilege of serving in these hal-
lowed Halls take a solemn oath to the 
American people. At the heart of our 
oath is our duty to protect and defend 
the Constitution, the American people. 
With this legislation, we honor this 
foremost 
responsibility. 
When 
the 
House returns in August, we will bring 
to the floor a robust public safety 
package beyond this. Let me be clear: 
House Democrats are for people over 
politics and say to our friends in this 
body and down the hall and wherever 
they are: Your political survival is in-
significant compared to the survival of 
children who are at the mercy of these 
guns. 
We believe that every American de-
serves to live in a safe community 
where they and their families can 
thrive. That is why Democrats are 
funding our police while making re-
forms for better law enforcement train-
ing and accountability as we give them 
the tools they need to prevent crime. 
We are so proud of the work done by 
CBC chair JOYCE BEATTY working with 
Representatives JOSH GOTTHEIMER and 
ABIGAIL SPANBERGER to write historic 
legislation that prioritizes meeting the 
needs of our law enforcement officers 
while at the same time having account-
ability. That is historic. We haven’t 
done that before. 
I am more confident than ever that 
we will pass a package rooted in two of 
the Democrats’ most cherished values: 
justice and safety. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
assault 
weapons 
ban, 
recognizing, 
again, that the survival of our children 
is more important than the political 
survival of any of us. 
I urge a strong and, hopefully, bipar-
tisan vote to put people over politics 
by reinstating the assault weapons 
ban. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1808, the 
Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. 
Here they go again. 
Once again, my colleagues across the 
aisle have rushed to exploit your fear 
and the pain of victims to rush out a 
gun control measure that will do noth-
ing to save lives or address the root 
causes of violence. 
I say, ‘‘exploit your fear,’’ and I point 
to the Speaker of the House just stood 
in this well with a poster that had a 
toy gun on it and wants you to feel 
scared about that. Well, I have a 6- 
year-old son, and he has toy guns. He 
knows about muzzle discipline. He 
knows you don’t put your finger on the 
trigger. He knows you don’t point it at 
people. I am able to teach my son gun 
safety and make him safer. 
You don’t live through fear. This and 
other gun control measures like red 
flag laws, they make the other side feel 
better, but today’s bill will do nothing 
but disarm law-abiding citizens. 
Congress has tried this before. In 
1994, a 10-year assault weapons ban was 
first enacted. This ban did not stop vio-
lent crime or prevent heart-wrenching 
tragedies like Columbine. Yes, Col-
umbine happened while we had an as-
sault weapons ban. 
In fact, after the ban ended, the De-
partment of Justice issued a report 
that concluded: ‘‘Should it be renewed, 
the ban’s effects on gun violence are 
likely to be small at best and perhaps 
too small for reliable measurement. 
Assault weapons were rarely used in 
gun crimes even before the ban.’’ That 
is the Department of Justice. 
The results are in, folks. A so-called 
assault weapons ban does not work. 
But what it does is it takes away your 
rights and it leaves you vulnerable. 
The simple truth is criminals don’t 
follow the law. Think about this: If

criminals 
followed 
the 
law, 
we 
wouldn’t have any crime. But when 
you criminalize guns, only criminals 
are going to have guns. 
So I urge you to vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, law-abiding Americans are 
sick and tired of these political games that ex-
ploit the pain of victims of shootings but do not 
work and seriously threaten your rights and 
your safety. 
So today, I urge my colleagues to oppose 
this unconstitutional ban and ineffective gun 
control measure. 
Instead, I ask you again to please work with 
me to actually address the root causes of vio-
lence. 
We can pass bills like my STOP II, Secure 
Every School and Protect our Nation’s Chil-
dren Act today, which would protect schools, 
improve mental health, and save lives. 
We have solutions that work . . . without 
taking away your rights. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the sponsor of 
this bill and a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1808, the As-
sault Weapons Ban, legislation that 
will help reduce the gun massacres 
being committed in our communities 
by weapons of war. 
These military-style weapons were 
designed for the battlefield for max-
imum efficiency when a soldier is en-
gaged in combat. 
And the military features banned by 
this bill are added to make these guns 
more 
accurate, 
more 
controllable, 
more concealable, and more deadly, en-
abling killers to murder as many peo-
ple as possible as quickly as possible. 
These weapons have no place in our 
communities. They turn our streets, 
our schools, our grocery stores, our 
movie theaters, and hospitals into 
bloody battlefield scenes, and they kill 
our children, our friends, our neigh-
bors, and the police officers trying to 
protect them. 
In 2016 and 2017 alone, more than two 
dozen officers were slain in the line of 
duty by an assault weapon. One in five 
officers is killed in the line of duty by 
these weapons, which is why the Major 
City Police Chiefs Association endorses 
this legislation. 
Yet for nearly 18 years, we failed to 
take action to stop them from flooding 
into our communities and being used 
time and time and time again in mass 
shootings. 
It is unconscionable that anyone can 
walk into a store and legally purchase 
a weapon capable of inflicting the car-
nage we have seen in Highland Park, in 
Buffalo, in Uvalde, in Atlanta, in Suth-
erland Springs, in Las Vegas, in Or-
lando, in Parkland, and the list goes on 
and on. 
Today, the House is finally taking a 
long overdue and necessary step to re-
institute a ban on these exceptionally 
dangerous weapons. 
We didn’t just come up with this pro-
posal out of thin air and propose it, the 
original assault weapons ban was in 
place from 1994 to 2004, and we have 
clear evidence that it was effective in 
reducing these killings. 
Compared with the decade before its 
adoption, the 1994 assault weapons ban 
was associated with a 25 percent drop 
in gun massacres and a 40 percent drop 
in fatalities. 
As soon as the ban expired, fatalities 
and shootings skyrocketed again. 
When an assault weapon is used dur-
ing a mass shooting, six times as many 
people are shot. 
Today, I am imploring my colleagues 
to take action to get these weapons of 
war designed for maximum destruction 
of human life off our streets. 
Let me be clear: I respect the Second 
Amendment, but it is not without lim-
its. Imagine if we clung to the desire to 
protect our children and our commu-
nities as tightly as some of my col-
leagues cling to their rifles. 
There are more guns than people in 
this country, more mass shootings 
than days in the year. This is a unique-
ly American problem. 
This bill won’t stop all gun violence, 
but it will effectively decrease it. 
Because they were designed for mili-
tary combat, these weapons don’t just 
kill, they decimate. The shots fired can 
tear a softball-sized wound into a vic-
tim. 
We know how we can reduce the suf-
fering. Researchers estimate if we still 
had a Federal assault weapons ban, we 
would see a 70 percent decline in mass 
shooting deaths. Let that sink in. If 
the ban had remained in effect, 70 per-
cent of the families torn apart by these 
massacres would still have their loved 
ones. 
We can’t bring back 70 percent of 
these victims to their families and 
friends, but we can work to prevent 
more carnage moving forward. 
Let me end by saying this: In my 
faith tradition, we were taught that 
whoever destroys a soul it is considered 
as if they destroyed an entire world; 
and whoever saves a life, it is consid-
ered as if they saved an entire world. 
Let’s come together to save lives. 
Pass this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, 
America doesn’t have a gun violence 
problem, we have a human violence 
problem. But those across the aisle 
don’t want to talk about that because 
then you have to talk about the cul-
ture of death that we have created in 
this country. Killing 63 million unborn 
children. Denying the sanctity of life. 
That is the conversation that they 
don’t want to have. 
Mr. Speaker, as a former police offi-
cer, I have encountered many dan-
gerous 
people 
with 
guns, 
and 
we 
stopped them before they hurt them-
selves or others. We identified them. 
We identified the threats that they 
were making. Then we were able to in-
tervene and stop those individuals be-
fore they became a shooter. 
That is what we should be focused on 
in the wake of these recent tragedies. 
Give law enforcement the tools and re-
sources to stop those who have shown a 
propensity to become violent. That is 
what we should be focusing on, not 
defunding the police, not demoralizing 
the police, not delegitimizing the po-
lice. We should be focused on assisting 
the police and identifying these indi-
viduals who want to commit crime. 
b 1615 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ica doesn’t have to be the only country 
where mass shootings occur, some-
times daily. 
Sometimes I hear people say, ‘‘Well, 
it is a mental health problem.’’ I will 
tell you what, people have mental 
health problems in countries all over 
the world, but only one country has 
mass shootings the way America does. 
We need to have an answer to this. 
The killer that killed my constitu-
ents at the Gilroy Garlic Festival 
couldn’t buy the assault weapon in 
California, so he just went over to Ne-
vada and bought it there. 
We need a national answer. We know 
it works. When the last ban expired, 
the number of mass shooting deaths in-
creased by 483 percent. 
Americans deserve to be safe and to 
be free, free of fear that when their 
kids go to school, they will be obliter-
ated. We need to put the American peo-
ple ahead of politics. We need to put 
American children ahead of politics. 
We need to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we do have a culture of 
human violence. Recently, a 16-year- 
old young man with three felony ar-
rests in the past 4 months violently at-
tacked and attempted to choke a New 
York subway police officer. He was re-
leased without bail. That is what is 
happening where you have the left in 
charge of criminal justice systems. 
Why do I bring that up? Because that 
individual punched that police officer 
more than 20 times in his attempts to 
basically kill that officer. Personal 
weapons such as hands, fists, or feet ac-
counted for 600 homicides in 2019, ac-
cording to official reports. Mr. Speak-
er, 1,476 murders were committed with 
knives or cutting instruments, and 364 
homicides were committed with rifles. 
Do you see the distinction here? But 
what the Democrats are going for is 
they want to take away someone’s con-
stitutional right instead of enforcing 
the law for people who are criminally 
violent. They are going to release those 
people back into your streets. 
The Supreme Court has held the Sec-
ond Amendment protects arms in com-
mon use. But at markup, Chairman

July 29, 2022 
NADLER admitted that the purpose of 
the bill is to ban firearms that are in 
common use. Think about that. That 
does violence to the Constitution. They 
simply want to ban guns, and this is 
just another step along that path. 
At markup, it became very clear that 
Democrats don’t even understand the 
guns that they are trying to ban, but 
they don’t care because when they say 
they want to put politics above people, 
or that we shouldn’t, what they really 
mean is they are going to. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
a member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
think that we will spend most of our 
time here today where facts will be 
told and then rhetorical conversations 
will be told, as well. 
Fact: The Constitution, in the Sec-
ond Amendment, does not prohibit the 
ban on assault weapons. 
Fact: H.R. 1808, led by Mr. CICILLINE, 
allows gun owners to hold their guns. 
This deals with the transfer of guns. 
Fact: As we can see, the lives of our 
children are lost through carnage, 
bloodshed, and murder—fact—by the 
hands of an AR–15, an assault-style 
weapon. 
Fact: Our fellow citizens are killed 
by an AR–15, -14, an assault-style weap-
on. 
Fact: Mass carnage is not done by a 
knife, a BB gun. It is not done by 
throwing a water bomb or words. It is 
not done by taking a bus and running 
over citizens. It is done by assault- 
style weapons. 
So, I rise today to support H.R. 1808 
because I am tired of a fact of doing 
nothing. 
Mayor Bowser has a right to com-
plain about Governor Abbott gener-
ating individuals unfairly, unjustly, 
and wrongly to another jurisdiction. 
But the fact is that these weapons have 
killed. 
So, without any concern, we are now 
offering facts. Anyone that suggests 
that we are taking guns from good gun 
owners, we are not. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include in the RECORD three ar-
ticles from The Washington Post, CBS 
News, and KXAN. 
UVALDE PARENTS, HIGHLAND PARK SURVIVORS 
DEMAND ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN 
(By Ellie Silverman) 
Kimberly Rubio keeps trying to picture 
the classroom through her 10-year-old daugh-
ter Lexi’s eyes, haunted by the different 
ways that May day could have ended. 
What side of the room did Lexi run toward 
with her classmates, huddling and fearing for 
their lives? What if Rubio had taken her 
daughter home earlier after an award cere-
mony that day? What if the outside door 
locked properly? What if police had imme-
diately engaged the suspected gunman? 
But the one question that lawmakers 
should ask themselves every morning and 
night, she posed, was: ‘‘What if the gunman 
never had access to an assault weapon?’’ 
‘‘We are no longer asking for change,’’ 
Rubio, 33, said to a cheering crowd of about 
200 people at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. 
‘‘We are demanding it.’’ 
Rubio was one of several people who spoke 
at a rally about the ways gun violence had 
irreparably harmed their lives and demanded 
a federal ban on assault weapons. 
Those gathered wore bright orange shirts 
and included community members from 
Highland Park, Ill., where a gunman killed 
seven adults and injured dozens more during 
a Fourth of July parade, and parents of chil-
dren who were among the 21 people killed in 
May at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, 
Tex. 
Rubio’s 
daughter 
Alexandria 
Aniyah 
Rubio, known as Lexi, was one of the chil-
dren killed. 
Many openly grieved at the rally, crying 
during Rubio’s remarks. A mother at the 
Highland Park parade recounted how she 
fled, holding her 1-year-old daughter in her 
arms as she was grazed by a bullet. Parents 
shared the terrifying questions they’re hear-
ing from their young children who survived 
shootings. And speaker after speaker de-
manded more sweeping federal action to curb 
the scourge of gun violence. 
Last month, President Biden signed a bi-
partisan gun-control bill into law, the most 
significant of its kind in three decades. It ex-
pands criminal background checks for some 
gun buyers, bars a larger group of domestic- 
violence offenders from purchasing firearms, 
and funds programs that would allow au-
thorities to seize guns from troubled individ-
uals. However, gun control advocates, and 
Biden himself, have noted that the legisla-
tion does not include everything they hoped 
for. 
During an event on the White House’s 
South Lawn on Monday billed as ‘‘com-
memorating the historic achievement of the 
passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act,’’ the father of a 17-year-old boy killed in 
the 2018 massacre at a high school in Park-
land, Fla., heckled the president. demanding 
more action to curb gun violence. Biden re-
newed calls for a federal ban on assault 
weapons 
and 
high-capacity 
ammunition 
magazines. 
On Wednesday, mothers continued to step 
up to the lectern near the grassy area by 1st 
and C streets NE and speak about their chil-
dren, friends and relatives who died of gun 
violence and the ways survivors grapple with 
anxiety attacks, fear and guilt. Democratic 
lawmakers from Illinois, including Sen. 
Tammy Duckworth; Rep. Brad Schneider, 
whose district includes Highland Park; and 
Rep. Jan Schakowsky, also spoke at the 
rally before the crowd marched toward the 
Capitol. 
Nubia Hogan, 45, stood among the crowd 
and held a poster with a photo of her father, 
Eduardo Uvaldo. 
Uvaldo was at the July Fourth parade with 
Hogan and their relatives when gunfire 
rained on the crowd. The parade was a fam-
ily tradition and Uvaldo’s favorite holiday, 
she said. 
Hogan said she thought about how when 
gunfire erupted from a nearby rooftop, she 
froze. Her son, Brian Hogan, 13, yelled to run 
and the family tried to flee. A bullet hit 
Brian in the arm and fragments hit Nubia 
Hogan’s mother, too. Uvaldo was also struck 
and was rushed to the hospital, where he died 
two days later. 
‘‘I get anxiety really bad. I get nightmares, 
waking up to hearing ‘boom boom’ like the 
shots,’’ said Nubia Hogan, of Waukegan, Ill. 
‘‘These types of guns should not be out there 
for civilians. These are for the military and 
for police.’’ 
She plans to continue with activism 
around this issue, joining the many other 
people who have channeled their grief into 
advocacy for change. Thousands of people 
gathered earlier this summer on the Na-
tional Mall to join the rally staged by March 
for Our Lives, the organization founded by 
student survivors of the mass shooting in 
Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people. 
Still, more than 115,000 students have been 
exposed to gun violence on K–12 campuses 
during regular hours since the Parkland 
massacre, according to a Washington Post 
database. 
Brett Cross, 39, stood toward the back of 
the crowd and said he thought about his 
nephew, 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, and how 
the ‘‘system’’ didn’t protect his family and 
so many others. The day of the shooting in 
Uvalde, his wife raced over to the school 
where Cross said police pushed and blocked 
parents from entering the building to save 
their children. 
In the first classroom the gunman entered, 
Cross said, was his nephew, ‘‘Uzi,’’ the young 
boy who was fast, always racing people, and 
who aspired to make music, be a YouTuber 
and one day become a police officer to help 
people. 
‘‘Those same cops that he looked up to 
failed him and his classmates,’’ Cross said. 
His 10-year-old son and Uzi shared a room 
together but now, his son doesn’t want to be 
in there. Cross bought a cot and placed it 
next to his bed, where the two hold hands be-
fore falling asleep. 
‘‘He said he wanted to go to school that 
day so that he could have done something,’’ 
Cross said. ‘‘He wants to know why an 18- 
year-old kid can go buy these weapons, why 
it took his brother from him.’’

GUNMAKERS MADE OVER $1 BILLION
IN AS-
SAULT WEAPON SALES IN THE PAST DECADE, 
CONGRESSIONAL REPORT FINDS 
(By Clare Hymes) 
An investigation by the House Oversight 
and Reform Committee found that manufac-
turers of the firearms used in some of the na-
tion’s deadliest mass shootings have made 
over $1 billion in revenue from military-style 
assault-rifles in the past decade. 
The committee said the industry reaped 
those profits in part through marketing and 
sales tactics aimed at enticing civilians into 
purchasing 
military-style 
weapons—espe-
cially targeting younger men with opportu-
nities to purchase expensive firearms on 
credit, and by subtly referencing extremist 
groups, for instance invoking imagery iden-
tified with these groups. The findings were 
published ahead of an Oversight Committee 
hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday on the 
marketing practices and the profits of the 
country’s top five gun manufacturers. 
Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney 
said the companies market the weapons ‘‘to 
children, preying on young men’s insecu-
rities, and even appealing to violent white 
supremacists.’’ 
During the hearing, the committee heard 
from the CEOs of two of those manufactur-
ers, Christopher Killoy, president and chief 
executive of Sturm, Ruger & Co, and Marty 
Daniel, CEO of Daniel Defense. A rifle used 
in the recent mass shooting at Robb Elemen-
tary School in Uvalde, Texas, that was used 
to kill 21 students and teachers was made by 
Daniel Defense. 
Smith & Wesson, President and CEO, Mark 
P. Smith was invited to testify but ulti-
mately did not appear at the hearing. The 
committee announced it will be subpoenaing 
the company for documents. 
‘‘A firearm, any firearm, can be used for 
good or for evil. The difference is in the in-
tent of the individual possessing it, which we 
respectfully submit should be the focus of 
any investigation into the root causes of 
criminal violence involving firearms,’’ Killoy

told the committee in his opening state-
ment. ‘‘ 
The committee, which was led by the 
Democratic lawmakers, produced an inves-
tigation into Smith & Wesson, Bushmaster, 
Ruger, Daniel Defense and Sig Sauer that al-
leged that the manufacturers engaged in 
‘‘disturbing sales tactics’’ that targeted 
young men as a means to ‘‘prove their manli-
ness,’’ according to the report. 
The committee also noted that despite the 
rise in gun violence and the pervasiveness of 
mass shootings, that rifle sales have contin-
ued to increase. 
Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the 
firearms used at the massacres in Highland 
Park, Parkland, and San Bernardino, has 
made at least $695 million in revenue from 
AR–1–style rifle sales alone in the past dec-
ade. Between 2019 and 2021, its revenues more 
than doubled from all long guns, from $108 
million to $253 million. 
Daniel Defense tripled its revenues of its 
AR–15–style rifles from $40 million in 2019 to 
over $120 million in 2021. Since 2012 Daniel 
Defense has made $528 Million from AR–15 
style rifles. 
Ruger’s earnings followed a similar trend, 
tripling from $39 million in 2019 to over $103 
million in 2021. Over the past decade its AR– 
15–style firearm revenue totaled $514 million. 
Ruger’s weapons were used in the massacres 
at Sutherland Springs that left 25 dead, and 
Boulder, Colorado, resulting in the deaths of 
10 people. 
Sig Sauer refused to provide the com-
mittee with figures that would detail the 
revenues from AR–15 style rifles. Its firearms 
were used in the mass shootings at the Pulse 
Nightclub in Orlando, which killed 49 people, 
and at a Las Vegas music festival where 60 
died. 
Bushmaster only provided the committee 
with revenue figures for 2021, citing its re-
cent acquisition by another company, and 
disclosed that it had earned $2.9 million from 
the sales of AR–15–style rifles. Bushmaster 
firearms were used in the racially motivated 
shooting in Buffalo, New York that killed 10 
people, and in the 2012 mass shooting at 
Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, 
Connecticut, where 27 died. 
Maloney, said the committee found the 
manufacturers had engaged in ‘‘dangerous 
marketing tactics’’ as part of their efforts to 
sell assault weapons. 
‘‘None of these companies take even basic 
steps to monitor the deaths and injuries 
caused by their products,’’ Maloney said. 
‘‘That is beyond irresponsible.’’ 
She asked the CEOs of Ruger and Daniel 
Defense 
whether 
they 
would 
accept 
responsibiity for their companies’ roles in 
mass murders that took place in places like 
Southerland Springs, Highland Park and 
Uvalde, and whether they would apologize to 
victims and their families. 
‘‘Chairwoman Maloney, these acts are 
committed by murderers. The murderers are 
responsible,’’ Daniel replied. 
‘‘Congresswoman, with all due respect, 
while I grieve like all Americans at these 
tragic incidents,’’ Killoy said. ‘‘To blame the 
firearm is [to blame] an inanimate object.’’ 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
advocates 
from 
Everytown for Gun Safety filed a complaint 
with the Federal Trade Commission, asking 
it to investigate the marketing practices of 
Daniel Defense, alleging the manufacturer 
violates the law by ‘‘marketing assault 
weapons to the civilian market with violent 
and militaristic imagery’’ and ‘‘appealing 
particularly to the thrill-seeking and impul-
sive tendencies of susceptible teens and 
young men who are attracted to violence and 
military fantasies.’’ 
The FTC declined to comment regarding 
investigation requests but told CBS News it 
has not taken any legal action against gun 
manufacturers. CBS News has reviewed simi-
lar complaints against gun manufacturers 
brought to the FTC since 1996 but has not 
found any evidence that the agency has ever 
taken any action against the industry for its 
marketing practices. 
Daniel Defense’s marketing has drawn par-
ticular scrutiny since the Uvalde shooting 
for targeting ‘‘at-risk young men.’’ Its 
Instagram account features photos of mem-
bers of the military holding its weapons, as 
well as celebrities such as actor Josh Brolin 
in ‘‘Sicario 2’’ and Post Malone wielding its 
products. Promotional videos from the man-
ufacturer also feature dramatizations of law 
enforcement and military drills using their 
weapons. 
The committee’s report cites Palmetto 
State Armory’s ‘‘Big Igloo Aloha’’ AK–47– 
style assault rifle which is designed with a 
floral pattern, a reference to the Boogaloo 
movement, a violent far right, anti-govern-
ment group which is often associated with 
wearing floral-print shirts. The committee 
found 
that 
Daniel 
Defense 
posted 
an 
lnstagram photo in June 2021 of its M4A1 as-
sault rifle that had been accessorized with a 
similar floral pattern. 
The committee began investigating the 
manufacturers in May after the mass shoot-
ings in Uvalde and Buffalo. 
None of the five manufacturers imme-
diately responded to CBS News’ request for 
comment. 
The House is scheduled to vote on Friday 
on the first assault weapons ban proposed 
since 1994. 
‘I WILL NOT LET MY STUDENTS DIE IN VAIN’: 
UVALDE
TEACHER
CALLS
FOR
ASSAULT 
WEAPONS BAN IN HIS TOWN 
(By Jala Washington) 
UVALDE, TEXAS (Nexstar).—There’s now a 
petition to stop the sale of all assault rifles 
in Uvalde. Who is the one helping lead this 
effort? A teacher who watched his students 
be murdered and wounded himself. 
Arnulfo Reyes, posted on his Facebook 
page on Wednesday saying: ‘‘I meant what I 
said and said what I meant. I will not let my 
students die in vain. Now Uvalde back me 
up. #uvaldeatrong.’’ 
This comes just over two months after he 
lost his students in the May 24 Robb Elemen-
tary School shooting. 
The petition is addressed to Randy Klein, 
the principal owner of the Oasis Outback. 
It’s a bar and grill that also sells ‘‘archery 
supplies including ammunition, targets, tree 
stands, fishing rods, reels, and tackle,’’ ac-
cording to its website. 
The Oasis is where the accused Uvalde gun-
man bought the rifle—within days of his 18th 
birthday—according to investigators. 
The petition authors are a group called, 
‘‘Uvalde Strong for Gun Safety.’’ They 
wrote: 
Mr. Klein, 
As you know, on May 24, 2022, a massacre 
occurred in our community at Robb Elemen-
tary School that resulted in the untimely 
and tragic death of nineteen children and 
two teachers. It was an assault rifle pur-
chased at your place of business that was 
used in the shooting. This tragedy will unde-
niably negatively impact the community at 
large for generations to come. Therefore, we 
write to you today with great urgency. 
Soon after the murders befell our town, we 
formed an organization called Uvalde Strong 
for Gun Safety. Many citizens from Uvalde 
and the surrounding areas are members of 
this group, as well as individuals from all 
over the country. We recognize that Oasis 
Outback has positively served the commu-
nity in several ways and performs a vital 
role in contributing to our municipality’s vi-
brancy. The members of this group feel 
strongly about our second amendment rights 
and support your establishment’s commit-
ment to selling guns and ammunition. How-
ever, we come to you today with a request. 
Out of RESPECT for and in support of 
those affected by this catastrophe, we 
strongly urge you to cease the sale of assault 
rifles and the ammunition paired with them. 
In addition, we ask that you discontinue the 
handling of gun transfers of this style of fire-
arm from gun retail stores and manufactur-
ers. Doing so will ensure that children across 
Uvalde County will never have to worry 
about a new purchase of this type of weapon. 
We hope you will comply with our request 
over the next thirty days. 
Stand with us! Your support will help us 
heal as a community. We thank you for your 
time. 
Sincerely, 
UVALDE STRONG FOR GUN SAFETY. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for H.R. 1808. That is 
a fact. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1808, 
the ‘‘Assault Weapons Ban of 2022,’’ that 
would prohibit the sale, manufacture, transfer, 
or possession of semiautomatic assault weap-
ons and large capacity ammunition feeding 
devices. 
Whether we call them assault weapons or 
AR–15 style weapons, we all know that we 
are talking about civilian versions of firearms 
created for the military. 
Day after day, mass shooting after mass 
shooting, we are confronted with the carnage 
that is inflicted on the human body when these 
weapons of war are used against elementary- 
aged children, teachers, parade-goers, high 
school students, worshippers, shoppers, and 
on and on. 
In America, gun violence is the leading 
cause of death among children while mass 
shootings occur ever increasingly each year. 
It is no secret that I am adamantly opposed 
to assault weapons and large capacity maga-
zines—implements designed for war. Neither 
belong in our communities. 
Since the time I first joined my colleagues in 
the House in 2003 to extend the Assault 
Weapons Ban of 1994, we have seen innu-
merable acts of violence and carnage per-
petrated using assault weapons and large ca-
pacity magazines. 
I have hugged far too many grieving 
spouses and friends, wiped away the tears of 
too many loved ones left behind to pick up the 
pieces, and offered condolences to countless 
communities across the country—including my 
own. 
There is no debating that when paired to-
gether, large capacity magazines and assault 
weapons perform as they were designed—kill-
ing more people quickly and efficiently. 
We all know that the parents in Uvalde were 
asked to provide DNA swabs to identify their 
murdered children because they were unrec-
ognizable. I am tired of seeing parents bury 
their children—tired of promising that we in 
Congress will remove these military-style 
weapons from our communities—then, return-
ing and doing nothing. 
H.R. 1808 will help gradually reduce the 
number of assault weapons and large capacity 
magazines available—keeping them out of the 
hands of criminals—while reducing the num-
ber of lives lost to gun violence, and making 
us all safer, the bill still recognizes that many 
Americans already own assault weapons and

large capacity magazines and provides ways 
in which they can keep their firearms, transfer 
them following a background check. 
The evidence is clear. Bans work. During 
the 1994 federal assault weapons ban was in 
effect, mass shooting fatalities were 70 per-
cent less likely to occur. And, when the large 
capacity ammunition feeding device ban was 
in place, there were 77 percent fewer injuries 
from guns. 
In the past decade, gun makers have flood-
ed the market with assault weapons, making 
over $1 billion in sales, but at a tragic cost to 
the rest of us. 
From 2000 to 2004, the average number of 
people killed from active shooter incidents per 
year was 22. But from 2005 to 2021, the aver-
age number of people killed from active shoot-
er incidents was 68.7. 
We know the common denominator here— 
assault weapons and large capacity maga-
zines—and H.R. 1808 is the solution. It is time 
to act. 
H.R. 1808 is a necessary measure that will 
protect Americans and promote public safety. 
We should all be tired of bracing ourselves for 
the next attack on another unsuspecting gath-
ering of Americans going about their daily 
lives or identifying the nearest exits as we sit 
and try to enjoy time with our loved ones or 
hearing children tell us about the active shoot-
er drills they participate in at school or camp. 
I thank Representative DAVID CICILLINE for 
his leadership on this important measure.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, here is 
the fact. This bill is unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court made clear the 
Second Amendment protects firearms 
in common use. This bill has eight 
pages of weapons and firearms that it 
bans, including 24 million firearms that 
law-abiding American citizens possess 
today. That is the fact. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my 
good friend from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the previous assault 
weapons ban that was referenced by 
our Speaker, I just want to make sure 
our record is actually correct. The FBI 
that kept the data had to admit that, 
as sympathetic as they were to an as-
sault weapons ban, actually, it doesn’t 
appear to have really made any dif-
ference. 
If we want to talk about crime since 
then, we can talk about the big cities 
that have come under the control of 
Democratic 
authority, 
who 
have 
pushed for things like no bond. 
John Adams had it exactly right. 
This Constitution is intended for a 
moral and religious people. It is wholly 
inadequate for the governing of any 
other. So, we are either going to have 
to get rid of all of our constitutional 
rights—we can’t even allow freedom of 
an assembly or speech, much less the 
Second Amendment, if we are not 
going to teach moral right and wrong. 
What are we finding? We are finding 
in our schools, of course, that they are 
not teaching the Ten Commandments. 
Instead, they are teaching to envy. 
Look around, covet, see who has some-
thing more than you, and you should 
envy and covet. 
Just keep in mind, under the big city 
laws now, if you get violent, we will 
give you no bond. We will let you right 
back out. 
Do you want to know what would do 
more right now than banning AR–15s? 
It would be to ban Democrat thinking 
in the big cities that is allowing the 
crime rates to just explode. 
We have always had guns in America. 
That is why there is an America. But 
we never had a time like this when we 
were teaching our children everything 
but the moral imperatives. 
That is why this bill needs to go 
down, and we need to go after the 
causes of our violence. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), a 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of reinstating the as-
sault weapons ban. 
This bill would put military-grade as-
sault weapons out of circulation for ci-
vilians. For me, the choice between 
banning 
assault 
weapons 
and 
pro-
tecting young, innocent children is a 
no-brainer. I put children above guns. 
It pains me deeply that the children 
in our communities live in fear of sud-
denly losing their lives or the lives of 
loved ones on a daily basis. 
I am a gun owner myself, Mr. Speak-
er. I was raised on a farm in south 
Texas, and I know how to use a gun, es-
pecially for hunting. But assault weap-
ons are not for hunting. They are used 
to kill people quickly, efficiently, and 
as fast as they can. That type of weap-
on is used solely for that, for killing 
people, and it has no place in our com-
munities. 
One child’s life is worth more than 
all the assault weapons in the world. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
My fellow Americans, the Democrats 
are coming for your guns. This assault 
weapons ban is unconstitutional be-
cause it would ban firearms that are 
currently in common use, making the 
scope of the bill, a semiautomatic as-
sault weapons ban, overly broad by 
capturing millions of sporting rifles, 
shotguns, and pistols that simply have 
certain accessories and cosmetic fea-
tures. In fact, the bill focuses mostly 
on appearance, which would arbitrarily 
ban some firearm models while ex-
empting 
others 
with 
the 
same 
functionality. 
This bill would not reduce violent 
crime, as Democrats claim. Studies 
have shown that the effect of the last 
assault weapons ban in 1994 on violent 
crime was perhaps too small for a reli-
able measurement. Instead, what this 
bill and all other legislation from 
Democrats aimed at gun control would 
do is directly infringe on the rights of 
law-abiding Americans. 
They are not going to stop here. 
There will always be a scary-looking 
gun that they think needs to be 
banned. There will always be another 
loophole that they have created out of 
thin air that they need to close with 
more bans. 
Mr. Speaker, this document says 
‘‘shall not be infringed.’’ I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE), a member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1808. 
As the Chair, my fellow Coloradan, 
knows, just last year, we mourned the 
loss of 10 individuals who were shot, 
murdered, at a grocery store in Boul-
der, Colorado, in my district. Last 
week, we honored the 10-year anniver-
sary of the Aurora, Colorado, movie 
theater shooting. 
The people in our communities fear 
whether they are even safe to walk 
into their local grocery store and buy 
food for their families without the 
threat of gun violence. 
Since the Federal assault weapons 
ban expired in 2004, the scourge of gun 
violence has only grown more perva-
sive across our country. 
We have come together in the past to 
protect our communities. In 1994, law-
makers from both sides of the aisle

joined together to pass a similar piece 
of legislation to that that we are vot-
ing on today. 
I humbly ask my colleagues that we 
do the same this evening. Let’s pass 
this bill for our children and for safer 
communities. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I am voting 
against the erosion of constitutional 
rights of law-abiding Americans. 
In the long history of mankind, free-
dom and liberty are not lost overnight. 
It comes by way of a slow and gradual 
burn. 
We have seen an unprecedented as-
sault on our First Amendment through 
the legacy media and social media gi-
ants censoring the thoughts and opin-
ions of individuals of the right while 
propping up their favorite candidates 
and covering up stories that could be 
detrimental to their public personas. 
Policies are then implemented that 
are 
antireligious 
freedom, 
anti-due 
process, anti-free assembly, and, today, 
anti-Second Amendment, the right to 
bear arms. These rights shall not be in-
fringed. 
Instead of making families and com-
munities safer, this backward, gun- 
grabbing attempt does nothing to 
harden school security, address our 
mental health crisis, or reverse the de-
preciation of our morals and values. 
No, it does nothing for that, but it 
tears at the fabric of our Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
protect the Constitution and vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. DEAN), a member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have four grand-
children. The youngest, Scottie, was 
born just last year, in 2021. In Scottie’s 
world, guns kill more kids than cars 
do. 
b 1630 
In Scottie’s world there are 692 mass 
shootings every year, and when she 
goes off to school, Scottie will learn 
her active shooter drills as she learns 
to tie her shoes. We don’t have to live 
like this if we all only had the courage 
to pass the assault weapons ban to reg-
ulate semiautomatic guns. Our gun vi-
olence crisis demands this and other 
solutions. This will save lives. 
Experts reveal that the casualties of 
mass shootings would have dropped by 
70 percent if the last assault weapons 
ban had stayed in place. 
How will I explain to Scottie that the 
other side boasts of 24 million assault- 
style weapons in the hands of Ameri-
cans and says not one word about the 
24,000 people dead in just 7 months of 
this year from guns? 
We must act. Join me. Have the cour-
age to join me. Pass the assault weap-
ons ban for Scottie’s future and for all 
of our children. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Fact: This assault weapons ban bill is 
unconstitutional. 
Chairman 
NADLER 
even recognized, when he stated that 
‘‘the problem is that these weapons are 
in common use.’’ And in Heller, the Su-
preme Court ruled that the Bill of 
Rights clearly protects firearms in 
common use. This is an unconstitu-
tional piece of legislation. 
Fact: The assault weapons bill will 
ban weapons in common use, and my 
colleague will most assuredly target 
citizens to take their guns. 
In the words of Democratic perpetual 
candidate Beto O’Rourke: Hell, yes, we 
are going to take your AR–15 and your 
AK–47. 
That is the truth, and everyone 
knows it. Don’t hide behind it. Every-
body knows precisely what my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
are doing. 
Fact: Less than 2 percent of all pris-
oners had a firearm obtained from a re-
tail source at the time they committed 
their crimes. Only 13 percent of the of-
fenders in State prison populations ob-
tained 
their 
firearms 
from 
retail 
stores. Criminals usually don’t get 
their guns at gun stores through legal 
channels. That is a fact. 
Another fact: Upwards of 80 percent 
crimes are committed by people with 
prior arrest records, often by people 
with 
prior 
convictions 
for 
violent 
crimes or prior weapons offenses, and 
almost none of our gun control pro-
posals—and particularly this one—are 
targeting this group. That is the truth. 
Those are the facts. The fact is, as 
Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘The strongest 
reason for the people to retain the 
right to keep and bear arms is, as a 
last 
resort, 
to 
protect 
themselves 
against tyranny in government.’’ 
This is the precise kind of tyranny 
that my colleagues are exercising 
today, precisely when they are opening 
our borders up to lawless cartels and 
gangs, and precisely when they are 
defunding the police. Precisely when 
they are making our communities un-
safe, they want to limit the ability of 
the American people to defend them-
selves and to exercise their Second 
Amendment rights to protect their 
families. 
That is what is happening on the 
floor so my colleagues can appeal to 
their liberal White voters while they 
ignore the Black men and women and 
Brown men and women who are buying 
weapons to defend themselves in crimi-
nal hellholes in our country. 
Mr. NADLER. Fact: Contrary to Mr. 
ROY, this bill takes away nobody’s 
weapons because existing weapons are 
grandfathered in if he would only read 
the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. ESCOBAR), who is a member of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the assault 
weapons ban which will save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, El Paso is coming up on 
a terrible anniversary. On August 3, 
2019, my district was the site of the 
deadliest targeted attack on Latinos in 
modern history. Three years later, my 
constituents are still recovering from 
their injuries. 
Because Republicans have decided 
that unfettered access to assault weap-
ons is worth the routine slaughter of 
Americans, the domestic terrorist who 
attacked my community was able to do 
so with a legally purchased assault 
weapon. 
What was once an unthinkable trag-
edy—the mass carnage we saw in El 
Paso—is 
now 
commonplace 
across 
America. Americans are fed up, and so 
am I. 
Republicans 
have 
done 
nothing 
meaningful and hide behind thoughts 
and prayers—a phrase so empty and de-
void of action that Congress is rou-
tinely and deservedly mocked for it. 
So, Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to 
act. I am proud to vote on the assault 
weapon ban for El Paso, for Uvalde, 
and for countless other communities, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today the Democrats give new 
meaning to the term progressive. This 
is the first time in American history, I 
believe, that a Chamber of the Con-
gress will pass a bill openly defying the 
Supreme Court’s explicit declaration of 
the constitutional rights of the Amer-
ican people. 
It represents the farthest-ever reach 
of the Democrats’ long-pursued mas-
sive resistance doctrine. 
In markup I asked if any Democrat 
disputed that this bill bans guns and 
magazines in common use. Chairman 
NADLER
candidly responded: ‘‘That’s 
the point of the bill.’’ 
In other words, the essence of the bill 
is to stop commerce in weapons as al-
ternatively described by the Court in 
Heller in 2008 as those ‘‘typically pos-
sessed by law-abiding citizens for law-
ful purposes.’’ 
Heller explained the origins of the 
right to keep and bear arms in militia 
service. Ordinarily, when called for mi-
litia service, able-bodied men were ex-
pected to appear bearing arms supplied 
by themselves and of the kind in com-
mon use at the time. 
The Supreme Court further explained 
we also recognize another important 
limitation on the right to keep and 
bear and carry arms. In Miller it said, 
as we have explained, that the sort of 
weapons protected were those ‘‘in com-
mon use at the time.’’ 
This was explained and recapitulated 
in Bruen just a month ago on June 23, 
and we see repeatedly that this is being

defied. In fact, 1 week after Bruen, the 
Supreme Court granted petitions for 
certiorari, vacated, and remanded one 
State ban on MSRs and a State ban on 
magazines in common use to be recon-
sidered. 
This is in defiance of the Supreme 
Court. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, contrary 
to Mr. ROY, I include in the RECORD a 
report from Third Way titled ‘‘The Red 
State Murder Problem’’. 
[From Third Way, Mar.15, 2022] 
THE RED STATE MURDER PROBLEM 
(By Kylie Murdock and Jim Kessler) 
Every news outlet from FOX to CNN to 
The New York Times to local newspapers has 
a story with attention-grabbing headlines 
like ‘‘US cities hit all-time murder records.’’ 
Fox News and Republicans have jumped on 
this and framed it as a ‘‘Democrat’’ problem. 
They blame it on Democrat’s ‘‘soft-on- 
crime’’ approach and have even referred to a 
New York District Attorney’s approach as 
‘‘hug-a-thug.’’ Many news stories outside of 
Fox have also purported that police reform is 
responsible for this rise in murder and have 
pointed to cities like New York and Los An-
geles. 
There is a measure of truth to these sto-
ries. The US saw an alarming 30% increase in 
murder in 2020. While 2021 data is not yet 
complete, murder was on the rise again this 
past year. Some ‘‘blue’’ cities, like Chicago, 
Baltimore, and Philadelphia, have seen real 
and persistent increases in homicides. These 
cities—along with others like Los Angeles, 
New York, and Minneapolis—are also in 
places with wall-to-wall media coverage and 
national media interest. 
But there is a large piece of the homicide 
story that is missing and calls into question 
the veracity of the right-wing obsession over 
homicides in Democratic cities: murder rates 
are far higher in Trump-voting red states 
than Biden-voting blue states. And some-
times, murder rates are highest in cities 
with Republican mayors. 
For example, Jacksonville, a city with a 
Republican mayor, had 128 more murders in 
2020 than San Francisco, a city with a Demo-
crat mayor, despite their comparable popu-
lations. In fact, the homicide rate in Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco was half that 
of 
House 
Republican 
Leader 
Kevin 
McCarthy’s Bakersfield, a city with a Repub-
lican mayor that overwhelmingly voted for 
Trump. Yet there is barely a whisper, let 
alone an outcry, over the stunning levels of 
murders in these and other places. 
We collected 2019 and 2020 murder data 
from all 50 states. (Comprehensive 2021 data 
is not yet available.) We pulled the data from 
yearly crime reports released by state gov-
ernments, specifically the Departments of 
Justice and Safety. For states that didn’t 
issue state crime reports, we pulled data 
from reputable local news sources. To allow 
for comparison, we calculated the state’s per 
capita murder rate, the number of murders 
per 100,000 residents, and categorized states 
by their presidential vote in the 2020 elec-
tion, resulting in an even 25–25 split. 
We found that murder rates are, on aver-
age, 40% higher in the 25 states Donald 
Trump won in the last presidential election 
compared to those that voted for Joe Biden. 
In addition, murder rates in many of these 
red states dwarf those in blue states like 
New York, California, and Massachusetts. 
And finally, many of the states with the 
worst murder rates—like Mississippi, Ken-
tucky, Alabama, South Carolina, and Arkan-
sas—are ones that few would describe as 
urban. Only 2 of America’s top 100 cities in 
population are located in these high murder 
rate states. And not a single one of the top 
10 murder states registers in the top 15 for 
population density. 
Whether one does or does not blame Repub-
lican leaders for high murder rates, it seems 
that Republican officeholders do a better job 
of blaming Democrats for lethal crime than 
actually reducing lethal crime. 
If you’re tuned in to the media, you’d 
think murder is rocketing skyward in New 
York, California, Illinois. But those states 
don’t even crack the top ten. 
In fact, the top per capita murder rate 
states in 2020 were mostly those far from 
massive urban centers and Democratic may-
ors and governors. Eight of the top ten worst 
murder rate states voted for Trump in 2020. 
None of those eight has supported a Demo-
crat for president since 1996. 
The chart below shows the top 10 murder 
rate states in 2020. Mississippi had the high-
est homicide rate at 20.50 murders per 100,000 
residents, followed by Louisiana at 15.79, 
Kentucky at 14.32, Alabama at 14.2, and Mis-
souri at 14. The national average was 6.5 per 
100,000 residents, but the top five states had 
rates more than twice that high. 
These red states are not generating ‘‘mur-
der is out of control’’ national headlines. 
They seem to generate no headlines at all. 
The rest of the top ten were filled out by 
South Carolina, New Mexico, Georgia, Ar-
kansas, and Tennessee—all states rarely 
talked about in breathless media reports 
about rampant crime in Democratic strong-
holds. Notably, New Mexico and Georgia 
were the only Biden-voting states in the top 
ten, and they ranked seventh and eighth, re-
spectively. 
Five of the largest Biden-voting states by 
population, and those often in the news when 
it comes to crime, had much lower murder 
rates. New York at 4.11 per 100,000 residents, 
California at 5.59, and New Jersey at 3.70 
were each well below the national average. 
Pennsylvania (7.22) and Illinois (9.20) were 
higher than the national average. But Mis-
sissippi’s murder rate was nearly 400% high-
er than New York’s, more than 250% higher 
than California’s, and about 120% higher 
than Illinois’s. In fact, the five states with 
the highest murder rates, all Trump-voting 
states, had rates at least 240% higher than 
New York’s murder rate and at least 150% 
higher than California’s, the homes to some 
of the largest cities featured prominently in 
the ‘‘crime is out of control’’ narrative. 
Beyond the top 10, we looked at the 2020 
murder rates in the 25 states that voted for 
Donald Trump and compared it with the 
murder rates in the 25 states that voted for 
Joe Biden. The 8.20 murders per 100,000 resi-
dents rate in Trump states was 40% higher 
than the 5.78 murders per 100,000 residents in 
Biden states. These Biden-voting states in-
clude the ‘‘crime-is-out-of-control’’ cities of 
Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, De-
troit, Philadelphia, Portland, Baltimore, and 
Minneapolis, among other large cities. 
Among the 50 states, murder rates were 
often well above the national average in 
many Republican-controlled states and cit-
ies. Jacksonville with 176 homicides and a 
murder rate (19.776) more than three times 
that of New York City (5.94) has a Repub-
lican mayor. Tulsa (19.64) and Oklahoma 
City (11.16) have Republican mayors in a Re-
publican state and have murder rates that 
dwarf that of Los Angeles (6.74). Lexington’s 
Republican mayor saw record homicides in 
2020 and 2021, with a murder rate (10.61) near-
ly twice that of New York City. Bakersfield 
(11.91) and Fresno (14.09) each have Repub-
lican mayors and murder rates far higher 
than either San Francisco or Los Angeles. 
Of course, some cities controlled by Demo-
crats have alarming murder rates, like Chi-
cago (28.49) and Houston (17.32). But we hear 
about these and other Democrat-run cities 
all the time. We aren’t getting the whole pic-
ture. 
In 2020, murder rates increased nearly ev-
erywhere. 
But 
they 
increased 
more 
in 
Trump-voting 
states 
than 
Biden-voting 
states, albeit slightly. The average increase 
in murder rate across all Trump-voting 
states was 32.2% compared to 30.8% in Biden- 
voting states. 
Three out of the five states with the high-
est murder rates in 2020—Mississippi, Mis-
souri, and Alabama—didn’t have reliable 2019 
data available, so they weren’t included in 
this analysis. 
Three of the five states with the largest in-
crease in murder rate were Trump-voting 
Wyoming at 91.7%, South Dakota at 69%, and 
Nebraska at 59.1%. These states are decid-
edly rural and do not conform to the chaos- 
in-the-city meme that has overtaken the 
crime debate. Biden-voting Wisconsin came 
in at the number three spot at 63.2% and 
Minnesota came in fifth at 58.1%. Out of the 
top 
ten 
states, 
six 
were 
Trump-voting 
states—with the additional three being Ken-
tucky, West Virginia, and Kansas. The re-
maining states in the top ten were Delaware 
and Washington. Only one of the top ten 
states in murder rate increases, Delaware, 
was among the top twenty in population den-
sity. 
Again, California, New York, and Illinois 
aren’t in the top ten. California’s murder 
rate increase was 31.1%, or about the na-
tional average. Both New York (45.8%) and 
Illinois (38.2%) were above the national aver-
age. 
The current narrative around crime and 
murder is convenient and wrong. Whether 
you’re watching CNN or Fox News, or get-
ting news online or from a traditional news-
paper, you would think that the increase in 
murder is a phenomenon found mostly in lib-
eral cities. Many have tried attributing this 
increase to Democratic policies, specifically 
police reform. Republican lawmakers and ad 
makers have contributed to this narrative 
through clever messaging and strategies. 
But the data clearly paint a different 
story. The increase in murders is not a lib-
eral cities problem but a national problem. 
Murder rates are actually higher in Repub-
lican, Trump-voting states that haven’t even 
flirted with ideas like defund the police. 
Eight of the ten most lawless, high-murder 
states are not only Trump-voting states, but 
GOP bastions for the last quarter of a cen-
tury. A more accurate conclusion from the 
data is that Republicans do a far better job 
blaming others for high murder rates than 
actually reducing high murder rates. 
We sought 2019 and 2020 murder data from 
all 50 states. Our primary source was the an-
nual crime reports released by state govern-
ments, more specifically from their Depart-
ments of Justice or Public Safety. We chose 
state data because we found it’s more com-
prehensive than FBI data which is often 
compiled later. For example, ‘‘the FBI esti-
mated crime statistics for Mississippi are 
based on data received from 113 of 251 law en-
forcement agencies in the state that year.’’ 
37 states had crime reports for the years 2019 
and 2020: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Cali-
fornia, 
Colorado, 
Connecticut, 
Delaware, 
Florida, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Ken-
tucky, 
Massachusetts, 
Maine, 
Michigan, 
Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jer-
sey, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsyl-
vania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, 
Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. For 
the remaining states we pulled data from 
published 
public 
sources:

Data and sources are attached above. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
assault weapons ban to reclaim our 
streets, churches, schools, and syna-
gogues. 
Assault weapons are killing machines 
and the weapon of choice for mass mur-
derers. In my own county, in Parkland, 
a lone teenager slaughtered 17 people 
by himself all because he had an as-
sault weapon. This deranged individual 
tragically, brutally killed and then 
overturned the lives of those families 
and forever changed our entire commu-
nity. 
But this is no isolated case. Similar 
mass murders haunt Las Vegas, El 
Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde, Orlando, Pitts-
burgh, and too many other commu-
nities for me to list here today. 
No parent should fear seeing a child 
off to a mall, movie theater, or school 
knowing that a killer wielding a weap-
on designed to kill as many people as 
possible and as fast as possible may lie 
in wait for them. 
We need a whole-of-government solu-
tion to this health epidemic, including 
enforced 
ammunition 
background 
checks. 
Let’s take these killing machines off 
our streets and end this fear that one 
person with one assault weapon in one 
moment can tragically tear countless 
lives apart. 
Republicans take note: the Supreme 
Court clearly allows limitations on 
weapons in their decisions. Repeating a 
falsehood doesn’t make it true. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
There is a motion to recommit that I 
would like to offer. If we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
House Committee on the Judiciary to 
consider the amendment to H.R. 1808 
which excludes Active Duty and retired 
military from the ban on assault weap-
ons. 
I, therefore, ask unanimous consent 
to include the text of the amendment 
in the RECORD immediately prior to the 
vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, just 
imagine a 17-year-old makes a decision 
to enlist in the Army, the Marine 
Corps, or the Navy. And then that 17- 
year-old goes through 8 weeks of basic 
combat training at one of the basic 
training centers in Fort Jackson or 
Fort Knox or Fort Benning. Then they 
are given a service weapon, an M16 
typically, and then they are taught to 
assemble and disassemble that weapon 
down to the bolt. 
They will go through training with a 
drill sergeant on a range and they are 
taught how to fire their service weapon 
in live-fire exercises. Then the 17-year- 
old will go on to AIT to be taught their 
specialty and continue to be on Active 
Duty or the Reserves or in the National 
Guard and then potentially deployed. 
What this bill seeks to do is prevent 
this member of the military who comes 
home, either to the Reserve unit or Na-
tional Guard unit or on Active Duty, 
from purchasing a rifle that they can 
use on their own. 
My colleagues who support the bill 
are saying: We trusted you to join the 
service. We encouraged you to join the 
service. But then when it comes down 
to it, we really don’t trust you to go 
out and purchase that weapon. 
It makes no sense. 
If the majority is going to snub every 
veteran in this country by saying: We 
don’t trust you. Then how can the U.S. 
Government ask someone to enlist 
when they don’t trust them to have the 
same responsibility with their own per-
sonal weapon? 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to consider my 
amendment to H.R. 1808 to ensure that 
the Nation’s Active Duty members and 
veterans will be trusted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Wisconsin an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, it is 
so amazing to me that the majority re-
jected this in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. They talk a good game when it 
comes to veterans, but when it comes 
right down to it, they don’t trust them. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise in emphatic support of H.R. 1808, 
the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. 
Over the past few weeks, survivors of 
the horrific shooting in Highland Park, 
Illinois, came to D.C. determined to 
make change. They teamed up with 
Uvalde, Parkland, and Newtown to de-
mand an assault weapons ban to reduce 
the chance of other communities expe-
riencing the trauma they all tragically 
bear. 
Today, thanks in no small part to 
their efforts, the American people will 
get that recorded vote. The world is 
watching. No other nation experiences 
the grotesque number of murders from 
deranged individuals turning weapons 
of war on kids in school, families at 
prayer, and people watching a parade. 
The vote we are taking today will 
show the families of those murdered 
exactly who is on their side—who is 
protecting our children and putting 
people over politics, and, conversely, 
who is on the other side voting for 
their own power. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker PELOSI 
and Congressman CICILLINE for working 
tirelessly to secure a timely vote, and 
I urge passage of this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to H.R. 1808, which is just the lat-
est gun-grabbing bill Democrats are 
dangerously ramming through in their 
unconstitutional crusade to disarm 
America. 
The ink is barely dry on the anti-gun 
bill from last month, and here they are 
pushing another anti-gun bill that pro-
claims to make us safer but does the 
exact opposite. It puts citizens at 
greater risk by taking away the rights 
of the law-abiding. 
This legislation takes aim at our 
Constitution by banning what the 
Democrats call assault weapons, which 
is a vague political term used as a 
catchphrase to make the public think 
we are banning guns that assault peo-
ple. But the truth is that the bill would 
ban the most popular semiautomatic 
rifle in America, the AR–15 and what 
the industry calls a modern sporting 
rifle. 
The Democrats have consistently 
called them weapons of war and are 
trying to ban them from being pur-
chased by law-abiding citizens. 
But whom does this bill exempt? 
The Federal Government. Federal 
Government agencies like the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, 
the Department of Education, the De-
partment of Labor, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
down the line. 
So if they are weapons of war, as the 
Democrats call them, what do these de-
partments need with weapons of war? 
Is the Department of 
Education 
going to use them against the moms 
and dads who protest against woke 
local school board policies? 
Is the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development going to use them 
against the occupants in their housing 
developments? 
You cannot have it both ways. If it is 
a weapon of war, then ban these Fed-
eral agencies, too. 
The truth is they are simply semi-
automatic rifles the Democrats want 
to demonize so they can ban more guns 
and 
take 
more 
of 
our 
citizens’ 
unalienable constitutional rights away. 
Democrat ignorance and malice do 
not justify banning nearly 25 million 
firearms that Americans, including 
myself, proudly own and responsibly 
use.

both the prefatory clause and the su-
premacy clause of the Second Amend-
ment. But it is quite clear: ‘‘A well reg-
ulated Militia, being necessary to the 
security of a free State, the right of 
the people to keep and bear arms shall 
not be infringed.’’ 
Shall not be infringed, period, is the 
supremacy clause. And banning an en-
tire class of firearms, the most popular 
firearm in common use today, is clear-
ly infringement. 
An armed America is a safe and free 
America. I urge all of my colleagues to 
stand firm in the fight to protect and 
preserve the Second Amendment by 
voting ‘‘no’’ on this unconstitutional 
and, therefore, illegal piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter of endorsement 
of the assault weapons ban from the 
Major Cities Chiefs Association, a pro-
fessional organization of law enforce-

MAJOR CITIES CHIEFS ASSOCIATION, 
July 20, 2022. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House 
of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JIM JORDAN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
NADLER
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER JORDAN: I write on behalf of the 
Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), a 
professional organization of law enforcement 
executives representing the largest cities in 
the United States and Canada. Thank you 
for including H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons 
Ban of 2022, in today’s markup. The MCCA 
was proud to endorse this legislation when it 
was introduced earlier this Congress. 
The MCCA has long advocated for sensible 
firearms and gun safety policies. In 2018, the 
Association adopted a Firearms Violence 
Policy that consists of several common- 
sense reforms, including banning assault 
weapons and high-capacity magazines. Many 
law enforcement officials have closely stud-
ied assault weapons and firearms with high- 
capacity magazines and determined they 
have no reasonable sporting or hunting pur-
pose. 
Assault weapons and high-capacity maga-
zines also represent a significant threat to 
law enforcement officers responding to vio-
lent crimes. For example, the suspect who 
murdered NYPD Officers Jason Rivera and 
Wilbert Mora in January 2022 used a firearm 
with a high-capacity magazine that allowed 
his gun to hold 40 additional rounds. Earlier 
this month, Detroit PD Officer Loren Mi-
chael Courts was killed by a suspect with an 
AK–47-style pistol that would have been 
banned under H.R. 1808. 
The MCCA encourages all Members of the 
Committee to support the Assault Weapons 
Ban of 2022 and report it favorably during to-
day’s markup. 
Sincerely, 
JERI WILLIAMS, 
Chief, Phoenix Police Department, 
President, Major Cities Chiefs Association. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a report from the Vio-
lence Policy Center entitled, ‘‘Target: 
Law Enforcement, Assault Weapons in 
the News.’’ 
Section One 
INTRODUCTION: 
BACKGROUND
ON
ASSAULT 
WEAPONS AND FEDERAL ATTEMPTS AT THEIR 
REGULATION 
Assault weapons. Semiautomatic assault 
weapons are civilian versions of automatic 
military assault rifles like the AK–47 and the 
M–16. The civilian guns look the same as 
their military brethren because they are 
identical functionally, except for one fea-
ture: military assault rifles are machine 
guns. A machine gun fires continuously as 
long as its trigger is held back—until it runs 
out of ammunition. Civilian assault rifles, in 
contrast, are semi-automatic weapons. The 
trigger of a semiautomatic weapon must be 
pulled back separately for each round fired. 
Because federal law has banned the sale of 
new machine guns to civilians since 1986 and 
heavily regulates sales to civilians of older 
model machine guns, there is virtually no ci-
vilian market for military assault weapons. 
Nonetheless, civilian semiautomatic assault 
weapons have proven every bit as deadly as 
their military counterparts. 
Regulation of assault weapons. The regula-
tion of semiautomatic assault weapons has 
been a contentious subject for more than two 
decades. 
In the 1980s foreign manufacturers (prin-
cipally China) began dumping semiauto-
matic versions of the Soviet-designed AK–47 
military assault rifle—a ubiquitous staple of 
the world-wide small arms trade—onto the 
U.S. civilian firearms market. Colt Indus-
tries, a domestic manufacturer, was also 
marketing 
the 
AR–15, 
a 
semiautomatic 
version of its M–16 machine gun, the stand-
ard U.S. military infantry rifle. The gun in-
dustry 
introduced 
these 
semiautomatic 
versions of military assault weapons in order 
to create and exploit new civilian markets. 
More particularly, the industry found in as-
sault weapons a product to compensate for a 
slump in handgun sales. Importers and man-
ufacturers rushed copycats and new models 
to market. By the end of the decade, a roster 
of semiautomatic assault weapons had be-
come household words, boosted into daily 
language as much by their glamorization in 
entertainment media as by their deadly toll 
on America’s streets. These guns included, 
among others, assault pistols like the MAC– 
10, MAC–11, and TEC–9, the Ruger Mini–14 
rifle, and several versions of the Israeli Mili-
tary Industries UZI. 
No comprehensive statistics were available 
about the misuse of the hundreds of thou-
sands of assault weapons pouring onto the 
Nation’s streets. But by 1988 police depart-
ments and other law enforcement agencies 
were often on the receiving end of assault 
weapons firepower. Many of them demanded 
that the federal government take action to 
stringently control or ban semiautomatic as-
sault weapons. In February 1988, for example, 
Prince George’s County (Maryland) Police 
Chief Michael J. Flaherty stated, ‘‘The real 
issue is the safety of our officers.’’ Holding 
up a TEC–9 assault pistol, he added, ‘‘It’s not 
used for hunting, and it’s not used for sport-
ing events. In my opinion, they should not be 
sold in the United States.’’ 
In 1989 the federal government took a mod-
est regulatory step. At the urging of William 
J. Bennett, the director of the Office of Na-
tional Drug Control Policy under President 
George H. W. Bush, the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) barred the im-
port of a handful of specific models, includ-
ing AK-type and UZI assault rifles. The move 
was based on a federal statute that effec-
tively limits the import of firearms to those 
that are ‘‘generally recognized as particu-
larly suitable for or readily adaptable to 
sporting purposes.’’ This ‘‘sporting purposes’’ 
test does not apply to domestically manufac-
tured firearms, however. Law enforcement 
officials quickly complained that the puta-
tive ban did not reach many of the most dan-
gerous weapons they faced, including semi-
automatic assault pistols made in the United 
States (e.g., the MAC–10, MAC–11, and TEC– 
9, among others). Although the Bush Admin-
istration claimed to have been conducting a 
wide review with the goal of further regula-
tion, strong opposition by the National Rifle 
Association (NRA) and the firearms industry 
squelched any further regulatory moves by 
the Administration. Within a year, Bennett 
announced himself opposed to any further 
regulation, declaring his opposition at a Feb-
ruary 1990 Senate hearing, stating, ‘‘I don’t 
know a damn thing about guns!’’ 
In 1994, President William J. Clinton 
signed the 1994 federal assault weapons 
‘‘ban.’’ The law defined assault weapons in 
two different ways—by a list of specific fire-
arm types, and by a generic description. 
Thus, the law specifically named 19 types of 
guns (e.g., ‘‘Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Tech-
nologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs’’) as assault 
weapons covered by the putative ‘‘ban.’’ It 
also generally defined as assault weapons 
semiautomatic firearms that could accept a 
detachable magazine and had any two of a 
list of specified design characteristics (e.g., 
bayonet mount, folding stock). The 1994 law 
was deeply flawed. At the outset it exempted 
millions of semiautomatic assault weapons 
by ‘‘grandfathering’’ all such firearms le-
gally owned as of the date of enactment. For 
these guns, it was as if the law had never 
been passed. They continued to be bought 
and sold, many at gun shows where no ques-
tions are asked of prospective buyers in 
nominally ‘‘private’’ sales. Moreover, some 
of the design characteristics by which new 
production or imports were to be defined as 
banned assault weapons were simply a laun-
dry list of superficial cosmetic features that 
had nothing to do with the weapons’ most 
deadly functional features. The gun industry 
quickly and easily evaded the 1994 law by 
making slight, cosmetic changes to the sup-
posedly banned firearms. Gun manufacturers 
and importers soon openly boasted of the 
ease with which they could circumvent the 
ban. By the time the 1994 law expired (sun-
set) in 2004, there were actually many more 
types and models of assault weapons legally 
on the civilian market than before the law 
was passed. 
In April 1998 the Clinton Administration 
attempted 
to 
staunch 
the 
flow 
of 
cosmetically 
redesigned 
foreign 
assault 
weapons by strictly interpreting the ‘‘sport-
ing purposes’’ test for imports. The action— 
taken independent of the 1994 law and in-
tended to close the cosmetic redesign loop-
hole for imports—was reported to have 
blocked 58 types of assault weapons, includ-
ing in one swoop importation permits pend-
ing at the time for as many as 1.6 million 
guns. Since this administrative determina-
tion and action has never been rescinded, it 
should have survived the expiration of the 
broader 1994 assault weapons ban. However, 
there is substantial evidence—including ex-
tensive 
gun 
industry 
advertising—which 
compels the conclusion that the George W. 
Bush Administration either ignored or effec-
tively gutted through administrative artifice 
the 1998 Clinton import controls. This evi-
dence includes the following facts. 
There are numerous companies that appear 
to be importing AK–47 and other assault 
weapons of the type clearly prohibited by the 
import ban. The Russian American Armory 
Company offers the Saiga rifle, an AK–47 
variant that was one of the guns specifically 
excluded from import under the 1998 Clinton 
rule. The Fabrique Nationale Herstal PS90 
assault rifle, a favorite of Mexican drug car-
tels, is manufactured in Belgium and im-
ported by the company’s U.S. subsidiary, FN

USA, according to the company’s catalogs 
and promotional materials. 
There seems to have been a substantial in-
crease in the past few years of assault weap-
ons made primarily from imported parts that 
skirt the import ban by incorporating a 
small, minimum number of US-made parts 
into imported assault weapons (27 C.F.R. 
§ 478.39 prohibits the assembly of a semiauto-
matic rifle or any shotgun using more than 
10 enumerated parts that are imported if the 
assembled firearm is prohibited from impor-
tation under 18 USC 925(d)(3)). 
ATF has further weakened the prohibition 
on imported assault weapons by placing cer-
tain extremely problematic assault rifles on 
the ‘‘curios or relics’’ list. Inclusion on the 
‘‘curios or relics’’ list makes a shotgun or 
rifle automatically eligible for importation 
(18 USC § 925(e)(1)). The most problematic of 
these are certain SKS assault rifles manufac-
tured in Yugoslavia and Albania. The SKS 
type assault rifle is the ‘‘rifle most com-
monly encountered by law enforcement’’ ac-
cording to ATF and is frequently used to kill 
police officers. The Clinton Administration 
specifically banned SKSs from China and 
Russia from import through trade agree-
ments because they are so frequently in-
volved in crime. 
There are examples of firearms being im-
ported that seem to clearly fall outside of 
the ‘‘sporting purposes’’ test articulated in 
925(d)(3). For example, J&G Sales advertises 
‘‘Romanian AK Pistol[s]’’ along with Roma-
nian and Hungarian AK–47 assault rifles. 
For all practical purposes, it thus appears 
that the federal government has abandoned 
all attempts to regulate commerce in assault 
weapons into and within the United States. 
As a result, an unknown but certainly sub-
stantial number of foreign assault weapons 
poured into the United States during the 
Bush Administration and continue to under 
the Obama Administration. This is in addi-
tion to the enormous number of firearms ex-
empted from, or manufactured in easy eva-
sion of, the 1994 law. The only meaningful at-
tempts at regulating this flood of killing ma-
chines exist at the state level. One out-
standing example is California’s assault 
weapons ban, which has been hammered into 
an effective ban after the now-predictable 
gun industry attempts to evade the intent of 
the original law. Even California’s law, how-
ever, is undermined by the lack of a strong 
and effective federal ban, allowing for out-of- 
state assault weapons to be illegally traf-
ficked into the state. 
The current study. This study is a snap-
shot of the effect of America’s laissez-faire 
policy toward assault weapons. Based on re-
ports of assault weapons in the news over a 
two-year span, it makes clear that assault 
weapons are frequently used in crime and 
confiscated from criminals. Moreover, it 
demonstrates that the number of incidents 
in which law enforcement officers are re-
ported to have been confronted with assault 
weapons rose dramatically in the two-year 
period monitored. 
Section Two 
SOURCES FOR THIS ANALYSIS 
The dearth of data. Firearms enjoy the du-
bious distinction of being the only consumer 
product not subject to federal public health 
and safety regulation. Moreover, there is no 
national database tracking deaths and inju-
ries from specific types and models of fire-
arms. And only the most rudimentary, sum-
mary information is collected at any level 
about criminal use of firearms. As a result, 
public policy analysts, legislators, and pub-
lic health and safety administrators must 
make do with crude data and anecdotal anal-
ysis. This is neither an accident nor a prod-
uct of inattention. It is the deliberate result 
of a coldly calculated long-term policy of 
strangling information about guns and their 
public health effects designed by the Na-
tional Rifle Association and its major client, 
the gun industry, and implemented by an all- 
too-pliant Congress. The firearms industry 
and gun lobby know that if as much data 
were available to the public about death and 
injury resulting from firearms as is available 
about, for example tires, toys, or Tacoma 
pick-up trucks, the gun lobby would lose the 
public debate. 
The Tiahrt Amendment. A blatant and cru-
cial example of this iron curtain surrounding 
information about the carnage and crimi-
nality caused by firearms is a federal spend-
ing 
prohibition 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Tiahrt 
Amendment.’’ 
For the past six fiscal years (2004 through 
2010), legislation making appropriations for 
ATF has contained language severely re-
stricting release of information about guns 
traced to crime scenes contained in the agen-
cy’s Firearms Tracing System database. This 
restriction has become known as the ‘‘Tiahrt 
Amendment,’’ after its principal sponsor, 
Representative Todd Tiahrt of Kansas. 
For many years, crime gun tracing data 
was publicly available under the provisions 
of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It 
was an imperfect but extraordinarily useful 
surrogate for a badly needed, but non-
existent, national firearms and public health 
database and tracking system. Crime gun 
tracing data was routinely used by city offi-
cials and law enforcement agencies to deter-
mine the sources of illegally trafficked fire-
arms and to identify corrupt gun dealers and 
the types of guns most often traced to crime. 
The ‘‘Tiahrt Amendment’’ cut off even this 
basic data. It prohibits ATF from releasing 
any data contained in the database, except 
in a limited fashion to individual law en-
forcement agencies. There is also a prohibi-
tion on use of the data in civil litigation. 
Proponents of the ‘‘Tiahrt’’ restrictions 
claim that the release of tracing data could 
interfere with ongoing law enforcement in-
vestigations. However, prior to implementa-
tion of the ‘‘Tiahrt Amendment’’ exemptions 
to the FOIA enabled ATF to withhold any in-
formation that could interfere with law en-
forcement investigations. The FOIA explic-
itly protects from disclosure any informa-
tion that would interfere with enforcement 
or reveal confidential information. More-
over, ATF compilations of tracing data (e.g., 
top 10 crime guns) bore no conceivable rela-
tion to the compromise of any investigation. 
The ‘‘Tiahrt Amendment’’ simply represents 
an unwarranted and cynical restriction on 
public access to information, enacted in the 
interest of protecting the gun industry and 
acquiesced to by a Congress frightened by 
the NRA. 
The ‘‘Tiahrt Amendment’’ also serves to 
hide the source of assault weapons used in 
crime—including 
those 
detailed 
in 
this 
study. For example, it is impossible to docu-
ment the sources of the assault weapons used 
in California, where the sale of such weapons 
is banned, although experience suggests that 
these weapons are illegally trafficked from 
states with lax gun laws such as Nevada and 
Arizona. 
Surrogate data sources. In the absence of a 
responsible national firearms information 
policy, researchers, public policy analysts, 
and policymakers have sought out informa-
tion in various interstices of public life, such 
as public polling and media reports. While 
none claim that these surrogate sources of 
data are comprehensive or ‘‘scientific,’’ they 
represent the best information available in 
the stark aridity of data about guns and 
their effect on public health and safety in 
the United States. 
The current report. This report was devel-
oped in response to a number of stories in 
the news media, as well as Violence Policy 
Center staff conversations with law enforce-
ment personnel, from which it appeared that: 
(1) assault weapons continue to be the source 
of many deaths and injuries throughout the 
United States; and, (2) law enforcement 
agencies have become concerned enough 
about the frequency of their encounters with 
assault weapons that many are issuing as-
sault rifles to their patrol units as a way of 
‘‘evening up’’ the firepower. In short, as has 
so often been seen in the past three decades, 
the gun industry first increased the level of 
firepower available to criminals by mar-
keting enhanced lethality, and then per-
suaded the law enforcement community that 
it needed to ‘‘arm up’’ in order to keep pace 
with the criminals. 
The information described in the following 
pages is based on a compilation derived from 
multiple searches using a variety of terms 
(‘‘assault weapons’’ and ‘‘assault rifles,’’ for 
example) of reports published in U.S. news 
media and included in the commercial data-
base Nexis between March 1, 2005 and Feb-
ruary 28, 2007. Stories that recounted fire-
arm-related events outside of those date 
ranges were discarded. For example, if a 
story within the date range reported an ap-
pellate decision or trial of a shooting that 
occurred prior to the date range, that story 
was eliminated. 
No claim is made that the information 
compiled here is exhaustive, much less com-
plete. It is a fair conclusion from common 
experience and examination of police records 
that many more crimes of violence occur 
than are reported in the news media on any 
given day. Recognizing this, the numbers 
cited in this study most likely represent the 
floor, not the ceiling, of assault weapon inci-
dents, and are best suited to determining 
overall 
trends, 
not 
whole 
numbers 
or 
rankings. Inspection of the stories them-
selves indicates that in the vast preponder-
ance of cases they are based on law enforce-
ment reports. Accordingly, the use of terms 
such as assault weapon or assault rifle in 
these cases is usually derived from police de-
scriptions. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
MR. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, no technology advances more 
quickly in our society than the tech-
nology of killing. Every day, weapons 
of mass destruction are being made and 
manipulated to kill more people more 
quickly. 
In Buffalo, New York, May 14, one 
shooter, a racist shooter, went into a 
supermarket on Jefferson Avenue and 
shot 13 people, killing 10 of them. The 
shooting started and was completed in 
2 minutes and 3 seconds; one shooter. 
I often heard it said that the best 
way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a 
good guy with a gun. There was a good 
guy with a gun in the store that day 
that was working security; a retired 30- 
year-veteran of the Buffalo Police De-
partment. But he was helpless because 
he was outgunned by the bad guy with 
the gun who had an assault rifle. 
I thank Mr. CICILLINE for his leader-
ship on this issue, for his thoughtful 
approach to this, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CHU).

Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, we are the 
only country in the world where mass 
shootings continually happen. They 
happen in schools, grocery stores, 
malls, hospitals, parades, you name it. 
In America, there has not been a single 
week in 2022 without a mass shooting. 
Weapons of war, especially, have no 
place in our streets or schools or our 
grocery stores. They have no place in 
nail salons or churches or shopping 
malls. 
About their horrific impact on chil-
dren like this, a trauma surgeon said 
the tissue destruction is almost un-
imaginable. Bones are exploded. Soft 
tissue is absolutely destroyed. It is like 
a bomb went off. 
But we in Congress can end this. We 
can end this uniquely American plague 
of mass death caused by gun violence. 
I support the assault weapons ban be-
cause we cannot wait to act until the 
next mass shooting. We must pass this 
bill today. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker. I rise to announce that I 
will vote for this legislation, and I will 
do so because I know that there are 19 
babies who were murdered at Robb Ele-
mentary School in Texas who will 
never have the right to vote. 
I rise to vote for it because there are 
two teachers who were murdered who 
will never have the opportunity to seek 
the future that was theirs. 
I rise because we have a Governor in 
the State of Texas who could have 
saved all of those lives if he had but 
only, after the shooting at Walmart 
that took 23 lives, passed legislation 
such as what we are passing today. 
I rise because I don’t want the blood 
of the next person murdered with an 
AR–15-type weapon on my hands. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
heard a lot of talk today about the 
Constitution. Well, when the Founding 
Fathers wrote the Second Amendment 
these kind of weapons didn’t even 
exist. They had muskets and flintlock 
pistols that could fire three or four 
shots in a minute, on a good day; and 
they weren’t very accurate at all. 
The Founding Fathers did not know 
or anticipate these weapons of mass de-
struction that shooters use to kill as 
many innocent people as brutally and 
quickly as possible; and that is exactly 
what they did in my district on Octo-
ber 1, 2017, when you had 60 people shot 
at a concert. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side to have the courage to stand up to 
the NRA and support this legislation. 
It is common sense; it is necessary; and 
it will prevent mass shootings and save 
lives. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), the Chairman of the Appro-
priations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, 26 souls, 
including 20 babies massacred at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School. 
Parkland, Buffalo, Uvalde; the com-
mon denominator, an AR–15-style as-
sault weapon, the weapon of choice. 
Eight of the 10 deadliest mass shoot-
ings involved an assault weapon. We 
cannot be numb to this needless vio-
lence. It is long past time for us to act. 
In Connecticut, the tragedy at Sandy 
Hook changed our lives forever. These 
are unspeakable tragedies. They are 
avoidable tragedies; and they are hap-
pening in our schools, our grocery 
stores, our places of worship. 
The legislation before us today will 
reduce the prevalence of assault weap-
ons, ban the purchase of assault weap-
ons, get them off of our streets, make 
our communities safer, protect our 
children, save their lives. 
Is that not the noblest of goals, to 
save lives? We have the opportunity to 
do that in this body today. Enough is 
enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. MASSIE), the chair of the 
Second Amendment Caucus. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, if facts 
are the ammunition of debate, I point 
out that the other side of the aisle en-
tered this room unarmed. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
mischaracterizations or misfires, if you 
will, about this bill and what this bill 
does that I don’t know where to start. 
But let me start here with the words 
of the author of this bill. He says it 
will ban weapons of war only suitable 
for soldiers in combat. 
Is that what it does? Does it ban an 
M16? It doesn’t ban an M16 or an M4. It 
bans the most commonly sold rifle in 
the United States today and for the 
last several years. 
It doesn’t ban weapons of war. It ex-
plicitly exempts the M1 Garand. Gen-
eral Patton said the M1 Garand is the 
finest implement of battle ever de-
vised. Why is it exempted? It is a weap-
on of war. 
It exempts the M1 Carbine. Look at 
the picture of the soldiers, the marines 
at Iwo Jima. What were they carrying? 
The M1 Carbine. 
It exempts the quintessential Cold 
War weapon, the pride of the Chinese 
and the Communists, the SKS. It is ex-
empted in this bill. These are literal 
weapons of war that are not in this 
bill. 
Now, they will come back and ban 
those, but they don’t want to ban them 
right now because they don’t look 
scary enough. They have a wooden 
forestock and a wooden butt. They not 
made of plastic. They don’t look like 
the scary stuff on the news, so they 
have no interest in banning that. 
Literal, actual weapons of war are 
not banned, but the most common fire-
arm sold today is banned. 
But let’s take them at their word. 
Weapons of war. These are weapons of 
war. We have got to ban weapons of 
war. 
Well, they exempt 80-some Federal 
agencies from the ban. Literally, every 
bureaucratic agency in the government 
can have a weapon of war under this 
bill; weapons of war as they call them. 
So we offered an amendment in the 
committee. We couldn’t conceive of 
why the Department of Education 
would need a weapon of war to com-
plete their mission of educating our 
children; coming up with the cur-
riculum. 
We couldn’t conceive of why the 
USDA would need weapons of war, so 
we offered an amendment to exempt 
the USDA and the Department of Edu-
cation from being able to have these 
weapons of war; so-called weapons of 
war. 
Every Democrat, even though they 
couldn’t give us a good reason of why 
these agencies would need weapons of 
war, or with whom they planned to go 
to war—are they bringing them to the 
school board? Where are they going to 
bring these things? 
Now, they couldn’t give a good rea-
son why these agencies would need 
weapons of war. But they all voted to 
allow these agencies to have weapons 
of war. 
Now, the reason they did, we came to 
that conclusion is, they aren’t weapons 
of war. It is the most common firearm 
sold in the United States today. These 
are not weapons of war. 
There was one Democrat who did ar-
ticulate a reason. He said, well, they 
are actually good for defense. You have 
might need them to defend the Depart-
ment of Education. Well, that is what 
the Second Amendment is about. 
It is not about making sure that the 
Department of Education—which, by 
the way, is unconstitutional—but it is 
not making sure that the Department 
of Education could have proper defense; 
it is for the people to have proper de-
fense. So that is the first falsehood. 
Now, here is another reason that gun 
owners should be concerned about this 
bill. Maybe you don’t own one of these 
firearms, but if you own guns, you 
know about terminal ballistics. You 
know what are suitable calibers for 
hunting deer, for hunting coyotes. 
We have heard it said here today, and 
in the committee, and they showed us 
a video, oh, the terminal ballistics of a 
.223 round are so dangerous that we 
need to ban these AR–15s because they 
shoot .223 rounds. 
What they didn’t show you was a 
video of a deer cartridge, like a .30–06, 
or a 7-millimeter, or a .308. 
If you are banning—if the purpose of 
this legislation is to ban these firearms 
because they shoot a cartridge with

those terminal ballistics of a .223, then 
you plan, you absolutely plan to come 
after deer rifles because they have two 
and three times as much power; two 
and three times as much destructive 
and killing power as the firearm—as 
the cartridge used in the firearm that 
you seek to ban here today. 
Another falsehood. This bill will save 
lives. Let me get to this. We heard it 
here today. I was waiting for it. It was 
mentioned a couple of times. Even the 
Speaker of the House mentioned it. 
They have said that the 1994–2004 as-
sault weapons ban—so-called assault 
weapons—reduced crime; that crime 
went down. Well, guess what? From 
1995–2004, there were 2 million of these 
firearms imported or manufactured and 
sold. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky. 
Mr. MASSIE. The number of these ri-
fles doubled in the United States dur-
ing your last assault weapons ban. If 
you think crime went down because of 
the last assault weapons ban, then you 
have got some explaining to do because 
the number of those rifles increased. 
Maybe, just maybe people became 
safer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this 
bill. 
b 1700 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
We face two choices today in this 
body. One is to protect our children, to 
protect our houses of worship, to pro-
tect where we shop, to protect where 
we watch a movie from guns that exist 
for one purpose only—mass death in-
flicted efficiently. 
Or we can listen to the other argu-
ment, which you have heard, in thrall 
to the gun manufacturers, to protect 
them at any cost, and you as a citizen 
are collateral damage at the altar of 
the gun manufacturers, and we will be 
bathed in blood forever. 
It is time to act. It is time to end the 
madness and disenthrall ourselves from 
automatic weapons that are mass kill-
ers. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding time. 
This is, of course, an emotional de-
bate. Some have talked about fear, and 
they instill fear in the process. As Mr. 
NADLER has pointed out, no weapons 
are taken away. 
A number of Members on the other 
side of the aisle have gotten up and 
said this is an unconstitutional bill. 
Yet, from 1994 to 2004, that bill was 
tested in the courts. None of those 
courts found that unconstitutional. 
In the Heller case, which has been 
quoted over and over again, a very sim-
ple statement was made by that super-
liberal Antonin Scalia. He said, ‘‘Like 
most rights, the right secured by the 
Second Amendment is not unlimited.’’ 
From Blackstone through the 19th 
century 
cases, 
commentators 
and 
courts routinely explained that the 
right was not a right to keep and carry 
any weapon whatsoever in any manner 
whatsoever for whatever purposes. 
One indication of that, of course, is 
that we have a ban on machine guns in 
America. 
Now, 
one 
could 
answer, 
‘‘Well, they are not in common use.’’ 
That is correct, because they are 
banned. 
Mr. Speaker, 67 percent of Americans 
support an assault weapon ban. Fifty- 
three percent, over half, strongly sup-
port, and another 14 percent somewhat 
support, for a total of 67 percent. That 
is in a poll by Morning Consult on May 
25, 2022. 
There was another poll by Pew in 
September 2021 that said that 63 per-
cent of Americans support it. 
In both polls, over 60 percent of 
Americans, over two-thirds of Ameri-
cans, think this action makes sense. 
I am sure the Founders, as they were 
discussing the Second Amendment, de-
bated whether we ought to have mass 
rapid-fire weapons covered by the Sec-
ond Amendment. 
They had no idea. Such weapons cer-
tainly didn’t exist, and they acted 
within the framework of the times in 
which they lived. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress must take ac-
tion today to protect all Americans 
from dangerous and deadly assault 
weapons. If we do so, we will still be 
the country that has the most weapons 
per capita in the world, more weapons 
than people, which you would seem to 
think, therefore, we ought to be the 
least dangerous nation if the premise 
that the more people who are armed, 
the less crime we will have. That seems 
a little counterintuitive to me. 
The weapons that we are talking 
about are able to kill large numbers 
rapidly, used to kill 6 adults and 20 
children at Sandy Hook, used to kill 61 
people in Las Vegas, used to kill 19 stu-
dents and 2 teachers in Uvalde, Texas, 
just a few weeks ago. From Aurora to 
Orlando, San Bernardino, Buffalo, El 
Paso, and Highland Park, they have 
been mentioned today, and we ought to 
mention them on a regular basis to re-
mind us. 
We have watched assault weapons in-
flict mass destruction in our commu-
nities time and time again. Not only do 
these weapons claim the lives of inno-
cent civilians, but they frequently kill 
members of law enforcement who have 
worked to keep their communities 
safe. 
That is why law enforcement largely, 
not all of them, support this bill be-
cause they see that as one of the great-
est dangers to their lives. 
Indeed, one study by the Violence 
Policy Center found that nearly a quar-
ter of all the police officers killed in 
the line of duty between 2016 and 2017 
were killed by the same firearms that 
would be outlawed under this ban. 
Of those police officers killed by as-
sault weapons, almost a quarter of 
them were wearing body armor that 
was nevertheless penetrated by a bul-
let. These types of attacks and police 
killings are not inevitable. 
We know there is a better way. We 
know that because these attacks be-
came far less common when an over-
whelmingly bipartisan coalition—this 
was not some Democratic bill. It was a 
bipartisan bill. I will speak more to 
that in just a second. 
They came together in 1994 to pass a 
ban, including 46 House Republicans. 
That measure had support from law en-
forcement and from both Democratic 
and Republican Presidents, including 
Ronald Reagan. 
After Republicans were in control of 
Congress, they allowed that ban to ex-
pire in 2004. Mass shootings tripled. 
Today, I am pleased to bring Mr. 
CICILLINE’s bill to the floor to rein-
state—reinstate—a bill that has been 
taken to court already. This legislation 
would prohibit the possession, manu-
facture, sale, and transfer of semiauto-
matic assault weapons and high-capac-
ity magazines. It does not take any of 
those away from any citizen. 
To be clear, we are not undermining 
the Second Amendment. I am for a per-
son having the right to have a weapon 
not only to hunt but in his home, in his 
business, to protect himself and his 
family, and, where authorized, to carry 
upon his person—where authorized. 
This bill will not lead to confiscation 
of firearms, notwithstanding the fear 
that has been expressed, of weapons 
that were legally purchased before its 
enactment. However, it will set safety 
requirements. 
Doesn’t that make sense? We have 
safety 
requirements 
for 
our 
cars. 
Doesn’t it make sense to have safety 
requirements for weapons that can 
kill? 
Additionally, this legislation will 
provide funding for buyback programs 
for those who would prefer to be re-
sponsible neighbors and community 
members and relinquish their assault 
weapons voluntarily. 
But, of course, our NRA friends have 
this slippery slope concept that any-
thing we do, even banning cop killer 
bullets, goes too far because of the next 
step and the next step and the next 
step. 
These 
commonsense 
reforms 
will 
save the lives of law enforcement offi-
cers and innocent Americans across the 
country. The Speaker said that we are 
going to bring additional community 
safety legislation to the floor to sup-
port our police because as much as the 
Republicans would like to say we 
Democrats are for defunding the police, 
it is absolutely incorrect and false, and 
they know it.

Why do they know it? Because we 
bring appropriation bills to this floor 
which fund the police, not only at the 
national level but at the State and 
local level as well, which gives lie to 
that assertion. 
Are there some people who used that 
comment? Look in the mirror, folks. 
There are some people on your side of 
the aisle who say absurd things. 
There are many people on both sides 
of the aisle who say, ‘‘Let’s support and 
protect police.’’ This is a way to do it. 
Today, we have an opportunity to put 
votes behind our words and show who is 
ready to do exactly that. 
Now, I hope my Republican friends 
and Democratic friends and my fellow 
Americans will listen to the quote that 
I am about to give from a President 
that used to be revered on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle but is now not 
looked at as such a reverential figure. 
Ronald Reagan said this: ‘‘Listen to 
the American public and to the law en-
forcement community and support a 
ban on the further manufacture of 
these weapons.’’ 
A moment of silence is not enough. I 
should have counted how many mo-
ments of silence we have had on this 
floor this year and lamented the loss of 
children and the elderly and everybody 
in between because of a weapon that is 
designed to kill a lot of people quickly. 
No more moments of silence. Let’s 
act. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Pass this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We haven’t said the Second Amend-
ment was unlimited. We quoted the 
Second 
Amendment, 
the 
Second 
Amendment which the Supreme Court 
has said protects firearms in common 
use. Twenty-four million Americans 
have these weapons. That is most cer-
tainly common use. 
The fact that the chair of the Judici-
ary Committee says, I don’t care, we 
are going to do it even though we know 
it is unconstitutional, that is just 
wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON), my friend. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Too often, Mr. 
Speaker, we skip over the fundamental 
principle and precept and driver of the 
Second Amendment, so let’s reaffirm 
our faith here. 
Our Founders were determined to 
fight against their own government for 
our freedom and independence. They 
stated unequivocally that when there 
was a train of abuses and usurpations, 
and the citizens were reduced to abso-
lute despotism, it was our right and 
our duty to throw off that government. 
We 
wouldn’t 
have 
these 
United 
States, we wouldn’t be here today, 
without this sacred Second Amend-
ment. Every law-abiding citizen in 
America must be able to meet evil with 
equal or greater force, whether it is a 
violent criminal, a crazed killer, or a 
coercive government. 
Mr. Speaker, we must reject this at-
tempt to trample the Constitution, to 
violate the spirit of what those Found-
ers wrote into that sacred document, 
and disarm our citizens. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The previous speaker on the Repub-
lican side said that citizens must be 
able to meet the government with 
equal arms. The United States Govern-
ment has hydrogen bombs. Does he 
think that every citizen ought to have 
a hydrogen bomb? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
b 1715 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I know 
the damage that guns can cause first-
hand. When I was 16, an accidental gun-
shot severed my spinal cord and left me 
paralyzed. 
And yet, the damage caused by that 
gun pales in comparison to the destruc-
tion caused by assault weapons, whose 
sole purpose is to inflict maximum 
damage on their targets. 
No one needs an assault weapon to go 
deer hunting. 
No one needs an assault weapon to 
defend their home. 
These weapons of war simply have no 
place on our streets. 
After all, it is no coincidence that as-
sault weapons were the firearm of 
choice for the killers in Uvalde, Buf-
falo, Pittsburgh, Parkland, Orlando, 
Sandy Hook, and the list goes on. 
I ask my colleagues, does this body 
have the courage to stop the next mas-
sacre from taking place? 
Or will we shirk from our responsibil-
ities and our duty to act, content to 
simply offer thoughts and prayers 
while Americans, and even small chil-
dren, are mowed down in our schools, 
grocery stores, and places of worship? 
I know which side I am on. I hope my 
colleagues will join me. 
I thank Congressman CICILLINE for 
his steadfast work on bringing this leg-
islation to the floor. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the assault 
weapons ban. 
I live very close to Highland Park, Il-
linois, and I have heard from literally 
hundreds of people and met with hun-
dreds of people—students, teachers, 
parents, small businessowners, and, 
yes, even law enforcement officials— 
who demand that we pass an assault 
weapons ban. 
Today’s vote would not be possible 
without the fearless and tireless work 
of advocates and survivors. This day is 
for them. I think that there is no ra-
tional reason that we would allow 
these weapons of mass destruction that 
ravage our families, our communities, 
and even our way of life to be on the 
streets of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote to 
ban assault weapons. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans want their freedom back, and I 
would say to my colleague from Ohio 
(Mr. 
JORDAN), 
your 
freedom 
stops 
where mine and that of my constitu-
ents begin. 
Schools, 
shopping 
malls, 
grocery 
stores, and Independence Day parades 
shouldn’t be scenes of mass carnage 
and bloodshed. Weapons of war have no 
place on the streets of America. 
An experienced Ohio sheriff says it 
well: Assault weapons and large-capac-
ity magazines should only be utilized 
by the military and law enforcement. A 
proposal to ban their use is common 
sense, supported by a majority of 
Americans. Until such time that Mem-
bers of Congress start to care about the 
safety of children in our schools more 
than their next reelection, mass shoot-
ings will continue to occur, and inno-
cent people will die. 
One of the most experienced chiefs of 
police I represent says the following: 
The connection between guns and il-
licit drugs is 100 percent. 
So let’s take the two most important 
steps, remove large-capacity assault 
weapons from our streets and arrest 
the drug dealers who are creating 
death and destruction across our coun-
try. 
Let’s give freedom back to the Amer-
ican people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members to direct 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would just say, if the gentlewoman 
from Ohio wants to come to the Fourth 
District of Ohio and debate me on the 
Second Amendment, I would welcome 
her to come to my district anytime she 
wants to. She can stand here and lec-
ture all she wants, but I would wel-
come her to come to my district. I 
would be happy to debate her. 
My guess is the constituents I get the 
privilege of representing, most of them 
probably agree with me and agree with 
the United States Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this has 
been an interesting debate. 
The cumulative debate from the Re-
publican side has been Members who 
have been wanting to show their inti-
mate knowledge of weapons. It is al-
most a fetishism with weapons, some-
thing that only Freud would properly 
understand and be able to explain to 
the American people. 
They have talked about hands being 
dangerous and knives being dangerous,

but hands and knives and other weap-
ons that they discussed don’t kill peo-
ple in volume and number like AR–15s 
do. 
The CIA did a study and said that 
even shots to extremities all made 
fatal impacts on people. The AR–15 is 
an outgrowth of a military weapon 
that was designed for military use. The 
AR–15 is a weapon that destroys peo-
ple’s bodies and kills them quickly. It 
should not be allowed in a civilized, 
safe society, particularly for children 
and for people in the general public. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time remains on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 2 minutes. 
The gentleman from Ohio has 45 sec-
onds. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, red flag laws take all 
guns from some people. This bill makes 
illegal some guns for all people, and we 
know where they want to go. We know 
what they want to do. They want to 
take all guns from all people because 
they can’t stand the Second Amend-
ment. They hate the Second Amend-
ment. 
In fact, during the markup, the spon-
sor of the legislation said this: ‘‘Spare 
me 
the 
BS 
about 
constitutional 
rights.’’ 
Well, Republicans care about law- 
abiding citizens’ constitutional lib-
erties: Their First Amendment rights, 
their Second Amendment rights, their 
Fourth Amendment due process rights. 
All of those have been attacked by the 
Democrats 
over 
the 
last 
several 
months. 
That is why we should vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this legislation and let law-abiding 
Americans have the respect for the 
Second Amendment they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that as-
sault weapons are the weapon of choice 
for mass shooters and those who target 
law enforcement. They are designed for 
ruthless efficiency, killing the most 
people in the shortest amount of time. 
The gentleman from Ohio is right, I 
did say in the committee, ‘‘Spare us 
the BS.’’ I meant the Republican BS 
about the Constitution, about the Sec-
ond Amendment. 
The Second Amendment is designed 
not to allow people to fight the govern-
ment. 
Do they want to take up arms 
against American troops? Is that what 
they say? 
That is what they say. You saw what 
that did with the insurrection we had 
recently, and that was a mild case. 
No, the Second Amendment is de-
signed to allow for a well-regulated mi-
litia, which is to say in our day the Na-
tional Guard. 
The assault weapons ban would take 
the weapons of war off our streets and 
save countless lives, and that is why it 
is supported by all associations of po-
lice, 
the 
American 
Federation 
of 
Teachers, the American College of 
Physicians, 
the 
American 
Public 
Health Association, the National Alli-
ance to End Sexual Violence, the Na-
tional Organization of Black Law En-
forcement Executives, the Major Cities 
Chiefs Association. They know what 
they are doing. 
The assault weapons ban would take 
these weapons of war off our streets. It 
would prevent more of the Uvaldes, 
more of the Parklands, more of the 
Tree of Life synagogues. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this important legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1302, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Fitzgerald of Wisconsin moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 1808 to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. FITZGERALD is as follows: 
In subsection (v)(4) of section 922 of title 
18, United States Code, as proposed to be in-
serted by section 3(a)(1) of the bill, (1) strike 
‘‘or’’ at the end of subparagraph (D), strike 
the period at the end of subparagraph (E) and 
insert ‘‘; or’’, and add at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(F) the possession, by an individual who 
is a member of the Armed Forces on active 
duty or a veteran.’’. 
In subsection (t)(1) of section 922 of title 18, 
United States Code, as proposed to be in-
serted by 5(a)(4) of the bill, insert ‘‘(other 
than an individual who is a member of the 
Armed Forces on active duty or a veteran)’’ 
before ‘‘to transfer’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 2(b) of rule XIX, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the motion 
to recommit. 
The question is on the motion to re-
commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of Rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of passage. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 207, nays

tions in the engrossment of H.R. 1808, 
to include corrections in section num-
bers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-

may be necessary to reflect the actions 
of the House.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Honorable KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, Republican Leader: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 29, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to 29 USC 
§ 780, I am pleased to appoint the following 
member to the National Council on Dis-
ability: 
Mr. Shawn Kennemer, Bakersfield, Cali-
fornia. 
Thank you for your attention to this mat-
ter. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader.

LOWERING COSTS FOR 
HARDWORKING AMERICANS 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
House Democrats have been fighting to 
lower costs for hardworking American 
families every day. From the gas pump 
to the grocery store checkout lines, we 
have reclaimed our commitment to our 
mission of creating a fair and balanced 
economy where Americans can thrive, 
and our efforts are starting to pay off 
in some areas. 
For example, gas prices continue to 
drop across the Nation, which leaves a 
little more money in the pockets of 
American families, allowing them to 
spend more on necessities like putting 
food on the table. 
We have passed a series of bills to 
lower everyday costs for Americans, in-
cluding the Lower Food and Fuel Costs 
Act and the Consumer Fuel Price 
Gouging Prevention Act. 
However, we need more. 
We must continue to put people over 
politics and pass more comprehensive 
legislation to help Americans thrive.

WHY DO YOU WANT MY GUNS 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, a 
right is not truly a right if it requires 
permission from the ruling class. Mr. 
Speaker, you and others in this body 
seek to strip us of the most sacred 
tenet of natural law. With H.R. 1808, 
this body is attempting to disarm 
Americans by outlawing basic rifles 
and handguns. 
It seems only logical to think that a 
government intent on disarming its 
citizens is planning to do something 
that those same citizens would utilize 
firearms to prevent. 
In response to this radical gun con-
trol bill, I submitted H.R. 8399, effec-
tively known as the double tap to tyr-
anny bill, to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code and repeal the National 
Firearms Act, thus removing infringe-
ments on our Second Amendment. 
H.R. 1808 and the NFA both stem 
from the same class of totalitarianism. 
Our Founders understood that the first 
steps to tyranny begin by removing 
every safeguard that hinders its ap-
proach. 
Mr. Speaker, let me ask you this: 
Why do you want my guns? You seem 
perfectly content sitting behind a 
squadron of armed guards while your 
constituents are slaughtered by gang 
violence in the streets. Perhaps your 
reason for taking away my rights to 
defend myself are not as well-inten-
tioned as you present them to be. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KATELLA HIGH 
SCHOOL 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise 
to 
congratulate 
Katella 
High 
School in my district for winning the 
National Green Ribbon Award. 
Katella High School is one of 36 high 
schools nationwide to win this honor. 
Katella High School has also been rec-
ognized as a California Green Ribbon 
School not once but twice; in 2020 earn-
ing the bronze award, and in 2021 earn-
ing the silver award. 
From a Colonist to the Knights, con-
gratulations. Keep up the good work.

CARDS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, ev-
erybody is obsessed with inflation, as 
well they should be obsessed, but there 
are so many stories out there that the 
mainstream media is not covering that 
the American public ought to be aware 
of. 
Right now, ICE is proposing identi-
fication cards for illegal immigrants. 
First of all, we have a situation in 
which there are over 170,000 people al-
lowed in this country every month who 
should probably not even be here ille-
gally. 
Why is this? 
Already we promised free healthcare, 
and I think in many cases people com-
ing here illegally are getting more 
healthcare 
or 
easier 
access 
to 
healthcare than people are originally. 
They are allowed to travel all around 
the country. 
Now there is already a concern in my 
State that many illegal immigrants 
are getting public benefits, as well. I 
am afraid that these cards will be used 
to further solidify the programs to give 
free public benefits to those people who 
shouldn’t be here. 
I hope the press looks into it.

CONGRATULATING RANDAL S. 
JERNIGAN 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Marine Sergeant Major 
Randal S. Jernigan, the United States 
Marine Corps JROTC from my alma 
mater, Catholic High School for Boys, 
in Little Rock on a very happy and 
healthy retirement. 
Jernigan retired from the Marine 
Corps where he served in a variety of 
roles. Upon his retirement, Jernigan 
returned to his Ohio hometown where 
he began a teaching career. 
Ten years later, Jernigan was hired 
to lead the Catholic High School 
JROTC program. After a short time, 
Jernigan took over the school’s phys-
ical fitness team where during his first 
3 years, Jernigan had delivered three- 
peat national titles. 
This year, Jernigan and his team of 
cadets took home another national 
title, but this time it was different. 
Jernigan and his cadets received the 
2022 National Title on Catholic’s home 
field for the first time. 
In all, Jernigan led nine different 
teams at Catholic High School to na-
tional titles, plus two more teams from 
Mount St. Mary Academy. 
As school begins in a few weeks, we 
will 
miss 
seeing 
Sergeant 
Major 
Jernigan on campus. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Major 
Jernigan for his service and dedication 
for our hardworking students. His im-
pact is recognized and lasting. 
BIDEN RECESSION 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, the United 
States has officially entered a reces-
sion thanks to the out-of-touch eco-
nomic policies of President Biden and 
congressional Democrats. 
Since the day Democrats gained con-
trol of our government, having majori-
ties in the House, Senate, and a Demo-
cratic President in the White House, 
fiscally conservative Members of Con-
gress like myself have been sounding 
the alarms on this reckless deficit 
spending that got us in this mess. 
Now, it looks like it will be Repub-
licans tasked with getting us out of 
this recession, as the American people 
are fed up with Democrats’ economic 
policies that are causing record-break-
ing inflation and now a recession. 
If and when Republicans gain control 
of the House, I can assure you the first 
thing we will do is stop the out-of-con-
trol and wasteful spending enacted 
under a complete Democratic control 
of Washington. Hopefully, by then, the 
President will come to his senses and 
work with Republicans to get us back 
on track. 
f 
ROLE THAT CALIFORNIA PLAYS IN 
CROP PRODUCTION CANNOT BE 
UNDERSTATED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the 
Biden administration is throwing such 
a wrench in the American economy and 
is stifling production in critical domes-
tic industries, including agriculture. 
His failed economic policies raised 
input costs on essentials like fuel and 
fertilizer and severely disrupted our 
supply chain. 
Of great concern right now in Cali-
fornia is our water supply. His regu-
lators in the Bureau of Reclamation 
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife have cut so 
much water out of the State. We have 
hundreds of thousands of acres that are 
idle this year. 
Now, why is that important to every-
body across the country? California 
produces a very high amount of all 
these crops: 100 percent of artichokes, 
celery, garlic, honeydew, olives, plums. 
Many of these crops you can see on this 
chart here: 100 percent, 96 percent, 94 
percent. Even down here, wild rice, 60 
percent. Horseradish, 30 percent. 
The water is being taken away to 
grow these crops. Is that a big deal? 
Well, if you want to import it from 
other countries, I guess you can, and 
then we can be subject to their supply, 
their price, their delivery times. 
California is the top agriculture pro-
ducing State in the country. We need 
to have a water supply. We do not need 
to have it taken away by regulators or 
given to fish or environmental stuff. 
b 2045 
INFORMATION REQUEST TO 
CAPITOL POLICE 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, a law 
today that I was not aware of is 2 USC 
1979, Release of Security Information. 
And section (c) says, ‘‘Nothing in this 
section may be construed to affect the 
ability of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, including any Mem-
ber . . . to obtain information of the 
Capitol Police regarding the operations 
and activities of the Capitol Police 
that affect the Senate and House of 
Representatives.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, they have thousands 
and thousands of hours of video, and I 
have seen what notice was given to one 
of the January 6 defendants. It said, 
You will get this section, this section. 
That is what we will use to prosecute. 
They were not given any of the excul-
patory evidence. 
So today, we requested this informa-
tion—all the video—from the Capitol 
Police, and it is worth fighting for be-
cause we need to know all the truth. 
f 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mr. GRIFFITH (at the request of Mr. 
MCCARTHY) for today on account of a 
natural disaster in the district.

KEITH CARLISLE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Searcy’s Battalion chief, Keith 
Carlisle, on his retirement from the fire serv-
ice. 
For 34 years, Chief Carlisle has worked to 
protect our community. Born and raised in 
Cabot, he went on to the fire academy and 
later returned on down the road to Searcy. 
His greatest moments in service included 
comforting victims of car accidents or fires. 
Every member of the fire service deserves 
admiration for their exemplary work for their 
communities. Public servants, like the chief, 
play a vital role in the infrastructure that keeps 
out citizens safe and healthy. I commend 
Keith Carlisle for his leadership and give best 
wishes as he transitions into retirement.

HOMETOWN HERO—BUFFER 
INSURANCE 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize our Texas–24 Hometown 
Heroes of the week, Sean Turner and Buffer 
Insurance of Southlake, Texas. 
In response to the recent Roe v. Wade deci-
sion, secular companies have offered to pay 
travel costs for employees to abort babies out- 
of-state. Fortunately, companies like Buffer In-
surance have taken an opposite, humane ap-
proach. 
Buffer Insurance in Southlake, Texas has 
offered to pay the medical costs for their em-
ployees who birth babies and provide paid 
time off for employees to have maternity and 
paternity leave. They would also pay medical 
costs associated with adopting a baby. 
Buffer Insurance CEO, Sean Turner has 
served as a leading voice on Buffer’s decision 
and how they are prioritizing families and their 
employees and setting an example of a real 
pro-life company. This veteran-owned North 
Texas business should serve as a guiding 
light to every American. Its dedication to help-
ing mothers and their children is a powerful re-
minder of the sanctity of life, and I am hon-
ored to represent them in Congress. 
I thank Sean Turner and Buffer Insurance, 
for affirming life and valuing children and par-
ents in our community. 
HONORING THE YPSILANTI SENIOR 
CENTER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Ypsilanti Senior Center 
for the 60th anniversary of their founding. 
Their decades of service to the Ypsilanti com-
munity are worthy of commendation. 
Since December of 1962, the Ypsilanti Sen-
ior Center has been providing crucial services 
to the seniors in our community like opportuni-
ties for safe and structured recreation, lunches 
to order, as well as education in technology. 
The Center also provides a place in the com-
munity for friendship, socializing, and net-
working. With all that it provides, the Center 
has truly become a home away from home for 
our seniors. 
Under the leadership of Director Monica 
Prince, the Ypsilanti Senior Center was able to 
continue its important work during the depths 
of the pandemic. They switched over to a fro-
zen meal pickup, maintaining a service that is 
essential to those who cannot provide for 
themselves. Partnering with our Washtenaw 
Community College, fitness classes were 
taken online to make sure that our seniors 
could continue to access them. Despite being 
isolated, our seniors were able to maintain 
that feeling of community that the Senior Cen-
ter provides. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Ypsilanti Senior Center for 
6 decades of exemplary service to the seniors 
in the Ypsilanti community. I extend my grati-
tude to all the workers and volunteers that 
have provided comfort and joy to those who 
laid the foundation for future generations to 
grow and prosper.

RECOGNIZING 
REVEREND 
DR. 
WILLIE 
GABLE, 
JR. 
RETIRING 
PASTOR OF PROGRESSIVE BAP-
TIST CHURCH AFTER 34 YEARS 
OF SERVICE 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding, 
cherished public servant from my home State 
of Louisiana. Dr. Willie Gable, Jr., a native of 
New Orleans, received his Doctor of Ministry 
from United Theological Seminary (Dayton, 
OH), Master of Divinity from Union Baptist 
Theological Seminary (New Orleans, LA), 
Master of Public Administration from the Uni-
versity of Southern California (Los Angeles, 
CA) and Bachelor’s of Science from Ten-
nessee State University (Nashville, TN). 
Committed to a life of ministry and commu-
nity service, Dr. Gable retires as pastor of Pro-
gressive Baptist Church, only its third pastor in 
123 years. He is also the founder and Execu-
tive Director of the Dr. M.W. McCaleb Edu-
cational Fund, Inc., a non-profit organization 
that offers housing through its four facilities, 
rental assistance, and tutoring services to low- 
income individuals and families. 
During the formative years of life as a 
youngster growing up in the Calliope Public 
Housing units, Dr. Gable considered all kinds 
of careers, but initially was not drawn to serve 
God as a preacher. However, he ultimately 
found his true calling as a servant of the Lord, 
and our community is so grateful that he did. 
Dr. Gable worked for years in the Health 
Public Administration field, including as the 
Fiscal Administrator of the Nashville Model 
Cities Program in Nashville, Tennessee. His 
achievements in program development gave 
the opportunity to join Meharry Medical Col-
lege faculty to develop a new undergraduate 
program in Health Administration and Plan-
ning. He coordinated the development and 
construction of Pembroke Area Family Health 
Center and Health Department where he also 
served as CEO. He was recruited to Chicago, 
Illinois as the Administrator of Tabernacle 
Hospital, a 130-bed African American church- 
owned facility. 
Dr. Gable has formerly served on many 
community boards throughout his career. Cur-
rently, he is a member of American Associa-
tion of Homes and Services for the Aging as 
well as the National Baptist Convention Hous-
ing and Economic Development Commission 
as Board Chairman and President, which 
manages 27 housing facilities across 17 
states. Also, he serves on the National Con-
ference for Community and Justice, Legacy 
Foundation, Director Faith Based Initiatives 
HUD National Baptist Convention USA, Inc., 
and Gulf Coast Housing Partnership. He is 3rd 
Vice President of the 1st District Missionary 
Baptist Association and an Instructor with Lou-
isiana Baptist and National Baptist Conven-
tion’s Congresses of Christian Education. 
He has been an inspirational mentor to me, 
and I will truly miss his service to this commu-
nity.

RECOGNIZING THE AMARILLO ECO-
NOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORA-
TION 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight a hard-working group that 
has had tremendous impact on the City of 
Amarillo and those who live there, including 
my family. The Amarillo Economic Develop-

tunities. These programs enable businesses to 
either relocate or stay in Amarillo and provide 
a breeding ground for new and up and coming 
business ventures. AEDC helps to cultivate 
the true economic potential that Amarillo and 
the Panhandle have to offer. 
Starting a business is risky and many peo-
ple do not know where to start. AEDC has 
been there for more than 30 years to help ex-
isting local businesses expand while also help-
ing to attract new businesses to Amarillo. One 
of AEDC’s largest ventures is the Amarillo 
EnterPrize Challenge, which over the last 25 
years has connected AEDC with the WT En-
terprise Center to help over 90 companies de-
velop their business aspirations. 
The impact that AEDC has had on the busi-
nesses and residents of Amarillo cannot be 
understated. On behalf of the entire Amarillo 
community, I want to thank Kevin Carter and 
all AEDC staff for their unwavering commit-
ment to promoting economic growth, and for 
helping our workforce maximize their potential.

HONORING NAACP MONTEREY 
COUNTY BRANCH 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Monterey County Branch of 
the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP) as they celebrate 
90 years of service to the central coast of 
California. Since its inception in 1932, the 
NAACP of Monterey County has fiercely advo-
cated for the expansion of civil rights. It has 
been at the forefront of all struggles and 
movements to defend and extend the political, 
social, and economic rights of all those who 
were the victims of injustice. 
The Monterey County branch was originally 
founded as two separate branches. Both were 
created with the shared goal of raising aware-
ness to racism and racial discrimination in all 
its forms. In 1932, Reverend Wellington Smith, 
Sr., then Pastor of the First Baptist Church of 
Pacific Grove, took a step toward equality by 
founding the Monterey Peninsula branch. 
Seven years later, Mr. William Greenwill 
founded the Salinas Branch with the same 
goal of ridding the county of its most abject 
forms of racism and discrimination. Despite 
enduring long periods of threats to their mem-
bers and families, both branches never fal-
tered in their quest to eliminate race-based 
discrimination 
and 
ensure 
political, 
edu-
cational, and social economic equality. 
Before merging in 2006, each respective 
branch spearheaded decades-long battles in 
fighting against racist police practices, barriers 
to accessible housing, and employment dis-
crimination. Over the years, both branches 
have received numerous national awards for 
their outstanding work in fighting for equality. 
Most recently, in 2012, the Monterey County 
Branch was awarded the Claude Hudson 
Award, which honors a local branch that ex-
emplifies the NAACP standards. That same 
year, Mr. Jim Black, treasurer of the branch, 
was named Treasurer of the Year for his hon-
orable work in the organization. In 2013, the 
Branch was awarded the Ruby McKnight Wil-
liams Award, which recognizes branches with 
the largest percentage increase in member-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize this historic milestone. I personally extend 
my gratitude to the members of the Executive 
Team and the volunteers who have worked 
tirelessly to become one of the most effective 
civil rights organizations in Monterey County 
and the State of California.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIRE-
MENT 
OF 
PASTOR 
EDDIE 
D. 
SMITH, SR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a dedicated man of God, 
dedicated family man, visionary leader, and 
friend of longstanding Pastor Eddie Smith on 
his retirement as the Pastor of Macedonia 
Missionary Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia. 
His retirement will be celebrated at the Mac-
edonia Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia, on 
August 7, 2022, at 3:00 pm. 
Pastor Smith is a native of Macon, Georgia, 
born to the union of the late Pastor Jack 
Smith, Jr., and Mrs. Mattie Mae Myers Smith. 
A highly educated man, Pastor Smith attended 
Bibb County public schools and went on to 
earn a Bachelor and a Master of Science from 
Fort Valley State College, now Fort Valley 
State University. On April 26, 1969, Pastor 
Smith received a calling that would change his 
life forever—he was called to preach the Gos-
pel of Jesus Christ. Pastor Smith served as a 
classroom teacher and a media specialist in 
the Bibb County Public School system for 
fourteen years before retiring to serve full-time 
at Macedonia Church, accepting the role of 
pastor in 1972. While pastoring, he was also 
called to public service, serving as a Macon 
City Councilman from 1975 through 1978, as 
well as a member of the Bibb County Board 
of Education for two consecutive terms. 
The scripture reminds us in Proverbs 29 
that ‘‘where there is no vision, the people per-
ish.’’ Pastor Smith’s vision for Macedonia was 
evident from the very beginning of his ministry. 
In his early years at Macedonia, Pastor Smith 
led the congregation in raising the funds to 
pay off the church’s fifteen-year mortgage in a 
record five years. In 1999, Pastor Smith led 
Macedonia Baptist in the purchasing of a 
struggling sister church. Together, they relo-
cated and revived the church’s congregation, 
and liquidated its $1.35 million debt in under 
three years. In more recent years, he oversaw 
the funding and construction of the $1.7 mil-
lion dollar Family Life Center, a comprehen-
sive faith-based service ministry that educates 
clergy across middle Georgia. Over the course 
of his ministry, Pastor Smith has licensed and 
ordained more than forty-five ministers, ex-
tending the reach of his servant leadership to 
the members of many congregations through-
out the region. 
Also, he led his flock through the COVID–19 
pandemic, establishing community-wide food 
distribution services and virtual church serv-
ices and tithing, while ensuring all bills were 
paid and no church staff lost their jobs. 
Shirley Chisholm once said that ‘‘Service is 
the rent that we pay for the space that we oc-
cupy here on this earth.’’ Pastor Smith has 
paid his rent and he has paid well. Pastor 
Smith’s service has extended beyond the 
walls of the church, as he has been affiliated 
with several social and civic organizations 
throughout his career. He has served on the 
boards of the United Way, the American Can-
cer Society, the Macon Ministerial Association, 
and the Macon Police and Firefighter Discipli-
nary Hearing Board. 
Pastor Eddie Smith has always fought for 
what is right. He is guided by his love of God 
and his love of people. Mother Teresa once 
said that ‘‘at the end of life we will not be 
judged by how many diplomas we have re-
ceived, how much money we have made, how 
many great things we have done. We will be 
judged by ‘‘I was hungry, and you gave me 
something to eat, I was naked, and you 
clothed me. I was homeless and you took me 
in.’’ This is how Pastor Eddie Smith has lived 
his life and served people in the name of 
Jesus Christ. 
At the center of Pastor Smith’s accom-
plished life is the unwavering love and support 
of his family and his loving wife, Martha Kate. 
Pastor Smith is the father of five adult chil-
dren: Suwandia; Eddie, Jr.; Corey and the late 
Alvy Smith and Edwanna Smith Stephens. He 
is the grandfather of fourteen and great-grand-
father of three. 
On a personal note, Pastor Smith has been 
my friend for many years. He has never told 
me what I wanted to hear, but he has always 
told me what he felt I needed to hear. I will be 
forever grateful for his wise advice and sage 
counsel. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian; and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 people of the Second Congres-
sional District, The Macedonia Missionary 
Baptist Church family and entire Macon com-
munity, in extending our sincerest appreciation 
and best wishes to Pastor Eddie D. Smith, Sr. 
upon the occasion of his retirement as Pastor 
of Macedonia Baptist Church and his many 
years of humble service to humanity.

RONALD 
G. 
SARG (USAF, RET.) 
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER 
OF DELAWARE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Col. Ron Sarg, a Vietnam veteran, a tireless 
advocate for Delaware’s Veterans, and a 
friend. 
Col. Sarg served combat duty in Vietnam 
and pursued a career in the Air Force. After 
his time in Vietnam and throughout his career, 
he was posted from Turkey to New Mexico. 
Eventually, he was stationed in Dover, Dela-
ware, where he retired from active duty in 
1993. 
But Col. Sarg continued to serve his country 
and community in retirement. He helped Dela-
wareans gain rewarding careers as an instruc-
tor at Polytech Adult Education in Dover and 
he trained many students in the field of den-
tistry at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Yet, he never forgot his fellow veterans. He 
spent his retirement serving those who heard

the call to duty in our Nation’s military. He was 
a member of the Military Officers Association 
of America and served as Chairman of the 
Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs, a 
significant leadership role for Veterans in the 
State of Delaware. In these roles, Col. Sarg 
pushed for national and state-level policies 
that helped Veterans and active-duty service 
members access affordable housing, receive 
high-quality mental health care, and gain op-
portunities for a good education and career. 
To Col. Sarg’s family, please accept my 
heartfelt and sincerest condolences. Ron was 
a true friend and a pillar of our community in 
the First State. He will be greatly missed but 
not forgotten.

MOURNING DR. JIM CITTY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
mourn the loss of Dr. Jim Citty, a longtime 
physician in Searcy. 
Dr. Citty first moved to Searcy in 1957 to 
play basketball and football for Harding Uni-
versity, where he would later serve as team 
physician for Bison Athletics. 
Upon graduating from herding, Jim attended 
medical school at the University of Tennessee 
and later enlisted in the United States Army 
during the Vietnam War. 
Dr. Citty returned to Searcy to settle down 
in 1975. Throughout his career, Dr. Citty deliv-
ered over 10,000 babies in the White County 
area. 
Known and loved by Searcy residents, 
many of whom he helped deliver, his loss is 
felt deeply. ‘‘Doc’s’’ impact within the commu-
nity will not be forgotten. 
My prayers go out to Dr. Citty’s family, 
friends, and all who knew and loved him.

RECOGNIZING LANA ABBASI FOR 
HER DUTIFUL SERVICE IN CON-
GRESS ON BEHALF OF THE 41ST 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
OF 
CALIFORNIA 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
today to honor Lana Abbasi, a dedicated 
member of my team who has recently an-
nounced her plans to return home to California 
to join the private sector. Since October 2017, 
Lana has loyally served the constituents of the 
41st Congressional District, where she has 
worn many hats as a field representative, 
press secretary, and now communications di-
rector for my office. 
Lana has been an invaluable asset to the 
institution of Congress and my team, and we 
are deeply saddened by her departure. During 
her tenure, Lana has elevated the values of 
my constituents and their needs through influ-
ential media strategies on numerous topics 
that have brought national recognition to the 
Inland Empire. 
Lana’s work to deliver timely information to 
constituents regarding COVID–19 in the face 
of a global pandemic was vitally important to 
the health and well-being of thousands of peo-
ple in the Inland Empire. Her messaging and 
outreach on other issues such as the treat-
ment of our veterans, the future of work, and 
federal investments in local projects were also 
imperative. 
Madam Speaker, I am incredibly honored to 
have had Lana as a member of my team. Her 
contributions to my office and the constituents 
of California’s 41st District will be forever cele-
brated through her service and her work. 
Lana’s quick wit and impeccable fashion 
sense will be missed in the office each day, 
and I wish her all the best in her future en-
deavors.

HONORING RODRIGO ‘‘ROD’’ 
GARCIA 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and celebrate the life of Rod Garcia, a 
respected visionary, leader, and advocate in 
Southern California. Rod dedicated his life to 
empowering the Latino community in edu-
cational excellence, economic opportunity, and 
social equity through the science, technology, 
engineering, and math fields. He was a trail-
blazer for Latinos in STEM, and his work to 
continue diversifying this essential workforce 
lives on. 
Rod graduated from California State Univer-
sity in Los Angeles with a Bachelor’s Degree 
of Science in Engineering. During the tech 
boom in California in 1973, Rod became one 
of the few Hispanic engineers to be a leader 
in the STEM field. 
Seeing the lack of Latino representation in 
STEM, Rod founded the Society of Hispanic 
Professional Engineers (SHPE). He sought to 
diversify the field by offering networking and 
educational opportunities for Hispanic students 
and professionals in the Southern California 
region. 
Rod had the unique ability to unite commu-
nity partners and leaders around the country 
in the commitment to closing the STEM gap 
among Latinos. 
Over the course of five decades, Rod pro-
pelled the Society of Hispanic Professional 
Engineers to reach 13,000 members and 286 
chapters nationwide. 
Today, Latinos continue to experience some 
of the most noticeable disparities in represen-
tation within the STEM field. 
But Rod’s legacy will live on through his de-
votion and work to close that gap. His work 
will continue to help future generations of 
Latinos realize their fullest potential to posi-
tively impact the world.

HARDING ACADEMY BASEBALL 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Gavin Alveti, a 2022 graduate from 
Harding Academy and distinguished member 
of the Wildcat baseball team, who was re-
cently named the Arkansas Democrat Gazette 
All-Arkansas Preps Baseball Player of the 
Year. 
Gavin suffered a broken orbital bone during 
a game in April after being hit by a fastball. 
Despite these injuries, Gavin returned to the 
mound within a week and was able to finish 
out his senior season. 
The Harding Academy baseball team went 
on to win the AAA Arkansas State Champion-
ship, under the leadership of Coach Shane 
Fullerton. 
Despite obstacles throughout the season, I 
am pleased to recognize Gavin, Coach Ful-
lerton, and the Harding Academy baseball 
team on a strong, hard-fought season. 
I congratulate them on their achievements.

HOMETOWN HERO—AVERY HILL 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero of the week, Avery Hill, an avid reader 
and young woman who has gone above and 
beyond to better our community. 
Avery began volunteering with Exodus Min-
istries, a nonprofit designed to transform the 
lives of previously incarcerated mothers and 
their children. While volunteering at the Exo-
dus House—a transitional house for the moth-
ers and their children—she noticed the chil-
dren’s library shelves were bare. Inspired to 
share her passion for reading with underprivi-
leged children, Avery took action. 
During the onset of the COVID pandemic, 
Avery began organizing book drives. She 
spread the word around her community to 
leave any books, games, or elementary school 
supplies on their doorsteps, where she would 
then go door to door to pick them up. 
After organizing all the donations, Avery not 
only stocked the library’s shelves with 600 
new books, but revamped it by adding a 
mural, new curtains, 300 building blocks, and 
50 games. 
Avery’s story should serve as an inspiration 
to all of us to not only give back to our com-
munity but leave it better than when we found 
it. 
I wish Avery the best of luck as she heads 
off to college this fall, and thank her for her 
dedication to helping our fellow North Texans.

Darcy also serves our community as a

manship and look forward to rooting him on as

HONORING ELINA ZILBERBERG 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Elina Zilberberg, a resident 
of Ann Arbor, Michigan, for her 25 years of 
service with the Jewish Family Services of 
Washtenaw County. Her contributions to our 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Born in Baku, Azerbaijan in the former So-
viet Union, Elina immigrated to the Detroit 
area with her parents as a refugee in 1979. 
This experience sparked a deep interest in ref-
ugee advocacy, leading Elina to begin her ca-
reer as a resettlement case worker in Metro 
Detroit after earning a B.A. in Business Ad-
ministration from Wayne State University. In 
the years since, Elina has dedicated her pro-
fessional career to supporting others as they 
navigate the same challenging journey her 
family experienced decades ago. 
From her humble beginnings as JFS’s first 
employee in October 1997, Elina has become 
a pillar of the organization. She now serves as 
their Chief Operating Officer and is involved in 
coordinating employment services, the English 
as a Second Language program, and trans-
portation services. As COO, she oversees HR, 
facilities management, as well as purchasing. 
Her leadership has been instrumental to the 
enormous growth that JFS of Washtenaw 
County has experienced over the last 25 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues today

with our community to thank her for her tire-
less work in helping other families prosper and 
achieve the American Dream. I am proud to 
honor her work and the impact she has made

THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN 
WOMAN 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding, 
cherished public servant from my home State 
of Louisiana. My dear friend and the mayor of 
the City of Ville Platte, Jennifer Vidrine, will 
soon take the top leadership position of the 
Louisiana Municipal Association (LMA) as the 
first African-American woman Board President. 
The LMA was established in 1926 and is the 
strongest advocate for municipal government 
in my state. On July 30, it will become an 
even stronger and more effective organization 
with the installation of Mayor Vidrine as presi-
dent. 
This is one of many ‘‘firsts’’ she is known 
for. In 2011, she was elected the first woman 
and African-American mayor of her fine city 
where today she continues to provide sound 
and caring leadership. Mayor Vidrine is a 
skilled and dedicated municipal leader with a 
deep passion for the residents she serves. On 
any given day, you will find Mayor Vidrine 
meeting with constituents about an array of 
issues affecting the elderly and youth, inspect-
ing city utilities, sharing ideas with business 
leaders, and visiting local schools. Her phone 
never stops ringing. She encourages residents 
to call her directly on her cell phone, and they 
do. She frequently utilizes a telephone mes-
saging service to keep residents informed on 
issues ranging from severe weather warnings, 
boil advisories, local sporting events, and the 
all-important annual celebrations like the city’s 
Smoked Meat and Louisiana Cotton festivals. 
She was one of the first mayors to provide 
free testing and vaccinations during the early 
stages of the COVID–19 pandemic. Working 
with state and federal officials, Mayor Vidrine 
was steadfast in instituting sound local ordi-
nances to keep her community safe and pro-
vided critical personal protection equipment. 
She is an eloquent speaker who knows how to 
educate and motivate those of us in positions 
that can help navigate the federal bureauc-
racy. She never hesitates to speak up on be-
half of the smaller towns and villages of our 
state giving them a voice of care and concern. 
She is an absolute force to be reckoned with 
each time she travels to Capitol Hill as one of 
the LMA’s chief advocates for local govern-
ment issues. 
Madam Speaker, it is a distinct honor for me 
to recognize this great leader and advocate for 
our great State of Louisiana, The Honorable 
Jennifer Vidrine in such a public way. I am 
confident she will have a significant and last-
ing impact on the LMA for years to come. I am 
extremely proud to call her my dear friend and 
now, Madam President.

MILDRED DAVIDSON 100TH

Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ms. Mildred Davidson of Sweet 
Home, Arkansas, in honor of her 100th birth-
day. 
Ms. Mildred Davidson grew up as one of 11 
children and went on to work when she was 
just nine years old, helping her mother with 
her work as a maid, laundress and raising her 
other siblings. Those who know her, and her 
life story will tell you, Ms. Davidson’s dedica-
tion to serving others is clear. 
She worked for 25 years at the Arkansas 
Confederate Home providing care to poverty- 
stricken veterans, their widows and their or-
phans. 
She was later hired into her dream job as 
an employee at the Holiday Inn at Sixth and 
Broadway, where her work spanned nearly 
two decades and included assignments on the 
hotel’s seventh floor, which was reserved for 
special guests. Ms. Davidson was known for 
being an exemplar worker, making certain to 
treat every guest with respect. 
Today, she dedicated her time to being with 
her grandchildren and has plans to grow a 
vegetable garden this summer, just as she 
has done throughout her life. 
I give my best wishes to Ms. Davidson and 
her family in celebration of her 100th birthday, 
and I commend her for her decades spent car-
ing for others.

and recent recipient of France’s highest dis-
tinction, the Ordre national de la legion 
d’honneur, also known as the Legion of 
Honor. 
On July 14, 2022, Mr. Marvel was presented 
the Legion of Honor by the French Ambas-
sador to the United States, Phillipe Etienne. 
The Legion of Honor was first created over 
two centuries ago to reward eminent military 
and civil merits in service or defense of 
France. Created as an order of merit, foreign 
citizens may be awarded this recognition for 
their actions in support of France. For a World 
War Two Veteran like Mr. Marvel to be award-
ed the Legion of Honor, they must prove they 
were involved in combat operations within 
France. 
As a Private First Class with the 45th Infan-
try Division of the United States Army, Mr. 
Marvel’s service demonstrated exceptional 
bravery, character, and valor. Arriving in 
France shortly after the Battle of the Bulge, 
Mr. Marvel was soon given a vital mission to 
clear mines and booby traps. That mission 
brought Mr. Marvel and another soldier into di-
rect contact with enemy troops. For his suc-
cessful actions that day, Mr. Marvel was 
awarded the Bronze Star. After this action, Mr. 
Marvel participated in several dangerous com-
bat missions to help liberate France from Nazi 
Germany, including missions as a bazooka- 
man and in notable amphibious operations 
across the Rhine River. 
Despite the significant combat Mr. Marvel 
and his unit saw in Europe, perhaps the most 
harrowing experience was their actions to lib-
erate the victims in the Dachau Concentration 
Camp. As Mr. Marvel and the 45th Infantry Di-
vision moved toward Dachau, they were en-
gaged in fierce combat with German troops 
still defending the camp. Mr. Marvel would 
help liberate 32,000 captives of Dachau. But, 
as Mr. Marvel recalls, the ‘‘sights in this camp 
I will never ever forget.’’ 
Mr. Marvel was awarded numerous awards 
for his service, including the Bronze Star, the 
Combat Infantry Badge, and several campaign 
medals. With the latest award of the Legion of 
Honor, Mr. Marvel joins a distinguished group 
of Americans, including President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, Audie Murphy, Chuck Yeager, 
and many others. 
On behalf of the State of Delaware and a 
grateful nation, I thank Mr. Marvel for his serv-
ice to our country. He sacrificed greatly to 
safeguard freedom and democracy. He is a 
testament to our Nation and his actions were 
in keeping with the highest traditions of the 
United States Army. Congratulations once 
again to Mr. Marvel on this honor, as he 
brings great pride to Delaware and the United 
States.

HONORING COLONEL ERIC A. KEN-
NEDY 
ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM THE U.S. MILITARY 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Colonel Eric A. Kennedy, upon 
his retirement after more than 30 years of mili-
tary service in both the U.S. Army and U.S. 
Air Force. A dedicated and respected public 
servant, he has continued to serve his fellow 
veterans as the lead physician assistant at the 
Battle Creek VA Medical Center. 
Colonel Kennedy’s passion for medicine and 
innovation helped make 21st Century Cures a 
reality. Through Eric’s work as the lead PA at 
the Battle Creek VA Medical Center, he has 
helped thousands of veterans like himself lead 
healthy lives after their service. He has been 
a preceptor for Grand Valley State University 
and WMU Homer Stryker M.D. School of Med-
icine students during his time at the VA. 
In addition to Eric’s long history of medical 
service, he also served as an active member 
of the Michigan Army National Guard and was 
deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa on 
humanitarian missions. In 2015, Colonel Ken-
nedy was the first physician assistant to be 
named Medical Commander for the Michigan 
Army National Guard. He now serves as the 
State Surgeon for the Michigan Army National 
Guard, where he is responsible for policy di-
rection and management of the Michigan 
Army National Guard health service system. 
In addition to the Colonel’s long list of ac-
complishments, he and his wife, Sarah have 
raised two wonderful daughters, Brielle and 
Brooke, in Mattawan, Michigan. Sarah and 
Eric met at Western Michigan University right 
here in Southwest Michigan many years ago 
and together they have grown as a family and 
helped grow our community with their many 
successes. 
I congratulate Colonel Kennedy. His retire-
ment is well deserved, and I look forward to 
seeing what the future holds for him.

NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS 
ARTIST LEAGUE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding work of the artists 
who make up the North Central Arkansas Art-
ist League. 
The league recently debuted a new art ex-
hibit, currently on display at the Ozark Health 
Medical Center in Clinton through August 
17th. 
The exhibit is made up of 43 original pieces 
of art, created by local artists inspired by 
‘‘Summer Fun’’. Subjects include landscapes, 
florals, wildlife, and portraits. 
All artwork is made from oils, acrylics, wa-
tercolors, and charcoal. 
I commend the North Central Arkansas Art-
ist League on another successful exhibit, and 
I encourage all to spend an evening in Clinton, 
admiring the work of our local artists.

LEGISLATIVE BRANCH 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the CHIPS Act 
will help boost the United States’ semicon-
ductor manufacturing capacity. The legislation 
includes a 25 percent investment tax credit for 
businesses to invest in facilities for which the 
primary purpose is the manufacturing of semi-
conductors or semiconductor manufacturing 
equipment. Experts agree that a semicon-
ductor is a substance, such as silicon, whose 
electrical conductivity is between that of a con-
ductor and that of an insulator, or a semicon-
ductor device. Semiconductors have become 
an essential aspect of modern life, and this 
legislation will increase the production of semi-
conductors here in the USA, including in my 
home state of Michigan. I support passage of 
this crucially important legislation which accel-
erates the production of U.S.-made semi-
conductors by providing support along the en-
tire supply chain.

RARE KIDNEY DISEASE WEEK 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the designation of July 18 to July 
22, 2022, as Rare Kidney Disease Week. 
Too often, rare kidney diseases are life- 
threatening, lack effective treatments, are dif-
ficult to diagnose. Many individuals who are 
diagnosed with a rare kidney disease—par-
ticularly communities of color, which are dis-
proportionately burdened by disease—rapidly 
progress to end-stage kidney disease, kidney 
failure, and the need for a kidney transplant. 
Meanwhile, there has been little to no innova-
tion in treatment for kidney disease patients 
since the 1960s—a time when the use of di-
alysis and immunosuppressants became com-
monplace. 
This lack of innovation makes Rare Kidney 
Disease Week especially crucial for spreading 
awareness. Increased awareness of rare kid-
ney diseases will encourage accurate and 
early diagnosis, help prevent the need for di-
alysis and kidney transplant, and support both 
public and private efforts to develop effective 
diagnostics and cures. 
It is with high expectations that Rare Kidney 
Disease Week is observed nationally for years 
to come, providing hope for and shedding light 
upon the rare kidney disease community. 
Once again, I am pleased to recognize July 
18 through July 22, 2022, as Rare Kidney Dis-
ease Week.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. STEPHAN EARLY 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor the life and legacy of a community 
leader and advocate, Mr. Stephan Early. 
Mr. Early was an educator and active com-
munity member. Mr. Early taught English at 
Eagle Rock High School for 30 years and was 
part of the National Education Association 
where he represented California as a delegate 
in education policy for nearly 10 years. He 
was most proud of teaching Shakespeare to 
students, noting the literature’s timeless and 
engaging language. 
Mr. Early was a standout educator, and 
dedicated ally and advocate. He supported his 
students at bake sales, car washes, and en-
couraged neighbors to do the same. Mr. Early 
would say, ‘‘in order to communicate an idea, 
you need to be able to write it down.’’ His pas-
sion for teaching, creating community, and 
service is what made Mr. Early a model cit-
izen. 
Mr. Early cared so deeply about his commu-
nity that he served as the Eagle Rock Neigh-
borhood Council President for 2 years and al-
ways worked on protecting the Eagle Rock 
community. Mr. Early was a proud family man 
and veteran. His wife, Mrs. Early, remembers 
him as a loving husband and proud father of 
2. Mr. Early served our Nation in uniform dur-
ing the Vietnam War and was awarded the 
Purple Heart. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Stephan Early.

HONORING SAM MILLS 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in commemoration of the life of Sam Mills as 
he is posthumously enshrined into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame on August 6, 2022. 
Despite often being overlooked due to his 
small stature as a linebacker, Sam Mills per-
sisted and shattered misperceptions and 
records throughout his career. He never gave 
up on or off the field, fighting until the end of 
his two-year battle with cancer, which trag-
ically took him too soon at the age of 45. Re-
fusing to let his diagnosis stop him, Mr. Mills’ 
motto to ‘‘Keep Pounding’’ became a rallying 
cry for his team and future generations of 
players. 
Born in Neptune and raised in Long Branch, 
Mr. Mills was a New Jersey native who always 
stayed true to his roots. A standout player for 
Long Branch High School, Mr. Mills was a 
first-team All-Shore selection in his senior 
year. His Long Branch jersey is proudly dis-
played in the high school gymnasium along-
side his Carolina Panthers jersey. Each year, 
two players in the Shore Sports Network All- 
Shore Gridiron Classic are chosen to receive 
the Sam Mills Award in his honor. 
A walk-on at Montclair State, Mr. Mills left 
his mark on the university as he did in Long 
Branch. He set records, was recognized for 
his performance, and led the team as captain 
for two seasons. The university retired his jer-
sey number and memorialized his legacy with 
a residence hall and the dining area, Sam’s 
Place, named after him. In addition to his 
achievements on the field, Sam Mills grad-
uated Montclair State with a Bachelor of 
Science degree and was later awarded an 
honorary doctoral degree from the university. 
He has been inducted into the Montclair State 
University Hall of Fame as well as the College 
Football Hall of Fame. 
Overcoming rejections by other leagues, 
Sam Mills played three seasons in the United 
States Football League (USFL), where his tal-
ent did not go unnoticed. When his USFL 
Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars coach Jim Mora 
was named head coach of the New Orleans 
Saints, he took Mr. Mills with him. Mr. Mills’ 
athletic prowess and leadership helped the 
Saints to four playoff appearances in his 9 
seasons with the team. He was then a key 
player with the 1995 expansion team Carolina 
Panthers, where he played until his retirement 
in 1997. At the end of his NFL playing career, 
Sam Mills recorded 12 seasons and 181 
games, 5 Pro Bowl appearances, 3 All-Pro 
and All-NFC selections, and remarkable ca-
reer statistics. 
After retiring as a player, Mr. Mills found his 
way back to the field in 1999, working as an 
assistant coach for the Carolina Panthers. 
Having nearly entered the teaching profession 
before joining the USFL, Mr. Mills was a nat-
ural as a coach. He continued to coach 
throughout his cancer treatments, inspiring the 
franchise to this day. ‘‘Keep Pounding’’ is in-
scribed in the collar of each team jersey, the 
Keep Pounding Drum is played before each 
home game, and a statue depicting Mr. Mills 
was erected outside their stadium. Likewise, 
both his Panthers and Saints jerseys are re-
tired. 
Mr. Mills is remembered by his loving family, 
who will be in Canton, Ohio for the Pro Foot-
ball Hall of Fame celebration, as well as 
former teammates, players, and coaches. His 
induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame 
ensures that future players and individuals 
alike will be inspired by his story. His char-
acter and tenacity are as much a part of his 
legacy as his statistics and accomplishments, 
and his impact on those he has mentored di-
rectly, and indirectly, is indelible. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my 
colleagues will join me in honoring the life and 
accomplishments of Sam Mills. His election to 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2022 
is well-earned and truly deserving of this 
body’s recognition. Keep Pounding. 
BURLENE SHEPARD AND JOHN 
FISHER 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate Burlene Shepard and John Fisher 
who were married June 9. 
At The Crossing at Riverside Health and 
Rehab in Searcy, Burlene was 65 and never 
married and John Fisher, at 66, moved into a 
nearby room. It didn’t take long for the two to 
find themselves talking for hours and soon 
after, falling in love. 
While unexpected, their relationship lit up 
the center and brought together residents and 
staff members as they created a beautiful 
ceremony. 
Surrounded by friends and family, the cou-
ple celebrated their love as they had their 
wedding in the very lobby where they got to 
know one another. 
Best wishes to them both.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF PETER 
J. DALEY II 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life of Pennsylvania State 
Representative Peter J. Daley II, who sadly 
passed away last month. 
Representative Daley dedicated his life to 
the people of the Keystone State. He began 
his career as a schoolteacher before becom-
ing mayor of California Borough at the age of 
twenty-two, the youngest mayor in the history 
of the Commonwealth. Representative Daley 
taught and led the borough for seven years 
before being elected to the Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives in 1982. 
During his 34 years in the Pennsylvania 
House, Representative Daley served as Chair-
man of both the Agriculture and Rural Com-
mittee and the Commerce Committee. Rep-
resentative Daley’s legislative achievements 
included enabling farms to co-exist with resi-
dential areas and reforming mortgages during 
the 2008 financial crash. His leadership also 
led to the creation of thousands of jobs in 
Pennsylvania. 
Beyond his civil service, Representative 
Daley worked as an attorney after earning a 
degree from the Widener School of Law. He 
was widely known as a friendly and knowl-
edgeable lawyer, affectionately earning the 
nickname 
‘‘Uncle 
Pete’’ 
from 
many 
he 
mentored. 
Representative Daley was an active mem-
ber of his community. Every Easter and 
Thanksgiving, he helped organize and sponsor 
food distribution events. He will be greatly 
missed for this generous spirit. Peter is sur-
vived by Sally, his wife of 47 years, 3 children, 
and 5 great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life of Representative Peter J. Daley 
II. May we be inspired by his dedicated serv-
ice to the Commonwealth.

ICE TO OHIO’S FIFTH CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a dedicated member of my staff, 
Drew Griffin, who will be leaving our office at 
the beginning of September. 
Hailing originally from the Pacific Northwest, 
Drew has dedicated his career to public serv-
ice, including time spent working on behalf of 
the people of Washington and Minnesota. We 
have been blessed to have Drew working on 
behalf of the Buckeye state for the past six 
years, three of which as my Chief of Staff, and 
we know it will be hard to replace him. 
A dedicated sports fan, Drew could always 
be counted on to discuss the latest news im-
pacting his Seattle Sounders or Washington 
Nationals. 
He 
instilled 
in 
everyone 
he 
interacted with a sense of comradery and pur-
pose, showcasing the positive impact that indi-
viduals can have on their community if they 
worked together. 
Drew is also a loving father to daughter, 
Eve, and son, Jack, and a dedicated husband 
to Ann. As he enters this next chapter in his 
life, I know that he will have the love and sup-
port of his family and friends to help him along 
the way. 
I am eternally grateful for Drew for all he 
has done for me, and I wish him and his fam-
ily the best.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MSG MICHAEL CLARK 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the premature, tragic loss of 
an American patriot, devoted husband and 
parent, Master Sergeant Michael Clark of 
Bolton, Connecticut, age 41. MSG Clark trag-
ically lost his life on July 20, 2022, from a 
lightning strike while on army reserve training 
exercises with his unit at Fort Gordon, Geor-
gia. 
Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Michael 
was brought up in a family with a deep sense 
of duty to our nation. Like his father David 
Clark, Michael 22 years ago volunteered to 
wear the uniform of his country in the U.S. 
Army. During that time, he deployed on four 
occasions to Iraq and Afghanistan. As a strik-
ing example of the Clark family’s devotion to 
military service, he and his father were simul-
taneously deployed overseas on two occa-
sions. MSG Clark was an operating room spe-
cialist with the U.S. Army Reserves, assisting 
with lifesaving, emergency surgeries in dan-
gerous environments. Madam Speaker, some-
times the essential role of our military’s Re-
serve Force is not that well understood or ap-
preciated. MSG Clark’s life and public service 
is a powerful reminder of how critical all of our 
reserve forces are in providing key support for 
active-duty soldiers, sailors, marines and coast 
guard as part of the mission to defend our na-
tion and our way of life. 
At home, David applied his skills to another 
center of excellence, the Bone and Joint Insti-
tute at Hartford Hospital, facilitating high qual-
ity orthopedic and healing care to the Con-
necticut community at large. His work in that 
cutting-edge hospital system, enhanced the 
skills he applied to the work he performed in 
the Army Reserve. His double faceted work in 
the civilian and military sector highlights that 
he was the quintessential ‘‘citizen soldier’’ 
which forms the backbone of our guard and 
reserve system. 
A family man at heart, Michael’s passing is 
heartbreaking for his wife, Rachel, and two 
children, Logan and Hailey. He was very in-
volved in his children’s sports and active in the 
town of Bolton, which has been mourning his 
loss since the news of his passing was made 
public. The Bolton Fire Department imme-
diately displayed a prominent memorial to 
MSG Clark at its fire station which as another 
volunteer force is fitting. Though he never left 
for deployment without leaving a love letter at 
Rachel’s bedside, he still kept involved with 
his family, and made sure to prioritize his chil-
dren’s upbringing. The void left behind him 
has already exerted a strong influence upon 
the relatively young Clark family and children 
especially, and we can only find solace in 
coming to cherish—with time—the lessons 
and positive force that he spread during his 
short time on this earth. Carrying those memo-
ries onward is paramount as we simulta-
neously appreciate the unmatched level of 
dedication he purposed towards nurturing his 
family. 
Madam Speaker, MSG Clark’s legacy of 
commitment toward those around him remains 
infinite. He was a doer and as part of the ‘‘car-
ing profession’’, a highly talented healer. We 
bear the standard of his memory not just to 
honor his service to his family and our Nation, 
but also to put him forth as an example of how 
every one of us to carry our own lives, trying 
help and heal others. To that end, Madam 
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
this moment to honor the name and character 
of MSG Michael Clark, so that we may pre-
serve for austerity his life’s story.

BIG CAT PUBLIC SAFETY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 263, the ‘‘Big Cat Public Safe-
ty Act’’ which would prohibit the private pos-
session, breeding, and public exploitation of 
lions, tigers, leopards, and other large cats. 
H.R. 263 amends the animal rights protec-
tions outlined in the ‘‘Lacey Act’’ and the 
‘‘Captive Wildlife Safety Act’’ by prohibiting the 
import and shipment of big cats in the U.S., 
preventing public contact with big cats outside 
of academic and research institutions, and 
halting the illegal breeding of cubs by private 
owners. 
I have long been an advocate for protecting 
big cats. 
In the 114th Congress, I proudly sponsored 
the ‘‘Cecil the Lion Endangered and Threat-
ened Species Act of 2015’’ which prohibited 
the importation of any endangered animal 
killed via trophy hunting, including African 
lions, amur leopards, and other big cat spe-
cies. 
Today I will continue to fight for the 
wellbeing of these animals by urging Congress 
to pass this equally important piece of legisla-
tion—H.R. 263. 
It is estimated that there are anywhere be-
tween 10,000 and 20,000 big cats living in pri-
vate captivity within the U.S. 
In fact, the Humane Society has been 
quoted saying that there are more tigers in 
captivity in Texas alone, than there are in the 
wild in the entire world; 
These noble animals often live in terrible 
conditions and are at risk of abuse and ne-
glect at the hands of inexperienced and un-
trained handlers. 
Many big cats are used as side show attrac-
tions for private roadside zoos that mas-
querade as rescue sanctuaries. 
Under the guise of wildlife conservation, pri-
vate animal collectors manipulate the public 
into paying money and offering donations for 
the upkeep of their big cats. While private 
owners profit off the animals, the living condi-
tions of the lions, tigers, leopards, and other 
animals rarely improve. 
Under H.R. 263, private owners would be 
allowed to retain their current animals—with 
restriction. 
This legislation would mandate that all pri-
vately owned big cats be registered to ensure 
that first responders and animal control offi-
cers are aware of the presence of big cats 
within their communities. 
This allows police to be prepared in the 
event of an animal attack or escape. 
In 2021 a 175-pound tiger was famously 
caught on film stalking an off-duty police offi-
cer in Houston. Videos show the officer aiming

a pistol at the tiger as the animal continued to 
prowl closer. 
It took law enforcement officials more than 
a week to track down and arrest the wild ani-
mal’s owner. Had this animal been registered 
to the city, the owner would have been identi-
fied and the situation would have been more 
rapidly resolved. 
Fortunately, in that instance neither city resi-
dents nor the tiger were harmed. However, 
that is not always the case with captive big 
cats. 
Since 1990, more than 400 dangerous inci-
dents involving big cats have occurred across 
the country. 
Four children and 16 adults have lost their 
lives. Hundreds more have been mauled or 
mutilated. 
Big cats cannot be domesticated. 
They are not pets whose ancestors have 
lived alongside humans for thousands of 
years. 
They are not for human amusement. 
Regardless of how much human contact 
these animals experience, big cats will always 
maintain their natural instinct to hunt and at-
tack. 
They are, and always will be, wild animals. 
While large menageries of adult tigers and 
leopards attract tourists to private zoos, baby 
cats are the most lucrative resource for private 
animal collectors. 
Unregulated zoos receive the majority of 
their income through the despicable practice 
of ‘‘cub-petting.’’ 
Cub petting requires that baby lions, tigers, 
and other cats be ripped from their mothers 
just hours after birth so that they can be han-
dled and photographed by paying tourists. 
Because visitors want to see the smallest 
and youngest cubs, zoos only put cubs on dis-
play until they are about 8 to 12 weeks old. 
At that point, the cubs become financial and 
safety liabilities. 
Once they are too big to be used for cub 
petting some are killed, distributed on the 
black market for animal parts, or sold for pets. 
The ‘‘Big Cat Public Safety Act’’ would put 
a stop to this barbaric and inhumane practice 
by prohibiting the accidental and intentional 
breeding of new cubs. 
H.R. 263 would allow big cat breeding only 
by wildlife sanctuaries, veterinarians, univer-
sities, and zoos that have qualified and trained 
staff acting within the best interest of animals 
and ecological conservation. 
The bill would also require that any public 
observation of big cats be at a distance of 15 
feet, thus preventing the continued practice of 
cub-petting and big cat photo ops. 
By implementing these reforms, Congress 
can continue to support the protection of en-
dangered species while preventing the exploi-
tation and abuse of big cats in America. 
I have consistently called for the develop-
ment of pragmatic, environmentally friendly, 
and economically efficient strategies for ad-
dressing and resolving environmental and ani-
mal rights crises. 
This bill is a viable solution to the plight of 
big cats in American captivity. 
The ‘‘Big Cat Public Safety Act’’ is an in-
valuable step towards preventing animal 
abuse and threats to public safety in the 
United States. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I encourage my constituents to steer 
clear of any and all private big cat zoos or col-
lections. There are ways to honor and observe 
these magnificent animals while ensuring they 
receive the respect and care they deserve.

HONORING THE LIFE OF TO VAN 
LAI 
HON. MICHELLE STEEL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the life of one of my constitu-
ents. To Van Lai of Westminster lived a truly 
vibrant life and touched the lives of Viet-
namese communities in Orange County and 
around the world. 
After working as a university professor, To 
Van Lai established Thuy Nga Productions in 
Saigon, bringing the joy of music to the people 
of Vietnam. 
When the communist government there 
banned his work, he took his company to 
France. There, he produced his most well- 
known and beloved work: Paris by Night, a re-
nowned variety show that has brought Viet-
namese entertainment to homes around the 
world. 
Throughout his career, he valued the his-
tory, language, and tradition of the Viet-
namese people. 
He believed deeply that ‘‘If you still have the 
Vietnamese language, then you still haven’t 
lost the people.’’ To Van Lai’s life reminds us 
to treasure and honor the rich heritage and 
culture of our Vietnamese communities. 
My prayers are with his family during this 
difficult time. May his memory of preserving 
the heritage of our Vietnamese neighbors live 
on, and may he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER TONY 
BREEDEN ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the dedicated service of Police of-
ficer Tony Breeden who will officially retire this 
year. 
Tony was born in Winchester, Virginia, 
where he and his family lived for 2 years. His 
family later moved to Charlotte, N.C. where he 
attended Myers Park High School graduating 
in 1988. Upon graduating from High School, 
he joined the U.S. Marine Corps where he 
served from 1988 to 1992. 
After spending four years in the Marine 
Corps, he then joined the Mecklenburg County 
Sheriff’s Department where he worked for 2 
years, until joining the Rock Hill Police Depart-
ment in 1995 through 2022. 
He rose through the ranks beginning with 
the traffic unit, sergeant of the street crimes 
unit, patrol Lieutenant of Charlie Shift, and 
member of the highly decorated SWAT team 
unit for 26 years serving from 1996 to 2022. 
Officer Breeden found time to serve the 
greater Rock Hill community by coaching var-
ious sports for over 27 years at his church and 
in the city leagues, dating back to 1995. 
Tony and his wife, Brooke, have 3 children 
Austin, Kolby, and Devin. Officer Breeden is 
the epitome of the American success story, 
where he has risen above many personal 
challenges, including having his father leave 
his family when Tony was 5 years of age. He 
and his brother and sister were left to be 
raised by a single mother. 
The greatest tragedy the Breeden family 
has faced was the sudden loss of their son 
Kolby on March 14th, 2021. In the words of 
one of Kolby’s closest friends, Julianne Young, 
‘‘Kolby was the epitome of good. He not only 
lit up every room he walked in but made ev-
eryone in that room a better person just by 
spending time with them.’’ 
The Rock Hill Police Department and the 
greater Rock Hill community will lose a true 
public servant who epitomized the police offi-
cer motto of ‘‘To Protect And To Serve’’. 
Lieutenant Tony Breeden has set the Gold 
Standard for 27 years of dedicated service 
and commitment which will long be remem-
bered and for that we all join in saying Thank 
You.

RECOGNIZING THE UPPER PENIN-
SULA LUGE CLUB OF NEGAUNEE, 
MICHIGAN 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the Upper Peninsula Luge 
Club (UPLC) of Negaunee, Michigan for all 
their accomplishments this past year. A non- 
profit organization, UPLC has been serving 
their Yooper community for over forty years 
with the goal of promoting the sport through-
out the region. Through their commitment to 
excellence and inclusivity, UPLC creates a 
fun, safe, and accessible activity during the 
long winter season of the Upper Peninsula. 
Built circa 1990 by Swedish Civil Engineer, 
Per Vinberg, the Lucy Hill Naturbahn Luge 
Track is the only full-length natural luge track 
in the United States. In addition to maintaining 
and operating the track, members of the 
UPLC help introduce Yoopers to the sport and 
provide instruction for new sledders, as well 
as participate in community events like 
Negaunee’s annual Heikki Lunta Winter Fes-
tival. On top of promoting local luging, the UP 
Luge Club supports a national competition 
team that competes all over the world—includ-
ing the FIL Junior World Cup in Latzfons, Italy. 
They also host U.S. athletes that come to the 
course to train before going to World Cup and 
World Championship Competitions in Europe. 
Through more than four decades of dedication 
to the sport and their local community, the 
UPLC has become an indispensable part of 
the Upper Peninsula. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the Upper Peninsula Luge Club for their con-
tributions and service to Michigan. On behalf 
of Michigan’s First District, I wish them all the 
best in their future endeavors.

REMEMBERING THE 2ND ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AUGUST 4, 2020 
BEIRUT PORT EXPLOSION 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, on August 
4, 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate 
stored at the Port of Beirut in the capital city 
of Lebanon exploded, causing more than 220 
deaths, 7,000 injuries, at least $15 billion in 
property damage, and leaving an estimated 
300,000 people homeless. Two years have 
passed and yet there is no closure for the 
families of the victims, and many are left be-
hind to bear the burden of rebuilding their lives 
and their communities. 
The United States Congress, the Adminis-
tration, the Lebanese-American community, 
and many others worldwide responded with 
significant food, and humanitarian assistance, 
medical equipment, and reconstruction sup-
plies. Today the need has only magnified 
given the continued obstruction by corruption 
and political instability—preventing an open ju-
dicial investigation. 
The Lebanese diaspora community, the 
families of the victims, and the international 
donors urge the Lebanese government to en-
force the calls from the United Nations, the 
International Support Group, and the American 
government, to move swiftly and effectively to 
complete the investigation and bring those 
guilty to justice. Lebanon needs a free, inde-
pendent, and legitimate judicial system and 
government. Committing to conclude the in-
vestigation will serve as a major step in free-
ing the courts from the political entanglements 
and pressures that have for too long impeded 
justice and fairness in Lebanese society. 
As the co-chair of the U.S.-Lebanon Friend-
ship Caucus, which allows members of Con-
gress to learn and engage on important issues 
related to the U.S.-Lebanon relationship, I ask 
all Members to join me in remembering those 
who died in the tragic blast as well as those 
survivors who depend on the comfort and sup-
port of others to maintain hope for the future 
of Lebanon. We urge the caretaker Lebanese 
government to remove the political impedi-
ments brought by others so that a complete 
and thorough investigation can be concluded, 
and that justice will prevail.

HONORING MIKE JORDAN 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, 
today we honor the hard work and dedication 
of Illinoisan Mike Jordan. 
Whereas, Mike Jordan is retiring from his 
position on July 31, 2022 after serving as a 
State Farm Insurance agent for 43 years in 
Chicago’s South Suburbs; 
Whereas, Mike Jordan has been uplifted 
throughout his career by his wife, Patricia, and 
daughter Allison; 
Whereas, Mike Jordan always greets people 
with a smile on his face, a bounce in his step, 
and an eagerness to offer whatever help he

community of Park Forest, striving to improve 
the village by serving on the community’s Eco-
nomic Development Advisory Group as the

Whereas, Mike Jordan’s relationship with 
former President Barack Obama led him to 
encourage the former President to pursue the 
Presidency; and was active in former Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s campaigns for U.S. 
Senator and his two runs for the Presidency; 
Whereas, he has always sought to exceed 
his clients’ highest expectations, including by 
visiting a business owner’s business to inquire 
about storm and rain damage before the busi-
ness owner had time to initiate a request for 
service; 
Whereas, Mike Jordan kindly offered a ride 
home to a client after the client was involved 
in a late-night automobile accident; and the cli-
ent said ‘‘It’s not the policy. I just have the 
best insurance agent in the world!’’; 
Whereas, Mike Jordan is humble about his 
widespread influence on his community and 
his church, and serves as a mentor and advi-
sor to many fortunate people across the 
United States; 
Whereas, he has positively impacted so 
many people’s lives and helped countless 
families; 
Whereas, Mike Jordan ends every con-
versation in which he is engaged with an ex-
pression of gratitude; and now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the House of Representatives 
of the United States of America that the hard 
work and service of Mike Jordan be remem-
bered and honored.

OBSERVING THE PASSING OF DR. 
LOUISE BERRY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a mother to her community, Dr. 
Louise 
Berry 
of 
Danielson, 
Connecticut. 
Throughout her long life, Louise trail blazed a 
new standard of what it means to be a model 
citizen. Her impact on Eastern Connecticut is 
outsized and her legacy has been woven into 
the very fabric of our region. 
Born in November 1927, to Frances and 
Jacob Spaulding, Louise was raised within a 
family with a centuries-long history and just as 
deep roots tied to Northeastern Connecticut. 
Also raised among six brothers, she of course 
from a young age was instilled with the 
strength of self-advocacy. In 1945, Louise 
graduated from Killingly High School and at-
tended school at Adelphi University, earning 
her Nursing degree in 1948. Louise continued 
her education at the University of Connecticut, 
earning a bachelor’s degree in Zoology in 
1952 and a Master’s in Guidance and Coun-
seling in 1961. Ever a hard worker with a 
penchant for learning, Louise returned to 
school in the late 1970’s, and by 1980 she 
had earned her Juris Doctor from the UConn 
School of Law. 
Returning to 1952, however, Louise then 
picked up work within her community, serving 
as a school nurse at Killingly Memorial School 
until 1955. After bringing the first two of five 
children into the world, she returned to school 
nursing at Brooklyn School in 1958, sparking 
a career which would forever reshape the tra-
jectory of Brooklyn, Eastern Connecticut and 
our Nation as a whole. With her characteristic 
can-do attitude and determination, Louise set 
out on a path to become the most diversified 
and experienced staff in the Brooklyn school 
system, serving as a Guidance Counselor, Di-
rector of Instruction, and finally as Super-
intendent. Louise would serve as Super-
intendent for 36 years, the longest serving Su-
perintendent in Connecticut history. 
Though it is of course difficult to encap-
sulate the entirety of her tenure as super-
intendent, Louise used her position to pioneer 
programs and mold the field of education to 
her vision, for the better. Specific examples in-
clude her creating the first rural Head-Start 
program in the country and initiating one of 
the first preschool-for-all programs before it 
became the national norm. Such is why the 
Louise S. Berry Early Childhood Center at the 
Brooklyn School was dedicated in her name. 
Even the road leading into the schools of 
Brooklyn is named after her legacy, a re-
minder of just how important a community- 
based education was to Louise. 
As if the impact of her leadership within 
Brooklyn schools was not impressive enough 
in its own right, Louise was of course also 
very active in her town’s community up to the 
very end. Her long record of civic involvement 
existed as a dual track next to her career in 
public education, beginning with her election 
to the Town of Killingly Board of Education in 
1966. Just a few short years later, her capac-
ity for leadership earned her the position of 
chairwoman of the local board of education in 
the 1970s. She served on countless additional 
boards impacting the community in North-
eastern Connecticut, including Day Kimball 
Hospital, Eastern Connecticut Development 
Council, Connecticut Association of Public 
School Superintendents, and the UConn 
Board of Trustees, to name a few. 
Louise also played a crucial role in the es-
tablishment of Quinebaug Valley Community 
College, lobbying with her husband Richard to 
bring the college into existence in 1971—just 
more than 50 years ago today. Over the past 
half-century, Quinebaug has grown to exist as 
an epicenter of education in the Northeastern 
part of the state, having accredited thousands 
of students in higher education, regardless of 
age. With this well-developed record of advo-
cacy on behalf of her community, Louise un-
knowing put herself on a path to serving the 
region in a higher official capacity, particularly 
after volunteering on the discovery committee 
to recruit a 29th State Senate District can-
didate for the 1972 election. Little did Louise 
know at that moment that the exact same 
committee would end up choosing her as their 
recruit, ultimately causing her to run, win, and 
serve as one of three women in the Con-
necticut General Assembly’s 36-seat State 
Senate. Madam Speaker, having chaired and 
sat as a member on several Connecticut Gen-
eral Assembly Committees including the Pub-
lic Health and Safety Committee and the Edu-
cation Committee, State Senator Berry at that 
moment was once again operating as a trail-
blazer—a successful woman in leadership— 
breaking some of the glass in the ceiling so 
that others could follow in her footsteps to 
leave their community better than they found 
it.

July 29, 2022 
Louise’s excellence came from her being 
able to tackle multiple projects at once. Be-
tween all her many professional commitments, 
she made certain to stay dedicated to her 
family. A world traveler, Louise loved to vaca-
tion with her family in New Hampshire, Asia 
and everywhere in between. Though her leg-
acy clearly would do fine on its own, we have 
her five surviving children including Donald, 
Pamela, Robin, Christopher and Robin to ex-
tend her memory and example of community 
service into future Spaulding-Berry genera-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, Louise remains a towering 
figure in the history of Eastern Connecticut. It 
is for that very reason that, just like her chil-
dren, we in Congress also have a responsi-
bility to solidify the power of her life record. 
Though we are saddened by the void left by 
her passing, we know the region will continue 
to honor her as countless new leaders of both 
current and future generations continue to 
step into positions of action in her name. 
Those positions will exist in boundless form; 
from new state senators to new teachers, or 
even to those who base a life, career and 
family in Eastern Connecticut after gaining 
their foundations from the region—regardless, 
they will all contribute to their community in 
part because of Louise’s life work. To these 
ends, I ask that my colleagues in the House 
join me in honoring Dr. Louise Berry, a stew-
ard to her community and model citizen, set-
ting her name further into stone.

Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise

nel Timothy S. Sullivan and congratulate him 
on his retirement from the United States Air 
Force. Lt. Col. Sullivan serves as the Force 
Support Squadron Commander for the 131st

Force, and the great state of Missouri. 
Lt. Col. Sullivan is a distinguished graduate 
of the University of Missouri Reserve Officer 
Training Cadet (ROTC) program where he 
began his military career eighteen years ago. 
He is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Weap-
ons School Instructor course and is a com-

Sullivan is also a B–2 instructor and evaluator 
pilot with combat experience in operation Od-
yssey Lightning. He and his wife are the par-
ents of two sons. 
As an officer in the U.S. Air Force, Lt. Col. 
Sullivan continues to serve this nation with in-
tegrity and honor, always giving back to his

sionate advocate for ending the military sui-
cide epidemic and has gone above and be-
yond organizing events outside of work hours

HONORING CAM SHOLLY, YELLOW-
STONE NATIONAL PARK SUPER-
INTENDENT 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Yellowstone National Park Super-
intendent Cameron (Cam) Sholly and his staff 
for the outstanding leadership they dem-
onstrated in the face of a crisis situation, and 
to recognize their tireless efforts to address 
the needs of Yellowstone National Park and 
the surrounding communities after the dev-
astating flooding that took place there on June 
13, 2022. 
Cam and his staff went above and beyond 
in service to the communities surrounding the 
park, even those not directly affected by the 
flooding. During the weeks following the flood, 
they held public virtual meetings with commu-
nity stakeholders, oftentimes daily, to ensure 
the health, safety, and requirements of the 
people and businesses were being met. These 
meetings served as an opportunity to collabo-
rate on effective ways to reopen and provide 
admittance to the park. Cam and his team 
also worked closely with the Wyoming Con-
gressional Delegation and with state officials 
to ensure transparency throughout the cleanup 
and reopening processes. They all continue to 
check in with businesses and chambers of 
commerce in the communities several times a 
week to ensure that any outstanding issues 
are being addressed. 
Cam is a third-generation park service man-
ager and began his National Park Service Ca-
reer in 1990. He assumed duties as the Su-
perintendent of Yellowstone National Park in 
October of 2018. Yellowstone is one of the 
largest national park operations in the world 
spanning 2.2 million acres and receiving over 
4 million visits each year. The park has a 
team of over 1,000 employees and volunteers. 
Cam was awarded the Superintendent of the 
Year Award for the Southeast Region in 2011 
and the Department of Interior’s Meritorious 
Achievement Award in 2015 for his wide-rang-
ing executive leadership actions. Cam is also 
a veteran of the U.S. Army and deployed to 
Operation Desert Storm in 1991. 
I express my most sincere thanks and admi-
ration to Cam and his staff for their respon-
siveness and dedication to Wyoming and the 
communities surrounding Yellowstone National 
Park. Their exemplary service should serve as 
the gold standard for all governmental agen-
cies. 
HONORING THE ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE FOUNDING OF HUNTINGTON 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
IN 
NEWPORT 
NEWS, VIRGINIA 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Huntington High 
School on the anniversary of its founding more 
than 100 years ago. 
Located on the Virginia Peninsula, Hun-
tington High School was opened in 1920 as 
the first public high school for African-Amer-
ican youth in the city of Newport News. The 
school was named in honor of Collis Potter 
Huntington, founder of the Newport News 
Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and a 
developer of the Chesapeake and Ohio rail-
road, which he helped bring to Newport News. 
Huntington High School began as a class of 
just 52 students with one teacher in a small 
room at John Marshall Elementary School. 
The school eventually moved to its own four- 
room building on 18th Street in Newport 
News. The school continued to expand adding 
four additional rooms, making the structure 
two stories high. Huntington High School’s 
growth eventually required additional staff as 
well as the construction of a new campus on 
Orcutt Avenue that was completed in 1936. 
Additions were made to that new building in 
1945, 1947, and 1949. 
Huntington’s ‘‘Mighty Vikings’’ excelled in 
academics, sports, and music and helped earn 
Huntington a reputation as one of the most 
outstanding schools in Virginia. The spirited 
marching bands were renowned for their fa-
mous ‘‘Viking Call,’’ which could be heard 
throughout the neighborhood. The 48th and 
final class graduated in 1971, ending Hun-
tington High School’s five decades of fostering 
community hope, unity, and pride. It’s proud 
name and tradition continued on as an inter-
mediate school for eighth and ninth grades, 
and in 1981 the school’s storied building on 
Orcutt Avenue became Huntington Middle 
School, serving students in sixth through 
eighth grade. 
Madam Speaker, as the Newport News 
community gathers to celebrate over 100 
years since Huntington’s founding, I want to 
congratulate the alumni of this historic school 
and the work they have done to serve the City 
of Newport News and the greater Hampton 
Roads community.

away on June 7, 2022, at the age of 96. Bob’s 
life encapsulated the American principles of 
perseverance, 
endurance, 
and 
courage. 
Through his innovation and dedication, Bob 
left an indelible mark upon the Colorado com-
munity. 
In 1941, when the U.S. declared war 
against Japan, Bob and his family were sent 
to an internment camp in Topaz, Utah. With 
the assistance of his former high school teach-
er, who vouched for his character, Bob ob-
tained an early release from the internment 
camp and relocated to Brighton, Colorado, 
where he worked on a dairy farm. In 1944, 
Bob’s employer loaned him the money to pur-
chase 40 acres of farmland in Brighton. This 
land paved the way for Bob and his family to 
start a new life following World War II. 
Bob became a giant in Colorado’s agricul-
tural industry and was renowned for his inno-
vation in sweet corn growing. He transformed 
the industry in the 1980s with creative meth-
ods in seed development, consumer pack-
aging, and the introduction of Sakata Farms 
Gourmet Sweet Corn. Through a dedicated 
work ethic and the assistance of his loving 
wife Joanna, Bob’s farm would eventually 
grow from 40 acres to more than 3000 acres. 
Bob’s agricultural knowledge resulted in two 
presidential nominations to the Advisory Board 
of the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
As his farm and fame grew, Bob remained 
dedicated to giving back to his community. He 
served fifteen years on Colorado’s Water 
Quality Control Commission, working collabo-
ratively to find ways to address water short-
ages impacting Colorado’s farmers. Bob’s in-
genuity and charity led to his induction into the 
Colorado Business Hall of Fame and the Colo-
rado Agriculture Hall of Fame. Over the years, 
Bob was a member of the Colorado State Uni-
versity Extension Advisory Board, Colorado’s 
Food Safety Task Force, the Brighton Rotary 
Club, and the Brighton First Presbyterian 
Church. Furthermore, Bob spearheaded the 
campaign to build the National Japanese 
American Memorial to Patriotism in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Bob Sakata is an example of the American 
dream. On behalf of the Fourth District of Col-
orado, it is my honor to recognize his many 
accomplishments and his legacy of generosity, 
faith, courage, and perseverance.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MAJOR EARL ‘‘RUSTY’’ LES-
LIE RUSSELL, USA (RET.) 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Major 
Earl ‘‘Rusty’’ Leslie Russell, USA, Ret. Rusty 
exemplified the American fighting spirit. He 
lived his life honorably through serving his 
country, loving his family and friends, and de-
voting himself to his faith. Rusty embodied the 
bravery, honor, and patriotism of what it 
means to be an American. 
Born January 25, 1944, at Fort Sill, Okla-
homa, Rusty was n man of many talents, in-
terests, and pursuits. Most importantly, he was 
a loving husband, father, brother, uncle, and a 
man of God. 
At his core, Rusty was a deeply patriotic 
person. He began his military career in middle 
school in the Junior Reserve Officer Training 
Corps (JROTC) and continued to serve in the 
ROTC throughout his high school and college 
years. In September 1966, upon graduation 
from Fort Hays State University, Rusty re-
ceived his commission as a Second Lieuten-
ant in the United States Army. Soon after-
wards, Rusty attended the Army Aviation Cen-
ter and School at Foti Rucker, Alabama, 
where he earned his pilot wings. He served 
two tours in Vietnam (1967–68 and 1971–72) 
where he flew reconnaissance missions and 
aligned artillery. 
During these intense combat tours, Rusty 
earned the following military honors: Distin-
guished Flying Cross with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster, 
Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal with 
Oak Leaf Cluster, Army Meritorious Unit Cita-
tion, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam 
Service Medal with 7 Bronze Service Stars, 
Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star, and the 
Vietnam Campaign Medal with Palm. In 1975, 
having attained the rank of Major, Rusty was 
honorably discharged from the United States 
Army. 
Following his military career, Rusty and his 
wife, Jan, opened a real estate firm, Hallmark 
Homes, in Manhattan, Kansas. In 1982, the 
opportunity arose to join Edward Jones as a 
Financial Advisor. Without a backup plan, 
Rusty and Jan decided to move their family to 
Gainesville, Texas, to start their new adven-
ture. Throughout his quarter-century career 
with Edward Jones, Rusty was valued as a 
trusted advisor, educator, confidante, and 
mentor. 
Rusty was civic minded and generous with 
both his time and financial blessings. He 
served his community by participating on sev-
eral boards including the Gainesville Municipal 
Airport Board, the North Texas Medical Center 
Board, the First United Methodist Church 
Board, the State Bar of Texas Ethics Com-
mittee Board, and the Longhorn Council. 
Rusty was also an active member of the 
Gainesville Masonic Lodge No. 210 where he 
served as Past Master. 
A lifelong supporter of the Boy Scouts of 
America, Rusty earned the rank of Eagle 
Scout and later in life, the Order of the Arrow’s 
Vigil Honor. He served as leader of Gaines-
ville’s Troop 668 for many years, mentoring 
new generations of Scouts. He lived his life 
according to Scout Law, to be: Trustworthy, 
Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obe-
dient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and 
Reverent. 
Rusty will be truly missed by everyone he 
met and by the community he so deeply af-
fected. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, 
Jan, and their son, Lee. Rusty was a friend to 
all, and I join his family, friends, and the peo-
ple of Gainesville, Texas in celebrating Major 
Russell’s life and legacy.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
MT. 
ZION 
CHURCH OF ONTARIO 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of Mt. Zion Church—a pillar of the On-
tario community and the Inland Empire region. 
Since Mt. Zion’s founding in 1922, the 
church has stood resolute to its values by ad-
vocating for civil rights and supporting the 
growth of Ontario and the community. Over 
the past century, Mt. Zion has witnessed 
events like the Great Depression, the desegre-
gation of the Ontario Police and Fire Depart-
ments, and much more. Through it all, the 
church has been a source of peace and secu-
rity to our community. Mt. Zion continues to 
pour into the people of the Inland Empire with 
their food assistance, preschool, and their 
English as a Second language programs. Now 
more than ever, their compassion is needed 
as our nation faces unique challenges. 
Under Pastor Kennedy’s leadership, Mt. 
Zion has kept our community together and 
provided critical services during a pandemic 
that has rippled through our lives. Mt. Zion is 
a source of comfort for many families who 
have experienced loss during the pandemic 
and reminds me of what it looks like to sup-
port the working families in the Inland Empire. 
Partners in the Inland Empire community 
like Mt. Zion, Senior Pastor Dr. Brian E. Ken-
nedy and his wife Lady Hilda Kennedy are in-
valuable as we try to fix the issues facing On-
tario and our region. I will continue working 
with the Mt. Zion community to bring further 
opportunities and support to our home and 
neighbors. 
For the remarkable and incalculable con-
tributions to our community, it is my honor to 
recognize the 100th anniversary of Mt. Zion 
Church of Ontario. The church’s decades of

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
ROSEMARY O’NEILL 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the life of Rosemary O’Neill, 
who dedicated her life and career to public 
service. 
A native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and 
daughter of former Speaker of the House, 
Thomas ‘‘Tip’’ and Millie O’Neill, Rosemary 
was born on March 20, 1943. Following in the 
family tradition of public service and diplo-
macy, Rosemary first began what would be an 
extensive career with the Department of State 
as special assistant to George Feldman, Am-
bassador of Malta and Luxembourg, shortly 
after graduating from Dunbarton College of the 
Holy Cross. Rosemary then continued to work 
at the Department of State’s headquarters in 
Washington, D.C. for several years, before re-
ceiving her posting as a foreign service officer 
in Morocco in 1980. 
In 1992, Rosemary was elected chair of the 
Secretary of State’s Open Forum, and was 
tasked with supervising the Open Forum 
Channel, monitoring the Dissent Channel, and 
managing the Open Forum’s Speaker Pro-
gram. The Secretary of State’s Open Forum 
was established in 1967 to encourage U.S. 
government employees to share new or alter-
native policy recommendations with the Sec-
retary of State in a confidential manner, free of 
bureaucratic restraints. Under Rosemary’s 
leadership and guidance, the Speaker’s Pro-
gram and Open Forum Working Group on 
Conflict Resolution, Civil Society, and Democ-
racy flourished. 
An advocate for strong American Irish rela-
tions, Rosemary served as advisor to the De-
partment of State’s Director of Policy Planning 
on Northern Ireland. Even in retirement, Rose-
mary continued her relationship with the 
Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition and often 
travelled to her family’s ancestral home of 
Mallow, County Cork, serving as the Grand 
Marshall of Mallow’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade 
in 2017. Whether travelling to the USSR to 
promote human rights for individuals with dis-
abilities or working to establish the State De-
partment’s Afghan Women’s Program to ad-
vance educational opportunities for women 
and girls throughout Afghanistan—Rosemary 
dedicated her life and career to bettering the 
lives of all, across the globe. 
After a remarkable career as a Foreign 
Service Officer, Rosemary retired in 2004. 
However, retirement did not stop her from 
continuing to help and support those in her 
community. Rosemary went on to serve as 
Chair of the Board of the Family Pantry of 
Cape Cod and on the Harwich Democratic 
Committee. Surrounded by family and loved 
ones, Rosemary left us too soon on July 20, 
2022, at the age of 79. Rosemary’s legacy will 
carry on through the lasting impact she left on 
the lives of so many through her work advanc-
ing women’s rights and advocating for under-
represented and underserved groups. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
life of Rosemary O’Neill. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing her life’s com-
mitment to serving her community and coun-
try.

HONORING RICK JOHNSON 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Mr. Rick John-
son from his position as Executive Director of 
the Old Monterey Business Association and 
Administrator of the Lighthouse District. After 
more than twenty years of dedicated service, 
Mr. Johnson is the longest serving leader of 
any business association, not just on the Cen-
tral Coast, but in the state of California. 
The Old Monterey Business Association 
strives to promote Old Monterey’s economic 
vitality and preserve its community spirit, as 
well as enhance its one-of-a-kind downtown. 
The Lighthouse District is home to the Mon-
terey Bay Aquarium and over 100 intriguing 
specialty shops, restaurants, and nightlife es-
tablishments. 
Born in Minnesota, Mr. Johnson was sta-
tioned at the Defense Language Institute at 
the Presidio of Monterey in 1968 at the age of 
19. After retiring from the U.S. Army, Mr. 
Johnson began his civilian career in Monterey, 
earning $1.35 an hour at the Regency Theatre 
on Alvarado Street. After briefly leaving the 
Central Coast to pursue higher education, he 
returned to Monterey and continued to foster 
strong relationships in the community. 
Mr. Johnson’s expertise and knowledge of 
the Central Coast, paired with his sense of 
humor, served him well during his time with 
the Old Monterey Business Association and 
the Lighthouse District. In his capacity, he fre-
quently provided the Business Association 
with in-depth knowledge of government infra-
structure and local businesses, guided deci-
sion making, and oversaw the day-to-day rela-
tions between hundreds of local businesses 
and city government. Mr. Johnson is no 
stranger to disaster, and led the business 
community through flooding, a 2007 fire on Al-
varado Street, and the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Time and time again, Mr. Johnson’s leader-
ship served as a catalyst for positive engage-
ment and economic recovery and improve-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Rick Johnson for his decades of 
service. His leadership and dedication to pub-
lic service have shaped Monterey and greatly 
influenced the role of the Business Association 
in the community. I extend my personal appre-
ciation to Mr. Rick Johnson and his dedication 
to our local economy and business commu-
nity. 
CELEBRATING FORGOTTEN STAR 
BREWING CO. 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Forgotten Star Brewing Company for 
winning multiple awards at the 2022 U.S. 
Open Beer Championship. Forgotten Star re-
ceived two gold medals and two silver medals 
and was recognized as one of America’s Top 
Ten Breweries earlier this month. 
Every year, hundreds of breweries around 
the country compete across 150 categories of 
beer. A panel of experts judge these submis-
sions and names the country’s best beers. 
Forgotten Star won gold medals for their 
Bonspiel Bock and Nut N’ Honey Nut Ale, and 
they won silver medals for their Schwarzbier 
and Northstar Cream Ale. By winning these 
medals, they were also selected as one of the 
ten best breweries nationwide. 
Forgotten Star Brewing Company was 
founded in November 2019 by Matt Asay and 
Andy Risvold, and Mr. Asay serves as Head 
Brewer. The brewery is located in the historic 
Northern Pump Company factory, which pro-
duced Navy ship guns during World War II. 
That company was one of only eight nation-
wide that received superior recognition from 
the U.S. federal government for ‘‘Excellence in 
Production.’’ Forgotten Star is proud to carry 
on their legacy of excellence. 
Although I do not drink myself, I have deep 
appreciation for Forgotten Star’s craft and ar-
tistry. My constituents tell me these awards 
are well-deserved, and I join them in cele-
brating Forgotten Star’s success at the U.S. 
Open Beer Championship.

CONWAY COUNTY FAMILY FARM 
OF THE YEAR 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 2022 Conway County Family 
Farm of the Year, the Stobaugh Brother Fam-
ily Farm. 
Right off Highway 64, the Stobaugh family 
has been operating their family farm since the 
1950s, producing soybeans, rice, and corn 
over 6,000 acres of land. 
Known for their first-class quality of crops, 
the Stobaugh’s continue to utilize traditional 
farming methods while welcoming advance-
ments in agricultural technology. These ad-
vancements include weather stations through-
out the farm, and innovative irrigation system, 
and computerized calculations to ensure effi-
ciency. 
Despite labor shortages and the rising infla-
tion currently plaguing our agricultural industry, 
the Stobaughs continue to produce staple 
goods for many to enjoy at their dinner table. 
Congratulations to the Stobaughs and I 
thank them for being part of the family farms 
that feed 86 percent of what feeds American 
families every night.

HONORING WESTON VIVIAN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy of Wes-
ton Vivian. His contributions to the Ann Arbor 
community and the nation are worthy of com-
mendation. 
Weston was born in Newfoundland in 1924, 
but grew up in Rhode Island after moving to 
the United States at the age of five. He en-
listed in the Navy V–12 College Training Pro-
gram, which enabled him to earn his bach-
elor’s degree and master’s degree in electrical 
engineering. After attending Union College 
and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, his education culminated with a Ph.D. 
in electrical engineering from the University of 
Michigan in 1959. While working toward his 
Ph.D., Weston was involved in many tech 
start-ups as well as research and lecturing at 
the University of Michigan. He was also the 
Chairman of the Ann Arbor City Democratic 
Committee from 1959 to 1961. 
After establishing himself as a dedicated 
leader within the Ann Arbor community, Wes-
ton was the first professional engineer elected 
to the United States House of Representatives 
in 1964. Throughout his term, Weston im-
mersed himself in several landmark move-
ments. In February 1965, he traveled to 
Selma, Alabama with a congressional delega-
tion to meet with Martin Luther King, Jr. Even 
in just one term, he worked closely with my 
husband, John Dingell, to pass the Voting 
Rights Act and the Social Security Amend-
ments, eventually leading to the creation of 
Medicare and Medicaid. 
Weston will be remembered as a dedicated 
public servant who committed his life to mak-
ing Michigan a better place. Even after leaving 
Congress, 
Weston 
remained 
active 
in 
bettering his community. He volunteered his 
time working to advance science and tech-
nology, served as a faculty member at the 
University of Michigan, and served on the 
Michigan Transportation Commission from 
1978 to 1987. He routinely participated in the 
Ann Arbor Independence Day Parade and Ann 
Arbor Art Fair, and he spent his free time sail-
ing across the Great Lakes. After moving out 
of his house and into a senior living center in 
2011, his home was converted into the Ann 
Arbor Area Nature Preserve office—a testa-
ment to his appreciation of our great outdoors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the life of Weston Viv-
ian and extending my heartfelt condolences to 
his surviving family. I am proud to honor his 
legacy as a talented educator, scientist, and 
devoted public servant.

HONORING SERGEANT MICHAEL 
‘‘MICKEY’’ BLACKMON 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to honor Sergeant Michael ‘‘Mickey’’ 
Blackmon of the Potter County Sheriffs Office 
as he retires after 48 years in law enforce-
ment. For the last 19 years, Sgt. Blackmon 
has served the fine people of Potter County 
with distinction. I know I speak for his col-
leagues at the Potter County Sheriffs Office, 
and for the entire community, when I say we 
are grateful for his service and wish him well 
in retirement. 
Sgt. Blackmon’s career has been defined by 
service. Particularly as Crime Prevention Ser-
geant for the Sheriff’s Office, he has made an 
important mark through his instruction of the 
Potter County Citizens Academy, Student 
Academies, safety classes, and CRASE. Sgt. 
Blackmon has also been a familiar face to the 
community as he kept us safe at hockey 
games, car shows, local schools, and many 
other local events. 
Sgt. Blackmon will be missed, but thankfully 
he isn’t going far. He is described as an inspi-
ration to law enforcement and a great friend to 
many. Even though Sgt. Blackmon is retiring, 
his legacy will live on through the countless 
people he trained in his classes and seminars, 
and though the positive impact he had on resi-
dents daily for so many years. 
I wish Sgt. Blackmon the very best as he re-
tires and enters this next chapter, and I thank 
him for his dedicated service to the people of 
West Texas.

HONORING 
SUMNER 
COUNTY 
MAYOR ANTHONY HOLT ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor a great Tennessean and public servant, 
Sumner County Mayor Anthony Holt. 
Mayor Holt was born in 1956 and spent his 
childhood in the Neely’s Bend area of Madi-
son, TN, in Davidson County. In 1974, he 
graduated from Madison High School in Madi-
son, Tennessee. From there he went on to at-
tend college and graduate with cum laude dis-
tinction from the University of Memphis in 
1980, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 
Business Administration. 
Thirty years later he decided to continue his 
formal education by earning his Certified Pub-
lic Administrator certificate from the University 
of Tennessee, even though I’m sure he could 
have written the textbook by then. Mayor Holt 
retired from American Airlines in 2008 after 
holding various financial and accounting roles 
during his tenure there. Additionally, he has 
owned and operated a number of small busi-
nesses throughout his time living in Sumner 
County. 
For eighteen years, from 1990 to 2008, he 
served as a Sumner County Commissioner 
and was on the Planning Commission for the 
county during much of that time. In 2008, An-
thony Holt was elected to be the Sumner 
County Mayor during a special election. He 
was the perfect man for the job. Now, with his 
retirement on the horizon at the end of August 
of this year, he will be ending his fourth term 
in office as county mayor, serving a total of 
fourteen years in that position. 
During his time as county mayor he has 
represented Sumner County well and in many 
different capacities, including membership on 
the following: the Greater Nashville Regional 
Council (GNRC), serving as president from 
2019 to 2021; the Regional Transportation Au-
thority and Audit Committee; the Transpor-
tation Policy Board (TPB)/Metropolitan Plan-
ning Organization (MPO); the Mid-Cumberland 
Human Resource Agency; the Tennessee 
Central Economic Authority; the Middle Ten-
nessee Workforce Board; the Sumner Re-
gional Medical Center Board; the Middle Ten-
nessee Mayors’ Caucus; the Forward Sumner 
Economic Partnership Board; and the Emer-
gency Communications Center Board. 
Mayor Holt has received numerous distinc-
tions and awards for his service, including 
most recently the title of Mayor of the Year for 
2021 from the Council of Governments. Re-
ceiving this award for his laudable crises man-
agement of the Covid–19 pandemic and tire-
less leadership as Sumner County Mayor in 
2021, during what was arguably one of the 
most difficult years in which to govern in mod-
ern history, speaks volumes about Mayor Holt. 
On his retirement from Sumner County gov-
ernment, he will be starting a new career as 
the Executive Director of the Association of 
County Mayors for the State of Tennessee. In 
this new capacity, he hopes to visit all 95 
counties in Tennessee to better understand 
the needs of county mayors throughout the 
Volunteer State. 
He has faithfully served the good people of 
Sumner County, and now he will have an op-
portunity to serve the whole state. I am sure 
that he will do a tremendous job—as always— 
and his experience and passion for public 
service will be a shining example for all those 
lucky enough to cross his path. 
Mayor Anthony Holt deserves our undying 
gratitude for the highly effectual and ethical 
service he has delivered for Sumner County, 
Tennessee, and he certainly has my personal 
thanks and warm well wishes for a job ex-
tremely well done. I congratulate him on 
reaching this milestone in his career and life 
and on the beginning of his next professional 
chapter of service. I wish him and his wife 
Carla well in their future, and hope they enjoy 
spending more time traveling and working on 
their farm in Sumner County.
