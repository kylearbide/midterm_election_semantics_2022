f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a 
week ago the Nation reeled in horror as 
a deranged gunman shot and killed 
eight people at three different loca-
tions across the Atlanta area. Six of 
them were Asian-American women. 
Just 6 days later, another shooting. 
Ten people were shot and killed by a 
gunman who entered a grocery store in 
Boulder, CO. Some were customers, 
some were employees. One was as 
young as 20, and one was as old as 65. 
One of the victims was merely walk-
ing through the parking lot after fixing 
the coffee machines at the nearby 
Starbucks, the son of Serbian refugees 
and the shining hope of his family. 
One of the fallen was a local police 
officer, Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran 
of Boulder Police and a father of seven. 
You look at each of their faces—young, 
wise, older. You ache. Gone. You think 
of their families whom you don’t know. 
They never will see them again, taken 
so cruelly and so quickly. 
Today, flags around the Capitol will 
remain at half-staff in honor of the vic-
tims, and we all grieve with their fami-
lies. We also grieve with the commu-
nity of Boulder and the people of Colo-
rado. And we grieve with the people of 
Georgia and all people across the 
United States whose lives have been

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1724 
March 24, 2021 
forever marred by the plague of gun vi-
olence. 
COVID–19 is not the only epidemic 
claiming innocent lives in America. 
Last year alone, 20,000 Americans were 
killed by gun violence, the highest 
number in almost two decades. Most of 
these incidents never reached the head-
lines, but we cannot allow ourselves to 
become numb to their devastation. 
After one of the most difficult years in 
American history, we all want our lives 
and our country to return to normal. 
But not this normal—oh, no, not the 
normal that accepts everyday gun vio-
lence as a matter of course, an inci-
dental risk to living in these United 
States of America. We cannot, we must 
not accept that as normal. We must 
not shrink from our moral obligation 
to act. 
Two years ago, the Republican lead-
er, then in the majority, promised that 
this Chamber would have a real debate 
on gun violence in this country. It 
never happened. Even the former Presi-
dent made some noises about sup-
porting commonsense gun safety meas-
ures before quickly retreating, the re-
sult, once again, of bitter, reflexive op-
position by the NRA to any progress 
and fear among so many Republicans of 
what the NRA might do to them if they 
spoke truth to power. 
Well, now we don’t have a Republican 
majority. We have a Democratic one. 
This time is going to be different. A 
Democratic majority in the Senate is 
going to act. I have committed to put 
legislation 
to 
expand 
background 
checks on the floor of the Senate. We 
will debate it. We will vote on it. 
Just yesterday, my colleague Sen-
ator DURBIN led the Judiciary Com-
mittee in hearing from scores of wit-
nesses about proposals to reduce gun 
violence that the Senate might take 
up. 
I have started the process to make 
legislation to combat hate crimes 
against Asian Americans, led by Sen-
ators HIRONO and Representative MENG 
in the House, available for action on 
the floor. 
I have been told by so many Asians 
in New York that they are afraid just 
to walk down the street, something 
they used to do easily. I have seen the 
pain and fear in their faces as I have 
attended the rallies in New York. 
Make no mistake, under the Demo-
cratic majority the Senate will debate 
and address the epidemic of gun vio-
lence in this country. 
f 
NOMINATION OF RACHEL LELAND 
LEVINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the Levine nomination, today, the 
Senate will confirm the nomination of 
Rachel 
Levine, 
Pennsylvania’s 
top 
health official, to be the next Assistant 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
has 
brought many historic firsts into its 
ranks, including the first openly gay 
Cabinet Secretary of any Agency. The 
confirmation of Rachel Levine rep-
resents another important milestone 
for the American LGBTQ community. 
She will be the first openly transgender 
official ever confirmed by the U.S. Sen-
ate. The arc of history is long, but it 
keeps bending in the direction of jus-
tice. 
As 
transgender 
Americans 
suffer 
higher rates of abuse, homelessness, 
and depression than almost every other 
group, it is important to have national 
figures like Dr. Levine, who, by virtue 
of being in the public spotlight, will 
help break down barriers of ignorance 
and fear. 
Pennsylvania’s political leaders say 
Dr. Levine has forced people in their 
State 
to 
better 
understand 
the 
transgender community. One State leg-
islator said: 
She has robbed people of the false premise 
that they don’t know any trans people and 
therefore don’t need to be respectful of trans 
people. 
The historic nature of her nomina-
tion should not be lost on anyone, but 
Dr. Levine thoroughly deserves to be 
confirmed on the strength of her quali-
fications. 
Despite several attacks on her gender 
identity over the past year, Dr. Levine 
has stayed laser-focused on helping the 
State of Pennsylvania manage and re-
spond to COVID. The quality of her 
public service is reflected in the fact 
that she was confirmed not once, not 
twice, but three times by the Repub-
lican-led State senate to serve first as 
physician general and then as health 
secretary. 
The U.S. Senate should follow suit 
today and make Dr. Levine the Assist-
ant Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on one 
more issue, I was just over at the Rules 
Committee hearing. It is the first hear-
ing I attended as majority leader be-
cause it was about S. 1, so important. 
And there, I showed—I showed my 
anger and frustration at what Repub-
lican legislatures are attempting to do 
throughout the country, take away 
people’s right to vote, particularly peo-
ple of color. 
You know, it has been more than 160 
years since the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments abolished slavery, but 
Jim Crow is still with us. When a State 
says you need a notary public to cast 
an absentee ballot, it is no different 
than asking African Americans to 
guess the number of jellybeans in the 
jar before they vote. It is certainly no 
different in intent to deprive them of 
their right, their constitutional right 
to vote. 
And here we have Republican Sen-
ators making excuses for these vicious 
and often bigoted deprivations of the 
right to vote. They say that this is a 
State issue. No, Congress has passed 
numerous laws dealing with Federal 
voting rights, and, in fact, the Con-
stitution explicitly says that the Con-
gress has the ability and right to do it. 
And yet Republicans who lost the elec-
tion, instead of doing what we should 
be doing in a democracy—when you 
lose, you are supposed to figure out 
why you lost and win over the voters 
you didn’t, but they would just deprive 
the voters who voted against them of 
the right to vote. That is eerily remi-
niscent of what dictators like Erdogan 
in Turkey or Orban in Hungary would 
do. 
Our Republican Party has sunk so 
low that they have a Republican leader 
who is over in the Rules Committee de-
fending these actions by State legisla-
tures. 
I asked him and all the Republicans 
to give us a reason. Why did the Geor-
gia Legislature only pick Sundays to 
say there should be no early voting on 
Sunday? We know why. It is because 
that is the day African Americans vote 
in the ‘‘souls to the polls’’ operation, 
where they go from church to vote. It 
is despicable. 
Every time you think the country 
has moved a long way, you see steps 
taken backward. Let’s make no mis-
take about it, the shadow of Donald 
Trump—his big lie, his incessant focus 
on doing anything that benefits him, 
no matter if it is the truth or not, if it 
is constitutional or not, if it is racist 
or not—has now fallen over this party, 
and they are not even standing up to 
protect the sacred right to vote. 
Shame, shame, shame on all of them. 
Shame. How can you defend these ac-
tions throughout legislatures, which 
the 
Washington 
Post 
said 
would 
amount to tens of millions of people 
losing their right to vote? 
Are we a democracy? Are we? The 
shadow of Donald Trump falls dark and 
large over this caucus when they act 
like that, and it happens far too often. 
We will not let this stand. We will not 
let this stand. S. 1 will pass this body. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1725 
March 24, 2021 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nominations en bloc, which the 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nations of Rachel Leland Levine, of 
Pennsylvania, to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services; 
and David Turk, of Maryland, to be 
Deputy Secretary of Energy. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have 
come down to the floor multiple times 
in the past week to talk about the fili-
buster. I have talked a lot about the 
dangers of eliminating the filibuster, 
from the loss of bipartisanship to the 
loss of meaningful representation for 
Senate minorities and the constituents 
they serve. 
One thing I haven’t mentioned yet, 
though, is the fact that Democrats are 
increasingly calling for eliminating the 
filibuster despite the fact that Repub-
licans haven’t actually filibustered any 
legislation yet this Congress. 
In fact, the Democratic leader was 
just down here talking about attacking 
the Republicans for opposing H.R. 1, S. 
1, or whatever it is that is the election 
bill that Democrats have put forward, 
but there hasn’t been any effort that I 
am aware of to reach out to Repub-
licans to talk about things that they 
might want to be involved with in 
terms of election reforms or reforming 
our election system in this country. In 
fact, this last election, we saw record 
turnout. Millions of people more than 
the previous election came out and 
voted. It was run by the States across 
the country. 
The proposal that is before us, the 
H.R. 1 proposal—now, I guess, S. 1— 
would attempt to federalize that elec-
tion process, to nationalize the elec-
tions, to take the power away from the 
States that currently administer and 
run elections and have that run out of 
Washington, DC. 
It seems to me that a lot of people 
across this country would rather deal 
with State leaders, State Governments, 
when it comes to administering our 
elections than having them run out of 
Washington, DC. 
There are lots of other provisions in 
that bill that many of us would object 
to. I think, frankly, it is a good thing 
to have a photo ID to vote. That is 
something that my State of South Da-
kota has. I think it makes sense, when 
people come in to vote, to be able to 
prove who they are. Obviously, it is a 
voter fraud prevention measure that 
has been adopted by many States 
across the country and upheld by the 
courts. 
It just strikes me that there are a lot 
of provisions in that bill that would 
need to be fixed, honestly. And, frank-
ly, just the very premise to have the 
Federal Government running elections 
in this country, essentially taking over 
something that has been historically 
handled by the States, strikes me that 
that would be something the American 
people would have a lot of issues with. 
Now, I am not sure exactly what, 
given the fact that we had millions 
more voting in the 2020 election than 
the 
previous 
Presidential 
election, 
would suggest that we need to make 
changes to election laws across this 
country. 
The States, in my view, when they 
certified the election, like they typi-
cally do, in the 2020 election, did it on 
time, in accordance with the law, and 
the system, I believe, worked pretty 
well. But the Democrats seem to be-
lieve that there need to be changes in 
our elections. 
But my point, simply, with respect to 
their arguments about that and about 
the need to eliminate the filibuster in 
order to do it is that we haven’t filibus-
tered anything yet. 
Now, Democrats, when they were in 
the minority the last 6 years, filibus-
tered most things that we brought up 
that were of major consequence, legis-
lation that they objected to. They have 
used the filibuster prolifically—prolifi-
cally, you could say—in the last 6 
years. But it seems a little bit odd to 
have them getting up and talking 
about eliminating something that has 
been a part of Senate history, Senate 
rules, Senate traditions for a really 
long time and arguing that the reason 
they need to do that is that Repub-
licans have been abusing it when we 
have been in the majority. 
We have been in the majority for the 
last 6 years. The filibuster is a tool em-
ployed by the minority and was em-
ployed, I would say, very freely by the 
minority in the past 6 years. We 
haven’t 
filibustered—Republicans 
haven’t filibustered anything yet, leg-
islation, in this Congress. Yet Demo-
crats are talking about eliminating the 
filibuster and, frankly, without at-
tempting to reach across the aisle and 
engage in talks with Republicans about 
areas where we might find common 
ground. So that is what I want to talk 
just a little bit about today because I 
think Republicans have shown a gen-
uine commitment to bipartisanship 
and unity, something that has not been 
on display from the President or the 
Democrat leadership. 
The 
Senate 
confirmed 
President 
Biden’s Cabinet nominees faster than 
those of both President Trump and 
President Obama, thanks in no small 
part to Republicans’ willingness to 
move the process along, and many, if 
not most, of those confirmations were 
bipartisan. 
I voted for a number of President 
Biden’s Cabinet nominees not because 
they were the individuals I would have 
picked but because I believe that, ab-
sent serious red flags, a President de-
serves to have his team around him. 
So I have a suggestion for Demo-
crats: Why not try bipartisanship? And 
by that I don’t mean holding Repub-
licans hostage the way the Democratic 
leader has threatened, quote, ‘‘Support 
our legislation or we will talk about 
eliminating the filibuster.’’ 
I don’t mean passing a few pieces of 
bipartisan legislation for show and 
then showing through the rest of your 
agenda or trying to—I should say shov-
ing through the rest of your agenda 
through reconciliation or abolishment 
of the filibuster; I mean genuine bipar-
tisanship: sitting down at the table, 
identifying big issues that we need to 
address, and then looking at proposals 
from both parties—both parties—and 
negotiating until we can find agree-
ment. There is a lot of room for that. 
While the focus often tends to be on 
the areas where we disagree, there are 
plenty of areas where Democrats and 
Republicans either already agree or 
could easily reach middle ground. 
I am a conservative, but I have intro-
duced 14 bills so far this year, and 11 of 
them have had Democrat cosponsors. 
There is a lot of room for us to work 
together, so why don’t Democrats try 
that? We could start with American 
economic competitiveness and global 
leadership legislation or infrastructure 
legislation—issues that both Demo-
crats and Republicans see a pressing 
need to address. 
The Democratic leader has men-
tioned his desire to bring up legislation 
regarding America’s competitiveness 
vis-a-vis China, and the Republican 
leader has agreed that it is an issue 
ripe for a bipartisan, regular-order 
process. 
There are a lot of areas where we 
could find bipartisan agreement on 
these issues: investing in our domestic 
manufacturing capacity so we don’t 
have to rely as heavily on China or 
other countries for essential products 
and technologies, promoting the devel-
opment of 5G technology here at home 
to ensure the United States wins the 
race to 5G, supply chain security, pro-
tecting our taxpayer-funded research 
and intellectual property from theft, 
and more. 
I recently introduced the bipartisan 
Network Security Trade Act with Sen-
ator FISCHER and Democratic Senators 
STABENOW and WARNER. Currently, one 
of the biggest suppliers of 5G equip-
ment worldwide is a Chinese company, 
Huawei, which is supported by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. American secu-
rity officials have raised concerns that 
much of Huawei’s equipment is built 
with ‘‘backdoors,’’ giving the Chinese 
Communist Party access to global 
communications networks. Our bill 
would address this potential security 
risk by making telecommunications 
security a key objective when negoti-
ating future trade deals. 
It is important that we encourage 
our trading partners and allies to keep 
suspect technology like Huawei out of 
their networks. The bipartisan Net-
work Security Trade Act would be a 
strong candidate for inclusion in a 
thoughtful, bipartisan measure meant 
to enhance our competitiveness with 
China if Democrats are willing to en-
gage in truly bipartisan legislating. 
I believe a strong China policy is a 
national priority, and I hope we will

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1726 
March 24, 2021 
consider a bill that addresses the many 
threats China poses in the near future, 
as long as Democrats don’t simply turn 
it into a means to promote their par-
tisan priorities under the guise of com-
peting with China. 
There is also a lot of bipartisan 
agreement to be found on infrastruc-
ture. In fact, there is a history of bi-
partisan collaboration on infrastruc-
ture legislation. 
Our last major infrastructure bill, 
the FAST Act, was supported by both 
Democrats and Republicans and was a 
remarkably successful bill. 
Last Congress, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee here in the 
Senate developed bipartisan infrastruc-
ture legislation. And there is no rea-
son—no 
reason 
at 
all—that 
we 
shouldn’t reach bipartisan agreement 
on a substantial infrastructure bill. 
I know a lot of us Senators from 
rural States, both Democrats and Re-
publicans, share a number of the same 
priorities for infrastructure legisla-
tion, like expanding broadband access 
in rural communities and ensuring 
that farmers and ranchers have a 
transportation system they can depend 
on to get their goods to market. In-
vestments in rural infrastructure ben-
efit our entire economy. 
The vast majority of agricultural and 
industrial commodities originate in 
rural areas, and speeding the passage of 
those goods to market benefits every-
one—those who produce those commod-
ities and those who rely on being able 
to sell them or purchase them. 
I have introduced two pieces of legis-
lation with Democratic colleagues that 
I would hope to see included in poten-
tial bipartisan infrastructure legisla-
tion. 
I recently introduced the Railroad 
Rehabilitation and Financing Innova-
tion Act with my Democratic col-
leagues Senator HASSAN. Our bill takes 
important steps to improve the accessi-
bility of the Railroad Rehabilitation 
and Improvement Financing Loan Pro-
gram for smaller railroads, like those 
farmers and ranchers rely on to get 
their goods to market. 
I also recently introduced the Tribal 
Transportation 
Equity 
and 
Trans-
parency Improvement Act with my 
Democratic colleague Senator SINEMA. 
Tribes across the Nation have strug-
gled to build and maintain roads and 
bridges 
within 
their 
reservations, 
which connect Tribal members to crit-
ical services. This is especially true for 
large, land-based Tribes who must 
maintain vast road networks in sparse-
ly populated areas. Our bill would help 
Tribes address these challenges by tak-
ing steps to make the allocation of 
funding through the Tribal Transpor-
tation Program more equitable and 
transparent. 
If one thing is for sure, it is that a 50– 
50 Senate is not a mandate for one side 
to force through its agenda unchecked. 
It is absurd for Senate Democrats or 
House Democrats to pretend they have 
a mandate for a partisan revolution. 
I am not sure that the Democratic 
leadership realizes this, but I think 
there are a good number of rank-and- 
file Democrats who do. And I hope 
those rank-and-file Democrats will en-
courage their leaders to move away 
from their liberal fantasies and try for 
real bipartisan cooperation. 
There is a lot we can do together on 
a lot of issues if Democrats will come 
to the table. I hope they will. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let 
me salute my colleague and friend 
from South Dakota. I hope we can 
achieve what he has asked for: biparti-
sanship in the U.S. Senate. 
He made a point that I would like to 
amplify: that they have not even used 
the filibuster; Republicans have not in-
voked the filibuster so far during this 
Senate session. Well, there is a rea-
son—because the three things that we 
have done in this session are not, under 
the rules of the Senate, subject to fili-
buster. 
Let me note as well—I ask unani-
mous consent that I be given 10 min-
utes to speak before the rollcall begins. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there 
are three things that are not subject to 
a filibuster: an impeachment trial, 
which we have accomplished so far this 
year; the nominations, which the Sen-
ator from South Dakota alluded to; 
and the reconciliation bill. It is true, 
Republicans did not apply the fili-
buster to that. But it wasn’t their good 
will that motivated it; the Senate rules 
demanded it. 
The question is, Can we reach a point 
where we do things on a bipartisan 
basis, or will it be stopped by a fili-
buster? So let me pause at this mo-
ment and say to those following the de-
bate what a filibuster is all about. It is 
a time-honored tradition in the Senate, 
going back to Aaron Burr serving as 
Vice President, that people can speak 
in an unlimited fashion on the floor— 
there is nothing to stop them—until 
there came a cloture vote, which didn’t 
appear until the early 20th century. Be-
fore that, the Senator could hold the 
floor indefinitely and slow things down 
to a crawl, to a stop if necessary. The 
filibuster allowed them to continue 
that, but then came the cloture mo-
tion, which stopped the filibustering. It 
initially took a two-thirds vote, 67, and 
eventually 60 votes. But that is what it 
boils down to. 
If you want to get anything done on 
the floor and you don’t want one Sen-
ator to stand up and say ‘‘I refuse to 
accept the vote,’’ then you have to 
have 60 votes. So in a majority Senate, 
51 would clearly be sufficient. Under a 
filibuster, 60 is required. There are 50 
Democrats, 50 Republicans. Vice Presi-
dent KAMALA HARRIS can be the tie- 
breaking vote, the 51st vote. So the Re-
publicans, by applying the filibuster 
rule, could require 60 votes, which, of 
course, the Democrats by themselves, 
even with the Vice President, couldn’t 
come up with. 
There was a statement made by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, the Republican lead-
er, yesterday which was nothing short 
of amazing. At a press conference, he 
said of the filibuster: ‘‘It has no racial 
history at all—none.’’ Amazing that he 
would say that. 
If you go back and study the history 
of this body, John Caldwell Calhoun, a 
Senator from South Carolina, started 
in the early parts of the 19th century 
using this unlimited debate to protect 
slave States, to protect the interests of 
the Southern States. That progressed 
in history to the point where, in mod-
ern times, at least in the 20th century, 
the filibuster was used consistently to 
stop federalization of the crime of 
lynching. I don’t know who would 
argue in Kentucky or anywhere else 
that the crime of lynching has nothing 
to do with race, but the filibuster was 
used to prevent the federalization of 
that crime. 
It was used in an effort to stop the 
bills that were trying to outlaw a poll 
tax. Poll tax? That meant you had to 
pay to be able to vote. It was used in 
the South to try to discourage African 
Americans from voting. It clearly was 
racial, and the filibuster was used over 
and over again to protect a vote on the 
Senate floor, this Senate floor, from 
taking place on the poll tax. 
Then fast-forward several decades to 
the 1960s. Richard Russell of Georgia 
engineered—he was the architect, the 
legislative architect of the filibuster 
that stopped the civil rights bills in the 
1960s. Certainly Senator MCCONNELL, 
who was working in the Senate at that 
time as an intern, if I am not mis-
taken, must remember the filibuster 
being used against the civil rights bill. 
And to say that the filibuster ‘‘has no 
racial history at all—none’’ is to ignore 
the obvious. 
Here is the point we are getting to. 
Senator SCHUMER has said it on the 
floor, and others have said it as well. 
We have to be productive in this ses-
sion of the Senate. After the last 4 
years, we have seen the Senate really 
break down to the point where they 
weren’t productive at all. We weren’t 
productive at all. 
There were 29 amendment votes in 
the last year of Senator MCCONNELL’s 
reign as Republican leader. Twenty- 
nine amendment votes in 1 year? The 
previous year under Senator MCCON-
NELL: 22 amendment votes; no activity 
on the floor of the Senate. We can’t let 
that happen. There are things that 
need to be done. 
Let me mention, too, that one of 
them that certainly needs to be done is 
to protect America’s right to vote. The 
Senator from South Dakota comes and 
says: Well, we had this big turnout on 
November 3, 2020, and now the Demo-
crats are meeting and talking about 
changing the voting laws. Why would 
we want to change if we had such a big 
turnout?

S1727 
March 24, 2021 
He ignores what happened in be-
tween. After the election returns of No-
vember 3, 2020, Republicans across the 
Nation, in 40 different States, intro-
duced hundreds of bills to limit peo-
ple’s right to vote. That is why we are 
responding with this Federal response 
that is now being considered in the 
Senate Rules Committee. 
He missed part of the equation. It 
went from November 3rd’s big turnout 
to efforts in State legislatures to re-
strict turnout, to limit the rights of 
people to vote across America, espe-
cially African Americans and Latinos 
and those who are not wealthy—to 
limit their right to vote. And then 
came this response on the Federal 
basis. That is an important point. If we 
believed that the filibuster would not 
be used against it, if there was some 
promise that it wouldn’t be, we cer-
tainly could bring that bill to the floor 
for debate, and we should, if we are 
given that kind of assurance. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. President, the final point I want 
to make is regarding the hearing we 
held yesterday. It was a hearing before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee on 
guns and gun violence. I scheduled it 
last week, and I didn’t know as I sched-
uled it the tragedy that was occurring 
in Atlanta, GA, with eight people who 
were murdered. We heard about that. It 
was an outrage, these poor, innocent 
people killed—coincidentally, the ma-
jority of them Asian Americans—at a 
time 
when 
we 
know 
hate 
crimes 
against Asian Americans are on the 
rise. 
That was the day that I announced 
the hearing that occurred yesterday, 
but little did I know, as we prepared 2 
days ago for that hearing, what would 
happen in Boulder, CO, just 2 days ago 
when 10 innocent people were killed at 
a supermarket. 
We had a hearing yesterday. It was 
an important hearing. Members all at-
tended. Sadly, one of the members on 
the other side came in, the junior Sen-
ator from Texas, and characterized our 
hearing on gun violence, in light of 
what is happening in America, as ‘‘ri-
diculous 
theater.’’ Those were his 
words, ‘‘ridiculous theater.’’ There was 
nothing ridiculous about the hearing 
that we held yesterday. It was a matter 
of life and death. 
The grief that is being felt in Boul-
der, CO; Atlanta, GA; and all over 
America is a grief that is shared on a 
daily basis. Forty thousand Americans 
each year lose their lives to gun vio-
lence—40,000—a recordbreaking number 
and nothing we should be proud of as a 
nation. 
When we address gun violence and 
the measures that should be taken to 
reduce it, it is not ridiculous; it is as 
serious as it gets. Furthermore, it is 
not theater. Theater is a depiction of 
reality; the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee is reality. 
We are imparted, as Senators, to 
change the laws of America and make 
it safer. That is not a theatrical per-
formance; that is just discharging our 
duties as U.S. Senators. 
So I would say to that Senator and 
others, I agree completely with Sen-
ator SCHUMER. We need to bring bills to 
the floor that will reduce gun violence 
in America, keep firearms out of the 
hands of people who should not have 
them. Convicted felons and mentally 
unstable people should not be having 
guns and buying them and be able to 
kill innocent people who are just stop-
ping by the supermarket to pick up 
something to take home. That is what 
happened in Boulder, CO. 
As the stories are printed in news-
papers across America about those 
lives lost, it is a grim reminder that 
this is not ridiculous. It is not theater. 
It is a life-and-death issue which we 
have the power to change. 
I hope we can bring this measure to 
the floor, the one that passed the 
House of Representatives—and others— 
to bring sanity to our Second Amend-
ment, to make sure that we have con-
stitutional, commonsense gun safety 
that is consistent with any constitu-
tional right. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 132 
Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
It is obvious to just about everyone 
outside of Washington that the situa-
tion on our southern border is a crisis. 
I can’t believe that anyone wouldn’t 
believe that it is a crisis, but there are 
some who would answer that it isn’t a 
crisis. 
President Biden and the DHS Sec-
retary refused to call it a crisis. It is 
not just a challenge. They called it a 
challenge. This isn’t a challenge. This 
is a crisis. Ask anyone you see on the 
street if it is a crisis—people lined up, 
coming in illegally. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. Look at the facts. We have had a 
173-percent increase in border appre-
hensions compared with 1 year ago— 
173-percent increase. This past Feb-
ruary, apprehensions were at the high-
est total for February in 14 years. 
DHS admits that we are on track for 
the most illegal migrants in more than 
20 years. This is on the border. This is 
today. This is what is happening. 
Last week, mainstream media news 
reports found that the administration 
is restricting information Border Pa-
trol agents are allowed to share with 
the media about the crisis. The border 
agents claim that they are under an 
unofficial gag order. These are the bor-
der agents. These are the ones who do 
this for a living. They are down there. 
They are protecting our laws, stopping 
illegals from coming in. That is what 
their job description is, and yet they 
are under a gag order. 
They don’t want the media to find 
out. And they are being told to deny 
media requests for ride-alongs at the 
border. Now, that is so the media can 
tell the people of America what is 
going on down there, and they are 
being denied that opportunity. 
The DHS Secretary claims that he is 
committed to openness and trans-
parency, but this is not openness and 
transparency. This is hiding from the 
people what is going on. 
Maybe this administration is doing 
this and refusing to call it a crisis be-
cause their policies have invited this 
surge. This surge is coming as a result. 
President Biden has frozen funds 
from Congress directed for the building 
of the wall. He ended the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ asylum policy that was put 
there by the previous administration. 
It is a crisis. 
Illegal aliens know Biden is opening 
our borders up, and they intend to take 
advantage of that. And the illegals are 
wearing the Biden T-shirts. Do you see 
this photograph over here? There they 
are. Biden, we are coming in. 
I know a lot about the southern bor-
der because I have been there countless 
times, seeing firsthand the problems on 
both the Mexican side and the Amer-
ican side of the border. I was a builder 
and developer for 30 years down there. 
I know that border. I was there for 30 
years, all the way from Brownsville to 
McAllen, TX, on both sides. I know the 
individuals that are down there who 
are the career people protecting our 
borders. 
I am disappointed that the adminis-
tration is reversing the progress we 
have made over the past 4 years and 
shocked that they simply won’t ac-
knowledge it is a crisis. 
The border security should not be a 
partisan issue, and I am glad there are 
a few Senate Democrats who share my 
concern about this crisis. I applaud 
them for speaking out. It took guts to 
do it. 
Well, I have got a resolution, and I 
am going to introduce this resolution. 
I introduced it, actually, already. I 
think every Senator will agree with it. 
It is a simple resolution. 
We haven’t checked this out yet, but 
I think this might be the shortest reso-
lution in the history of the U.S. Sen-
ate. I am going to read it to you. 
It simply states: 
It is the sense of the Senate that the cur-
rent influx of migrants at the Southern land 
border of the United States constitutes a cri-
sis. 
That is it. Nothing more. 
So, with that, Mr. President, as in 
legislative session—this is a unanimous 
consent request, Mr. President. I am 
making it right now. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
132, submitted earlier today. I further 
ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
Colleagues, what is happening at the 
border right now is not just another 
policy matter to me; it is personal. 
When I see the young Latino chil-
dren, alone in an unfamiliar setting, 
being spoken to by law enforcement 
and other authorities in a language 
that they don’t understand, I actually 
can’t help but think of my three boys. 
My boys are the same ages as many of 
the kids presenting themselves at the 
border seeking asylum. 
They look just like those kids. I see 
the fear and desperation in the eyes of 
the children at the border, and I don’t 
have to imagine how my boys would 
look 
and 
feel 
under 
such 
cir-
cumstances. I have tasted that already. 
In 2018, we were on a family trip in 
Arizona—June of 2018. It was the 
height of Trump’s cruel family separa-
tion. We took a detour to Tornillo, TX, 
to demand humane treatment of the 
children who were being intentionally 
separated from their parents by the 
previous administration. 
On the way there, I tried to prepare 
my boys, mentally and emotionally, 
for what they were about to see. And it 
was my youngest son, Diego, who was 3 
years old at the time, who turned to 
me and said: Dad, Donald Trump is 
putting kids in cages. We got to go help 
them. 
My heart broke. Imagine how the 
children on the border today are feel-
ing. Imagine how scared they must be. 
Consider how traumatic their young 
lives have already been and how anx-
ious they are for the basic safety and 
comfort that so many people take for 
granted. 
Let’s think of their parents’ anguish, 
to be so desperate to protect their chil-
dren, to be so afraid for their safety, 
let alone their future, that they make 
the heartbreaking decision of sending 
them on a dangerous 2,000-mile journey 
to the U.S. border all alone, knowing 
that as risky and as dangerous as that 
journey is, it is safer than to stay in 
their own community. 
Let’s be clear. These are children. 
These are families, not that are well- 
off, trying to game the system. These 
are families who are desperate. Their 
communities have been ravaged by 
hurricanes, the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and in so many cases, decades of vio-
lence. Their families are threatened by 
gangs with torture and murder if they 
stay home. Asylum seekers aren’t just 
seeking a better life. Many are simply 
just trying to stay alive. 
Too many policymakers act like asy-
lum seekers are just choosing to come 
here, when there is really no choice at 
all. 
So I am deeply disappointed to see so 
many Members of Congress, both in the 
House and in the Senate, depicting des-
perate, young children at the border as 
some sort of threat to our Nation. As 
though 15,000 practically orphaned chil-
dren trying to assimilate into our 
country of 330 million is some sort of 
existential crisis for our Nation. 
The real crisis is the immigration 
laws that are so broken that children 
have to make a treacherous 2,000-mile 
journey to seek asylum here. The real 
crisis is that this situation distracts us 
from the more than 11 million undocu-
mented immigrants who have been liv-
ing in the United States for years, 
working and paying taxes in commu-
nities all across America while living

S1729 
March 24, 2021 
in constant fear of deportation. They 
are our neighbors, our teachers, our 
nurses, our grocery store workers, our 
childcare providers. They are the es-
sential workers whom we have all 
thanked each and every day through-
out this pandemic who live in constant 
fear that their lives will be upended 
and their families ripped apart at any 
moment, depending on the politics of 
the day in Washington. 
The real crisis is that we have 
strayed so far from our founding prin-
ciples as a Nation of immigrants and 
that we have strayed so far from the 
creed emblazoned on the very statue 
that we erected to welcome immi-
grants into New York Harbor saying: 
Give me your tired, your poor, your 
huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the 
wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send 
these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I 
lift my lamp beside the golden door! 
So I am disappointed but, sadly, not 
surprised that this resolution is noth-
ing more than a cynical attempt to 
perpetuate the semantic nonsense of 
the day. Our constituents didn’t send 
us to the Senate or to Congress to iden-
tify problems. They sent us here to de-
velop and enact solutions. 
I am more than willing to sit down 
with my colleague here to try to come 
up with some solutions to address what 
is happening at the border—solutions 
that address the lack of resources and 
the broken processes left by the pre-
vious administration, solutions that 
recognize the fundamental humanity of 
these desperate children and families 
who simply want to live to see their 
next birthday, and solutions that stay 
true to the values of this Nation. 
I have an amendment to the resolu-
tion at the desk to strike the text of 
the Inhofe resolution and to insert the 
following: 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that our outdated immigration laws and the 
lack of a pathway to citizenship for the 11 
million undocumented immigrants who form 
the backbone of communities across the 
United States constitutes a crisis and that 
the United States Senate must take up im-
migration reform this year. 
I ask that Senator INHOFE’s request 
be modified as follows: that the Padilla 
substitute amendment at the desk to 
the resolution be considered and agreed 
to; that the resolution, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. INHOFE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. PADILLA. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I hope 
everyone heard this. I haven’t met the 
Senator from California real well yet. I 
look forward to it. I look forward to 
serving with him, but I hope that ev-
eryone heard what is going on now: 
Just open the borders. 
You know, people in other coun-
tries—I won’t mention some of them 
because I don’t want them to be put in 
an awkward position—they say: Why in 
the world don’t we have stronger bor-
ders in the United States of America? 
And we don’t. 
Our previous President, I talked to 
him this morning. I talked to former 
President Trump this morning, and I 
talked about what is going on down 
there at the border. And the reason I 
am familiar with this—much more fa-
miliar than the Senator from Cali-
fornia or anyone else—is that I worked 
down there for 30 years on that border, 
all the way from Brownsville, TX, to 
McAllen. I know the border people 
down there. I know the agents down 
there. And for them to tell me that 
they have been told not to talk to the 
media about what is going on—I hope 
everyone knows what is going on right 
now, today. This is going on. 
You know, President Trump is all for 
people coming into America the legal 
way. He has made that very clear over 
and over again. He has spent time down 
on the border, both borders, making 
sure that we can have a legal—one of 
the most gratifying things in my job as 
a U.S. Senator, and I have been in 
these Chambers now since 1994—one of 
the most enjoyable things is to go to 
naturalization ceremonies. And you 
talk to these people who have come 
and worked to come across legally to 
our country. I defy you to find any one 
of these individuals who has come here 
legally and gone through this natu-
ralization process—they know more 
about the history of this country than 
people on the street, than people who 
were born here and people who are 
serving here in the U.S. Senate. They 
know the language. They learn the lan-
guage. They did it the hard way. How 
do you tell them: You have gone 
through all this in the process of be-
coming legal, but you didn’t have to do 
that. You just march right in. They are 
inviting you in. They want you in. 
Put it back up. Yes, that is what is 
going on right now. That is what is 
going on at the border. So I want ev-
eryone to know what is happening now. 
We can be sympathetic to a lot of 
people, but the idea of saying that we 
had a President who was putting kids 
in cages, come on. Let’s get real. We 
don’t want to do that. We don’t have to 
do that. We just want to make it very 
clear to the American people that we 
have borders, and we ought to be pro-
tecting these borders. 
A lot of the people who come in, they 
aren’t necessarily from Central Amer-
ica or from Mexico. These are—a lot of 
them are terrorists coming over. They 
are coming from the Middle East, com-
ing from all over the world, coming 
into our porous borders. 
Now, is that what people want? No, it 
is not. Overwhelmingly, they have re-
jected the idea of open borders, letting 
everyone come in. 
Well, we are to going stay with this, 
and I am going to resubmit this very 
simple resolution, as follows: 
It is the sense of the Senate that the cur-
rent influx of migrants at the southern land 
border of the United States constitutes a cri-
sis. 
It is a crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, Repub-
licans are going to be on the floor 
today, taking a sudden 100-percent sin-
cere interest in immigration reform. 
They are going to propose that the 
Senate take up a handful of bills to ad-
dress what they call a crisis created by 
President Biden on our southern bor-
der. 
Forgive me for being blunt, but give 
me a break. Republicans suddenly care 
about the border because they don’t 
want to talk about the real crisis that 
President Donald Trump created and 
that President Biden is fixing: the 
COVID crisis and our Nation’s eco-
nomic crisis. Republicans don’t want to 
fix our broken immigration laws. They 
want to distract Americans from the 
real story right now, which is the im-
plementation 
of 
the 
very 
popular 
American Rescue Plan. 
There are $1,400 checks that are ar-
riving in people’s bank accounts right 
now. 
School 
budgets 
finally 
have 
enough resources to catch up on all of 
the lost learning for our kids; child-
hood poverty is about to be cut in half; 
more production of vaccines. That is 
the real story. 
You know how I know the Repub-
licans are less than sincere in this in-
terest in immigration policy? First, be-
cause they controlled the Senate for 6 
years and not once during the roughly 
2,100 days that they were in charge did 
they try to honestly bring a com-
prehensive immigration reform pro-
posal to the floor. 
I checked. Two of the bills they are 
going to ask unanimous consent for 
today were brought up for show votes 
in the middle of the 2016 Presidential 
election as a means of helping Donald 
Trump’s candidacy, but in neither in-
stance was there actually any attempt 
to try to find common ground to actu-
ally pass something. 
Go back even further. In 2013, when 
Democrats were in the Senate, that is 
when we actually did pass a com-
prehensive immigration reform bill. 
But it was Republicans who opposed 
it—not all, but all of the opposition 
came from Republicans—and it was the 
House Republican majority that re-
fused to even consider the bill. That is 
where it died. So spare me this sudden 
concern for immigration policy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1730 
March 24, 2021 
But since Republicans are now newly 
concerned about what is happening on 
the border, it probably makes sense for 
us to level set the facts. The facts. So 
here are four of them. 
The first is a pretty simple one. Re-
publicans will tell you that Joe Biden 
created this crisis, that his policies are 
the reason why we have seen an in-
crease in migration to the border. But 
here is the chart, and I want you to 
zero in on the end of it. As you can see, 
apprehensions at the border, which are 
a pretty decent indication of the num-
ber of people who are crossing without 
documentation, started going up in the 
middle of 2020 precipitously. All that is 
occurring now is a continuation of 
these 
increases. 
Apprehensions 
and 
crossings at the border didn’t start in-
creasing on Inauguration Day; they 
started increasing back in the middle 
and end of 2020. So you can’t say that 
this was a creation of Joe Biden’s poli-
cies if what we are witnessing now is a 
continuation of a trend that began at 
the end of last year. In fact, as you can 
see here, the 10-year high for apprehen-
sions at the border happened right in 
the middle of the Trump administra-
tion—a time during which the Presi-
dent was crowing that his policies at 
the border were the toughest ever. 
Here is the second fact. The border is 
not open, as Republicans falsely claim. 
Here is what is happening right now on 
our southern border. Since the pan-
demic began, the administration in-
voked something called title 42 that al-
lows, temporarily, during a public 
health emergency, the Border Patrol to 
turn everyone back around and send 
them back into Mexico regardless of 
whether they have an asylum claim 
that is legitimate or not. Under law, 
that is a temporary authority that is 
only allowed to be used during a public 
health 
emergency, 
and 
President 
Trump was using that authority. 
The problem was that for these kids 
who were showing up at the border, 
who had legitimate asylum claims, 
right, whose lives were in danger in the 
places they were coming from, when we 
turned them around and sent them 
back to the Mexican border, we were 
essentially leaving them to die. Their 
parents weren’t there. The smugglers 
who brought them to the United States 
had already left. 
This was a disastrous, inhumane, un-
conscionable policy, to turn these kids 
back around to the border and leave 
them to the smugglers, to the sex traf-
fickers with no one to help. So the only 
change President Biden made was to 
say that these unaccompanied minors 
need to be protected; we need to proc-
ess their asylum claims. But President 
Biden is still turning around, under 
title 42 authority, every single adult, 
every group of adults, and every family 
who comes to the border, under title 42 
authority. 
The border is not open. All that has 
changed is that the prior law that was 
applied before the pandemic began is 
being applied selectively to unaccom-
panied minors. 
Let’s be clear. The authority to expel 
everybody being applied now to every-
body except for unaccompanied minors, 
that is a temporary authority—an au-
thority that Donald Trump didn’t even 
invoke until the pandemic began. 
Third, it is not even clear that what 
is happening now is anything other 
than a natural increase in migration 
during the winter, combined with the 
buildup of demand from title 42 en-
forcement in 2020. 
The Washington Post data analysts 
took a look at the recent data on bor-
der crossings year to year and month 
to month, and here is what they said: 
We looked at data from [the] U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection to see whether there’s 
a ‘‘crisis’’—or even a ‘‘surge,’’ as many news 
outlets have characterized it. We analyzed 
monthly CBP data from 2012 to now and [we] 
found no crisis or surge that can be attrib-
uted to Biden administration policies. Rath-
er, the current increase in apprehensions fits 
a predictable pattern of seasonal changes in 
undocumented immigration combined with a 
backlog 
of 
demand 
because 
of 
2020’s 
coronavirus border closure. 
What they are essentially saying is 
that because of conditions on the 
ground in Central America and Mexico, 
you saw an increase in crossings and 
apprehensions in 2018 and 2019 that van-
ished only in 2020 because of title 42 au-
thority that is now starting back up 
again. 
Again, the data backs this up. This 
year, from January to February, there 
was a 28-percent increase in crossings. 
January to February 2019, there was a 
31-percent increase. Go back to 2018; 
February to March, a 25-percent in-
crease. For the last 3 years, outside of 
the pandemic environment, during the 
winter, you will see a routine 25- to 30- 
percent increase in presentations at 
the border. This is when people nor-
mally cross, during the relatively cold-
er weather months of the winter. 
Second, these numbers are really de-
ceiving because these aren’t unique in-
dividuals; this is just total number of 
apprehensions. So what is happening 
under title 42 is that adults are being 
immediately removed right back to 
Mexico, but then they are immediately 
attempting to recross. So many of 
these numbers look high because you 
have individuals who never got the 
chance to make an asylum claim who 
are crossing multiple times at the bor-
der. 
The fourth fact is that there is little 
evidence that American policy at the 
border has much to do with migration 
rates. The evidence, the facts show 
that it is conditions on the ground in 
the origin nations that are what deter-
mine whether people pack up their 
homes and leave for America. 
Again, this chart is a good indication 
of that fact, because Donald Trump 
would tell you that his policies were 
tougher than anybody’s, but the 10- 
year high in crossings, apprehensions 
happened in the middle of Donald 
Trump’s 
inhumane 
border 
policies. 
Why? Because during this time, condi-
tions are abysmal. Violence is spiking 
in many places from which these mi-
grants are coming. 
Just as a matter of sort of further ex-
planation, if we brought this chart 
back into the Bush administration, you 
would find that crossings were much 
higher, at a much higher rate during 
the Bush administration than at any 
time during the Obama administration. 
People come to the United States be-
cause they are fleeing violence, they 
are fleeing economic desperation, not 
because of some message they get from 
the U.S. Government. 
One study I was looking at the other 
day, a comprehensive study of ration-
ales for crossings data on the times 
that people cross, says this: 
[T]ougher border controls have had re-
markably little influence on the propensity 
to migrate illegally. 
These are the facts. These are the 
facts. Republicans need to stop looking 
at immigration as a political oppor-
tunity. We need to start dealing with 
the truth. 
The number of immigrants showing 
up at the border today is large, but the 
winter increase isn’t bigger than either 
of the last two winters prior to the 
pandemic with respect to percentage 
increase. It didn’t start when Joe Biden 
became President or because of Joe 
Biden’s policies. The increase started 
last year, when Donald Trump was 
President. 
To the extent that Republicans op-
pose President Biden’s lifting of the 
title 42 removal proceedings for kids, 
what is your alternative? Do you sup-
port just dumping these kids, these 10- 
and 11-year-olds, on the other side of 
the border, scared and alone, and just 
leaving them to die or to be forced into 
the arms of drug cartels or traffickers 
in Northern Mexico? That is un-Amer-
ican, and I am glad my President chose 
to end that inhumane, temporary pol-
icy. 
But even if President Biden contin-
ued title 42 authority for kids for a few 
more months, expedited removal can’t 
last forever. The law doesn’t allow it. 
So once again, pretty soon, every mi-
grant is going to be able to have the 
chance to apply for asylum, as they 
should. And herein lies an opportunity. 
Let’s work together to fix what is a le-
gitimately broken system. 
I will give an example. People should 
be able to apply for asylum in the 
United States. We built this Nation by 
allowing people to come here from very 
dangerous places. But the asylum proc-
ess takes too long—years between 
when you present yourself at the bor-
der and when you get a final decision 
on whether you can stay in the United 
States. Let’s fix that. It is within our 
ability as Members of Congress to fix 
that. The administration can’t do it. 
They need resources. They need new 
law and new authorities. 
Republicans and Democrats could 
choose to—instead of playing politics, 
instead of offering up motions today 
that are sure to lose, we could sit down 
and try to do something about it. But

March 24, 2021 
for 6 years, Republicans had the oppor-
tunity to bring together a conversation 
around comprehensive immigration re-
form, and they didn’t. Hopefully, we 
will have the opportunity to do that 
now. 
Lastly, behind every single one of 
these individuals coming to the border 
is a story, is a real human being. Ask 
yourself, if your child were being re-
cruited into vicious drug gangs with a 
high likelihood of serious harm or 
death, would you not take steps to 
keep your child safe? Would you not 
bring them to a place like America 
that was safer for that child? 
I visited, on Friday, the southwest 
border. I was in El Paso with a group of 
bipartisan colleagues and Secretary 
Mayorkas, who is doing a good job, who 
is managing this emergency with skill. 
I met a little girl, about 13 years old, 
who was in one of these processing fa-
cilities waiting to be moved into the 
asylum process. She was truly scared. 
She was truly scared. She knew she 
was going to have a chance to reunite 
with her family in the United States, 
but these detention centers—they are 
better than they were in 2019, but they 
are no place for kids. 
That little girl was coming from 
Guatemala, a place where there are 
certain neighborhoods that are more 
violent than any war zone in the Mid-
dle East, a place where murder rates 
eclipse anything we can even imagine 
in the United States. 
So that little girl, she needs America 
to survive, but I would argue that 
America needs her more because with-
out her and the thousands of other 
children arriving at our border, hungry 
for a better life, we are going to risk 
abandoning the entire original idea of 
this great, one-of-a-kind Nation, a Na-
tion that opens its arms to those who 
are fleeing violence and desperation. It 
is not just our tradition; it is our defi-
nition as a country—more reason for 
those of us in the U.S. Senate to resist 
the temptation to play politics with 
these kids’ lives and with the very 
complicated, nuanced, important issue 
of immigration and instead find ways 
to be truthful about what is happening 
at the border as a means to come to-
gether and do something about it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PPP EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge swift passage of the PPP 
Extension Act, which will extend the 
March 31 deadline for the Paycheck 
Protection Program 2 months, to May 
31, and give the SBA an additional 
month, through June 30, to process any 
backlogged applications. 
This Saturday, March 27, will be the 
1-year date since the CARES Act was 
enacted. In that time, SBA has ap-
proved 8.2 million PPP loans worth 
more than $715 billion. 
These loans have saved small busi-
nesses throughout our Nation. They 
would not be here today but for this 
program. It also saved the stress on our 
unemployment insurance system by 
keeping small business employees on 
the payroll. And as I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer knows, for a small busi-
ness, it is difficult to find a workforce 
and to keep a workforce, and the Pay-
check 
Protection 
Program 
allowed 
small businesses to maintain their 
workforce so that when the pandemic 
is over, they are going to be ready for 
our growing economy. 
The world feels a little different 
today than it did a year ago. The 
American people are finally beginning 
to see a light at the end of the tunnel. 
More than 124 million vaccine doses 
have been administered, and public 
health officials nationwide are begin-
ning to ease restrictions on public 
gatherings. 
We can see a light at the end of the 
tunnel, but we are not there yet. Small 
businesses are struggling, but in spite 
of those struggles, small businesses are 
still showing up for our communities. 
The Baltimore Sun recently pub-
lished a story about a restaurant in my 
hometown of Baltimore that captured 
the essence of the value that small 
businesses bring to our communities. 
Steve Chu and Ephrem Abebe, co- 
owners of the popular restaurant in 
Baltimore 
named 
Ekiben, 
recently 
drove 6 hours from Baltimore to 
Vermont to prepare a meal for a long-
time customer who was on her death-
bed. They did this at their own cost be-
cause that is what small business own-
ers do. They are part of our commu-
nity. Afterward, Mr. Chu and Mr. 
Abebe called the decision a ‘‘no- 
brainer’’ and viewed their trip as a way 
to say thank you to a customer who 
had supported them for years. 
That is what makes small businesses 
special. They are more than places we 
go to buy products or enjoy a meal. 
They are vital pillars in our commu-
nity. That story and countless others 
like it are why we passed the PPP pro-
gram initially and why we must pass 
the PPP Extension Act—so PPP can 
continue to be a lifeline for small busi-
nesses in the coming months. 
Congress and the Biden administra-
tion have implemented significant im-
provements to the PPP in recent 
months that have made the program 
more equitable and useful. So we must 
now extend the deadline to allow small 
businesses and nonprofits to take full 
advantage and receive the help that 
they need. 
In December, Congress passed the bi-
partisan Economic Aid Act, which pro-
vided an additional $284 billion to PPP 
and made second-round PPP loans 
available to small businesses that had 
spent their initial PPP loan and can 
demonstrate a 25-percent loss in rev-
enue. The bill also expanded eligibility 
of PPP to include certain local news-
papers, TV stations and radio stations, 
as well as 501(c)6 nonprofits. 
I must remind my colleagues that 
while the SBA was beginning to imple-
ment the improvements we made to 
the PPP in the Economic Aid Act, the 
Agency was also undergoing a transi-
tion from the Trump administration to 
the Biden administration. Transitions, 
even under the best circumstances, can 
be disruptive to an Agency’s work. 
On February 22, the Biden adminis-
tration took strong action to get fund-
ing to small businesses that were ei-
ther left out or underfunded during 
prior rounds of PPP. The administra-
tion implemented a 14-day exclusive 
window for small businesses with fewer 
than 20 employees. It updated the max-
imum loan calculation formula for sole 
proprietors, and it eliminated rules 
prohibiting small businesses owned by 
formerly incarcerated individuals and 
individuals with delinquent Federal 
student loans from securing a PPP 
loan. 
It made it possible and much more 
worthwhile for small businesses to 
apply for PPP loans, but it takes time. 
PPP is a forgivable loan, but you have 
to have a financial institution to make 
that loan. It has to be processed, it has 
to be approved, and it can’t be done by 
the end of this month. 
During the exclusivity period, SBA 
approved PPP loans for more than 
400,000 small businesses and nonprofits 
with fewer than 20 employees, nearly 
half of which were first-time bor-
rowers. We are reaching the hard to 
serve, the most needy of the small 
businesses. They finally got help. 
Earlier this month, we passed the 
historic American Rescue Plan. The 
plan expanded PPP eligibility even 
more, to include more nonprofits as 
well as digital news platforms. The 
plan provides overdue aid to the local 
chapters of large nonprofits, such as 
the YMCA and Goodwill, which had not 
had prior access to PPP due to having 
multiple locations totaling more than 
500 employees. The plan makes these 
nonprofits eligible for PPP loans worth 
up to $10 million, as long as each loca-
tion does not exceed the employee 
limit. That makes sense. 
During a hearing examining PPP last 
week, the small business community 
heard testimony from John Hoey, who 
leads the YMCA chapter that serves 
the Baltimore region. John urged us to 
extend the PPP to give nonprofit lead-
ers more time to understand the pro-
gram. He said: 
I can tell you that colleagues of mine who 
run large Ys around the country and large 
nonprofits in Baltimore are still trying to 
understand the program and figure out if 
they qualify. I think a 3-month extension is 
not only warranted but owed to all of us 
after what we’ve been through this past year. 
We also heard testimony from Lisa 
Mensah, who leads the Opportunity Fi-
nance Network, which is the national

association of CDFIs, our mission lend-
ers. She warned us that ‘‘thousands of 
business owners will not receive access 
to PPP without an extension.’’ 
She told us about a CDFI in Jackson, 
MS, that estimates that 1,300 loans 
from small businesses that applied for 
PPP will not receive funds if we do not 
extend the deadline. Of these 1,300 ap-
plicants, 98 percent are businesses with 
fewer than 20 employees, 95 percent are 
minority-owned, and nearly 100 of them 
are veteran- or veteran-spouse-owned 
small businesses. 
This is only one CDFI out of hun-
dreds nationwide. The story will be re-
peated—those that have been left out. 
The committee has also been urged to 
extend the deadline by the business 
community. On March 15, more than 90 
chambers of commerce, trade groups, 
and business organizations sent a let-
ter urging extension, and they said: 
Nearly one year into the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the continued liquidity challenges of 
the small business sector are acute. 
It is clear that there is still an over-
whelming need for PPP loans, which is 
why the PPP Extension Act passed the 
House of Representatives by a 415-to-3 
vote. This is bipartisan. The bill that 
we are talking about is sponsored by 
Senator COLLINS. Senator SHAHEEN and 
I are also on that bill. 
The good news is that the resources 
are there. We have been informed by 
the SBA that the extension of the 
deadline can work within the funds 
that have already been made available 
by Congress. The money is there. 
This is not the first time we have 
done this. I must remind my colleagues 
that, last year, as PPP was approach-
ing its deadline, I brought a bill to the 
floor of the Senate and worked with 
Senator RUBIO to give small businesses 
more time to get their applications 
filed. I must also remind my colleagues 
that we passed that extension to pre-
serve access to PPP while we continued 
negotiating on broader changes to the 
program. We need to do the same thing 
again. 
I know that there are other modifica-
tions to the program that we will have 
an opportunity to discuss, and I am 
committed to conducting those discus-
sions in the same bipartisan manner 
that I have approached the develop-
ment of these programs. In fact, later 
today, in just 45 minutes, there will be 
a hearing of the Small Business Com-
mittee where we will be doing over-
sight on the programs that we made 
available during COVID–19, and we will 
have representatives from government 
responsible for those programs, includ-
ing the SBA. 
But the bottom line: We first need to 
extend the program. We have got to 
make sure it doesn’t expire next week. 
We must get this done. The need is 
there, and the funds are there. 
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
Mr. President, I rise to celebrate 
Women’s History Month and support 
S.J. Res. 1, legislation I introduced 
with my partner in this effort, Senator 
MURKOWSKI of Alaska. 
Our bipartisan legislation would re-
move the deadline for the States’ rati-
fication of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment, the ERA, and I am pleased that 
the House adopted the companion 
version of this legislation, H.J. Res. 17, 
last week. I now urge the Senate to 
take up and pass this legislation. 
Ratification of the ERA would ex-
pressly prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of sex in the U.S. Constitution. 
The amendment simply reads: 
Equality of rights under the law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any State on account of sex. 
In January 2020, Virginia became the 
38th State to ratify the ERA, which 
was first proposed in 1972. Congress has 
the authority under article V of the 
Constitution to set and change dead-
lines for the ratification of constitu-
tional amendments and has done so on 
numerous occasions. Recall that, in 
1992, the 27th amendment of the Con-
stitution, prohibiting immediate con-
gressional pay raises, was successfully 
ratified after 203 years. That amend-
ment was initially proposed as part of 
the original Bill of Rights in 1789. 
There should be no time limit on 
equality. Even as we celebrate Amer-
ica’s first female Vice President, our 
Nation is held back as the only modern 
Constitution that fails to enshrine full 
equality for both men and women. This 
is unacceptable. Most Americans are 
surprised to learn that the ERA is not 
already part of the U.S. Constitution. 
The States have done their job to make 
this happen. Now Congress must finally 
do its job and remove any legal obsta-
cle to certifying the ERA. 
Women were indeed left out of the 
Constitution 
intentionally 
by 
our 
Founding Fathers. American women, 
however, did demand equality as our 
country was being founded. In a letter 
in March 1776, Abigail Adams wrote to 
her husband John Adams, urging him 
and other members of the Continental 
Congress not to forget about the Na-
tion’s women. The future First Lady 
wrote, in part: 
I long to hear that you have declared an 
independence. And, by the way, in the new 
code of laws which I suppose it will be nec-
essary for you to make, I desire you would 
remember the ladies and be more generous 
and favorable to them than your ancestors. 
Do not put such unlimited power into of the 
hands of the husbands. Remember, all men 
would be tyrants if they could. If particular 
care and attention is not paid to the ladies, 
we are determined to foment a rebellion, and 
will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in 
which we have no voice or representation. 
Sadly, the Founding Fathers did not 
heed Abigail Adams’ call. Most nota-
bly, women were denied the right to 
vote for nearly 150 years. More broadly, 
women were treated as second-class 
citizens through our Nation’s history 
and were denied other basic and funda-
mental rights, such as being able to 
own property or work in their chosen 
occupation. 
Women comprise a majority of the 
underrepresented in government, elect-
ed office, the courts, and the business 
world. Without the ERA in the Con-
stitution, the statutes and case law 
that have produced major advances in 
women’s rights since the middle of the 
last century are vulnerable to being ig-
nored, weakened, or even reversed. 
Congress can amend or repeal anti- 
discrimination laws by a simple major-
ity. A new administration can fail to 
vigorously enforce civil rights statutes. 
The Supreme Court can use a lower 
standard of intermediate scrutiny to 
permit certain regressive forms of sex 
discrimination. 
Indeed, even today, women do not re-
ceive equal pay for equal work. The 
ERA would provide a needed constitu-
tional basis for legislation advancing 
women’s equality. Historically, the 
equal protection of the laws clause of 
the 14th Amendment has been used to 
fight discrimination on the basis of 
gender. However, without language in 
the Constitution specifically estab-
lishing that there shall be no denial or 
abridgement of rights on the basis of 
sex, the Supreme Court will likely con-
tinue to apply a lower level of scrutiny 
in cases related to discrimination 
against women. By contrast, the Su-
preme Court uses the ‘‘strict scrutiny’’ 
test in reviewing cases of racial and re-
ligious discrimination. 
As former Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia, a fervent originalist, 
once stated, ‘‘Certainly the Constitu-
tion does not require discrimination on 
the basis of sex. The only issue is 
whether it prohibits it. It doesn’t. 
Former Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg stated: 
Every constitution written since the end of 
World War II includes a provision that men 
and women are citizens of equal stature. 
Ours does not. . . . If I could choose an 
amendment to add to the Constitution, it 
would be the Equal Rights Amendment. I 
would like my granddaughters, when they 
pick up the Constitution, to see that no-
tion—that women and men are persons of 
equal stature—I’d like them to see that in a 
basic principle of our society. 
Public polling indicates that the 
country is ready for the ERA. Today, 
nearly 
half 
the 
States—including 
Maryland and Alaska—have a version 
of the ERA written into their State 
constitutions. In the era of ‘‘Me Too,’’ 
there has been a renewed energy for 
adopting the ERA, as society finally 
addresses the longstanding problems of 
violence and sexual harassment against 
women and demanding justice and ac-
countability. 
Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated 
International Women’s Day worldwide, 
on March 8, with the 2021 theme: 
‘‘Choose to Challenge.’’ It is now far 
past the time we bring the conversa-
tion of women’s equality and empower-
ment to center stage. 
The United States of America is one 
of the most developed, wealthiest, and 
admired countries in the world today, 
and immigrants from all over the world 
continue to travel to the United States 
to pursue their dreams and make a bet-
ter life for themselves and their fami-
lies. However, to this very day, the

S1733 
March 24, 2021 
Constitution of the United States, our 
Nation’s supreme law of the land, still 
does not declare that men and women 
are of equal stature. The passage of 
this historic amendment would truly 
never be more possible or needed as it 
is today. 
Let me quote from President Biden’s 
statement on the ERA, upon the House 
passage of this legislation last week: 
Gender equality is not only a moral issue. 
The full participation of women and girls 
across all aspects of our society is essential 
to our economic prosperity, our security, 
and the health of our democracy. This is es-
pecially critical right now, as the collision of 
a public health crisis, economic crisis, and 
caregiving crisis has erased decades of wom-
en’s economic gains and pushed more women 
out of the American workforce than we’ve 
seen in more than 30 years. 
President Biden concluded: 
It is long past time that we enshrine the 
principle of gender equality in our Constitu-
tion. 
Let me address one other issue re-
garding a recent decision on the ERA 
and the validity of the State ratifica-
tion under the previous congressional 
deadlines. In this case, decided by 
Judge Contreras in the United States 
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, it is just as important to dis-
cuss what the judge did not hold in his 
decision. Notably, the judge in this 
case wrote: 
Equally significant as the Court’s holding 
is what it does not hold. . . . Congress has 
not tried to revive the ERA despite both 
deadlines’ expirations, so the Court is not 
confronted with that difficult issue. . . . 
Lastly, the Court does not express an opin-
ion on the merits of the ERA as a matter of 
policy. It merely enforces a procedural time 
limit that Congress set when proposing the 
amendment. 
In my view, this decision makes the 
need for decisive congressional action 
clearer than ever on this procedural 
time limit, using the power of Congress 
under Article V of the Constitution. It 
is far past time for Congress to take up 
and pass this legislation that would re-
move the time limit for the ERA ratifi-
cation, which will remove any remain-
ing legal ambiguities about congres-
sional intent. Let us take up and pass 
this legislation without further delay, 
and finally write equality between men 
and women into our Constitution. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 80 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, it has be-
come all too easy for pundits and poli-
ticians to reduce the security of our 
borders to a bumper sticker or bill-
board slogan. 
As someone who appreciates the 
value of human life, as a survivor of 
sexual assault, and someone who cares 
deeply about the safety and security of 
women and children across the globe, I 
am horrified that we continue to put 
border security at the bottom of our 
policy to-do list. 
On January 31, 2016—the same day as 
her college graduation—Iowan Sarah 
Root was killed by an illegal immi-
grant named Edwin Mejia. He was drag 
racing, with a blood alcohol level more 
than three times the legal limit. 
Despite repeated requests by local 
law 
enforcement, 
Immigration 
and 
Customs Enforcement failed to detain 
Mejia because of a catch-and-release 
policy that ultimately allowed him to 
escape the country. Unfortunately, this 
is the same policy that President Biden 
supported during the Obama adminis-
tration. 
Still, more than 4 years later, Mejia 
remains a fugitive, denying Sarah’s 
loved ones any sense of justice or clo-
sure. After today, I will have now live 
UC’d this bill twice, and I expect the 
same thing to happen today as did last 
time; that it will be objected to by my 
Democratic colleagues. 
As a mother, I cannot fathom the 
grief that Sarah’s family, her mother 
and father Michelle and Scott, her 
brother, and her friends continue to 
feel after such a devastating loss. 
Sarah had her whole future in front 
of her, but her opportunity to make 
her mark on the world was tragically 
cut short. At the same time, while 
Sarah Root’s mother and father grieve, 
a child, without a parent, continues to 
make the perilous journey at the hands 
of a smuggler. Many arrive here dehy-
drated and malnourished and subject to 
unspeakable atrocities, from rape to 
assaults. 
Since Inauguration Day, we have 
seen record numbers of children at the 
border, a heartbreaking humanitarian 
crisis. Before then, the Migrant Protec-
tion Protocols, or the ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’ policy, was in place and helped 
keep migrants safely in Mexico until 
the United States had a chance to proc-
ess them. 
This policy singlehandedly reduced 
the need for bed space in the United 
States, protected migrants from that 
treacherous journey through Mexico, 
and kept our facilities from being dan-
gerously overcrowded. Border Patrol 
agents were able to return to their 
originally assigned duties of patrolling 
for drugs and human traffickers. 
But as we have heard time and again, 
and something that is very true, elec-
tions have consequences. President 
Biden, before he even had the chance to 
unpack, made serious changes to immi-
gration policies—changes that have re-
sulted in the national emergency at 
the U.S.-Mexico border. 
First, he rolled back the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy, and that is a big rea-
son why we have a crisis at the border 
today. Instead of keeping migrants in 
Mexico and deterring those from mak-
ing the dangerous journey north, the 
vacancy sign is on. But the reality is, 
we are out of space. 
It feels as if the Biden administration 
is starting to see the reality of the dis-
aster they created at our southern bor-
der. They are now walking this rever-
sal back and asking the Mexican Gov-
ernment to reinstate the previous ad-
ministration’s policy. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden signed an Executive order sus-
pending all domestic deportation pro-
ceedings. If Sarah Root’s story played 
out today, Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement would not pick up her 
killer, and the same tragedy could hap-
pen again and again. 
Although nothing can bring beautiful 
Sarah back to her family, we can en-
sure that the Federal Government 
never makes this mistake again. 
Today, I rise to call upon my Senate 
colleagues to help make that happen, 
to stop another tragedy like Sarah’s 
from happening with a simple and 
clean fix. I am asking the Senate to 
join myself and 22 of our colleagues and 
pass my bill, Sarah’s Law. 
Sarah’s Law is simple: It requires 
that ICE take custody of a person who 
is in the country illegally if they are 
charged with a crime that seriously in-
jures another person. It also mandates 
a better victim notification system 
that lets victims and their families— 
like the Root family—know what hap-
pened to their loved ones. 
Sarah’s Law is about as common-
sense an effort as there is. It recognizes 
the simple fact that all criminals 
should be held accountable for their ac-
tions—all criminals—and not simply 
allowed to slip back into the shadows. 
If Sarah’s Law is passed, people who 
are in this country illegally and mur-
der another person would be prioritized 
for deportation if released. 
Who could be opposed to this? 
In fact, a previous vote on this bill in 
the form of an amendment was sup-
ported by the majority of the Senate 
and was bipartisan. 
No family should ever have to endure 
such a tragedy, especially one that 
could have been prevented. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 80 and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Is there objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Iowa 
tells us a compelling story of Sarah 
Root, whose death at the hands of a 
drunk driver is a tragedy. However, I 
respectfully suggest this legislation is 
not the answer. 
This bill that she is proposing would 
require the mandatory detention of im-
migrants 
charged—not 
convicted— 
charged with certain crimes. The mere 
allegation of criminal conduct would 
result in months, possibly years, of de-
tention before case adjudication.

committed a crime, regardless of cir-
cumstances, violates a principle that is 
deeply embedded in the American legal 
system: innocent until proven guilty. 
Under this bill, someone wrongly ar-
rested wouldn’t be eligible for individ-
ualized bond determination. This is not 
consistent with the basic tenets of due 
process in our Constitution. 
Creating a new category of immi-
grants subject to indefinite detention 
for being charged also could be harmful 
to the survivors of domestic violence. 
Over 20 years ago, I was introduced to 
a group in Chicago. The name of the 
group—and I am sorry if I don’t pro-
nounce it correctly, pretty close—is 
Mujeres Latinas en Accion. This is a 
group that came together to try to pro-
tect undocumented mothers and wives 
from domestic abuse. The reason they 
came together was these poor women 
were being victimized and abused in 
ways unthinkable and were so afraid to 
report it to police because of their un-
documented status. So this group of 
women in the community came to-
gether and said: We have to build a 
shelter. These women had to get away 
from 
their 
abusive 
husbands 
who, 
many times, were also abusing the 
children. That is what happened. Today 
it is still there, and it is still needed. 
These survivors of domestic abuse, 
many times in desperation, would fi-
nally strike back at the abusive hus-
band, and some of them were even sub-
ject to arrest for assault against the 
abusing husband. Under the proposal 
today that is being suggested by the 
Senator from Iowa, that woman, hav-
ing been abused by that husband for so 
many years, finally striking back and 
assaulting 
the 
husband 
and 
being 
charged, would automatically be incar-
cerated. There wouldn’t be a judge to 
consider 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
cir-
cumstances in her life. 
Survivors of human trafficking, sex-
ual assault, and domestic violence are 
often at risk of arrest initially, but 
many 
times 
in 
court, 
the 
cir-
cumstances are explained, and a dif-
ferent conclusion is reached. 
In one study, nearly half of the incar-
cerated women in the study described 
assaults they had committed in their 
own defense. This bill has no exception 
for immigrants who are charged with 
crimes that resulted from their defend-
ing themselves against violence. 
Let me add, too, that this bill is not 
necessary. Our immigration laws give 
to ICE the authority to detain people 
who are deported. In fact, there are 
thousands of people detained, right 
now, using this authority. 
There is no question that our immi-
gration system is far from perfect and 
is a broken system. We have a responsi-
bility and we have authority in Con-
gress to reform our immigration law. 
If the Senator from Iowa is inter-
ested in working on bipartisan immi-
gration reform, I welcome the oppor-
tunity to ask her to join us to try to 
find pragmatic, bipartisan solutions. 
We had an initial meeting today, a bi-
partisan meeting of Senators, to open 
the conversation. But trying to pass 
this bill by unanimous consent is not 
the way to approach this very complex 
problem. We need to roll up our sleeves 
and say: Let’s, as Senators on a bipar-
tisan basis, do it. 
I stand ready to do so. I hope the 
Senator from Iowa does too. As tough 
as it may be, we need to tackle these 
issues and not ignore them as they 
were for the last 4 years under the pre-
vious Republican President. 
For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the comments of my col-
league, the Senator from Illinois, but 
there is no doubt that we have a prob-
lem in the United States today. Our 
immigration system does need to be re-
formed, but it does need to be done in 
a bipartisan manner. 
This, when presented as an amend-
ment on the floor of the Senate, was a 
bipartisan-supported amendment, and 
it deals with those who are charged 
with bodily injury of another person or 
of murder. That is what happened in 
Sarah’s case. 
ICE is given the opportunity to de-
tain an individual, but in this case, ICE 
chose not to, even though a young 
woman was murdered by a man oper-
ating under multiple assumed names 
with no familial ties in the area. The 
man was allowed to slip back into the 
shadows, and Sarah Root’s family will 
likely never ever see justice. 
So the pendulum swings both ways. I 
would much rather see Edwin Mejia 
face justice than allow the family of a 
young murdered woman to go without. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
we all know, over the last year, 
COVID–19 has taken center stage as the 
No. 1 public health crisis facing our Na-
tion. No community has been spared 
from the devastation caused by this 
virus, which has claimed more than 
540,000 American lives. 
But beneath the surface, the prob-
lems we were facing before the pan-
demic still exist, and, in many cases, 
they are getting worse. A year of 
stress, isolation, and loss has taken a 
serious 
toll 
on 
America’s 
mental 
health and has led to increasing rates 
of anxiety and depression. 
These same factors have led to an in-
crease in domestic violence as families 
have spent more time at home, often 
while battling the stress of job losses, 
financial difficulties, and virtual learn-
ing. 
And, of course, there is the opioid 
epidemic, which continues to destroy 
communities across our country. 
In 2019, there were more than 70,000 
overdose deaths in America—70,000. We 
are still waiting on the complete fig-
ures for 2020, but preliminary data 
shows that things are trending in the 
wrong direction. From June 2019 to 
May of 2020, more than 81,000 Ameri-
cans have died from overdoses. 
We know a significant portion of 
those deaths involve heroin—roughly 
20 percent of those who overdosed in 
2019. According to the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency’s ‘‘National Drug Threat 
Assessment,’’ the vast majority of that 
heroin comes from Mexico, a stag-
gering 92 percent. 
As we have discussed the crisis at the 
border, I have talked about ways the 
surge of unaccompanied children af-
fects Customs and Border Protection’s 
ability to carry out its other missions, 
including stopping the flow of these il-
legal drugs. Time spent processing and 
caring for children means less time on 
the frontlines catching or deterring the 
cartels 
from 
moving 
their 
poison 
across the border into the United 
States. 
A 
Bloomberg 
report 
last 
year 
brought another aspect of this epi-
demic to light: the fact that chemicals 
made in the United States by U.S. com-
panies were key ingredients in the 
manufacturing of heroin in Mexico. 
One of those companies is Avantor, a 
Fortune 500 company that supplies 
chemicals and lab materials and serv-
ices across a number of industries. 
Avantor produces millions of products, 
including 
everything 
from 
medical 
masks to high-quality chemicals for 
pharmaceuticals, to kits for science 
labs in schools. But the focus here is on 
one particular chemical—acetic anhy-
dride. 
This is an 18-liter jug of acetic anhy-
dride, and you can see Avantor’s name 
on the label. Avantor sells this through 
a subsidiary known as J.T. Baker into 
Mexico. Now, there are legitimate uses 
for acetic anhydride. It is used to make 
cigarette filters and chemicals used for 
photographic films, but this wasn’t a 
photo taken in a chemical lab or a 
manufacturing plant here in the United 
States. This was taken by a Bloomberg 
reporter in Mexico who was able to 
purchase this chemical online, no ques-
tions asked. This should have never 
happened. Why? Because acetic anhy-
dride is a highly regulated chemical, at 
least in the United States and, actu-
ally, around the world. Some compa-
nies even bar the importation of acetic 
anhydride because of its use in manu-
facturing illegal drugs. 
But the reason it is regulated is it is 
a precursor in the production of heroin. 
That is why many countries ban the 
importation outright. Without this 
chemical, it is virtually impossible to 
transform opium from a poppy seed 
into the more lethal drug of heroin. 
Acetic anhydride, as I said, is one of 
the most tightly controlled chemicals 
worldwide and has been for some time. 
The International Narcotics Control 
Board has been sounding the alarm on 
this dangerous chemical since the

2000s. In fact, its annual report has de-
scribed horrific examples of the dan-
gerous precursor chemical being di-
verted from legitimate uses to illegit-
imate uses, like making heroin. 
But the fact is, Mexico did not sign 
on 
to 
the 
International 
Narcotics 
Board 
protocol 
for this dangerous 
chemical until 2018, and even then, the 
enforcement, oversight, and control of 
this precursor was lax, at best. Even 
now, given the controls the cartels 
exert over large swaths of Mexico, I 
have no confidence that any controls 
on this chemical are effective in stop-
ping illicit uses in that country. 
The Bloomberg investigation brought 
to light how easy it was for the cartels 
to get hold of this chemical. The re-
porters were able to purchase this 18- 
liter jug online or at a medical supply 
store. It didn’t take any special re-
quirements. You can imagine how easy 
it was for the cartels to get their hands 
on this chemical. 
While the controls, oversight, and en-
forcement of this chemical are much 
tighter in the United States and have 
been for years, it presents a constant 
challenge when Mexico does not have 
the same standards and enforcement. 
It presents an additional hurdle for 
the safety of our communities when 
U.S. companies, like Avantor, avail 
themselves of foreign subsidiaries to 
create and manufacture the precursor 
chemical in a cartel’s own backyard, 
thereby facilitating the manufacture 
and sale of the deadly drug known as 
heroin. 
Of course, the winners in all of this 
are the cartels, in addition to their 
criminal network of smugglers, who 
move the drug across our border. The 
losers are our communities here in the 
United States and our loved ones who 
have been tragically affected by the 
opioid epidemic. 
This is an open-air drug lab in 
Sinaloa State, the home of El Chapo’s 
drug empire. Cartels can use this single 
jug of 18 liters of chemical to make 
heroin in this drug lab that is con-
cealed in a rural part of Mexico. They 
can make out of that one jug about 80 
pounds, or 90,000 hits, of heroin out of 
one jug. Of course, one hit is enough to 
destroy a life, but think of the pain 
that one 18-liter jug can inflict on an 
entire community, and Avantor knows 
that these jugs in this size can be eas-
ily concealed in something like the 
trunk of a car. 
One container of this chemical costs 
$324. The street value of the heroin 
that it will yield is at least $3.6 mil-
lion. One jug at $324 can produce $3.6 
million worth of street value in heroin. 
If this doesn’t make your blood boil, 
you are not paying attention. After all, 
it is simply impossible to believe that 
Avantor, which is a Fortune 500 com-
pany that is publicly traded here in 
America, was selling large quantities 
of this chemical—banned in many 
countries of the world because of its 
use in illegal drug manufacturing—and 
had no idea that it was being used for 
illicit purposes in Mexico. I don’t think 
anybody would believe they didn’t 
know. 
Bloomberg reports that this has been 
going on for at least the last 10 years, 
when photos like this surfaced of the 
J.T. Baker line of product showing up 
in drug busts by the Mexican authori-
ties. 
Unfortunately, the bad news doesn’t 
stop there. The nominee for the third 
highest ranking position at the Depart-
ment of Justice has profited to the 
tune 
of 
millions 
of 
dollars 
from 
Avantor stock. Vanita Gupta has been 
nominated to serve as the Associate 
Attorney General, and she is a very 
large shareholder in this publicly trad-
ed company. She owns millions of dol-
lars of Avantor stock, parked in her 
own accounts and in the various trusts 
she has identified in her financial dis-
closures. This isn’t just a blind invest-
ment in a mutual fund; this is the fam-
ily business. Ms. Gupta’s father is 
Avantor’s chairman of the board. 
Following Ms. Gupta’s confirmation 
hearing in the Judiciary Committee, 
Senators submitted questions for the 
record. One question was submitted by 
Senator GRASSLEY, the ranking mem-
ber. He asked Ms. Gupta if she were 
aware that Avantor was producing and 
selling chemical precursors used in the 
illegal heroin trade in Mexico. 
She said: 
I am aware of the allegations. 
The next question from Senator 
GRASSLEY was about her financial hold-
ings. Since she owns upwards of $55 
million in Avantor stock, he asked if 
she had profited financially from this 
chemical trade of acetic anhydride by 
Avantor in Mexico. 
Ms. Gupta said: 
As a shareholder with no role in Avantor, 
I am not able to say whether and how much 
I have profited from the various parts of 
Avantor’s business. 
I generally believe witnesses who tes-
tify under oath at Judiciary Com-
mittee hearings if there is no reason 
not to believe them, but it pains me to 
say that Ms. Gupta had already estab-
lished a clear pattern of deception or of 
flat-out lying during her confirmation 
process. 
Ms. Gupta wrote an op-ed piece in the 
HuffPost on November 4, 2012. At that 
time, she said that States should de-
criminalize 
the 
possession 
of 
all 
drugs—not 
just 
marijuana 
but 
all 
drugs—for personal use. 
In the article, she said: 
States should decriminalize simple posses-
sion of all drugs, particularly marijuana, and 
for small amounts of other drugs. 
That is a quotation. You can see that 
here. That would include decrimi-
nalizing fentanyl, methamphetamine, 
and other highly addictive, deadly 
drugs, including, of course, heroin. 
Well, that wasn’t her answer at her 
confirmation 
hearing. 
When 
asked 
whether she advocates for the decrimi-
nalization of all drugs, she didn’t 
mince words. 
She said: 
No, Senator. I do not. 
Now, I understand that it is natural 
for people to change their minds, espe-
cially in light of new information or 
new experiences. In Ms. Gupta’s case, 
she noted that her experience at the 
Department of Justice and with addic-
tion in her own family had led her to 
evolve her position on these issues. 
Yet, in responding to Senator GRASS-
LEY’s written questions, she wrote: 
I have never advocated for the decrimi-
nalization of all drugs, and I do not support 
the decriminalization of all drugs. 
That is demonstrably false. It is not 
true. She obviously held the view and 
felt so strongly about it at the time 
that she penned an op-ed piece in a na-
tional publication to advocate for the 
decriminalization of all drugs. 
When a person has been nominated 
for a leadership position at the Depart-
ment of Justice, that person has a duty 
to be honest and forthright. If you have 
learned any new information and have 
changed your mind, that is fine, but 
you can’t flat-out mislead about not 
having held beliefs that you clearly 
held in the past, especially when those 
beliefs could interfere with your abil-
ity to do the very job for which you 
have been nominated. 
It is not just with decriminalization 
that Ms. Gupta has misled the Judici-
ary Committee. As to qualified immu-
nity, defunding the police, and the 
death penalty, Ms. Gupta has offered 
misleading statements on each of these 
issues. Policy differences, I can accept, 
but a lack of candor is disqualifying, 
especially for the Office of the Asso-
ciate Attorney General. 
So when Ms. Gupta said she was un-
aware that Avantor was profiting or 
that she was profiting from the illicit 
manufacturing of heroin in Mexico, I 
do not find that credible. It is just an-
other example of saying whatever you 
need to say to get confirmed by the 
Senate. 
The Department of Justice is the 
highest law enforcement Agency in the 
country, and Ms. Gupta has been nomi-
nated to serve as third in command. If 
confirmed, she will oversee the Civil 
Division, which will make major deci-
sions about who will be investigated, 
who will be charged, and who will face 
punishment. Some of those potential 
targets include opioid companies, drug 
manufacturers, or perhaps even compa-
nies 
that 
are 
diverting 
precursor 
chemicals to the cartels. If you look at 
the work at the moment of the Civil 
Division of the Department of Justice, 
you will see a number of civil actions 
already related to the diversion of 
opioids and companies involved in ille-
gal schemes. What does this say about 
her ability to supervise those kinds of 
cases? 
The 
Department 
requires 
profes-
sional detachment from even the ap-
pearance of impropriety, and this con-
flict of interest of Ms. Gupta’s goes far 
beyond simple appearance. Ms. Gupta 
has financially benefited from the sale 
of this chemical to cartels in Mexico.

She has financially benefited whether 
she knew it at the time or not, but she 
won’t even admit it. As a result, any 
case that has a nexus to drugs brought 
by the Department of Justice while she 
is at the helm will have a giant cloud 
cast over it. 
Finally, what I find most troubling, 
in addition to her lack of candor, is 
that Ms. Gupta has shown absolutely 
no remorse for the harm done by 
Avantor in facilitating the manufac-
ture and sale of heroin here in the 
United States. I estimate that, in the 
last 10 years, more than 100,000 Ameri-
cans have died of drug overdoses asso-
ciated with heroin. So I cannot support 
the nomination of Ms. Gupta to serve 
as Associate Attorney General, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to oppose her 
nomination as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 903 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last month alone, more than 
100,000 migrants crossed our southern 
border. Our ports of entry are overrun; 
holding facilities are packed; and, yes, 
our Border Patrol agents are abso-
lutely exhausted. They are exhausted. 
This isn’t just a logistical challenge; it 
is a tragedy made worse by the Biden 
administration’s disastrous open bor-
ders policies. 
The crisis is escalating, especially for 
the tens of thousands of children who 
have arrived in this country very much 
alone. 
Unaccompanied 
minors 
ac-
counted for nearly 10 percent of all mi-
grants who crossed our border last 
month. That is roughly 10,000 children 
a month walking into chaos. 
Anyone paying a bit of attention 
knows what is going on here. Customs 
and Border Protection has been sound-
ing the alarm on the connection be-
tween children and human trafficking 
for years. The coyotes, the cartels, and 
the gangs use children as drug mules. 
They use them as sex slaves. If you 
don’t believe me, ask anyone with the 
CBP why they administer pregnancy 
tests to little girls as young as 13 as 
soon as they arrive at the border. 
This is a heartbreaking situation. 
These children are living in hell, and it 
is getting worse. False claims of family 
ties have fueled a rise in fraudulent 
asylum claims and in human traf-
ficking. Adult migrants are making ar-
rangements with cartels and smugglers 
to borrow children. They claim kinship 
and use that relationship to bolster a 
fraudulent asylum claim. And what do 
they do when they have gotten what 
they want? They send the child back 
across the border to start the entire 
nightmarish 
process 
with 
another 
stranger. That is correct. This is called 
child recycling, but I think ‘‘recycling’’ 
is an odd choice of words to describe 
one human being treating another 
human being like a piece of garbage. 
Again, this is heartbreaking. 
If you want to get an idea of how big 
a problem we have, consider that the 
Department of Homeland Security says 
that, over the past decade, they have 
seen a 1,675-percent increase in asylum 
cases. 
In 2019, Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement implemented a pilot DNA 
testing program to try to stop this 
rampant exploitation. They found that 
20 percent of all kinship claims they 
were able to screen were lies—20 per-
cent. 
This is a humanitarian crisis, an en-
vironmental crisis, and a health and 
safety crisis. The Biden administration 
has lost control of this situation, but 
there are things we can do right now to 
protect these children and put the 
smugglers in check. 
This week, I introduced the End 
Child Trafficking Now Act, which 
would require our border agents to ad-
minister DNA tests to adult migrants 
claiming kinship with a minor without 
migrants’ having the legal documenta-
tion to prove it. 
If the adult refuses, they will be im-
mediately deported. Furthermore, the 
bill mandates a 10-year penalty for all 
alien adults who lie about their rela-
tionship with a minor. 
The test is simple. It takes about 90 
minutes. Ninety minutes could mean 
the difference between that child find-
ing safety in the United States and 
that child being dragged back to a car-
tel. 
We are on pace to see 17,000 more un-
accompanied minors arrive this month. 
ICE proved this testing strategy can 
help protect them. There is no valid, 
fact-based reason not to do it. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 903 and 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. Further, I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Reserving the right to 
object, Madam President, I share my 
colleague’s desire to prevent child traf-
ficking. Trust me, as a parent, I know 
it is a laudable goal. But as drafted—as 
drafted—this bill would create enor-
mous and instant chaos at airports 
around the country and every other 
port of entry. 
As written, it would require every 
foreign family who seeks admission to 
the United States, even just for a fam-
ily vacation, to have a third party wit-
ness a test to their affiliation or else 
submit to a DNA test. I can’t imagine 
any of our airports have the resources 
to implement this. It would simply 
lead to the same chaos we saw after the 
implementation of President Trump’s 
Muslim ban, or worse, it would over-
whelm our law enforcement officials 
and create bottlenecks at customs for 
citizens and noncitizens alike, not to 
mention the many legal and ethical 
questions as it pertains to genetic pri-
vacy and the storage of that informa-
tion. 
I would be more than happy to sit 
down with my colleague from Ten-
nessee in the context of a larger discus-
sion about immigration reform to see 
how we can ensure that we include pro-
visions to prevent child trafficking, but 
I don’t think this bill as drafted will 
actually accomplish that goal, and so I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I think my colleague understands 
that this bill would apply to individ-
uals, to adults who cannot show kin-
ship and do not have legal documenta-
tion. 
We know that human trafficking, sex 
trafficking, and child trafficking have 
become a major industry. We know 
that child recycling is a practice that 
is used by the cartels. We know that 
they are using this to move adults into 
the country; thereby, this is something 
that would put the cartels in check and 
show that we are not going to stand for 
them recycling children, claiming kin-
ship to children who are not theirs, and 
trying to move drug smugglers and car-
tel members into this country. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 890 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to bring attention to the serious 
humanitarian crisis at our southern 
border. Right now, as we speak, thou-
sands of children have entered the 
United States illegally and sit in 
crowded detention centers wrapped up 
in emergency blankets, hundreds, even 
thousands, of miles away from home. 
They are without their families and 
without their parents. Many of them 
have been trafficked and have been 
physically and sexually abused along 
the way. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
reported that just last month alone, 
29,792 unaccompanied children came 
across our border, including 2,942 chil-
dren under the age of 12. All of these 
children came here without their par-
ents, and they have come here in large 
numbers because they know that Presi-
dent Biden is promising them amnesty. 
The 
illegal 
immigrants 
coming 
across our southern border right now 
are not just children. President Biden’s 
Secretary 
of 
Homeland 
Security, 
Alejandro Mayorkas, has said: ‘‘We are 
on pace to encounter more individuals 
on the southwest border than we have 
in the last 20 years.’’ 
In February, more than 100,000 illegal 
immigrants came across our southern

border, according to the U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection, which is 3 times 
the number of illegal immigrants who 
came through the southern border in 
February of 2019, and it is almost 6 
times the number of illegal immigrants 
who came through our southern border 
in February of 2018. 
The Biden administration refuses to 
call this a crisis, but that is what it is. 
We have a humanitarian crisis, and we 
also have a security crisis. 
Of the over 100,000 illegal immigrants 
who came here in February, 71 percent 
of them are single adults, according to 
the Pew Research Center. 
The Biden administration’s policy 
has been to welcome these illegal im-
migrants and to halt or slow deporta-
tions as much as possible. When Joe 
Biden became President, he imme-
diately halted construction of the bor-
der wall. He ended the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy, an incredible foreign 
policy victory President Trump nego-
tiated with Mexico, which stipulated 
that illegal immigrants from Central 
America 
crossing 
illegally 
through 
Mexico to seek asylum in the United 
States would stay in Mexico during the 
pendency of their proceedings. Presi-
dent Biden ended that, ripping apart 
that international agreement, and, in-
stead, he reinstated the failed policy of 
catch-and-release. 
So now when we apprehend illegal 
immigrants, we let them go, including 
illegal immigrants who are criminals 
and who are convicted criminals guilty 
of violent crimes. President Biden’s po-
litical decisions have produced a crisis 
and a crisis that is growing. 
What the Biden administration has 
made clear in the last 2 months is that 
their priority is illegal immigrants and 
not American citizens. That is why, in 
just a moment, I am going to propound 
a unanimous consent request that the 
Senate pass Kate’s Law. Kate’s Law is 
named for Kate Steinle, who was 32 
years old when she was tragically 
killed on a San Francisco peer by an il-
legal immigrant who had several fel-
ony convictions and had been deported 
from the United States not once, not 
twice, not three times, not even four 
times. He had been deported five times. 
By the revolving door of our border, 
this violent criminal kept being de-
ported, and he kept coming back, and 
he kept coming back, and he kept com-
ing back. And beautiful Kate Steinle 
was shot and killed because of our bro-
ken immigration system. 
Kate’s Law is commonsense legisla-
tion. It would amend Federal law to 
impose a mandatory minimum sen-
tence of 5 years for any illegal reentry 
offense. Kate’s Law is critical to ensur-
ing that illegal immigrants who have 
been deported, especially those with 
violent criminal records, are deterred 
from repeatedly entering the country 
illegally over and over and over again. 
If the illegal immigrant, violent crimi-
nal who killed Kate Steinle had been in 
prison for illegally entering the United 
States the fifth time, Kate would still 
be here today. 
I have had the opportunity to meet 
Kate Steinle’s family. They don’t un-
derstand why our system is broken. 
They don’t understand why we keep 
letting in violent, criminal, illegal 
aliens over and over and over again. 
And I will tell you, the American peo-
ple—roughly 80 percent of Americans— 
agree with Kate’s Law. This is com-
monsense legislation. 
We are about to see a Democrat ob-
ject to it because today’s Democratic 
Party doesn’t care what the American 
people say. But if this were in the 
realm of sanity, Kate’s Law would pass 
100 to nothing. Look, we can have dis-
agreements about legal immigration, 
about what the rules are, but when it 
comes to violent, criminal, illegal 
aliens who enter the country illegally 
over and over and over again, it ought 
to be real simple. We ought to be able 
to come together as Democrats and Re-
publicans and say: All right, let’s draw 
the line there. We don’t need more 
murderers in America. 
I have spent a lot of time down in the 
valley and at the Texas border. I have 
spent a lot of time with agents from 
the Border Patrol. Tomorrow, I am 
going back to the border to see for my-
self what the conditions are like right 
now. I am leading a delegation of 17 
other Senators, and we are going to go 
talk to Customs and Border Patrol 
agents. We are going to meet with CBP 
leadership. We are going to meet with 
law enforcement and community lead-
ers. We are going to tour the detention 
facilities directly. 
Now, you may not see that on TV be-
cause the Biden administration is re-
fusing to allow the press to see the fa-
cilities. For 4 years, Democrats went 
on and on and on about kids in cages. 
Now, those cages were built by Barack 
Obama, and they are bigger and fuller 
under Joe Biden. And the Biden admin-
istration doesn’t want you to see the 
Biden cages. So they have declared a 
media blackout, that reporters are not 
allowed. 
The Trump administration allowed 
the media to go to the border. The 
Obama 
administration 
allowed 
the 
media to go to the border. The Bill 
Clinton administration allowed the 
media to go to the border. The George 
W. Bush administration allowed the 
media to go to the border. But Joe 
Biden wants to cover up the crisis that 
his administration has created, and it 
is a crisis that, sadly, Senate Demo-
crats are complicit in creating as well. 
We have yet to have a single Senate 
Democrat willing to break with the 
Biden administration on the unfolding 
humanitarian crisis on the border. The 
worse it gets, the more kids who are 
abused, the more kids who are as-
saulted, the more Americans who are 
put at risk of COVID, and the more 
Americans who are put at risk of vio-
lent crime. At some point, I hope and 
pray we will see Senate Democrats 
willing to say: Enough is enough. It is 
time to stop being angry partisans, and 
it is time to come together with com-
mon sense and protect the American 
citizens. 
For that reason, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 890, and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; further, I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam President, there 
is not a single Democratic Senator in 
this body who believes that someone 
who commits a violent crime should 
not feel the full weight of the U.S. judi-
cial system for their crimes. I hope my 
friend from Texas would agree with 
that. I don’t think there is a Member 
in this body—Democratic, Republican, 
Independent, the staff—not a one. I 
think the same holds true for our col-
leagues who work just down the cor-
ridor from us in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Now, we must do everything in our 
power to make certain that those en-
gaged in violent crimes face prosecu-
tion and feel the full weight of the law. 
That is not just bipartisan; that is the 
right thing to do. 
Where I disagree with my colleague 
is the assertion that immigrants are 
inherently criminal. They are not. 
They are people whom our kids go to 
school with, whom we work with, who 
grow our food in America, who work to 
prepare that food or even stock the 
shelves, teach in classrooms, serve in 
the U.S. military defending our free-
doms in the United States of America. 
So to my friend from Texas, this 
seems to be a continuance of the harm-
ful proposals from the Trump adminis-
tration. I certainly think that many of 
my colleagues from the other side of 
the aisle in the U.S. Senate also dis-
agree with the hateful pronouncements 
from Steve Miller. This feels like a 
continuance of that, to strike fear in 
Americans and to breed distrust in im-
migrants. 
Now, I agree with my colleague that 
we have to work together to stop that 
false narrative. This false narrative 
must stop because it is not contrib-
uting to fixing the broken immigration 
system we have in the United States. 
I agree with my colleague that we 
should come together and work in a bi-
partisan way to learn from one an-
other. I am new to this Chamber, but I 
am not new to these challenges. 
I certainly hope that my colleagues 
who are traveling to the border—and I 
commend them for doing so because 
this is an important conversation we 
should be having. I hope they travel to 
Matamoros. I don’t know if my col-
league from Texas has done that. I did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1738 
March 24, 2021 
I traveled down there with a group of 
colleagues. We had a chance to visit 
with the Border Patrol in El Paso. We 
had a chance to visit with Border Pa-
trol in Antelope Wells in New Mexico 
and Lordsburg in New Mexico. We have 
had the honor of traveling down into 
the 
Rio 
Grande 
Valley, 
down 
to 
Brownsville. We had a chance to visit 
with folks on the frontlines, not just 
wearing the green uniform of our Bor-
der Patrol and those working with the 
Department of Homeland Security but 
those who are also providing humani-
tarian relief. 
Those camps in Matamoros that I 
went to, they still exist. And one of the 
questions that needs to be asked is, 
What are these kids going through? 
What are they thinking about to travel 
thousands of miles because of the con-
cerns that they have for their own 
health and well-being? I hope we can 
have that conversation and solve this 
problem. So let’s find a way to work 
together. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: We need to go after criminals 
and felons, not children and families. 
In truth, I think we can get there. 
So as I close, I just say: Let’s be a 
beacon of hope to the most vulnerable. 
Let’s make sure we go after these 
criminals and felons, wherever they 
may be, and they feel the full weight of 
the law. But when it comes to the bro-
ken immigration system in America, 
let’s work together to fix it. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I appre-
ciate the warm sentiments of the Sen-
ator from New Mexico, but the Amer-
ican people can distinguish the dif-
ference between talk and action. 
The Senator from New Mexico sug-
gested that all Democrats support 
holding criminals to account. I would 
suggest the facts are precisely to the 
contrary. 
Just 2 weeks ago, on the floor of this 
body, we introduced an amendment to 
provide that $1,400 government stim-
ulus checks should not go to criminals 
currently in prison. Every single Sen-
ate Democrat voted against that. That 
amendment failed by one vote. If even 
one Democrat had said ‘‘OK, that is 
reasonable,’’ it would have passed. 
Yesterday, 
I 
introduced 
multiple 
unanimous consent requests to stop 
money from going to convicted crimi-
nals in prison and to send the money 
instead to the Crime Victims Fund. A 
Democrat objected. 
I then said: All right, if you don’t 
want to do all criminals, how about 
murderers? Can we agree, if you were 
convicted of homicide, if you killed 
somebody, let’s not send you a govern-
ment check; let’s send it to the Crime 
Victims Fund? The Democrats ob-
jected. 
I said: All right, how about rapists? 
The Democrats objected. 
I said: How about child molesters? 
Surely, we can all agree child molest-
ers are not worthy of a $1,400 taxpayer 
government bonus given by the Demo-
crats. The Democrats objected. 
So with all due respect to my friend 
from New Mexico, it is not the case 
that Democrats support holding pris-
oners to account. 
Today, in the Rules Committee, the 
Democrats are pushing forward an elec-
tion bill, the Corrupt Politicians Act, 
which would allow every felon in Amer-
ica who has been released from prison 
to vote. It would allow murderers to 
vote, rapists to vote, child molesters to 
vote. So it is not the case that Demo-
crats are willing to stand up to violent 
crime. 
Now, there are a couple of things 
that the Senator from New Mexico said 
that I wrote down. He said the only 
thing he disagreed with was ‘‘the asser-
tion that immigrants are inherently 
criminal.’’ Well, I challenge anyone 
watching this exchange to read the 
transcript. 
I am glad he disagrees with that as-
sertion. That assertion never came 
from my mouth. I am the son of an im-
migrant who came from Cuba. We are a 
nation of immigrants. I am not re-
motely asserting that immigrants are 
inherently criminal. There is a right 
way to come, and that is to come le-
gally. 
But case law isn’t about immigrants 
generally; it only applies to criminals. 
It is immigrants that have a criminal 
conviction, that have an aggravated 
felony conviction. So when my friend 
from New Mexico says that we need to 
focus on felons—and he closed his re-
marks with the following: ‘‘We need to 
go after criminals and felons, not chil-
dren and families’’—the case law does 
exactly that. 
If the Senator from New Mexico be-
lieves the words he said, the next words 
out of his mouth would not have been 
‘‘I object.’’ By virtue of objecting, he 
prevented us from, in a bipartisan way, 
going after criminals and felons. Case 
law is targeted at those criminals and 
felons. It is not targeted at kids; it is 
targeted at criminals and felons. 
I would ask the Senator from New 
Mexico and every Senate Democrat: 
What would you say to Kate Steinle’s 
family? I have heard them testify in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. I 
have visited with them personally. If 
you were looking them in the eyes, 
what would you say to a system where 
Kate Steinle’s murderer was deported 
five times—multiple criminal convic-
tions? 
I am the original author of Kate’s 
Law. We have voted on this on the Sen-
ate floor multiple times. Every time 
we have voted, every single Democratic 
Senator has voted against Kate’s Law. 
You don’t get to vote against Kate’s 
Law, you don’t get to vote against 
stopping violent criminals from repeat-
edly entering the country illegally, and 
then claim you are against violent 
criminals 
repeatedly 
entering 
the 
country illegally. 
Actions mean more than words, and, 
unfortunately, the actions of today’s 
Democratic Party are extreme and out 
of touch with the American people we 
were elected to represent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 948 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to discuss another 
issue in the Democrats’ massive COVID 
spending bill that we need to fix. 
My Democratic colleagues want to 
keep spending into oblivion, taking our 
national debt to $30 trillion. This 
would be bad enough on its own, but 
tucked into the bloated spending pack-
age were new tax hikes on self-em-
ployed individuals. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
didn’t talk about it, and they certainly 
aren’t talking about it as they travel 
the Nation to brag about their bad bill. 
Democrats are quietly raising taxes, 
hoping the American people don’t no-
tice. The $1.9 trillion so-called Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act, of which less 
than 10 percent went to actually help 
fight COVID and 1 percent to vaccines, 
had several tax increases and burden-
some reporting requirements, includ-
ing one that significantly impacts the 
gig workers—those who have been se-
verely impacted by the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Starting in 2022, this bill requires 
many contractors with gig economy 
companies 
like 
Uber, 
DoorDash, 
Airbnb, and Lyft to file 1099 forms 
when they previously would not have. 
The 
new 
requirement 
dramatically 
lowers 
the 
annual 
1099 
reporting 
threshold from $20,000 and 200 trans-
actions to just $600 and eliminates the 
transaction minimum. 
In late February, before the Demo-
crats 
rushed 
their 
spending 
bill 
through Congress on a purely partisan 
basis, a coalition of groups wrote to 
Speaker PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER, 
asking that this onerous new provision, 
which has nothing to do with address-
ing the coronavirus crisis, be removed 
or at least reconsidered. The letter was 
signed by groups such as the Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Coun-
cil, 
the 
National 
Asian 
American 
Chamber of Commerce, National Asso-
ciation for the Self-Employed, United 
States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, 
and the National Association of Women 
Business Owners. 
After receiving such a letter, one 
would think that Democrats would 
want to reconsider. Raising taxes and 
reporting requirements in the midst of 
a pandemic? This is never good policy, 
but I can’t think of any worse timing. 
Of course, Democrats kept the provi-
sion buried deep within the bill, hoping 
the American public wouldn’t notice. 
The Democrats’ new reporting re-
quirements are effectively a tax hike 
and will ultimately hurt low- and mid-
dle-income contractors, the self-em-
ployed, and freelancers, many of whom 
have been devastated by the pandemic,

while Federal and State Governments 
will collect billions more in income tax 
revenue. 
My Democratic colleagues want the 
American public to believe this is 
about catching tax cheats. And, to be 
clear, any attempt to evade taxes and 
defraud the public by not following the 
law should be condemned, and Congress 
should appropriately address it. How-
ever, a massive new reporting require-
ment of gig workers, many just trying 
to make ends meet in the midst of this 
pandemic, is not about catching tax 
fraud. It is about punishing the self- 
employed and raising revenues for the 
Democrats’ massive spending plans. 
It wasn’t that long ago that Presi-
dent Biden promised that he wouldn’t 
raise taxes on anyone making under 
$400,000. Obviously, that was not true. 
But this isn’t the first time Democrats 
have tried to quietly increase taxes and 
saddle the self-employed with new re-
quirements like this. They did it with 
ObamaCare when they required busi-
nesses to send 1099 forms for all pur-
chases of goods and services over $600 
annually. They quickly learned how 
unpopular and harmful this provision 
was, and they quickly repealed it. The 
Obama administration even praised the 
repeal as a ‘‘big win’’ for the self-em-
ployed. I guess some never learn. 
What I am proposing is very simple. 
It is what the Democrats supported in 
2011 when they repealed this bad tax in-
crease in ObamaCare. 
Today, I want to remove this new re-
porting requirement and simply rein-
state the previous law back into U.S. 
code. 
Increasing reporting requirements on 
our gig workers will create new and un-
expected challenges for independent, 
self-employed 
workers 
and 
entre-
preneurs, who are already facing an in-
credible 
burden 
created 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
Increasing costs and regulations on 
already struggling Americans is wrong, 
and I hope all of my colleagues will 
join me today and repeal this bad pol-
icy. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of S. 948, introduced ear-
lier today. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the 
Senator from Florida claims to be 
looking out for gig workers and free-
lancers. The reality is very different. 
What is in the bill, which the Senator 
from Florida apparently opposes, is a 
way to make sure that these workers 
can get the information they need to 
help meet their existing tax obliga-
tions. Without this information, for ex-
ample, workers may lose out on bene-
fits that would help them pay rent and 
buy groceries. They could inadvert-
ently lose out on important tax bene-
fits, like the earned income tax credit. 
The rescue plan, of course, expands the 
earned tax credit. We want to make 
sure that every eligible worker can get 
that financial help. 
Finally, without reporting, workers 
might jeopardize the size of their fu-
ture Social Security benefits, putting 
their retirement security at risk. 
So what the Senator from Florida is 
up to here would deprive American en-
trepreneurs of the information they 
need to keep business records, comply 
with tax requirements, and claim im-
portant Federal benefits. For these rea-
sons, I strongly object to this request 
for unanimous consent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, that sounded good, but this is 
clearly a tax increase. It is a massive 
tax increase, and it is a massive new 
reporting 
requirement 
on 
already 
struggling Americans. Our focus ought 
to be on helping support American 
workers, especially these gig economy 
workers who have been hurt so badly. 
I 
am 
disappointed 
my 
colleague 
wants to increase costs and regulations 
on American families. What is strange 
is that my colleague from Oregon voted 
to repeal this bad provision when 
Democrats added it to ObamaCare. So 
what is crazy is, why is he OK today 
with raising taxes on the American 
people now? This is all part of the 
Democrats’ tax-and-spend agenda, and 
it is just the beginning. 
Let’s remember, with the last spend-
ing bill the Democrats passed, we will 
have $30 trillion of debt. As Governor 
of Florida, I worked so that we cut 
taxes 100 times, and we paid off a third 
of our State debt. 
We have to think that way here. How 
can we grow this economy and reduce 
the costs for Americans, not increase 
the costs to Americans? These bad 
types of policies will ruin our economy 
and a shot at the American dream, 
which we all believe in. 
I am going to fight every day to get 
the government out of the way and 
make sure that doesn’t happen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at the conclu-
sion of my remarks, I be allowed to 
present an excerpt of my speech in 
Spanish. I will provide transcripts both 
in English and in Spanish of those 
paragraphs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 884 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I have 
read the accounts and so have many of 
you. A young mother from Honduras, 
two young sisters from Guatemala, a 6- 
year-old child from El Salvador—they 
were all told by a local cartel that, for 
a price, a better life awaits them in 
America. 
They are told, as evidenced by those 
chanting ‘‘Biden, Biden’’ at the border, 
that this new President has opened the 
borders and that amnesty is imminent, 
so get in while you can. 
These vulnerable people are flocking 
to smugglers and violent criminals and 
paying them all that they have for 
their chance to get in while they can. 
In the last month, traffickers have al-
legedly made as much as $14 million a 
week smuggling men, women, and chil-
dren across the border. 
Once indebted to cartels and coyotes, 
the price these vulnerable people pay is 
far more costly than money. According 
to media reports, men are used as 
slaves; women are raped endlessly. In 
fact, one-third of the women making 
their way to the border are reportedly 
sexually assaulted, and 68 percent of 
the people coming across the border 
are physically assaulted. 
Children are rented, trafficked, and 
‘‘recycled,’’ as they put it, forced to 
pose as the child of one illegal immi-
grant after another to activate the so- 
called Flores get-out-of-jail-free card. 
One former Border Patrol agent told 
me that the smugglers prefer to use ba-
bies because they are unable to tell 
Border Patrol agents that these are 
not, in fact, their parents. 
What of those who escape the clutch-
es of the cartels? Well, estimates of 
how many children are currently in 
Customs and Border Patrol custody 
vary from more than 4,000 children to 
well over 15,000. Thousands of these 
children are being held, packed into 
housing facilities, for well over the 72- 
hour limit required by Flores—and 
with no end in sight. 
The Biden administration is doing all 
it can to hide the humanitarian crisis 
created by its own immigration poli-
cies—a 
disaster 
that 
Secretary 
Mayorkas refuses to acknowledge as a 
crisis. It denied media access and ap-
pears to be enforcing an unofficial gag 
order on Border Patrol agents. Jour-
nalists have not been permitted inside 
the detention facilities since President 
Biden took office. 
Now, it shouldn’t be a surprise to any 
of us that the Biden administration’s 
open border policies have resulted in 
this overwhelming crisis—and a crisis 
it is. This is what then-Candidate 
Biden promised us in the very first

S1740 
March 24, 2021 
Democratic Presidential primary de-
bate. He promised us that when he be-
came President, there would be imme-
diate surges along the border. Unfortu-
nately, in this case, he has delivered 
exactly what he promised. How exactly 
did he deliver? Well, first, he made it 
known that once he was elected, the 
border would be open for business. 
Then he reversed course on a number of 
Trump-era commonsense immigration 
policies. This incentivized vulnerable 
people to entrust their lives and the 
lives of their children to dangerous 
coyotes and cartels. 
What are these policies? The safe 
third country policy, implemented by 
the Trump administration, requires 
asylum seekers to apply for asylum in 
the first safe country in which they ar-
rive. President Biden has moved to re-
peal that rule. 
The expansion of the Flores Settle-
ment agreement also creates perverse 
incentives in our immigration law. 
Flores is about protecting children, 
and yet, in the application of the ex-
pansion, we have put children in even 
greater danger of becoming victims of 
trafficking and cartel manipulation. 
The Biden policy of keeping all unac-
companied alien minors in the United 
States, as my fellow Senator from 
Utah 
has 
pointed 
out, 
actually 
incentivizes parents to separate them-
selves from their children by entrust-
ing their children to a cartel or coyote 
to bring them to the United States for 
their chance at amnesty. 
By moving to loosen the require-
ments of asylum and expand its appli-
cation, President Biden has invited im-
migrants, who could find safety in 
other regions of their own country or 
an adjacent country, to make the dan-
gerous journey to the United States. 
What we need are clear requirements 
to preserve the opportunities for asy-
lum for those who need it the most. 
America is the land to which those 
seeking a better life look for relief, and 
we should provide relief where we can. 
We also have a duty to protect our bor-
der, our citizens, and our laws, our na-
tional interests. At the very least, we 
have a duty to eliminate policies that 
empower cartels and coyotes to exploit 
women and children. We must stop 
incentivizing 
vulnerable 
people 
to 
make a journey that will very rarely 
lead to the outcome they desire. 
To this end, and together with Con-
gressman ANDY BIGGS and several of 
my fellow Senators, I have introduced 
the Stopping Border Surges Act to ad-
dress some of the more egregious loop-
holes in our immigration laws. 
This bill remedies the expansion of 
the Flores Settlement agreement that 
puts so many children in danger by re-
quiring the release of minors with any 
adult claiming to be the child’s parent. 
It provides expedited processing for un-
accompanied minors from all coun-
tries—processes 
currently 
available 
only to children from Mexico and Can-
ada. Immediate processing will blunt 
the incentive for parents to send their 
children on this dangerous journey 
alone. In an effort to end the traf-
ficking 
of 
children 
by 
cartels, 
it 
strengthens protections for children re-
leased to adults within the United 
States. It tightens the asylum process 
so that we can better serve those who 
genuinely need the protections we can 
offer, and it incentivizes immigrants to 
enter our country through official 
ports of entry. 
This bill offers a new commonsense 
series of reforms that will help stem 
the flood of immigrants at our border 
and free vulnerable women and chil-
dren from the clutches of the cartels 
and of the coyotes. For that reason, I 
urge all of my colleagues to support it, 
to join it, and to vote for it. 
Now, having previously received con-
sent, I would like to conclude these re-
marks in Spanish, remarks directed 
specifically to those who might be con-
sidering making the dangerous, per-
ilous journey to the southern border of 
the United States before sending their 
families. 
(The English translation of the state-
ment made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Please do not send your wives and daugh-
ters on this journey only to be sexually as-
saulted by the coyotes and cartels. We hear 
story after story of smugglers kidnapping 
women and children and holding them hos-
tage even after they cross our border. In the 
year 2019, the New York Times documented 
dozens of cases of these women. This is just 
one of those stories involving Melvin, a 36- 
year old mother of three from Guatemala: 
For weeks in that locked room, the men 
she had paid to get her safely to the United 
States drugged her with pills and cocaine, re-
fusing to let her out even to bathe. ‘‘I think 
that since they put me in that room, they 
killed me,’’ she said. ‘‘They raped us so many 
times they didn’t see us as human beings 
anymore.’’ 
Please, listen to Melvin’s story. Do not 
make that the story of your family. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 884; 
that the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; I further ask unan-
imous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
face a challenge at the border; there is 
no question about it. 
It really strikes me as strange— 
maybe unusual—for Members of the 
Senate from the other side of the aisle 
to come and yearn for those wonderful 
days of the Trump administration 
when it came to the issue of immigra-
tion and border policy. 
Remember when we had the longest 
government shutdown in history, para-
lyzing immigration courts and other 
Agencies? It was, of course, a shutdown 
that was sanctioned by the President 
of the United States over his immigra-
tion demands. 
Under President Trump, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, inciden-
tally, experienced unprecedented lead-
ership problems. The Department of 
Homeland Security lurched from one 
Secretary or Acting Secretary to the 
next. Listen to this: There were six dif-
ferent Secretaries in that Agency in 4 
years, only two Senate-confirmed— 
more Agency heads in the last 4 years 
under President Trump than in the 13- 
year history of the Department of 
Homeland Security prior to President 
Trump. They couldn’t keep anybody on 
the job. They quit. They were fired. No-
body could agree with this President’s 
bizarre ideas on what to do with immi-
gration. Are we longing for a return to 
those days? 
President Trump unlawfully diverted 
billions of dollars in Department of De-
fense funds to build a wasteful, ineffec-
tive border wall, which was supposed to 
be paid for by the Mexicans, if I re-
member, and then he created a human-
itarian crisis at the border with a pol-
icy known as zero tolerance—zero tol-
erance. 
I remember when Attorney General 
Sessions came before the American 
people and actually quoted the Bible to 
justify the forcible removal of infants, 
toddlers, and children from their par-
ents’ arms. Over 2,200 children were 
physically separated from their parents 
as part of the zero tolerance policy. 
It wasn’t until a Federal court judge 
in Southern California finally said to 
the Trump administration, ‘‘I demand 
that you account for these children, 
and I demand that you reunite them 
with their parents’’ that they set out 
to do it. Today, years later, years after 
zero tolerance, there are still hundreds 
of children separated at that time who 
have never been reunited with their 
parents. 
Do we want to return to those won-
derful days of the Trump administra-
tion immigration policy? I don’t think 
so. Children in cages, children lost, 
adrift on the bureaucratic sea, doesn’t 
speak well of America’s values. 
President Trump tried to end asylum 
protections for children and other vul-
nerable migrants. He cut aid to Central 
America, directly harming efforts to 
fight poverty and violence in the re-
gion. More refugees were driven to our 
border because the President shut 
down legal avenues for immigration 
and blocked all assistance to stabilize 
the Northern Triangle countries, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. 
Now comes the Senator from Utah— 
and he and I have worked on legisla-
tion together in the past. I know that 
we can find bipartisan solutions. I 
don’t think this approach is one of 
them, but perhaps it is the beginning of 
a conversation. 
The President’s former Republican 
allies in Congress claim that the real 
cause, the real problem behind immi-
gration policy is humanitarian protec-
tion for children. They claim that we

March 24, 2021 
can protect children by overturning 
these humanitarian protections, either 
that have been entered into in a con-
sent decree in court or by law, and sub-
jecting children at the border to indefi-
nite detention and deportation without 
adequate due process. But there is no 
evidence that this will deter desperate 
families from fleeing to our border. 
There is one thing the Senator from 
Utah and I certainly agree on. Many of 
these children and families are being 
horribly, horribly exploited by coyotes 
and kidnappers and very bad people. 
Many of these people and their children 
are suffering in unimaginable ways be-
cause of this. 
I renew the plea that has been given 
across Central America by this admin-
istration: Don’t send your people to our 
border. Don’t send your children to our 
border. 
It is not something we should encour-
age under the circumstances. It has to 
be orderly, and this is not in many re-
spects. 
There is no evidence that ending this 
humanitarian protection for children 
will deter desperate families fleeing to 
our border. 
The bill before us today includes no 
assurances that children will be hu-
manely treated or that they will be 
safe from violence once they are de-
ported. This notion that once these 
children come across the border or are 
taken into custody by the U.S. Govern-
ment, 
that 
sometime—2 
weeks, 
4 
weeks, 6 weeks—later they are turned 
loose again does not dispense our moral 
obligation. We want these children to 
be safe, and that is what the laws are, 
the Flores decision and others. 
This bill does nothing to address root 
causes that are causing migrants to 
flee the Northern Triangle in record 
numbers. If people were migrating be-
cause of so-called legal loopholes, they 
would be coming to our southern bor-
der from all over the region. 
Instead, the vast majority come from 
three countries: Honduras, El Salvador, 
and Guatemala. Those countries have 
the highest homicide rates, some of 
them, in the world, and girls face a 
constant threat of sexual violence with 
little prosecution from local authori-
ties. We are doing desperate things be-
cause of the desperate situations in 
these countries. 
We are told by the Senator that we 
have to overturn the bipartisan Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Reauthor-
ization Act, which passed by unani-
mous consent in the Senate and was 
signed into law by Republican Presi-
dent George W. Bush. But the TVPRA 
ensures that the United States meets 
its international obligations to protect 
unaccompanied children seeking safe 
haven in our country. It was a response 
to bipartisan concern that children ap-
prehended by the Border Patrol were 
being returned to countries where they 
might be exploited even more. 
Under TVPRA, unaccompanied chil-
dren from the Northern Triangle are 
transferred 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services and placed 
in deportation proceedings, which gives 
them a chance to finally make their 
case to a judge. 
Consider Samuel and Amelie, siblings 
ages 3 and 6, from Honduras. They ar-
rived in the United States traumatized, 
ages 3 and 6. They said nothing—silent. 
After being transferred to HHS, Amelie 
revealed that both children had been 
raped by drug cartel members. Without 
TVPRA protection, Samuel and Amelie 
would have been returned to Honduras 
and almost certain further exploi-
tation. 
Democrats are trying to work on a 
bipartisan repair of this immigration 
system. It is long overdue. 
In 2019, after President Trump finally 
agreed to end the longest government 
shutdown in history, Congress passed 
an omnibus appropriations bill that in-
cluded $414 million for humanitarian 
assistance at the border and then 
passed an emergency supplemental for 
$4.6 billion of additional funding to al-
leviate overcrowding in detention fa-
cilities. 
In 2018, Senate Democrats supported 
a bipartisan agreement, including ro-
bust border security funding and doz-
ens of provisions to strengthen border 
security, but President Trump threat-
ened to veto it and, instead, pushed for 
his hardline plan with the largest cut 
in legal immigration in almost a cen-
tury. 
When it comes to refugees, after 
World War II, when the United States 
sadly turned away hundreds and thou-
sands of ultimate victims of the Holo-
caust and would not accept their ref-
ugee status, we set out to prove to the 
world that we had learned a valuable 
lesson, and we led the world in offering 
refugee status until President Trump, 
who brought the numbers down to 
record low levels. That does not speak 
well for the United States, or it 
shouldn’t be a source of pride for any-
one reflecting this administration. 
We need comprehensive immigration 
reform. I support it. Eight years ago, in 
2013, I was part of the Gang of 8, a bi-
partisan group of four Republican and 
four Democratic Senators. We produced 
comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
legislation that passed the Senate 68 to 
32. The Senator from Utah voted 
against it. Unfortunately, Republicans 
who controlled the House of Represent-
atives refused to consider it. 
So here is my invitation to the Sen-
ator from Utah and to everyone else in-
terested. Let us sit down again and 
write that bill. Let’s do it in a fashion 
that really does bring reform to our 
system. 
I just talked at a bipartisan meeting 
on the subject earlier. One of the Sen-
ators from a border State said: People 
in my State don’t expect the Federal 
Government to do anything because it 
has been so many years since they have 
done anything. 
It is time for us to prove them wrong. 
We have the authority. We have the op-
portunity. We have the challenge. 
Making this sort of request on the 
floor, I know, is symbolic, but I have to 
say that it is not the symbolism we 
should follow, and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The senior Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I appre-
ciate the sentiment expressed by my 
friend, my distinguished colleague, the 
senior Senator from Illinois, particu-
larly when he expressed the desire no 
longer to have people send their chil-
dren on the long, perilous journey from 
Central America to the United States. 
On that, he and I certainly agree, just 
as we have agreed on a number of other 
issues over the years. 
I do think it is regrettable that we 
are not able to reach this agreement 
today. This is something we ought to 
be able to solve right here, right now. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
dire 
set 
of 
cir-
cumstances. 
We have to remember what we are 
talking about is dealing with the Flo-
res agreement. We are in a position 
where so many of the children coming 
up through these caravans are in dan-
ger because we have in place policies 
that require the release of minors to 
any adult claiming to be the child’s 
parent. We ought to have expedited 
processing requirements for unaccom-
panied minors, just as we have in place 
already 
for 
unaccompanied 
minors 
coming from Mexico and coming from 
Canada. 
It makes me wonder: What is it about 
children from Central American coun-
tries—from any country other than 
Canada and Mexico—that makes them 
undeserving of that same expedited 
processing requirement? This is some-
thing we need to do. 
Yes, I understand that our immigra-
tion system is a mess and needs re-
form, but I don’t understand why it is 
that anyone would want to accept the 
default assumption that we can’t fix 
anything with immigration; we can’t 
even fix this problem subjecting these 
unaccompanied minors from Central 
American countries, including Guate-
mala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Why 
can’t we give them any relief here until 
such time as we can come up with a 
comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
proposal? 
It is disappointing to me that we 
can’t do that today. We will keep try-
ing, keep moving on this effort. This is 
important. 
Look, regardless of where one stands 
politically, what party one belongs to, 
I don’t think it is too much to ask to 
suggest that we shouldn’t give kids 
over to anyone claiming to be their 
parent without proof, without proc-
esses to make sure that is a safe per-
son. We wouldn’t want our own chil-
dren treated that way. We shouldn’t 
treat them that way. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from Illinois.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1742 
March 24, 2021 
Calendar No. 30, the nomination of 
Adewale O. Adeyemo, to be Deputy 
Secretary of the Treasury, be with-
drawn and, notwithstanding rule XXII, 
on Thursday, March 25, at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate proceed to executive ses-
sion and vote on the nomination with-
out intervening action or debate; that 
if confirmed, the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; further, that no further motions 
be in order, that any related state-
ments be printed in the RECORD, that 
the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action, and the Senate 
then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
want to come to the floor to bring up 
four subjects. The first one is 30 sec-
onds. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, we hear from 
Democrats that they want to do things 
in a bipartisan way. Last year, Senator 
WYDEN and I developed a bipartisan bill 
that would save the taxpayers $95 bil-
lion and reduce the cost of prescription 
drugs. 
Everybody 
wants 
that. 
President 
Trump wanted it, President Biden 
wanted it, and there is no reason why 
in 1 week we couldn’t get that bill 
passed. We don’t have to wait until sev-
eral weeks down the road to do some-
thing like that. 
It didn’t come up last Congress be-
cause both Senator SCHUMER and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL were against it. It is 
bipartisan. We ought to move on that. 
(The remarks of Mr. GRASSLEY per-
taining to the introduction of S. 949 are 
printed 
in 
today’s 
RECORD
under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, on another sub-
ject, I want to speak again about the 
border crisis created by the Biden ad-
ministration. I spoke on this subject 
just last week, and the situation has 
not improved since then. 
Encounters with family units and un-
accompanied alien children continue to 
increase. There are now new reports 
that at some segments of the border, il-
legal immigrants are being released 
into the interior of the United States 
without receiving a notice to appear in 
immigration court. To be clear, it ap-
pears that the administration is now 
releasing some illegal immigrants into 
the United States without even at-
tempting to give them immigration 
court dates, much less taking any real 
steps to ensure that they actually 
schedule their hearings and show up for 
their court dates in the future. 
Once again, this is totally unaccept-
able. This is catch-and-release without 
even pretending to care whether the 
immigrants show up for court or are 
removed from the country in the fu-
ture. This is also not sustainable. 
Every sovereign nation has a right as 
well as a duty to its citizens to control 
its borders. What we are seeing from 
this administration isn’t border con-
trol or security. You see it on tele-
vision. It is chaos. It is what happens 
when you broadcast to the world that 
you have no intention of enforcing our 
Nation’s immigration laws. 
The President could take action to 
end this crisis today if he actually 
wanted to. He could restore the Mi-
grant Protection Protocols and the 
asylum cooperative agreements that 
the Trump administration signed with 
El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. 
He could start building more physical 
infrastructure along our southern bor-
der as administrations of both parties 
have done for over 20 years, including 
the administration in which Biden 
served as Vice President. Fencing isn’t 
something new, and it has not been a 
partisan issue until just here lately. 
Rather than propose unserious blan-
ket amnesty legislation that contains 
no real border security, the President 
could work with Congress on common-
sense changes to our immigration laws 
that we all know are needed. 
Finally, the President could make 
clear that he is in favor of fully enforc-
ing our immigration laws as written, 
across the board, remembering that he 
takes an oath that has the words to 
‘‘faithfully execute’’ the laws. 
Unfortunately, this administration 
believes that the surge in illegal immi-
gration at the southern border, due to 
its policies, is a process to be managed 
rather than a crisis to be stopped. As 
long as that is the case, we won’t be 
able to truly secure our border and cut 
off the flow of illegal immigration to 
this country. Let’s hope things change 
soon. 
ELECTION OF MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS 
Madam President, on one other very 
short matter, I want to speak about 
something that is going on in the 
House of Representatives that I think 
we all ought to abhor. Congress should 
not overturn a legal, State-certified 
election. 
I defended President Trump’s right to 
litigate claims of election irregular-
ities in our independent court system 
and defer to the judgment of inde-
pendent judges. I was initially criti-
cized for that position by partisans on 
the left who wanted me to make some 
sort of independent determination of 
election claims before the courts had 
ruled. I maintained my deference to 
the independent judges once the courts 
had ruled and Trump partisans did not 
like the rulings. So what happened? It 
led to criticism of me from the right 
then. 
When 
objections 
were 
raised 
to 
counting 
certain 
States’ 
electoral 
votes based upon State-certified elec-
tions, I voted against overturning 
those elections. 
My position remains the same with 
respect to the purpose of my remarks 
today, and that is the State-certified 
election 
of 
Representative 
MILLER- 
MEEKS, who now ably represents Iowa’s 
Second Congressional District. 
MILLER-MEEKS’ opponent chose to 
forgo her right under Iowa law to 
present any claims of election irreg-
ularities to an independent panel of 
judges. Guess what. That is because, 
under Iowa law, she had no legal claim. 
Representative MILLER-MEEKS won fair 
and square as certified by Iowa’s bipar-
tisan election board. 
The 
House 
Administration 
Com-
mittee is moving forward with a proc-
ess to overturn this certified election, 
stating it will ‘‘exercise its discretion 
to depart from Iowa law.’’ That is a 
quote I just gave from information 
given by the House Administration 
Committee. 
They are proposing that the House of 
Representatives exercise its discretion 
to depart from Iowa law. They were 
elected under Iowa law. Every one of 
the 
435 
Congressmen 
were 
elected 
under the laws of their State. Isn’t it a 
little bit outrageous that people would 
say we should ignore the law of Iowa in 
this case? 
I hope that we can get every one of 
Iowa’s four Congressmen and -women 
to vote to keep MILLER-MEEKS in of-
fice, and I want to hear from every one 
of my colleagues who decried over-
turning State-certified elections in 
January if each still holds that posi-
tion. 
Of course, attention to the Press Gal-
lery—I was asked more times than I 
can count if I accepted the results of 
the Presidential election. It would be 
very timely and a very relevant ques-
tion to ask Senators in the hallways if 
they accept the certified election of 
Representative MILLER-MEEKS. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am 
glad to hear the distinguished Senator, 
my colleague and friend, speak about 
the problems on the southern border. 
I feel for President Biden because he 
inherited a horrible mess from his 
predecessor, a man who said that he 
would build a wall, which he didn’t—a 
wall that would stop illegal immigra-
tion, which it didn’t—and that he 
would build it, saying he would get the 
money from Mexico, knowing that he 
would not get 1 cent from Mexico, but 
he repeated that falsehood hundreds of 
times around this country. He also ac-
tually took money away from housing 
for families on our military bases, from 
families living in substandard housing. 
It was money that Congress had voted 
for to repair the housing to make it 
safe, to remove lead, mold, and so on. 
He took that money to build a wall 
that he claimed, as I said, Mexico 
would pay for. 
When I was the chairman of the Judi-
ciary Committee, we passed by about a 
2-to-1 
margin, 
after 
months 
and 
months and months of debate and 
work, an immigration bill here in the

Senate. Republicans and Democrats 
voted for it, and it certainly could have 
solved all of these problems. 
When it went over to the House of 
Representatives, there were enough 
votes to pass it there, but it would not 
be with a majority of the Republicans. 
The Republican Speaker said that he 
could not bring up the bill, even 
though it had passed, because it was 
violating a rule very sacred to them, a 
rule named after Dennis Hastert, a 
former Speaker, and they could not 
violate the great respect they had for 
Dennis Hastert and his rule. So, even 
though it had passed, they did not 
bring it up. Of course, subsequent to 
that, Dennis Hastert went to prison for 
child abuse. 
REMEMBERING JUDGE PETER W. HALL 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, I want to speak about 
a dear friend, U.S. Second Circuit 
Court Judge Peter Hall, who died on 
March 11. 
Ever since then, I have thought back 
to a conversation I had with him—just 
like many, many conversations I had 
with Judge Hall over the years—just a 
few days before he died. He was telling 
me about the health concerns he had, 
very serious ones, but that he was 
going to try one other thing that week-
end that he had hoped may give him a 
longer spell of life, but it didn’t. It was 
only a matter of days after that last 
conversation. As I said, it was one of 
many I had with him. A few days after 
that last conversation, he died. He died 
on March 11, just 1 week after announc-
ing his decision to take senior status. 
Chief judge of the Second Circuit, 
Debra Ann Livingston, gave a remark-
able tribute in which she acknowledged 
his death. 
In speaking for the court, Chief 
Judge Livingston said: 
Judge Hall was our beloved colleague, and 
this is a grievous loss for our Court and for 
all of our judges. Over the course of nearly 17 
years on the Court of Appeals, Judge Hall 
distinguished himself as a thoughtful and 
humane jurist. He was generous with his col-
leagues and ever considerate in matters both 
big and small. Judge Hall was committed to 
public service and taught us all by his exam-
ple. He was a kind and very dear friend. This 
is a sad day for the judges of the Court of Ap-
peals. 
A deeper read of the two-page an-
nouncement offered more insights that 
help us understand what made Judge 
Hall the exceptional jurist that he was. 
Noting that Judge Hall left a ‘‘lasting 
mark’’ on a generation of law clerks, 
Chief Judge Livingston shared an anec-
dote as was told by one of those clerks. 
She said: 
One winter morning we were working away 
in chambers, and he had not turned up. Not 
unusual, but we were all wondering if some-
thing had happened. He rolled in midday 
with his dirty work pants and torn flannel 
shirt—in other words, no more haggard than 
usual. He explained that he had taken his 
truck through the woods that morning after 
taking care of the horses but had gotten 
stuck. Luckily, he had an axe, so it was only 
a matter of chopping down a few trees to put 
under the truck tires for traction. He freed 
himself and made his way into chambers like 
it was nothing—just another day on the Sec-
ond Circuit. 
Chief Judge Livingston repeated that 
story, told by one of Judge Hall’s 
clerks. 
But, you know, the story speaks to 
the person Judge Hall was: never too 
important to carry out the chores of 
the day; never too far from the 
Vermont woods that he loved so much. 
I don’t know how many times I would 
talk with him, and we might talk a lit-
tle bit about the law or things like 
that, and then we would quickly go to 
tales of other Vermonters we knew, the 
things they had done, the places that 
we liked especially in our State. 
And I thought, as more tributes have 
flooded in, the most common remem-
brances, of Judge Hall include words 
such as ‘‘decent,’’ ‘‘gentle,’’ and ‘‘car-
ing.’’ 
His long career, which spanned years 
in both private practice and as a Fed-
eral 
prosecutor 
before 
joining 
the 
bench, demonstrated his commitment 
to the rule of law. It was a commit-
ment that he showed early on when he 
served as president of the Legal Aid 
Clinic, while still earning his juris doc-
torate at Cornell Law School. 
When I was chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee in 2003, I was 
proud to recommend Peter Hall for the 
circuit court vacancy left by the pass-
ing of another dear friend, Judge Fred 
I. Parker. And it was no surprise to me 
that his nomination was met with very 
little resistance, either from the White 
House or from Republicans and Demo-
crats alike on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I teased him sometimes about the 
fact that he was born in Hartford, CT, 
but moved to Vermont at the age of 11. 
Did that make him a real Vermonter? 
And the reaction I got from him was: 
Patrick, 
my 
great-great-grandfather 
served as Governor of Vermont in the 
mid-1850s. I had to admit, the judge had 
me there. 
He always considered Vermont his 
home, and we are grateful that he did. 
Marcelle and I enjoyed our friendship, 
and we send our sincere condolences to 
his wife Maria Dunton and his five chil-
dren and his five grandchildren. 
I would also note, in concluding, that 
Judge Hall’s former law clerks released 
a touching tribute, and I ask consent— 
and I will ask consent in a moment 
that it be printed in the RECORD, along 
with a list of their names, over 60 law 
clerks. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that at the conclusion of my 
remarks, their statement and their 
names be included in the RECORD. 
Vermont and the legal community 
and the Federal bench have lost a great 
champion of justice. 
As Chief Judge Livingston concluded 
in her statement, ‘‘Peter Hall lived a 
life of fidelity to principles, kindness 
to individuals, and service to the 
human community. He will be greatly 
missed.’’ This is a great truth. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT HONORING JUDGE PETER W. HALL, 
BY HIS FORMER LAW CLERKS 
On March 11, 2021, Vermont, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and our 
nation lost one of our best. Today, we honor 
Second Circuit Judge Peter W. Hall and 
write in honor of his memory. 
Since his appointment in 2004, Judge Hall 
served on three-judge panels in over 750 cases 
and authored more than 150 opinions in pub-
lished decisions. We consider ourselves ex-
tremely fortunate to have had the oppor-
tunity to assist him in that great work and 
to benefit from his example, mentorship, and 
friendship. To us, Judge Hall defines integ-
rity and public service. His commitment to 
protecting and upholding the U.S. Constitu-
tion cannot be overstated. 
Judge Hall was exactly what everyone 
should want in a jurist. If your faith in the 
American legal system had waned, Judge 
Hall could restore it. Litigants arguing be-
fore him have told us that from the bench, 
Judge Hall was fair-minded, engaged, percep-
tive, and honest. And that is exactly how he 
was in chambers too. Far from the cynical 
suggestion that federal judges are merely in-
struments of their appointing presidents, 
Judge Hall embodied the judicial oath, ap-
proaching every case individually and with-
out any political predisposition. All that 
mattered was achieving the just and legally 
correct result in every case, no matter how 
high profile (or low profile) the litigants or 
issue. 
Judge Hall kept his home chambers in the 
United States Post Office and Court House in 
downtown Rutland, Vermont. Judge Hall af-
fectionately referred to Rutland as ‘‘the Cen-
ter of the Universe,’’ and so it was for the 
years we were with him there. Clerking for 
him was not only an education in the law, 
but in life outside of the urban centers where 
many of us went to law school. Who knew 
there were so many nuances to the colors of 
fall foliage or that there was a ‘‘mud season’’ 
between winter and spring? Traveling down 
to New York City with him to hear cases 
once a month was a study in contrast. Judge 
Hall demonstrated how to flourish in both 
worlds; he was as comfortable in downtown 
Rutland as he was in the marble courtrooms 
of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse at 
Foley Square. Judge Hall could seamlessly 
go from tending to his horses on a Saturday 
to representing the Federal Judge’s Associa-
tion at the International Association of 
Judges on a Tuesday. 
Judge Hall possessed a rare and dedicated 
humility. You will not find indulgent, flow-
ery, or self-aggrandizing prose in his opin-
ions. Instead, you will find clear expla-
nations of what the law is and how it applied 
to the litigants before him, written to be as 
understandable as possible to anyone reading 
the opinion later. Of the more than 100 ma-
jority opinions and countless summary or-
ders Judge Hall authored in his time on the 
Second Circuit, the Supreme Court of the 
United States reversed only two (partially). 
We think that is a pretty good record, but 
you would never have heard Judge Hall tell 
you so. 
We are particularly grateful to Judge Hall 
for his willingness to look outside the tradi-
tional boxes for his law clerks. We are a 
unique crew, at least as law clerks to judges 
on the Circuit Courts of Appeals go. Many of 
us were non-traditional law students. Others 
graduated from law schools outside of the 
elite institutions whose students can expect 
to go on to Second Circuit clerkships. 
Others still took non-linear career paths to 
a clerkship, working in the law before com-
ing to chambers. Some of us were all three.

Law 
School graduates, and those from non-tradi-

his chambers. We hope that Judge Hall’s 
leadership in elevating diverse voices and ex-
periences will further cement his legacy on 
the Court and in the law. We owe him more 
than we could ever repay. 
Judge Hall was a hero and a guiding light 
to many of us. He was all a federal judge and 
a career public servant should be. The United 
States is a more just nation because of his 
decades of public service. We miss him dear-

Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I want 
to also just thank my colleague from 
Vermont for that lovely tribute to 
Judge Hall. 
I can see that he meant a lot to you 
and was a great public servant. So 
thank you, Senator LEAHY. 
Madam President, in a year of so 
much heartbreak and grief and death, 
it almost escaped notice that we had 
gone in this country a year without a 
mass shooting in a public place. 
But now we face the grim reminder of 
our American reality. In the space of a 
week, two separate mass shootings 
stole the lives of 18 people. And just 
weeks ago, we suffered a mass shooting 
in a health clinic in my home State of 
Minnesota. 
So here we are again, thrust into a 
familiar cycle of collective grief and 
frustration 
and 
anger. 
Our 
hearts 
break for the families and loved ones of 
those whose lives were stolen. Our 
voices cry out for change to end the 
scourge of gun violence. And our anger 
grows as our voices are ignored and we 
are told by Republican leaders that 
there is nothing that we can do to pro-
tect American lives from gun violence. 
Colleagues, it is our job to protect 
American lives. 
Today, I want to share with you the 
voice of Veronique de la Rosa. Her son 
Noah, just 6 years old, was murdered in 
his classroom at Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary, and she delivered this eulogy for 
her son at his 2012 funeral. 
I am going to read it in its entirety 
so that it can be included in the 
RECORD, the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, 
and can serve as a reminder of the 
human toll that our gun culture has 
taken. 
Veronique said: 
The sky is crying, and the flags are at half- 
mast. It is a sad, sad day. But it is also your 
day, Noah, my little man. I will miss your 
forceful and purposeful little steps stomping 
through our house. I will miss your per-
petual smile, the twinkle in your dark blue 
eyes, framed by eyelashes that would be the 
envy of any lady in this room. 
Most of all, I will miss your visions of your 
future. You wanted to be a doctor, a soldier, 
a taco factory manager. It was your favorite 
food, and no doubt you wanted to ensure that 
the world kept producing tacos. 
You were a little boy whose life force had 
all the gravitational pull of a celestial body. 
You were light and love, mischief and 
pranks. You adored your family with every 
fiber of your 6-year-old being. We are all of 
us elevated in our humanity by having 
known you. A little maverick, who didn’t al-
ways want to do his schoolwork or clean up 
his toys, when practicing his ninja moves or 
Super Mario on the Wii seemed far more im-
portant. 
Noah, you will not pass this way again. I 
can only believe that you were planted on 
Earth to bloom in heaven. Take flight, my 
boy. Soar. You now have the wings that you 
always wanted. Go to that peaceful valley 
that we will all one day come to know. I will 
join you someday. Not today. I still have lots 
of mommy love to give to Danielle, Michael, 
Sophia and Arielle. 
Until then, your melody will linger in our 
hearts forever. Momma loves you, little man. 
Veronique should not have had to eu-
logize Noah, her 6-year-old son—1 of 20 
children killed at Sandy Hook. 
So I ask my Republican colleagues to 
think of her when you suggest that 
families exaggerate their anguish for 
political gain. 
Just yesterday, one of my Republican 
colleagues dismissed this grief as ‘‘the-
ater.’’ No. This is life and death. 
So I am angry. I am angry because I 
know that we have the power to stop 
this violence, and yet our Republican 
colleagues stand in the way. They 
refuse to work with us. They continue 
to put the demands of the NRA above 
the demands of the people we are elect-
ed to serve—that we stop this horrific 
gun violence, that we protect the peo-
ple we are elected to serve. 
Madam President, we need universal 
background checks. We need to ban as-
sault weapons and high-capacity maga-
zines. We need to end this cycle, and we 
need all of us in Congress to find the 
strength and the humanity to take ac-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
PPP EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Madam 
President, 
small businesses and their employees 
are the backbone of our economy, par-
ticularly in States like those of the 
Presiding Officer and the State that I 
am privileged to represent, the great 
State of Maine. 
Later today, the Senate is slated to 
vote on cloture on the motion to pro-
ceed to H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension 
Act of 2021. 
As a sponsor of the Senate com-
panion bill, along with my colleagues 
Senator CARDIN and Senator SHAHEEN, 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
cloture motion. 
We are also delighted that several of 
our colleagues have joined us as co-
sponsors of the Senate companion bill. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
continues to be a lifeline for small 
businesses. It has made the difference 
between their shutting their doors and 
laying off their employees and their 
being able to remain open, survive the 
pandemic, and most important of all, 
send paychecks to their employees. 
Since the program was created last 
year, more than $718 billion in forgiv-
able Small Business Administration 
loans have been approved, securing 
tens of millions of jobs in this country. 
The program has also been respon-
sible for bringing approximately $3 bil-
lion to the State of Maine in forgivable 
loans that have allowed our small busi-
nesses, particularly those in the hospi-
tality industry, to survive the pan-
demic and continue to send paychecks 
to their employees. 
The current application deadline for 
the PPP is March 31. That is just days 
away. I continue to hear about the ur-
gent need for more PPP assistance 
from Maine’s small businesses and to 
hear from others who are eligible for 
assistance but whose financial institu-
tions are getting error messages from 
the Small Business Administration’s 
computer system. 
Originally, the SBA had used the E- 
Tran system. For some reason, it 
switched computers for this round of 
PPP, and we understand that there are 
more than 190,000 applications that are 
pending for approval that are likely el-
igible for assistance but are held up be-
cause of computer glitches or other er-
rors. 
The bill before us today mirrors the 
legislation that I introduced with Sen-
ators CARDIN and SHAHEEN in that it 
provides for a clean extension of the 
PPP application deadline. It would 
simply extend the application deadline 
for PPP loans from March 31 to May 31, 
just 2 more months, and then it would 
provide an additional 30 days for the 
SBA to process pending applications. 
So if a small restaurant, for example, 
applied for a second PPP loan for 
which it is eligible because its revenues 
are down by 25 percent, comparing 
similar quarters in 2019 and 2020, it 
would not lose out because it applied in 
May and the SBA did not get time to 
process the application. 
Our bill has been endorsed by more 
than 90 organizations, including the 
Nation’s largest small business advo-
cacy group, the National Federation of

Independent Business, which is key 
voting this vote. It has also been en-
dorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the American Hotel & Lodging 
Association, the International Fran-
chise Association, the National Res-
taurant Association, the U.S. Travel 
Association, and the Independent Com-
munity Bankers of America. 
The House passed this clean PPP ex-
tension last week by an overwhelming 
margin of 415 to 3. 
With the House now in recess and the 
Senate leaving this week, advancing a 
clean extension through the Senate en-
sures the continuation of this vital re-
lief for our small businesses and their 
employees. We simply have to get this 
done. 
I agree with my colleagues that there 
are further improvements that could be 
made to PPP, such as addressing an 
issue facing certain sole proprietors. 
Unfortunately, the new administration 
changed the rules, so sole proprietors 
who applied early when the program 
reopened in January were treated dif-
ferently than sole proprietors who are 
applying now. That obviously doesn’t 
make sense. We should have the same 
rule. 
I have talked with the new SBA Ad-
ministrator about this problem. She 
agrees that it is unfair and needs to be 
fixed and has committed to working 
with all the sponsors and with the 
House and Senate Small Business Com-
mittee to find a solution to ensure that 
the program is implemented as Con-
gress intended. 
But in order to ensure that there is 
adequate time to develop and imple-
ment these improvements, we must 
first, without delay, pass H.R. 1799 to 
keep the PPP open for another 2 
months. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
cloture and passage of this important 
bipartisan legislation. It truly is bipar-
tisan. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
MURRAY and I be permitted to com-
plete our remarks prior to the vote for 
up to 5 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID TURK 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
today the Senate is going to vote on 
the nomination of David Turk, who 
will be serving as Deputy Secretary of 
Energy. If confirmed, he is going to 
play a critical role in our Nation’s en-
ergy agenda and in leading the Depart-
ment. 
His experience in energy policy is ex-
tensive. He served in leadership posi-
tions 
at 
the 
International Energy 
Agency, the U.S. Department of En-
ergy, the U.S. Department of State, 
and the National Security Council. He 
is an expert in the field, and his quali-
fications are very clear. 
It is also clear from his nomination 
hearing that he is dedicated to all 
types of American energy. This is crit-
ical if we are going to keep America an 
energy-dominant nation. I especially 
appreciated his commitment to ad-
vance nuclear and carbon capture utili-
zation and sequestration technologies. 
During his hearing, he said that 
there are huge opportunities on carbon 
capture utilization and sequestration if 
we can work together and really go to 
scale. He also emphasized the need to 
construct CO2 pipelines to move the 
captured carbon, and I agree. Carbon 
capture technologies hold the key to 
major emission reduction while ena-
bling America to use the tremendous 
natural resources with which we are 
blessed. 
This issue has broad bipartisan sup-
port. Last Congress, I worked with 
Democrats, including SHELDON WHITE-
HOUSE and TOM CARPER, as well as Re-
publicans, including SHELLEY
MOORE 
CAPITO, to pass the USE IT Act into 
law. This bipartisan law will support 
the development of carbon capture and 
direct air capture techniques. 
This kind of groundbreaking research 
is already happening in Wyoming. The 
Integrated Test Center located outside 
of Gillette, WY, is hosting carbon cap-
ture research teams today. These re-
search teams are looking at how we 
can take captured carbon emissions 
and transform them into marketable 
products like building materials, cloth-
ing, and even hand sanitizer. So I 
would welcome Mr. Turk and Energy 
Secretary Granholm to come to Gil-
lette to see the fantastic research tak-
ing place there. 
Mr. Turk was also very responsive to 
the committee’s questions for the 
record. That has not been the case with 
every one of President Biden’s nomi-
nees so far. 
If he is confirmed, Mr. Turk must 
prioritize policies that take advantage 
of the enormous economic and national 
security benefits generated by Amer-
ica’s oil, natural gas, and coal re-
sources. 
The Biden administration has taken 
a sledgehammer to the economies of 
Wyoming and other Western States by 
declaring war on these natural re-
sources. Let me be very clear: Coal, oil 
and natural gas are not going away. 
America is going to rely on these re-
sources for decades to come. We need 
to use and promote every kind of 
American energy and the thousands of 
jobs that come with them. 
Coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, 
and renewables are all essential to 
America’s energy mix. Mr. Turk dem-
onstrated that he understood that re-
ality during his nomination hearing. 
He can be sure that I will hold him to 
the commitments he made during his 
nomination hearing to expand carbon 
capture as well as nuclear power. I am 
going to continue to hold the Biden ad-
ministration accountable as well. 
As I did in committee, I will support 
Mr. Turk’s nomination on the floor 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF RACHEL LELAND LEVINE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to strongly urge my col-
leagues to support the nomination of 
Dr. Rachel Levine. She is a highly 
qualified public health expert to serve 
as Assistant Secretary for Health. 
As the highest ranking health official 
in Pennsylvania, she led the State’s 
COVID–19 response by focusing on 
transparency and clear, science-based 
communication; giving daily briefings 
on the status of the pandemic; and ad-
vocating for the resources and support 
Pennsylvanians needed. 
Dr. Levine has been on the frontlines 
of this pandemic, which is why she 
knows firsthand what our States and 
communities need from the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
Even before this crisis, Dr. Levine es-
tablished herself as a trusted voice to 
the people of Pennsylvania on matters 
of public health through her work to 
establish opioid prescribing guidelines 
and education for medical students, 
make lifesaving treatment for opioid 
overdoses widely available, combat 
eating disorders, increase health eq-
uity, and help the LGBTQ community 
get healthcare. 
She was confirmed to both of her po-
sitions in the State with broad bipar-
tisan support. She passed out of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee with support from Re-
publican colleagues last week, and I 
hope she will be confirmed today in a 
strong bipartisan vote as well. 
I want to take a moment to acknowl-
edge what her confirmation today 
would represent for our country be-
cause, in addition to being a high 
qualified nominee, Dr. Levine is also a 
historic one. Upon confirmation, she 
will be the highest ranking openly 
transgender official in our government 
and the first one ever confirmed by the 
Senate. 
I have always said the people in our 
government should reflect the people it 
serves, and today we will take a new, 
historic step toward making that a re-
ality. 
I am proud to vote for Dr. Levine and 
incredibly proud of the progress this 
confirmation will represent for our 
country and for transgender people all 
across it who are watching today. I 
hope all my colleagues are as well. 
I would also say how glad I am that 
yesterday we voted to confirm Dr. 
Murthy as Surgeon General. 
During his last tenure as Surgeon 
General, Dr. Murthy established him-
self as a trusted voice on matters of 
public health, helped see our Nation 
through the Zika outbreak, and pub-
lished groundbreaking reports on the 
opioid epidemic and rising youth to-
bacco use. 
I am pleased to have Dr. Murthy re-
turning to the role of Surgeon General 
at this critical time. 
When it comes to ending this pan-
demic, we have a lot of work to do and

March 24, 2021 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is 
hard to believe that I am on this floor 
again after losing 10 more people, this 
time in Boulder, CO, to another hor-
rible mass shooting in our State. 
I am sure the Presiding Officer 
doesn’t remember that last week, after 
the events in Atlanta, I went over to 
his desk, and I said that we were so 
sorry in Colorado for what had hap-
pened in Atlanta, and then, just 3 or 4 
days later, it happened again in Colo-
rado. 
I have spent the last day learning 
about the victims of this terrible 
crime, and I want America to know 
what extraordinary human beings we 
have lost in my State. Here they are. 
Denny Stong, age 20. Denny was a 
graduate of Fairview High School, an 
introverted, smart kid who loved his-
tory and model airplanes. 
He had been covering shifts at the 
King Soopers and took enormous pride 
in his role as an essential worker dur-
ing this pandemic. He once posted on 
Facebook, ‘‘I can’t stay home. I am a 
Grocery Store Worker.’’ 
Neven Stanisic, age 23. Neven’s dad 
said he was, ‘‘a really good boy, a good 
kid . . . a hard-working boy.’’ 
His parents are refugees from Bosnia, 
who left in the 1990s to escape the war. 
The reverend at their local church said: 
‘‘His family fled the war . . . and ev-
erything they had was either left be-
hind or destroyed. 
‘‘They left everything to save their 
lives, and came here to have a new 
start,’’ said the pastor. 
They came to America to have a new 
start, only to have their son’s life 
ended by this senseless act of violence. 
Rikki Olds was 25 years old. Rikki 
had been working as a manager at King 
Soopers for 6 years. Her family de-
scribed her as a ‘‘firecracker’’ who lit 
up a room with her infectious giggle. 
Her Aunt Lori said: ‘‘She had a beau-
tiful way of just being her. . . . When 
you’re down, she just wanted to cheer 
you up, just by being around.’’ 
Tralona Bartkowaik, age 49. She co- 
owned a clothing and accessory store, 
Umba Love, with her sister, and was a 
frequent presence in the Boulder arts 
and music scene. 
She had a deep curiosity about the 
world that took her on travel from 
Nepal to Costa Rica. Her younger 
brother remembers her as ‘‘a beam of 
light.’’ 
Teri Leiker, age 51. She was a huge 
fan of the Buffalos at CU, a regular 
face at the Pearl Street Stampede. A 
friend called Teri ‘‘the most selfless, 
innocent, amazing person I have had 
the honor of meeting.’’ 
Suzanne Fountain, 59 years old. She 
worked for 15 years in the Boulder 
Community Hospital. She loved gar-
dening and was passionate about music 
and theater. A friend described her as 
‘‘the cream of the crop and a good per-
son, a good soul.’’ 
Kevin Mahoney, age 61. Kevin had 
worked in the hotel business but re-
tired early to spend more time trav-
eling, skiing, and visiting his daughter 
Erika. 
After learning of her father’s death, 
Erica wrote: ‘‘My dad represents all 
things Love. I am so thankful he could 
walk me down the aisle last summer.’’ 
Lynn Murray, age 62. Lynn was a 
mother of two and a retired photo di-
rector for prominent national maga-
zines. 
Her husband John said: ‘‘I just want 
her to be remembered as this amazing, 
amazing comet, spending 62 years fly-
ing across the sky.’’ 
Jody Waters, 65 years old. Jody 
owned a boutique clothing store named 
Applause on Pearl Street Mall, where 
she remembered all her customers and 
their favorite brands. She was a moth-
er of two and a grandmother who loved 
horses and hiking. A friend said: When 
Jody walked into the room, ‘‘she was a 
breath of fresh air, a light.’’ 
Finally, Officer Eric Talley. He is 51 
years old. He is a man of deep faith and 
a devoted father of seven. After losing 
a close friend to a DUI, he joined the 
police academy at age 40, just 11 years 
ago, to give back to the community. 
In 2013, he made headlines when he 
helped rescue 11 ducklings from a 
drainage ditch. 
Eric’s father said: He ‘‘loved his kids 
and family more than anything.’’ For 
their sake he was hoping to stay off the 
frontlines by learning to become a 
drone operator. But when the bullets 
rang out, he rushed into action, first on 
the scene, saving countless lives at the 
cost of his own. 
Officer Talley and these other folks 
represent the best of Colorado, and we 
certainly owe Officer Talley a debt of 
gratitude that we will never be able to 
repay. 
My heart goes out to all the families 
and the entire community of Boulder. 
We have endured too many tragedies in 
this State. So many other States are 
the same here. 
The shootings at Columbine High 
School happened right before my oldest 
daughter was born, Caroline. She is 21 
years old, and her entire generation 
has grown up in the shadow of gun vio-
lence—something none of us had to do. 
I remember after a gunman in Las 
Vegas took the lives of 59 Americans. 
That Monday I came to work and real-
ized during the course of the day that 
I was having meeting after meeting 
after meeting, and nobody was men-
tioning the massacre of 59 Americans. I 
don’t know if it was two or three or 
four of these events before that that we 
began to somehow accept this as nor-
mal—that we can lose that many peo-
ple and not have a conversation about 
what had happened, the headlines all 
moving on to the next thing. 
We can’t allow this to become nor-
mal, and it is not just the mass shoot-
ings. It is the daily shootings. The Pre-
siding Officer and I talked about it last 
week, what happened in Atlanta over 
the last couple of weekends, or on the 
West Side of Chicago. So we can’t move 
on. 
Boulder will heal, but this scar will 
always be there. My daughter’s genera-
tion will always bear the burden of a 
national government that did nothing 
to protect them. They and the children 
that I used to work for in the Denver 
Public Schools carry a burden that we 
didn’t carry. They have grown up with 
a reasonable fear that they will be shot 
in their classrooms or in their schools 
or at a movie theater or in any public 
place. 
I didn’t grow up in an America with 
more gun-related deaths than virtually 
any country in this world, and we can’t 
accept it for their America. I am not 
asking anybody here to show the cour-
age that Officer Talley showed or the 
other men and women of law enforce-
ment who constantly have to deal with 
the inability of this place’s capacity to 
deal with these issues. I am just asking 
us to show an ounce of their courage by 
doing whatever we can to keep weapons 
of war out of our community, to pass 
universal background checks, to limit 
the size of magazines, and to address 
the epidemic crisis of mental health in 
this country. It seems like that would 
be the least that we could do. 
In the wake of one of these incidents, 
I heard somebody say on a radio pro-
gram that this is just the price of free-
dom, that these murders are the price 
of freedom. What a shame that some-
body would say that and mean it. What 
a surrender that represents to our chil-
dren and to the victims of these 
crimes. What a sacrifice of their right 
to be free from fear. 
Who are we to insist that they live 
terrified in their own country? Nobody 
insisted that we live that way. 
But our failure to act has helped cre-
ate these conditions, and we can’t wait 
any longer. The Senate needs to act. 
There is nobody else to act but the U.S. 
Senate. 
I want to end by thanking my col-
leagues 
from 
Connecticut, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and Senator MURPHY, for 
their incredibly steadfast leadership 
for long before they came to the Sen-
ate. But I remember one of the darkest 
moments of my Senate career, the 
votes that we took after Newtown, 
when that elementary school, Sandy 
Hook, was shot up and 20 students were 
killed, and this Senate couldn’t even 
pass 
universal 
background 
checks. 
They are here tonight to continue to 
make the case that we need to act, and 
I want to again thank them for their 
resilience and for caring about the peo-
ple who lived and died in Colorado. I 
am extremely grateful for their exam-
ple. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend Senator BENNET for those re-
marks, for honoring the memories of 
those we have lost and commanding us 
to action. 
I remember getting a phone call from 
MICHAEL BENNET that Friday morning 
as Senator BLUMENTHAL and I were sit-
ting at a firehouse in Sandy Hook, CT,

March 24, 2021 
learning 
what 
had 
happened 
just 
around the corner at a schoolhouse. 
I remember getting advice from MI-
CHAEL BENNET about what you do as an 
elected official in the midst of this 
tragedy because he had already been 
through it once before. Colorado had 
already been through it more than 
once before. 
I think about this macabre club that 
an increasing number of Members of 
the Senate and House belong to in 
which we have this memory bank of 
what to do when a mass shooting hap-
pens in your district or your State—a 
set of capacities that no Member of the 
House or Senate, no Governor ever had 
to think about or ever consider pos-
sessing decades ago. Now, we call each 
other when these things happen to im-
part advice as to how to be helpful to 
communities that are grieving. 
I am thankful to have friends like 
Senator BENNET, who can be with oth-
ers at moments like this, but I hate the 
fact that he knows all too well what 
communities go through when some-
thing happens like happened earlier 
this week in Boulder. 
We thought about what to do to try 
to move this country and our col-
leagues to action after another spate of 
mass shootings. This is a really old 
chart that I brought down to the floor 
for years. These numbers are out of 
date, unfortunately, because, well, in 
2019, we were losing 100 people a day 
from gun violence. That is not the 
number from 2020 or 2021. We have seen 
a dramatic increase in gun violence. 
While in 2020 we didn’t see the mass 
shootings that we have been accus-
tomed to in years prior, we are now 
seeing them once again pop up on our 
TV screens in 2021. But the lack of 
mass shootings masked the reality, 
which was a dramatic increase in the 
number of people who were felled by 
guns over the course of last year. We 
thought about what we could do to try 
to make more real for our colleagues 
the scope of this epidemic, and we 
thought of maybe something simple, 
you know, to make people understand 
that these aren’t really numbers. The 
numbers are just a way to explain in 
aggregate who these people are, be-
cause each one of them is an indi-
vidual. Each one of them led a life. 
Each one of them had people who loved 
them. Each one of them loved people. 
So many of them, you can just see by 
these snapshots, were young. They had 
full lives ahead of them, businesses to 
start, and families to begin. None of 
that happened for them because they 
were shot, often at the beginning or 
the peak of their early life. 
So tonight I am hopeful that I will be 
joined by a number of my colleagues to 
do something simple, just to read into 
the RECORD, the permanent CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, the names of those who 
have died just in 2021. Every single day, 
there are over 100 people dying right 
now. I don’t think America has ever 
seen this rate of gun violence, with the 
exception of wartime, in our history. 
While we won’t have time to tell you 
the story of all these people, as MI-
CHAEL did about those whom we lost in 
Boulder, at least we can make sure 
that forever their name and a link to 
their story is in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 
Senator BENNET already talked about 
Lynn Murray and Suzanne Fountain, 
Teri Leiker, Kevin Mahoney, Tralona 
Bartkowiak, 
Rikki 
Olds, 
Neven 
Stanisic, Denny Stong, Jody Waters, 
and Eric Talley. Those are the victims 
from Colorado. I am sorry if I didn’t 
get the pronunciations perfectly. But 
we also lost, over the course of the first 
3 months of this year Patrice Lynette 
Jones in Indiana; Kelvin Darnell from 
Illinois; Kevon Dickerson from Ken-
tucky; Leah Brooke Hines from Ohio; 
Linda McMurry in Tennessee; Michael 
Uttley in Missouri; Jarrea Gardner in 
Pennsylvania; Robert Randall Turner 
III from Maryland; Maddox Jones in 
Georgia; Joseph Jackson in Florida. 
On Monday, the same day as the 
shooting, in Boulder, Alessia Mesquita, 
28 years old, was shot and killed in New 
Haven, CT, with her 1-year-old daugh-
ter sitting in the back seat of her car. 
She and her boyfriend were arguing in 
the car when he shot her to death. Ac-
cording to her mother, Alessia had 
been trying to leave her boyfriend. 
Alessia is described as a devoted 
mother who loved her children with all 
of her heart. Many of her friends really 
relied on her for advice and guidance. 
They said she would give the shirt off 
her back to help a friend. 
Her mom said: 
My heart has been shattered, and I don’t 
think I’m ever going to be right again. 
She was the second of eight children. 
She had two children of her own, and 
her mother will now raise her two 
grandchildren. 
Nobody heard about Alessia Mesquita 
being shot with her daughter in the 
back seat in New Haven, CT, on Mon-
day. Her life isn’t less valuable than 
any of those who were killed in mass 
shootings. But this country’s attention 
to the pandemic of gun violence, the 
epidemic of gun violence, seems to sur-
face only when there is a mass shoot-
ing. 
Benjamin Bagley was shot last week 
in Bridgeport, CT. He was 22 years old. 
He was remembered by friends and 
family as somebody who always kept a 
smile on the faces of people who loved 
him. He was a doting father. He was a 
loving son and brother and always 
made people smile. 
His friends wrote: 
He was taken from us far before his light 
was fully able to shine its brightest. 
He was one of six siblings, two broth-
ers and four sisters. He had two chil-
dren and one on the way. He was born 
and raised in Bridgeport. He was in-
volved in his church. 
His mom Michelle Brown said: 
I had to kiss my son lying in a hospital bed 
dead. I don’t wish this on nobody, not even 
my worst enemy. 
This wasn’t the first time Benjamin 
had been shot. He had been previously 
wounded in a shooting in 2016, but he 
had recovered. 
Kevin Jang was 26 years old. About a 
month and a half ago, in early Feb-
ruary, he was killed by gun violence. 
He had moved to New Haven just 2 
years ago to pursue a master’s degree 
at the Yale School of the Environment. 
He was a west coast native. He had got-
ten engaged 1 week before his death. He 
had earned a degree. He was an Army 
veteran. He was a present Army Na-
tional Guard member. 
He was shot outside his fiance’s 
apartment. His fiance said: 
Kevin was . . . a gift from God. He was a 
true and righteous man after God’s own 
heart. Life is so precious and short. My only 
hope is that he is with his Heavenly Father 
now in perfect peace. 
‘‘An extraordinary young man,’’ said 
Yale University’s president. 
I mean, I have a stack of names, 20, 
25 per page. We don’t have enough time 
tonight to read into the RECORD the 
number of victims of gun violence in 
2021 alone—alone. There is Adam Todd 
Saeed from South Carolina; Andrew 
Wesley from Ohio; Antonio Rowban 
Thompson 
from 
South 
Carolina; 
Artrell Conner, Louisiana; Beau Mi-
chael Wasmer, West Virginia; Brittany 
Wagoner-Moore in Ohio; Byron ‘‘B’’ 
Donnell Ross in Texas; Carolyn Ann 
Stephenson, North Carolina; Christian 
Parra, New Jersey; Christopher Bess,

pages. I have 20 more here. My col-
leagues will hopefully join me on the 
floor tonight to read some of these 
names into the RECORD. 
This is as astonishing as it is heart-
breaking. This country allows for this 
to happen, allows these individuals to 
effectively be nameless and to be anon-
ymous. Tonight we are reading into the 
RECORD only the names of individuals

who died in this year, and the year 
isn’t even 90 days old. How is it that we 
pay attention during the mass shoot-
ings but just sleep through the days in 
which all of these people are stolen 
from us through an epidemic that is 
preventable? 
This doesn’t happen anywhere else in 
the high-income world. No other nation 
permits this level of gun violence. 
Don’t tell me it is the price of admis-
sion to America. Don’t tell me it is not 
preventable. Don’t tell me it is inevi-
table. It only happens here. It only 
happens here, and it is really hard to 
comprehend the impact this has on 
people. 
I was in an elementary school in Bal-
timore, MD, about 2 years ago. I had 
gone there to see an afterschool pro-
gram that I had heard was very suc-
cessful. The school had started about 
an hour late that day because of a 
weather delay, and so when I was in-
side the school, at about 10 o’clock, 
kids were still just arriving. 
I went upstairs to join the young 
lady who ran this program, and we 
were about a half an hour into our con-
versation when buzzers started going 
off, and the lights flickered, and the 
intercom system lit up with somebody 
from the central office repeating over 
and over again: Code green, code green, 
code green. 
I didn’t know what a code green was. 
The person I was meeting with, who 
was just running this afterschool pro-
gram, didn’t know what code green 
was. 
Luckily, the front office called up 
and told us that ‘‘code green’’ means 
there has been an active shooting 
somewhere in and around the school 
and that everybody needs to turn the 
lights off, lock the doors, and shut the 
blinds. So that is what we did. 
It was 10:30 in the morning. After 
about 20 minutes, code green ended, 
lights turned back on, and we contin-
ued our discussion. I was shaken. 
This is a school I had never set foot 
in. I had only been there about 20 min-
utes, and there was an active shooting 
within a handful of blocks. So I wanted 
to know what happened. I stayed in 
touch with personnel at the school. I 
read the Baltimore papers over the 
course of the next few days to find out 
what had happened, and here is what I 
found out. A young man by the name of 
Corey Dodd, who lived just down the 
street from the school, had told his 
wife—I believe her name is Marissa, if 
I remember correctly—that he would 
drop their twins off at Matthew Henson 
Elementary School that morning. They 
had two other kids. She was busy with 
them. He said: I will drop the kids off 
this morning. 
So he drove the kids to Matthew 
Henson Elementary School, the twin 
girls, and brought them into the build-
ing. I could have been in that lobby 
with him that morning as I was coming 
in and he was leaving. He got into his 
car. He drove a few blocks home, and in 
between his car and the door, he was 
shot dead—10 o’clock in the morning. 
His little girl, the youngest, always 
waited for him at the door when he was 
arriving. Well, he never showed up to 
that door because he died that day. 
And his two little twin girls in that 
school at the same time that I was 
there, who might have been giggling as 
they took a break from instruction and 
the lights went off, and they got to 
chat with their friends, didn’t know 
that they were never going to see their 
father again. 
Think about it, how the lives of those 
children change when their dad van-
ishes from the Earth just like that. 
Think about how the lives of all the 
children in that school change when 
they have to contemplate the fact that 
their dads might not be home when 
they arrive next week or the week 
after, if it could happen to Mr. Dodd. 
Think about how the entire neighbor-
hood goes through trauma after trau-
ma when that happens so routinely in a 
place like Baltimore. 
You can’t understand the scope of 
this epidemic by just reading off these 
names. Adam Todd Saeed died. Jason 
Wilson died. Jath Burns died. Johnjairo 
Brito died. Johnnie Clark died. Jona-
than Joseph died. Jose Medero died. Jo-
seph Carney died. Justin Locklear died. 
Justin Marshall died of gun violence. 
So did Kristen Slack and Latarous Har-
ris and Lieutenant Justin Bedwell. 
They all died of gunshot wounds just 
in 2021, but they simply represent the 
surface. You scratch just a bit, and you 
will find their kids and their moms and 
their dads and their neighbors who are 
going through trauma right now be-
cause of their deaths. 
Research tells us that often there are 
20 people who experience definable 
trauma when someone close to them 
dies. And so even the names that we 
read into the record tonight don’t ac-
curately represent the scope of this 
trauma. Those kids’ lives will never 
ever be the same in Sandtown, the 
neighborhood of Baltimore in which 
this elementary school sits, neither 
will be the lives of those kids who go to 
that school. 
And maybe what was so inexplicable 
to me was that I had to work really 
hard to find out anything about that 
young man. It was barely a story the 
next day that he had died bringing his 
daughters to school and then returning 
home. Had there been six more people 
shot, maybe it would have made the 
papers. Maybe America would have 
paid attention. 
But think of it this way: What if that 
same story played out not in Balti-
more, MD, with an African-American 
father 
and 
African-American 
girls, 
what if that story played out in West-
port, CT, with a White father and two 
twin, blond-haired, White girls? Do we 
care less because Corey was African 
American? You better believe it. You 
better 
believe 
that 
headline 
news 
would have been running stories about 
an affluent, White, suburban father 
dropping his kids off at an affluent, 
White, suburban school and being shot 
before he entered his suburban home. 
We don’t care about individual loss of 
life like we care about the victims of 
mass shootings. That is a tragedy. We 
also don’t care about the loss of Black 
life. We don’t care about the people of 
color who die in the same way that we 
care when White people die in this 
country. That is just the truth. 
So, tonight, my colleagues and I are 
going to come to the floor—and I hope 
some will join me. I thank Senator 
BLUMENTHAL for being here to start us 
off—to read into the RECORD the names 
of individuals who have been lost to 
gun violence in 2021 as a way to make 
sure we recognize who they were and 
the lives that they led, but also as a 
last-gasp effort to try to convince our 
colleagues to do something. 
Tonight isn’t really going to be the 
night to go deep into policy. Senator 
BENNET talked about what we know we 
need to do. We can have that debate at 
another time. Tonight is a night to 
just recognize the scope of this epi-
demic, how many people are being lost, 
how many lives are being impacted in 
mass shootings and in individual acts 
of violence, in homicides and suicides 
and domestic violence incidences. And 
maybe, maybe by pounding into peo-
ple’s brains the human toll of this trag-
edy in mass shootings and in other 
forms, we can inch this body a little bit 
closer to doing the right thing. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am honored to follow my colleagues 
Senators MURPHY and BENNET, two fel-
low champions of this cause. 
Again, again, we have stood here so 
many times to advocate for measures 
that very simply would make Ameri-
cans safe. 
And I don’t accept that it will be our 
last gasp. I don’t accept that we will 
ever go away, that we will ever aban-
don this cause, no matter how long and 
how hard it is. 
Senator MURPHY and I were in Sandy 
Hook the afternoon of that massacre. 
We went through an excruciatingly 
heartbreaking, 
gut-wrenching, 
stun-
ning experience, but nothing compared 
to the children who were taken out of 
the school. Nothing compared to the 
teachers who shepherded them. Noth-
ing compared to anyone who lived 
through it or the emergency responders 
who had to see the scene of carnage 
that day and, of course, nothing ap-
proaching the trauma of parents and 
loved ones. 
So our club, as he called it, is one 
that pales in significance to the club of 
survivors and victims. It is more than 
the names we read tonight. It is the 
children who take cover when that 
code is rung. It is the teachers who suf-
fer the apprehension of wondering 
whether that day will be the one when 
there is a shooter. It is the parents of 
all children who send their kids to 
school and wonder whether, at the end 
of the day, they will see them again. At 
some level, maybe not all, maybe not

always, not every day, but that fear in 
the gut, that powerfully important ap-
prehension is there for many. 
When I was in elementary school, the 
fear was of nuclear annihilation. And 
the drills we did were to dive beneath 
our desks, as though somehow those 
desks could be protected in the midst 
of a nuclear attack. Absurd as it seems 
looking back, every one of us, during 
those years, wondered would that be 
the day. And on the days before the 
Cuban missile crisis, it became more 
real than ever. 
And for that generation, it was the 
fear. For this generation, gun violence 
is the fear that lurks constantly in the 
heart, in the back of the mind, and al-
ways a presence. 
The names that we are going to read 
tonight are a very partial list of the in-
juries because we are reading the ones 
who died, but many others were injured 
severely and horrifically: bones shat-
tered, flesh torn, futures changed for-
ever, and, of course, the emotional 
trauma of living through it. But we 
have to read these names because it is 
part of our responsibility to make 
them real and to remind ourselves, as 
much as anyone, that this issue is a 
matter of life and death in the way 
that few others that we debate in this 
Chamber evoke. 
At the beginning of the Judiciary 
Committee hearing the other day, just 
this week, we had a moment of silence. 
But we cannot be silent. Yes, we will 
offer thoughts and prayers, but we can-
not be silent, and we must do more 
than speak. We must act—honor with 
action. 
We cannot let these brave, wonderful 
souls go gently into this good night. 
We must rage, rage against the dying 
of the life. And that is what we are 
doing by reading these names, remind-
ing ourselves that we cannot accept 
these deaths as a normal. Even with 
the pandemic receding, we hope, the 
epidemic of gun violence continues. 
A gun, a firearm, especially an as-
sault weapon, makes fatal and irrevers-
ible some of the most serious problems. 
Whether it is domestic violence, sui-
cide, or simply a profoundly disturbed 
young man walking into a grocery 
store, or a racist and misogynist man 
going into a spa, the involvement of 
guns and firearms makes those inci-
dents deadly. 
The names that I will read will be of 
all ethnicities and religions and back-
grounds and races because firearms can 
be an equal opportunity killer. But 
Senator MURPHY is right that commu-
nities of color suffer disproportion-
ately. And in Atlanta, who can doubt 
that a hate crime turned deadly, poten-
tially, because of that gun.

Last week, eight lives were taken by 
gun violence, and they should be re-
membered and their lives counted. 
Delaina Ashley Yaun was a 33-year- 
old newlywed and mother of two, in-
cluding a daughter she gave birth to 
this summer. She put her family above 
all else and cared for family members 
and friends who needed help or a place 
to stay during tough times. 
Her manager said: 
Her heart was so big. She loved people. 
He describes how she would feed din-
ers at the restaurant where she worked 
who were homeless and bring them 
home to offer them showers and clean 
clothes. 
One friend described Delaina as ‘‘a 
light. She just made everybody happy. 
She loves to smile and joke and hang 
out with her kids and make sure they 
always had fun. She was a happy per-
son.’’ 
Hyun Jung Grant was 51 years old. 
She worked as a schoolteacher in 
South Korea before immigrating to the 
United States. She was a hard-working 
and loving single mother of two, who 
loved karaoke, dancing, and electronic 
music, and made the world’s best 
kimchi stew. 
One of her sons, Randy, wrote: 
She was a single mother who dedicated her 
whole life to providing for my brother and I. 
It is only my brother and I in the United 
States. . . . She was one of my best friends 
and the strongest influence on who we are 
today. 
Daoyou Feng was 44 years old. What 
we know about her from her friends is 
that she was sweet and kind. That is 
how she was described by her cowork-
ers as well. 
Soon Chung Park was an active 74- 
year-old mother and mother-in-law. 
She lived in Atlanta. She moved there 
several years ago to be closer to 
friends. And she was well on her way to 
living past 100. Because of the pan-
demic, she missed chances to visit her 
family in the Northeast but was plan-
ning to move back this summer to be 
closer to relatives and friends. 
Her son-in-law described that Soon 
‘‘just liked to work. It wasn’t for the 
money. She just wanted a little bit of 
work for her life.’’ 
Suncha Kim, 69 years old. She was 
married for more than 50 years, and she 
was a fighter and a rock for her two 
children and three grandchildren. She 
was a hard worker and enjoyed line 
dancing. 
Suncha came to the United States 
around 1980. She spoke little English 
and worked two to three jobs, putting 
her children first and always seeking 
to help others. She volunteered by 
cooking and fundraising. One of her 
grandchildren wrote: 
My grandmother was an angel. . . . As an 
immigrant, all my grandmother ever wanted 
in life was to grow old with my grandfather 
and watch her children and grandchildren 
live the life she never got to live. 
Xiaojie Tan, killed that day, before 
her 50th birthday. She was a dedicated 
wife, mother, friend. She was devoted 
to her job and dedicated to her fellow 
employees. Her husband said: 
She donated and gave money to her em-
ployees and treated them so well. She was al-
ways celebrating their birthdays, doing good 
things for them. 
She was curious, hard-working, and 
caring, always filled with joy. She 
worked long hours, every day, to give 
her family a better life. Her daughter 
said that Xiao was her best friend and 
that ‘‘[s]he did everything for me and 
the family. She provided everything.’’ 
Yong Ae Yue, 63 years old. She was 
an amazing mother of two sons and 
loved to cook Korean food. She came to 
the United States in the 1970s, and 
after being laid off during the pan-
demic, she was excited to be back at 
work. She enjoyed visiting friends, 
watching movies and soap operas, and 
reading. She always loved to read and 
have her dog at her side. 
Paul Andre Michels. He was a 54- 
year-old Army veteran, one of nine 
children, and he had been married for 
more than 20 years. He loved to fish 
and collect rare coins. He treated ev-
eryone like he was their uncle and did 
what he could to help others. 
One friend said of Paul that ‘‘[h]e 
would give you the shirt off his back.’’ 
His younger brother, John, said: 
He’d loan you money if you needed it 
sometimes. You never went away from his 
place hungry. 
My home State of Connecticut is not 
immune to gun violence. Sandy Hook 
is the best known of the tragedies, but 
there are others—many, many, many 
others—all around the State, in big cit-
ies, in small towns, in rural areas, sub-
urban. 
Nobody is immune. Nobody is pro-
tected against gun violence so long as 
the pipeline, the iron pipeline, even 
with Connecticut’s strong laws, draws 
guns across State borders. 
Here are some of the names and sto-
ries of people whose lives have been 
taken in Connecticut: 
Jaqhawn Walters was killed on Sep-
tember 19, 2020, in Hartford. He was 24 
years old. His mother Trician writes: 
There was an altercation with someone in-
side a store. The fight was broken up, but the 
other young man still shot him and then 
stood over him a second time and shot him 
again. 
Jaqhawn was a college graduate. He was 
known as a big basketball player for 
Albertus Magnus. He played overseas for two 
seasons before COVID hit. 
My son saw a lot of gun violence growing 
up in the city, and he became victim to it 
even though he tried his best to beat all odds 
with a bachelor’s degree in communications. 
He even played in Argentina as a profes-
sional basketball player, mentored kids 
through basketball. He got a proclamation 
for his work at the Parker Memorial Center 
and the Village, where he worked with trou-
bled kids. 
Jaqhawn’s coach at Albertus Magnus 
described him as ‘‘the type of kid that 
got along with everyone. His likability 
crossed every age generation. When I 
ran camp, 8-year-old kids, instantly, he 
was the guy. They’d all gravitate to-
ward him. Same thing with our team.

They loved him. Opponents loved him. 
I’ve gotten a lot of texts, and I got one 
from a Northeast coach who said, ‘He 
had that thing where he’d drop 30 
[points] on you, and every opponent 
not only respected him but genuinely 
liked him.’ ’’ 
Another coach said: 
Jaqhawn was very, very rooted in the Hart-
ford community, and he loved his town. So 
he was always going to be one of those peo-
ple that came back and gave as much as he 
was able. 
Another coach said: 
He had such an impact. The guy had so 
much more to give. 
That is the story of every one of 
these victims: so much more to give; so 
much more to give back, whether to 
Hartford or sons and daughters or par-
ents. 
Ethan Song was killed in Guilford on 
January 31, 2018, 12 days after his 15th 
birthday, with an unsecured firearm in 
his neighbor’s house. He lived a life 
filled with laughter, adventure, and 
passion. He lived with adoring family 
members Kristin and Michael Song. 
Ethan loved to ski and hike and play 
spikeball too. He helped his mom Kris-
tin in finding homes for abandoned 
puppies. Ethan loved food. He and his 
dad Mike ventured to find the best lob-
ster roll in New England. They sampled 
15 locations. 
He loved lacrosse, and he was good at 
it, making the all-star team one sea-
son. He was always interested in his 
family’s history. He tried to learn all 
that he could about his grandmother’s 
experience as a Holocaust survivor and 
went so far as to divert a family trip to 
the UK to see the Anne Frank house in 
the Netherlands. 
Ethan was also fascinated by his 
grandfather’s experience as a decorated 
intelligence officer in the Korean war. 
I am always so inspired by Kristin 
and Michael Song and Ethan’s sister, 
their strength and courage, their joy in 
life, and their unquenchable loyalty 
and love for Ethan. I have stood on the 
green in Guilford announcing my intro-
duction of Ethan’s Law, a safe storage 
law that they have championed with 
grace and dignity and power beyond 
words. 
And let’s say it out loud: This gun vi-
olence is every parent’s worst night-
mare, every parent’s worst fear—going 
to school, going to a neighbor’s house, 
going to a grocery store—wrong place 
at the wrong time: a neighbor’s house 
where a firearm was unsafely stored, 
watching the emergency response team 
pull to that neighbor’s house and 
knowing something is terribly, terribly 
wrong. Every parent’s worst night-
mare. 
And Lori Jackson’s parents know 
very graphically about that nightmare 
because their daughter, Lori Jackson, 
of Oxford, CT, came to their house 
seeking refuge from an estranged hus-
band. And that night, while her infant 
children 
slept, 
Lori 
Jackson 
was 
gunned down by that husband, who was 
under a protective order which should 
have barred his having a firearm, but 
at that point Connecticut law applied 
only to permanent protective orders. 
She was killed by that man even 
though he was under a protective 
order. She was 32 years old. She was a 
loving daughter and a mother of twins. 
And her mother also was severely in-
jured. 
And her parents, with that same 
grace and dignity and strength and 
courage, have championed protection 
for domestic violence victims and sur-
vivors. 
She had so much to give—like Ethan, 
like so many others. 
And we remember Noah, Charlotte, 
Jack, Olivia, Dylan, Catherine, Avielle, 
Jessica, James, Josephine, Caroline, 
Benjamin, Chase, Ana, Grace, Emilie, 
Madeleine, Allison, Daniel, and Jesse— 
20 beautiful, innocent children taken at 
Sandy Hook Elementary School in 
Newtown more than 8 years ago. 
We remember them for bringing 
bursts of light and laughter into the 
lives of their family and friends, for 
bringing love into the lives of all who 
knew them, and for their joy and 
boundless energy. Only 6 years old, but 
they had so much to give, and their 
lives cut short at Sandy Hook that day. 
And we remember the heroism of 
those brave, courageous educators that 
December morning: Victoria, Lauren, 
Anne Marie, Rachel, Mary, and Dawn. 
We remember their courage, some of 
them 
physically 
shielding 
students 
with 
their 
own 
bodies, 
running 
unhesitatingly toward danger, barri-
cading classrooms, drawing on all their 
reserves of calm and professionalism to 
protect and shield the children in their 
care. 
We read these names, I feel, almost 
as a form of prayer. We cannot save 
any of these victims, but we know we 
can save others. And that is our work. 
As John F. Kennedy said in his inau-
gural speech, ‘‘here on earth God’s 
work must truly be our own.’’ Thank 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today to join my colleagues. At 
this juncture, it is hard to find the 
words. How many more shootings, how 
many more individuals have to die be-
fore we take action? And I rise because 
the Senator—my colleague, the great 
Senator from Connecticut—was identi-
fying these names as a form of prayer, 
which I could not have said that better, 
because this is about recognizing those 
we have lost in order to prevent future 
loss of life. 
So I join them to recognize individ-
uals across the country and in my 
home State of Nevada who have lost 
their lives: Vincent Brown of Colorado; 
Zaimier Bell of New Jersey; Anthony 
Stanley of Missouri; Bao Yang, Min-
nesota; Daisy Navarrete of Texas; 
David Camacho, Rhode Island; Deonte 
Minor, Washington, DC; Ronald B. Wil-
liams from Indiana. All of these indi-
viduals were killed by gun violence. 
And just those names would be too 
many. Yet they represent a few and a 
heartbreakingly long list of victims, 
families, and communities whose lives 
have been ripped apart by senseless gun 
violence just this year. 
Sadly, my home State of Nevada has 
been no stranger to this pain. In Las 
Vegas, on October 1, 2017, a gunman 
opened fire on a crowd of thousands of 
people at the Route 91 Harvest Music 
Festival. He killed 58 people that night. 
Two more victims have since died from 
injuries they received that evening. 
And hundreds, hundreds more were in-
jured—people who just wanted to enjoy 
an evening of celebration with their 
friends and family. 
I know the fear and the trauma that 
so many families experienced that day. 
My niece was at that concert, and my 
family and I are incredibly grateful 
that she made it home safely. But I 
will 
never 
forget—never 
forget—on 
that Monday after the horrific shoot-
ing that took place, sitting at the Rec-
onciliation Center in Las Vegas with 
the families, with the parents, the un-
cles, the aunts, the siblings, who were 
waiting to find out what happened to 
their loved one. 
Can you imagine? It is the most hor-
rific thing any family member could go 
through. You are waiting to hear what 
happened to your family member—your 
child, your son, daughter, your niece, 
your nephew, your father, your moth-
er—and you are hoping that as time 
and the clock ticks away, your child is 
not one that is in the backroom with a 
coroner right now. 
I cannot tell you how heartbreaking 
it was to be with those families and 
talking to them and the fear and the 
anxiety and the helplessness and the 
hope that still they clung to that they 
would find out that their child or their 
brother or their mother or sister was 
really safe somewhere in one of the 
hospitals in Las Vegas. 
No one can imagine that, and no one 
should have to imagine it. And no one 
should ever have to go through that. 
But that is what families and loved 
ones have been going through over the 
years because of the senseless gun vio-
lence that is happening across this 
country. 
Every day, more than 100 families 
lose a loved one to gun violence. Austin 
Cooper Meyer, age 24, from Sparks, NV; 
Brennan Lee Stewart, age 30, from 
North Las Vegas; Cameron Lee Robin-
son, age 28, from Las Vegas; Charleston 
Hartfield, age 34, from Henderson, NV, 
a police officer; Erick Steven Silva, age 
21, from Las Vegas; Laura Ann Shipp, 
age 50, from Las Vegas; Neysa Chris-
tina Tonks, age 46, from Las Vegas; 
Quinton Joe Robbins, age 20, from Hen-
derson—those are just 8 of the 60 Amer-
icans who lost their lives during the 
Route 91 Harvest festival shooting in 
Las Vegas on October 1, and their 
names and stories will stick with us 
forever. 
But we also have to remember the 
loved ones they have left behind. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1752 
March 24, 2021 
many of these names I know now not 
just because of the horrific shooting 
but because I have met their family 
members whom they have left behind— 
children who were left behind, children 
who lost their parent to this horrific 
gunfire, husbands and wives, mothers 
and fathers. It just goes on and on and 
on. 
In the next few minutes, I want to 
share some stories of Nevadans whose 
lives have been altered by gun vio-
lence. Many of these stories are heart-
breaking, and they stem from the Octo-
ber 1 mass shooting that took place in 
Las Vegas. 
Before I talk about them, however, I 
have to also recognize and praise the 
many heroes who stood up and worked 
to protect our community that night. 
After the bullets stopped raining 
down on the Las Vegas Strip, a former 
marine turned a truck into a makeshift 
ambulance and drove more than two 
dozen people to one of our hospitals. A 
couple provided CPR to injured victims 
on 
the 
site. 
And 
hundreds 
of 
concertgoers risked their lives car-
rying fellow concertgoers to safety. 
In fact, many younger attendees al-
ready had a sense of what to do to stop 
the bleeding from bullet holes and 
knew to run for safety in the breaks in 
between the sounds of gunshots be-
cause of training they had received in 
their schools and workplaces. 
But after the shooting, I received a 
letter from a constituent who survived 
the Las Vegas shooting, and she wrote: 
On October 1st, 2017, our life was forever 
changed. . . . My husband and I attended the 
Route 91 Harvest Festival. We were having 
the time of our lives, enjoying the different 
bands we got to see and singing along with 
all our favorite songs. [My husband] and I 
were so moved when [one of the bands] led 
the audience singing God Bless America. 
Who would have known that just a few hours 
later our lives would be changed forever? 
When the shooting . . . started, I thought 
it was firecrackers. We looked around and 
then there were more shots. My husband 
pulled me to the ground, laying on top of me, 
shielding me from gunfire. He laid there 
tense waiting to be shot while I laid there 
waiting for him to go limp. We prayed and 
told each other we loved [one] another. I 
prayed we would live to see our children 
raise their children and I felt Jesus’ hands 
covering us. During a pause in the shooting, 
my husband pulled me up to start running. I 
was terrified, [because] we could hear bullets 
whizzing by and [we] could smell gun powder. 
There were three people, that I know of, who 
were shot right around us. The shooting con-
tinued for what felt like forever. We contin-
ued running and ran across Las Vegas Boule-
vard while the shooting continued. There 
was so much confusion and we didn’t know if 
there were more shooters. 
By the grace of God, my husband [and] I 
are unharmed physically. Our emotional 
scars are still to be determined. Sleeping has 
been difficult. I have had periods of uncon-
trollable shaking. I have chronic stomach 
pain and have . . . difficulty eating. All of 
this seems trivial compared to the families 
who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and 
daughters and the hundreds of people still 
suffering with physical injuries. 
Now, I read that letter because it is 
not just, as I have said before, about 
the lives we have lost, but it is about 
the lives who are affected by gun vio-
lence. Reading that letter is just heart-
breaking—and to think that her trau-
ma is experienced by so many other 
Americans from Las Vegas, from Park-
land, from Orlando, and from Boulder. 
It is a stain on our Nation. 
And I have, since that shooting, been 
able to meet so many incredible sur-
vivors of this shooting, including two 
sisters, the Marano sisters, who were at 
the concert that night and are still liv-
ing with the emotional scars from 
being there in that horrific shooting. 
Geena Marano has learned to prepare 
herself for Independence Day and New 
Year’s Eve, when the sounds of fire-
works can sound eerily similar to gun-
fire. But if a car backfires unexpect-
edly, she has to start the process of re-
minding herself: ‘‘You’re safe. It’s OK. 
Don’t worry.’’ 
And her sister Marisa, who was also 
at the festival, says her own daughter 
has picked up on the habit of reacting 
to loud noises. She said: ‘‘It breaks my 
heart because my trauma has [now] 
passed on to her.’’ 
The fear resurfaces for these sisters 
in so many situations: on anniver-
saries, including of all the shootings 
since then; at high schools, where 
Geena was doing outreach to students 
and feared that she was putting herself 
at risk of another shooting; passing the 
Strip, eerily during the COVID pan-
demic, like it was on the day of the fes-
tival, because the Strip was shut down. 
Anywhere there is darkness and music, 
even on an evening out, the sisters still 
feel the repercussions of that night at 
the concert. 
And they are not alone. While the 
tragedy of the Route 91 shooting may 
be 3 years behind us, for many sur-
vivors a moment can bring it all roar-
ing back, and many more live in fear 
that it could happen again. 
Telemachus Orfanos, a survivor of 
the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting, 
was killed when a gunman entered the 
Borderline Bar & Grill and shot 12 in-
nocent people on November 7, 2018. 
What happened to Telemachus and 
other October 1 survivors in the res-
taurant that night was a uniquely 
American phenomenon that we should 
not be proud of. We keep having these 
mass shootings in our country, and it 
is past time that we acted. It is not 
only what our Nation deserves. It is 
what these families and these survivors 
and those who lost their lives deserve. 
The Nevadan who shared her October 
1 experience with me ended her letter 
by stating: 
I am urging you to pass thoughtful, reason-
able controls that will enhance the safety of 
our society. It is time to take . . . action to 
protect our mothers, fathers, sons, daugh-
ters, nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. 
Please, do not sit back and do nothing. 
And she is right. We cannot sit back 
and do nothing. We must pass common-
sense gun legislation, like universal 
background checks that we have passed 
in the State of Nevada. That will help 
keep Americans safe. We owe it to our 
friends and families and all of the vic-
tims who have already been irrev-
ocably marked by gun violence to take 
action. 
Thank you. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend Senator CORTEZ MASTO for 
that powerful testimony, for sharing 
some of these stories talking about the 
impact on families in Las Vegas and 
throughout her State, and to talk 
about what this means from a parent’s 
perspective, to think that her own fam-
ily had to wonder whether their loved 
one was going to come back from that 
shooting that dominated the news, to 
think about how many lives were 
changed. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL made a really 
important observation earlier and that 
was that the numbers we are using 
here, 39,000 people dying a year, and 
the names that we are reading into the 
RECORD, these are the names of the in-
dividuals who have died, but what we 
know is there are hundreds of thou-
sands of others who have survived gun-
shot wounds. The trauma is different, 
but it is still serious and acute. 
When a loved one is shot, obviously, 
that comes with a moral disruption to 
the family that is hard to calculate. 
Often that injury has lifelong con-
sequences. The individual is bound to a 
wheelchair, losing the use of legs and 
arms. These are serious consequences 
that affect the rest of your life. 
While today we are reading into the 
RECORD the names of those who have 
died, this stack represents, I think, 
just a fraction of those who have died 
in 2021. It could be four times as high if 
we had talked about those who have 
been injured in episodes of gun vio-
lence. 
Other colleagues are going to join us 
here tonight on the floor. While they 
do, let me just read into the RECORD a 
handful of additional names: Carlesa 
Taylor; Cleveland Sanders; Cortney 
Smith, Missouri; Corporal Martinus

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1753 
March 24, 2021 
I am sure some cynical viewer to-
night may listen to a name they recog-
nize on this list and say: Oh, well, wait 
a second. I know that guy. He had a 
criminal record. That individual was 
involved with some bad people. 
There is never a justification for a 
gun homicide. No matter whether the 
individuals on these lists were perfect 
angels or individuals who had made 
mistakes, none of them deserved to die 
in an episode of vigilante or random 
justice. So to answer a hypothetical 
question, I haven’t vetted the names 
that I am reading because not a single 
person on this list deserved to go in the 
way that they did. 
I remember talking to a woman who 
has become a friend in Hartford, CT. 
She lost her son just about a month be-
fore Sandy Hook. She remembers when 
Sandy Hook happened that she latched 
onto the number of children who were 
killed. Twenty kids were killed that 
day in Sandy Hook. I asked Senator 
BENNET were there survivors from the 
shooting in the supermarket in Boul-
der, and he said he had to check, and I 
will check as well, but he wasn’t sure 
that there were individuals who were 
seriously injured. If that is the case, 
there are parallels to Sandy Hook. 
The weapons that are being used in 
these crimes are so lethal, so powerful 
that, increasingly, it is hard to survive 
wounds when a bullet enters your body 
at the speed that bullets are traveling 
when they come from an AR–15 or AR– 
15-style weapon as was used in Sandy 
Hook. 
In Sandy Hook, 20 kids were shot. All 
20 of them died. The number 20 was 
meaningful to my friend because her 
son was 20 years old when he was killed 
on October 20 of 2012, the year of Sandy 
Hook. He was killed by a 20-year-old, 
and he was the 20th victim of gun vio-
lence that year in Hartford, CT. 
She told this story about what her 
life was like after her son was killed, 
after Shane was killed. She said that 
first she just didn’t want to leave the 
house ever. She didn’t want to see any-
body. She would always walk down the 
street to the corner bodega to pick up 
groceries. I think it was only a block 
or so away. She came to driving there 
so there was no chance that she would 
have to meet people she knew along 
the way. Her life became fundamen-
tally different. Her life ended, as she 
described it, in so many ways when her 
only son disappeared from the Earth. 
She talked about this strange habit 
that came to dominate some of her eve-
nings. She would get up in the middle 
of the night and she would get in her 
car and she would drive to the site 
where Shane was shot. Shane was shot 
about two blocks from my house where 
I live in Hartford, CT. I drive by the 
site of Shane’s shooting almost every 
day when I am going back to our home. 
She would drive to that site. She would 
stop her car, and she would turn on her 
high beams as if she were waiting for 
Shane to show up, as if she were wait-
ing for him to come back. She knew he 
never was, but this became a habit. 
It just speaks to this immense, incal-
culable 
trauma 
that 
families 
go 
through when they lose a loved one, a 
trauma that you can’t truly under-
stand. 
In Sandy Hook, one mother adopted 
another curious but understandable 
habit in the years after Sandy Hook. 
She would, during an afternoon on a 
Saturday or a Sunday, convince herself 
that her son who had been killed in 
Sandy Hook was at a friend’s house. 
She would sort of create this fantasy, 
this fiction in her mind. She would find 
it a little bit easier to go about clean-
ing up the house or doing laundry or 
playing with her other children if, in 
her mind, she could pretend just for a 
half hour or an hour that her son was 
safe at a friend’s house. She was suc-
cessful in contorting her mind to give 
her that space for that short period of 
time. It is what she needed to do. 
It is something that you never ever 
want to have to contemplate, creating 
these fictions in your minds to allow 
you to survive just for an hour at a 
time, shining bright lights on an empty 
space near downtown Hartford, think-
ing maybe that your son will show up. 
These are contortions of action and 
thinking that nobody should have to 
deal with.

I apologize if I am mispronouncing 
some of these names. I am seeing many 
of them for the first time. But it is im-
portant for us to read these names into 
the RECORD so that at least they live in 
that space because the numbers aren’t 
moving our colleagues to action. 
So far this year, just 2021, there have 
been 9,649 gun-related deaths. These in-
clude homicides and murders, acci-
dental shootings, and suicides. Some 
people take issue with the fact that 
when we talk about the gun violence 
epidemic, that we are including sui-
cides in these numbers. There have 
been thousands of suicides in the 
United States this year, but it is im-
portant that we talk about these 
deaths together. 
Again, this evening is not going to be 
a time to go deep into the question of 
policy change, but when you do start to 
explore interventions and causes, you 
will find that many of the same causes 
for homicides cause suicides as well. 
For instance, there is a very clear 
correlation between poverty and gun 
homicide. There is a very clear correla-
tion between poverty and your risk of 
suicide. There is a clear correlation be-
tween the ease of access to a firearm 
and homicide as there is to suicide. In 
States that have universal background 
checks, there are generally lower rates 
of homicide and there are generally 
lower rates of suicide as well. We talk 
about suicides together. 
People are paying attention today to 
this epidemic because of what has hap-
pened in Atlanta and what has hap-
pened in Colorado. I understand why 
we pay more attention to mass shoot-
ings. There is something unique and 
frightening about large-scale, indis-
criminate slaughter. 
But mass shootings are just not those 
incidences where 10 people die; there 
are mass shootings where 3 or 4 people 
are shot. That is still a significant 
crime. So far, this year, there have 
been 104 of those. There have been 104 
mass shootings this year. You didn’t 
know that, right? You thought there 
was just Atlanta and Boulder. No, not 
true. There have been 104 mass shoot-
ings. 
I believe most times mass shootings 
are defined as when four or more people 
are shot at the same time, not nec-
essarily killed but shot. There have 
been 104 mass shootings this year and 
191 deaths and injuries of children aged 
11 and younger. Think about that. In 
this year alone, almost 200 kids, aged 
11 and younger, have been killed and 
128 deaths and injuries of teenagers, 
aged 12 to 17. 
In May 2020—think about this—there 
were 61 mass shootings. Now, in May 
2020, we were emotionally focused on 
the pandemic, and we were focused on 
trying to get people well. The country 
was not talking about gun violence in 
the way it normally would if there 
were 61 mass shooting in 1 month. That 
is the highest monthly total ever tal-
lied by the Gun Violence Archive, 
which is a nonprofit research group 
where a lot of our data and names 
come from. They began tracking data 
in 2013. Since they have been tracking 
the data, May 2020 was the highest 
number of mass shootings, but you 
didn’t hear about it because most of 
those mass shootings were of 4 or 5 or 
6 people, not of 20 or 30 or 40, and, hon-
estly, many of those mass shootings 
were likely people of color, which don’t 
get as much attention either.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1754 
March 24, 2021 
I am not even close to the 9,649 gun- 
related deaths in 2021 alone. 
I am glad to be joined on the floor by 
my colleague Senator KLOBUCHAR, to 
whom I will yield in a moment. I want 
to thank her for being a real steadfast 
partner in these efforts and, in par-
ticular, on focusing, as she has, on the 
crime of domestic violence. 
Senator 
KLOBUCHAR, 
earlier 
this 
evening, I was describing a murder in 
New Haven, CT, that happened on the 
same day as Colorado’s, in which a 
young woman was sitting in a car with 
her boyfriend and with her 1-year-old 
in the backseat. They were in an argu-
ment, and she was trying to leave him, 
and she shot him while in the car with 
the child in the backseat. I was talking 
about how little attention that got in 
Connecticut, never mind in the coun-
try, in how we pay attention to these 
mass shootings—and for good reason— 
and how every one of these individuals 
has a story attached to them. She was 
someone her friends relied on for coun-
sel and for moral support, and it is how 
that death initiates so many other 
traumas. 
I was honored to be able to read her 
name into the RECORD tonight. She is 
one of many who will now find their 
names in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD so 
that, at the very least, the RECORD of 
our proceedings will remember her life 
and think about what could have been 
had we not been so cavalier with her 
life and her safety through our inac-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator MURPHY so much for 
those beautiful words. 
When you honor the victims as you 
did, you honor all victims. What I have 
found about these crimes, particularly 
the crime of domestic violence, is, so 
often, the victims have been hidden 
from view. It is a crime that takes 
place in someone’s bedroom with the 
door closed. It is a crime that takes 
place in a house, a crime that no one 
ever sees. As you know, in a situation 
like this, when there is a gun, it be-
comes deadly. 
One of my memories is of years ago 
when a police officer in a small town in 
Minnesota responded to a domestic vio-
lence call. What a lot of people don’t 
know is that, oftentimes, those are the 
most dangerous calls police officers 
take. It was a victim—very young— 
who had called the police, and it was of 
someone who had severe mental illness 
problems, her boyfriend. The police 
went to the door, and the door was an-
swered, and the guy shot the police of-
ficer. He was wearing a bulletproof 
vest, but he shot him in the head. I was 
at that funeral. 
It is a reminder that the crime of do-
mestic violence isn’t just about one 
victim; it is about an entire commu-
nity. 
As the widow walked down the aisle 
of the church, she had her two little 
boys with her, and she was holding this 
little girl in a dress that was covered in 
stars. The last time that family had 
been in that church was for the Nativ-
ity play that the boys had been in. The 
dad had been sitting proudly in the 
front row, and now they were at his fu-
neral. That is what we are talking 
about with gun violence. 
I join my colleagues on the floor to 
honor Americans whose lives were cru-
elly and unjustly taken from us by gun 
violence, and I am going to read some 
names of people who should never be 
forgotten. 
In Alabama, Chase Green; in Arizona, 
Isaias Garcia Tovar, Sr., Isaias Tovar, 
Jr., and Delia Noriega; in Connecticut, 
Dwaneia Turner; in Delaware, Demier 
Chambers; in Florida, Earnest Lee 
‘‘Bug’’ Riggs, Jr.; in Illinois, Brenda 
Poss-Barnes, Greg Barnes, Sr., and 
Daniel Kinney; in Indiana, Chanel 
Neal; 
in 
Kentucky, 
Kenya 
Renee 
Cunningham, Demontray Rhodes, and 
Katherine Bryan; in Missouri, Johnnie 
Jones; in Ohio, Alonzo Lewis; in Ten-
nessee, Kevin Niyibizi; in Virginia, 
Eddie Jenkins; in Wisconsin, Kevin 
Kloth and Kevin Schneider. 
Those are just 20 names out of the 
thousands of people lost to gun vio-
lence every year—an average of 100 gun 
violence deaths each day. That is three 
classrooms of children. 
We also know the communities where 
mass shootings occur will never be the 
same. Atlanta, GA, and Boulder, CO, 
are now part of the ever growing list of 
cities and towns forever altered but 
never forgotten—Midland, Odessa, Day-
ton, El Paso, Virginia Beach, Pitts-
burgh, Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, 
Charleston, Newtown, to name a few— 
and I am greatly saddened that my 
home State of Minnesota also has com-
munities on that list. On average, 
someone is killed with a gun every 21 
hours in my State. That is 422 people 
each year. 
Tonight, I am going to focus on the 
loss of two women from Minnesota, 
both of whom were healthcare workers 
and both of whom were moms. For the 
past year, frontline healthcare workers 
protected us from the pandemic, but 
for Lindsay Overbay and Bao Yang, we 
failed to protect them. 
In February, Lindsay was killed in a 
horrible shooting at the Allina Health 
Clinic in Buffalo, MN, where four of her 
coworkers were also injured. This just 
happened last month. She was a med-
ical assistant at the clinic, and she de-
voted her life to healing others. She 
had a wonderful laugh that would 
make a room spark to life. Her husband 
said that her laugh was so distinctive 
that, if you walked into the clinic and 
you heard her laughing, you knew ex-
actly who it was. 
The spark of her own life was her 
family—her husband of 10 years and 
her beloved children, an 8-year-old boy 
and a 5-year-old girl. Friends said that 
she lived and breathed her kids and 
that she cherished every moment spent 
with them. Her field of cardiology put 
her in contact with older patients 
whom she loved caring for because she 
said, ‘‘They are at an age where they 
say what they are thinking.’’ It is gut- 
wrenching and heartbreaking to think 
that Lindsay won’t get to that age, 
won’t get that happy freedom, won’t 
get to see her two children grow up and 
graduate and have families of their 
own. 
It has been reported that the shooter, 
whom some described as being a dis-
gruntled patient, had previously made 
threats against the clinic. 
Although we don’t know whether this 
tragedy could have been prevented, in 
some way, we know it could have been. 
We should be doing more to encourage 
States to pass commonsense laws and 
to pass laws right here in this body 
that allow family members or law en-
forcement to get a court order to tem-
porarily prevent a person from buying 
a gun who is in crisis. 
By the way—and Senator MURPHY 
knows this—after Parkland, I was in 
the White House when Donald Trump 
was President. I was seated across from 
him, and I was seated next to former 
Vice President Pence. I was there be-
cause of the domestic violence bill that 
I lead, and I still have the piece of 
paper on which I wrote the hashtags 
when Donald Trump said that he was 
for universal background checks not 
once, not twice, not three times, but 
multiple times. When we talked about 
this very issue—the idea of getting a 
court order to temporarily prevent a 
person who is in crisis from buying a 
gun, which is something that Vice 
President Pence supported because of 
what had happened in Indiana, and 
they had a similar law—President 
Trump said he was for it, that he was 
for this stuff. 
Then what happened? We all know 
this. The next day or 2 days later, after 
this meeting that we had that was on 
TV, he met with the NRA, and he 
backed down. We can’t keep backing 
down, and we know we now have a 
President in Joe Biden who will not 
back down. 
Here is another story. 
Just days ago, we lost another moth-
er of two, Ms. Bao Yang of St. Paul, 
MN. She worked hard to raise her sons, 
ages 21 and 11, as a single mom. She 
held multiple jobs while she studied to 
be a nurse—graduating and getting her 
license a few years ago. 
According to her son, ‘‘all she ever 
wanted was to raise my little brother 
in the best life she could give him. I 
could see how much stress she carried 
every day but still always managed to 
provide for’’ us. 
Bao’s sister said she was a sweet, lov-
ing, caring, hard-working person who 
only wanted the best for everyone. 
But a few days ago—right around the 
time as what happened in Atlanta; 
these stories are both completely fresh; 
they 
just 
happened—on 
Saturday 
morning at 8:30, the police were called 
to her house, and they found that she 
had been shot. She died later that

S1755 
March 24, 2021 
morning. According to her family, she 
was a victim of domestic violence, 
turned deadly because of a gun. Her 
killer was her former boyfriend. 
Unfortunately, her story is far too 
common. According to the Department 
of Justice, nearly half of the women 
who are killed by intimate partners are 
killed by current or former dating 
partners. 
Violence Free Minnesota, which is a 
statewide coalition of organizations 
that provides services to victims of do-
mestic abuse, said of her homicide that 
she was the eighth Minnesotan to die 
due to domestic violence this year. 
There were 29 domestic violence-re-
lated deaths in Minnesota last year. 
Yet Federal law does not prohibit abu-
sive dating partners or convicted stalk-
ers from buying a gun, which is a prob-
lem I have been trying to fix since I got 
to Washington. 
We had hearings on this bill. We had 
a hearing in the Judiciary Committee 
years ago where the Republican wit-
nesses agreed that we should close 
what is called the ‘‘boyfriend loop-
hole.’’ As one of the conservative sher-
iffs from Wisconsin testified, he said 
that, basically, mean boyfriends shoot 
just as hard and hit just as hard as 
mean husbands. Yet that discrepancy 
exists in a number of States. 
And what just happened just a few 
weeks 
ago? 
The 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act passed in the House of Rep-
resentatives, 
Senator 
MURPHY. 
It 
passed in the House of Representatives 
with 29 Republican votes, and that pro-
vision is in there. That is now coming 
over to the U.S. Senate, and it has been 
one of the reasons this bill has been 
stalled out. 
I do not know how after what we 
have seen with the numbers of domes-
tic violence cases, after the story I just 
told of a woman we just lost this week-
end, and how after what happened in 
Atlanta, we cannot acknowledge this 
violence against women and, in par-
ticular, against women of color. This is 
one thing that we can do right now. We 
literally can pass that bill as we work 
on background checks and all of the 
other things that we need to do. 
I will end with this, Senator MURPHY, 
that what happened in your State with 
the Sandy Hook shooting is forever 
etched in all of our minds and memo-
ries. When people ask, ‘‘What was your 
best day in the Senate?’’ I talk about a 
bill I passed—maybe little known to 
some—involving a young girl who was 
killed as a result of a swimming pool 
tragedy. We fixed that rule about pools 
at least a few years ago, and no one has 
died since. 
Then they ask about my saddest day. 
For me, it was when the bipartisan 
background check went down, because 
those parents whom Senator MURPHY 
knows so well were in my office, and I 
was one of the several Senators who 
had to tell them ‘‘no’’ even though 
they had had the courage to come be-
fore the Senate. In particular, one 
woman told me that story of waiting in 
the firehouse, waiting as, one by one, 
the kids would come in, and, pretty 
soon, they knew that they would never 
see their little boy again. 
And as she just broke down crying, 
remembering the last thing she had 
seen him do, which was point to the 
picture of the school aide on their re-
frigerator, and as she sat there, crum-
pled on the floor, crying, she thought 
of that aide and thought: She will 
never leave his side. And when they 
found them, shot in the school, that 
woman had her arms around that little 
boy, and they were both shot to death. 
And we all had to look at those fami-
lies and say: You had the courage to 
come forward to fight for a bill that 
wouldn’t have even prevented the kill-
ing of children, but you knew it was 
the best thing to prevent violence 
around the country, and that was back-
ground checks, but the Senate did not 
have the courage to pass it. That time 
has come. The courage must be in all of 
us, and we must get this done. 
Thank you, Senator MURPHY. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise, as 
my colleagues have tonight, to talk 
about gun violence again. It seems that 
only a few months pass, and we are 
here over and over again, talking about 
this uniquely American problem. 
Tonight, we gather in grief—a lot of 
sadness throughout the country, people 
offering, as I do tonight, once again, 
condolences to the families in both the 
State of Georgia, the State of Colo-
rado, and so many others—so many 
other families throughout the country 
who have lost a loved one just in the 
last week or month or within the last 
year. 
But we also, I think, tonight have to 
do more than just offer condolences 
and offer support for the families. We 
have to ask ourselves some basic ques-
tions, and one question that keeps 
coming back every time we gather—at 
least for me it does and, I know, prob-
ably for a lot of Americans—is not sim-
ply why are we not beginning to solve 
this problem, why aren’t we taking ac-
tion. They are obvious questions we all 
ask. But one question that keeps com-
ing to me over and over again is a sim-
ple question about the U.S. Senate: 
Will the U.S. Senate, once again, as it 
has now we can say year after year— 
will the U.S. Senate surrender to gun 
violence? 
That is a question I have been asking 
myself. I have certainly asked it on 
this floor. Will the Senate continue to 
surrender to gun violence? And, by ex-
tension, therefore, the country is not 
taking action when we don’t take ac-
tion. The only way that we can begin 
to solve this problem over time is to 
take action here in the Senate. 
The House has acted over and over 
again, as we know, bill after bill. In a 
larger sense, we have to ask ourselves: 
Is it really true? Will it be true again 
that the most powerful Nation on 
Earth—really, the most powerful Na-
tion in the history of the human race— 
will that Nation once again surrender 
to this problem because of inaction 
here? 
I know this is true in every State in 
the Union, but I certainly know it is 
true in Pennsylvania: The people of my 
home State and the people of America 
expect us to act. They don’t expect us 
to surrender once again to this prob-
lem. They expect us to take action to 
pass commonsense gun measures that 
will, at a minimum, reduce the likeli-
hood that we will have more mass 
shootings like we have experienced just 
in the last week and over and over 
again over months and now years. And 
even—even now we are moving into 
decades of mass casualty events involv-
ing guns. 
So they expect us to act, not to genu-
flect to the gun lobby. And tonight we 
have to ask that question again: Will 
the U.S. Senate surrender to this prob-
lem and, really, by implication, sur-
render and genuflect to the gun lobby? 
Tonight, I know that my colleague 
from Connecticut, Senator MURPHY, 
and others have read through some 
names of victims of gun violence, and I 
will add to that list. It is about 20. 
Just—just a fraction, a tiny fraction, 
of those we lost just in the last couple 
of years from so many different States: 
Kortlin Williams from the State of 
Missouri; Marcus Obrian Young from 
the State of North Carolina; Marquez 
Warden from Virginia; Marvin Scott 
from Maryland; Melvin Porter from 
Georgia; Omar Mohamed Juma from 
Texas; Russell Jones, also from Texas; 
Saveon Th’Marcus Washington from 
the State of Alabama; Angela Thomp-
son from Oklahoma; Stephanie Lee 
from Ohio; Tahjier Lafleur from Cali-
fornia; Teon Burwell from Virginia; 
Xavier Cancer from South Carolina; 
Brenda Sue Strawser Sines, Maryland; 
Tera’Lynn Cantrell from Arkansas; 
Teshundra Fortune from Mississippi; 
Quindarious 
Ford 
from 
Georgia; 
Raemel Richardson from Louisiana; 
Sarah Larocca from Colorado; and, fi-
nally, Andre Odom from Ohio. 
I am not sure it is possible for any 
one of us who hasn’t been—whose fam-
ily has not been a victim of gun vio-
lence to in any way not only under-
stand but even to offer the appropriate 
words that we try to offer to these fam-
ilies on a night like this and on so 
many other days and nights. 
I always turn back to the words of 
others about what this might mean to 
those families. I just can’t even imag-
ine what it would be like to lose a fam-
ily member to gun violence or to any 
violence, for that matter. 
Remember the words of the great re-
cording artist Bruce Springsteen. He 
wrote a song in the aftermath—the 
horror of the aftermath of 9/11, and he 
was trying to capture in a series of 
songs that he wrote and put in an 
album at the time capturing the loss, 
the pain, the pain of the loss that so 
many American families felt at that

time. And I always thought it was ap-
plicable, that kind of loss, to what 
these families feel when a member of 
their family is killed by gun violence. 
Springsteen’s refrain in that song— 
the name of the song is ‘‘You’re Miss-
ing,’’ and he keeps using that refrain: 
You’re missing when I shut out the lights. 
You’re missing when I close my eyes. 
You’re missing when I see the sunrise. 
That is the reality for these families. 
Every moment of their day will be a 
time when they will be missing that 
family member for God only knows 
how long. 
So we are thinking of those families 
tonight who have loved and lost. 
We are also remembering—and this is 
another area where we have not taken 
action—we are also remembering fami-
lies that had a member of their family 
become a victim of gun violence, but 
they survived, but their life is changed 
unalterably. The life of that individual 
has changed. The life of his or her fam-
ily changes and so many burdens they 
have to carry, having survived gun vio-
lence. 
We know that 100 are killed each 
day—more than 40,000 across the coun-
try in our country. But we also know 
numbers about those who have sur-
vived: 230 people sustain a nonfatal gun 
injury every day, and it is estimated 
that about 10 million Americans have 
been shot and injured during their life-
time—10 million Americans. 
We also know that gun violence inju-
ries are more likely to occur in young-
er people. Each year, approximately 
15,600 children and teenagers are shot 
and injured. Black children and teen-
agers are 14 times more likely than 
their White peers to die by gun homi-
cide. 
Those who survive—those huge num-
bers who survive—have their lives 
changed forever. The role that that vic-
tim plays in the family is made expo-
nentially more different. 
I will talk about one of those individ-
uals tonight. His name is Azir Harris. 
Azir Harris was 17 years old in Feb-
ruary of 2018—February 15, to be exact. 
It was the day after the Parkland 
shooting in Florida. Azir was shot five 
times on his way to grab something to 
eat with two of his friends in South 
Philadelphia. 
He was paralyzed from the waist 
down, caught in the crossfire of gun vi-
olence as an innocent bystander. Azir’s 
life and his family’s lives were turned 
upside down in seconds. Their house 
was just blocks away from where he al-
most lost his life—again, as I said, shot 
five times. 
To navigate their two-story home, 
Azir’s father would carry him up and 
down the stairs in their home. They 
searched desperately to relocate but 
were having trouble finding housing, 
which is often nearly impossible for 
victims of gun violence. 
The family was eventually able to re-
locate into a home in North Philadel-
phia, but in the process, they were 
forced to leave behind some of their 
adult children in the old home they 
came from. 
Azir continues to learn about how to 
navigate his new life in a wheelchair, 
and the family continues to struggle to 
find ways to improve his quality of life. 
Now they are searching for housing 
outside of the city so they might be 
able to find a home with a backyard for 
Azir to enjoy. 
Azir and his family will never be able 
to forget about this shooting—and he 
was shot five times—because they live 
with the consequences of that violence 
every single day. They are just one of 
millions who struggle financially, who 
struggle physically, who struggle emo-
tionally because of the trauma of gun 
violence that has ravaged our commu-
nities, our schools, our churches, and 
our businesses. 
So the U.S. Senate has an obligation 
on this part of the problem as well. We 
can’t surrender to gun violence, and we 
can’t surrender to the question of what 
we are going to do to help those who 
survive. 
We certainly have to pass common-
sense gun measures, as I mentioned be-
fore—something as simple and as over-
whelmingly popular as universal back-
ground checks. And at the same time, 
we can pass a number of other com-
monsense measures, including a bill 
that I am leading here in the Senate 
and paired up with U.S. Representative 
DWIGHT EVANS in the House, a great 
leader in our State from the city of 
Philadelphia. This bill is the Resources 
for Victims of Gun Violence, and 
DWIGHT EVANS and I are working to get 
it passed. 
The bill would create an interagency 
advisory council with experts from 
Federal Agencies, victims of gun vio-
lence, and victim assistance profes-
sionals. Among other things, this coun-
cil would make it easier for victims of 
gun violence to access resources by as-
sessing, gathering, and disseminating 
information about different benefits 
and programs that could assist the vic-
tims—the victims of gun violence, like 
Azir and his family. 
But I come back to where I started as 
I conclude my remarks. We have to ask 
that question: Will the U.S. Senate 
once again surrender to gun violence, 
do nothing about the tragic loss of life 
that we have seen just in the last week, 
surrender to the carnage that we see 
not just this week and last week and 
month after month but now literally 
decade after decade? 
There hasn’t been on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate a significant, substantial 
debate on gun violence in I don’t know 
how long; I guess since maybe 2013—8 
years. There has been 8 years of vir-
tually no debate and 8 years of not vot-
ing, not even passing a vote on these 
commonsense gun measures, because 
the gun lobby has created a blockade. 
So the Senate was not even permitted, 
I guess, under their rules—the rules of 
the gun lobby and the rules of the ma-
jority until recently—prohibited from 
even debating, let alone voting on com-
monsense measures. 
So while the victims of gun violence 
are burdened by all the changes in 
their lives and the expense and the 
trauma they live through, while others 
suffer through the consequence of los-
ing a loved one and feeling that sense 
of missing someone every day, while 
all that is happening, the U.S. Senate 
has been frozen in place for 8 years at 
least. We haven’t even voted on com-
monsense measures. 
It is time for the Senate to act, not 
to genuflect to the gun lobby like so 
many in this Chamber seem to want to 
do year after year. It is time for the 
Senate to act, to pass commonsense 
gun reform at long last. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator CASEY for his 
very powerful remarks and all of my 
colleagues for coming to the floor to-
night in this event that Senator MUR-
PHY and I are helping to lead. 
Now I recognize Senator VAN HOLLEN 
of Maryland, a great friend and col-
league who knows a lot about this 
topic. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator BLUMENTHAL, 
Senator MURPHY, and everybody who 
has been brought together by this trag-
edy that we witnessed in our country— 
first a few days ago in Atlanta and 
then Boulder. 
The tragedy is that these are not iso-
lated events; these are the kinds of 
tragedies we see all too often and, in-
deed, every day in neighborhoods and 
streets around our country. So it is im-
portant that we come together to talk 
about the horror of the daily toll of 
gun violence and also highlight the 
horror of the fact that this body and 
the Federal Government have not 
taken action to stop those daily hor-
rors. 
Mr. President, I want to begin by 
joining my colleagues in reading out 
loud the names of 20 of our fellow 
Americans who have perished from gun 
violence just this year, 15 from across 
the country and 5 from my home State 
of Maryland. This is just this year, and 
this is just a few of those who have 
been shot down through gun violence: 
Caleb Day of Ohio, age 19; Cody Nichols 
Campbell of Indiana, age 27; Alex Jack-
son of New Mexico, age 15; Gregory 
Dewayne Lynn Chandler of Texas, age 
32; Debra Derrick of New Jersey, age 
63; Jason B. West, of North Carolina, 
age 36; Jeremiah Lowery of Louisiana, 
age 17; Caleb Martin of South Carolina, 
age 18; Lavontae Sharron Johnson of 
Virginia, age 23; Holly Elizabeth Beard 
Montana of Alabama, March 11, 2021, 
age 51; Jessica Ruiz of Texas, age 20; 
Najeebat Sule of Pennsylvania, age 24; 
Ricardo M. Lopez of New York, age 37; 
Richard Douglas Sloane of Kentucky, 
age 33; and Tyree Riley of Indiana, age 
18. 
In Maryland, my State of Maryland, 
just this year: April Renee Lawson, age

18; Genesis Garrett, age 22; Terry Wil-
liams, age 18; Ken Gerstley, age 50; and 
Guy Thomas, age 52. 
We read these names tonight and re-
member these lives because it is impor-
tant to pay tribute to those whom we 
have lost, but it is also to make sure 
that tonight is not the end of their 
story and that we dedicate ourselves to 
turning words into action here in the 
Senate. 
Our country is now experiencing an 
upswing in gun violence, the largest in-
crease in gun violence since 1960. Be-
tween the years 2019 and 2020, we have 
seen that big jump, and it should hor-
rify everyone and give us pause and 
cause us to reflect. 
I have been texting back and forth in 
the last few days after the shootings in 
Atlanta and Boulder with a friend of 
mine whom I first met two decades 
ago. Her name is Carole Price. I met 
her under the most tragic of cir-
cumstances. Carole and her husband 
John lost their beloved 13-year-old son 
John to gun violence. Their beautiful 
13-year-old boy John went next door to 
play at a neighbor’s house. There was a 
loose gun, and it was an accidental 
shooting. John died. He was 13 years 
old. 
Like so many other parents or loved 
ones of victims of shooting deaths, Car-
ole had the courage to take her pain, 
take her tragedy, and work to try to 
make sure that kind of pain and trag-
edy didn’t happen to another family in 
the State of Maryland or in the coun-
try. She did what was within her 
power. 
At the time, I was in the Maryland 
Legislature, and she came and im-
plored the Maryland Legislature to do 
something—something to prevent this 
kind of horrible tragedy from being ex-
perienced by other Maryland families, 
and the legislature acted. Maryland be-
came the first State in the country at 
that time to require that guns sold in 
our State have embedded trigger locks, 
safety locks, so that if they were left 
lying around, it would be less likely 
that some 13-year-old boy or girl would 
pick it up and shoot their friend. That 
bill saved lives in Maryland, and that 
is because of Carole Price. 
Think of what is happening today in 
our country. The pandemic hit. What 
did we do? We worked to follow the ad-
vice of public health experts—social 
distance, wear masks—and we went 
into overdrive. We went into overdrive 
to develop a vaccine to stop the deaths. 
When it comes to the epidemic of gun 
violence, we see no such actions being 
taken here at the Federal level. The 
normal thing to do would be to do what 
the Maryland State Legislature did in 
response to that tragedy Carole Price 
went through—try to take some action 
to prevent other families from experi-
encing that tragedy. 
When Carole texted me the other 
day, it was just another reminder that 
the pain of losing a loved one to gun vi-
olence never goes away. In fact, that 
pain comes back again and again when 
we see these mass shootings, and it 
comes back and again when Carole 
Price reads about another boy or girl 
or another person who died from gun 
violence in their home. Again, we see it 
on a daily basis. 
The reason it is so important that we 
come together and focus on this is that 
there are some, I think, in our country 
who have lost the capacity to be sur-
prised. I know we were all shocked and 
surprised after Columbine, after Sandy 
Hook, after the Pulse nightclub and 
the Mother Emanuel AME shootings, 
maybe the shooting in Las Vegas. We 
were shocked at some point in the past 
that people would indiscriminately 
take the lives of others. We were 
shocked at the daily toll of gun vio-
lence. Even if it was in a place like 
Baltimore or another city in Maryland 
and it didn’t make the national news, 
it still was a shocking thing that some-
body would just gun down a fellow 
human being. But now when we see it 
happen time and again, mass shootings 
and the daily toll, nobody can claim 
surprise. What is surprising is that, as 
a nation, we haven’t summoned the 
will to do something about it the same 
way we have worked to summon the 
will to defeat the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
In 2019, 757 Marylanders died from 
gun violence. In fact, it has become so 
routine that by this time tomorrow, on 
the current trajectory, 2 more—2 more 
Marylanders will have died from gun 
violence. That is 1 State out of our 50 
States. This is something that tears at 
the fabric of communities in our coun-
try. It has had a disproportionate im-
pact and pain on communities of color. 
I want to tell my colleagues about 
Denise Reid, who knows what it is like 
to carry the burden and pain of losing 
loved ones to gun violence. Denise grew 
up in Baltimore. She lost her uncle to 
gun violence. She lost her cousin to 
gun violence. She lost her cousin’s 
girlfriend to gun violence. Her mother 
was shot standing in the doorway of 
their Baltimore home. Thankfully, she 
survived. In October 2006, Denise’s son 
Tavon was shot and gravely wounded, 
paralyzed from the neck down. He sur-
vived his injury for 3 years but passed 
away after that. 
So tonight, I ask all of us to pay trib-
ute to Denise and to her son Tavon 
Terrell Water, Sr., who was gone too 
soon, but I want to tell you about 
Denise because she is an inspiration to 
us all. She still lives in Baltimore. She 
works as the chaplain with the Balti-
more City Police, working every day to 
serve her community and give back to 
the city she loves but wants to make 
better and safer. 
My State of Maryland has thankfully 
joined Denise and Carole Price and all 
those who have lost someone to gun vi-
olence by passing commonsense meas-
ures in our State of Maryland. But the 
State of Maryland, like every other 
State, is not an island. We can’t do it 
alone. We need for the Congress to take 
action. 
If you look at guns that were used in 
Maryland in crimes, 54 percent of them 
come from outside of the State of 
Maryland, from States that do not 
have those kinds of commonsense gun 
laws that make people safe. 
So, Maryland, like so many other 
States, is calling upon our brothers and 
sisters from across the Union to help 
us take action, and we know that the 
public believes and understands that 
too. Some of my colleagues have said 
90 percent of the American public sup-
ports basic background checks for peo-
ple purchasing guns. 
I want to tell my colleagues about 
Michael Derrick Baughan, who was 
born March 18, 1983, excelled in school 
throughout his life. He went to college 
in Maryland, and then he moved to 
Delaware. His mother Cheryl remem-
bers picking up the phone one day and 
hearing her son at other end of the line 
saying: Mom, I went to Walmart and 
got a gun in 15 minutes. I can’t get a 
driver’s license that fast, but I got a 
gun because I am feeling pain, and I 
have a gun to my head. 
Cheryl and Michael spoke on the 
phone for 2 hours before Michael agreed 
to take the bullets out of his gun. But 
that wasn’t the last time he made an 
attempt, and Michael died of suicide, 
gunshot, February 2014. 
Whether it is the ease of getting a 
gun to commit suicide or the ease of 
getting a gun to shoot down others, 
what we have in the country today is 
simply unacceptable. As Daniel Web-
ster, who is a public health researcher 
at Johns Hopkins University of Mary-
land, said: Gun violence is not inevi-
table. It is very preventable. 
We know that. We know there are 
things we can do to prevent gun vio-
lence. I am not going to go into a lit-
any of legislation that we could pass to 
make things better. I do want to point 
out, though, that we have an organiza-
tion, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives—the ATF, as 
it is commonly referred to—whose job 
it is, who is charged with protecting 
the public from the illegal use of traf-
ficking of firearms. And yet, while we 
give them that charge, we give them 
that responsibility, the House and the 
Senate, over the years, have tied their 
hands. We have handcuffed them. We 
made it very difficult for them to do 
their job. We prevent them from shar-
ing trace crime gun data on firearms 
with the public and on people doing re-
search into the gun violence epidemic. 
We bar the ATF from legally requiring 
gun dealers to keep accurate inven-
tories of their guns and report lost or 
stolen firearms. Simple things like 
that that we say they can’t do. 
I want to end by talking about an 
initiative of the mayor of Baltimore 
City, Mayor Brandon Scott, who has 
worked with Everytown, the organiza-
tion, to create a cutting-edge internal 
system to help law enforcement track 
and understand and disrupt the stream 
of firearms entering the city of Balti-
more. They have worked hard to try to

overcome these obstacles that we put 
in the way of ATF. But that is a chal-
lenge, and it shouldn’t be so hard. 
We had a program in the city of Bal-
timore—still do. It is called Safe 
Streets. It is headed by a person called 
Dante Barksdale. He went by the name 
of ‘‘Tater.’’ He was known throughout 
Baltimore as the smiling face of Safe 
Streets, which was a gun violence pre-
vention program. 
Dante was committed to the mission. 
He helped others learn to put down 
their guns. Dante was shot to death on 
January 17 of this year. In that mo-
ment, Maryland lost a son, a mentor, a 
hero, and as Mayor Scott called him, a 
man who saved thousands of lives in 
our city, thousands of lives, and yet his 
was taken by gun violence—gun vio-
lence that is preventable. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, Member 
after Member has come down tonight 
to speak, and the conversation, as we 
all have come down here, was to come 
do something that I think is extraor-
dinarily poignant. 
This is the floor where policy is de-
bated and where ideas of governance 
are discussed. It is a deliberative body, 
but we are in a democracy, and we rep-
resent people. So, tonight, the idea was 
that we would come down here and 
talk about people, but the pain is that 
they are not alive; that we would dis-
cuss the deceased, the dead, the mur-
dered, the killed. 
I believe that if America has not bro-
ken your heart, then you don’t love her 
enough. Name after name tonight has 
been spoken by colleague after col-
league, and, dear God, every single 
name is a son or daughter. It is a 
brother or sister. It is a family mem-
ber. They are a person, part of a com-
munity, and they are dead. 
But this is not just any limited list. 
It seems to grow like a cancer on the 
soul of our country. You take my age, 
51 years old. Well, in just the time of 
my life, the death in our country has 
been something like has never before 
been seen in even a country at war be-
cause the people who have died, the 
human beings who have been lost, the 
family members who have been slain, 
their total number, in just my lifetime, 
add up to more than all of the Ameri-
cans who have died in every single war 
from the Revolution to our current 
wars in the Middle East. 
So my friends and my colleagues 
have read name after name after name, 
but the painful, heartbreaking reality 
is we could have taken hour after hour 
over days after days to name the total 
who have died in my lifetime. And the 
heartbreaking stories have to stagger 
you when you hear the testimony. On 
March 1, Kaiden Alex Peak, who was 4 
years old, and his brother, Mayson 
Paul Peak, who was 3 years old, were 
gunned down, killed in Warsaw, MO. 
Jennifer Garcia, 21 years of age, and 
Charlie Borbon Lopez, 20 years, both 
killed in Portland, OR. Say their 
names. Say their names. Say their 
names. 
Cobe Hilliard, 19, killed in Temple, 
TX. April Williams, 21, and her mom 
Tammy Briggs, 46, killed in Augusta, 
GA. Say their names. Say their names. 
Christine Ruffin, age 61, was killed 
with a gun in Palm City, FL. Delquan 
Daniels, 23 years old, was killed with a 
gun in Rochester, NY. Say their names. 
Say their names. 
Gerson Aleman Velasquez, 19, was 
killed with a gun in Myrtle Beach, SC. 
Lionel Darling, age 39, and Rayneesha 
Dotson, age 30, were both killed with 
guns—killed 
with 
guns. 
Say 
their 
name. Say their name. 
Maritza Remijio Paniagua, age 20, 
was killed with a gun in Los Angeles. 
Merlyn McCallister, age 51, was killed 
with a gun in Chicago. Mishealia Marie 
Meredith, age 19, was killed with a gun 
in Eldorado, IL. Victor Brooks, age 20, 
was killed with a gun in Phoenix, AZ. 
Ronald Jeffery Laroy Jones, Jr., age 25, 
was killed with a gun in Columbus, OH. 
Say their names. Say their names. 
This is the question of our country. 
What is the quality of our mercy? How 
courageous is our empathy? How des-
titute is our compassion? How anemic 
is our love for one another that this 
many Americans are dying hour after 
hour, day after day, month after 
month, year after year? Carnage in our 
country like never before seen in hu-
manity, and we do nothing as a society 
and a government that was formed for 
a more perfect Union, for domestic 
tranquility, and for justice. At the top 
of our Federal Government’s Constitu-
tion is the very ideal that we are for 
the common defense. Say their names. 
Do we honor them? Do we love their 
survivors? Love is not sentimentality. 
It is not words. It demands something. 
It necessitates sacrifice. And I can tell 
you I am one of those folks who, serv-
ing in an American city, would have 
my police officers show me the films of 
murders from our cameras—human 
beings being shot and killed. How could 
it not shake the core of your soul? How 
could it not rip open wounds that can-
not be healed? 
My colleagues reading names of peo-
ple, children lost, kids lost to suicide, 
bodies mangled, people paralyzed, how 
could it not call to your conscience? 
How could it not demand from all of us 
not to sit idly by and watch and wit-
ness? We are wounded as a society. We 
are hurting. There is pain that is 
unspoken, and that is so dangerous. 
In 2018, Shahad Smith, I knew him 
well. I used to live in high-rise projects 
at the top of my block. There was a 
group of boys there, led by this young 
man named Hassan Washington. Has-
san was brilliant. He was funny. He had 
a sharp wit. He had charisma. Shahad 
was one of the young men in high 
school who hung out with him in the 
lobby of my building. I would come 
home and I would see them there. 
And I tell you, in 2018, I make it to 
the U.S. Senate, and I get a call from 
Jimmy Wright, a police officer from 
those buildings who—he is a beautiful 
man, and he was shaken. They killed 
Shahad on my block, where I live as a 
U.S. Senator, at the top of my block, 
and I will never forget how Jimmy de-
scribed it. He said: CORY, I talked to 
the police officer. He was killed with 
an assault rifle. And he said: CORY, the 
police officer told me his head ex-
ploded. 
And I—I had to hold onto something 
because most of those kids from that 
lobby, the children I watched grow up 
in my 8 years living in those projects, 
in those buildings, Black boys in a 
world where there is so much assault— 
the first of them to die. 
In 2005, I would come home at night. 
I was chasing my dream to be the 
mayor of the largest city in my State. 
I was getting ready to run for office, 
and I came home and I smelled mari-
juana in the lobby. 
Now, we live in a country where it is 
a lot different watching kids at Stan-
ford, Yale smoke pot and have no wor-
ries. But for inner city Black kids, I 
will tell you right now, they have no 
margins for experimentation. And I 
said to myself: Oh, I have to intervene 
here. So I started asking them: Let’s 
get out of this lobby. Let’s go do some-
thing. Let’s go to the movies. Let’s eat. 
And I will never forget. I made a mis-
take, y’all. I said: You guys choose a 
movie. That was a mistake because 
they took me to something called 
‘‘Saw II.’’ Do not see that movie. 
And we went out to dinner at a diner, 
Andrew’s Diner. I remember the con-
versations with them. I asked them 
what their dreams were. And this 
moved me because their dreams, they 
were humble dreams. 
And I said that I would connect them 
with mentors, and I had all these plans 
about how to help these young men get 
out of the danger zone. Then I got too 
busy with my campaign. And I remem-
ber feeling a little guilty that I was too 
busy to follow through on the commit-
ments I had made. And I consoled my-
self that I was running for mayor: 
When I become mayor, God, I will be 
able to help all children in the city. I 
will step up then. Let me just get 
through the campaign. 
Well, I would still come home at 
night, and the boys weren’t mad at me 
or anything like that. They would still 
greet me and cheer me on when I came 
into the lobby, Shahad and Hassan. It 
was amazing. They would lift me up. 
One day they had lawn signs, my 
lawn signs, waving them, and formed a 
parade line. And I walked out and 
waved and got in the elevator until I 
realized, where did they get those lawn 
signs from? They are kind of expensive. 
I ended up winning. And I had death 
threats on me. And when you are elect-
ed to office, get death threats, you 
have security. And next thing you 
know, I had police officers stationed in 
the lobby, and the boys weren’t there 
anymore. They didn’t want to hang out 
where the police officers were.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1759 
March 24, 2021 
And I didn’t think too much about it 
because I was running at full speed as 
a new mayor. I was 36, 37 years old. The 
violent crime in our city was peaking. 
There were too many shooters in that 
hot summer. I will never forget. And I 
would run to every street corner I 
could where there was a shooting in 
our city. And I would stand there, and 
I would say: This is not who we are. 
This is not America. This is not New-
ark. We are going to overcome this. 
And I would give street-level sermons 
telling people about the vision for our 
city. And, God, we would eventually 
turn down the violence. 
But in those early days, a month into 
my office, I show up on a street corner, 
and there is a body covered by a sheet 
and another one being loaded on the 
back of an ambulance. And I barely 
paid attention to the humanity on the 
street. I didn’t even ask for the names. 
I was too busy ministering to the liv-
ing. 
I get home that night to steal a cou-
ple hours of sleep in my early days as 
mayor. And I will never forget sitting 
in my bedroom with my BlackBerry, 
going through it, and I saw the name 
on the homicide report. At that mo-
ment in my life, something broke in 
me that will never fix. It wasn’t an 
anonymous name that I didn’t know. It 
wasn’t just a cold issuance of another 
crime in a big city. The name was Has-
san Washington. Four floors below me 
he lived with his grandma, a kid I 
promised to help with his dreams. 
I will never forget his funeral for as 
long as I live. Perry’s Funeral Home— 
God bless them, those professionals. I 
entered that funeral home as the newly 
minted mayor. And I was so upset when 
I saw it was in their basement room be-
cause going in that room was like de-
scending into the bowel of a ship, a 
narrow staircase. And I get into this 
room. We were piled in on top of each 
other like we were chained together in 
grief, and people were crying. Every-
body was showing up. Everybody was 
there for what is an American tradi-
tion: almost every day, another boy, 
another Black boy in a box killed by a 
gun. 
And I wish I could tell you that I was 
strong in that moment. I wish I could 
tell you that I was mayoral, that I was 
a leader and the father of a city, but I 
wasn’t. I felt shame. I felt hurt. I felt 
embarrassment. 
I tried to lean on other people in that 
room. There were folk I had known for 
years, but, finally, I had enough. I had 
to run. I left there. I jumped in my 
SUV, drove to my new office in City 
Hall. And for the first time—not the 
last but for the first time as the mayor 
of New Jersey’s great and largest city, 
I sat in that office, and I wept over a 
dead boy. And all I could think about 
was climbing through the feelings of 
shame and hurt and pain. All I could 
think about was that funeral in that 
basement room, packed full of people. 
All of us were there for his death, but 
where were we for his life? 
What a morbid thing we have been 
doing here tonight, reading the names 
of dead people killed in our country, 
hoping that somehow—somehow we 
could change. Well, I will tell you this 
right now: We are in a distraught mo-
ment in our Nation, where most of us 
agree on solid steps. It won’t solve all 
the problems, but it would make a dif-
ference. It would save a Hassan. It 
would save a Shahad. It would save the 
3- and 4-year-olds, the names I have 
read. 
The question is, How courageous are 
we? How much do we truly love one an-
other? What will we do? This is a mo-
ment in American history that could 
be the inflection point. If we act now, 
we could end some of this nightmare. If 
we fail to do anything, we will be back 
here again. The list of the dead will be 
longer. The heartache and the pain and 
the wounds and the grief and the sor-
row and the shame will be deeper in 
America, the world’s greatest country. 
We must demand of each other a 
greater love. We must end the poverty 
of empathy. We must free ourselves 
from this prison, from this dungeon. 
We must release ourselves from these 
chains. We must demand that this Na-
tion be the Nation we want it to be, be 
the Nation we hope it should be, be the 
Nation that those in military uniform 
died for—a nation where we make real 
the greatest principles of humanity, 
the greatest calling of every faith that 
there is—not words, but real, true, 
manifestation of the principle and the 
call. 
Will we be silent? Will we be igno-
rant? Will we avoid? Will we do noth-
ing? Will we be passive? Or will we 
truly be a nation that loves one an-
other? 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, Marcia 
Reitman Currie from New York; Mitch-
ell Wright, Jr., from Missouri; Nicholas 
Tarpley from Pennsylvania; Reuben 
Lewis 
III 
from 
California; 
Rhyce 
Wingate-Bey, 
Maryland; 
Robert 
Crochiere, Massachusetts; Samuel La-
mont 
Smith-Williams, 
Tennessee; 
Spencer 
Wilcox, 
Oregon; 
Anthony 
Castillo, New York—we didn’t come 
close to finishing this list tonight. We 
didn’t make a dent in the list of those 
names of the people who have died 
from gun violence in 2021 alone, a year 
in which almost 10,000 people have died 
in less than 3 months in suicides and 
homicides and accidental shootings. 
It is a choice. None of this is inevi-
table. Almost all of it is preventable. It 
only happens here in the United States 
of America because other countries 
make different choices. 
Congress goes the next 2 weeks on a 
district work period. We wanted to 
come to the floor tonight to make 
clear that we are not going to forget 
those who have died through the inac-
tion of this body, their national lead-
ers; that we are going to renew our 
commitment to be better and to 
change and to begin that process in the 
wake of the shootings in Boulder and 
Atlanta by making sure that every-
body hears the names of those who 
have died. 
I yield to Senator BLUMENTHAL to 
wrap up for the evening. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
there is no last word tonight. There is 
no final saying here. There are no final 
names. 
Nora 
Beller, 
Tito 
Roman, 
Aaliyah Eubanks, Dominick Boston, 
Brad Keel, James Ray Huddelston—we 
could be here a long time. But the trag-
edy is there will be more names, 100 
more, at this time tomorrow night. 
And every one of these names is a fu-
ture cut short. Every one of them is a 
life that could have given so much, 
bringing more light and joy, pride, 
grace, dignity. 
My colleagues have come to the floor 
with great eloquence. I want to thank 
them. But the most eloquent part to-
night is the names. And we should take 
inspiration from the courage of their 
families, the strength of the survivors, 
advocates, and activists who are form-
ing a political movement that is cre-
ating ripples turning into waves that 
will overcome. They will overcome the 
intransigence and cowardice of col-
leagues who fail to heed the American 
public, and they will be held account-
able. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
clock struck 12, and the chaos of whis-
tles, bells, and sirens echoed down 
Michigan Avenue. All across Chicago, 
you could hear—feel—the jubilance 
erupting in the streets. Women of all 
ages sat on the hoods of Studebakers 
and Model Ts, waving American flags 
as they rode through The Loop in cele-
bration. 
A decades-long fight for equality had 
finally come to an end. Just days ear-
lier, on August 26, 1920, U.S. Secretary 
of State Bainbridge Colby had issued a 
proclamation. The 19th Amendment 
had been ratified, and women in Amer-
ica had secured the right to vote, once 
and for all. And though this victory 
was monumental, America still had a 
long way to go. 
Nearly a century later, on the morn-
ing of Saturday, November 7, 2020,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1760 
March 24, 2021 
jubilance once again erupted in the 
streets of Chicago. Drivers honked 
their horns all along Michigan Avenue, 
while passengers leaned out of their 
windows, waving American flags. Joe 
Biden had finally been declared the vic-
tor of the 2020 Presidential election, his 
running mate: KAMALA
HARRIS, the 
first 
African-American 
and 
first 
woman Vice President of the United 
States. The scene in Chicago was a fit-
ting tribute to the 100th anniversary of 
the 19th Amendment’s ratification. 
This 
month, 
America 
celebrates 
Women’s History Month. And the peo-
ple of my State are proud of the lead-
ing role Illinois has played in Amer-
ica’s long struggle for gender equality. 
In 2018, Illinois lawmakers ratified the 
Equal Rights Amendment. Our State 
attorney general, along with the attor-
neys general of two other States, is 
now pressing in Federal court for the 
ERA to be officially recognized as the 
28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion, as it should be. 
We are proud of the remarkable 
women our State has produced. Some 
were Illinoisans by birth, others by 
choice. They include Ida B. Wells, the 
courageous 
journalist, 
anti-lynching 
leader, and suffragist; Jane Addams, 
the first American woman to win the 
Nobel Peace Prize and a cofounder of 
the Hull House, a Chicago landmark; 
Mamie Till Mobley, a mother who 
forced the world to reckon with the 
brutality of racism when she opened 
the casket of her only son, Emmett; 
Betty Friedan, author of ‘‘The Femi-
nine Mystique,’’ a book that inspired a 
new 
wave 
of 
American 
feminism; 
Gwendolyn Brooks, poet laureate of Il-
linois from 1968 until her death in 2000 
and the first Black woman inducted 
into the American Academy of Arts 
and Letters; Sandra Cisneros, a re-
nowned writer and educator whose 
work is taught in classrooms across 
the country; Jeanne Gang, a world- 
class architect whose work graces the 
skyline of Chicago, including the tall-
est building in the world designed by a 
woman, the St. Regis Chicago; Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, 
one 
of 
the 
world’s 
greatest track and field athletes and 
the founder of the Jackie Joyner- 
Kersee Foundation, which offers ath-
letic and educational programming to 
kids in my hometown of East St. 
Louis, IL; Precious Brady-Davis, an en-
vironmentalist and transgender woman 
who has shed light on the experiences 
of transgender parents; Oprah Winfrey, 
the host of a daytime talk show you 
may have heard of—her career as a 
talk show host actually began on 
‘‘A.M. Chicago’’; Hillary Clinton, the 
first woman to be nominated for Presi-
dent by a major political party, she 
may have represented New York in the 
U.S. Senate, but her roots are firmly 
planted in Park Ridge, IL; Michelle 
Obama, another former First Lady who 
broke barriers—she is the pride of Chi-
cago’s South Side, and I am grateful to 
call her a friend; and my colleague in 
this body, Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
an American hero. 
In 2018, the people of Illinois elected 
Juliana Stratton as our 48th Lieuten-
ant Governor, the first woman of color 
ever elected to hold a constitutional 
office in our State. She is a dynamo 
and part of a new generation of women 
who are taking their rightful place as 
political leaders in our Nation. In the 
2020 elections, women across America 
turned out in historic numbers, and 
voters elected a record number of 
women to higher office. 
But we still have a long way to go. 
America lags well behind other devel-
oped nations when it comes to gender 
equality in our government. Women ac-
count for fewer than 30 percent of our 
representatives in either Chamber of 
Congress. Countries like Finland, Swe-
den, and New Zealand are far closer to 
50 percent, meaning complete gender 
parity. 
So it is certainly welcome news that 
President Biden has nominated 12 
women for Cabinet and Cabinet-level 
positions, including Janet Yellen, the 
first female Secretary of Treasury, and 
Congresswoman DEB
HAALAND, who 
would be the first Native American to 
ever serve as a Cabinet Secretary. 
While the past year has been one of 
historic triumph for women, it has also 
been one of unprecedented challenge. 
The pandemic has disproportionately 
devastated women. In December, the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 
that the United States lost 140,000 jobs 
in a single month. A staggering num-
ber that is even worse than it seems, 
women accounted for every single one 
of those job losses. Men, meanwhile, 
managed to gain 16,000 jobs that 
month. 
Working 
women, 
and 
especially 
working women of color, have been 
hardest hit by this pandemic. When 
schools across the country were forced 
to shut their doors, these women were 
thrust into the dual roles of bread-
winner and primary caregiver. They 
shouldered the burden of keeping our 
families and children safe. This is es-
sential work. And just as frontline 
workers need PPE to safely do their 
jobs, working mothers need economic 
relief to do theirs. 
That is what the American Rescue 
Plan President Biden signed into law 
this month delivers. It expands the 
child tax credit, offering up to $3,600 
per child; it invests in our families, by 
increasing the value of SNAP benefits 
and expanding childcare assistance; 
and it gives every working American 
$1,400. The American Rescue Plan will 
help working mothers weather this 
once-in-a-century public health and 
economic crisis. 
After a year of COVID lockdowns and 
losses, America is finally beginning to 
feel a sense of hope that the end of this 
pandemic is coming, and looking at the 
headlines, it is hard not to share that 
optimism. 
Under President Biden, we are vacci-
nating more than 2 million Americans 
a day. As of last week, more people in 
the United States have been fully vac-
cinated than our total number of 
coronavirus cases since the beginning 
of the pandemic. By the beginning of 
summer, we should have a large enough 
supply of vaccines to inoculate every 
adult in America. This is one of the 
greatest scientific feats in modern his-
tory. 
A major reason we were able to de-
velop COVID–19 vaccines at such light-
ning-fast speed is because of the pio-
neering research conducted over dec-
ades by a brilliant scientist, one of the 
unsung heroes of our world. Her name 
is Katalin Kariko´. Like many Amer-
ican heroes, she is an immigrant. She 
began her research in a lab in Hungary, 
when it was still under Communist 
rule. Back then, she believed that syn-
thetic messenger RNA could hold the 
key to treating some of the world’s 
most debilitating diseases. 
She followed that dream across con-
tinents, immigrating to the United 
States in the 1980s. But people—and, 
let’s be honest, men—doubted her at 
every turn. Her grants were rejected. 
She faced demotions. She was even 
threatened with deportation. One of 
the few institutions that supported 
Katalin’s work was the National Insti-
tutes of Health. The experts at NIH 
didn’t just follow the science; they sup-
ported 
the 
visionary 
behind 
the 
science. And that investment paid off. 
Her research into messenger RNA even-
tually blazed a trail for the Moderna 
and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which 
are helping curb the spread of COVID– 
19 at this very moment. 
As we turn the corner of this pan-
demic, let us remember that it was not 
a miracle that got us here. It was 
science. It was dedication. It was the 
work 
of 
trailblazers 
like 
Katalin 
Kariko´. 
As I mentioned, Betty Friedan is one 
of the great women leaders to come out 
of Illinois. In her seminal work, ‘‘The 
Feminine Mystique,’’ she asked: ‘‘Who 
knows what women can be when they 
are finally free to become themselves?’’ 
As we celebrate women’s history, let 
us also renew our commitment to in-
vesting in women’s futures. Who knows 
how many Katalin Kariko´s are out 
there, ready to change the world? 
For our own good, for the good of hu-
mankind, let’s ensure every woman has 
an opportunity to ‘‘become them-
selves.’’ 
f 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as a 
Member of Congress, I have cast a 
number of important votes over the 
years, votes on whether to send our Na-
tion’s brave servicemembers to war or 
to impeach a President, but perhaps 
the most important vote I have ever 
cast was 11 years ago this week, in sup-
port of the Affordable Care Act. 
Since the law’s passage in 2010, the 
ACA has provided health insurance to 
more than 23 million Americans, in-
cluding nearly 1 million Illinoisans. 
That is almost 1 out of every 20 people

March 24, 2021 
living in my home State. Thanks to 
the ACA, they are now covered. That 
measure was called the Affordable Care 
Act for a reason: It is estimated to 
have saved every family in America 
about $4,000 in health insurance pre-
miums. 
I don’t think any of us could have 
predicted 11 years ago just how impor-
tant the protections it guaranteed to 
Americans would become. Then came 
the coronavirus. In the year since the 
pandemic was declared, the virus has 
claimed more than half a million 
American lives. That is more than the 
number of American lives lost in World 
War I, World War II, and the Vietnam 
war combined. 
We grieve with every family who has 
suffered a loss, and we know there are 
millions more Americans who have 
been affected by the virus. Thirty mil-
lion of our family members, friends, 
colleagues, and neighbors have been di-
agnosed with COVID–19. That is 30 mil-
lion Americans who are now living 
with a preexisting condition. We have 
heard stories about the so-called long- 
haulers, individuals who report they 
are 
still 
having 
health 
problems 
months after their original diagnosis. 
They are struggling with shortness of 
breath, trouble sleeping, severe fa-
tigue, and other symptoms that NIH 
Director 
Dr. 
Francis 
Collins 
has 
deemed a ‘‘significant public health 
concern.’’ 
These Americans have enough to 
worry about as it is with their recov-
ery; could you imagine if they also had 
to worry about being able qualify for 
health coverage? In a world without 
the ACA, they would have. Before the 
ACA was the law of the land, people 
could be denied health coverage or 
charged significantly higher premiums 
for having diabetes or asthma—even 
acne. 
Could you imagine if this pandemic 
hit before we passed that law? The tens 
of millions of Americans who would 
have to wonder how they were going to 
pay for their care, their children’s care, 
in the middle of a pandemic? 
Thanks to the ACA, they are covered. 
It has been a lifeline for millions of 
Americans, like Michelle Crifasi, one of 
my neighbors in Springfield, IL. Re-
cently, Michelle wrote to me about 
what the ACA has meant for her and 
her family. For much of her life, 
Michelle was burdened with an un-
known illness, until she was finally di-
agnosed with common variable im-
mune deficiency in her mid-thirties. It 
is a rare condition that limits the im-
mune system’s ability to fight infec-
tion. The diagnosis was bittersweet. 
While she could finally begin to under-
stand and treat her condition, she later 
learned that she had passed it down to 
her daughter. Her husband also devel-
oped it after undergoing cancer treat-
ment. 
The good news is that Michelle and 
her 
family 
have 
health 
insurance 
through her employer, and because of 
the Affordable Care Act, this employer- 
based health plan can no longer deny 
Michelle health coverage or charge her 
higher premiums because she has a pre-
existing condition. Her insurer can no 
longer impose annual or lifetime caps 
on her care. It can’t cut her off right 
when she needs healthcare the most. 
Michelle’s daughter, Meredith, a junior 
at the University of Illinois-Spring-
field, is able to stay on her parents’ 
plan until age 26. Because of the ACA, 
Michelle’s health plan must cover her 
family’s prescription drug costs. 
Without insurance coverage, treating 
common variable immune deficiency 
can cost patients more than $100,000 a 
year. Put simply, these protections 
were not in place before the Affordable 
Care Act, and Michelle and her family 
are alive today because of these protec-
tions. This family’s story is proof that 
the ACA is one of the greatest legisla-
tive accomplishments in modern Amer-
ican history, and it is also proof that 
there is a lot more we can do to protect 
people like her and her family. 
While Michelle is grateful for the 
ACA, she recently told me that ‘‘I feel 
there is more work to be done.’’ And 
she is right, which is why we fought, as 
part of the American Rescue Plan, to 
expand health insurance subsidies and 
eligibility for plans covered under the 
ACA. These provisions will ensure that 
no enrollee spends more than 8.5 per-
cent of their income on health insur-
ance premiums. The typical 60-year-old 
couple in Illinois could see their pre-
miums reduced by $1,300. 
The ARP also increases eligibility for 
premium subsidies to working-class 
American families earning more than 
400 percent of the Federal poverty 
level. 
Outside of the ARP, the Biden-Harris 
administration has taken other steps 
to bolster the ACA, like creating a spe-
cial open enrollment period and ensur-
ing that the DOJ defends the law in the 
case before the Supreme Court. All of 
this is welcome news, and I look for-
ward to working with the Biden-Harris 
administration 
to 
accomplish 
even 
more. That is why we not only cele-
brate the historic passage of the ACA 
but all of the lives it has saved as well. 
After years of unrelenting, unjusti-
fied attacks on this critical piece of 
legislation, we are finally in a position 
to build on it. I am ready to work with 
the Biden-Harris administration to cre-
ate a public option, lower prescription 
drug prices, and address racial and eth-
nic disparities in our healthcare sys-
tem. 
After 11 years since its passage, I am 
proud to declare: The ACA is here to 
stay. 
And here in Congress, we will con-
tinue working to perfect it.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Korea–AGM–114R Hellfire Missiles 
The Republic of Korea (ROK) has requested 
to buy two hundred eighty-eight (288) AGM– 
114R Hellfire missiles. Also included are 
AGM–114R spare parts; U.S. Government and 
contractor engineering, technical, and logis-
tics support services; repair and return; stor-
age; and other related elements of logistical 
and program support. The estimated total 
cost is $36 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by meeting the legitimate 
security and defense needs of one of the clos-
est allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The 
ROK is one of the major political and eco-
nomic powers in East Asia and the Western 
Pacific and a key partner of the United 
States in ensuring peace and stability in 
that region. It is vital to U.S. national inter-
ests to assist the ROK in developing and 
maintaining a strong and ready self-defense 
capability. 
The ROK intends to use these Hellfire mis-
siles to supplement its existing missile capa-
bility and current weapon inventory for its 
AH–64E aircraft. The proposed sale will im-
prove the ROK’s capability to meet current 
and future threats and ensure interoper-
ability with other AGM–114R Hellfire missile 
users in the region. The Republic of Korea 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation, Orlando, FL. The pur-
chaser typically requests offsets. Any offset 
agreements will be defined in negotiations 
between the purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Republic of Korea. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–31 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AGM–114R is used against heavy and 
light armored targets, thin skinned vehicles, 
urban structures, bunkers, caves and per-
sonnel. The missile is Inertial Measurement 
Unit (IMU) based, with a variable delay fuse, 
improved safety and reliability. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware or software elements, the informa-
tion could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Republic of Korea can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S. 
Government. This proposed sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Republic of Korea.

STOP ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN 
FIREARMS ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier 
this week, I joined Senator LEAHY in 
introducing the Stop Illegal Traf-
ficking in Firearms Act. Our bill would 
strengthen Federal law by making it 
easier for prosecutors to go after gun 
traffickers and straw purchasers, those 
individuals without criminal records 
who buy firearms for other people so 
they can bypass the Federal back-
ground checks law. Our bill would also 
fully protect the rights of the vast ma-
jority of gun owners who are law-abid-
ing citizens. 
Straw purchasing is intended to 
achieve one result: to put a gun in the 
hands of a criminal who cannot legally 
obtain one. Today, traffickers, in par-
ticular, exploit weaknesses in Federal 
law by targeting people who can law-
fully purchase guns. Then, those traf-
fickers use those guns to commit 
crimes or sell them to other criminals. 
They often ship them across State 
lines, straight up I–95’s ‘‘Iron Pipeline’’ 
and other interstate highways. They 
frequently connect with criminal gangs 
that are ready to sell or trade those 
guns for prescription opioids, heroin, 
and 
fentanyl, 
and 
commit 
other 
crimes. 
Yet right now, a straw purchaser can 
be prosecuted only for lying on a Fed-
eral form, a paperwork violation. Our 
bill would create new criminal offenses 
for straw purchasing, which would help 
law enforcement officials take down 
these criminal enterprises.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1764 
March 24, 2021 
The heroin and fentanyl epidemic is 
taking a devastating toll on all of our 
communities. Police officers in Maine 
tell me about the familiar patterns 
they see: Drug dealers and gang mem-
bers, often from out-of-State and with 
criminal records, cross into Maine and 
approach drug addicts to be their straw 
buyers, people with clean records who 
may legally purchase firearms. They 
target addicts, who exchange guns for 
heroin to support their drug depend-
encies, and the cycle repeats time and 
again. 
I received a briefing from Federal law 
enforcement officials about a case in 
Maine fitting this exact pattern. Gang 
members trafficked crack cocaine and 
heroin between New Haven, CT, and 
Bangor, ME, and committed acts of vi-
olence including assaults, armed rob-
beries, attempted murder, and murder. 
They traded narcotics for firearms and 
then distributed those firearms to 
other gang members. This is exactly 
the criminal activity our bill aims to 
prevent. And our bill would com-
plement existing laws that target 
criminals who are profiting off of fire-
arm and drug trafficking. 
It is very difficult to prevent and 
prosecute straw purchasing offenses 
under current Federal law. As I stated, 
right now, a straw purchaser can be 
prosecuted only for lying on a Federal 
form, which amounts to a paperwork 
violation. 
The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Fire-
arms Act would create new, specific 
criminal offenses for straw purchasing 
and trafficking in firearms. Instead of 
a slap on the wrist, these crimes would 
be punishable by up to 15 years in pris-
on. For those straw purchasers who 
know or have reasonable cause to be-
lieve that the firearm they are acquir-
ing will be used to commit a crime of 
violence, that crime would be punish-
able by up to 25 years in prison. 
Our bill would also strengthen exist-
ing laws that prohibit gun smuggling. 
Right now, it is illegal for someone to 
smuggle a firearm into the United 
States with the intent to engage in 
drug trafficking or violent crime. To 
combat the drug cartels operating 
across our southern border, however, 
we must also prohibit firearms and am-
munition from being trafficked out of 
the United States for these illegal pur-
poses. In doing so, our bill would pro-
vide an important tool to combat traf-
ficking organizations that are export-
ing firearms and ammunition from the 
United States and into Mexico where 
they are used by drug cartels that are 
in turn fueling the heroin crisis here at 
home. 
I also want to emphasize that our bill 
protects the Second Amendment right 
of law-abiding citizens. It protects le-
gitimate private gun sales and is draft-
ed to avoid sweeping in innocent trans-
actions and placing unnecessary bur-
dens on lawful, private sales. It ex-
pressly exempts certain transactions 
that are allowed under current law, 
such as gifts, raffles, and auctions. 
Furthermore, the bill expressly pro-
hibits any authority provided by this 
act from being used to establish a Fed-
eral firearms registry. 
The Stop Illegal Trafficking and 
Firearms Act will help keep guns out 
of the hands of criminals without in-
fringing upon the constitutional rights 
of law-abiding citizens. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
f 
IRISH-AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
wish to commemorate Irish-American 
Heritage Month and the many con-
tributions of Irish immigrants to the 
United States of America. The Irish 
have been a part of our country since 
its foundation. Donegal-born Richard 
Montgomery was the first American 
general to lose his life in the Revolu-
tionary War. Especially during the 19th 
and early 20th centuries, many Irish 
immigrants came to America to escape 
religious persecution, famine, and eco-
nomic hardship, and to seek new oppor-
tunities for themselves and their fami-
lies. 
Maryland’s long tradition of religious 
tolerance provided safe haven for many 
Irish Catholics fleeing religious perse-
cution as early as the 17th century. 
Maryland again became a leading des-
tination for the Irish during the Great 
Hunger in the early 19th century. The 
Irish helped build and defend our coun-
try. They became farmers, soldiers, 
firefighters, 
police 
officers, 
factory 
workers, labor organizers, and politi-
cians. Many Irish immigrants settled 
in southwest Baltimore and contrib-
uted great numbers to the workforce 
that built America’s first railroad, the 
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. 
Irish Marylanders have made notable 
contributions to both our Nation and 
our State in politics, science, and edu-
cation. Marylander Charles Carroll of 
Carrollton, a third-generation Irish 
American, signed the Declaration of 
Independence, was a Founding Father, 
and served as the first U.S. Senator for 
Maryland. Medical trailblazer John 
Crawford emigrated from Ireland to 
Maryland and became famous for his 
contributions to eradicating smallpox, 
helping to identify transmission path-
ways, and improving vaccine distribu-
tion. Maryland has been home to nu-
merous Irish Catholic bishops includ-
ing John Carroll, James Gibbons, and 
Michael Curley. Bishop Carroll founded 
two universities, including St. Mary’s 
College and Seminary. Bishop Gibbons 
advocated for the protection of ex-
ploited laborers during industrial ex-
pansion. Bishop Curley expanded edu-
cation opportunities throughout Mary-
land. Descendants of Irish immigrants 
have also left their mark on America 
and on Maryland. Famous Marylanders 
with Irish ancestry include Edgar Allen 
Poe and Michael Phelps. 
When the Irish came to America, 
they brought a tremendous sense of 
pride and grit. The resiliency of Irish 
Americans has helped pull our Nation 
through difficult times. Irish Ameri-
cans, despite facing trials and persecu-
tion, have persevered and have left a 
lasting, beneficial impact on our Na-
tion; Yet they also maintain a strong 
and unique sense of identity and love 
for the Emerald Isle, enriching the di-
versity of our lives and communities. 
So, this month, in addition to donning 
your green and enjoying a pint of 
Guinness, I call on all Americans to re-
member and appreciate the many con-
tributions of the Irish here in America. 
f 
HONORING OFFICER TYLER 
HERDON 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to 
honor the life of Officer Tyler Avery 
Herndon of the Mount Holly Police De-
partment. On December 11, 2020, Officer 
Herndon’s life was tragically cut short 
at just 25 years old while responding to 
a report of a break-in. I want to take a 
moment to remember him and his com-
mitment to his community. 
Officer Herndon had served in the 
Mount Holly Police Department for 
just shy of 2 years before his young life 
was taken. He had ambitions of becom-
ing an FBI agent and was approaching 
the time needed as a police officer to 
become eligible to apply. He was de-

Officer Herndon served the people of 
Mount Holly, NC, and today, we re-

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOOD 
BANK OF DELAWARE 
∑ Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of Delaware’s congres-
sional delegation in honor of the Food 
Bank of Delaware, which has provided 
healthy, nutritious food and education 
to Delaware families for 40 years. 
The Food Bank of Delaware began its 
work in 1981 out of a modest basement 
in the Northeast State Services Center 
in Wilmington. Today, it is the largest 
hunger relief organization in the State. 
In the last fiscal year alone, the Food 
Bank of Delaware distributed more 
than 15 million pounds of food, served 
more than 49,000 households through 
its mobile pantry program, distributed 
143,000 backpacks stocked with food to 
at-risk youth, provided nearly 28,000 
supplemental food boxes to seniors, and 
inspired volunteers to give 49,000 hours 
of their time to help at its 2 ware-
houses and food distribution events.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1765 
March 24, 2021 
But the Food Bank’s work didn’t stop 
there—it continues to address root 
causes of hunger by providing edu-
cation and resources to those experi-
encing food insecurity so they can lift 
themselves out of poverty and advocate 
for others. Its culinary program has 
successfully graduated more than 700 
students since the program began in 
2002, and its graduates can be found in 
some of the finest restaurants around 
the country. 
I particularly want to highlight the 
work the Food Bank of Delaware and 
its 54 full- and part-time employees 
have done and continue to do since 
March 16, 2020, when they were called 
to respond to the overwhelming need 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
During this time they facilitated 33 
mass drive through food distribution 
events throughout Delaware serving 
42,847 households, served 34,706 house-
holds through the Healthy Pantry Cen-
ters at its Newark and Milford loca-
tions, distributed 153,431 Farmers to 
Families Food Boxes, and provided 
353,009 meals and snacks to homeless 
Delawareans housed throughout the 
State to slow the spread of the 
coronavirus. 
On behalf of both, U.S. Senator CHRIS 
COONS
and U.S. Representative LISA 
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, I rise today to 
honor the Food Bank of Delaware, its 
employees, and volunteers for 40 years 
of continued dedication to the health 
and nourishment of the citizens of 
Delaware. We know your impact on the 
lives of so many has been great, and 
your goal of ending hunger is one we 
will continue to work together on until 
we can reach the goal of eradicating 
food insecurity for all in Delaware.∑

TRIBUTE TO ALEC FRAZIER 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Alexander Fuld Frazier, a remark-
able constituent who tirelessly advo-
cated for disability rights for himself 
and on behalf of others. 
Alec emerged as a leader and power-
ful advocate for disability rights and 
inclusion early in life. When he was 13, 
he spoke before sessions of Colorado’s 
House and Senate Education Commit-
tees about the importance of special 
education funding. Thanks to his ef-
forts, Colorado ultimately lifted the 
cap on funds for special education 
through a State constitutional amend-
ment. At an early age, Alec was suc-
cessful in pushing for change that 
meaningfully improved the lives of 
others. 
I first met Alec in 2017 through his 
advocacy on Capitol Hill. He shared 
firsthand how Medicaid made it pos-
sible for him to lead a complete, ful-
filling life. Alec was diagnosed with au-
tism at a young age, and some profes-
sionals suggested institutionalization 
as he grew up. With the help of Med-
icaid, he benefitted from many services 
including therapy and an emergency 
brain surgery that saved his life. 
Through his advocacy, he stood up for 
the millions of people who would have 
been severely harmed by past legisla-
tive proposals to slash Medicaid. 
Alec was a man of many talents and 
pursuits. He attained his bachelor’s de-
gree in political science and master’s 
degree in disability studies. In 2014, he 
founded his own advocacy firm called 
Autistic Reality and served as a power-
ful peer advocate, mentor, and advisor 
to others. Alec also published two 
books, ‘‘Without Fear: The First Autis-
tic Superhero’’ and ‘‘Veni! Vidi! Au-
tism!,’’ that shape how we think about 
the representation of people with au-
tism and disabilities in the arts. 
Through his written and spoken words, 
Alec sought to deepen others’ under-
standing and appreciation of the varied 
experiences of people living with au-
tism and disabilities. 
Alec believed in and exemplified the 
motto, ‘‘nothing about us without us.’’ 
Any individual or group of people de-
serve to shape the decisions made 
about them. Alec shaped his own path 
and destiny, and he empowered others 
to do the same along the way. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
sending our gratitude for Alec Frazier’s 
life, as well as our condolences to his 
father Donald Frazier, his mother 
Danielle Fuld, and his brother Nicholas 
Fuld Frazier. May we carry on his 
work to build a more inclusive society 
where all Americans can thrive and 
reach their highest potential.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1769 
March 24, 2021 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, 
and 
Pensions. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, during 
the last year we have all experienced 
the impacts of the coronavirus on ev-
eryday life. The coronavirus has shut-
tered businesses, closed schools, can-
celled events, and overwhelmed hos-
pitals and other health care facilities. 
It has fundamentally changed how we 
live our lives. 
I can think of few better examples of 
where this has been the case than in 
our K–12 schools. Hawaii public school 
students, parents, and teachers have 
told me about how they have been im-
pacted by the coronavirus. I have 
learned about the challenges they have 
faced with school closures, and heard 
about how they have adjusted to dis-
tance and hybrid learning—two terms 
that were pretty unfamiliar just a year 
ago. They are ready to return to the 
classroom. 
But they need to return safely. 
That’s why Congress recently provided 
an additional $130 billion for K–12 
schools—to make sure that when they 
do reopen, they have the necessary re-
sources to provide healthy and safe 
learning environments for students. If 
nothing else, the coronavirus has dem-
onstrated how important these envi-
ronments are for student success. 
Unfortunately, however, we know 
that even before the coronavirus many 
students lacked access to these envi-
ronments—including students in feder-
ally impacted school districts. 
In many ways it comes down to 
school facilities. A recent survey iden-
tified $4.2 billion in school facility 
needs in federally impacted schools. 
These were basic health and safety 
needs to address issues like lead and 
mold remediation; electrical, HV AC, 
and plumbing upgrades; leaky roofs; 
expired boilers; outdated technology; 
and others—hardly conditions where 
students can be expected to succeed. 
We need to make bold investments. 
We need to make them now. 
That’s why I am reintroducing the 
Impact Aid Infrastructure Act (or 
‘‘IAIA’’) for the 117th Congress. IAIA 
provides $1 billion in supplemental 
funding for Impact Aid Construction 
Grants in FY2022. Specifically, the bill 
provides funding for competitive and 
formula grants that would help our fed-
erally impacted schools build, ren-
ovate, repair, and otherwise improve 
their facilities. 
With these funds, federally impacted 
schools that are severely disadvan-
taged when it comes to raising revenue 
to 
finance 
projects 
would 
receive 
much-needed assistance. 
We can certainly do more for these 
districts, but this investment is a 
start. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. TESTER, Mr. HOEVEN, Ms. 
SMITH, Ms. ERNST, Mr. WYDEN, 
Mr. ROUNDS, Mr. BOOKER, and 
Mr. DAINES): 
S. 949. A bill to amend the Agricul-
tural Marketing Act of 1946 to foster 
efficient markets and increase com-
petition and transparency among pack-
ers that purchase livestock from pro-
ducers; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
another subject, over the years, the 
consolidation of the beef industry has 
threatened the livelihood of Iowa farm 
families and rural communities where 
they reside, and it isn’t limited to just 
Iowa. This would be farmers all over 
the country. 
I have been working since 2002 to in-
crease the producers’ leverage against 
processors, improve market price dis-
covery, and better situate independent 
Iowa cattlemen in the fed cattle mar-
kets. 
This past year, these issues became 
even more apparent and urgent because 
of the COVID pandemic. While the cat-
tle industry has internally looked for 
ways to increase the amount of cash 
trade, it has not been able to find a so-
lution. 
Unfortunately, this means that gov-
ernment intervention is needed as it is 
past time for a solution. The govern-
ment needs to step in to guarantee 
that the free market treats cattlemen 
fairly. 
From the 2012 USDA ‘‘Agriculture 
Census’’ to the 2017 ‘‘Agriculture Cen-
sus,’’ Iowa lost nearly 1,500 cattle pro-
ducers. While we don’t have USDA sta-
tistics from the past 2 years, the re-
lease of the 2022 USDA ‘‘Agriculture 
Census’’ will likely see an even more 
dramatic loss of producers because of 
the pandemic. I know this because of 
my many conversations I have with 
independent 
cattle 
producers 
from 
nearly every county in Iowa. 
During my meetings in all 99 Iowa 
counties, cattle market transparency 
and my bill introduced last Congress 
with Senator TESTER, mandating 50 
percent of negotiated cash trade in the 
cattle markets, is one of the most men-
tioned topics at those county meetings. 
The aid that Congress offered via the 
USDA Coronavirus Food Assistance 
Program provided over $7 billion in as-
sistance to cattle producers so far. 
However, this assistance is merely a 
bandaid covering a gaping wound. Con-
gress must step up again and, instead 
of providing payments to producers, 
make sure that producers have access 
to fair and transparent markets. From 
the Holcomb, KS, fire at a Tyson’s fa-
cility to the widely reported closures of 
processing 
plants 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus outbreaks, we continue to 
see a wide disparity between the cash 
price of fed cattle and the price of 
boxed beef, which, in turn, affects con-
sumer costs. 
Normally, the packer spread between 
the price of live cattle and boxed beef 
is about $21 per hundredweight, but 
USDA’s report on the coronavirus shut-
downs showed that, last May, this 
spread was $279, as opposed to that 
usual $21 per hundredweight, the high-
est since reporting began 20 years ago. 
It is just part of a pattern that has 
evolved during my time in the Senate. 
That pattern is that farmers are get-
ting a smaller amount of the overall 
dollar for their food production. 
I appreciate the leadership from Sec-
retary Perdue in issuing their USDA 
report last August. That report helps 
the cause for the Grassley-Tester legis-
lation. Beyond just highlighting prob-
lems, Perdue also offered recommenda-
tions, one of which was for Congress to 
consider a mechanism to mandate a 
level of negotiated cash trade. This is 
not a new issue in the beef industry. In 
fact, I first introduced a bill that would 
mandate cash trade way back almost 20 
years. 
Today, on behalf of Iowa’s inde-
pendent cattle producers, I am proud to 
reintroduce 
my 
bill 
with 
Senator 
TESTER
to mandate negotiated cash 
trade at 50 percent. Without a man-
dated amount of cash trade, producers 
continue to be residual suppliers and 
will lack leverage to fairly negotiate 
with packing companies. 
Earlier this month, Senator DEB 
FISCHER
of Nebraska introduced the 
Cattle Market Transparency Act of 
2021. There are some excellent provi-
sions in Senator FISCHER’s bill, such as 
the creation of a contract library, as 
well as new required reports on the 
number of cattle scheduled for deliv-
ery. These provisions will add great 
transparency and great price discovery. 
They are important to Iowans, as they 
are to Nebraskans. 
However, when it comes to a nego-
tiated amount of cash trade, Senator 
FISCHER’s bill only mandates a regional 
minimum. This means price discovery 
would still be reliant upon cattle pro-
ducers who already are negotiating. 
So what is price discovery? 
Well, put simply, price discovery is 
where a buyer and a seller agree on a 
price and a transaction occurs. 
Cattle producers of all sizes and in all 
regions recognize that price discovery 
is a public good, a very good public 
good. These producers also realize that 
the thinning of the cash market is a se-
rious problem for all market partici-
pants. Producers in the Midwest of the 
U.S. reporting regions already provide 
ample price discovery by putting in 
hard work and selling cattle using ne-
gotiated means at nearly 60 percent. 
They do this while producers who sell 
with formulas use these prices in their 
contracts. That is why something must 
be 
done. 
Any 
legislative 
solution 
should address the imbalance of the 
cash trade across the entire beef belt. 
My bill with Senator TESTER would 
simply shift the burden of price dis-
covery from independent producers, 
like those in Iowa, and spread it evenly 
among all cattle producers. 
I am looking forward to working 
with Senator FISCHER and the entire 
Senate 
Agriculture 
Committee

make permanent changes in mandatory 
price reporting, which needs to be reau-
thorized by September 30 of this year. 
Cattle producers are counting on us 
to make changes. We can no longer 
take a wait-and-see approach. The beef 
industry employs hundreds of thou-
sands of hard-working men and women 
who work each day to help feed our 
country and the world, but the USDA 
Agriculture Census shows we are losing 
these producers. 
I am asking my colleagues in the 
Senate to cosponsor my bill with Sen-
ator TESTER to ensure the strength of 
the beef supply chain and to support 
our cattle producers.

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 133 
Whereas there are 23,000,000 Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
States, constituting 7 percent of the popu-
lation of the United States; 
Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders are working on the 
front lines of the COVID–19 pandemic as first 
responders and in health care, law enforce-
ment, transportation, supermarkets, and 
other service industries; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID–19, such as 
the ‘‘Chinese Virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan Virus’’, and 
‘‘Kung-flu’’ 
have 
perpetuated 
anti-Asian 
stigma; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian rhetoric has 
resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, 
assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas, since January 2020, there has 
been a dramatic increase in reports of hate 
crimes and incidents against those of Asian 
descent in all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia; 
Whereas, according to a recent report, 
there were nearly 3,800 reported cases of 
anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID– 
19 between March 19, 2020 and February 28, 
2021; 
Whereas, in incidents of anti-Asian vio-
lence occurring in March 2020— 
(1) a woman wearing a mask was kicked 
and punched at a New York City subway sta-
tion; 
(2) 2 children and 2 adults were stabbed at 
a wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; 
(3) a couple was assaulted and robbed by a 
group of attackers in Philadelphia; and 
(4) a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hos-
pital after being attacked by bullies in Los 
Angeles, California; 
Whereas since the start of the COVID–19 
outbreak, 
anti-Asian 
discrimination 
and 
hate has continued; 
Whereas a disproportionate number of at-
tacks, approximately 68 percent, have been 
directed at Asian American women; 
Whereas since the start of 2021, there has 
been a surge in anti-Asian attacks targeting 
predominantly elderly Asian Americans; 
Whereas, on January 30, 2021, an 84-year- 
old Thai man, Vicha Ratanapakdee, died 
from injuries sustained from an unprovoked 
assault while on his routine morning walk in 
San Francisco, California; 
Whereas, in January 2021, a series of at-
tacks occurred in Oakland’s Chinatown tar-
geting Asian American seniors, and victims 
included a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old 
woman, who, in separate incidents, were vio-
lently shoved to the ground; 
Whereas, in February 2021, victims of anti- 
Asian violence included— 
(1) a 61-year-old Filipino man who was at-
tacked and slashed across his face on a New 
York City subway; 
(2) a Filipino woman in her eighties who 
was punched in an unprovoked attack while 
riding a trolley in San Diego; and 
(3) a 52-year-old Asian woman who was at-
tacked and forcefully shoved while waiting 
in line outside a bakery in Flushing, New 
York; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2021, 8 people, in-
cluding 6 women of Asian descent, were shot 
to death at 3 Atlanta-area businesses and 
this violence has heightened the pain and 
fear in the Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander community; 
Whereas anti-Asian racism has also re-
sulted in Asian American businesses being 
targeted for vandalism; 
Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000 
Asian American-owned businesses that gen-
erate over $700,000,000,000 in annual revenue 
and employ millions of workers; 
Whereas more than 1,900,000 Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander older adults, par-
ticularly those older adults who are recent 
immigrants or have limited English pro-
ficiency, may face even greater challenges in 
dealing with the COVID–19 pandemic, includ-
ing discrimination, economic insecurity, and 
language isolation; 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WHO’’) 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘CDC’’) recognize that naming COVID–19 
using geographic terms or linking it to a spe-
cific ethnicity perpetuates stigma; 
Whereas in 2015, the WHO issued guidance 
calling on media outlets, scientists, and na-
tional authorities to avoid naming infectious 
diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing 
groups of people; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services stated, 
‘‘Ethnicity is not what causes the novel 
coronavirus’’ and that it is inappropriate and 
inaccurate to call COVID–19 ‘‘the Chinese 
virus’’; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2020, the Chief 
Medical Officer of the CDC said that ‘‘stigma 
is the enemy of public health’’; 
Whereas, on March 10, 2020, the Director of 
the CDC testified that use of the term ‘‘Chi-
nese coronavirus’’ is wrong and inappro-
priate; 
Whereas the Secretary General of the 
United Nations called for international soli-
darity and an end to any ill-founded dis-
crimination; and 
Whereas, on January 26, 2021, the President 
issued a Presidential Memorandum ‘‘Con-
demning and Combating Racism, Xeno-
phobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Amer-
icans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
States’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns and denounces all forms of 
anti-Asian sentiment, including those relat-
ing to COVID–19; 
(2) recognizes that the health and safety of 
all people of the United States, regardless of 
background, must be the utmost priority; 
(3) condemns all manifestations and ex-
pressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimina-
tion, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, 
and ethnic or religious intolerance; 
(4) calls on Federal law enforcement offi-
cials, working with State and local agen-
cies— 
(A) to expeditiously investigate and docu-
ment all credible reports of hate crimes, har-
assment, bullying, and threats against the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander commu-
nities in the United States; 
(B) to expand collection of data and public 
reporting to document the rise in the inci-
dence of hate crimes relating to COVID–19; 
and 
(C) to hold the perpetrators of those 
crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and 
bring such perpetrators to justice, including 
through investigation and prosecution; 
(5) calls on the Attorney General to work 
with State and local agencies and Asian 
American and Pacific Islander community- 
based organizations to prevent discrimina-
tion, and expand culturally competent and 
linguistically appropriate education cam-
paigns on public reporting of hate crimes; 
(6) calls on the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in coordination with the 
COVID–19 Health Equity Task Force and 
Asian American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity-based organizations, to issue guidance 
describing best practices to mitigate racially 
discriminatory language in describing the 
COVID–19 pandemic; and 
(7) recommits the United States to serving 
as a model for the world in building a more 
inclusive, diverse, and tolerant society— 
(A) by prioritizing language access and 
inclusivity in communication practices; and 
(B) by combating misinformation and dis-
crimination that puts Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders at risk. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President. I rise 
today to condemn violence and dis-
crimination against Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) that has 
surged during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Since March 2020, Stop AAPI Hate has 
received nearly 3,800 reports of dis-
crimination and hate incidents nation-
wide. Unfortunately, the recent surge 
in xenophobia and hate specifically 
targeted against AAPIs is not new. 
More than 180 years ago, when the 
first Asian immigrants came to the 
United States, members of the AAPI 
community experienced prejudice and 
legalized discrimination. Xenophobic 
policies such as the Chinese Exclusion 
Act of 1882 and the Federal govern-
ment’s incarceration of more than 
120,000 
Japanese 
Americans 
during 
World War II, were born from fear, ig-
norance, and anti-immigrant hostility. 
More recently, after the 9/11 terrorist

attacks, 
Arab, 
Muslim, 
Sikh, 
and 
South Asian Americans faced a wave of 
hate incidents and blame similar to 
what AAPI individuals are experi-
encing today. As George Santayana 
said, ‘‘Those who do not remember the 
past are condemned to repeat it.’’ 
The former president espoused and 
amplified virulent intolerance using 
slurs such as the ‘‘China virus’’ and 
‘‘kung flu’’ to characterize the COVID– 
19 virus, putting the lives of 23,000,000 
AAPIs at risk, including more than 
2,000,000 AAPI frontline workers. Every 
day, these heroic individuals put their 
personal health and safety on the line 
to serve other Americans as health 
care professionals, first responders, 
transit operators, and in supermarkets 
and other essential service industries. 
However, AAPI frontline workers are 
not immune from discrimination and 
hate, which impacts both their per-
sonal and professional lives. Some 
AAPI nurses and doctors have reported 
workplace harassment from other staff 
and patients who refuse their care, 
while others have experienced terri-
fying encounters, including being vio-
lently shoved, spit on, and called racial 
slurs during their evening commute. 
The rise in attacks against older 
AAPI individuals are both alarming 
and unconscionable. In January 2021, 
three AAPI elders were violently at-
tacked in separate incidents in Cali-
fornia. Tragically, one of these individ-
uals, Vicha Ratanapakdee, died from 
injuries 
he 
sustained 
during 
an 
unprovoked assault, which his family 
believes was racially motivated. This 
discrimination which includes acts of 
physical 
violence 
is 
an 
additional 
threat elders now face as a result of the 
pandemic. Older adults are at higher 
risk of contracting severe COVID–19 
and AAPI elders, particularly those 
who are recent immigrants or have 
limited English proficiency, may face 
additional 
challenges 
in 
obtaining 
health care, enduring economic insecu-
rity, and suffering from language isola-
tion. 
Recently, on March 16, 2021, eight 
people, including six women of Asian 
descent, were shot to death at three 
Atlanta-area businesses. During a year 
of increasing racism and attacks tar-
geting AAPIs, this latest senseless act 
of violence adds to the pain and fear 
felt by many in the AAPI community. 
Our leaders must step up and confront 
racial hatred and violence. 
At Merrick Garland’s hearing to be 
Attorney General of the United States, 
I highlighted the surge in discrimina-
tion and hate crimes against the AAPI 
community. In contrast to the Depart-
ment of Justice under the Trump ad-
ministration, then-Judge Garland rec-
ognized the harm and fear that these 
incidents have caused and pledged that 
under his leadership, the Civil Rights 
Division would vigorously review and 
prosecute these cases. This is the kind 
of leadership we need in order to com-
bat these crimes. I will continue to 
raise the issue of anti-Asian hate with 
other nominees and officials to call at-
tention to the alarming rise of hate 
crimes against AAPIs and the critical 
need for action. 
The legislation that I have intro-
duced, the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, 
will help to address the ongoing surge 
in violence against AAPI communities. 
It will focus federal leadership to in-
vestigate and report hateful acts of vi-
olence, and provide resources for our 
communities to come together and 
take a stand against intolerance and 
hate. The actions of our leaders mat-
ter, and I call on my colleagues in the 
United States Senate to condemn anti- 
Asian racism, and swiftly pass the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act during the 
117th Congress. 
I yield the floor.

ferred to the Committee on Finance: 
S. RES. 134 
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Sir Winston 
Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech 
in Fulton, Missouri, solidifying the ‘‘Special 
Relationship’’ between the United States and 
the United Kingdom; 
Whereas, since the end of World War II, the 
United States and the United Kingdom have 
been beacons of freedom to the world, stand-
ing together in the fight against tyranny; 
Whereas the Special Relationship between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
has driven economic prosperity and security 
cooperation in both nations for more than 70 
years; 
Whereas the United States and the United 
Kingdom share the world’s largest bilateral 
trade and investment relationship; 
Whereas, while the United States and the 
United Kingdom already share a robust eco-
nomic partnership, there remain clear oppor-
tunities 
for 
both 
countries 
to 
further 
strengthen economic ties; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and United Kingdom Department 
for International Trade have engaged in sub-
stantive negotiations towards the conclusion 
of a comprehensive free trade agreement 
since May 2020; and 
Whereas the constitutional power of mak-
ing treaties with foreign nations includes 
both the legislative and executive branches: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the United States should strengthen 
their close and mutually beneficial trading 
and economic partnership with the United 
Kingdom; 
(2) the President, with the support of Con-
gress, should work to conclude negotiations 
for a comprehensive future trade agreement 
between the United States and the United 
Kingdom; and 
(3) during the course of finalizing a trade 
agreement, the President, in consultation 
with Congress, should strive to reach a mu-
tually advantageous resolution of commer-
cial 
disagreements 
between 
the 
United 
States and the United Kingdom.

vious order following the remarks of 
Senators SULLIVAN and SASSE. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to come down to the Senate 
floor for a couple reasons, but first I 
want to talk a little bit about what 
happened in Alaska last weekend—ac-
tually, a really important meeting be-
tween the United States and China, our 
senior diplomats, their senior dip-
lomats. It took place in Anchorage, 
and let’s just say the meeting was as 
frosty as the Alaska air. 
It was a tough meeting. The Chinese 
came out, kind of took a little advan-
tage of being extra verbose in their 
opening statements, going against the 
2-minute, agreed-upon time limit. 
It was a bit of a tongue-lashing, I 
think, of the U.S. team, our Secretary 
of State, Tony Blinken. I think our 
team pushed back appropriately—the 
National Security Advisor, Jake Sul-
livan; Kurt Campbell, who also works 
at the National Security Council. But 
this was the first face-to-face meeting 
between the United States and Chinese 
diplomats with the Biden administra-
tion. 
What we saw was a very confident 
China, a very aggressive China that 
showed up in Alaska. For example, 
they were talking about ‘‘Chinese-style 
democracy.’’ We also know that as a 
dictatorship. 
Earth to the Chinese Communist 
Party: There is no democracy in China. 
You run an authoritarian regime, so 
don’t try to fool anybody. It is a dicta-
torship, not a democracy. 
But the bigger issue is this: Xi 
Jinping and the Chinese Communist 
Party clearly believe that it is rising, 
that its rise for this century is 
unstoppable, 
and 
that 
the 
United 
States—and the West but particularly 
the United States, our country—is de-
clining and there is nothing we can do 
to stop this. They say this in private. 
They say it in public. And they believe 
it. They are confident to the point of 
being cocky, as we saw in Alaska, to 
the point of calling their dictatorship a 
democracy, which, of course, it isn’t. 
Now, my view—and I think it is the 
view of every Senator here; I certainly 
hope it is; I think it is—is that it is 
never a good idea to bet against the 
United States. Every major power in 
the world that has done so has lost 
that bet. That is a fact, but we clearly 
have work to do. We have a lot of work 
to do as it relates to this challenge. 
I have been coming to the Senate 
floor for the last 6 years talking about 
this issue, talking about this chal-
lenge, talking about some of the things 
that we need to do to address the big-
gest U.S. strategic challenge for this 
century. It is the rise of China. 
Now we have a new administration in 
power, and it was clear from the Alas-
ka meeting that the Chinese Com-
munist Party plans to aggressively 
challenge the Biden administration. 
Now, I have a lot of disagreements al-
ready with the Biden administration, 
especially the way in which they are 
treating my State. I have been speak-
ing on the Senate floor—eight Execu-
tive orders focused on Alaska, shutting 
down our economy, killing jobs. And I 
will fight them hard on this. But, on 
China, I believe it is imperative that 
we all work together, not as Democrats 
and Republicans but as Americans, as 
we have done when other major powers 
have threatened the United States. 
The Communist Party of China clear-
ly sees one of our major weaknesses as 
our political divisions. They write 
about it. It is in all the intel. They 
talk about it. Look, we are a democ-
racy. We are transparent, unlike them. 
Our political divisions are on full dis-
play. You see them tonight. By the

March 24, 2021 
way, we have had political divisions 
since the founding of the Republic. 
China doesn’t share their political di-
visions with the world, but they have 
them, no doubt about it. But here is a 
fact. Here is a fact, and we all need to 
know this. Every American needs to 
know this. Xi Jinping and the Chinese 
Communist Party’s worst nightmare is 
seeing a determined, long-term, bipar-
tisan, strong U.S. strategy to deal with 
the rise of China, to deal with the rise 
of China for what they are: our No. 1 
geostrategic challenge for this century. 
That is why we need to work together 
on this issue. It is something I have 
been calling for for a long time. And 
here is the good news: It is something 
that is starting to happen. It is some-
thing that is starting to happen. 
Now, I had a good opportunity to 
meet with Secretary Blinken, to meet 
with National Security Advisor Jake 
Sullivan and his top China national se-
curity official, Kurt Campbell, when 
they were in Alaska. I also was able to 
get a good debrief from Secretary Aus-
tin about his visits in Asia, particu-
larly in India. 
The Secretary of State and the Na-
tional Security Advisor talk about 
dealing with China from what they call 
positions or situations of strength—sit-
uations of strength. They actually 
took that term from former Secretary 
of State Dean Acheson when he was 
doing something that they are cur-
rently trying to do now: putting to-
gether a coalition, a long-term strat-
egy, in 1947, 1948, 1949 to deal with the 
Soviet Union, and they did it with 
Democrats and Republicans. NATO, the 
strategy of containment—these were 
all things that came together in this 
body. 
So I want to talk very briefly about 
some of these positions of strength 
that the administration is trying to 
put together as it relates to China, and 
I think it is in our interest to help 
them. 
First of all, I think it was important 
and, of course, as an Alaska Senator, I 
was glad that meeting took place in 
Anchorage, but it was also a symbol. 
One of the things that the Chinese 
Communist Party frequently states— 
Xi Jinping frequently states it—is that 
Asia should be for Asians. The subtext 
of that is, we are trying to kick the 
United States out of Asia. 
Well, here is more news for the Chi-
nese, for the Communist Party of 
China: We are an Asian nation. We 
have been an Asian nation for cen-
turies. My hometown of Anchorage, 
where this meeting took place, is clos-
er to Tokyo than it is to this city, 
Washington, DC. The Aleutian Island 
chain goes to the other side of the 
international dateline. We are an Asian 
nation. We are not leaving. We have 
been there 200 years; we will be there 
200, 300, 500 more. 
So that is No. 1, and I am glad they 
held the meeting in Alaska for that 
reason, on American soil, and they 
chose to do that purposely. But let me 
talk about a couple of other positions 
of strength that I think it is incumbent 
upon us to try to help this administra-
tion with, help our country with. Some 
are going to be up to the Senate and 
the House. A lot more are going to be 
up to the President and his team. 
Where we can influence it, we should. 
As I mentioned, politically being uni-
fied on issues that relate to China is 
exactly what the Chinese Communist 
Party fears the most, and it is starting 
to happen. Legislation to outcompete 
China economically—critical, critical. 
The more that we can do that, the 
more that we can show we are united, 
the more important what we do here is 
going to matter in the long-term com-
petition with regard to China. 
Let me give another one. Allies. Al-
lies. The United States is an ally-rich 
nation. China is an ally-poor country. 
They have very few allies: maybe 
North Korea; Russia maybe, maybe 
not. China doesn’t really have allies; 
they have customers. 
We have a network, and it is one of 
our most important strategic advan-
tages. We need to build upon that net-
work of allies, deepen it, expand it. 
And I will give the administration a lot 
of credit for setting this up in an im-
portant way for their first meeting, the 
leaders of the quad. 
The quad is the United States, Japan, 
Australia, and India, started by Presi-
dent George W. Bush, taken to another 
level by President Trump, and taken to 
a really high level by President Biden, 
the leader level. It was a really smart 
move. The quad can help anchor our al-
liances in the region in a critical way. 
Three of the four biggest economies in 
the world are part of the quad. Some of 
the best militaries in the world are 
part of the quad. So to have that meet-
ing, even though it was virtual, with 
the leaders—the President, Prime Min-
isters—of the quad was smart and 
something I think they should be com-
mended on. Then to have the Secretary 
of State and the Secretary of Defense 
go to Korea, go to Japan; continue on, 
the Secretary of Defense, to India—also 
very smart. 
The Chinese know this is a huge 
weakness of theirs, and it is a huge 
strength of ours. As Senators, the more 
that we can do to encourage this on our 
own, go to these countries, reinforce 
the importance of these alliances—it is 
clearly a position of strength that the 
administration is off to a good start 
with. 
Let me give another one, a position 
of strength. Our military. Our mili-
tary. This is going to be pretty simple. 
If we see dramatic cuts to our mili-
tary—and right now the Biden adminis-
tration is debating this. There is a real 
fight going on internally: Where is the 
budget going to be? We can’t see cuts. 
The second term of the Obama-Biden 
administration cut defense spending by 
25 percent. They gutted readiness. The 
Chinese and the Russians were ap-
plauding that whole period. We have 
worked hard to build that up under the 
Trump administration and Republican 
Senate. They need to keep it going. 
And here is going to be a test. Last 
year in the NDAA, we put in the De-
fense bill a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion called the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative. The admiral in charge of the 
INDOPACOM region testified in front 
of the Armed Services Committee very 
recently. His replacement testified yes-
terday. All of them said we need to 
fully fund the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative—a bipartisan part of the De-
fense bill last year—and $4.6 billion is 
what they think we need to reorder the 
balance, particularly in the area of the 
Taiwan Strait. That is public. 
The administration is debating this 
right now. They need to fund it. This 
body will approve it. That is going to 
be a position of strength that is up to 
them, but people are watching. We are 
watching, our allies are watching, and, 
of course, the Chinese Communist 
Party is watching. 
Let me give one more, one more that 
I think is critical: taking advantage of 
America’s resources, critical minerals: 
Yes, energy; yes, natural gas; yes, oil. 
Prior to the pandemic, we were the 
world’s energy superpower, largest pro-
ducer of oil in the world, largest pro-
ducer of natural gas in the world, larg-
est producer of renewables in the 
world. 
This is a good thing for our country. 
Our allies in the region know it; the 
Chinese know it. And again, there is a 
debate within the administration right 
now on energy. 
The President has recently told some 
of our great Union leaders he is ‘‘all in 
for natural gas.’’ We should do that. 
That is the reason we reduced green-
house gas emissions over the last 15 
years, more than any other country— 
big country—in the world because of 
the revolution of natural gas. Our al-
lies need that. They know it is a na-
tional security strength that we have. 
On the other hand, we have other ele-
ments in the administration that clear-
ly want to unilaterally give away our 
energy comparative advantage, restrict 
production of oil and gas. It makes no 
sense. 
So energy, energy is another position 
of strength that we should be encour-
aging, and I certainly am encouraging 
the Biden administration to recognize 
it as something good for our economy, 
good for jobs and, yes, really good for 
our national security and really impor-
tant in our competition with China. 
The Biden administration national se-
curity team knows this. I think they 
recognize it. But again, we will be 
watching. It is important. 
This is going to be an issue that we 
are going to be focused on here in the 
U.S. Senate, in my view, for the next 50 
to 100 years, if we are doing it right. If 
we work together, if we work from po-
sitions of strength, as the Secretary of 
State and National Security Advisor 
have mentioned, are focused on, the 
way this is going to end is the way it 
ended with other major powers that

TRIBUTE TO ROD BOYCE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
not Thursday yet, but it is almost 
Thursday, and that is when I love to 
come down to the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate to recognize an Alaskan who is 
doing something great for our State. 
And as many know here, we call this 
person our Alaskan of the Week. 
Now, it is one of my favorite times of 
the week. I know that a couple of Hill 
watchers like it too. I want to give a 
shout-out to Chris Cioffi from Roll 
Call. He actually did a piece in Roll 
Call today about the ‘‘Alaskan of the 
Week’’ series. So thank you, Chris. I 
hope you are watching. It is a little 
late, and it is not Thursday. But any-
way, I appreciate the shout-out in your 
series today. 
I am going to get to the punch. Our 
Alaskan of the Week tonight, this 
week, is Rod Boyce, a friend of mine, a 
former longtime editor of one of my fa-
vorite—actually, it is my favorite 
newspaper in Alaska, the Fairbanks 
Daily News-Miner. He clearly is deserv-
ing of this great, important award. 
But before I talk about Rod, let me 
give you a little update about what is 
going on in the State. First, some good 
news, something we are all very proud 
of in Alaska. The economy is hurting; 
we are not proud of that. But in terms 
of the pandemic, the health elements, 
our State continues to be the No. 1 
State vaccinated per capita of any 
State 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
is 
a 
minimiracle, by the way, because we 
are a really big State, and we are real-
ly spread out, a really small popu-
lation. And yet, the Federal Govern-
ment, Tribal healthcare system, VA, 
State of Alaska, everybody coming to-
gether is making it happen. 
About 3 weeks ago, we announced 
that anyone over 16 could get a vac-
cine. And some communities are hit-
ting 60, 70 percent vaccinated already 
in Alaska. Really important. We are 
opening up. If you are watching, and 
you don’t live in Alaska, come visit. It 
is going to be safe, but we are very 
proud of that accomplishment because 
it has taken a lot of work. 
Of course, it is cold in Alaska, but 
the Sun has been shining. The snow has 
been amazing. We have had a lot of it 
recently. The spirits are up. We have 
an Iditarod winner. Congratulations to 
Dallas Seavey on your fifth Iditarod 
win. Incredible, incredible. 
You know, some may take issue with 
the claim that Alaska is the most 
unique State in the Union, but consider 
this: Every year, teams of mushers and 
their dogs barrel hundreds of miles 
across the State toward the city of 
Nome, in some of the harshest condi-
tions, rugged conditions on the planet 
Earth. 
Certainly, these are the kind of 
events that we think make Alaska 
unique and a big sense of community. I 
have said it before: Alaska isn’t always 
the easiest place to live. It is far from 
the lower 48. The weather can be ex-
treme, very tough. But as a result, the 
people and communities bond, and they 
work together, particularly in some of 
our most remote communities. We are 
one big community in the great State 
of Alaska, as my colleague from Ne-
braska knows. 
Every 
community 
in 
Alaska, 
in 
America, needs to be able to share reli-
able, credible information. On that 
topic, of course, there has been a lot of 
negative attention in the past couple of 
years paid to some in the national 
media, particularly in the last few 
years. But the vital role, the vital role 
of local journalism and how that role 
that plays in different communities 
across our country, in my view, hasn’t 
had nearly enough attention, and it is 
a positive role, our local reporters. 
So our Alaskan of the Week, Rod 
Boyce, who, until just a few weeks ago 
was the longtime editor of the Fair-
banks Daily News-Miner, spent nearly 
his entire career, 35 years, ensuring 
that 
Alaskans 
stayed 
connected 
through local news. 
Now, Rod himself hasn’t made huge 
headlines in the State. As a matter of 
fact, that is one of the reasons for the 
Alaskan of the Week, to do a shout-out 
to someone who has not gotten a lot of 
recognition. The only time Rod has 
gotten a lot of headlines was one in-
stance of a mushing mishap. I am going 
to talk briefly about that. But as an 
old-school newsman, he liked to stay 
behind 
the 
headlines, 
behind 
the 
scenes. 
But he has been behind the scenes of 
so many of those headlines in our 
State. For years, he worked tire-
lessly—first at papers across the State 
and then for 27 years at the News- 
Miner—to keep the great community of 
Fairbanks and North Pole, AK, the in-
terior part of our State, connected and 
informed. 
So here is a little bit about Rod. 
Born 
in 
London, 
England—I 
have 
known Rod for many years, but I did 
not know that fact. Born in London, 
England, his family moved to Southern 
California in the 1960s. His father de-
signed and engineered refineries. And 
Rod’s father and his wife—Rod’s mom— 
raised both him and his sister. 
He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do 
in life, but he was inspired by a trip he 
took to England early in his college ca-
reer, came back with a camera that he 
actually found on a bench in the 
Heathrow Airport. It is an interesting 
detail. And he found his calling in jour-
nalism. He was the editor of the school 
newspaper at Humboldt State Univer-
sity and did some stints at small pa-
pers, 
landed 
at 
the 
Sacramento 
Union—the oldest paper in the West, by 
the way—one that Mark Twain used to 
write for. It was his first experience 
with a good old-fashioned newspaper 
war. The younger, afternoon paper, the 
Sacramento Bee, decided to take on 
the establishment Sacramento Union. 
Eventually, the Bee won. But by then, 
Rod had made his way to the great 
State of Alaska to enter another, even 
bigger newspaper war: the Anchorage 
Times, the established paper, versus 
the upstart Anchorage Daily News. 
Any person in news in Alaska who 
has been around a while will talk about 
that newspaper war with something of 
awe in their voice. Both papers then 
were fully staffed up, at least 30 report-
ers each, bureaus all across the State, 
even bureaus here in DC, pre-social 
media days, pre-Twitter days. Report-
ers spent their days on the streets, 
knocking on doors, stealing each oth-
er’s scoops. It was called shoe leather 
reporting, and some great journalism 
in Alaska emerged. 
Eventually, the upstart, the young 
Anchorage Daily News—still around— 
won the war. So Rod was on the losing 
team. He began to work for a small 
chain of six or seven rural papers called 
Alaska Newspapers, Inc. It was here 
that Rod got his first glimpse of rural 
Alaska. He learned about fisheries 
issues, ate his first piece of muktuk. 
That is whale blubber. He experienced 
the beauty and became aware of the 
heartbreak of rural Alaska, the true 
spiritual soul of our State, one of the 
spiritual souls of America, I would 
argue. 
After a few years with Alaska news-
papers, he took the job that he has 
been so good at for almost three dec-
ades, editor of the Fairbanks Daily 
News-Miner, which is my wonderful 
wife Julie’s hometown. It is the first 
city I lived in with Julie and our 
brandnew daughter of ours, Meghan, 
and, of course, I can still consider the 
News-Miner to be my hometown news-
paper. 
As I mentioned, Rod was an editor 
for 27 years for this great interior Alas-
ka paper. The News-Miner is small but 
mighty in Alaska, punching way above 
its weight, winning numerous jour-
nalism awards, breaking important 
stories on health crises, injustice, scan-
dals, economic opportunities, everyday 
stories about everyday people, the kind 
of stories that draw us together as 
communities. 
As Rod said, ‘‘It’s not just national 
journalism that matters. Local jour-
nalism matters [too].’’ 
To that end, it was his policy, until 
he just retired a couple of weeks ago, 
to have at least 95 percent of the front 
page of the News-Miner devoted to 
local news. That is a great idea. 
So many Alaskans have interests, 
hobbies, lifestyles that many here in 
the lower 48 just don’t understand, Rod 
included. For many years, he spent his 
days in the newsroom and his evenings 
and weekends mushing dogs. And he 
still mushes. He loves it. It is a family 
affair. He and his wife Julie used to put 
their daughter, Edie, in a sled when she 
was just in diapers. And Edie is still 
doing it. The most dogs they have ever

had now is 27. It is down to 18. This is 
hard work. It is tons of work. My wife 
Julie and her family also raised sled 
dogs. It is really hard work, particu-
larly in the cold, interior Alaska win-
ters. And it is also dangerous, as Rod 
can attest. 
In 2000, when competing for the first 
time in the 200-mile Tustumena 200 
Sled Dog Race on the Kenai Peninsula, 
he took a wrong turn. It was snowing 
hard. It was difficult to see. The trail 
got obliterated. And he couldn’t figure 
out how to get back on the trail. So he 
staked his dogs and hunkered down on 
a ridge to build camp. He had some 
candy, Reese’s Pieces, dried lamb for 
the dogs. He had a cooker, thermos, 
some fuel, some twigs. He had bunny 
boots, fortunately, but not a parka. 
He spent his days exploring, going as 
far as he dared to try to find the trail 
at night. At night, he could hear the 
helicopters above, looking for Rod, but 
they couldn’t see him through the 
cloud cover. 
What was going on turned out to be 
one of the largest land search and res-
cue missions in Alaska history, trying 
to find Rod Boyce, the intrepid editor 
of the News-Miner. But he didn’t know 
that. He just knew that his days were 
ticking away. Rod’s wife Julie was wor-
ried sick, of course, but kept it to-
gether throughout. On the sixth day— 
sixth day—almost a week, when the 
sky cleared, he headed out again and a 
snow machine came his way. ‘‘I think I 
am the guy you’re looking for,’’ he told 
the driver, Ron Poston. Ron gave him a 
candy bar and a ride to safety. 
That night, he and his wife cele-
brated with a beer and a cheeseburger. 
His feet were in bad shape, but other-
wise he was unharmed. When he made 
it back to the newsroom, his fellow re-
porters put up markers that led from 
his parking space into the building in 
case he got lost again. He thought it 
was pretty funny. 
On January 22, Rod Boyce left the 
News-Miner to take a job as a science 
writer and public information officer 
at the very cool and esteemed Geo-
physical Institute at the University of 
Alaska Fairbanks. He spends his days 
now writing about Tsunamis and the 
skies and the heavens. He said: 
It is a nerd’s dream . . . I had a good 35- 
year run in newspapers and was very fortu-
nate to experience the things that I did and 
interact with all sorts of public officials and 
regular folks on the street. I got to see them 
at their highs and lows, their tragedies and 
their happiest moments. 
He still has hopes for local news. ‘‘A 
local news outlet can tie a local com-
munity together and that is super im-
portant. I hope that never changes,’’ 
said Rod. 
Me, too, Rod. Here is to local jour-
nalism. Here is to the mighty Fair-
banks News-Miner, and here is to Rod 
Boyce. Thank you for being the guy be-
hind the headlines all these many 
years. Thank you for keeping our com-
munities and interior connected, and 
congratulations on perhaps one of the 
biggest awards you have ever received, 
our Alaskan of the Week.

TIME—H.R. 1868 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand that there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1868), to prevent across-the- 
board direct spending cuts, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I now ask for a sec-
ond reading and, in order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I object to my own 
request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion being heard, the bill will be read 
on the next legislative day. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak at some length, if time 
will permit me, about the same subject 
my friend from Washington State so 
eloquently addressed. My colleagues 
know that although when I speak, I 
sometimes get very passionate, I have 
not very often, in past years, risen to 
the floor for any extended period of 
time. I do that today because so much 
is at stake. 
For over 200 years, the Senate has 
embodied the brilliance of our Found-
ing Fathers in creating an intricate 
system of checks and balances among 
the three branches of Government. 
This system has served two critical 
purposes, both allowing the Senate to 
act as an independent, restraining 
force on the excesses of the executive 
branch, and protecting minority rights 
within the Senate itself. The Framers 
used this dual system of checks and 
balances to underscore the independent 
nature of the Senate and its members. 
The Framers sought not to ensure 
simple majority rule, but to allow mi-
nority views—whether they are con-
servative, 
liberal, 
or 
moderate—to 
have an enduring role in the Senate in 
order to check the excesses of the ma-
jority. This system is now being tested 
in the extreme. 
I believe the proposed course of ac-
tion we are hearing about these days is 
one that has the potential to do more 
damage to this system than anything 
that has occurred since I have become 
a Senator. 
History will judge us harshly, in my 
view, if we eliminate over 200 years of 
precedent and procedure in this body 
and, I might add, doing it by breaking 
a second rule of the Senate, and that is 
changing the rules of the Senate by a 
mere majority vote. 
When examining the Senate’s proper 
role in our system of Government gen-
erally and in the process of judicial 
nominations specifically, we should 
begin, in my view, but not end with our 
Founding Fathers. As any grade school 
student knows, our Government is one 
that was infused by the Framers with 
checks and balances. 
I should have said at the outset that 
I owe special thanks—and I will list 
them—to a group of constitutional 
scholars and law professors in some of 
our great universities and law schools 
for editing this speech for me and for 
helping me write this speech because I 
think it may be one of the most impor-
tant speeches for historical purposes 
that I will have given in the 32 years 
since I have been in the Senate. 
When examining the Senate’s proper 
role in our system of Government and 
in the process of judicial nominations, 
as I said, we have to look at what our 
Founders thought about when they 
talked about checks and balances. 
The theoretical underpinning of this 
system can be found in Federalist 51 
where the architect of our Constitu-
tion, James Madison, advanced his fa-
mous theory that the Constitution set 
up a system in which ‘‘ambition must 
be made to counteract ambition.’’ 
‘‘Ambition must be made to counter-
act ambition.’’ As Madison notes, this 
is 
because 
‘‘[The] 
great 
security 
against a gradual concentration of the 
several powers in the same department 
consists in giving those who administer 
each department the necessary con-
stitutional means and personal motives 
to resist encroachments by the other.’’ 
Our Founders made the conscious de-
cision to set up a system of govern-
ment that was different from the 
English 
parliamentary 
system—the 
system, by the way, with which they 
were the most familiar. The Founders 
reacted viscerally to the aggrandize-
ment of power in any one branch or 
any person, even in a person or body 
elected by the majority of the citizens 
of this country. 
Under the system the Founders cre-
ated, they made sure that no longer 
would any one person or one body be 
able to run roughshod over everyone 
else. They wanted to allow the sov-
ereign people—not the sovereign Gov-
ernment, the sovereign people—to pur-
sue a strategy of divide and conquer 
and, in the process, to protect the few 
against the excesses of the many which 
they would witness in the French Rev-
olution. 
The independence of the judiciary 
was vital to the success of that ven-
ture. As Federalist 78 notes: 
The complete independence of the courts of 
justice is peculiarly essential in a limited 
Constitution. 
Our 
Founders 
felt 
strongly 
that 
judges 
should 
exercise 
independent 
judgment and not be beholden to any 
one person or one body. John Adams, 
in 1776, stated: 
The dignity and stability of government in 
all its branches, the morals of the people,

and every blessing of society, depend so 
much upon an upright and skillful adminis-
tration of justice, that the judicial power 
ought to be distinct from both the legislative 
and executive, and independent upon both, 
that so it may be a check upon both, as both 
should be checks upon that. 
Adams continues: 
The judges, therefore, should always be 
men of learning and experience in the laws, 
of exemplary morals, great patience, calm-
ness and attention; their minds should not 
be distracted with jarring interests; they 
should not be dependent upon any one man 
or any body of men. 
In order to ensure that judicial inde-
pendence, the very independence of 
which Adams spoke, the Founders did 
not give the appointment power to any 
one person or body, although it is in-
structive for us, as we debate this issue 
in determining the respective author-
ity of the Senate and the Executive, it 
is important to note that for much of 
the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
the 
power of judicial appointment was 
solely—solely—vested in the hands of 
the legislature. For the numerous 
votes taken about how to resolve this 
issue, never did the Founders conclude 
that it should start with the Executive 
and be within the power of the Execu-
tive. James Madison, for instance, was 
‘‘not satisfied with referring the ap-
pointment to the Executive;’’ instead, 
he was ‘‘rather inclined to give it to 
the Senatorial branch’’ which he envi-
sioned as a group ‘‘sufficiently stable 
and independent’’ to provide ‘‘delibera-
tive judgments.’’ 
It was widely agreed that the Senate 
‘‘would be composed of men nearly 
equal to the Executive and would, of 
course, have on the whole more wis-
dom’’ than the Executive. It is very im-
portant to point out that they felt ‘‘it 
would be less easy for candidates’’—re-
ferring to candidates to the bench—‘‘to 
intrigue with [the Senators], more 
than with the Executive.’’ 
In fact, during the drafting of the 
Constitution, four separate attempts 
were made to include Presidential in-
volvement in judicial appointments, 
but because of the widespread fear of 
Presidential power, they all failed. 
There continued to be proponents of 
Presidential 
involvement, 
however, 
and finally, at the eleventh hour, the 
appointment power was divided and 
shared, as a consequence of the Con-
necticut Compromise I will speak to in 
a minute, between the two institu-
tions, the President and the Senate. 
In the end, the Founders set up a sys-
tem in which the President nominates 
and the Senate has the power to give or 
withhold—or withhold—its ‘‘advice and 
consent.’’ The role of ‘‘advice and con-
sent’’ was not understood to be purely 
formal. 
The 
Framers 
clearly 
con-
templated a substantive role on the 
part of the Senate in checking the 
President. 
This bifurcation of roles makes a lot 
of sense, for how best can we ensure 
that an independent judiciary is be-
holden to no one man or no one group 
than by requiring two separate and 
wholly independent entities to sign off 
before a judge takes the bench? 
There is a Latin proverb which trans-
lates to ‘‘Who will guard the guard-
ians?’’ Our judges guard our rights, and 
our Founders were smart enough to put 
both the President and the Senate, act-
ing independently, in charge of guard-
ing our judicial guardians. Who will 
guard the guardians? 
As a Senator, I regard this not as just 
a right but as a solemn duty and re-
sponsibility, one that transcends the 
partisan disputes of any day or any 
decade. The importance of multiple 
checks in determining who our judges 
would be was not lost on our Founders, 
even on those who were very much in 
favor of a strong Executive. 
For example, Alexander Hamilton, 
probably the strongest advocate for a 
stronger Executive, wrote: 
The possibility of rejection [by the Senate] 
would be a strong motive to [take] care in 
proposing [nominations. The President] . . . 
would be both ashamed and afraid to bring 
forward . . . candidates who had no other 
merit, than that . . . of being in some way or 
other personally allied to him, or of pos-
sessing the necessary insignificance and 
pliancy to render them the obsequious in-
strument of his pleasure. 
Hamilton also rebutted the argument 
that the Senate’s rejection of nominees 
would give it an improper influence 
over the President, as some here have 
suggested, by stating: 
If by influencing the President be meant 
restraining him, this is precisely what must 
have been intended. And it has been shown 
that the restraint would be salutary. 
The end result of our Founders was a 
system in which both the President 
and the Senate had significant roles, a 
system in which the Senate was con-
stitutionally required to exercise inde-
pendent 
judgment, 
not 
simply 
to 
rubberstamp the President’s desires. 
As Senator William Maclay said: 
[W]hoever attends strictly to the Constitu-
tion of the United States will readily observe 
that the part assigned to the Senate was an 
important one—no less that of being the 
great check, the regulator and corrector, or, 
if I may so speak, the balance of this govern-
ment. . . .The approbation of the Senate was 
certainly meant to guard against the mis-
takes of the President in his appointments 
to office . . . The depriving power should be 
the same as the appointing power. 
The Founders gave us a system in 
which the Senate was to play a signifi-
cant and substantive role in judicial 
nominations. They also provided us 
guidance on what type of legislative 
body they envisioned. In this new type 
of governance system they set up in 
1789 where power would be separated 
and would check other power, the 
Founders envisioned a special unique 
role for the Senate that does not exist 
anywhere else in governance or in any 
parliamentary system. 
There is the oft-repeated discussion 
between two of our most distinguished 
Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson 
and George Washington. Reportedly, at 
a breakfast that Jefferson was having 
with Washington upon returning from 
Paris, because he was not here when 
the Constitution was written, Jefferson 
was somewhat upset that there was a 
bicameral legislative body, that a Sen-
ate was set up. He asked Washington: 
Why did you do this, set up a Senate? 
And Washington looked at Jefferson as 
they were having tea and said: Why did 
you pour that tea into your saucer? 
And Jefferson responded: To cool it. 
I might note parenthetically that 
was the purpose of a saucer originally. 
It was not to keep the tablecloth clean. 
Jefferson responded: To cool it, and 
Washington then sagely stated: Even 
so, we pour legislation into the senato-
rial saucer to cool it. 
The Senate was designed to play this 
independent and, I might emphasize, 
moderating—a word not heard here 
very often—moderating and reflective 
role in our Government. But what as-
pects of the Senate led it to become 
this saucer, cooling the passions of the 
day for the betterment of America’s 
long-term future? First, the Founders 
certainly did not envision the Senate 
as 
a 
body 
of 
unadulterated 
majoritarianism. In fact, James Madi-
son and other Founders were amply 
concerned about the majority’s ability, 
as they put it, ‘‘to oppress the minor-
ity.’’ It was in this vein the Senate was 
set up ‘‘first to protect the people 
against their rulers; secondly, to pro-
tect the people against the transient 
impressions into which they them-
selves might be led. . . .The use of the 
Senate is to consist in its proceeding 
with more coolness, with more system, 
and with more wisdom, than the pop-
ular branch.’’ 
Structurally, the Founders set up a 
‘‘different type of legislature’’ by en-
suring that each citizen—now here is 
an important point, and if anybody in 
this Chamber understands this, the 
Presiding Officer does—the Founders 
set up this different type of legislative 
body by ensuring that each citizen did 
not have an equal say in the func-
tioning of the Senate—that sounds out-
rageous, to ensure they did not have an 
equal say—but that each State did 
have an equal say. In fact, for over a 
century, Senators were not originally 
chosen by the people, as the Presiding 
Officer knows, and it was not until 1913 
that they were elected by the people as 
opposed to selected by their State leg-
islative bodies. 
Today, Mr. President, you and I do 
stand directly before the people of our 
State for election, but the Senate re-
mains to this day a legislative body 
that does not reflect the simple pop-
ular majority because representation is 
by States. 
That means someone from Maine has 
over 25 times as much effective voting 
power in this body as the Senator from 
California. An interesting little fact, 
and I do not say this to say anything 
other than how the system works, 
there are more desks on that side of 
the aisle. That side has 55. Does that 
side of the aisle realize this side of the 
aisle, with 45 desks, represents more

Americans than they do? If we add up 
all the people represented by the Re-
publican Party in the Senate, they add 
up to fewer people than the Democratic 
Party represents in the Senate. We rep-
resent the majority of the American 
people, but in this Chamber it is irrele-
vant and it should be because this was 
never intended in any sense to be a 
majoritarian institution. 
This distinctive quality of the Senate 
was part of that Great Compromise 
without which we would not have a 
Constitution referred to as the Con-
necticut Compromise. Edmund Ran-
dolph, who served as the first Attorney 
General of the United States and would 
later be Secretary of State, represented 
Virginia at the Constitutional Conven-
tion, and in that context he argued for 
fully proportionate representation in 
the debates over the proper form of the 
legislative branch, but ultimately he 
agreed to the Connecticut Compromise. 
After reflection, that so seldom hap-
pens among our colleagues, myself in-
cluded, he realized his first position 
was incorrect and he stated: 
The general object was to provide a cure 
for the evils under which the United States 
labored; that in tracing these evils to their 
origin every man— 
Referring to every man who agreed 
to the compromise— 
had found it in the turbulence and follies 
of democracy; that some check therefore was 
to be sought against this tendency of our 
Governments; 
and 
that 
a 
good 
Senate 
seemed most likely to answer this purpose. 
So the Founders quite intentionally 
designed the Senate with these distinc-
tive features. 
Specifically, article 1, section 5 of 
the 
Constitution 
states 
that 
each 
House may determine its own rules for 
its own proceedings. Precisely: ‘‘Each 
House may determine the Rules of its 
Proceedings.’’ The text contains no 
limitations or conditions. This clause 
plainly vests the Senate with plenary 
power to devise its internal rules as it 
sees fit, and the filibuster was just one 
of those procedural rules of the many 
rules that vest a minority within the 
Senate with the potential to have a 
final say over the Senate’s business. 
It was clear from the start that the 
Senate would be a different type of leg-
islative body; it would be a consensus 
body that respects the rights of minori-
ties, even the extreme minority power 
of a single Senator because that single 
Senator can represent a single and 
whole State. The way it is played out 
in practice was through the right of 
unlimited debate. 
I find it fascinating, we are talking 
about the limitation of a right that has 
already limited the original right of 
the Founding Fathers. The fact was 
there was no way to cut off debate for 
the first decades of this Republic. 
Joseph Story, famous justice and 
probably one of the best known arbi-
ters of the Constitution in American 
history, his remark about the impor-
tance of the right of debate was ‘‘the 
next great and vital privilege is the 
freedom of speech and debate, without 
which all other privileges would be 
comparatively unimportant, or ineffec-
tual.’’ And that goes to the very heart 
of what made the Senate different. 
In the Senate, each individual Sen-
ator was more than a number to be 
counted on the way to a majority vote, 
something I think some of us have for-
gotten. Daniel Webster put it this way: 
This is a Senate of equals, of men of indi-
vidual honor and personal character, and of 
absolute independence. We know no masters, 
we acknowledge no dictators. This is a hall 
for mutual consultation and discussion; not 
an arena for the exhibition of champions. 
Extended debate, the filibuster, was a 
means to reach a more modest and 
moderate result to achieve compromise 
and common ground to allow Senators, 
as Webster had put it, to be men—and 
now men and women—of absolute inde-
pendence. 
Until 1917, there was no method to 
cut off debate in the Senate, to bring 
any measure to a vote, legislative or 
nomination—none, except unanimous 
consent. Unanimous consent was re-
quired up until 1917 to get a vote on a 
judge, on a bill, on anything on the Ex-
ecutive Calendar. The Senate was a 
place where minority rights flourished 
completely, totally unchecked, a place 
for unlimited rights of debate for each 
and every Senator. 
In part this can be understood as a 
recognition of our federal system of 
government in which we were not just 
a community of individuals but we 
were also a community of sovereign 
States. 
Through 
the 
Senate, 
each 
State, through their two Senators, had 
a right to extensive debate and full 
consideration of its views. 
For much of the Senate’s history, 
until less than 100 years ago, to close 
off debate required not just two-thirds 
of the votes, but it required all of the 
votes. The Senate’s history is replete 
with examples of situations in which a 
committed minority flexed its ‘‘right 
to debate’’ muscles. In fact, there was 
a filibuster over the location of the 
Capitol of the United States in the 
First Congress. But what about how 
this tradition of allowing unlimited de-
bate and respect for minority rights 
played out in the nomination context, 
as opposed to the legislative process? 
First, the text of the Constitution 
makes no distinction whatsoever be-
tween nominations and legislation. 
Nonetheless, those who are pushing the 
nuclear option seem to suggest that 
while respect for minority rights has a 
long and respected tradition on the leg-
islative side of our business, things 
were somehow completely different 
when it came to considering nomina-
tions. In fact, it is the exact opposite. 
The history of the Senate shows, and 
I will point to it now, that previous 
Senates certainly did not view that to 
be the case. While it is my personal be-
lief that the Senate should be more ju-
dicious in the use of the filibuster, that 
is not how it has always been. For ex-
ample, a number of President Monroe’s 
nominations never reached the floor by 
the end of his administration and were 
defeated by delay, in spite of his popu-
larity and his party’s control of the 
Senate. 
Furthermore, President Adams had a 
number 
of 
judicial 
nominations 
blocked from getting to the floor. More 
than 1,300 appointments by President 
Taft were filibustered. President Wil-
son also suffered from the filibusters of 
his nominees. 
Not only does past practice show no 
distinction between legislation and ju-
dicial nominations in regards to the 
recognition of minority rights, the for-
mal rules of the Senate have never rec-
ognized such a distinction, except for a 
30–year stretch in the Senate history, 
1917 to 1949, when legislation was made 
subject to cloture but nominations 
were not. Do my colleagues hear this? 
All of those who think a judge is more 
entitled to a vote than legislation, in 
1917 it was decided that absolute un-
limited debate should be curtailed, and 
there needs to be a two-thirds vote to 
cut off debate in order to bring legisla-
tion to the floor. 
But there was no change with regard 
to judicial nominees. There was a re-
quirement of unanimous consent to get 
a nominee voted on. So much for the 
argument that the Constitution leans 
toward demanding a vote on nomina-
tions more than on legislation. It flies 
in the face of the facts, the history of 
America and the intent of our Framers. 
This fact in itself certainly undercuts 
the claim that there has been, by tradi-
tion, the insulating of judicial nomi-
nees from filibusters. 
In both its rules and its practices, 
the Senate has long recognized the ex-
ercise of minority rights with respect 
to nominations. And it should come as 
no surprise that in periods where the 
electorate is split very evenly, as it is 
now, the filibustering of nominations 
was used extensively. For example, my 
good friend Senator HATCH who is on 
the Senate floor—as my mother would 
say, God love him, because she likes 
him so much, and I like him, too—he 
may remember when I was chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee back in the 
bad old days when the Democrats con-
trolled the Senate during President 
Clinton’s first 2 years in office, a time 
when the Democrats controlled both 
the Presidency and the Senate but 
nonetheless the country remained very 
divided, numerous filibusters resulted, 
even in cases not involving the judici-
ary. 
I remind my friends, for example, 
that the nomination of Dr. Henry Fos-
ter for Surgeon General, Sam Brown to 
be ambassador to the Conference on 
Cooperation and Security in Europe, 
Janet Napolitano to be U.S. attorney 
in the District of Arizona, and Ricki 
Tigert for the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation head, were all filibus-
tered. We controlled the Senate, the 
House, the Presidency, but the Nation 
was nonetheless divided. 
Some may counter that there should 
be a difference between how judicial

S1785 
March 24, 2021 
nominees should be treated versus the 
treatment accorded executive branch 
nominees, the Cabinet, and the rest. 
Constitutional text, historical practice 
and principle all run contrary to that 
proposition. 
On the textual point, we only have 
one appointments clause. It is also in-
structive to look at a few historical ex-
amples. In 1881, Republican President 
Rutherford B. Hayes nominated Stan-
ley Matthews to the Supreme Court. A 
filibuster was mounted, but the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate was un-
able to break the filibuster, and Stan-
ley Matthews’ Supreme Court nomina-
tion failed without getting a vote. 
In 1968, the filibuster to block both 
Justice Abe Fortas from becoming 
Chief Justice and Fifth Circuit Court 
Judge Homer Thornberry to occupy the 
seat that Justice Fortas was vacating 
was one where the Democrats con-
trolled the Senate, and the Republicans 
filibustered. The leader of that success-
ful filibuster effort against Justice 
Fortas was Republican Senator Robert 
Griffin from Michigan. In commenting 
on the Senate’s rejection of President 
George Washington’s nomination of 
John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court, the Republican 
Senator who mounted a successful fili-
buster against Fortas on the floor— 
translated, Fortas never got a vote, 
even though he was a sitting Supreme 
Court Justice about to be elevated to 
Chief Justice—what did the Senator 
from Michigan who led that fight say 
about the first fight in the Senate? 
That action in 1795 said to the President 
then in office and to future Presidents: 
‘‘Don’t 
expect 
the 
Senate 
to 
be 
a 
rubberstamp. We have an independent co-
equal responsibility in the appointing proc-
ess; and we intend to exercise that responsi-
bility, as those who drafted the Constitution 
so clearly intended.’’ 
There is also a very important dif-
ference between judicial and executive 
nominees that argued for greater Sen-
ate scrutiny of judicial nominees. It 
should be noted that legislation is not 
forever. Judicial appointments are for 
the life of the candidate. 
Of course, no President has unlimited 
authority, even related to his own Cab-
inet. But when you look at judges, they 
serve for life. 
An interesting fact that differen-
tiates us from the 1800s, when these 
filibusters took place, and 1968, when 
they took place: The average time a 
Federal judge spends on the bench, if 
appointed in the last 10 years from 
today, has increased from 15 years to 24 
years. That means that on average, 
every judge we vote for will be on that 
bench for a quarter century. Since the 
impeachment clause is fortunately not 
often used, the only opportunity the 
Senate has to have its say is in this 
process. 
The nuclear option was so named be-
cause it would cause widespread bed-
lam and dysfunction throughout the 
Senate, as the minority party, my 
party, has pledged to render its vig-
orous protest. But I do not want to 
dwell on those immediate consequences 
which, I agree with my Senate Judici-
ary Committee chairman, would be 
dramatic. He said: 
If we come to the nuclear option the Sen-
ate will be in turmoil and the Judiciary 
Committee will be in hell. 
However serious the immediate con-
sequences may be, and however much 
such dysfunction would make both par-
ties look juvenile and incompetent, the 
more important consequence is the 
long-term deterioration of the Senate. 
Put simply, the nuclear option threat-
ens the fundamental bulwark of the 
constitutional design. Specifically, the 
nuclear option is a double-barreled as-
sault on this institution. First, requir-
ing only a bare majority of Senators to 
confirm a judicial nominee is com-
pletely contrary to the history and in-
tent of the Senate. The nuclear option 
also upsets a tradition and history that 
says we are not going to change the 
rules of the Senate by a majority vote. 
It breaks the rule to change the rule. If 
we go down this path of the nuclear op-
tion, we will be left with a much dif-
ferent system from what our Founders 
intended and from how the Senate has 
functioned throughout its history. 
The Senate has always been a place 
where the structure and rules permit 
fast-moving partisan agendas to be 
slowed down; where hotheads could 
cool and where consensus was given a 
second chance, if not a third and a 
fourth. 
While 90 percent of the business is 
conducted by unanimous consent in 
this body, those items that do involve 
a difference of opinion, including judi-
cial nominations, must at least gain 
the consent of 60 percent of its Mem-
bers in order to have that item become 
law. This is not a procedural quirk. It 
is not an accident of history. It is what 
differentiates the Senate from the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
and 
the 
English Parliament. 
President 
Lyndon 
Johnson, 
the 
‘‘Master of the Senate,’’ put it this 
way: 
In this country, a majority may govern but 
it does not rule. The genius of our constitu-
tional and representative government is the 
multitude of safeguards provided to protect 
minority interests. 
And it is not just leaders from the 
Democratic Party who understand the 
importance 
of 
protecting 
minority 
rights. Former Senate Majority Leader 
Howard Baker wrote in 1993 that com-
promising the filibuster: 
would topple one of the pillars of American 
Democracy: 
the 
protection 
of 
minority 
rights from majority rule. The Senate is the 
only body in the federal government where 
these minority rights are fully and specifi-
cally protected. 
Put simply, the nuclear option’’ 
would eviscerate the Senate and turn it 
into the House of Representatives. It is 
not only a bad idea, it upsets the Con-
stitutional design and it disserves the 
country. No longer would the Senate be 
that different kind of legislative body’’ 
that the Founders intended. No longer 
would the Senate be the saucer’’ to 
cool the passions of the immediate ma-
jority. 
Without the filibuster, more than 40 
Senators would lack the means by 
which to encourage compromise in the 
process of appointing judges. Without 
the filibuster, the majority would 
transform this body into nothing more 
than a rubber stamp for every judicial 
nomination. 
The Senate needs the threat of fili-
buster to force a President to appoint 
judges who will occupy the sensible 
center rather than those who cater to 
the whim of a temporary majority. And 
here is why—it is a yes or no vote; you 
can’t amend a nomination. 
With legislation, you can tinker 
around the edges and modify a bill to 
make it more palatable. You can’t do 
that with a judge. You either vote for 
all of him or her, or none. So only by 
the threat of filibuster can we obtain 
compromise when it comes to judges. 
We, as Senators, collectively need to 
remember that it is our institutional 
duty to check any Presidential at-
tempt to take over the Judiciary. As 
the Congressional Research Service, 
the independent and non-partisan re-
search arm of Congress, stated, the 
‘‘nuclear option’’ would: 
. . . strengthen the executive branch’s 
hand in the selection of federal judges. 
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue, 
but an institutional one. Will the Sen-
ate aid and abet in the erosion of its 
Article I power by conceding to an-
other branch greater influence over our 
courts? As Senator Stennis once said 
to me in the face of an audacious claim 
by President Nixon: 
Are we the President’s men or the Sen-
ate’s? 
He resolved that in a caucus by 
speaking to us as only John Stennis 
could, saying: 
I am a Senate man, not the President’s 
man. 
Too many people here forget that. 
Earlier, I explained that for much of 
the Senate’s history, a single Senator 
could stop legislation or a nomination 
dead in its tracks. More recent changes 
to the Senate Rules now require only 3⁄5 
of the Senate, rather than all of its 
Members, to end debate. Proponents of 
the ‘‘nuclear option’’ argue that their 
proposal is simply the latest iteration 
of 
a 
growing 
trend 
towards 
majoritarianism in the Senate. God 
save us from that fate, if it is true. 
I strongly disagree. Even a cursory 
review of these previous changes to the 
Senate Rules on unlimited debate show 
that these previous mechanisms to in-
voke cloture always respected minority 
rights. 
The ‘‘nuclear option’’ completely 
eviscerates minority rights. It is not 
simply a change in degree but a change 
in kind. It is a discontinuous action 
that is a sea change, fundamentally re-
structuring what the Senate is all 
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1786 
March 24, 2021 
It would change the Senate from a 
body that protects minority rights to 
one that is purely majoritarian. Thus, 
rather than simply being the next log-
ical step in accommodating the Senate 
Rules to the demands of legislative and 
policy modernity, the ‘‘nuclear option’’ 
is a leap off the institutional precipice. 
And so here we collectively stand—on 
the edge of the most important proce-
dural change during my 32-year Senate 
career, and one of the most important 
ever considered in the Senate; a change 
that would effectively destroy the Sen-
ate’s independence in providing advice 
and consent. 
I ask unanimous consent to be able 
to continue for another 15 minutes. 
The PRESIDNG OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BIDEN. The ‘‘nuclear option’’ 
would gut the very essence and core of 
what the Senate is about as an institu-
tion—flying directly in the face of our 
Founders who deliberately rejected a 
parliamentary system. A current de-
bate, over a particular set of issues, 
should not be permitted to destroy 
what history has bestowed on us. 
And the stakes are much, much high-
er than the contemporary controversy 
over the judiciary. Robert Caro, the 
noted author on Senate history, wrote 
the following in a letter to the Chair-
man and Ranking Member of the Sen-
ate Committee on Rules and Adminis-
tration: 
[I]n considering any modification [to the 
right of extended debate in the Senate Sen-
ators should realize they are dealing not 
with the particular dispute of the moment, 
but with the fundamental character of the 
Senate of the United States, and with the 
deeper issue of the balance between majority 
and minority rights . . ., you need only look 
at what happened when the Senate gradually 
surrendered more and more of its power over 
international affairs to learn the lesson that 
once you surrender power, you never get it 
back. 
The fight over the nuclear option is 
not just about the procedure for con-
firming judges. It is also, fundamen-
tally, about the integrity of the Sen-
ate. Put simply, the ‘‘nuclear option’’ 
changes the rules midstream. Once the 
Senate starts changing the rules out-
side of its own rules, which is what the 
nuclear option does, there is nothing to 
stop a temporary majority from doing 
so whenever a particular rule would 
pose an obstacle. 
It is a little akin to us agreeing to 
work together on a field. I don’t have 
to sit down and agree with you that we 
are going to divide up this field, but I 
say, OK, I will share my rights in this 
field with you. But here is the deal we 
agree to at the start. Any change in 
the agreements we make about how to 
run this field have to be by a super-ma-
jority. OK? Because that way I am giv-
ing up rights—which all the Founders 
did in this body, this Constitution— 
rights of my people, for a whole gov-
ernment. But if you are going to 
change those rules with a pure major-
ity vote, then I would have never got-
ten into the deal in the first place. 
I suffer from teaching constitutional 
law for the last 13 years, an advanced 
class on constitutional law at Widener 
University, a seminar on Saturday 
morning, and I teach this clause. I 
point out the essence of our limited 
constitutional government, which is so 
different than every other, is that it is 
based on the consent of the governed. 
The governed would never have given 
consent in 1789 if they knew the outfit 
they were giving the consent to would 
be able, by a simple majority, to alter 
their say in their governance. 
The Senate is a continuing body, 
meaning the rules of the Senate con-
tinue from one session to the next. 
Specifically, rule V provides: 
The rules of the Senate shall continue 
from one Congress to the next Congress un-
less they are changed as provided in these 
rules. 
I say to my colleague from North 
Carolina, on the floor, I say to my col-
league from South Carolina, I say to 
my colleague from Utah: If you vote 
for this ‘‘nuclear option’’ you are about 
to break faith with the American peo-
ple and the sacred commitment that 
was made on how to change the rules. 
Senate rule XXII allows only a rule 
change with two-thirds votes. The 
‘‘continuing body’’ system is unlike 
many other legislative bodies and is 
part of what makes the Senate dif-
ferent and allows it to avoid being cap-
tured by the temporary passions of the 
moment. It makes it different from the 
House of Representatives, which comes 
up with new rules each and every Con-
gress from scratch. 
The ‘‘nuclear option’’ doesn’t propose 
to change the judicial filibuster rule by 
securing a two-thirds vote, as required 
under the existing rules. It would 
change the rule with only a bare ma-
jority. In fact, as pointed out recently 
by a group of legal scholars: 
On at least 3 separate occasions, the Sen-
ate has expressly rejected the argument that 
a simple majority has the authority claimed 
by the proponents of the [nuclear option]. 
One historical incident is particu-
larly enlightening. In 1925, the Senate 
overwhelmingly refused to agree to 
then-Vice President Dawes’ suggestion 
that the Senate adopt a proposal for 
amending its rules identical to the nu-
clear option. 
On this occasion, an informal poll 
was taken of the Senate. It indicated 
over 80 percent of the Senators were 
opposed to such a radical step. 
Let me be very clear. Never before 
have Senate rules been changed except 
by following the procedures laid out in 
the Senate rules. Never once in the his-
tory of the Senate. 
The Congressional Research Service 
directly points out that there is no pre-
vious precedent for changing the Sen-
ate rules in this way. 
The ‘‘nuclear option’’ uses an ultra- 
vires mechanism that has never before 
been used in the Senate—‘‘Employment 
of the [nuclear option] would require 
the chair to overturn previous prece-
dent. 
The 
Senate 
Parliamentarian, 
the 
nonpartisan expert on the Senate’s pro-
cedural rules—who is hired by the ma-
jority—has reportedly said that Repub-
licans will have to overrule him to em-
ploy the ‘‘nuclear option’’. 
Adopting the ‘‘nuclear option’’ would 
send a terrible message about the mal-
leability of Senate rules. No longer 
would they be the framework that each 
party works within. 
I’ve been in the Senate for a long 
time, and there are plenty of times I 
would have loved to change this rule or 
that rule to pass a bill or to confirm a 
nominee I felt strongly about. 
But I didn’t, and it was understood 
that the option of doing so just wasn’t 
on the table. 
You fought political battles; you 
fought hard; but you fought them with-
in the strictures and requirements of 
the Senate rules. Despite the short- 
term pain, that understanding has 
served both parties well, and provided 
long-term gain. 
Adopting the ‘‘nuclear option’’ would 
change 
this 
fundamental 
under-
standing and unbroken practice of 
what the Senate is all about. Senators 
would start thinking about changing 
other 
rules 
when 
they 
became 
‘‘inconvienent.’’ Instead of two-thirds 
of the vote to change a rule, you’d now 
have precedent that it only takes a 
bare majority. Altering Senate rules to 
help in one political fight or another 
could become standard operating pro-
cedure, which, in my view, would be 
disastrous. 
The Congressional Research Service 
has stated that adopting the ‘‘nuclear 
option’’ would set a precedent that 
could apply to virtually all Senate 
business. It would ultimately threaten 
both parties, not just one. The Service 
report states: 
The presence of such a precedent might, in 
principle, enable a voting majority of the 
Senate to alter any procedure at-will by rais-
ing a point of order . . . by such means, a 
voting majority might subsequently impose 
limitations on the consideration of any item 
of business, prohibiting debate or amend-
ment to any desired degree. Such a majority 
might even alter applicable procedures from 
one item of business to the next, from one 
form of proceeding to a contrary one, de-
pending on immediate objects. 
Just as the struggle over the ‘‘nu-
clear option’’ is about constitutional 
law and Senate history, it is also about 
something much more simple and fun-
damental—playing by the rules. 
I reiterate that I think Senator Frist 
and his allies think they are acting on 
the basis of principle and commitment, 
but I regret to say they are also threat-
ening to unilaterally change the rules 
in the middle of the game. Imagine a 
baseball team with a five-run lead after 
eight innings unilaterally declaring 
that the ninth inning will consist of 
one out per team. 
Would the fans—for either side— 
stand for that? If there is one thing 
this country stands for it’s fair play— 
not tilting the playing field in favor of 
one side or the other, not changing the

rules unilaterally. We play by the 
rules, and we win or lose by the rules. 
That quintessentially American trait 
is abandoned in the ‘‘nuclear option.’’ 
Republican Senators as well as Demo-
cratic ones have benefited from minor-
ity protections. Much more impor-
tantly, American citizens have bene-
fited from the Senate’s check on the 
excesses of the majority. 
But this is not just about games, and 
playing them the right way. This is 
about a more ethereal concept—justice. 
In his groundbreaking philosophical 
treatise, A Theory of Justice, the phi-
losopher John Rawls points to the im-
portance of what he calls procedural 
justice. 
Relying on this predecessors such as 
Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, Jean 
Jacques Rousseau, and John Locke, 
Rawls argues that, in activities as di-
verse as cutting a birthday cake and 
conducting a criminal trial, it is the 
procedure that makes the outcome 
just. An outcome is just if it has been 
arrived at through a fair procedure. 
This principle undergirds our legal 
system, including criminal and civil 
trials. Moreover it is at the very core 
of our Constitution. The term ‘‘due 
process of law’’ appears not once but 
twice in our Constitution, because our 
predecessors recognized the vital im-
portance of setting proper procedures— 
proper rules—and abiding by them. 
It is also the bedrock principle we 
Senators rely on in accepting outcomes 
with which we may disagree. We know 
the debate was conducted fairly—the 
game was played by the rules. A deci-
sion to change the Senate’s rules in 
violation of those very same rules 
abandons the procedural justice that 
legitimates everything we do. 
It is interesting to ask ourselves 
what’s different about now, why are we 
at this precipice where the ‘‘nuclear 
option’’ is actually being seriously de-
bated and very well might be utilized? 
Why have we reached this point when 
such a seemingly radical rule change is 
being seriously considered by a major-
ity of Senators? It’s a good question, 
and I don’t have an easy answer. 
We have avoided such fights in the 
past largely because cooler heads have 
prevailed and accommodation was the 
watchword. 
As Senator Sam Ervin used to say— 
the separation of powers should not, as 
President Woodrow Wilson warned, be-
come an invitation for warfare between 
the two branches. 
Throughout this country’s history— 
whether during times of war or polit-
ical division, for example—Presidents 
have sometimes extended an olive 
branch across the aisle. Past Presi-
dents have in these circumstances 
made bipartisan appointments, select-
ing nominees who were consensus can-
didates and often members of the other 
party. 
President Clinton had two Supreme 
Court nominees, and the left was push-
ing us as hard as the right is pushing 
you. What did he do? I spent several 
hours with him consulting on it. He 
picked two people on his watch who got 
90 or so votes. Moderate, mainstream 
appointments. 
He 
did 
not 
appoint 
Scalias. He did not appoint Thomases. 
He appointed people acceptable to the 
Republicans 
because 
he 
was 
wise 
enough to know, even though he was 
President, we were still a divided Na-
tion. 
History provides ample examples. 
During the midst of the Civil War, 
President Lincoln selected members of 
the opposition Democratic party for 
key positions, naming Stephen Field to 
the Supreme Court in 1863 and Andrew 
Johnson as his Vice Presidential can-
didate in 1864. 
On the brink of American entrance 
into WWII, President Roosevelt like-
wise selected members of the opposi-
tion Republican party, elevating Har-
lan Fiske Stone to be Chief Justice and 
naming Henry Stimson as Secretary of 
War. 
Other 20th Century Presidents fol-
lowed suit. In 1945, President Truman 
named Republican Senator Harold Bur-
ton to the Supreme Court. In 1956, 
President Eisenhower named Democrat 
William 
Brennan 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court. What has happened to us? What 
have we become? 
Does anyone not understand this Na-
tion is divided red and blue and what it 
needs is a purple heart and not a red 
heart or a blue heart. 
Lest any of my colleagues think 
these examples are merely culled from 
the dusty pages of history, let me re-
mind them that the Senate has wit-
nessed recent examples of consensus 
appointments during times of close po-
litical division. As I already men-
tioned, President Clinton followed this 
historic practice during vacancies to 
the Supreme Court a decade ago. 
As explained by my friend, the Senior 
Senator from Utah, who was then the 
ranking member of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, President Clinton con-
sulted with him and the Republican 
Caucus during the High Court vacan-
cies in 1993 and 1994. The result was 
President Clinton’s selection of two 
outstanding and consensus nominees— 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen 
Breyer—both of whom were confirmed 
overwhelmingly by the Senate, by 
votes of 97–3 and 87–9, respectively. 
Indeed, the last two vacancies to the 
Supreme Court are text book examples 
of the executive branch working in co-
operative and collegial fashion with its 
Senate counterpart to secure consensus 
appointments, thus averting an ideo-
logical showdown. The two constitu-
tional partners given roles in the nomi-
nation process engaged in a consult-
ative process that respected the rights 
and obligations of both branches as an 
institutional matter, while also pro-
ducing outstanding nominees who were 
highly respected by both parties. 
To be sure, a careful review of our 
Nation’s history does not always pro-
vide the examples of consultation, 
comity, or consensus in the nomina-
tion process. Presidents of both parties 
have at times attempted to appoint 
nominees—or remove them once con-
firmed—over the objections of the Sen-
ate, including in some instances where 
the Senate was composed of a majority 
of the President’s own party. And 
sometimes the Senate has had to stand 
strong and toe the line against impe-
rialist Presidential leanings. 
Our first President, George Wash-
ington, saw one of his nominees to the 
Supreme Court rejected by this Senate 
in 1795. The Senate voted 14 to 10 to re-
ject the nomination of John Rutledge 
of South Carolina to be Chief Justice. 
What is historically instructive, I be-
lieve, is that while the Senate was 
dominated by the Federalists, Presi-
dent Washington’s party, 13 of the 14 
Senators who rejected the Rutledge 
nomination were Federalists. 
The Senate also stood firm in the 
1805 impeachment of Supreme Court 
Justice Samuel Chase. President Jef-
ferson’s party had majorities in both 
the House and the Senate, and Jeffer-
son set his sights on the Supreme 
Court. Specifically, he wanted to re-
move Justice Chase, a committed Fed-
eralist and frequent Jefferson critic, 
from the Court. 
Jefferson was able to convince the 
House to impeach Justice Chase on a 
party-line vote, and the President had 
enough members of his party in the 
Senate to convict him. But members of 
the President’s own party stood up to 
their President; the Senate as an insti-
tution stood up against executive over-
reaching. Justice Chase was not con-
victed, and the independence of the ju-
diciary was preserved. 
The Senate again stood firm in the 
1937 court-packing plan by President 
Franklin Roosevelt. 
This particular example of Senate re-
solve is instructive for today’s debates, 
so let me describe it in some detail. It 
was the summer of 1937 and President 
Roosevelt had just come off a landslide 
victory over Alf Landon, and he had a 
Congress made up of solid New Dealers. 
But the ‘‘nine old men’’ of the Supreme 
Court were thwarting his economic 
agenda, overturning law after law over-
whelmingly passed by the Congress and 
from statehouses across the country. 
In this environment, President Roo-
sevelt 
unveiled 
his 
court-packing 
plan—he wanted to increase the num-
ber of Justices on the court to 15, al-
lowing himself to nominate these addi-
tional judges. In an act of great cour-
age, Roosevelt’s own party stood up 
against this institutional power grab. 
They did not agree with the judicial ac-
tivism of the Supreme Court, but they 
believed that Roosevelt was wrong to 
seek to defy established traditions as a 
way of stopping that activism. 
In May 1937, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee—a committee controlled by 
the Democrats and supportive of his 
political ends—issued a stinging re-
buke. They put out a report con-
demning Roosevelt’s plan, arguing it 
was an effort ‘‘to punish the justices’’

March 24, 2021 
and that executive branch attempts to 
dominate the judiciary lead inevitably 
to autocratic dominance, ‘‘the very 
thing against which the American 
Colonies revolted, and to prevent which 
the Constitution was in every par-
ticular framed.’’ 
Our 
predecessors 
in 
the 
Senate 
showed courage that day and stood up 
to their President as a coequal institu-
tion. And they did so not to thwart the 
agenda of the President, which in fact 
many agreed with; they did it to pre-
serve our system’s checks and bal-
ances; they did it to ensure the integ-
rity of the system. When the Founders 
created a ‘‘different kind of legislative 
body’’ in the Senate, they envisioned a 
bulwark against unilateral power—it 
worked back then and I hope that it 
works now. 
The noted historian Arthur Schles-
inger, Jr., has argued that in a par-
liamentary 
system 
President 
Roo-
sevelt’s effort to pack the court would 
have succeeded. Schlesinger writes: 
‘‘The court bill couldn’t have failed if 
we had had a parliamentary system in 
1937.’’ 
A 
parliamentary 
legislature 
would have gone ahead with their 
President, that’s what they do, but the 
Founders envisioned a different kind of 
legislature, an independent institution 
that would think for itself. In the end, 
Roosevelt’s plan failed because Demo-
crats in Congress thought court-pack-
ing was dangerous, even if they would 
have supported the newly-constituted 
court’s rulings. The institution acted 
as an institution. 
In summary, then, what do the Sen-
ate’s action of 1795, 1805, and 1937 share 
in common? I believe they are exam-
ples of this body acting at its finest, 
demonstrating its constitutional role 
as an independent check on the Presi-
dent, even popularly elected Presidents 
of the same political party. 
One final note from our Senate his-
tory. Even when the Senate’s rules 
have been changed in the past to limit 
extended debate, it has been done with 
great care, remarkable hesitancy, and 
by virtual consensus. Take what oc-
curred during the Senate’s two most 
important previous changes to the fili-
buster rule: the 1917 creation of cloture 
and the 1975 lowering of the cloture 
threshold. 
First, let’s examine 1917. On the eve 
of the United States’ entry into WWI, 
with American personnel and vessels in 
great danger on the high seas, Presi-
dent Wilson asked that Congress au-
thorize the arming of American mer-
chant vessels. Over three-fourths of the 
Senate agreed with this proposal on 
the merits, but a tiny minority op-
posed it. With American lives and prop-
erty at grave risk, the Senate still 
took over 2 months to come to the 
point of determining to change its 
rules to permit cloture. 
When they did so, they did it by vir-
tual consensus, and in a supremely bi-
partisan manner. A conference com-
mittee composed equally of Democrats 
and Republicans, each named to the 
committee by their party leadership, 
drafted and proposed the new rule. It 
was then adopted by an overwhelming 
vote of 76–3. 
In 1975, I was part of a bipartisan ef-
fort to lower the threshold for cloture 
from two-thirds to three-fifths. Many 
of us were reacting against the filibus-
tering for so many years of vital civil 
rights legislation. Civil rights is an 
issue I feel passionately about and was 
a strong impetus for me seeking public 
office in the first place. Don’t get me 
wrong—I was not calling the shots 
back in 1975; I was a junior Senator 
having been in the chamber for only 2 
years. 
But I will make no bones about it— 
for about two weeks in 1975—I was part 
of a slim bipartisan majority that sup-
ported jettisoning established Senate 
rules and ending debate on a rules 
change by a simple majority. 
The rule change on the table in 1975 
was not to eliminate the filibuster in 
its entirety, which is what the current 
‘‘nuclear option’’ would do for judicial 
nominations; rather it was to change 
from the then-existing two-thirds clo-
ture requirement to three-fifths. It was 
a change in degree, not a fundamental 
restructuring of the Senate to com-
pletely do away with minority rights. 
The rule change was also attempted 
at the beginning of the Senate session 
and applied across the board, as op-
posed to the change currently on the 
table, brought up mid-session con-
cerning only a very small subset of the 
Senate’s business. Nonetheless, my de-
cision to support cutting off debate on 
a rules change by a simple majority 
vote was misguided. 
I carefully listened to the debate in 
1975 and learned much from my senior 
colleagues. In particular, I remember 
Senator Mansfield being a principled 
voice against the effort to break the 
rules to amend the rules. 
Senator Mansfield stood on this floor 
and said the following: 
[T]he fact that I can and do support 
[changing the cloture threshold from 2⁄3 to 3⁄5] 
does not mean that I condone or support the 
route taken or the methods being used to 
reach the objective of Senate rule 22. The 
present motion to invoke cloture by a simple 
majority, if it succeeds would alter the con-
cept of the Senate so drastically that I can-
not under any circumstances find any jus-
tification for it. The proponents of this mo-
tion would disregard the rules which have 
governed the Senate over the years, over the 
decades, simply by stating that the rules do 
not exist. They insist that their position is 
right and any means used are, therefore, 
proper. I cannot agree. 
Senator Mansfield’s eloquent defense 
of the Senate’s institutional character 
and respect for its rules rings as true 
today as it did 30 years ago. Senator 
Mansfield’s courage and conviction in 
that emotionally charged time is fur-
ther evidence, I believe, of why he is 
one of the giants of the Senate. 
In the end, cooler heads prevailed and 
the Senate came together in a way 
only the Senate can. I changed my 
mind; I along with my Senate col-
leagues. We reversed ourselves and 
changed the cloture rule but only by 
following the rules. Ultimately, over 3⁄4 
of the voting Senators—a bipartisan 
group—voted to end debate. In fact, the 
deal that was struck called for reduc-
ing the required cloture threshold from 
2⁄3 to 3⁄5; but it retained the higher 2⁄3 
threshold for any future rules changes. 
Now I understand that passions today 
are running high on both sides of the 
‘‘nuclear option’’ issue, and I can relate 
to my current Republican colleagues. I 
agree with my distinguished Judiciary 
Committee Chairman that neither side 
has clean hands in the escalating judi-
cial wars. 
I also understand the frustration of 
my Republican colleagues—especially 
those who are relatively new to this 
Chamber—that a minority of Senators 
can have such power in this body. 
For me, the lesson from my 1975 ex-
perience, which I believe strongly ap-
plies to the dispute today, is that the 
Senate ought not act rashly by chang-
ing its rules to satisfy a strong-willed 
majority acting in the heat of the mo-
ment. 
Today, as in 1975, the solution to 
what some have called a potential con-
stitutional crisis lies in the deliberate 
and thoughtful effort by a bipartisan 
majority of Senators to heed the wis-
dom of those who established the care-
fully crafted system of checks and bal-
ances protecting the rights of the mi-
nority. It’s one thing to change Senate 
rules at the margins and in degrees, 
it’s quite another to overturn them. 
Federalist No. 1 emphasizes that 
Americans have a unique opportunity— 
to choose a form of government by ‘‘re-
flection and choice’’: 
It has been frequently remarked that it 
seems to have been reserved to the people of 
this country . . . to decide the important 
question, whether societies of men are really 
capable or not of establishing good govern-
ment from reflection and choice, or whether 
they are forever destined to depend for their 
political constitutions on accident and force. 
We need to understand that this is a 
question posed at the time of the 
founding and also a question posed to 
us today. At the time of the founding, 
it was a question about whether Amer-
ica would be able to choose well in de-
termining our form of government. 
We know from the experience of the 
last 225 years that the founding genera-
tion chose well. As a question posed to 
citizens and to Senators of today, it is 
a question about whether we will be 
able to preserve the form of govern-
ment they chose. 
The Framers created the Senate as a 
unique legislative body designed to 
protect against the excesses of any 
temporary majority, including with re-
spect to judicial nominations; and they 
left all of us the responsibility of guar-
anteeing an independent Federal judi-
ciary, one price of which is that it 
sometimes reaches results Senators do 
not like. 
It is up to us to preserve these pre-
cious guarantees. Our history, our

American sense of fair play, and our 
Constitution demand it. 
I would ask my colleagues who are 
considering supporting the ‘‘nuclear 
option’’—those who propose to ‘‘jump 
off the precipice’’—whether they be-
lieve that history will judge them fa-
vorably. 
In so many instances throughout this 
esteemed body’s past, our forefathers 
came together and stepped back from 
the cliff. In each case, the actions of 
those 
statesmen 
preserved 
and 
strengthened the Senate, to the better-
ment of the health of our constitu-
tional republic and to all of our advan-
tage. 
Our careers in the Senate will one 
day end—as we are only the Senate’s 
temporary officeholders—but the Sen-
ate itself will go on. 
Will historians studying the actions 
taken in the spring of 2005 look upon 
the current Members of this Senate as 
statesmen who placed the institution 
of the United States Senate above 
party and politics? 
Or will historians see us as politi-
cians bending to the will of the Execu-
tive and to political exigency? 
I, for one, am comfortable with the 
role I will play in this upcoming his-
toric moment. 
I hope all my colleagues feel the 
same.

of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along 
with the computerization of this infor-
mation, the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest will prepare this information for 
printing in the Extensions of Remarks 
section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Monday and Wednesday of each 
week.
