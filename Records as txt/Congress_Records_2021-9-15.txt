GULF COAST HURRICANE AID ACT AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, just a 
few weeks ago, Southeast Louisiana 
was pummeled by Hurricane Ida on the 
16th anniversary, to the day, of Hurri-
cane Katrina’s landfall. Ida knocked 
out power across the State, including 
the entire city of New Orleans and its 
populated suburb of Jefferson Parish. 
The storm brought intense flooding 
that took lives and devastated commu-
nities. 
I have some posters to place here. 
This is of St. John Parish in LaPlace, 
LA, and this of Galliano. You can see 
both the flooding and the damaged 
housing. 
Hurricane 
Ida 
struck 
Louisiana’s 
shores as a category 4 storm, with 
winds as high as 150 miles per hour, 
making it the fifth most powerful 
storm to ever hit the United States. 
Ida hit just 2 days after the 1-year an-
niversary of Hurricane Laura, which at 
the time, on August 27, 2020, was the 
strongest storm to hit Louisiana in 164 
years. Laura devastated Southwest 
Louisiana. So Ida hit the southeast, 
and Laura, last year, hit the south-
west. 
Unfortunately for my State, we are 
no strangers to extreme weather as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6516 
September 15, 2021 
2020 set a record nationally for the 
most named storms in a single season, 
with 30, 5 of which hit my State. Last 
year, Louisiana’s farmers also had cat-
astrophic damage to livestock, crops, 
structures, and other things during un-
precedented winter storms. In the 
aftermath of Ida, 29 Louisianans and 85 
Americans total died. 
Yesterday was the first day the num-
ber of folks in Louisiana who were 
without power was below six figures. 
Those in Lafourche Parish, lower Jef-
ferson Parish, and lower Terrebonne 
Parish are estimated to have power re-
stored on September 29. That is still 2 
weeks from today and a month after 
Ida made landfall on August 29. 
I will put up pictures now of Jeffer-
son Parish and of Lafourche Parish. 
Again, you see flooding and damage, 
with power lines knocked down and 
lines hanging from the sky, it seems, 
but you can see the kind of devastation 
it did to electrical grids. Again, here is 
the damage widespread in Lafourche 
Parish. 
By the numbers, FEMA has received 
over 594,000 applications for individual 
assistance, of which 285,000 have been 
approved by the Blue Roof Program. 
We call it that because, when the shin-
gles are blown off your roof and some-
times the boards or the tin, tarps are 
placed over to keep the rain from com-
ing through. So it is a measure, if you 
will, of how many people had signifi-
cant roof damage, but this is an under-
estimate. The Blue Roof has almost 
50,000 validated requests, and the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program has 
10,579 claims. The Small Business Ad-
ministration has 17,083 disaster assist-
ance loan applications, and temporary 
sheltering assistance to almost 10,000 
households with almost 29,000 individ-
uals. 
So, as Louisiana begins to recover, 
we need two things. 
First, we need supplemental disaster 
assistance. By the way, this goes back 
to the 2020 storms—Hurricanes Laura, 
Delta, and Zeta. Just last week, the 
White House’s budget office sent a for-
mal request to Congress, acknowl-
edging the unmet needs for these com-
munities over a year later. 
Now, recall I spoke to the blue tarps 
and how your shingles blow off or the 
tin blows off or the boards blow off, and 
you put on a blue tarp. If you fly over 
Lake Charles now, a year after those 
storms, you will still see blue tarps, 
which is to say homes vulnerable to a 
rain event like Hurricane Nicholas, in 
which rain continues to come through, 
damaging the inside of the house and 
making the home unlivable. Not sur-
prisingly, many folks are not back in 
their homes. 
It is time to pass the disaster assist-
ance bill for Laura, for Delta, for the 
winter storms, and for Ida. 
Second, we must also take steps to 
prevent this level of devastation in the 
future. Ida gives us a harsh reminder 
that we need to strengthen the infra-
structure that protects us from the 
worst of these storms, including im-
proving 
highways 
and 
evacuation 
routes, hardening our electrical grid, 
and investing in flood mitigation. 
Now I will put up posters of Larose, 
LA, and of St. Bernard. Again, this 
community is without power, and in 
this community, you can see the de-
struction done to port facilities. 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, which awaits a 
vote in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, is a critical missing piece. 
It benefits all States, by the way. 
The Presiding Officer’s State has been 
affected by natural disasters. Resil-
iency money would really mean a lot in 
his State. It would mean a heck of a lot 
in my State. It would mean a lot in 
every State. 
But to speak specifically of Lou-
isiana, Louisiana will receive almost $6 
billion over the next 5 years for roads 
and bridges. That is $1.2 billion more 
than 
we 
would 
ordinarily 
receive. 
There is an additional $8.8 billion 
available nationwide for transportation 
infrastructure, 
including 
evacuation 
routes and at-risk coastal infrastruc-
ture grants. 
In Louisiana, this money could help 
complete Interstate 49 in LaFayette, 
complete the segment in the south, and 
complete the segment in Shreveport, I– 
49, to give an unfettered evacuation 
route should a storm hit either New 
Orleans or the Bayou region. It also in-
cludes 
six-laneing 
Interstate 
12 
through the Florida parishes, as we 
call them, and a new Mississippi River 
bridge in Baton Rouge. It should not 
take hours to go through a 10-mile—lit-
erally, hours—to go through a 10-mile 
stretch in the Capital Region of Lou-
isiana when a storm is on its way, and 
there is a mandatory evacuation order. 
Now, by the way, we know resiliency 
works. We know this investment pays 
dividends because the damage from Ida 
could have been worse. But George W. 
Bush made a commitment 16 years ago 
to build levees to protect Jefferson 
Parish, 
Orleans, 
St. 
Bernard, 
and 
Plaquemines Parish. 
So when I went down to St. Bernard 
afterward—when I went down to Jeffer-
son Parish recently, and I met with 
elected officials, one of them looked to 
the ground and said: The ground is dry. 
We did not flood. And we did not flood 
because 16 years ago George W. Bush 
said: We shall build a levee system. We 
shall build resiliency. 
Now the onus is upon us to make a 
commitment to harden the grid, to 
bury the power lines, which not only 
protects Louisiana in a hurricane but 
Texas in an ice storm and the West 
from forest fires caused by arcs from 
utility lines to a dried-out forest. 
In the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, there is $26 billion specifi-
cally to strengthen our Nation’s elec-
trical grid and to prevent these sorts of 
widespread power outages and these 
sorts of natural disasters. This funding 
includes $5 billion to enhance the resil-
iency of electrical grids from extreme 
weather and natural disasters, $12.5 bil-
lion to increase power transmission to 
maintain reliable access to energy, and 
$9 billion to develop and deploy new 
technology to strengthen grid reli-
ability and resiliency. Now, some of 
these pots of money are specifically 
targeted for States like Louisiana 
which have been impacted by federally 
declared natural disasters over the last 
10 years. That is the way to build resil-
iency. 
So my plea is that we cut politics 
and actually get something done for 
the American people. I was meeting 
with a parish councilwoman, Jennifer 
Van Vrancken, from Jefferson Parish, 
and she said: When we get to the point 
where we don’t do what is right be-
cause of politics, our country will go 
down. 
I said that to another group of people 
shortly after that, rock-ribbed Repub-
licans—some of them wearing their 
MAGA hats—and I quoted Council-
woman Van Vrancken, and they all 
said: That is the situation we are in 
now. So my rock-ribbed Republicans 
were agreeing with the Republican 
councilwoman. But speaking more gen-
erally, if we don’t do what is right be-
cause of politics, our country will suf-
fer. We have got to get this bill done 
and put the politics aside. 
There is so much good in this bill. 
There 
is 
flood 
mitigation 
dollars, 
coastal restoration dollars, permitting 
reform to get projects done early and 
on time, and I can keep going. But re-
covery is a two-pronged approach. It 
starts with aid, and it finishes with the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill, a bill 
that helps our communities rebuild 
from past storms and better prepares 
our communities for future storms. 
My folks in Louisiana are strong. 
They are resilient. But we need the 
long-awaited 
supplemental 
disaster 
aid, and we need to build resiliency for 
the future. Both is how we prepare not 
just my State but our Nation. Let’s fi-
nally get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6517 
September 15, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ECONOMY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor of the Senate today to 
talk about our economy, talk about 
the new massive tax hikes that Demo-
crats in the House of Representatives 
have now proposed to pay for the $3.5 
trillion spending spree that is called 
‘‘reconciliation.’’ I want to talk about 
why it is bad for American workers, 
why it is bad for our economy, bad for 
small businesses, and bad for American 
families. 
They call it the Build Back Better 
plan, but it is really tearing down what 
helped us to be better and what helped 
to make us a more fair economy and an 
opportunity economy, by getting rid of 
the positive aspects of the 2017 tax re-
form and tax cut legislation and, in-
stead, putting in place massive new tax 
increases. 
By the way, these tax increases go 
even beyond eliminating the tax relief 
that was provided in 2017. In many 
cases, it provides additional tax in-
creases even higher than we had before 
2017. 
We had a historically strong econ-
omy leading up to COVID–19, in large 
measure because of this 2017 Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act, which focused on expand-
ing opportunities for businesses to 
grow; for families to take home more 
of their hard-earned cash; and for the 
United States, as a country, to be able 
to compete globally. It made us more 
competitive. 
As a result, before COVID–19, we saw 
record growth in jobs and wages. In 
February of 2020, as we were getting 
into the COVID–19 pandemic, we had 19 
straight months of job growth and 
wage 
growth 
of 
over 
3 
percent 
annualized. For 19 straight months, we 
had seen wages go up every single 
month. We had wages above inflation 
for the first time really in a decade and 
a half in my home State of Ohio. 
This benefit in wages went mostly to 
lower-income workers and middle-in-
come workers—exactly what you would 
want. This follows a study by the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office, 
or CBO, that found that 70 percent of 
corporate tax cuts end up going into 
workers’ wages—70 percent goes into 
workers’ wages and benefits. 
So it all made sense. As we made 
America more competitive, as we made 
our 
businesses 
more 
competitive— 
small businesses and large businesses— 
what we saw was wages going up and 
wages going up for everybody. But, 
again, the highest percentage increases 
were actually among those who were at 
the lower end of the income scale, or 
middle-income workers. 
During that time period, just before 
COVID–19 hit, we also tied the 50-year 
low in unemployment. We had 3.5 per-
cent unemployment. We had historic 
lows in unemployment, by the way, the 
lowest ever for certain groups in our 
economy, including Black workers and 
Hispanic workers. 
We had, in 2019, a median income for 
U.S. households that had the largest 
inflation-adjusted gain going back to 
at least 1967. So you had to go back to 
the 1960s to find incomes rising that 
much. 
And before the pandemic, we had the 
lowest poverty rate ever recorded. So 
for the 60 years we have been recording 
the poverty rate in this country, it was 
the lowest it had ever been, going into 
the pandemic. That is good news. We 
should be celebrating that. 
And, again, what Democrats are now 
talking about doing is going back and 
changing that very law by increasing 
taxes in a massive way that created so 
much of that opportunity. 
Those 2017 reforms also helped the 
U.S. compete globally by stopping 
what were called corporate inversions 
that were a recurring problem during 
the Obama administration and during 
the first year of the Trump administra-
tion. This is where U.S. companies ac-
tually said: You know what, our tax 
laws are so bad in this country, we are 
going to invert, meaning we are going 
to become foreign companies. 
So we had companies in my State of 
Ohio and other States around the coun-
try actually say: We are not going to 
be American companies anymore be-
cause we can’t compete with the Tax 
Code we have got here. We are going to 
become foreign companies. 
A lot of us criticized that and strong-
ly urged these companies not to do it, 
but the reality was our Tax Code was 
driving it; and that is one reason we 
changed the Tax Code in 2017, to stop 
this movement of jobs and investment 
overseas and to say we would rather 
have you invest here in America, and it 
worked. 
Prior to that time, there was some-
thing called the lockout effect, where 
companies would keep their earnings 
overseas. They made money overseas, 
they kept it overseas, and they never 
brought it back to America. After this 
law, $1.6 trillion in overseas earnings 
came back home to America to invest 
here and create jobs here. 
As a result of these changes, by the 
way, the largest U.S. companies in-
creased their domestic research and de-
velopment spending—R&D spending— 
by 25 percent, to $707 billion, and in-
creased their capital expenditures by 
about 20 percent, to $1.4 trillion. 
That is good. We like that. We want 
more money to come back into Amer-
ica, invest in America, and increase re-
search and development to make us 
more efficient and more technological 
and, therefore, more competitive and 
more productive. And we like the fact 
that there were capital expenditures 
going up because the Tax Code worked 
to create that incentive. 
All of this should make it clear that 
the opportunity economy we had in 
those couple of years before COVID, 
thanks to the 2017 tax reform changes, 
largely worked for everybody. Workers 
took home larger paychecks. The aver-
age American family saved at least 
$2,000 on their tax bill. 
But this tax plan before us now would 
throw all that out. Again, it tears down 
what makes us better. The massive tax 
hike being pushed by President Biden 
and congressional Democrats would be 
the largest tax increase since 1968, and 
almost no aspect of the Tax Code is left 
untouched. 
This 
include 
increases 
in 
estate 
taxes. Now, this is a problem because if 
you are a business and you want to 
pass along your business to the next 
generation, you got to be sure the es-
tate tax isn’t so high that the govern-
ment, in effect, has a confiscatory rate 
where you have to sell the business in 
order to pay the taxes. 
Capital gains taxes go up. This is 
taxes going up on investment. We want 
to encourage capital gains because that 
is assets you hold for a while. We want 
to encourage more investment in this 
country. That creates jobs and makes 
us more productive. 
It increases taxes on retirement ac-
counts. It increases income taxes. It in-
creases small business taxes. So if you 
are a small business owner in America, 
watch out. It increases corporate tax. 
We talked about how we lowered cor-
porate taxes to make them more com-
petitive, and the result was they cre-
ated not just more jobs but higher pay-
ing jobs, and they brought the money 
back from overseas. And the list keeps 
going from there. 
American workers and families will 
find themselves losing more of their 
hard-earned cash from all sides. Each 
of these proposed increases will be 
harmful. But as one of the people in-
volved in the 2017 international tax re-
forms, I am particularly concerned 
about the effects of undoing the re-
forms we put in place there to make us 
more competitive, and, specifically, 
the issue of raising the corporate tax 
from 21 percent to 26.5 percent, as pro-
posed. 
Some, including here in the Senate, 
would like to raise that tax even high-
er. 
What is the problem with that? 
Well, it is pretty simple. Once again, 
America would have the highest cor-
porate tax rate among all the devel-
oped countries in the world. That is 
not a good thing because it makes us 
less competitive. And it is about our 
workers. Ultimately, they are the ones 
who bear the burden, as we said. 
At 26.5 percent, we would have a na-
tional average on the corporate side of 
31 percent when you take into account 
the fact that we have State and local 
corporate taxes here. Other countries, 
for the most part, don’t do that. They 
have a Federal tax only. This means, 
again, we are going to have the highest 
corporate tax rate in the developed 
world. 
By the way, our rate could also be 
higher than China. So it is not just de-
veloped countries; it is also countries 
like China, who we are competing with, 
that would have lower rates than us. It 
creates an unequal playing field and 
making it really hard—in some cases

impossible—for U.S. workers to com-
pete against rivals in places like China, 
but also the European Union and else-
where. 
It also makes costly and complicated 
changes for U.S. companies to operate 
outside the United States, punishing 
American workers who have jobs here 
in support of those international sales. 
Remember, we are only about 5 percent 
of the global economy, and we are 
about 20, 25 percent of the GDP. The 
economic mass of our country is some-
thing that, you know, we want to grow 
because that creates more jobs here. 
If you are a company in America that 
sells overseas, that is something we 
should encourage because it creates 
jobs here in America. 
I will give you an example. In my 
own hometown of Cincinnati, OH, the 
Proctor & Gamble Company is there. 
They are a global company. They sell 
all over the world. We like that be-
cause it creates a lot of jobs in Cin-
cinnati. About 40 percent of the jobs in 
Cincinnati—I don’t know if they have 
maybe 13-, 14-, 15,000 jobs now in our 
area—40 percent of those jobs are there 
only because of the international sales. 
They support the international side of 
the business. So this notion that we are 
going to raise our taxes so high that 
you can’t compete internationally be-
cause other countries have such lower 
rates that their companies are going to 
beat you in the marketplace every 
time, that takes away jobs in America. 
We want to be a country that does 
business overseas, that sells stuff over-
seas because that creates jobs here. 
Under the Democrats’ plan, invest-
ment in the United States will slow, 
and companies will begin, once again, 
saying: I am going to just become a 
foreign company. I hate that. We want 
more American companies here. They 
tend to take their jobs and investment 
with them when they do that, by the 
way, which makes sense. 
As I said, according to multiple stud-
ies, including the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office here in Wash-
ington, it is the workers who are going 
to bear the burden of higher taxes in 
the form of lower wages and benefits 
and lost jobs. 
There was a 2017 study by another 
group called the Tax Foundation that 
found that 70 percent of corporate 
taxes are borne by workers. It is no 
surprise, then, that the nonpartisan 
Joint Committee on Taxation here in 
the Congress found that two-thirds of 
the Democrats’ corporate tax hike 
would fall on lower and middle-income 
taxpayers, which includes the small 
businesses that file taxes as individ-
uals. 
Meanwhile, because of the huge tax 
increases we are talking about, compa-
nies are going to raise their prices. 
American families are going to feel the 
pain in the form of higher prices at the 
store, on top of the surging inflation 
we are already seeing, thanks to the 
Biden administration’s spending poli-
cies they have already put in place. 
That $1.9 trillion, almost $2 trillion in 
spending, so-called stimulus, that was 
one of the reasons, according to econo-
mists—right, left, and center—includ-
ing Larry Summers, who is a promi-
nent Democrat economist, that we see 
these huge inflation numbers, because 
when you throw that stimulus money 
out there, it increases inflation, which 
makes it more expensive to buy every-
thing from gasoline to clothes and 
food. It makes the wage gains that we 
have been able to see recently much 
smaller than they would otherwise be 
because inflation is eating up those 
gains. So this is not what we want to 
do for our economy. 
On the small business side, the vast 
majority of small businesses pay their 
taxes on their individual tax return. So 
about 80 or 90 percent of the businesses 
in Ohio or around the country don’t 
pay their taxes as corporations. They 
pay their taxes as individuals. So think 
about the small businesses in your 
community. They are probably part-
nerships or what is called subchapter S 
companies, passthrough companies of 
some kind. They might be sole propri-
etors. But their tax bill comes due on 
their individual tax return. Unfortu-
nately, the Democrats are increasing 
the taxes on those people too. 
A lot of those people will be lumped 
into the expanded top bracket of the 
income tax code, and, therefore, they 
will be paying 39.6 percent income tax, 
plus a 3.8-percent surtax on small busi-
ness income. So that takes them into a 
tax rate that is well above what they 
are paying now. They will be in the 
twenties now, and they will be in the 
forties under this new proposal. 
You might say: Well, that is for peo-
ple in the top bracket. 
Well, those people in the top bracket 
are often small businesses. If you are a 
small business, all that revenue in the 
business is counted toward your rev-
enue. You may take nothing out of the 
company. You may just take a divi-
dend to just pay your taxes. That is 
what a lot of small companies do. 
I grew up in a small company like 
that. You know, we would issue a divi-
dend to pay the taxes, but our income 
included all the income of the com-
pany. And that is the way America 
works. That is the way our Tax Code 
works. Some have argued that it 
shouldn’t work that way, but that is 
the way it works. So when you raise 
taxes on individuals, you are also rais-
ing taxes on a lot of these small busi-
nesses. 
Adding to this, Democrats say they 
now want to eliminate the really im-
portant 20 percent deduction on quali-
fied business income for small busi-
nesses. 
So for all the passthrough companies 
in America, pay attention. You know, 
that 20 percent deduction that is out 
there, Democrats are now saying they 
want to eliminate that altogether. 
That was designed to enable smaller 
businesses to be able to compete, to be 
able to have a level playing field be-
tween the corporations—the C corpora-
tions—that just tend to be the larger 
companies, and the passthrough com-
panies. 
Additionally, small businesses that 
earn over $5 million will be saddled 
with an additional 3-percent surcharge 
under the Democrat plan. This means 
that so many of these small businesses 
that drive our economy, that are suc-
cessful, that are employing so many 
people are going to have a harder time 
hiring workers or paying them com-
petitive wages. Again, they tend to be 
smaller businesses, but they are the 
backbone of our company. 
About half of the workers in America 
work for businesses like this. So they 
may be 80 or 90 percent of the busi-
nesses, but because they are smaller, 
they employ about half the people. But 
this is where we get so much of our in-
novation. This is where we have so 
many opportunities for lower income 
workers to get a start. This is where 
the American dream is found. 
Under current policy, the Congres-
sional Budget Office suspects that as 
the economy continues to recover from 
the pandemic, tax revenues will grow— 
and I quote them here—to ‘‘18.1 per-
cent’’ of the economy, ‘‘GDP in 2022.’’ 
So next year, 18.1 percent of the econ-
omy will be tax revenues, and then 
‘‘fluctuate between 17.5 percent and 
18.1 percent’’ of our economy ‘‘through 
2031.’’ So they are saying taxes as a 
percent of the economy will be some-
where between 17.5 and 18.1 percent be-
tween now and 2031, over the next 10 
years; next year, 18.1 percent. 
This is interesting because Demo-
crats are saying, well, taxes need to be 
higher. The historical average is 17.3 
percent. So the estimate from the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
says we are going to be between 17.5 
and 18.1, and next year, already, at 18.1 
percent; whereas, the historical aver-
age is 17.3 percent. Even this year, as 
we are still recovering from the pan-
demic and tax receipts are less, it is ex-
pected to be 17.2 percent, based on the 
Congressional Budget Office. 
So you have to think about this. Why 
is there this great urge to raise taxes 
right 
now? 
Why 
tear 
down 
what 
worked? Why put America in a position 
where we are paying higher and higher 
taxes as a percent of our economy? 
Contributing to this revenue growth, 
the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office 
projects that corporate tax receipts are 
going to climb to $379 billion in 2023, or 
1.5 percent of GDP. According to the 
Tax Foundation, this will be ‘‘a record 
high in nominal terms’’—so that $379 
billion will be a record high in cor-
porate 
tax 
receipts—‘‘and 
nearly 
matching average corporate tax collec-
tions as a share of GDP’’ prior to the 
2017 tax reform. So, again, I just ask 
people to think about this. 
They say: Well, we need to tax com-
panies more. Remember, you are tax-
ing workers, according to the analysis 
of the Tax Foundation and the Con-
gressional Budget Office. But, also,

those receipts are going to be at record 
levels and very close to, as a percent of 
the economy, where they were before 
the 2017 tax reform. 
What we should take away from 
these findings is that the economy is 
growing as we come out of this pan-
demic. We know this to be true. We 
have known it for months, really. 
The Congressional Budget Office pro-
jected way back in January that with-
out any additional government help— 
no new COVID–19 packages, not includ-
ing the $1.9 trillion spending package 
that Congress passed in March—that 
the economy would fully recover by 
midyear. And they were right, even as 
much of that spending has not gone out 
yet from the $1.9 trillion. 
Payroll tax revenue has risen by 
about 4 percent, suggesting that work-
ers are taking home bigger paychecks 
than before. 
So the economy is beginning a nice 
recovery. We need it to continue. The 
last thing you want to do is to slap a 
bunch of taxes on the economy right 
now and have the economy go down 
and have workers, in particular, bear 
the brunt of that. 
My question is: Why would you want 
to throw out a tax code that has helped 
fuel this unprecedented economic re-
covery 
we 
saw 
prepandemic 
and 
brought in more money in the process? 
In 2017, with this tax reform, we 
helped usher in an economy powered by 
workers and powered by small busi-
nesses and powered by more competi-
tive larger businesses. It wasn’t pow-
ered by big spending here in Wash-
ington, DC. The results worked. It was 
truly historic. 
Moving ahead, let’s stay the course 
instead of hiking taxes and putting a 
damper on American prosperity and 
American opportunity for everybody to 
get ahead. A massive tax increase 
won’t make us build back better. A 
massive tax increase will tear down 
what makes us better. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to speak in support of 
very important new legislation, the 
Freedom to Vote Act, that I introduced 
yesterday with the members of the 
Voting Rights Working Group assem-
bled by Leader SCHUMER, which in-
cludes 
Senator 
MANCHIN; 
Senator 
MERKLEY, who is here with us today on 
the floor and who has been such a lead-
er on voting issues, including the For 
the People Act; Senator PADILLA; and 
Senators KING, KAINE, TESTER, and 
WARNOCK. 
The freedom to vote is fundamental 
to all of our freedoms. Following the 
2020 elections in which more Americans 
voted than ever before, in the middle of 
a public health crisis, we have seen un-
precedented attacks on our democracy 
in States across the country. These at-
tacks demand an immediate Federal 
response. 
The Freedom to Vote Act will set 
basic national standards to make sure 
all Americans can cast their ballots in 
the way that works best for them, re-
gardless of what ZIP Code they live in. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER for 
his leadership in pulling together our 
working group that got this legislation 
across the finish line and, as I men-
tioned, 
Senators 
MERKLEY
and 
MANCHIN for their work on this crucial 
bill. 
It has been over 8 months since that 
violent 
mob 
of 
insurrectionists 
stormed through this very spot and 
desecrated our Capitol, the temple of 
our democracy. They opened the desks 
in this Chamber. They got up and sat 
at that desk where you are sitting now, 
Mr. President. It was an attack on our 
Republic. 
And as I said from the inaugural 
stage just 2 weeks later under that 
beautiful blue sky, at the very place 
where you could still see the spray 
paint at the bottom of the columns and 
the makeshift windows behind us, 
‘‘This is the day our democracy picks 
itself up, brushes off the dust, and does 
what America always does: goes for-
ward as a nation, under God, indivis-
ible, with liberty and justice for all.’’ 
We took back our democracy that 
day with Democrats, Republicans, and 
Independents all sitting at that plat-
form, seeing a new President and Vice 
President be inaugurated. We took 
back our democracy that day, and we 
will take it back this day with this new 
bill, with the support of 78 percent of 
Americans who favor 2 weeks of early 
voting, a very important provision in 
this bill, and 83 percent of voters who 
support public disclosures of all con-
tributions. We will take it back again 
from those who are trying to take 
away people’s constitutional right to 
vote. 
With over 400 bills introduced in 
nearly every State to limit the free-
dom to vote, we can’t simply sit back 
and watch our democracy be threat-
ened again. Whether it is threatened 
with bear spray and crowbars and axes 
or long lines or the elimination of bal-
lot boxes or the secret money, it is still 
under siege. When we are faced with a 
coordinated effort across the country 
to limit the freedom to vote, we must 
stand up and do what is right. 
Sometimes people say: What is going 
on? It worked so well during the pan-
demic, during a public health crisis. 
More people voted than ever before. 
Well, that is because they voted by 
mail. That is because some States, 
both blue States and red States, 
changed their laws to make it easier to 
vote, while still protecting the sanctity 
of the vote. 
So why is this happening? Well, I 
think 
our 
colleague 
Senator 
Rev. 
RAPHAEL WARNOCK put it best when he 
said: ‘‘Some people don’t want some 
people to vote.’’ We will not stand for 
that because that is not how a democ-
racy works. 
Leader SCHUMER
has said he will 
bring this new bill to a vote as soon as 
next week because we know our democ-
racy cannot wait. This bill builds on 
the framework put forward by Senator 
MANCHIN in June and includes many of 
the key reforms in the For the People 
Act, guaranteeing all Americans, as I 
noted, access to at least 15 days of 
early voting, including weekends. 
Look at what just happened in Geor-
gia. We just had a field hearing down 
there with the Rules Committee. In 
Georgia, all of a sudden they passed a 
law that says, yeah, you can vote on 
weekends early on, but when it counts 
in a runoff period, in those last 28 days, 
you can’t vote on weekends anymore. 
That is only done for one reason: to 
make it harder for people to vote. That 
is why this bill is so important. 
What else does it do? It ensures that 
all voters can cast a mail-in ballot and 
makes it easier to register to vote. 
That is pretty important as we see Re-
publican, Democrat, and Independent 
voters all across this country wanting 
to be able to cast mail-in ballots. It is 
the safest way for so many of them to 
vote, even today. 
Some States even required them to 
get a notary signature in the middle of 
a pandemic, through a glass window, 
when they were in the hospital. You 
wonder why we want to have some Fed-
eral minimum standards in place. 
What else? Increased transparency 
through the DISCLOSE Act. I already 
noted that over 80 percent of people in 
this country want to see that, whether 
they are Democrats, Republicans, or 
Independents. It would require super- 
PACs and issue advocacy groups to dis-
close donors who contribute more than 
$10,000 and stop the use of transfers be-
tween organizations to cloak the iden-
tity, to hide the identity of the source 
of those contributions. 
It would counter partisan inter-
ference in election administration and 
protect election officials because not 
only do we need to make sure people 
can vote, we need to make sure their 
vote is counted. 
It would prevent voter purges by re-
quiring States to use objective and re-
liable evidence to remove voters and 
prohibit the targeting of voters solely 
because they haven’t voted recently, 
while giving election administrators 
flexibility to remove voters based on 
State records. 
As Stacey Abrams has said, if you 
don’t go to a meeting for a while, do 
you lose your right to assemble? No, 
you don’t. If you don’t go to a church 
or a synagogue or a mosque for a while, 
do you lose your right to exercise your 
right to religion? No, you don’t. You 
shouldn’t lose your right to vote. 
It would also prohibit partisan gerry-
mandering, this bill will, so that voters 
choose their elected officials, not the 
other way around. 
Now, my home State of Minnesota is 
a great example of how this can all 
work. When you make it easier for peo-
ple to vote, they will vote. I never see 
this as a partisan issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6520 
September 15, 2021 
In election after election, our State 
leads the Nation in voter turnout be-
cause we have things like, now, no-ex-
cuse voting by mail or 46 days of early 
voting. Our bill doesn’t go that far be-
cause we are setting minimum stand-
ards, but that is what we have in our 
State—and same-day voter registra-
tion. 
And what has happened as a result? 
High voter turnout every time. Whom 
have we elected? Well, we have elected 
Democratic Governors like our Gov-
ernor, Tim Walz; we have elected Re-
publican Governors like Tim Pawlenty; 
and we have elected Independents like 
Jesse Ventura. But what have I no-
ticed? People feel like they are part of 
the democracy because we make it 
easier for them to vote. 
These policies that ensure Minneso-
tans continue to hold the coveted title 
of first in voter turnout—very close to 
the Presiding Officer’s State of Colo-
rado—are overseen by our secretary of 
state, Steve Simon, who continues to 
push for improvements in our elec-
tions. 
The freedom to vote is fundamental 
to all our freedoms. Protecting it has 
not always been easy. Throughout our 
country’s 245-year history, we have had 
to course correct and take action to 
ensure that our democracy for the peo-
ple, by the people actually lives up to 
its ideals. 
Voting is how Americans control 
their government and hold elected offi-
cials accountable. It was the founding 
principle of our country, and it has 
stood the test of wars, economic strife, 
and a global pandemic. But as we have 
seen in States like Georgia, Florida, 
Iowa, Montana, and most recently 
Texas, we are up against a coordinated 
attack aimed at limiting the freedom 
to vote. This demands a Federal re-
sponse. 
And the Constitution could not be 
clearer. It says right there that Con-
gress can make or alter laws regarding 
Federal elections. 
Just last week, legislation in Texas 
was signed into law that makes it 
harder to vote, and many States al-
ready are underway drawing new con-
gressional maps. Without this bill, 
there will be nothing to limit many 
States from drawing gerrymandered 
maps that will distort the voices of 
Americans not just for 1 year but for 
the next decade. 
The urgency for a Federal response is 
why, as chairwoman of the Senate 
Rules Committee, I have worked to en-
sure that voting rights are a priority. 
It is why one of our first hearings this 
year was on the For the People Act and 
why—and I see Reverend Warnock 
here—we took the Rules Committee on 
the road to Georgia in its first field 
hearing in 20 years. 
And just last month, Senator BALD-
WIN and I held a roundtable discussion 
in Wisconsin on what has been hap-
pening in that State and what would 
have been put into law, including only 
having one ballot dropoff box in the en-
tire city of Milwaukee if the Governor 
hadn’t stood in and vetoed it. 
And we are not done yet because 
these discussions with voters are the 
most 
pressing 
testament 
that 
the 
threat to the freedom to vote is very 
real and affecting people of all walks of 
life across the country. We can’t sit 
back idly and watch our democracy be 
threatened. As President Biden said in 
Philadelphia, the fight to protect the 
right to vote is the ‘‘test of our time.’’ 
Americans have fought and died to 
protect this freedom, and 56 years after 
the Voting Rights Act was passed by 
this Chamber and signed into law, we 
are still continuing this fight. 
We have asked our colleagues from 
the other side of the aisle to join us on 
this bill. We have made many, many, 
many changes to this legislation in re-
sponse to concerns they have raised, in 
response to concerns Senator MANCHIN 
raised, in response to concerns that 
secretaries of state have made across 
the country. We have adapted this bill 
to make it much easier to implement 
in rural areas, in small towns. 
We are proud of this legislation. Yet 
what do we hear from the other side of 
the aisle? Well, over the last few 
months, one of their refrains which I 
find so amusing is they say this will 
somehow result in chaos. Truly? 
Chaos is a 5-hour wait to vote in the 
Sun in Georgia without food or water. 
Chaos is purging eligible voters from 
voter rolls and prohibiting mail-in bal-
lot drop boxes and having only one in 
the entirety of Harris County in Texas 
for 5 million people. Chaos is voters in 
Wisconsin waiting in line to vote for 
hours in the rain, wearing homemade 
face masks and plastic garbage bags. 
That angry mob on January 6 that 
came right into this Chamber, that was 
chaos. 
You want to stop the chaos: Federal 
minimum voting standards. Telling ex-
tremists they can’t spend millions on 
sham audits, that stops the chaos. Get-
ting dark money out of our politics, 
that stops the chaos. And making sure 
that people have a voice by ending par-
tisan gerrymandering, that stops the 
chaos. 
So, once again, I urge my Republican 
colleagues to recognize the work being 
done in many of their own States to re-
strict the freedom of Americans to ex-
ercise their sacred right to vote. Our 
Nation was founded on the ideals of de-
mocracy, and as we have seen for our-
selves in this very building, we cannot 
afford to take it for granted. 
We have so much work to do. Voting 
rights reform, this bill, guaranteeing 
the freedom to vote, is about the salva-
tion of our very democracy. I urge my 
colleagues to join us in supporting the 
Freedom to Vote Act. 
Mr. President, I see my colleagues. 
Senator MERKLEY, such a great leader 
on the For the People bill, and Senator 
WARNOCK, such a great leader, new in 
the Senate but already establishing 
himself across the country and in Geor-
gia as a leader on voting rights, are 
both here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I so 
much appreciate the words of my col-
league 
from 
Minnesota, 
who 
has 
brought the Rules Committee to bear 
in a maximum capacity to fight to de-
fend the freedom to vote for all Ameri-
cans. 
When I was in high school, I had the 
opportunity to live in West Africa 
under a dictatorship as an exchange 
student. And in that country, the mili-
tary dictatorship would exist until 
there was a new military coup, and 
then there would be another military 
dictatorship. And that happened time 
after time after time. 
So, as a 16-year-old, I saw the con-
trast between a nation where citizens 
had no voice in the future of their 
country versus the United States of 
America, where the foundation of our 
Republic, the core vision of our Nation 
is that each citizen has the oppor-
tunity to participate, to fight to help 
shape the American dream, the path 
into the future, to the benefit of a bet-
ter nation. 
President Johnson noted that the 
ballot box is so essential that ‘‘the vote 
is the most powerful instrument ever 
devised . . . for breaking down injus-
tice.’’ Really, that ballot box is the 
pulsating heart of our democracy. 
President 
Lincoln, 
when 
he 
was 
speaking at Gettysburg—speaking that 
the soldiers who died there did not die 
in vain because they fought to preserve 
the vision of government of, by, and for 
the people, that it shall not perish 
from this Earth. Well, it is the vote 
that preserves the vision of govern-
ment of, by, and for the people. It is 
free access to the ballot box. 
Over the course of our history, we 
have sought to fulfill that vision 
through the 13th and 14th Amend-
ments, through the 15th Amendment, 
through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
But here we find, at this moment in 
our history, the right to vote is under 
attack once again. Some 18 States have 
passed some 30 laws trying to target 
specific groups of individuals and pre-
vent them from being able to vote. 
These strategies in State after State 
are to make it harder to vote and easi-
er to cheat. 
Well, I will tell you what this bill 
does that we are talking about today, 
the Freedom to Vote bill. It makes it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat. It 
takes on three key forms of corruption 
that are haunting our election system. 
First, it takes on dark money—dark 
money unleashed by Citizens United 
that allows billionaires to buy elec-
tions around this country. 
Do a poll of Democrats, Republicans, 
and Independents and ask ‘‘Should we 
have this dark money, source un-
known, haunting our election system, 
producing all of those attack ads, and 
you have no idea where they came 
from?’’ and citizens of every political 
stripe will say ‘‘Absolutely not.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6521 
September 15, 2021 
Dark money, the hidden manipula-
tion of the elections by the powerful— 
buying these vast sets of television ads, 
trying to destroy the character of can-
didates in order to manipulate the out-
come—should not exist. It is in the 
DNA of Americans that this is a cor-
rupting force. Well, this bill takes on 
the dark money. 
The second thing that it takes on is 
gerrymandering. 
Gerrymandering 
is 
where districts are drawn to favor one 
political party over the other. Ask 
Americans across this country ‘‘Is it 
right that politicians should choose 
their voters rather than voters choos-
ing their politicians?’’ and they will 
say ‘‘No.’’ Ask if they believe in the vi-
sion of equal representation as a key to 
a just society, and they will say yes. 
They want equal representation. Re-
publicans say yes. Democrats say yes. 
Independents say yes. 
This bill takes on gerrymandering 
and puts an end to it with national 
standards for redistricting. 
Now, let’s turn to the ballot box. I 
never thought I would live to see the 
day that we go into a time machine 
and return to before 1965, in which one 
of the two parties is determined to 
block targeted groups from voting—to 
target Black Americans from voting, 
Hispanic Americans from voting, low- 
income Americans from voting, college 
students from voting. This is com-
pletely un-American. This is racist. It 
is a past that we had proudly put be-
hind us, but this bigoted past has aris-
en to haunt us once again in these 
some 30 laws in some 18 States, tar-
geting specific groups of Americans. 
This bill says that strategy of cheat-
ing on election day by trying to block 
targeted groups from voting will not 
stand. We will make it easier to reg-
ister. That is what this bill does. We 
will make it easier to vote before elec-
tion day to undermine those election- 
day shenanigans. We will have 15 days 
of early voting. We will have the oppor-
tunity for voting by mail. We will 
make sure that our I.D. laws are not 
used in a fashion to favor one party 
over the other. These are core protec-
tions against these strategies designed 
to disenfranchise Americans and ma-
nipulate the outcome of elections. 
I will tell you what else this law 
does. It takes on election subversion. 
We have seen strategies of election 
subversion in many of those State 
laws. So this bill says: You know what. 
No, you cannot have frivolous chal-
lenges where one person stands at a 
poll and challenges the legitimacy of 
every single person who comes into 
that poll place in order to make it hard 
for people in a certain location to vote. 
It protects election officials from im-
proper removal. It protects election 
workers from intimidation and harass-
ment. It preserves election records so 
they cannot be manipulated. It guaran-
tees that we have paper ballots that 
can be recounted. It prevents observer 
interference in the elections. It makes 
sure that people in line, if something 
terrible should happen and those lines 
are long, will still be able to have ac-
cess to water and food, which is a 
strategy that has been now employed 
by several States, to say: You know 
what. On election day, we are going to 
make sure targeted precincts have long 
lines, and then we are going to say you 
can’t even get a sip of water from a 
friend in that line, in order to try to 
stop people from voting. 
Wow—the lengths these Republican 
house, statehouse, and State senators 
and Governors are going to stop people 
from voting. We have seen the strate-
gies in the past. We have seen elimi-
nating the number of precinct voting 
locations to make it harder for tar-
geted areas to vote. We have seen lo-
cating them in new locations to con-
fuse people. We have seen false infor-
mation put out about where the loca-
tions are to make it harder to vote. We 
have seen the understaffing of key 
places to create long lines. Well, early 
voting, vote-by-mail, and protections 
in this bill stop these efforts to cheat 
in elections across our country. 
So we are defending that most power-
ful instrument ever devised by human 
beings for breaking down injustice with 
this Freedom to Vote bill. We are de-
fending the right of every American to 
cast a ballot. We are fighting against 
the big three corruptions infesting, if 
you will, our election system across 
the country. This should be passed 100 
to 0. 
I invite my Republican colleagues to 
remember the oath they took to the 
Constitution and to remember that the 
right to vote is at the very heart of 
that Constitution and join us in these 
core protections and to pass the Free-
dom to Vote Act on the floor of the 
Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I am 
proud to stand on the Senate floor 
today with my colleagues Senator KLO-
BUCHAR and Senator MERKLEY in sup-
port of the new Freedom to Vote Act 
that we just introduced. I want to talk 
about why it is so important, so urgent 
that Congress act right now to protect 
the sacred right to vote that is under 
assault across our Nation, but first I 
want to thank my friends who worked 
with me to get us to this point: Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, who has worked on 
this issue for so long; Senator MERKLEY 
also; Senator MANCHIN; and Senators 
SCHUMER, PADILLA, KAINE, KING, and 
TESTER. Our work is a testament to 
Democrats’ commitment to protecting 
access to the ballot box for every eligi-
ble voter. 
I think it is important to remind us 
that we were blocked from debating 
this issue in June. It bears repeating so 
that the American people understand 
that that is what got stopped in June— 
not the actual bill but the ability to 
debate the bill on the Senate floor. But 
I am proud that our group was able to 
come together. We decided that we 
were not about to let this fight to pro-
tect voting rights die in this Congress. 
Passing voting rights is the most im-
portant thing we can do in this Con-
gress because if we are going to length-
en and strengthen the cords of our de-
mocracy, that won’t just happen. We 
will have to work for it. We will have 
to fight for it. We will have to stand up 
for it. And that is what we intend to 
do. 
That is why we worked on this bill 
through the negotiations on the bipar-
tisan infrastructure deal. That work is 
very important. I have often said re-
garding our infrastructure work that 
America needs a home improvement 
project; that that work is not only an 
infrastructure bill, it is a jobs bill des-
perately needed. We have to build back 
better and create infrastructure so 
that families can thrive, so that work-
ers can be engaged in the work that 
grows our economy, creates more jobs. 
But even while that work was going 
forward during the August recess, we 
were focused on writing this bill. 
The Freedom to Vote Act will im-
prove access to the ballot for all eligi-
ble Americans by setting national 
standards for absentee voting, early 
voting, and in-person voting. It will 
make sure that the drop box is avail-
able for workers. It will enable the 
work that is so necessary to strengthen 
our democracy. 
This bill will end partisan gerry-
mandering—yet another way in which 
the voices of ordinary people are 
squeezed out of their democracy—and 
it will advance commonsense reforms 
to secure our elections. 
I am especially proud that this bill 
specifically addresses the wave of voter 
suppression laws we have seen take 
root in my home State of Georgia and 
all across this country since January. 
What kind of Congress would we be if 
we did not respond to all of these voter 
suppression bills that are mushrooming 
all over the country; a violent insur-
rection on this very Capitol, driven by 
the Big Lie, metastasized into a kind of 
voter suppression cancer all across the 
body politic? 
This is our moment, and this is the 
work that we must do. So I am proud 
that this bill includes provisions from 
my Preventing Election Subversion 
Act that will prevent what we are see-
ing in places like Fulton County, GA, 
right now, where partisan actors will 
interfere with the work of local offi-
cials, taking over the election, sub-
verting the will of the people even 
while the votes are still being cast. 
It will also prevent a neighbor from 
leveraging baseless challenges to a vot-
er’s ability to cast a ballot and have it 
counted. Imagine that. And that is one 
of the provisions in SB 202 down in 
Georgia. Your neighbor can decide to 
challenge countless numbers of people 
and their right and legitimacy in cast-
ing their ballots—tie up the whole sys-
tem with these kinds of baseless accu-
sations. How will it be possible to cer-
tify any election? 
Simply put, the Freedom to Vote Act 
is all about securing our elections and

making the ballot box accessible so 
that every eligible American can exer-
cise that basic right, the right to vote, 
no matter where they live. 
As we do this work, as challenging as 
it is, as disappointing as it was to have 
our beloved colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle block debate, I am not 
discouraged in this moment. I am en-
couraged by the voices and the legacy 
of those who committed to the idea of 
freedom. 
John Lewis was my parishioner, and 
although he has transitioned to eter-
nity, his advice still echoes in the Halls 
of this Congress. 
Every Member of this Chamber ought 
to be able to get behind voting rights. 
It is the only reason we are here in the 
first place. I hope my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle will cosponsor 
and support the Freedom to Vote Act. 
I look forward to talking with Demo-
crats and Republicans about how we 
can get this done while we continue 
working on economic and infrastruc-
ture packages, because we have to walk 
and chew gum at the same time. We 
have to repair our country’s infrastruc-
ture, but we also have to protect and 
repair the infrastructure of our democ-
racy. It is not either/or; it is both/and. 
We have always had infrastructure. 
We have always had roads and streets— 
important. 
We 
have 
always 
had 
bridges. John Lewis walked across a 
bridge in order to repair the infrastruc-
ture of our democracy, a bridge to the 
future. 
I know that some of my friends on 
the other side of the aisle are already 
saying that they are not going to sup-
port this bill, but in the past, I remind 
them, voting rights legislation has 
passed out of this Chamber with strong 
bipartisan support. 
I hope that this day will be no dif-
ferent. I say, at least give this bill a 
chance. Come, let us reason together. 
Let’s talk about it. Let’s have the vot-
ing rights discussion that we didn’t 
have in June. It is not too late. Let’s 
have the discussion that the American 
people deserve. Let’s have an open de-
bate and input from both sides here on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is 
why we were sent here. 
There is a lot for my Republican 
friends to like in this bill. My Demo-
cratic colleagues and I stand ready to 
hear what you don’t like. Together, we 
can try to find common ground. I hope 
my Republican friends will give this 
bill fair consideration and that we can 
get bipartisan support to get it over 
the finish line. 
Mr. President, as I close, I want to 
remind all of us that the only reason 
we are here in this Chamber at all is 
because somebody voted for us. Voting 
rights is not just some other issue 
alongside other issues. It gets to the 
heart of who we are in the first place— 
a democracy. We will always disagree 
about a whole range of issues, but after 
politicians have argued their case 
about 
infrastructure, 
about 
taxes, 
about healthcare, about national secu-
rity, the most powerful words ever ut-
tered in a democracy are ‘‘the people 
have spoken.’’ Shame on us if we allow 
the people’s voices to be silenced in 
this Chamber. 
Voting rights are preservative of all 
other rights, and right now the right to 
vote is under attack. Our democracy is 
in a 9–1–1 emergency, and we must act 
now. 
I know that for those who have been 
in this body for a while, there is a 
sense in which you know you offer up 
proposals and they don’t always make 
it and you live and you fight another 
day. 
When I look at what is going on 
across our country, I think that if we 
don’t address what is happening right 
now, we will cross a Rubicon that im-
perils our democracy for years to come. 
I am not about to sit here silently 
and allow that to happen. Too many 
people died. Too much blood was shed. 
Too many sacrifices were made. Too 
much is at stake, and it is beneath the 
legacy of the greatest deliberative 
body on the planet to refuse to even 
have a debate about voting rights. 
I hope that my beloved colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle will come 
and reason together. Let’s pass this out 
of this Chamber with strong support. 
We got some things done this year, but 
I believe that if we don’t pass voting 
rights, history will rightly judge us 
harshly. 
Folks who sent us here are counting 
on us. History is waiting on us. Our 
children are watching us. And the 
great cloud of witnesses—John Lewis; a 
white woman named Viola Liuzzo, who 
died fighting for voting rights; Abra-
ham Joshua Heschel; Medgar Evers—a 
great cloud of witnesses are urging us 
on to march toward the mark of the 
High Calling, the High Calling about 
our democratic ideals, a nation where 
every voice is heard and every vote 
counts. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am very 
proud to stand with my colleagues on 
the floor to talk about the Freedom to 
Vote Act. I was proud to work with my 
colleagues over many months—really, 
my purpose beginning in May—to help 
negotiate the bill to a place where it 
could do what needs to be done to ac-
complish the objectives my colleagues 
have described so well. 
I want to offer just a few words from 
the heart about why I am so impas-
sioned about getting this bill done. By 
my count, there have been 1,994 people 
who have served in the U.S. Senate— 
1,994. 
One hundred of us share a unique ex-
perience. One hundred of us were here 
on the only day in the history of this 
body when we were attacked by violent 
insurrectionists attempting to disrupt 
the peaceful transfer of power. So from 
whatever State we represent or what-
ever our background, we are unified in 
having shared an experience never to 
be imagined, never to be forgotten, and 
never to be repeated. 
I believe the fact that we shared this 
experience together with the Senate 
staff who were here with us, this puts a 
unique responsibility on our shoulders. 
First, let’s understand what that day 
was about, that there are some who are 
trying to kind of downplay it—it was 
tourists visiting. We can laugh that off 
because we know that wasn’t the case. 
There are others who are trying to 
downplay it in other ways—it was a 
riot, it was a protest, even that it was 
a violent protest. That is not what it 
was. 
If it had happened on January 5, it 
would have been a violent protest. If it 
had happened on January 7, it would 
have been a violent protest. But it 
didn’t happen on January 5. It didn’t 
happen on January 7. It happened on a 
day established by law, at a time estab-
lished by law, for a purpose established 
by law to disrupt that purpose. 
It was a violent protest organized 
and inflamed by a President to occur at 
precisely the moment that the Con-
gress of the United States was carrying 
out the constitutional duty to certify 
the election of Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS as President and Vice President 
of the United States. 
It was designed to disrupt that cer-
tification, and it succeeded. For 5 or 6 
hours, we were locked out of the Cham-
ber while the rampagers tried to stop 
the certification of the election. We 
were barricaded in the midst of the 
peak of the COVID pandemic side by 
side with staff in a room as the insur-
rectionists tried to disrupt the peaceful 
transfer of power. 
Those words ‘‘peaceful transfer of 
power,’’ ‘‘disrupting,’’ what does that 
mean? 
Let’s unpack it further. It was an ef-
fort to disenfranchise more than 80 
million people in this country who had 
voted for Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS. It was the single largest effort to 
disenfranchise voters in the history of 
the United States. That is what hap-
pened as we were barricaded first in 
this building. 
And how glad I am that you pages 
were not here. How glad I am I told my 
staff not to come to work that day. No 
one should have had to experience that. 
But it was an effort that succeeded for 
a period of hours to disenfranchise 
more than 80 million people. 
Here is a powerful story. On that day, 
we knew who had been elected Presi-
dent and Vice President. We knew what 
the House majority would be, but we 
did not know what the Senate majority 
would be. The Senate majority wasn’t 
clear in November, and it wasn’t clear 
in December, and it wasn’t even clear 
on January 5, when my colleague who 
just spoke, from Georgia, had his race 
called that he had won a special elec-
tion in Georgia. As we were under at-
tack, it was still in doubt as to who 
would be the majority party in the U.S. 
Senate. 
As we were barricaded for hours in 
the midst of COVID in a room, side by

side with television monitors showing 
us what was happening at the Capitol, 
there then came a breaking news re-
port that the last Senate race had been 
called in Georgia for JON OSSOFF, and 
so Democrats would now have a Senate 
majority. 
I am a religious person. Things hap-
pen for a reason. It was unclear who 
would be the leadership in the Senate. 
But in the midst of a pandemic that 
had unnecessarily killed 600,000 Ameri-
cans, and now with an ongoing attack 
against the Capitol of the United 
States—unique in American history— 
by people trying to disenfranchise 80 
million people, the news suddenly 
came: We want new leadership. We 
need new leadership. 
There is a reason for that. There is a 
reason that it happened in the middle 
of this attack. We have a burden on our 
shoulders to live up to the responsi-
bility that we—100—uniquely share. 
That responsibility is to make sure 
that no voter—not 80 million, not 10 
million, not a million, not 10, not 1— 
that no voter is disenfranchised in this 
country. 
That is why we have been given this 
unique opportunity to lead at this mo-
ment in time. That is what being vic-
timized by that attack means in terms 
of our responsibility to this country 
and to our history. We have to carry 
out that responsibility. 
Now, if this were a Hollywood film, 
what would happen is the Democrats 
get the majority, and then all of a sud-
den we put to rest disenfranchise-
ment—Democratic majority, we can 
stop the disenfranchisement of voters. 
But, no, the Big Lie didn’t stop. The 
Big Lie didn’t stop when we found out 
we had the majority. And this is often 
the case in powerful stories in human 
history. Like, you know, when Moses 
leads folks through the Red Sea to the 
other side, it is not all great as soon as 
they get there. They still have work to 
do. 
We got the majority, but we have 
work to do because in State after State 
after State, as my colleagues indi-
cated, legislators in States where there 
are Republican Governors and Repub-
lican legislative Houses have thrown 
up one burden after the next to dis-
enfranchise people, just as there was an 
effort to disenfranchise 80 million on 
January 6. 
Let me be clear. These State legisla-
tors, they may not be wearing ‘‘Camp 
Auschwitz’’ T-shirts. They may not be 
carrying 
Confederate 
flags 
around. 
They may not be beating up police offi-
cers with flag poles or fence rails, but 
they are acting out of the same Big Lie 
that President Trump repeated ad nau-
seam when he encouraged people to 
come and be wild at the U.S. Capitol to 
overturn 
the 
peaceful 
transfer 
of 
power. 
And so the States are embracing 
these strategies so well described by 
my colleagues to make it harder for 
people to vote, to enable partisan poli-
ticians to take the power to count 
votes away from electoral officials if 
they don’t like what that count would 
show, to even criminalize people who 
are trying to help their neighbors vote. 
Imagine this: making it a crime to 
give somebody water as they are wait-
ing to vote, a crime punishable by up 
to a $1,000 fine, by up to a year in jail. 
This is the same Big Lie tactic that led 
to the attack on this body, and it is 
happening all over this country. There 
is a burden uniquely on our shoulders, 
if we were paying attention on January 
6, to stand boldly to stop it and to stop 
it once and for all. 
That is what the Freedom to Vote 
Act is about. It is about ensuring that 
these mass efforts of disenfranchise-
ment, which reached their most vivid 
and flowering in the violent attack on 
our Capitol, don’t occur and that peo-
ple have the ability to get access to a 
ballot and to have confidence that 
their ballots will be counted with in-
tegrity and that weird schemes and 
stunts and penalties and criminal pun-
ishment won’t be thrown in their paths 
by one high hurdle after the next to 
keep them from participating in a de-
mocracy that we proudly proclaim our-
selves to be. That is why I am so proud 
to be one of the cosponsors of this bill 
with my colleagues. 
I was a civil rights lawyer for 17 
years. You might think that is why I 
like this bill. No. The thing that makes 
me passionate about the bill is I was an 
eyewitness to the biggest disenfran-
chisement effort in the history of the 
United States, and I don’t think we can 
say: Yes, we were here, and we were 
eyewitnesses to it. It happened to us 
and the people we care about, but there 
is nothing we can do. 
We can’t say, after having seen what 
we have seen and done what we have 
done and been where we have been, 
that there is nothing we can do. We 
can’t. We have to act. 
Let me just conclude and say this: I 
have been on 10 ballots and been sworn 
into office many times as a city coun-
cilman, as a mayor, as a Lieutenant 
Governor, as a Governor, and as a U.S. 
Senator. When you get sworn in, you 
always say some version of this—it 
varies slightly in local and State of-
fice, as the Presiding Officer knows, 
who was also a mayor and a Governor, 
and it also has some version of this 
within it—a pledge to support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic. 
I had an epiphany in the days after 
January 6, and the epiphany was this: 
When I would take that oath of office, 
it was just kind of like the thing you 
would say so you could do your job. If 
you had asked me, ‘‘Hey, Senator 
Kaine,’’ or ‘‘Hey, Governor Kaine,’’ or 
‘‘Hey, Councilman Kaine, what is your 
job?’’ I would have given you a job de-
scription, 
and 
the 
job 
description 
would have been that I want to build 
schools; that I want to make sure that 
our troops have the resources they 
need to keep our country safe. I mean, 
I always had a job description in my 
mind. I have been in elected office for 
27 years now. I have always had a job 
description in my mind: education, 
healthcare, defense—the next thing on 
my ‘‘to do’’ list. I always had a job de-
scription in my mind. 
Never did I think, until after Janu-
ary 6, that my oath of office was my 
job description. We say that oath of of-
fice, and we sometimes don’t think 
about it. No. That oath of office is my 
job description, and I am kind of sorry 
that it took me 27 years to figure that 
out: to support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Those who would disenfranchise 80 mil-
lion or those who would disenfranchise 
1 are domestic enemies of the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
I have pledged to support and defend 
that Constitution. This bill—the de-
bate that we will have and the vote 
that we will have—is a test of whether 
we mean what we say. I so look for-
ward to engaging in this most impor-
tant debate with my colleagues in the 
days to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, before 
I begin, I ask unanimous consent to de-
liver a portion of my remarks in Span-
ish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, in 
Spanish, we say ‘‘en Espanol,’’ but I 
know the Presiding Officer knew that 
from Colorado. 
I rise today, as we mark the begin-
ning of Hispanic Heritage Month, to re-
flect on a historic leader whose work 
inspires me in this fight for voting 
rights and the work that we have be-
fore us. 
Willie Velasquez, recipient of the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, dedi-
cated his life to improving the freedom 
to vote in Latino communities. 
Everywhere he went, he brought a 
simple motto. You might have heard it. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
‘‘Your vote is your voice.’’ 
Willie Velasquez was born in 1944 and 
grew up in a Latino community in 
Texas which suffered from the harms of 
segregation, redlining, and government 
neglect. He understood that the path to 
greater recognition for Latinos was 
through participation in our democ-
racy. So Willie set out to make sure 
Latinos across the Southwest could 
participate. 
In 1974, Willie Velasquez founded his 
groundbreaking 
organization, 
the 
Southwest Voter Registration Edu-
cation Project. Through his efforts, 
Willie helped bring the vote—and a 
powerful voice—to many Latino com-
munities. 
Now, Willie’s successes were built on 
the hard-earned victories of those of 
past civil rights leaders. Especially 
critical was Congress’s 1975 extension

of the Voting Rights Act—yes, a bipar-
tisan reauthorization of the Federal 
Voting Rights Act—which established 
protections for language minorities, 
like Spanish speakers. In just 10 years, 
with Willie’s and other activists’ hard 
work on the ground, the number of 
Latinos registered to vote nearly dou-
bled, and in the same 10 years, the 
number of Latinos holding elected of-
fice also nearly doubled. 
That is the power of the freedom to 
vote and the power of what we can do 
here in the Senate and here in Con-
gress—give every American a voice in 
our democracy. 
Now, in his time, Willie fought to do 
exactly this, like the generations of 
Americans of all ages, colors, creeds, 
and genders who came before him. 
Their efforts reflect a fundamental 
truth about our country: We are 
stronger when more Americans can 
vote, and we are stronger when all 
communities have a say in govern-
ment. But the path to realizing our 
highest ideals has never been easy. 
From a convention hall in Seneca Falls 
to a bridge in Selma, from Willie’s 
home in San Antonio, TX, to this very 
Chamber, the voting rights’ victories of 
each generation have been hard-fought 
and hard-won, and it is no different 
today. 
In recent months, we have seen the 
latest challenge to the core of our de-
mocracy: scores of new laws proposed 
by Republican State legislatures to 
target the past five decades of gains in 
voting 
rights; 
cynical 
politicians, 
spreading false claims of voter fraud 
because they fear losing in a fair elec-
tion. You can see the danger of it even 
in my home State of California where, 
just yesterday, we held a recall elec-
tion. Republicans ran a campaign of 
disinformation, 
spreading 
baseless 
claims of massive voter fraud before 
the polls even closed, before they even 
opened, and long before a single ballot 
was even counted. It is straight out of 
Donald Trump’s playbook—the same 
playbook that perpetuated the Big Lie 
and fueled the domestic terrorism that 
the world witnessed on January 6. 
It is no coincidence that the cynical 
claims of voter fraud are often targeted 
at communities of color. In the face of 
these challenges, we must overcome, 
together, again. We must renew our 
collective fight for our democracy. It is 
up to us. The time is now to get the job 
done. 
It is an honor to lead the Freedom to 
Vote Act alongside my colleagues Sen-
ators KLOBUCHAR, MERKLEY, WARNOCK, 
MANCHIN, KING, TESTER, and KAINE. 
The Freedom to Vote Act will make 
it easier for all eligible citizens to reg-
ister to vote and to cast their ballots. 
This bill will set a baseline of protec-
tions for voters across the country, 
with commonsense, proven reforms 
that have already been successfully im-
plemented in blue and red States 
across the country. I urge all of my 
colleagues to join us and vote to 
strengthen our democracy. 
As the first Latino to represent Cali-
fornia in this body, in the U.S. Senate, 
I am proud to be spending this Hispanic 
Heritage Month fighting for voting 
rights because so many of our commu-
nity’s 
gains 
have 
been 
achieved 
through political participation and rep-
resentation. The fight to expand voting 
rights is, indeed, part of our heritage. 
It is also a tradition that unites Ameri-
cans because we have come together, 
generation after generation, to expand 
the promise of our democracy for all. 
Yes, we are strongest when every eligi-
ble voter can make their voice heard. 
‘‘Your vote is your voice. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Your vote is your voice.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleagues: Senator PADILLA, 
with your great experience as secretary 
of state and how that has assisted us in 
coming together on this bill; Senator 
WARNOCK, with the passion and first-
hand experience you have in Georgia; 
Senator KAINE, for an extraordinary 
speech, wherein we all had to step back 
and think about our job description: to 
protect and defend the Constitution. It 
is not just ours on this side of the aisle; 
it is also our colleagues’ on the other 
side of the aisle. 
We have this special obligation to 
protect this democracy and to cherish 
it and to pass it on to the next genera-
tion. The way you do that fundamen-
tally is by guaranteeing Americans the 
freedom to vote. That is all this bill is 
about—putting in place minimum na-
tional standards that we see in so 
many of our States but that, sadly, 
right now, are threatened in a number 
of those States for no other reason ex-
cept—to quote Reverend Warnock— 
that some people don’t want some peo-
ple to vote. Our democracy is too im-
portant to let that happen. 
With that, we are going to end our 
segment here, and we will be back to 
discuss this bill more next week.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session and 
be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

HONORING CORPORAL DAEGAN 
WILLIAM-TYELER PAGE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a fallen Marine, 
Cpl Daegan William-Tyeler Page. Cor-
poral Page was a son of the heartland, 
originally from Red Oak, IA, and raised 
in Omaha, NE. He is one of 13 brave 
servicemembers who gave his life in 
service to our country during the evac-
uation of Afghanistan. Just 23 years 
old when he was killed at the attack at 
the Kabul airport, he gave his life de-
fending our citizens and our allies as 
they tried to escape from Afghanistan. 
Right after graduating from Millard 
South High School, Corporal Page 
joined the Marines and was part of the 
2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. He 
enjoyed playing hockey, and was an 
avid sports fan, especially of the Chi-
cago Blackhawks. Corporal Page loved 
spending time outdoors, hunting, and 
being in the water. He was a Boy 
Scout, a good friend to many, and a 
member of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church. 
My prayers are with his parents, 
Wendy and Craig Adelson and Greg and 
Jenni Page, as well as his brothers and 
sister, his grandparents, his girlfriend 
Jessica Ellison, and his other family 
members and many friends. 
We all owe Corporal Page and his fel-
low marines a debt of gratitude. He and 
those he served with rescued countless 
Americans and allies. They went into 
the chaos of the withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan to help strangers that they 
never met—to save lives. There is no 
doubt in my mind that many lives were 
saved because of Corporal Page’s serv-
ice, and his sacrifice will not be forgot-
ten.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 2749. A bill to prohibit the use of 
Federal funds to close or relocate the 
Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San 
Diego, California; to the Committee on 
Armed Services. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the ‘‘Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot San Diego Protec-
tion Act,’’ which I introduced today 
with Senator PADILLA. 
This bill would protect the historic 
Marine Corps recruit training base in 
San Diego and ensure that Marines 
have a world-class training facility on 
the West Coast. 
The base became operational in 1921 
and began its mission of training and 
‘‘the making of Marines’’ in 1923. On 
January 1, 1948, Marine Corps Base, 
San Diego was officially renamed Ma-
rine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego. 
As needed, the base has increased the 
number of new Marine recruits that it 
trains to ensure our readiness during 
periods of conflict. 
For example, the Marine Corps Re-
cruit Depot San Diego augmented 
troop training during the Korean War 
and expanded training during the Viet-
nam War. In recent decades, the base 
has prepared Marines to fight in the 
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The installation’s unique Spanish co-
lonial design by Bertram Goodhue adds 
to its historical richness. Twentyfive of 
the Depot’s original buildings have 
been deemed worthy of preservation for 
their historical significance and are 
part of the National Register of His-
toric Places. 
In May, the San Diego Depot cele-
brated its historic graduation of its

first gender-integrated class of new 
Marines, well in advance of the re-
quirement in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 for 
Marines to conduct integrated gender 
recruit training by 2028. 
Marine Corps Recruit Depot San 
Diego accomplished that mission this 
year, demonstrating the can-do spirit 
that has animated the base since its es-
tablishment. 
Our bill would prohibit the closure of 
the historic Marine Corps Recruit 
Depot located in San Diego. It would 
protect regional jobs and tourist rev-
enue generated by the installation. 
The bill would also eliminate the 
need for costly new military construc-
tion if the training mission were relo-
cated, and prevent the disruption of 
families and training. 
Lastly, the bill would guarantee the 
annual basic training for Marine re-
cruits at the place where their fellow 
Marines have trained for a century. On 
the 100th anniversary of the installa-
tion, we must continue this critical 
mission in San Diego and preserve its 
history. 
It is imperative to maintain facilities 
that train and prepare our Armed 
Forces to meet the challenges of to-
morrow. The protection of the Depot 
preserves an important legacy of the 
Marine Corps. The installation also of-
fers a strategic location to position 
forces in the West. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you Mr. 
President. I yield the floor. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. PAUL, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. COL-
LINS, and Mr. COONS): 
S. 2753. A bill to amend the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act to authorize 
lawful permanent resident status for 
certain college graduates who entered 
the United States as children, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. President, I rise to introduce the 
‘‘America’s Children Act of 2021.’’ 
This legislation would ensure that 
dependents of immigrants in the green 
card backlog do not age out of their 
legal immigration status when they 
turn 21 and provides a pathway to per-
manency for these children and young 
adults. 
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO 
This legislation would provide a 
pathway to permanent residency for 
dependents of nonimmigrant visa hold-
ers if they have been a dependent for at 
least 4 years, have lived in the United 
States for 10 years and have graduated 
from an institution of higher education 
in the United States. 
The bill fills an important gap in our 
legal immigration system, since many 
immigrants and their families often 
have to wait decades to receive a green 
card due to numerical limitations and 
per country caps. The children who age 
out of dependent status have few op-
tions to stay in the United States once 
they turn 21 and even fewer paths to 
permanency even though many have 
only known the United States as their 
home. It is unjust that these children 
and young people are at risk of depor-
tation to their birth countries simply 
because our legal immigration system 
is outdated. 
WHY THE BILL IS NEEDED 
There are an estimated 255,000 chil-
dren who are or were the dependents of 
parents with lawful work visas, cur-
rently awaiting their green card proc-
essing in the immigration backlog. All 
of these individuals are at risk of de-
portation at age 21 if their applications 
are not processed in time, or have al-
ready aged out of status. 
This bill is a commonsense measure 
that ensures that children who have 
grown up in our communities and wish 
to go to a university and work in the 
United States have the opportunity to 
do so. Most of these individuals do not 
have close ties in their birth countries 
and removing them from the United 
States would mean separation from 
their families and the life they have al-
ways known. 
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
365—HON-
ORING THE LIFE, LEGACY, AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF 
MACNOLIA 
COX 
Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. 
PORTMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
Whereas MacNolia Cox (Montiere) was 
born on January 12, 1923, in Kenmore, Ohio, 
to her parents John Thomas Cox and Alberta 
(Evans) Key, and raised in Akron, Ohio; 
Whereas MacNolia was a member of Liv-
ingston Baptist Church and, as a child, en-
joyed reading the dictionary from A to Z to 
learn the definitions and spellings of words; 
Whereas, in 1936, at the age of 13, MacNolia 
won the Akron Spelling Bee at the Akron 
Armory over the course of 2.5 hours, besting 
50 other participants and becoming the first 
Black participant to win the competition; 
Whereas MacNolia won the Akron Spelling 
Bee with the word ‘‘voluble’’ in front of 3,000 
people, taking home a $25 prize and a ticket 
to Washington, D.C., to compete in the 
Scripps National Spelling Bee; 
Whereas, upon arriving in Washington, 
D.C., MacNolia was forced to stay in a seg-
regated hotel and was not permitted sit with 
the other participants during the competi-
tion; 
Whereas, 
during 
the 
competition, 
MacNolia was asked to spell the word ‘‘nem-
esis’’, which at the time was capitalized and 
therefore barred from the competition; 
Whereas the use of this word in the com-
petition was immediately protested by a 
Beacon Journal reporter, and despite learn-
ing 100,000 approved words, MacNolia mis-
spelled the word and finished the competi-
tion fifth overall, taking home a $75 prize; 
Whereas, 
upon 
her 
return 
to 
Akron, 
MacNolia was greeted by a parade of hun-
dreds of cars of community members, where 
local dignitaries made speeches on behalf of 
her success; 
Whereas MacNolia went on to work as a 
domestic employee for a local doctor; and 
Whereas MacNolia Cox Montiere died of 
cancer on September 12, 1976, at the age of 53, 
and was survived by her husband John, step-
son Nelson Montiere, stepdaughter Joan 
Montiere Tabler, brother Otis Cox, sisters 
Orabell Finney, Rosa Lee Jackson, and Ollie 
Davis, and 1 granddaughter: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate honors the life, 
legacy, and achievements of MacNolia Cox, 
an inspiration for young students of color 
today.

PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF 
SEPTEMBER 11 THROUGH SEP-
TEMBER 17 AS ‘‘PATRIOT WEEK’’ 
Mr. PETERS (for himself and Mr. 
KENNEDY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 366 
Whereas the events that led to the signing 
of the Constitution of the United States by 
the delegates to the Constitutional Conven-
tion on September 17, 1787, have significance 
for every citizen of the United States and are 
honored in public schools across the United 
States on Constitution Day, which is Sep-
tember 17 of each year; 
Whereas the rule of law, the social com-
pact, 
democracy, 
liberty, 
equality, 
and 
unalienable human rights are the essential 
values upon which the United States flour-
ishes; 
Whereas diversity is one of the greatest 
strengths of the United States, and the 
motto inscribed on the Great Seal of the 
United States, ‘‘E pluribus unum’’, Latin for 
‘‘out of many, one’’, symbolizes that individ-
uals in the United States from all walks of 
life are unified by shared values; 
Whereas exceptional, visionary, and indis-
pensable individuals such as Thomas Paine, 
Patrick Henry, John Adams, John Marshall, 
George Washington, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tub-
man, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Jefferson, 
and James Madison founded or advanced the 
United States; 
Whereas the Declaration of Independence, 
the Constitution of the United States, the 
Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions 
signed in Seneca Falls, New York, the Get-
tysburg Address, the Emancipation Procla-
mation, and the ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech de-
livered by Martin Luther King, Jr., express 
sentiments that have advanced liberty in the 
United States; and 
Whereas the Bennington flag (commonly 
known as the ‘‘’76 flag’’), the Betsy Ross flag, 
the current flag of the United States, the 
flag of the women’s suffrage movement, the 
Union flag (commonly known as the ‘‘Fort 
Sumter flag’’), the Gadsden flag, and the 
flags of the States are physical symbols of 
the history of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
September 11 through September 17 as ‘‘Pa-
triot Week’’; 
(2) recognizes that understanding the his-
tory of the United States and the first prin-
ciples of the United States is indispensable 
to the survival of the United States as a free 
people; 
(3) acknowledges, in great reverence to the 
victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, 
that citizens of the United States should 
take time to honor the first principles, 
founders, documents, and symbols of their 
history;

the following concurrent resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. CON. RES. 15 
Whereas the United States was viciously 
attacked by the murderous terrorist group 
al-Qaida on September 11, 2001; 
Whereas al-Qaida was based in Afghani-
stan, which was governed by the ruthless and 
oppressive Taliban regime; 
Whereas the United States led an inter-
national coalition of military forces into Af-
ghanistan— 
(1) to destroy al-Qaida; 
(2) to kill or capture Osama bin Laden; and 
(3) to depose the Taliban government; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of members 
of the Armed Forces, diplomats, and humani-
tarians deployed to Afghanistan or supported 
operations from afar; 
Whereas for nearly 2 decades, the United 
States was spared from further major at-
tacks by international terror organizations; 
and 
Whereas the withdrawal of the presence of 
the United States in Afghanistan led to— 
(1) the collapse of the Afghan government; 
(2) the return of the Taliban to Afghan 
rule; and 
(3) great heartache for so many: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) the men and women who undertook the 
efforts of the past years in Afghanistan pro-
vided heroic service to the country; 
(2) the peace the United States experienced 
is a direct result of the actions of the brave 
members of the Armed Forces, diplomats, 
and humanitarians; 
(3) despite the chaotic end to operations in 
Afghanistan, the service of the members of 
the Armed Forces is something to be remem-
bered, lauded, and honored; and 
(4) any veterans who feel stress, anger, or 
disappointment from the end of operations in 
Afghanistan should seek available resources 
and the comfort, guidance, and counsel of 
friends, mentors, and caregivers.

HONORING CORPORAL DAEGAN

Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, words

watching the ruthless Taliban once 
again seize control of Afghanistan, the 
very same country from where terror-
ists plotted the attacks on America 
two decades earlier.

September 15, 2021 
desperately attempted to escape the 
terror and bleak future certain to re-
turn under the rule of the Taliban. 
Through the chaos and the panic, the 
brave men and women of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, who once freed the Na-
tion from the terrorist regime, stood as 
protectors at the Kabul airport for 
those who were desperately seeking a 
way out. 
Then, on August 26, a terrorist at-
tack at the airport claimed the lives of 
13 of these brave servicemembers who 
were assisting with the evacuation, 
marking one of the deadliest days for 
U.S. forces during the 20-year conflict. 
Marine Corporal Daegan William- 
Tyeler Page was one of those killed in 
action on that day. Daegan was a 
young man from Red Oak, IA, who 
truly represents the greatness of our 
State, our country, and the U.S. Ma-
rine Corps in which he proudly served. 
Daegan may have been just 23 years 
old, but he died a hero who lived a life 
of service to his community and to his 
Nation. 
Our hearts go out to those to whom 
he meant the most: his girlfriend, Jes-
sica; his parents, Wendy and Craig 
Adelson and Greg and Jenni Page; his 
grandparents; and his four siblings, 
Corey, Garrett, Mason, and Emerson, 
to whom Daegan has always been a 
hero, even before he became a U.S. ma-
rine. 
The wounds of war obviously aren’t 
just borne by the warrior. It is the fam-
ily of the fallen who will carry the 
scars for a lifetime. The hole left in 
their lives by the loss of Daegan can 
never, ever be filled. So let’s also keep 
Daegan’s family in our prayers. 
Being from Red Oak, IA, I know 
Daegan’s family. I have grown up with 
Daegan’s family. It was my best friend 
in Red Oak that texted me after that 
explosion at the Kabul airport. She is 
the one who told me that Wendy Tye’s 
son Daegan had been killed in this ex-
plosion. 
So I gave the family time to come to-
gether, and that next morning I called 
Wendy’s mother, Peggy. I love Peggy 
very much. I love their entire family 
very much, and I told her I was so 
sorry about the loss of Daegan. And she 
told me: JONI, just please let everybody 
know what an amazing young man that 
Daegan was. 
And he was an extraordinary young 
man. Before we ended our conversa-
tion, she said: JONI, give that precious 
Libby of yours a hug for me, like I used 
to so many years ago when she was a 
little girl. 
And she said: You never know when 
you will get that last hug from some-
one you love. 
And, Peggy, I did. I gave my daugh-
ter Libby a hug. 
So while Daegan was a tough ma-
rine—he really was—again, an amazing 
young man. He was fun, loving, and he 
had a giant heart and a soft spot for 
animals. He had three dogs—Shyia, 
Gracie, and Finn. 
Growing up in Red Oak, and then in 
Omaha, Daegan’s commitment to serv-
ice began at a young age as a longtime 
member of the Boy Scouts. 
While he was just a child when the 
terrorists attacked America on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, after graduating from 
Millard South High School, he an-
swered the call to serve his country by 
joining the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Daegan’s family says that he loved 
the brotherhood of the Marines and 
was proud to serve as a member of the 
2d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment at 
Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, 
CA. 
Daegan was always a dedicated team 
member. It didn’t matter what it was, 
but he was dedicated, according to his 
former hockey teammates who, to-
gether, won the Nebraska State cham-
pionship tournament. Omaha’s hockey 
community has fittingly paid tribute 
to Daegan by placing hockey sticks on 
their porches in his memory. 
A memorial service to celebrate 
Daegan’s life is being held this Friday 
at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in 
Omaha. 
Like his family, teammates, and fel-
low servicemembers, we mourn the loss 
of Daegan, but also honor his heroism 
and his valor. He has been awarded the 
Purple Heart for making that ultimate 
sacrifice in the line of duty. 
His life in Red Oak, IA, and Omaha, 
NE, and his death, remind us that this 
world is a very dangerous place with 
many wishing to do the United States 
harm. Our protection here at home de-
pends upon the sacrifice and the serv-
ice of many heroes, those like Daegan. 
Let it not be forgotten that thou-
sands of other lives were rescued from 
pending doom because of the bravery of 
Daegan and the 12 other servicemem-
bers who lost their lives that day while 
standing guard to ensure the safe pas-
sage of others out of Afghanistan. 
While it is heartbreaking that he was 
taken from this world too soon, Daegan 
will forever have the gratitude of our 
Nation. 
So Wendy and Greg, and to your fam-
ilies, please accept my heartfelt condo-
lences on the loss of your beautiful son, 
Daegan. The American people will 
never forget him, nor will they ever 
forget his life of service. 
Semper Fidelis, Daegan, and god-
speed. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING LANCE CORPORAL 
DAVID LEE ESPINOZA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the 
final days of the U.S. military’s pres-
ence in Afghanistan, our country suf-
fered 
a 
devastating 
loss. 
Thirteen 
servicemembers were killed in a ter-
rorist attack at the airport in Kabul, 
marking the deadliest day for the U.S. 
military in more than a decade in that 
country. 
These young men and women, all be-
tween the ages of 20 and 31, were taken 
from loving families—parents, siblings, 
spouses, fiance´es—even a baby on the 
way. 
In Laredo, TX, on Monday, I had the 
solemn honor of attending the funeral 
for one of these heroes and offering my 
condolences to his family. 
U.S. Marine Corps LCpl David Lee 
Espinoza was only 20 years old when he 
lost his life last month, but he rep-
resented the very best of the Marine 
Corps, the U.S. military, and the very 
best of America. 
From childhood, he dreamed of serv-
ing in the military. He joined the Ma-
rines right after high school to serve 
his country and to protect our freedom. 
And last month, he made the ultimate 
sacrifice in service to that mission. 
The pride in this young marine and 
the gratitude for his service and sac-
rifice was visible throughout the La-
redo community. Driving through La-
redo from the airport, the streets were 
lined with folks, including school-
children holding up American flags in 
honor of LCpl Espinoza. Veterans from 
across the State proudly stood outside 
the entrance to St. Patrick Catholic 
Church to pay tribute to their fallen 
brother. And across the street, a giant 
American flag hung from the ladder of 
two fire trucks. 
I attended the mass, officiated by 
Bishop James Tamayo, and paid my re-
spects to David Espinoza’s family and 
other members of his family. 
There is nothing we can do to bring 
back LCpl Espinoza, but we can ensure 
that his service and sacrifice, and that 
of the other servicemembers killed 
that day, will never be forgotten. 
I join those across the country who 
are mourning the loss of their heroes 
and honoring the sacrifices they have 
made for our freedoms. To me, one of 
the most unique things about the U.S. 
military—this is not just about our 
freedom. They were protecting the 
rights and the freedom and the dignity 
of people on the other side of the plan-
et. Our Nation is forever grateful to 
these young men and women and their 
loved ones who made unfathomable 
sacrifices for our freedoms. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are 
back in session after a busy August, 
and we are hitting the ground running 
in the U.S. Senate. 
This week, congressional committees 
have heard from top Biden administra-
tion officials about the disastrous 
withdrawal of our troops from Afghani-
stan. In the months to come, there will 
be more questions about the decisions 
that led to the collapse of that country 
and how the administration plans to 
protect the American people from ter-
rorist threats moving forward. 
You know, the whole premise of our 
going to Afghanistan in the first place 
was to deny vacuums that could be 
filled by terrorist organizations like 
al-Qaida and ISIS and thus represent a 
threat to the homeland not only of peo-
ple in Europe and in the region but also

to the people here in the United States. 
Some called 9/11/2001 a failure of imagi-
nation because we never imagined that 
terrorists overseas would plan and exe-
cute a terrorist attack that would kill 
3,000 Americans using 2 airplanes to fly 
into the World Trade Center. 
So now, with the embarrassing and 
disastrous withdrawal by the Biden ad-
ministration of our troops from Af-
ghanistan, the question is, How long 
will it take the terrorists to reconsti-
tute themselves and present a clear 
and present danger to not only the re-
gion but also the continent of Europe 
and the United States? But for right 
now, we deserve and the American peo-
ple deserve answers and accountability. 
And it is not just these 13 marines who 
lost their lives in Afghanistan; other 
American servicemembers have lost 
their lives and literally their limbs to 
try to deny a safe haven to terrorist or-
ganizations like al-Qaida and ISIS. 
I worry that they may worry that 
their sacrifices may have been in vain 
if, in fact, these terrorists occupy this 
vacuum which has now been created 
with a very hospitable Taliban, which 
was responsible for hosting al-Qaida in 
the first place. I worry that these 
troops feel like their sacrifice has been 
in vain. But I want to assure them that 
they did what they were asked to do by 
their Commander in Chief with honor 
and respect and great personal sac-
rifice. And no matter what happens 
going 
forward, 
nothing 
will 
ever 
change the respect and the honor that 
we have for them and their service. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we also 
have a fast-approaching government 
funding deadline. To be specific, we 
have about 16 days before we will be 
knee deep in a government shutdown 
unless Congress appropriates money to 
keep the lights on. Following a year 
and a half of economic instability, 
there is no justification to unleash 
even more uncertainty on our economy 
and on hard-working American fami-
lies. Then, on top of that, we are told 
that our Democratic colleagues intend 
to pass a $31⁄2 trillion—probably closer 
to $5 trillion—reckless tax-and-spend-
ing-spree bill, otherwise known as rec-
onciliation. 
You know, during the last year, dur-
ing the COVID–19 crisis, we worked 
very well together because we knew 
this was a national emergency that did 
not respect political parties or ide-
ology or persons, and we had to do ev-
erything we could on an emergency 
basis to help. But that emergency is 
quickly getting in our rearview mirror, 
and our Democratic colleagues seem to 
be determined to continue to reck-
lessly spend borrowed money that will 
have to be repaid by the next genera-
tion of Americans and to raise taxes to 
the highest level in recent memory, 
thus compounding the risk not only of 
inflation, which is a regressive tax on 
working families when the food they 
put on the table, the gasoline they buy, 
and the appliances they buy all are see-
ing prices going up at very quickly es-
calating levels. There is a real danger 
that this sort of reckless tax-and- 
spending spree will have a very nega-
tive effect not only on them but also 
on our economy more generally. 
For months, we know our Demo-
cratic colleagues have been debating 
back and forth about how much they 
are willing to spend on a liberal wish 
list. The chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee initially floated a staggering 
figure of $6 trillion. 
Now, I never dreamed that in my life-
time—certainly in my service here in 
the U.S. Senate—I would ever vote for 
a trillion-dollar bill, but I did during 
the emergency called COVID–19 be-
cause I thought it was necessary. But 
this kind of reckless spending is not 
necessary. This is an ideological jug-
gernaut to try to achieve things to 
transform this country into some west-
ern European social democracy—social 
welfare state. 
Well, after months of negotiating 
amongst themselves, our Democratic 
colleagues have now settled not on a $6 
trillion figure but on $31⁄2 trillion. It is 
still a shocking number. Nonpartisan 
budget experts, as I indicated, said the 
actual cost would end up closer to $51⁄2 
trillion, so don’t be fooled by this so- 
called 
appearance 
of 
self-restraint. 
This plan is chock full of damaging tax 
hikes, permanent welfare with no work 
requirements, Green New Deal climate 
mandates, and a laundry list of social-
ist policies. 
A party-line vote just before the re-
cess laid the groundwork for the big-
gest government spending bonanza in 
American history, but now some of our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
are 
experi-
encing a little buyer’s remorse, perhaps 
given the rapidly approaching date for 
the 2022 elections, and they are ex-
pressing some remorse or hesitation 
before swiping the taxpayers’ credit 
card once more. 
Senators MANCHIN and SINEMA have 
both voiced their opposition to the ex-
treme $31⁄2 trillion figure. Earlier this 
month, Senator MANCHIN wrote an op- 
ed explaining why he won’t support 
such irresponsible spending. Our col-
leagues ought to read it and to con-
sider his arguments. He said Demo-
cratic leaders in Congress have pro-
posed 
passing 
‘‘the 
largest 
single 
spending bill in history with no regard 
to rising inflation, crippling debt, or 
the inevitability of future crises.’’ 
The fractures in the reckless tax-and- 
spending spree aren’t just deepening in 
the Senate; House Democrats are be-
ginning to wring their hands, trying to 
figure out if they can justify such ex-
treme spending and taxing. And I must 
say it certainly will require some cre-
ative thinking. 
Trillions more in borrowing when 
American families are already being 
pummeled by inflation; a sweeping am-
nesty with no effort to control the 
growing immigration crisis at the 
southern border; tax hikes on Amer-
ican families and small businesses—our 
Democratic colleagues are proposing 
the most extreme policy proposals that 
one might imagine in this one massive 
bill. So getting their Members on board 
is half the battle, but we are now see-
ing the internal debates and discus-
sions among Democrats wondering if 
this is the wisest course of conduct, be-
cause there is no doubt about it—this 
is a massive amount of money, and 
Democrats are going to have to raise 
the debt ceiling by themselves if they 
want to write a check that big. 
This is where things get a little 
kooky. Even though this is a partisan 
spending spree, our friends across the 
aisle expect Republicans to join them 
in raising the debt ceiling, claiming 
that this should be a bipartisan effort. 
But it is clear Democrats don’t require 
Republican support. They can attach 
this credit increase to the tax-and- 
spending-spree bill and pass it with 
only Democratic support. The only 
problem is, they don’t really want to 
own it. They want political cover. They 
want us to help them pull the pin out 
of the economic grenade that they are 
about to toss in the laps of the Amer-
ican people. When this reckless tax- 
and-spending spree inevitably blows up, 
they want to be able to blame someone 
else. They want plausible deniability. 
But it is not going to work that way. 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader, and folks on our side of the 
aisle have made it crystal clear on that 
point for months. If they want to spend 
alone, they are going to have to ad-
dress the debt ceiling alone. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues can’t cut Republicans 
out of the process when it is conven-
ient and then beg cooperation when 
they need someone else to blame. 
I have no doubt that our colleagues 
across the aisle will come up with a 
host of gimmicks to try to get Repub-
licans on board. Some have suggested 
threatening to shut down the govern-
ment or withholding critical disaster 
relief. To be absolutely clear, folks on 
our side of the aisle do not want a gov-
ernment shutdown. The American peo-
ple and our economy are already expe-
riencing enough pain. In my State of 
Texas, we suffered enough natural dis-
asters for me to understand how crit-
ical it is to get disaster relief out the 
door as quickly as possible. Commu-
nities impacted by hurricanes and 
wildfires do not deserve to be treated 
as political pawns on a chessboard. 
If Democrats want to charge $51⁄2 tril-
lion to the taxpayers’ credit card, they 
will have to increase the credit limit 
themselves, and they can do it by 
themselves with the $31⁄2 trillion social 
welfare bill, and they can’t treat dis-
aster victims and government funding 
as hostages. 
Our Democratic colleagues already 
went on one partisan spending spree 
earlier this year—an additional $1.9 
trillion under the guise of providing 
COVID relief, when only about 10 per-
cent of it actually addressed COVID.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6531 
September 15, 2021 
That has fueled, in the opinion of peo-
ple like former Democratic economists, 
office holders—Larry Summers, for ex-
ample, who said that we are risking a 
growth of inflation, which will raise 
prices on commodities and things that 
people need in their daily lives in order 
to live and thus form an invisible tax. 
As it stands today, our debt is rough-
ly 107 percent of our gross domestic 
product—$28.7 trillion and counting. 
Most of us can’t imagine what a tril-
lion dollars is, much less a billion dol-
lars, but it is roughly $28.7 trillion. And 
the sad news is, somebody is going to 
have to pay that back—somebody. I be-
lieve it is simply immoral for us to 
continue 
spending, 
borrow 
money, 
raise the debt, and expect future gen-
erations to pick up the tab. We know, 
at the same time, families are being 
hammered by inflation, as I said, and 
small businesses are still trying to lure 
employees back to work. 
So we are not going to assist with an 
encore performance of the partisan 
spending spree that we saw earlier this 
year. If our Democratic colleagues be-
lieve this partisan tax-and-spending 
spree is a wise investment for the 
American people, they are going to 
have to sell it to the American people 
and up the credit limit on their own. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, bor-
der security is one of the government’s 
most important responsibilities. A sov-
ereign, successful Nation’s self-deter-
mination and safety depend upon it, 
and we are no exception. 
Our border security rests exclusively 
with the Federal Government. And the 
Department of Homeland Security—a 
Cabinet created in 2002, I believe, in the 
aftermath of the September 11 attack— 
is entrusted with this paramount duty 
of protecting our border. 
Fusing homeland with security for 
its name wasn’t an accident. That 
wordage casts the Department’s pur-
pose to protect the country from exter-
nal threats, both from people and from 
products. And Americans pay for that 
Department handsomely and for its re-
sponsibilities about $52 billion a year. 
However, a grave, unprecedented cri-
sis exists at our southern border. Our 
television reminds us of that fact daily. 
Foreign nationals are illegally crossing 
into our country from Mexico by the 
thousands every day. I heard recently 
that last month was the biggest num-
ber coming in for over 20 years. But il-
legal immigration isn’t the only crime 
cascading over our borders. 
Mexican cartels are importing deadly 
drugs and trafficking humans. These 
horrific, unabated events make very 
clear that the cartels effectively con-
trol our southern border. They actually 
manage who and what enters our coun-
try from Mexico. 
But the danger is preventable. The 
trouble exists because the current ad-
ministration deliberately refuses to se-
cure the border. 
Homeland Security’s border derelic-
tion is inexcusable, and it happens to 
be life-threatening, not only from 
drugs but from criminals and for na-
tional security because terrorists have 
been arrested. 
Communities across all States, then, 
are plagued by the crime and the drugs 
killing Americans by the tens of thou-
sands every year. The figure from 2020 
is over 93,000 Americans dying from 
drug overdoses—a 31-percent increase 
from just the previous year. That ex-
ceeds the Rose Bowl’s capacity, as just 
one example of comparison. 
One drug is very prolific: Mexican 
fentanyl, probably fentanyl coming 
through Mexico from China. Fentanyl 
is a synthetic opioid. It is 50 times 
more potent than heroin. An infinites-
imal amount, even as small as a grain 
of salt, can cause a death. The cartels 
are producing the deadly drug and 
smuggling it into the United States at 
record highs. They are also adding 
fentanyl to other drugs for increased 
potency and, of course, increased prof-
its—often without the user of that drug 
even knowing that fact—and some-
times even market that fentanyl-laced 
drug into heroin. 
Unsurprisingly, then, deaths result. 
From January 2019 to June of 2019, al-
most 62 percent of the overdose deaths 
involved a fentanyl-related substance. 
The authority scheduling fentanyl 
analogs expire next month. Congress 
must act to permanently schedule 
these drugs and punish the cartels and 
the drug dealers who spread this poison 
across our communities. 
We are a nation of compassion, but 
we are also a nation of laws. We are not 
obligated under any charade of compas-
sion to ignore border crime, particu-
larly the surge of deadly drugs killing 
tens of thousands here each year. But 
the government, as we see, sits idly by 
as cartel drugs poison Americans and 
unleash drug-related violence upon our 
communities. 
Border security is essential in keep-
ing our public safety threats and a car-
tel-controlled 
border 
presents 
our 
greatest criminal threat. 
The Federal Government must be a 
staunch ally to the States in stopping 
the crime. The cartels benefit im-
mensely from an unsecured border, and 
they are not exactly screening for 
threats to our national security and 
public safety. 
We have reached a critical juncture 
and must choose who actually controls 
the 
southern 
border, 
and, 
con-
sequently, our self-determination and 
our safety. Violent drug cartels or 
home security—which is it? The choice 
directs our future. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
another matter, today, I speak to my 
fellow colleagues on the extraordinary 
courage, bravery, and patriotism that 
the men and women in our Armed 
Forces showed to the entire world, yet 
again, in the last several months in Af-
ghanistan. 
Now, we see plenty of evidence that 
they were placed in an impossible situ-
ation because of the bad judgment and 
leadership failures of President Biden. 
Despite President Biden’s bad judg-
ment, our men and women in uniform 
again exceeded expectations. In the 
process of doing their job for people 
whom they don’t even know, we lost 13 
of our best who gave the ultimate sac-
rifice for their country, and 18 more 
suffered serious injuries. 
I pray—and I assume all Americans 
pray—for their families for the loss 
that those families have suffered. 
Those 13 young men and women will 
never, and should never, be forgotten. 
They are heroes. 
This disastrous exit was entirely 
avoidable, which makes the loss of life 
even more gut-wrenching. 
Intelligent and honest people can dis-
agree on whether the Americans should 
have left Afghanistan, but it is un-
thinkable that anyone could justify the 
manner in which this administration 
carried out this disaster. 
The Biden administration left Ameri-
cans behind. This is the United States 
of America. We never leave our people 
behind. I have heard from many Iowans 
who are outraged by this moral failure. 
When he took office, President Biden 
arrogantly announced that ‘‘America is 
back.’’ Now the world is seeing Amer-
ica in retreat. The Russians and Red 
China are crowing over this comedy. 
I and others have compared the im-
agery and the perception to the fall of 
Saigon. But, remember, in that case, 
we had pulled our military out before 
we broke our promises to the South Vi-
etnamese military. 
In this case, it appears that crucial 
support for the Afghan military was 
withdrawn while we were relying on 
that same military to hold off the 
Taliban long enough to complete our 
withdrawal. 
I have been at many briefings related 
to President Biden’s Afghan exit. I 
have tasked my oversight and policy 
staff to do the same. Some have been 
classified briefings; others were not 
classified. What I can say—and what I 
believe the American people ought to 
know—is 
that 
this 
administration 
couldn’t track the state of play on the 
ground in the way that they should 
have had the capability to do. 
Every briefing gave a more dire and 
desperate picture than the one briefing 
we received before. It was obvious that 
this administration was losing control. 
Yet it was clear to me and my col-
leagues that the administration never 
sufficiently changed its posture in the 
region as the facts on the ground 
changed from bad to worse. 
When the administration officials 
were questioned about this strategy, 
they often publicly responded that 
what they were doing was based on 
Presidential-level decisions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6532 
September 15, 2021 
Joe Biden owns this disastrous exit, 
plain and simple. But, also, Secretary 
Austin, Secretary Blinken, and General 
Milley are not without blame. 
The exit has realized the worst fears 
of every Afghan who, over 20 years, 
learned to dream of peace, and every 
naysayer who said: Wait, and they will 
leave. Our enemies were right, and now 
we have left. 
The Biden administration certainly 
left the women of Afghanistan behind. 
They are once again being beaten, 
killed in the streets for supposed 
crimes, such as daring to speak, want-
ing an education, not covering their 
faces, and, in some cases, simply walk-
ing in public. 
The Biden administration, in its 
hasty 
exit, 
effectively 
armed 
the 
Taliban with advanced American mili-
tary weaponry that is now being used 
to oppress the Afghan people. The 
Taliban is now patrolling our streets in 
Kabul in American vehicles, wearing 
American 
uniforms, 
and 
carrying 
American-made weapons. 
Some of the violent terrorists re-
leased by the Obama administration 
are now in political leadership roles in 
this Taliban regime. Other members of 
the Taliban leadership have remained 
on the FBI’s most wanted list, and they 
have been on that list for many years, 
including one with a $10 million boun-
ty. Now, if this were a movie script, no-
body would believe it. 
In addition to the equipment and the 
funds, it is crucial that we remember 
the human cost in Afghanistan. We lost 
2,461 servicemembers, 18 of whom came 
from my State of Iowa. We also lost 
3,846 contractors, 66,000 American mili-
tary and police, 1,144 allied service-
members, 444 aid workers, and 72 jour-
nalists. These numbers hit home. They 
hit deep. And we should never forget 
them. 
These numbers also don’t account for 
the stain on our national reputation 
for blatantly disregarding the welfare 
of the Afghan people who fought along-
side us to help us accomplish our mis-
sion there. Leaving behind allies will 
have consequences that will affect our 
ability to build coalitions in the fu-
ture. It will negatively impact our abil-
ity to defeat future enemies. 
Looking through the negatives, the 
heartache and the pain that our coun-
try has suffered from this terribly exe-
cuted exit, I remain hopeful. Where the 
Biden administration has failed, we 
have seen veterans and current mem-
bers of our armed services filling the 
leadership gap. Where our government 
didn’t keep its promise by working to-
gether, these veterans and current 
members of our armed services and the 
groups associated with them quickly 
built ad hoc networks to ensure their 
Afghan brothers-in-arms and their fam-
ilies were able to leave their crumbling 
country safely. 
Americans have been inspired by re-
ports of Operation Pineapple Express, 
organized by special operations vet-
erans who, without even being asked or 
without even asking for permission, 
helped hundreds of Afghan allies and 
their families to safety. 
One of the more inspiring stories 
from this disastrous exit involved an 
Afghan family being guided by his 
former U.S. marine brother to Abbey 
Gate at the Kabul airport. The Afghan 
family was instructed by the U.S. Ma-
rine veterans to carry signs with them 
that invoked Marine Corps phrases 
that our marines at Abbey Gate would 
understand but the Taliban would not 
understand. 
After several attempts, the marines 
on the wall saw the signs and were able 
to retrieve the family and escort them 
through Abbey Gate only moments be-
fore the suicide attack that took the 
lives of 11 marines, a Navy corpsman, a 
U.S. soldier, and scores and scores of 
Afghan civilians. 
When the Marine Corps veteran net-
work was eventually able to make con-
tact with the interpreter, he was asked 
if he and his family were all right. His 
reply was, ‘‘Of course I’m good. I’m 
with marines.’’ 
Now, that is just one story, but this 
isn’t the only amazing story regarding 
our veterans and our servicemembers. 
Pictures that were taken during this 
time show the desperation of the Af-
ghan 
people: 
mothers 
desperately 
throwing their children to American 
troops in the hope that even if the par-
ents couldn’t reach safety, their chil-
dren could. These pictures also show 
the pure hearts of these American war-
riors whom we honor. 
During this 20-year conflict, our serv-
ice men and women have never wavered 
in their duty to God and country, con-
sistently showing their ability to anni-
hilate the enemy. They defeated the 
Taliban, liberated the people of Af-
ghanistan, and protected our country 
from further terrorist attacks for 20 
years. 
During their final hours in Kabul, our 
young warriors did something unimagi-
nable for almost any other country’s 
military: They injected humanity into 
the dark fringes of a war-torn conflict 
during a mass evacuation. We have 
seen the pictures of marines in full bat-
tle attire holding crying infants. We 
have seen our servicemembers giving 
the shirts off their backs to keep chil-
dren warm. This stands in contrast to 
the actions of political leaders thou-
sands of miles away here, where we 
stand this very day. 
Despite the Taliban’s most recent 
acts of barbarism, the Biden adminis-
tration has begun discussing potential 
recognition of the Taliban as a govern-
ment. The possibility of taxpayer-fund-
ed foreign aid has been dangled as a 
carrot to incentivize their good behav-
ior. This is pure naivete on the part of 
anybody in this administration think-
ing about that. 
The Biden administration’s string of 
foreign policy blunders has created a 
domino effect that Americans will feel 
for years to come. Afghanistan could 
once again become the epicenter for 
terrorist activities that will launch fu-
ture attacks on our Nation—hopefully 
not another 9/11. I pray that my con-
cerns will not become reality, but 
somehow I have to have fear that they 
will be reality. At the very least, 
Americans’ credibility on the world 
stage with our allies, even with our en-
emies, has taken a huge hit. 
In the unfortunate event that our 
worst fears come to light, my solace is 
in the knowledge that our service men 
and women continue to have the 
strength to overcome the failures of 
our own political leaders. 
So, to my fellow Americans, let us 
never forget the sacrifices of our men 
and women in the armed services and 
the sacrifices that that means for pro-
tecting our freedom and security. Their 
service and sacrifice have been of im-
measurable value. All Americans owe a 
debt to them that can never fully be re-
paid.
