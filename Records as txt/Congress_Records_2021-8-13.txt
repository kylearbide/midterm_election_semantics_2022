CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
JANICE MIRIKITANI 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
along with Bay Area Representatives BARBARA 
LEE and JACKIE SPEIER, to pay tribute to the 
late Janice Mirikitani: a gifted poet and a bea-
con of resilience for so many in America. Jan-
ice was a force for social justice, who over-
came great adversity to empower and inspire 
so many in the Bay Area and beyond through 
her beautiful art and her leadership of the 
Glide Foundation. Her passing is a great loss 
to San Francisco and to our nation. 
Janice’s poetry turned personal pain into 
purpose. Indeed, she experienced a childhood 
marked by hardship: undergoing the national 
shame of internment as a young girl and then 
years of trauma as a young woman. Janice 
faced these challenges directly in her intimate 
and powerful poems. Her extraordinary cour-
age and tenacity shine through in her writings 
on the horrors of war, the scourge of sexual 
abuse and the stain of institutional racism, 
moving and inspiring all who read them. And 
as co-founder and editor of the first Asian 
American literary magazine, Aion, she lifted up 
more voices like hers: women, people of color 
and underserved communities, who have too 
often been silenced. 
Janice was deeply committed to her faith 
and to our Bay Area community. Alongside 
her beloved husband Reverend Cecil Williams, 
who was her partner not only in marriage but 
in service, she helped launch and lead the 
Glide Foundation. This faith-based social jus-
tice mission helped transform the lives of 
countless families in need, by providing essen-
tial health, nutrition and housing services. That 
the Foundation today, decades after its found-
ing, 
embodies 
more strongly than ever 
Janice’s powerful vision of ‘‘a radically inclu-
sive, just and loving community’’ is a testa-
ment to her enduring legacy. 
In a note sent to the Glide community an-
nouncing her passing, the Foundation’s Presi-
dent and CEO wrote: ‘‘She spoke her truth 
and inspired others to accept and celebrate 
themselves, each other, and all our dif-
ferences.’’ Indeed, Janice’s leadership re-
flected the best of San Francisco: the vibrancy 
of our city, the pride in our diversity and the 
strength of our community. 
Janice Mirikitani was a proud Californian: 
born in Stockton, educated at the University of 
California, Los Angeles and San Francisco 
State University, working in San Francisco’s 
Tenderloin neighborhood for many years and 
calling the Bay Area home for nearly her en-
tire life. 
For her creativity and brilliance, Janice re-
ceived the San Francisco Chamber of Com-
merce Lifetime Achievement Ebbie Award, an 
American Book Lifetime Achievement Award 
for Literature, and a Governor and First Lady’s 
Conference on Women and Families Minerva 
Award. She also earned the privilege of serv-
ing as the second poet laureate of San Fran-
cisco. 
May it be a comfort to her dear husband 
Cecil, her loving daughter Tianne and all their 
loved ones that so many San Franciscans— 
and Americans across the nation—join them in 
prayer during this sad time, and that the beau-
ty, wisdom and courage of her art will endure 
for generations to come.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
Y 
QUAD 
CITIES ROW TEAM FOR WINNING 
THEIR 7TH STRAIGHT TITLE AT 
THE NATIONAL LEVEL 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Y Quad Cities Row team for win-
ning their 7th straight title at the national level. 
The Y Quad Cities Row team consisting of 
Ava Satterfield, Olivia Meskan, Ella Saunders 
and Elizabeth Tessen finished first in the girl’s 
quadruple sculls, winning their 7th consecutive 
national title. Their historic reign began in 
2014 but suddenly came to a halt as the pan-
demic hit Illinois. The Y Quad Cities Row team 
is the first team ever in the history of the event 
to place 1st and 2nd. As a former athlete, I 
understand the amount of hard work and com-
mitment it takes to pull off such an amazing 
feat. I am proud there is such young talent in 
our district, and happy to see them represent 
the Quad Cities so well throughout the state 
and country. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Ava, Olivia, Ella, and Elizabeth that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again formally recognize them for winning their 
7th consecutive national title in rowing.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
SERVICE OF EMBRA JACKSON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Embra Jackson, a member of the Montford 
Point Marines. Mr. Jackson fought bravely 
alongside twenty thousand African American 
men who joined the armed forces during 
World War II. Embra and countless other Afri-
can American men served their country over-
seas while the fight for civil rights continued at 
home. 
Embra completed basic training at Montford 
Point Camp, North Carolina, which remained 
segregated. He fought for the United States in 
the Pacific, and many of his fellow Marines 
continued their service through the wars in 
Korea and Vietnam. 
The Montford Point veterans made an in-
valuable impact on the rich history of the Ma-
rine Corps. Their efforts at home and abroad 
aided President Truman in his 1948 decision 
to desegregate the military. After 64 years, the 
112th Congress awarded the Montford Point 
Marines the Congressional Gold Medal for pa-
triotism and distinguished achievement. 
I am grateful for Embra Jackson’s lifetime of 
service to this great nation and the United 
States Marine Corps.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of this body and the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, as a witness to some 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
social 
and 
political 
changes in American life and society, and as 
a legislator dedicated to advancing public poli-
cies that improve the quality of life for all 
Americans and that make equality of oppor-
tunity and equal justice for all not just a virtue 
but a fact of American life, I rise to pay tribute 
to an unsung hero of the American Experi-
ment, Jesse Frank Berry, who died at his 
home in Rockville, Maryland on Monday, Au-
gust 9, 2021, at the age of 88. 
In these tumultuous days of crisis and chal-
lenge, Members of Congress know well, per-
haps better than most, how blessed our nation 
is to have such exceptional men and women 
who will go on to become leaders in their local 
communities, states, and the nation in the 
areas of business, education, law, govern-
ment, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and 
the military. 
We know this because we see them and 
benefit from their contributions every day as 
they serve the American people in our offices 
doing amazing work as congressional staff 
members. 
What produces such persons and inspires 
them to want to do what they do and to do it 
so well? 
Madam Speaker, as Occam’s razor posits, 
the answer is pretty simple and straight-
forward; they come from all over the nation, 
and they are produced and nurtured and in-
spired by their first role-models and heroes: 
their mothers and fathers. 
The life of Jesse Frank Berry, the father of 
my Chief Counsel, illustrates this perfectly, 
and I want to share briefly with all Members

his accomplishments and experiences that 
provided so much pride and motivation to his 
four children, five. grandchildren, three great- 
grandchildren, his siblings, surviving relatives, 
friends and loved ones, and the thousands of 
persons he never met. 
Jesse Frank Berry was born on September 
13, 1932, in Asheville, North Carolina, the first 
of the five children of Thomas and Eva Berry, 
descendants of South Carolina slaves and 
sharecroppers who survived daily indignities 
and injustices and nightly reigns of terror and 
violence. 
Jesse Berry’s family was part of the historic 
‘‘Great Migration’’ that saw millions of black 
Americans migrate from the de jure seg-
regated rural South in search of greater eco-
nomic opportunity and freedom in the urban 
North. 
The family of Jesse Berry, parents and sib-
lings Dorothy, Doris, Thomas Leon, and El-
mira, settled in on the east side of Cleveland, 
Ohio, in what is today the 11th Congressional 
District of Ohio, the district that sent Louis 
Stokes to the House of Representatives as 
Ohio’s first African American congressman. 
While Jesse Berry’s father provided for the 
family working as mechanic and handyman 
and his mother provided a loving home, Jesse 
took advantage of the opportunity to attend 
school beyond the elementary grades and ex-
celled in mathematics, mechanical design, and 
drafting as a student at East Tech High 
School, the alma mater of another and more 
famous Jesse, the legendary Olympic cham-
pion Jesse Owens, who did as much as any-
one to discredit on the world stage Adolf Hit-
ler’s false creed of white supremacy and his 
big lie that Aryans were the master race. 
After graduating from high school, Jesse 
Berry worked at a local factory in Cleveland 
for several years before being called to serve 
his country during the Korean War, where he 
served in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army. 
In December 1953, Jesse Berry married 
Bonnie Agnew and to this union was born four 
children, sons Jeffrey Thomas, Gregory Alan, 
Michael Leonard, and daughter Bonnie Eileen, 
all of whom would later go on to graduate 
from college and lead productive and con-
structive lives as lawyers, professors and 
teachers, serviceman, health counselors, and 
entertainment industry entrepreneurs. 
In 1959, Jesse Berry and his wife Bonnie 
led what would soon be another great migra-
tion, heading west to California where Jesse 
had been accepted into the prestigious elec-
trical engineering program at the University of 
Southern California in Los Angeles, which he 
was able to finance with the G.I. Bill benefits 
he earned for his active duty service in the 
U.S. Army. 
He would later earn a master’s degree in 
electronic engineering from California State 
University at Long Beach. 
After graduating from USC in 1962, Jesse 
Berry began his career as an electronic engi-
neer, designing submarine sonar systems that 
were vital in securing America’s victory in the 
Cold War, working for several of the country’s 
leading aerospace companies and defense 
contractors, including Hughes Aircraft, North 
American Rockwell, General Dynamics, and 
Honeywell. 
But while America was engaged in the Cold 
War on the international stage, domestically 
the demand of the Civil Rights Movement for 
a new social order of equal justice and oppor-
tunity for all was raging. 
As Bob Dylan put it so memorably in his im-
mortal ‘‘The Times They are a-Changin’’: 
The line it is drawn 
The curse it is cast 
The slow one now 
Will later be fast 
As the present now 
Will later be past 
The order is rapidly fadin’ 
And the first one now 
Will later be last 
For the times they are a-changin’ 
Patriotic but ordinary Americans of goodwill, 
who deeply loved their country but harboring a 
passion for justice answered the call. 
And in that number was Jesse Berry, the 
electronic engineer and sonar systems expert, 
who was active in the local Urban League and 
civil rights groups. 
Because of his exceptional organizing and 
logistical skills, Jesse Berry was elected to 
serve as President of the NAACP for the Or-
ange County, California chapter, where he 
spearheaded voting registration drives, edu-
cational symposia, awareness events, and 
consulted with civil rights leaders from across 
the state and around the country. 
In April 1968, violence and destruction 
swept many areas of the nation following the 
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessee, but the city 
of Santa Ana in Orange County, California, 
was left unscathed. 
That is due in no small measure to the wise 
counsel and guidance the heartbroken and an-
guished black residents of the city received 
from their respected leader, Jesse Berry, who 
organized a memorial service at the local mu-
nicipal stadium attended by thousands who 
comported themselves with dignity out of re-
spect and acceptance of Dr. King’s philosophy 
of nonviolence. 
The following year Jesse Berry would make 
history becoming the first African American to 
win elective office in Orange County, Cali-
fornia, securing a seat on the Santa Ana 
Board of Education. 
Throughout his life, Jesse Berry was the 
person that friends, neighbors, relatives, and 
persons who only knew him by reputation, 
went to for wisdom, advice, guidance, encour-
agement, or assistance. 
But despite the pressing demands on his 
time and for his attention, Jesse Berry always 
remembered he was a dad to four children, 
stressing the importance of a good education 
and instilling in them a love of learning, show-
ing them how to solve story problems and 
helping them with their homework, teaching 
them to swim, and to play baseball and not to 
be judgmental but to treat all persons with re-
spect and dignity. 
One of the things that was most dear to 
Jesse Berry was his love of nature and his-
tory; on cross-country trips back to visit rel-
atives, he would often take detours and make 
side trips so his children could visit and expe-
rience the places and events that shape so 
much of their lives and instill in them a sense 
of wonder, awe, and appreciation. 
So it was not at all unusual for Jesse Berry 
to regard Gettysburg, Valley Forge, Yosem-
ite’s Half Dome or Yellowstone’s Ol’ Faithful, 
the Badlands of South Dakota, the Grand 
Canyon, Death Valley, the Petrified Forest, 
New Mexico’s Carlsbad Caverns, Gettysburg, 
the Missouri Courthouse where the case of 
Dred Scott was decided, and United States 
Capitol as on the way from Los Angeles to 
Cleveland. 
And Jesse Berry delighted in photographing 
these events to chronicle the adventure and 
relive the good times with his friends and 
neighbors as they watched the slideshow on 
his projection screen that he was the first to 
own. 
Madam Speaker, the life of Jesse Frank 
Berry reflects so much the experiences of the 
ancestors of millions of persons of color in our 
great nation. 
Jesse Berry lived through 16 presidents, 5 
wars, the Great Depression and the Great Re-
cession of 2008, the era of Jim Crow and the 
Great Society, the transcendent presidencies 
of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first 
black president, and the election of Kamala 
Harris, the first woman and person of color 
elected Vice-President of the United States. 
Jesse Berry knew the anger and resentment 
that comes naturally to one whose family has 
been refused accommodations at motel or 
service in a restaurant because of their race. 
Jesse Berry knew the pride of wearing the 
uniform of his country even though at the time 
he was denied many of the rights he was will-
ing to risk his life to defend. 
He knew the sacrifice it took to become the 
first in his family to graduate from college and 
the satisfaction that comes with the realization 
of a longheld goal. 
Jesse Berry never lost faith in his country; 
instead, he worked to do his part to help it live 
up to the true meaning of its creed that all per-
sons are created equal, and he passed that 
conviction and determination on to his children 
and everyone he touched during his remark-
able nearly nine decade sojourn—on earth. 
Madam Speaker, like so many others 
stretching all the way back to Saul, Jesse 
Berry ran the great race, he finished the 
course, he kept the faith, and he has now 
gone on to his great reward. 
We can all find solace in the words of the 
philosopher Sophocles who said: One must 
wait until the evening to know how splendid 
the day has been. 
To Jesse’s widow, Mazel Pernell, his sib-
lings, children, relatives, neighbors, friends, 
and loves ones, but especially to his beloved 
grandchildren Samantha, Shyeita, Michael, 
Connor, and Jesse, and his great-grand-
children Alexis, Desmond, and Sydney, I hope 
it is a comfort to you that so many persons 
share your grief and are mourning the loss of 
a truly consequential life well lived. 
I ask the House to observe a moment of si-
lence in memory of Jesse Frank Berry, who 
spent his life in service to his Lord, his family, 
his friends, communities, and to the nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

August 13, 2021 
Chief Johnson was born on April 3, 1942, 
on the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas In-
dian Reservation, located just outside of Liv-
ingston, Texas. After graduating high school, 
he enrolled at Jacksonville College in Jack-
sonville, Texas, where he demonstrated his 
skills on the basketball court. In 1963, Mr. 
Johnson was selected as an All-American 
after setting the then all-time national record of 
scoring 67 points in a single game. Last year, 
Jacksonville College recognized him as a Dis-
tinguished Alumnus. 
A member of the Beaver Clan, Chief John-
son served his community in various capac-
ities over the years, including being twice 
elected to the Tribal Council and working as 
the Tribal Security Director for more than 21 
years. On October 5, 2013, he was elected as 
the Tribe’s Second Chief and remained in that 
position until being installed as Principal Chief 
following the passing of Chief Clem Sylestine, 
Mikko Colabe III, in 2019. In addition to his 
dedicated service to his tribe, Mr. Johnson sat 
on the Big Sandy ISD School Board for 48 
years and was a faithful member of the Indian 
Presbyterian Church, serving as a devoted 
deacon and elder for many years. 
Madam Speaker, today we remember the 
life and legacy of Herbert G. Johnson, Sr., and 
express our deep appreciation for his leader-
ship as a proud member and Principal Chief of 
the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. My 
heartfelt prayers remain with his family and 
tribe members during this difficult time.

RECOGNIZING ARIEL TORRES FOR 
HIS 
IMPRESSIVE 
SHOWING 
AT 
THE 2020 TOKYO OLYMPICS 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ariel Torres, whose hard 
work and dedication led him to earn a bronze 
medal in the men’s karate kata at the 2020 
Tokyo Olympics. 
Born in Cuba, Ariel’s family settled in Hia-
leah, Florida, when he was only four years 
old. As a young child, he turned to karate to 
manage his hyperactivity after being encour-
aged to do so by his doctor. Ariel’s family has 
been his biggest support system throughout 
his career and his achievements would not be 
possible without their unwavering dedication. 
Like most looking to rebuild their lives, his 
family had very little when they arrived in the 
United States, but still encouraged Ariel to 
pursue his dreams. One instance of this was 
when Ariel, at age eleven, wanted to attend a 
tournament in North Carolina but his parents 
could not afford to send him. Instead of giving 
up, his parents and Ariel put on an exhibition, 
where he performed karate moves at an inter-
section to ask for donations from people driv-
ing by. Ariel and his family did this for weeks 
until they saved up enough money to attend 
the tournament, where he won both competi-
tions that occurred. 
Ariel’s family continued to support his 
dreams and encouraged him throughout his 
career, shaping him into the dedicated young 
man that he is today. He is a four-time USA 
Karate SeniorTeam Member, a two-time USA 
Karate National Champion, and now, an Olym-
pic bronze medalist. When Ariel learned that 
karate would be included in the 2020 Olym-
pics, he envisioned himself competing at the 
highest level on that world stage. It was an 
honor to witness Ariel’s performance in Tokyo 
and see him bring an impressive victory back 
to Hialeah. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to know 
that such a committed young man resides in 
South Florida. His life story and perseverance 
serve as an inspiration for all—that no dream 
is too big to achieve. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing this outstanding indi-
vidual.

Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Mattie Kindelsperger, a senior 
at Sherrard High School, who won the Illinois 
High School Association’s Class 1A state 
championship in the 3200-meter run. 
Mattie beat her qualifying time by twelve 
seconds to win the state championship with a 
time of 11:19.93. As a former student athlete, 
I understand the time that goes into being 
awarded such a title, and I applaud Mattie’s 
persistence and hard work to archive her 
goals. I am proud to see her represent 
Sherrard exceptionally well throughout the 
state. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Mattie that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Mattie Kindelsperger on her state 
championship, and I join the entire Sherrard 
community in wishing her every success in the 
future.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Gary 
Dedeaux who passed away August 4, 2021. 
He was born March 31, 1956 in West Point to 
Ruth Murray and Dr. Howard Dedeaux. 
Gary was known for his humility and com-
passion. He was a successful entrepreneur in 
Columbus and West Point. He enjoyed farm 
work, shooting, and above all flying. Gary was 
a member of Faith Baptist Church and sought 
to live in a way that honors Christ. 
Left to cherish his memory are Gary’s wife 
Natalie; daughter Gina; son Richard; and 
grandson Thomas Lane. I join countless oth-
ers in mourning Gary’s loss and offer my most 
sincere condolences to his loved ones. 
IN HONOR OF JOHN WALCZAK’S 
RETIREMENT AND SERVICE TO 
LOUISVILLE 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of John Walczak, the 
longtime Director of the Louisville Zoo, as he 
enters retirement. 
John joined the Louisville Zoo in 1985 and 
assumed the role of Director in 2004, just a 
few years before I got to Congress. In my first 
year, I got to take a behind-the-scenes tour 
with John where I had the good fortune to 
spend a day interacting and playing with the 
animals. I felt like a kid all over again, and it’s 
a day I’ll never forget. 
I also saw firsthand the attention and love 
that John and his staff brought to every animal 
in their care. It’s a passion that has spread 
throughout our community and the tens of 
thousands of Louisville families who have 
happy memories at the zoo. 
The Louisville Zoo has long been an asset 
to our community, but in John’s 35 years 
there, its place in our hearts has solidified and 
grown. During his esteemed tenure, John 
oversaw the construction of several award- 
winning exhibits, including the Gorilla Forest 
and Glacier Run, and created renowned edu-
cational programs that taught our community 
about the beauty of the natural world. In the 
last 17 months when threats to public health 
seemed impossible to avoid, John and his 
team quickly adapted, ensuring that the zoo 
could be a safe place for families to enjoy. 
Under John’s leadership, the Louisville Zoo 
has won the Association of Zoos and Aquar-
iums’ Significant Achievement in Education 
Award for the School and Zoo program, intro-
ducing hundreds of children to the importance 
of wildlife conservation. He also facilitated the 
creation of the Little Penguin Conservation 
Center and the Cub House, the Zoo’s first 
early childhood learning space. After over 35 
years of service, John’s commitment to his 
staff, his community, and the animals under 
his care has helped establish the Louisville 
Zoo as one of Kentucky’s finest cultural institu-
tions. 
In short, the Louisville Zoo is an absolute 
treasure to our community and the region, 
touching and improving countless lives, and 
providing a happy home for nature’s wonders. 
John Walczak is a huge reason why, and we 
are grateful for his service. 
On behalf of the people of Kentucky’s Third 
Congressional District and the city of Louis-
ville, thank you, Mr. Walczak, for your leader-
ship and service. I wish you the best in your 
retirement.

was founded in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2018 
as the first coffee shop of its kind to serve or-
ganic Yemeni coffee to Dearborn and beyond. 
Qahwah House’s status as a Dearborn institu-
tion is worthy of commendation. 
Qahwah House’s mission is to provide cus-
tomers with an exceptional coffee experience, 
using high quality premium organic coffee 
sourced from Ibrahim’s family farm in Yemen. 
Since 2018, the shop has grown exponentially 
and has expanded its offerings to include au-
thentic Yemini pastries. The popularity of the 
coffee shop has pushed Ibrahim to establish 
two additional locations, one in Canton, Michi-
gan, and another in Brooklyn, New York—with 
more locations to come. The cafe that started 
out as just the idea of sharing delicious Yem-
eni coffee with neighbors has become a gath-
ering spot for the people of Dearborn and be-
yond. 
A household name in Southeast Michigan, 
Qahwah House has become a place for 
Michiganders of all ages and cultures. As an 
establishment that serves up more than just 
delicious coffee, they serve the local commu-
nity by raising funds for the education of our 
youth. Hundreds of children in the Dearborn 
area and in Ibrahim’s home of Yemen have 
benefited from their generosity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ibrahim Al Hasbani of Qahwah 
House for being a cultural ambassador of the 
Yemeni community and for sharing his cultural 
roots for the world to enjoy.

HONORING ALY HERNANDEZ FOR 
HER 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
FIFTH 
DISTRICT 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the extraordinary ac-
tions and efforts of an individual that improved 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, Aly 
Hernandez. Ms. Hernandez has been an inte-
gral part of the Kansas City community and it 
is with a bittersweet feeling that we say good-
bye to her as she ventures into a new oppor-
tunity in Washington D.C. 
Expressing the magnitude of Ms. Hernan-
dez’s contributions to Kansas City, in such a 
short time since she completed her bachelor’s 
degree at the University of Missouri—Kansas 
City, is an impossible task. From the time that 
Aly began working in my office as an intern, 
it was evident that she was someone who was 
determined and passionate about creating 
positive change in our city, particularly within 
our underrepresented communities. Ms. Her-
nandez rose through the ranks in my office 
starting as an intern, to fellow, and finally be-
coming a community affairs liaison-full time 
staff member. Not only has she left an impact 
on a federal level, but she also continued her 
journey in public service by serving the local 
municipality as the External Affairs Manager 
for Mayor Quinton Lucas for more than two 
years. Through these positions, she sought to 
leverage the voice of others and aided in in-
creasing resources to the Latino community 
within the Fifth Congressional District. 
As a strong advocate for Latinos, Ms. Her-
nandez took it upon herself to be one of the 
founders of a local organization Voz KC (or 
Voice KC), a new organization focused on ad-
vocating and advancing the role the Latino 
community in politics. Her own experience and 
journey as an immigrant from Mexico, search-
ing for the American Dream, along with her 
family, made her see the challenges of being 
undocumented, underrepresented, making her 
search for opportunities where she could have 
an impact. With her advocacy, she has 
worked to make civic engagement accessible 
for everyone. 
With Aly’s work in government in the 5th 
District of Missouri, we see a noticeable 
change in civic engagement and participation 
in our local communities. She is a perfect ex-
ample of what an exceptional American is and 
truly captures the fulfillment of the ‘‘American 
Dream’’. Everyone should hope to aspire to 
achieve the same qualities that this young 
woman has. I undoubtedly know that she will 
continue to do amazing things not only in 
Washington D.C., but for the rest of our coun-
try. Madam Speaker and colleagues, please 
join me in honoring Aly Hernandez’s impact on 
the people of Kansas City, and congratulating 
her on a new career opportunity in Wash-
ington D.C.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
SAMUEL LARRY RICHEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. Samuel Larry Richey who passed away 
Saturday, July 17 at NMMC Nursing Home in 
Pontotoc. He was a dedicated basketball 
coach, husband, and father. I join his family, 
friends, and loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Mr. Richey did not expect or plan on be-
coming a boys basketball coach. He was hired 
as a teacher at Jumpertown and was hired as 
the assistant coach in 1967. He coached in 
Wheeler, Baldwyn and Mantachie over the 
course of his career. He brought seventeen 
boys teams to the Mississippi State Tour-
nament and won six. His team was once 
ranked 29th all-time in the National Federation 
of Schools record book. He was named 
‘‘Coach of the Year: in multiple publications 
and by the time of his retirement, he was the 
winningest coach in Mississippi history. 
Mr. Richey holds a bachelor’s degree in 
business from Mississippi State University and 
served in the United States Armed Forces 
from 1958–1960. He was a member of Asbury 
Methodist church and enjoyed raising cattle, 
playing golf, and watching westerns. 
Left to cherish his memory are wife of 57 
years, Dale Gardner Richey; sons, Clark and 
Clay; grandsons Gardner, Gabe, Reggie, 
Maddux, Rob and Walker; granddaughters 
Kate, Lee-Anna, and Rylee. 
I am grateful for Mr. Richey’s legacy and the 
positive impact he had on countless young 
athletes. I offer my most sincere condolences 
to those who had the opportunity to know and 
love him.

THE 
ROCKRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL CHO-

1ST PLACE IN THE IHSA CLASS B 
MUSIC SWEEPSTAKES 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Rockridge High School 
Chorus Department for taking 1st place in the 
IHSA Class B Music Sweepstakes. 
The IHSA Music Sweepstakes is an annual 
competition that judges solo and ensemble 
performances based on tone, technique, per-
formance, creativity and other metrics. The ex-
ceptional performances secured Rockridge’s 
sixth State Championship in the last ten years. 
It gives me great pleasure to see these stu-
dents thriving both in school and with their 
peers despite the challenges of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
It is because of talented and determined in-
dividuals such as these students that I am es-
pecially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again formally congratulate the Rockridge 
High School Chorus Department on being 
named Class B State Champions. I commend 
their hard work and perseverance, and I am 
very proud to be their Representative.

RECOGNIZING EDUARDO A. GARZA 
ROBLES 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Eduardo A. Garza Robles for 
winning the Laredo Chamber of Commerce’s 
Businessperson of the Year award. Mr. Garza 
has demonstrated the utmost dedication to his 
community through his many years as a cus-
toms broker. 
Mr. Garza began his career as a customs 
broker in 1987 after working his way to the 
title of general manager of a customs broker 
firm. Shortly after obtaining his license as a 
Mexican customs broker, he founded his own 
customs agency in 1988. His company, Uni- 
Trade Group, has developed into a significant 
institution in international trade, especially in 
the United States and Mexico. Uni-Trade 
Group has over 15 offices internationally and 
its global presence through its alliances and 
partnerships has allowed it to cover 50 coun-
tries. 
Along with owning and operating a success-
ful Mexican customs agency, Mr. Garza diver-
sified his business in other industries and con-
solidated them as a 3PL company, offering 
services such as transportation, logistics, 
bonded warehouses, and free trade zones. He 
used his expertise and knowledge from oper-
ating Uni-Trade Group to expand to other in-
dustries such as oil and gas, commercial and 
residential real estate development, insurance, 
and graphic design, creating many job oppor-
tunities for the people of his community. Be-
tween 2003 and 2013, Mr. Garza served three 
year-long terms as Vice-President and Sec-
retary of the Association of the Customs Bro-
kers Association of Guadalajara, Jalisco.

Mr. Garza has been a true leader and influ-
ential figure in our community. In 2017, his 
company Uni-Trade Group hosted the NAFTA 
Roundtable Discussion to discuss the signifi-
cance of NAFTA, now the USMCA. This event 
brought together local private sector leaders, 
directors of public institutions, as well as 
Texas lawmakers like me and Senator JOHN 
CORNYN. He has also been a prominent mem-
ber of the Catholic Church in Laredo, Texas. 
Eduardo has been a friend throughout the 
years, and we have partnered on numerous 
occasions to better improve binational trade. 
Eduardo, I congratulate you for winning this 
award, and I wish you, your wife Juantia, your 
six children and seven grandchildren many 
more years of prosperity.

RECOGNIZING THE U.S. NAVAL 
ACADEMY CLASS OF 1970 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate the U.S. Naval Academy’s Class of 
1970 on the fiftieth reunion that it celebrated 
over the past year. It has been an honor to 
support the U.S. Naval Academy as the Rep-
resentative from Maryland’s Fifth Congres-
sional District and to nominate outstanding 
candidates for admission each year from our 
communities. With the Academy located in our 
neighboring district, bright and talented stu-
dents from Fifth District high schools have 
long been drawn to Annapolis for the next 
step in their education and service to country 
and community. The Naval Academy has a 
proud history of developing excellence in edu-
cation and shaping the character of its past 
and present graduates, and it continues to 
train future leaders of the Navy and of our 
country. The Class of 1970 exemplifies the 
high-quality standards of the Academy and of 
the Navy, and I know that many of its alumni 
had been looking forward to celebrating its fif-
tieth reunion in 2020. Because of the pan-
demic, however, they could not gather in per-
son last year; thankfully, they are planning to 
convene this Labor Day weekend. 
The U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1970 
began its journey as midshipmen in 1966, dur-
ing the height of the Vietnam War. They 
stepped up, knowing that after graduation 
many would be sent into combat as Navy and 
Marine Corps officers. That it was such a chal-
lenging time for our nation and for our military 
did not deter them; instead, it made them 
more determined to graduate with honor and 
serve with distinction. 
From their graduation day onward, this class 
has set a very high standard, with impressive 
accomplishments and careers. Members of 
this class fought valiantly in the Vietnam War, 
the Gulf War, and other conflicts over the past 
half-century. They served in the air, on land, 
at sea, and beneath the sea. Members of this 
class have served at the very highest level of 
our military, including twenty-seven flag offi-
cers—one of whom was Vice Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. The class includes six 
who were appointed as deputy assistant sec-
retaries or above in the federal government. 
Members have served their local communities 
as elected officials, and the class also boasts 
chief executive officers for major corporations, 
many of which we are all very familiar—such 
as Pepsico, General Motors, and Amgen. The 
class also produced a Member of this House, 
former Rep. Ronald Machtley, and a Member 
of Congress in the Philippines who later 
served that country as its National Security 
Advisor. The Class of 1970 also produced five 
Academy Distinguished Graduates, tied for the 
most from any single graduating class. 
The U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1970 ex-
emplifies the Navy ethos of ‘‘Honor, Courage, 
and Commitment.’’ These values have defined 
its graduates’ contributions to our country and 
their dedication to public service. Like many 
others before and who have followed, they 
sacrificed through long deployments, separa-
tion from loved ones, challenging trials, and 
tests that most Americans cannot fathom. 
Some even sacrificed their lives carrying out 
their missions. I know that new generations of 
midshipmen and future Navy and Marine 
Corps officers will be inspired by the rich herit-
age of service passed down to them by the 
Class of 1970. 
As the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1970 
gathers to mark fifty-one years of service to 
our nation and to the U.S. Navy, Marine 
Corps, Air Force, Army, and Naval Academy, 
it is with great pride and pleasure that I offer 
my congratulations and my thanks for their 
contributions to the safety and well-being of 
our country. I hope my colleagues will join me 
in wishing continued fair winds and following 
seas to the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 
1970.

HONORING DUVAL COUNTY JUDGE 
GILBERTO URESTI 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor former Duval County 
Judge, Gilberto Uresti, for his service to Duval 
County and South Texas. 
Judge Uresti was born on March 12, 1935, 
in Kingsville, Texas, to Elijio Uresti and Maria 
Mun˜oz. He grew up in Benavides, Texas and 
graduated from Benavides High School as the 
Salutatorian in 1954. After high school, Judge 
Uresti obtained a Bachelor’s of Science in 
Pharmacy from the University of Texas at 
Austin. Upon graduation, Judge Uresti moved 
back to Benavides and worked at DeLeon 
Pharmacy for over forty years, eventually be-
coming part owner. During this time Judge 
Uresti married Maria Olga Carrillo, his high 
school sweetheart, and had four children: 
Aaron Rene, Belinda Marie, Patricia Annette, 
and Gilbert Mario. 
Judge Uresti was appointed to serve as the 
Duval County Judge on October 31, 1975, by 
the judge of the 197th District Court, Judge 
Darrell Hester. During his tenure as County 
Judge, Judge Uresti focused on tackling the 
rampant corruption in Duval County which had 
bankrupt the local government. His efforts to 
improve the county’s stature and financial 
standing earned Uresti three terms as Duval 
County Judge, from October 31, 1975 to De-
cember 31, 1986, and from January 1, 1991 to 
December 31, 1994. 
Judge Uresti gained recognition not only 
from his peers throughout South Texas, but 
from the National Association of Counties. His 
dedication to his community and conviction to 
follow through on commitments made him one 
of the most influential figures in South Texas. 
During and following his appointment, Duval 
County saw the creation of community cen-
ters, new parks, nutritional services for the el-
derly, housing rehabilitation programs, and a 
Youth Conservation Corps. Under Judge 
Uresti’s leadership, Duval County was eventu-
ally voted Top County in the Nation by the Na-
tional Association of Counties. 
In addition to his accomplishments as a 
County Judge, he also served as Chairman of 
the Coastal Bend Council of Governments, a 
member of the Governor’s Regional Review 
Committee, Chairman of the Community Ac-
tion Council of South Texas, and a member of 
the National Association of Counties Board of 
Directors. 
Madam Speaker, Judge Uresti is an incred-
ible leader and unwavering commitment to 
South Texans who will be remembered for 
generations to come. He is a man of his word, 
intelligent and disciplined, who treated people 
with respect and took responsibility. I stand 
here today to thank Judge Uresti for his con-
tributions to Duval County and all of South 
Texas.

BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE 
ISRAEL-GAZA CEASEFIRE 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today re-
garding the cease-fire brokered between Israel 
and Gaza earlier this year after 11 days of at-
tacks against Israel. I include in the RECORD 
the following article, ‘‘Let This Be the Last 
Israel-Gaza Ceasefire’’ published by CNN on 
May 25, 2021, written by Ambassador Motaz 
Zahran. 
[From CNN, May 24, 2021] 
LET THIS BE THE LAST ISRAEL-GAZA 
CEASEFIRE 
(By Ambassador Motaz Zahran) 
Egypt worked around the clock over the 
past two weeks to end the deadly fighting be-
tween our Palestinian and Israeli neighbors. 
Since the early hours of the conflict, Egyp-
tian mediators led de-escalation talks with 
both Hamas and Israeli leadership. We sup-
ported humanitarian efforts on the ground, 
including by opening the Rafah border cross-
ing for the provision of immediate medical 
care to the injured in Gaza. Ultimately, in 
close partnership with the United States and 
others, we were able to broker a ceasefire. 
On Thursday, President Joe Biden called 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi re-
iterated the vital role mutual coordination 
between the US and Egypt can have in the 
region. Egypt will spare no resource in bring-
ing about peace in there, whenever violence 
erupts. This was true during the 2014 war, 
when we were instrumental in forging a 
truce. It was true during the conflict this 
May. And it will be true at any point in the 
future. 
However, we will also never accept the no-
tion that this cycle of bloodshed is inevi-
table. That is why we refuse to let this issue 
recede in international priorities—as it has 
in the past—until the next crisis emerges 
and imposes. 
Building a lasting solution must start now. 
Egypt is ready to do everything to help nego-
tiate a lasting peace to the core conflict in

the Middle East. We are calling on the US to 
work with us to restart that process imme-
diately. 
Egypt’s historic role in planting the seeds 
of peace, our substantive contributions to-
ward a Middle East peace plan, our prox-
imity to the conflict, and the direct rami-
fications of belligerency to our nation, all 
make Egypt singularly positioned to help re-
start negotiations toward a two-state solu-
tion between Palestinians and Israelis—and 
with the full span of their rights upheld; 
prime amongst them is statehood to the Pal-
estinians and security to the Israelis. But we 
need sustained international efforts. 
Working together, Egypt and the US can 
broker an honest and open dialogue with 
Israel on concrete steps it should take to 
work towards peace, such as refraining from 
taking any further steps detrimental to the 
wellbeing of the population and the status of 
the city of Jerusalem, which was occupied by 
Israel since the 1967 War. 
In turn, Cairo and Washington must im-
press on Palestinians the need to work for 
peace. While having the militants lay down 
their arms for good might seem a long way 
off, stopping further attacks is essential to 
move forward. Those factions rejecting peace 
efforts and seeking instability, whatever 
their name or affiliation is, have to be con-
tained, including by undermining their inter-
national network of support and finance. 
After all, armed attacks and military oper-
ations, whatever their cause is, never serve 
the path towards peace and only sets back 
the ultimate objective of a two-state solu-
tion. 
We must work to uphold and enable the 
Palestinian National Authority. Mahmoud 
Abbas, President of the Palestinian Author-
ity, has a crucial role in furthering any fu-
ture peace negotiations. His role as a na-
tional leader has been overshadowed by 
Hamas’ recent conflict with Israel, yet he 
has all the credentials and willingness to re-
turn to the table for serious and meaningful 
discussions. Elevating Abbas in the eyes of 
the world will bring him back into his his-
toric role as chief negotiator for the Pales-
tinian people; after all, no one on the Pales-
tinian side has worked more on the vision of 
a two state solution than President Abbas. 
A strong and lasting peace in the Middle 
East may seem far off given the recent 
heightened tensions in the West Bank, in-
cluding Jerusalem, and Gaza, but that 
should still be the goal for the US, Egypt 
and, most importantly, Israelis and the Pal-
estinians. 
We must continue to march forward to-
ward peace, or we risk continuing to suffer 
with this vicious cycle of despair and blood-
shed. 
The continued partnership between Egypt 
and the United States in peace efforts is a 
crucial cornerstone to achieving peace in the 
Middle East. It is indeed no coincidence that 
the latest ceasefire was declared mere hours 
after President Biden called President Al- 
Sisi. When it comes to giving peace a chance 
in the Middle East, Washington and Cairo 
must continue to work together as peace-
makers and arbiters.

Mr. Young was raised in the Brewer Com-

CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
LUTHERAN 
SOCIAL 
SERVICES OF NEVADA 
HON. SUSIE LEE 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the 25th anniversary of Lu-
theran Social Services of Nevada (LSSN), 
who serves our southern Nevada community. 
Throughout their 25 years of service, LSSN 
has provided help to more than 383,231 Las 
Vegans in need. 
What began as humble means of helping 
the community in 1985, in the form of a food 
pantry and clothing closet, LSSN has grown to 
an immense operation serving a multitude of 
southern Nevadans over the last 25 years that 
are low-income, at-risk of homelessness, 
homeless, families with or without children, 
youth, veterans, people with disabilities, and 
senior citizens. 
Despite the uncertainty and unprecedented 
challenges of the last 18 months of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, LSSN found further 
ways to redouble their efforts to the commu-
nity by distributing more than 770,596 pounds 
of food through their DigiMart Food Pantry to 
more than 62,840 people. This is nearly three 
times as many of Las Vegans they have 
served through the pantry prior to the pan-
demic. Additionally, LSSN provided rental as-
sistance and rapid rehousing resources to 167 
households in need. This allowed those fami-
lies to remain or become sheltered in the 
midst of a pandemic ravaging our Las Vegas 
community 
and 
economy. 
Finally, 
LSSN 
served more than 7,960 hot and well-balanced 
meals to seniors, while also teaching nutrition 
education and physical activity through Zoom 
and other remote means. 
It was my honor to visit and tour the LSSN 
DigiMart Food Pantry in May 2021, as they 
unveiled an expansion of the facility from 750 
square feet to 3,058 square feet. LSSN 
projects that this will allow them to serve an 
additional 5,000 families annually. 
I am in awe of the way our Nevada entities 
and community have continually stepped up to 
serve through numerous crises, and that grati-
tude extends to LSSN. I look forward to wit-
nessing their continued growth and success in 
the years to come, and I encourage everyone 
to join me in celebrating and honoring their 
25th anniversary.

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, while I agree with my colleagues 
about the importance of securing our Nation’s 
energy infrastructure, I am concerned that—as 
currently written—H.R. 2931, H.R. 2928, and 
H.R. 3119 may weaken the core tenets of the 
U.S. Government’s framework for protecting 
critical infrastructure. 
That framework is currently laid out in Presi-
dential Policy Directive 21 (PPD–21) and has 
been reinforced in numerous Federal policies 
and statutes enacted since 9/11. It has been 
embraced by Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations alike and by Congress. Earlier 
this year, Congress strongly reaffirmed its 
commitment to the PPD–21 framework in the 
FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act. 
PPD–21 designates the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) as the lead Federal 
agency responsible for coordinating Federal 
efforts to secure critical infrastructure across 
all 16 sectors—while working hand-in-hand 
with 
Sector 
Risk 
Management 
Agencies 
(SRMAs). 
I support enhancing the Department of En-
ergy (DOE)’s capacity, as the SRMA for the 
energy sector, to engage with the sector as a 
liaison, trusted partner, and valuable source of 
sector-specific expertise. 
That said, it is important that legislation au-
thorizing such activity acknowledge the role 
that DHS, through the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA), plays as the 
Nation’s risk advisor and Federal civilian inter-
face for private sector engagement and col-
laboration. 
Congress has often reiterated that it expects 
CISA to use its authorities and cross-sector 
convening power to maintain a bird’s eye view 
of threats across sectors—taking threat intel-
ligence from one sector and integrating it into 
a broader threat context to help other owners 
and operators protect themselves. 
But CISA can only do this if its SRMA part-
ners work with it in a collaborative way that 
complements—rather 
than 
duplicates—the 
tools, services, resources CISA brings in sup-
port of these broader efforts. 
Herein lies the issue with H.R. 2931, H.R. 
2928, and H.R. 3119: the measures, as draft-
ed, would authorize DOE to carry out respon-
sibilities and develop capabilities that overlap 
with or duplicate those already housed within 
CISA, and there is no directive for DOE to do 
so in coordination with DHS. 
There are several problems that could arise 
from this lack of coordination. 
First, it runs the risk of creating a siloed, 
stovepiped approach to managing information 
about threats to the energy sector—a critically 
important, lifeline sector that has been under 
sustained attack for decades. 
Congress has worked to break down these 
siloes since 9/11, which is why DHS was 
tasked as a ‘‘central hub’’ for critical infrastruc-
ture in the first place. 
Second, having multiple Federal agencies 
carry out overlapping roles and responsibilities 
creates confusion among private sector stake-
holders, who are not sure who to call during 
a crisis, or who to partner with during steady 
state. 
This duplication also means that the Federal 
Government is forced to spread an already 
thin supply of cybersecurity experts and re-
sources even thinner. 
Finally, cybersecurity is rarely—if ever—a 
sector-specific problem. 
Critical infrastructure is interconnected, and 
technologies used in one sector are often de-
ployed 
throughout 
others, 
as 
are 
the 
vulnerabilities 
embedded 
in 
those 
tech-
nologies. Adversaries can use the distributed 
nature of these vulnerabilities to exploit own-
ers and operators across industry lines, at 
scale. 
Take, for instance, the recent SolarWinds 
campaign. Russian intelligence agencies were 
able to corrupt a software update deployed 
across the public and private sectors, then use 
it as a foothold to infiltrate an equally ubiq-
uitous set of Microsoft tools and products to 
seize an untold amount of sensitive informa-
tion. 
Hostile foreign nations like China and Rus-
sia do not organize cyber operations one sec-
tor at a time. They wage simultaneous, par-
allel campaigns designed to yield the highest 
possible reward at the lowest possible cost. 
It is not uncommon for attacks on the en-
ergy sector to coincide with, or foreshadow, 
similar attacks on other sectors. In 2018, DHS 
and the FBI warned about a ‘‘multi-stage intru-
sion campaign’’ by Russia that targeted ‘‘U.S. 
government entities, as well as organizations 
in the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, 
water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sec-
tors.’’ 
While cyberattacks against the energy sec-
tor have accelerated, the sector does not exist 
in a vacuum. 
Though I am concerned about the possibility 
that these challenges may arise, it is not a 
foregone conclusion that they will. If DOE col-
laborates with CISA to forge a more produc-
tive and effective partnership, I believe many 
of these challenges can be overcome. 
Last year, I came to the floor to ask the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee to confirm his intent that the activities 
authorized by this legislation be carried out in 
coordination with DHS. He responded it was 
‘‘absolutely’’ his intent that these bills be car-
ried out with DHS ‘‘first and foremost.’’ 
I also asked for clarification that these bills 
do not detract from, erode, or infringe upon 
any existing authorities or policies laid out in 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Act of 2018, PPD–41, Executive Order 13636, 
or Executive Order 13691. He responded that 
‘‘nothing in these bills is intended to infringe, 
curtail, or otherwise affect authorities of [DHS] 
. . . in any way, shape, or form.’’ 
I would like to reiterate these commitments 
from one year ago, and I look forward to work-
ing with the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce to conduct vigorous oversight to ensure 
that DOE is coordinating with DHS in a man-
ner that reflects congressional intent.

CONGRATULATING 
REGINALD 
‘‘REG’’ 
POHLMAN 
ON 
HIS 
RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Reginald ‘‘Reg’’ Pohlman on 
his retirement as a Police Officer from the 
Carrollton Police Department. 
Reg joined the Carrollton Police Department 
on January 7, 1991 and dedicated over 30 
years in service to the Carrollton community 
first as a police officer, before being promoted 
to Assistant Chief. Reg received both the dis-
tinguished Medal of Honor and Officer of the 
Year award during his time at the police de-
partment. Reg spent much of his time an-
nouncing, coaching and serving as an out-
standing community advocate. He enjoys 
coaching and said it ‘‘keeps him young.’’ He 
served as an assistant coach to his brother, 
Greg Pohlman, for high school sports, includ-
ing baseball. Reg has always been generous 
with his time and when the community needed 
something, he was always willing to help. I 
want to thank Reg for his dedication to his 
community and as a former athlete, I appre-
ciate his kindness and generosity. 
It is because of leaders such as Reginald 
‘‘Reg’’ Pohlman that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate Reg Pohlman on his retirement.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Luke Reed 
who passed away on August 4, 2021. He was 
born in Starkville November 5, 2007 to Gina 
Dedeaux Reed and Tommy Reed. This year

REMEMBERING MARSHA MILLER 
BURDMAN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Marsha Miller Burdman, of Vi-
enna, Ohio, who passed away peacefully on 
Monday, August 9, 2021 at the age of 83. 
Marsha was born September 7, 1937, to 
Sally and Frank Miller in Toronto, Ohio. She 
grew up in Pittsburgh and, although she was 
an only child, she was blessed by the pres-
ence of 32 loving aunts and uncles and nu-
merous cousins. 
Marsha graduated from Taylor Allderdice 
High School in Squirrel Hill in 1955 and the 
University of Pittsburgh in 1959, where she re-
ceived her degree in education. She became 
a first-grade teacher at Forrest Hills Elemen-
tary School in Pittsburgh upon her graduation 
from Pitt. 
In 1960, after being fixed up on a blind date 
through a mutual friend, she met the love of 
her life, Kenneth Burdman of Youngstown. 
Following a short courtship, they were married 
November 13 of the same year. 
Marsha continued teaching first-graders in 
the Youngstown area in both the Hubbard and 
Austintown school districts for several years 
until she and Ken started their family in 1963. 
They raised four children and remained hap-
pily married for 34 years until Kenny’s passing 
in 1995. 
A voracious reader, Marsha also enjoyed 
traveling the world with her closest friends, 
cousins and other family members, as well as 
playing canasta, knitting and needlepointing; 
however, her most treasured moments were 
the countless memories from the regular fam-
ily visits and vacations with her four loving 
children, their spouses and 12 grandchildren 
who affectionately called her Mimi. 
A true woman of valor, Marsha had a tre-
mendous character and a calming presence, 
and was loved and admired by all who knew 
her. Her close circle of friends was endless 
and she was also an aunt and Mimi to many 
children and grandchildren of good friends 
who were like family. 
Marsha is survived by her son, Lee (Bonnie) 
of Canfield; daughters, Heidi (Robert) Bardach 
of Cincinnati, Stacey (Richard) Eastern of Se-
attle, Wash., and Janie Cowell of San Diego; 
and her 12 grandchildren, Korey, Taylor and 
Lexi Burdman, Ryan, Alyssa (fiance Max 
Fader) and Kelsey Bardach, Joshua, Emily 
and Zachary Eastern, and Samantha, Dillon 
and Brandon Cowell. 
I am so very lucky to have developed pro-
found relationships with Marsha’s son, Lee, 
and daughter-in-law, Bonnie. Both were instru-
mental leaders on so many important issues 
facing my Congressional District and the Jew-
ish community of the Mahoning Valley. My 
deepest condolences go out to Marsha’s fam-
ily and to all whose lives she so deeply 
touched. 
HONORING BRIGHAM HOEGH AND 
ERIN LAIN AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Brigham Hoegh and Erin Lain, 
founders of Corn 4 a Cause, as our Iowans of 
the Week. 
If you are from Iowa, have heard about 
Iowa, or have traveled through Iowa, you 
know that corn is not just part of our beautiful 
scenery, it’s also part of our heritage and cul-
ture. This cherished crop symbolizes and fos-
ters work, livelihoods, and communities across 
our great state. Even though Iowa has a rich 
agricultural industry producing bountiful crops 
like corn, many families here still struggle with 
access to fresh produce to put on their dinner 
tables. That’s why Brigham and Erin have 
come in to help. 
Brigham Hoegh and Erin Lain founded Corn 
4 a Cause roughly four years ago after 
Brigham had a surplus of sweetcorn. She 
teamed up with Erin to start their nonprofit or-
ganization that aims to address the issue of 
fresh produce access in communities around 
Iowa. 
Brigham’s family farm is in Cass County, 
Iowa, just north of Atlantic. Each year since 
Brigham and Erin started Corn 4 a Cause, 
they have planted, grown, and harvested 
sweetcorn to sell and donate across western 
Iowa. What’s amazing about their work is that 
for every dozen ears of com purchased, an-
other dozen ears are donated to different food 
pantries and other nonprofits aiming to provide 
fresh produce to those without consistent ac-
cess to it. This arrangement allows for those 
who are purchasing the com to gain valuable, 
eye-opening insight into food insecurity in their 
own communities. Not only do people get a 
sense of how prevalent the issue is, but 
they’re also able to help immediately by pur-
chasing a dozen ears of corn that will be 
matched by Corn 4 a Cause’s donation to 
local families. 
One acre of sweetcorn yields roughly 
15,000 ears of corn. Brigham and Erin have 
planted two acres of sweetcorn this year, 
which provides roughly 30,000 ears of corn to 
be sold and donated. 
Corn 4 a Cause started out serving commu-
nities and pantries primarily in western Iowa. 
However, Brigham and Erin quickly found 
more demand for their yields in other areas of 
the state and were harvesting so much 
sweetcorn that they needed to start getting 
more pantries and nonprofits involved. With 
more corn to go around, they have started ex-
panding their donations to central Iowa. 
Brigham and Erin focused on delivering 
fresh produce to those who need it. They are 
passionate about making fresh, Iowa-grown 
food accessible to more families in a socially 
conscious way. They state their values as: 
‘‘Full bellies. Summer fun. Local food. Equity 
first.’’ Corn 4 a Cause partners with organiza-
tions that serve communities of color to cul-
tivate a more equitable food system, and a 
more equitable society. Brigham and Erin also 
encourage anyone who loves to plant their 
own produce to plant some extra so it can be 
donated to food pantries and other nonprofits 
fighting to eliminate food insecurity in Iowa 
and America. 
Reliable and equitable access to food, let 
alone fresh, healthy produce, is a major issue 
across our country and in our own backyard. 
Organizations like Corn 4 a Cause and individ-
uals like Brigham and Erin are tackling these 
problems head-on at the ground level to make 
a difference for their neighbors. Because of 
their dedication and hard work, it is my honor 
to name Brigham Hoegh and Erin Lain of Corn 
4 a Cause as our Iowans of the Week.

MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR DR. 
MAXWELL SCARLETT 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor the legacy of Dr. Max-
well Scarlett—the first Black graduate of the 
University of Texas at Arlington and a Fort 
Worth physician who specialized in emergency 
medicine. 
Dr. Scarlett grew up in Fort Worth’s historic 
Stop Six neighborhood surrounded by a family 
of educators. His mother was a teacher, as 
were both of her grandparents. So, while 
growing up, Dr. Scarlett always knew that he 
would attend college. But what he didn’t know 
was that his graduation would break racial 
barriers. 
He initially enrolled at the University of 
North Texas (known then as North Texas 
State), and almost instantly began to break 
barriers. He was one of the first three African 
American men to live in a dorm there. Then, 
he integrated the school’s biology honor soci-
ety and later became the first Black student to 
grade papers and teach in the school’s 
Science Department. 
Dr. Scarlett transferred to UTA his senior 
year—three years after the school first inte-
grated. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree 
in biology in 1966. Looking around at his grad-
uation ceremony, he wondered if he was the 
only Black graduate that year. In fact, he was 
the first Black graduate in UTA’s entire history, 
a fact he did not learn until 1997—about 30 
years after his graduation. 
After graduating, Dr. Scarlett enrolled in 
medical school at Howard University. He later 
returned to Fort Worth to start his medical 
practice because he noticed there was a need 
for doctors back home. He even continued 
seeing emergency medicine patients after re-
tiring from his Fort Worth practice in 2014. 
Dr. Scarlett never set out to break barriers, 
but through his hard work and dedication, he 
did just that. He helped open doors for so 
many young African Americans, and many 
others who faced exclusion. Today, we honor 
his legacy, and may we continue to follow his 
lead in creating a more equal America.

HONORING THE TBK QUAD CITIES 
MARATHON FOR WINNING THE 
2020 
GOVERNOR’S 
HOMETOWN 
PROJECT AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the TBK Quad Cities Marathon for 
bringing together thousands of athletes, volun-
teers and speculators to the Moline region. 
The event was selected as a winner of the 
2020 Governor’s Hometown Project Award for 
the positive impact it had in the community. 
The TBK Quad Cities Marathon, a USATF 
certified course and great Boston Marathon 
qualifier, offers some of the most beautiful 
views of the Mississippi River. The 26.2 mile 
run covers four cities and two states in the 
Quad Cities region. Run by more than 1,400 
volunteers, it is a weekend full of activities that 
celebrates the accomplishments of these dedi-
cated runners. I applaud the TBK Quad Cities 
Marathon for their philanthropic work and 
showcasing the very best of the Moline com-
munity. 
I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District with community leaders 
like TBK Quad Cities Marathon. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally honor 
the TBK Quad Cities Marathon for their con-
tributions to the community and to congratu-
late them for receiving the 2020 Governor’s 
Hometown Project Award.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
TUPELO 
POLICE 
CHIEF 
BART 
AGUIRRE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the retirement of Tupelo 
Police Chief Bart Aguirre. 
Chief Aguirre has devoted himself to the city 
of Tupelo, faithfully serving and protecting the 
citizens for 36 years. Chief Aguirre answered 
the call to serve as a member of law enforce-
ment by first attending the University of Mis-
sissippi where he earned a bachelor’s degree 
in Legal Systems Administration. Later, Chief 
Aguirre earned a master’s degree in Criminal 
Justice at the University of Alabama. 
Prior to becoming a Tupelo Police Officer, 
Chief Aguirre aspired to work for the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation as a forensics expert, 
specializing in firearms. In 1985, TPD Chief 
Ed Crider hired Chief Aguirre to serve in the 
Patrol Division. Chief Aguirre said he fell in 
love with TPD and the rest is history. 
During his successful career, Chief Aguirre 
worked his way up from a patrolman to the 
Chief of Detectives. In 2013, he was named 
the Chief of Police by Tupelo Mayor Jason 
Shelton. 
During his career with the TPD, Chief 
Aquirre served on an F–B–I task force, car-
rying out a 4–year mission titled, ‘‘Operation 
Secondhand Smoke.’’ Chief Aguirre and his 
fellow task force members uncovered a 
scheme to transport stolen tobacco products 
across state lines. Their investigative work led 
to the multiple arrests and to the seizure of 
property. The seized land is where the new 
$10–million–dollar Tupelo Police Department 
was built. Chief Aguirre is proud of the instru-
mental role he played on the task force and 
the ultimate result of their hard work—a new 
police department. 
Chief Aguirre is the son of Conrado and 
Joan Aguirre. The family of five moved to 
Tupelo in 1962. His father worked as a sales-
man for a meat processing company that sold 
products to restaurants and supermarkets, 
Conrado was the owner of a popular res-
taurant called the Gaslight Inn. Later, he 
opened another restaurant called Gloster 205. 
Chief Aguirre grew up working in the res-
taurants while contemplating a future career in 
law enforcement. 
In 1997, Chief Aguirre married his wife, 
Patty. They have three children: Shane 
Aguirre; Jonathan Aguirre (Kirsten); and Arial 
Aguirre-Waldrop 
(Brent). 
They 
have 
five 
grandchildren: Gryder Aguirre; Grant Aguirre; 
Brooks Waldrop; Beyla Waldrop; and Baron 
Waldrop. 
Upon retirement, Chief Aguirre said he and 
his wife plan to spend more time with their 
children and grandchildren and travel. 
We wish Chief Aguirre and his family many 
more happy years together. We are grateful 
for the impact of men like Chief Aguirre. I 
commend him for his devotion to family, the 
citizens of Tupelo, and to our great Nation.

HONORING MAJOR HARVEY 
HARRELL STORMS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of a grateful nation, I rise 
today to recognize Major Harvey Harrell 
Storms of McAllen, Texas, who sacrificed his 
life in the Korean War. 
Major Storms was born in McAllen, Texas 
and was a proud member of the Texas A&M 
University Class of 1939. After receiving a 
bachelor’s degree in agriculture, he enlisted in 
the United States Army where he fought val-
iantly in World War II, earning the World War 
II Victory Medal. 
After Major Storms’ tour during World War 
II, he re-enlisted for the Korean War. There, 
he was a member of the Headquarters Com-
pany, 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry Regimental 
Combat Team, 7th Infantry Division. 
In November of 1950, Major Storms and his 
Company fought at the Battle of the Chosin 
Reservoir, a decisive but brutal battle marked 
by harsh icy conditions. Throughout the battle, 
Chinese soldiers had Major Storms and his 
soldiers pinned down. In an attempt to help 
them, Major Storms led an attack up Hill 1221. 
During this act of bravery, Major Storms was 
shot in the crossfire, reported missing in action 
on December 1, 1950, and declared dead on 
December 31, 2021. 
Major Storms, a loving husband and father 
of four, made the ultimate sacrifice to help free 
his fellow soldiers. Major Storms was deco-
rated with the Silver Star and Purple Heart 
honors for his leadership and valor. Unfortu-
nately, his remains were not recovered for 
over 70 years, until in 2018, when North 
Korea turned over 55 boxes of American serv-
ice members’ remains at the summit between 
former President Donald Trump and North Ko-
rean Leader Kim Jong–Un. It was then that 
Harvey Storms was finally returned home. 
On Friday, July 16, 2021, Major Storms was 
interred at the Arlington National Cemetery, 
and a rosette was placed next to his name on 
the Courts of the Missing at the National Me-
morial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, 
Hawaii, indicating that he had been accounted 
for. 
Madam Speaker, I want to honor the mem-
ory of Major Harvey Harrel Storms, and thank 
him for his service and sacrifice. He was an 
honorable, noble, accomplished, and impres-
sive soldier, one that our nation is so grateful 
for. As an American and Texan, I am touched 
by the actions he took to protect our country. 
I know that his legacy will inspire future gen-
erations to honorably serve their fellow man.

BRINGING ATTENTION TO GERD 
NEGOTIATIONS 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
bring attention to the negotiations regarding 
the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. I in-
clude in the RECORD the article, ‘‘Only Wash-
ington Can Save the Renaissance Dam Nego-
tiations Now,’’ written by Ambassador Motaz 
Zahran, published on April 29, 2021. 
[From Foreign Policy] 
ONLY WASHINGTON CAN SAVE THE 
RENAISSANCE DAM NEGOTIATIONS NOW 
(By Motaz Zahran, Ambassador of Egypt to 
the United States) 
In early April, Ethiopia thwarted yet an-
other mediation process, this time led by the 
African Union, to resolve an escalating crisis 
on the Nile—where Ethiopia is building the 
massive Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam 
(GERD), which would disrupt a primary 
source of water for Egypt and Sudan. The ne-
gotiations represented what the Egyptian 
foreign ministry called Ethiopia’s ‘‘last 
chance’’ at a resolution to the dispute, which 
has been ongoing for 10 years. 
With Ethiopia edging closer to unilaterally 
filling the dam’s reservoir for a second 
time—and thus crossing the ‘‘red line’’ set by 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi—it 
may be up to the United States to help 
broker a peaceful solution and prevent un-
rest in the region, which forces of extremism 
and terrorism would undoubtedly look to ex-
ploit. 
The Biden administration, which is cur-
rently mulling over the best policy for man-
aging this situation, must act now. At stake 
is the future of the Nile, a lifeline for mil-
lions of Egyptians and Sudanese. In 2011, 
without consulting either of its neighbors 
downstream, Ethiopia began constructing a 
509-foot-tall concrete dam—large enough for 
a reservoir that can store twice as much 
water as Lake Mead, the largest artificial 
reservoir in the United States—on the Blue 
Nile, a vital upstream portion of the Nile 
River. If unilaterally filled and operated, the 
GERD 
could 
inflict 
incalculable 
socio-
economic and environmental harm down-
stream in Egypt and Sudan. Last year, flout-
ing a 2015 treaty, Ethiopia started an initial 
filling of the dam.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E900 
August 13, 2021 
Now, balking at calls for an equitable reso-
lution and consistent with its established 
policy of unilaterally exploiting of inter-
national rivers, Ethiopia is vowing to press 
ahead with a second substantial phase of res-
ervoir filling this summer. 
The threat the GERD poses is not hypo-
thetical but real. Choking off an essential 
supply of water would exponentially increase 
the dangers posed by climate change in the 
region. As one of the most arid countries in 
the world, with less than one-sixteenth the 
amount of rainfall as Ethiopia, Egypt is al-
ready facing severe water shortages, largely 
because of rising temperatures and rising sea 
levels. In fact, Egyptians are currently living 
around 50 percent below the water-poverty 
line, and with very little annual rainfall, the 
country is almost entirely dependent on the 
Nile for renewable water. To manage such 
conditions, Egypt has adopted a nationwide 
system of reusing water several times for ag-
riculture, achieving one of the world’s high-
est overall irrigation system efficiencies. 
Despite Ethiopia’s claims that hydropower 
projects will cause no harm, the unilateral 
filling and operation of Ethiopia’s dam 
would quickly make matters far worse for 
both Egypt and Sudan, causing serious envi-
ronmental and socioeconomic damage, po-
tentially forcing droves of families from 
their homes. 
Further, the GERD would also have delete-
rious effects on Egypt’s Aswan High Dam, a 
multipurpose dam, which is the biggest 
source of renewable energy in Egypt and is 
indispensable in securing the water needs of 
Egypt and Sudan. The United Nations notes 
that every 2 percent drop in available water 
impacts 1 million people. 
An impact study, conducted by the rep-
utable Dutch firm Deltares, found that uni-
lateral filling of the GERD could lead to a 
water shortage in Egypt of more than 123 bil-
lion cubic meters, and that in the agricul-
tural sector alone, every 1 billion cubic 
meter shortage of water caused by unilateral 
filling or operation of the GERD, would re-
sult in forcing 290,000 people out of work, de-
stroying more than 321,230 acres of cul-
tivated land, an increase of $150 million in 
food imports, and a loss of $430 million of ag-
ricultural production. 
The threat the GERD poses is not hypo-
thetical but real. Right now, another dam 
built by Ethiopia is causing enormous harm 
in Kenya. The fallout is so severe that 
UNESCO warned of the extinction of Lake 
Turkana in Kenya. There has also been re-
porting and research on other Ethiopian uni-
lateral actions, including in the Juba and 
Shabelle basin, without prior consultation 
with Somalia, and their significant negative 
impact on water access and security in So-
malia. 
The social and economic instability trig-
gered by such unilateral policies could gen-
erate greater unrest in the region. And Ethi-
opia is stoking the flames by villainizing 
Sudan and Egypt by pushing the misleading 
populist narrative that attempts to charac-
terize any and all concerns about the GERD 
as being rooted in colonialism, claiming that 
its downstream neighbors are against Ethio-
pia’s development and are trying to impose 
upon Ethiopia ‘‘colonial treaties.’’ 
The situation as it stands today was en-
tirely avoidable. This mischaracterization is 
designed to allow Ethiopia to divert atten-
tion from its actual international legal obli-
gations toward its downstream neighbors, 
which include several international treaties 
that Ethiopia signed—all, with no single ex-
ception, as a sovereign independent state— 
including in 1902, 1993, and 2015. These trea-
ties served and continue to serve Ethiopia’s 
national interests, including, for example, in 
relation to its borders. Nonetheless, while 
Ethiopia has reaped the benefits from sign-
ing these treaties, it repeatedly attempted to 
shirk its obligations related to the Nile 
River under the very same treaties. 
The situation as it stands today was en-
tirely avoidable. A viable solution has been 
on the table. In 2019, following a decade of 
adamantly rejecting any kind of agreement, 
much less the participation of any mediators 
or observers, Ethiopia finally accepted the 
participation and input of Washington and 
the World Bank in the process. The three 
countries were on the verge of signing an eq-
uitable agreement, a compromise deal in-
spired by the successful model of cooperation 
governing the Senegal River Basin. But at 
the eleventh hour, Ethiopia abruptly backed 
out and claimed that the proposed agree-
ment deprived Ethiopia from its right to 
generate electricity efficiently from the 
GERD or undergo future projects, and that it 
tried to impose water shares to which Ethi-
opia does not subscribe. 
Contrary to Ethiopian claims, this com-
promise deal assured Ethiopia that it will 
generate 
hydropower 
from 
the 
GERD 
sustainably 
at 
optimum 
levels, 
in 
all 
hydrological conditions, while protecting the 
downstream 
countries 
from 
ravaging 
droughts. It unambiguously stipulated that 
it is not a water-allocation agreement, clear-
ly recognized Ethiopia’s right to undertake 
future projects on the Blue Nile in accord-
ance with applicable international law, and 
allowed the parties to revisit the agreement 
in 10 years. 
Today, one year later, negotiations are 
still faltering under the auspices of the Afri-
can Union, and Ethiopia’s statements have 
now disclosed the actual reason it abandoned 
the Washington talks: Ethiopia rejects any 
legally binding agreement on the rules of 
filling and operation of its new dam, de-
manding a framework of nonbinding guide-
lines that it could alter at its whim. This is 
in contradiction with the 2015 Agreement on 
Declaration of Principles among the three 
countries. 
Even though Ethiopia’s political state-
ments speak to its commitment to the Afri-
can Union-led mediation process, invoking 
the shared principle ‘‘African solutions for 
African problems,’’ Ethiopia’s actions clear-
ly undermine, in effect, the role of the Afri-
can Union. This has been evidenced by Ethio-
pia’s categorical rejection, in the most re-
cent meeting in Kinshasa, Democratic Re-
public of the Congo, in April, of multiple 
joint proposals from Sudan and Egypt to em-
power the African Union-led process. That’s 
because Ethiopia prefers a nominal role for 
the chairperson at the African Union rather 
than an active role. 
A new era of stability and shared economic 
prosperity is on the horizon in Africa and the 
Middle East, due in large part to the steady 
leadership of the United States. One example 
of the welcome changes sweeping through 
the region is the recent U.S.-brokered nor-
malization agreements between Israel and a 
number of Arab states, which was reminis-
cent of Egypt’s trailblazing treaty with 
Israel—also mediated by the United States— 
more than 40 years ago. 
Through principled diplomacy, the Biden 
administration can reset the faltering nego-
tiations. The United States has the leverage 
needed to successfully encourage Ethiopia to 
engage in good faith in the GERD negotia-
tions and to refrain from unilateral actions 
and the pursuit of narrow self-interests, 
which have been detrimental to its neigh-
bors’ legitimate interests. Soliciting exper-
tise from international partners, including 
the United Nations, the European Union, and 
the United States, in support of the African 
Union-led mediation process would be in-
valuable in bringing the negotiations to fru-
ition as soon as possible. This proposal would 
also ensure there’s no room to falsely point 
fingers; it would not be feasible to challenge 
the impartiality of all these partners led by 
the chairperson of the African Union, the 
way Ethiopia did with U.S. President Donald 
Trump’s administration after Ethiopia aban-
doned the U.S.-led mediation process last 
year. 
History shows that progress along the Nile 
can be fragile, and a single dispute can have 
harmful ripple effects that destabilize the re-
gion and reach our allies in the West. Failing 
to resolve the rapidly escalating issue over 
the GERD would accelerate the already dev-
astating impacts of climate change in the 
area, unleash a wave of illegal migration to 
the West, and open the door to new conflicts 
and even terrorism in the Middle East and 
East Africa. 
Through principled diplomacy, the Biden 
administration can reset the faltering nego-
tiations, bring about an equitable solution 
for all parties, and, in doing so, ultimately 
safeguard its strategic interests with three 
important regional allies.

HONORING V-J DAY 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the 76th Anniversary of V-J Day on 
August 14th, 2021. I am forever grateful for 
the sacrifices of our service members. 
Victory over Japan Day, V-J Day, marked 
the triumphent end of World War II. This day 
commemorates the announcement of Japan’s 
surrender. This is an event that is important to 
the United States, the state of Oklahoma, and 
the veterans in our community. 
For the past several years, Frank Reisinger 
has helped coordinate a remembrance event 
in Broken Arrow. This is a special occasion 
that allows our community to honor our vet-
erans, especially those who served in World 
War II. 
Frank, a veteran himself, can still recall wit-
nessing the celebrations in downtown Tulsa 
76 years ago. He was an 18-year-old standing 
in his dad’s office overlooking the festivities in 
the streets below. It is this memory that in-
spires him to continue to remember this won-
derful day in American History. 
I am truly grateful for this event and the 
work of Frank Reisinger and the City of Bro-
ken Arrow to honor this day.

resented Winnebago High School and her

pionship, and I join the rest of the community

HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE 
MUNICH 11 
HON. MONDAIRE JONES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, in September 
1972, during the Munich Olympic Games, the 
terrorist group Black September murdered 11 
members of the Israeli Olympic Team. The 
victims became known as the Munich 11. 
Their names were David Berger, Ze’ev Fried-
man, Yoseff Gutfreund, Moshe Weinberg, 
Yoseff Romano, Mark Slavin, Eliezer Halfin, 
Yakov 
Springer, 
Andre 
Spitzer, 
Amitzur 
Shapira, and Kehat Shorr. They were athletes 
and coaches at the 1972 games. May their 
memory be a blessing. 
The international community was deeply af-
fected by the attack, and memorials have 
been placed around the world, from Rockland 
County, New York to Tel Aviv, Israel. The 
Jewish Community Center (JCC) Maccabi 
Games have included a memorial tribute to 
the Munich 11 at the opening ceremonies of 
every JCC Maccabi Games since 1995. When 
the JCC in Rockland County, located in my 
district, hosted the Maccabi Games in 2012, 
the Center decided to take up this cause. 
JCC Rockland created an online petition 
calling on the International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) to hold a minute of silence at the 2012 
London Olympic Games, which was denied. 
But soon, the JCC began to find success. At 
the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, a 
memorial service in honor of the Munich 11 
was held inside the Olympic Village. Further, 
the IOC established that a memorial service in 
their memory will be held at every future 
Olympic Games. 
Starting with the 1976 Montreal Olympic 
Games, Ankie Spitzer, the widow of fencing 
coach Andrei Spitzer, and Ilana Romano, the 
widow of weightlifter Yossef Romano, have 
gone 
to 
nearly 
every Olympic Summer 
Games. They have been leading the effort on 
behalf of the families to memorialize the Mu-
nich 11 at the opening ceremonies for the past 
49 years. 
After tireless advocacy from Ms. Spitzer, 
Ms. Romano, and JCC Rockland, the Munch 
11 finally received a minute of silence during 
the opening ceremony of this year’s Tokyo 
Olympic Games. 
It is my hope that every future Olympic 
Games opening ceremony includes a moment 
of silence to commemorate the gravity of this 
tragic event for all Olympians and humankind. 
The Olympic Games serve to send a message 
of hope and peace through athletic competi-
tion, and reject and repudiate terrorism as 
antithetical to the Olympic spirit.

IN HONOR OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE 
INITIATIVE’S 
COMMUNITY 
RE-
MEMBRANCE PROJECT 
HON. MARK POCAN 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize the installation of a historical 
marker in the Good Hope Missionary Baptist 
Church yard on August 1, 2021, which will 
memorialize the life and death of three Amer-
ican citizens who were lynched in 1908. This 
month my constituent, Ms. Joyce Salter John-
son, will travel with friends and family from 
Wisconsin to Mississippi to honor her relative, 
Frank Johnson, as one of those three men 
who were violently murdered in Hickory, Mis-
sissippi. 
This historical marker is part of the impor-
tant work being done by the Equal Justice Ini-
tiative (EJI) in honoring and memorializing 
lives lost to racial violence in America through 
its campaign, the Community Remembrance 
Project. Since its founding in 1989 by Amer-
ican lawyer and bestselling author Bryan Ste-
venson, EJI has fought to end mass incarcer-
ation and excessive punishment in the United 
States, challenge racial and economic injus-
tice, and protect basic human rights for the 
most vulnerable. EJI has become a critical in-
stitution dedicated to addressing the legacy of 
slavery, 
lynching, 
and 
racial 
segregation 
through its robust projects, museums, and me-
morials. In April 2018, EJI opened America’s 
first national memorial dedicated to victims of 
racial terror in Montgomery, Alabama, inspired 
by the late Dr. James Cameron’s Black Holo-
caust Museum, founded in my home state of 
Wisconsin. 
EJI’s Community Remembrance Project 
partners with community coalitions to do ex-
tensive research of documented victims of ra-
cial violence. Its sister project, the Community 
Soil Collection Project, gathers soil at lynching 
sites for display in powerful exhibits honoring 
these victims. Narrative historical markers are 
then built in public locations where racial terror 
took place. 
My constituent, Joyce Salter Johnson, is a 
historian and author whose third book pro-
vides a thorough history of the Freedmen Set-
tlement of Good Hope, Mississippi, where she 
lived until the age of 10. That is how she knew 
of the terrible sequence of events that led to 
the October 10, 1908 lynching of her relative, 
Mr. Frank Johnson, and two others, Dee 
Dawkins and William Fielder, prior to EJI’s 
documentation. Because of her knowledge 
and adept research ability, she was perfectly 
suited to lead the coalition members working 
on the Community Remembrance Project for 
these men. 
I commend the work of the Equal Justice 
Initiative and all those who help further the 
Community Remembrance Project’s mission of 
confronting the legacy of slavery, lynching, 
and segregation to pave the way toward a bet-
ter, more just future. I extend my heartfelt best 
wishes, thanks, and solidarity to Ms. Johnson 
and her family and friends on their journey of 
remembrance and memorial. 
IN HONOR OF MRS. LINDA NELSON 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the career of my friend and a trusted 
former advisor, Mrs. Linda Nelson, Chairman 
of The Woodlands Area Chamber of Com-
merce. 
A native of New Jersey, Linda moved to the 
Houston, Texas area in 1980. She completed 
her undergraduate degree in Business at West 
Virginia Wesleyan College and went on to re-
ceive her Master’s in Business Administration 
at Texas Women’s University. In 1997, Linda 
moved to The Woodlands and began serving 
as a part-time volunteer coordinator at Memo-
rial Hermann The Woodlands Medical Center. 
Today, Linda serves as the Business Develop-
ment and Regional Marketing Director for Me-
morial Hermann The Woodlands. She and her 
husband, Gordon, have been married for over 
39 years and have three adult children living 
in the Houston and Austin areas. 
Linda is not only a principled business lead-
er, but she is an enthusiastic community lead-
er as well. Her commitment to serving and 
leading in her community is evident through 
her involvement with Leadership Montgomery 
County (LMC), The Conroe/Lake Conroe 
Chamber of Commerce, and the Economic 
Development Partnership. Nelson also spent 
time serving The Woodlands community as 
precinct chair. When she’s not working for the 
committees she serves on or Memorial Her-
mann, 
Nelson 
can 
be 
found 
playing 
racquetball, golfing, fishing, or spending time 
with her family. 
Linda has received many awards recog-
nizing her for her dedicated community serv-
ice, including: Hometown Hero Award, The 
Woodlands Area Chamber Citizen of the Year, 
LMC 
Distinguished 
Alumnus 
Award, 
IRONMAN Captain of the Year, The Wood-
lands Area Chamber Chairman’s Award and 
the Montgomery County Women’s Council on 
Organizations’ Woman of Distinction. Linda is 
a role model and mentor to other women in 
her community. She continuously pulls up a 
seat to the table for the next generation of 
professional women, empowers them to give 
back to their communities and challenges 
them to grow in leadership in their workplaces. 
After over two decades of selfless service to 
our community, I am pleased to join Linda’s 
family and friends in thanking and congratu-
lating her for her servant leadership through 
her time as Chairman of The Woodlands Area 
Chamber of Commerce.

The IHSA Music Sweepstakes is an annual 
competition that judges solo and ensemble 
performances based on tone, technique, per-
formance, creativity and other metrics. The ex-
ceptional performance of the students secured 
Stockton’s first Class C State Championship, 
having already won seven Class D Champion-
ships over the last ten years. It gives me great 
pleasure to see these students thriving in 
school and with their peers despite the chal-
lenges of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
It is because of driven and dedicated indi-
viduals such as these students that I am espe-

HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 13, 2021 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to wish Barbara Proffitt a happy 85th birthday. 
Barbara is a key figure in the Hardin County 
community, who is known for her kindness to 
all she encounters. 
Barbara devotes much of her time serving 
her community. She is the North Hardin High 
School boys’ basketball team’s biggest sup-
porter and ‘‘team mom.’’ With her father, 
brother, and husband all having served in the 
military, Barbara is well connected to the mili-
tary community. She volunteers to pack food 
boxes for soldiers who are deployed and 
bakes her famous pecan pie for each change 
of command at Fort Knox. Barbara is affec-
tionately known on post as ‘‘The Pie Lady.’’ 
For 30 years, Barbara also served the com-
munity through her role as the community/ 
guest relations coordinator at Hardin Memorial 
Hospital, which is now called Baptist Health 
Hardin. In this role, she connected the com-
munity to the hospital through meetings, din-
ners, tours, parades, and special functions. 
Barbara is a proud mother to Rhonda Hun-
ter and Blake Proffitt, grandmother to three 
grandchildren, and great-grandmother to a 
great-grandchild. Happy Birthday Barbara and 
thanks for all that you do for the Hardin Coun-
ty community.

passed away on July 28, 2021. 
Mr. Lovorn was born in Jackson, MS and

er, and author. 
Mr. Lovorn is survived by his wife of 50 
years, their two children and three grand-
