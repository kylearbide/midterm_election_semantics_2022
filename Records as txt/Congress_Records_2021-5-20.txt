PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Loving and eternal God, call us to re-
joice in You always. 
Draw near to us this day that our 
hearts would be inclined toward pa-
tience, and in Your presence, may the 
gentleness that comes from our rela-
tionship with You be evident in us. 
Draw near to us this day that we 
would not be anxious about anything, 
not things past, not things present, nor 
the future before us. 
But in Your presence, may we ap-
proach every situation in prayer and 
petition and with thanksgiving. 
Draw near to us as we present our re-
quests to You, and grant us Your 
peace, which transcends all under-
standing. In Your presence, may Your 
peace guard our hearts and minds. 
Draw near to us so that we can only 
think about what is true, what is 
noble, what is right, what is pure, what 
is lovely, what is admirable. When we 
are in Your presence, may we see that 
all these things are of You, excellent 
and praiseworthy. 
Draw near to us as we proceed in our 
affairs. And in Your presence, may we 
put into practice all that we have 
learned or received or heard in faith. 
God of peace, be with us. And may we 
find joy in Your nearness. 
To You our God and creator, be glory 
forever and ever. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN) come forward and lead the House 
in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. DEAN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
EMPHASIZING IMPORTANCE OF 
TAX CREDITS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to emphasize the impor-
tance of the earned income tax credit 
and the child tax credit for my con-
stituents in my district. Because of the 
severe winter storms earlier this year, 
Texans can still file their tax returns 
until June 15—I repeat, until June 15. 
Single filers who make $75,000 or less 
annually and heads of household who 
earn $112,500 annually could benefit 
from the full earned income tax credit 
and child tax credits if they file their 
taxes on time. 
In 
my 
district 
alone, 
President 
Biden’s new 1-year expansion of the 
child tax credit will lift 213,500 children 
out of poverty. That means that 95 per-
cent of the children in my district 
would benefit. 
Because of this, I am urging all of my 
constituents to file their taxes even if 
they don’t normally do so. Working 
families and children need these dol-
lars now more than ever. 
I am glad that the improved and ex-
panded child tax credit will be arriving 
soon to help families in my district and 
in Texas. 
f 
MODIFYING STOCK VEHICLES FOR 
RACING 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, mo-
torsports are one of America’s favorite 
pastimes and play an important role in 
our economy. 
Pennsylvania’s 
12th 
Congressional 
District is home to Selinsgrove Speed-
way, Clinton County Motor Speedway, 
Port Royal Speedway, Beaver Springs 
Dragway, and thousands of racing fans, 
myself included. Some of my best 
memories are at the raceway, enjoying 
the sights and sounds with our commu-
nity and family. 
That is why I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of the Recognizing 
the Protection of Motorsports Act, or 
the RPM act. Automotive fans have 
long altered stock vehicles for com-
petitive racing, a practice that is as old 
as the sport itself. In 2016, the Environ-
mental Protection Agency issued a pro-
posed rule that would make modifying 
stock vehicles for racing illegal. The

RPM Act would ensure that this 
doesn’t 
happen, 
permanently 
pro-
tecting this practice. 
The racing industry has a rich his-
tory, and I believe it should be pro-
tected from burdensome regulatory 
barriers. 
f 
CALLING FOR SWIFT CEASE-FIRE 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, the 
violence that is unfolding in Palestine 
and Israel is tragic and urgent. I rise 
today to voice my strong support for a 
swift cease-fire. 
I have heard directly from my con-
stituents in New York’s 16th Congres-
sional District. Parents with children 
living in both Israel and Palestine have 
written in, and their fear for their chil-
dren’s safety is palpable. 
Their voices are with me today and 
have made this situation personal. This 
is the worst escalation of violence in 
the region in years. 
I have continually called for Presi-
dent Biden to step in and rapidly 
broker a cease-fire to deescalate the 
situation, end the occupation, and fi-
nally find peace. 
To that end, I will introduce a resolu-
tion calling for an immediate cease-fire 
and diplomatic efforts to resume in 
earnest, which is a resolution Senator 
SANDERS has led in the Senate. We 
have to do more. We must do more. 
f 
SUPPORTING ISRAEL OVER HAMAS 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
deliver a clear message: The United 
States must stand shoulder to shoulder 
with the State of Israel. The choice for 
the politicians in this Chamber should 
be simple. 
On one side, you have Hamas, a ter-
rorist organization that fired thou-
sands of rockets at civilians in Israel. 
Their founding charter even calls for 
Israel’s destruction. 
On the other side, you have Israel, 
the only democracy in the Middle East. 
They are our longtime friend and ally, 
and they are a force for stability in the 
region. 
The deescalation of this conflict 
should begin and end with Hamas. 
They must stop their terrorist attacks 
on Israeli citizens immediately. 
Until they do, Israel has every right 
to defend themselves, and the United 
States of America should have their 
back. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DENISE 
BURSTEIN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor my con-
stituent and friend, Denise Burstein. 
Denise passed away on May 13 due to 
complications related to ALS. 
She was a loving wife, mother, grand-
mother, and community leader. She 
was a woman of diverse passions and 
talent, an avid knitter, quilter, radio 
operator, and I recently learned that 
she had a black belt in karate. 
She devoted her life to helping oth-
ers, working as a school speech and 
language therapist and continuing to 
help children even after her retire-
ment. 
She was first to volunteer, whether it 
was as a local committeeperson with 
the Boy Scouts, coaching, training 
therapy dogs, or, after her diagnosis, 
helping spread awareness of ALS. 
To know Denise is to know her hus-
band, Frank. They are two parts of a 
single smile, wonderful hosts whose 
brunches are the places to be for 
friendship, politics, and delicious food. 
I join Denise’s family, friends, and 
wider community in mourning the loss 
of an incredible woman. I am better for 
having known her. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HANK 
HUCKABY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Hank 
Huckaby, who passed away on April 14 
at the age of 79. 
Hank was a lifelong public servant 
who served the State of Georgia in nu-
merous capacities for more than 50 
years. He held a number of top roles in 
Georgia government and education, in-
cluding chancellor of Georgia’s public 
colleges and universities, executive di-
rector of the Georgia Housing and Fi-
nance Authority, director of the Office 
of Planning and Budget, and in the 
Georgia House of Representatives. 
Put simply, Hank was devoted to 
serving the people of Georgia. His pub-
lic service extended out of the work-
place, volunteering his time and lead-
ership in various civic and religious or-
ganizations throughout his life. 
Madam Speaker, Hank Huckaby was 
a graduate of Young Harris College, 
and I had the privilege of serving with 
him on the board of trustees of Young 
Harris College. He loved Young Harris 
College, and Young Harris College 
loved him. 
Hank was a strong leader, a source of 
strength, and a true friend to all who 
knew him. He will be greatly missed. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
SENATE MUST SUPPORT 
COMMISSION ON JANUARY 6 SIEGE 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the bipartisan na-
tional commission to investigate the 
January 6 siege on the Capitol. 
I was in this Chamber that day. I 
took cover in the gallery as police 
barred the door and drew their guns. I 
escaped with my colleagues to watch 
from a secure location to watch the 
last vestiges of the attack play out. I 
was proud to return to this Chamber 
that night to complete our constitu-
tional duty. 
The events that transpired on Janu-
ary 6 on these grounds were not just an 
attack on the building and the people 
who work here. It was an effort to un-
dermine our democracy and steal an 
election. 
The immediate threat to the Capitol 
was repelled, but the threat to our de-
mocracy remains. Every American who 
believes our Constitution is the bed-
rock of our Nation should demand this 
commission, demand that we under-
stand what conditions led up to and en-
abled the January 6 insurrection, and 
ensure that nothing like it happens 
again. 
It is now up to the Senate to pass the 
bill for the good of our country. If not, 
the House must be prepared to proceed 
on its own. 
f 
HONORING RICH O’BRIEN 
(Ms. MACE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to speak on behalf of a great Amer-
ican and constituent of mine, Rich 
O’Brien. 
Rich’s story is one that inspires hope. 
He is the operations manager for PGA 
HOPE Charleston. PGA HOPE stands 
for Helping Our Patriots Everywhere, 
and it is the PGA’s flagship program to 
do military outreach. 
As one of the leaders of the golf ther-
apy movement, he is a testament to 
hope. Madam Speaker, 121⁄2 years ago, 
he was on his deathbed, paralyzed from 
the neck down after a catastrophic in-
jury where he broke his back, his neck, 
and had four skull fracture injuries and 
brain damage in every lobe. Rich died 
three times at the scene of the accident 
before an EMT was able to revive him 
and eventually place him into an in-
duced coma. 
He was lucky, though, and eventually 
regained feeling in his fingers and toes 
and learned to walk and talk again. He 
was able to use golf therapy to reha-
bilitate his injuries. 
Following his own recovery, he start-
ed helping others to use golf therapy 
and became an advocate for others 
with disabilities. As Charleston wel-
comes the PGA Championship this 
weekend, Rich deserves applause and 
praise for his charity and willingness 
to 
help 
other 
veterans 
like 
him 
through golf therapy.

May 20, 2021 
STAND WITH ISRAEL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, over the last few 
days, well more than 3,000 rockets have 
been fired into Israel by Hamas. This 
comes as no surprise, given that the 
Hamas charter written in 1988 includes 
36 articles all explicitly dedicated to 
the destruction of Israel. 
As a sovereign nation, Israel has 
every right to defend its borders, com-
munities, and citizens. The Biden ad-
ministration has prioritized the nu-
clear deal with Iran instead of making 
a full commitment to continue our ro-
bust support for our most important 
ally in the Middle East, Israel. 
Iran is the leading state sponsor of 
terrorism and Iran’s Supreme Leader, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted that 
Palestinians must ‘‘stand strong’’ and 
‘‘confront the enemy’’ shortly before 
Tel Aviv was targeted by rocket fire. 
Madam Speaker, many Democrats 
will not condemn the ceaseless attacks 
against the Israeli people. Republicans 
are committed to ensuring that the 
United States fully upholds its com-
mitments to Israel and continues to 
support the programs which have saved 
thousands of lives from destruction by 
Iran, 
Hamas, 
and 
other 
terrorist 
groups.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emergency 
Security Supplemental to Respond to Janu-
ary 6th Appropriations Act, 2021’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER) each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Emergency Security Supplemental 
to Respond to January 6th Appropria-
tions Act. 
Like many of us in the Capitol com-
munity, I am still shaken by the vio-
lence and terror of that day and the 
tragedies in its aftermath: the death of 
Officer Brian Sicknick, the Good Fri-
day attack that killed Officer Billy 
Evans, and the emotional trauma that 
has led to the deaths of Officer Howie 
Liebengood and Metropolitan Police 
Department Officer Jeffrey Smith by 
suicide. 
Congress owes it to every single per-
son who works in or visits the United 
States Capitol to provide funding to re-
cover, rebuild, and keep all who serve 
in the legislative branch safe, healthy, 
and secure. 
The Appropriations Committee has 
acted very carefully to construct this 
package. We conducted a bipartisan 
briefing in January, discussed the issue 
at 
12 
subcommittee 
hearings, 
and 
closely reviewed the recommendations 
of Task Force 1–6 Capitol Security Re-
view, led by Lieutenant General Russel 
Honore and comprised of senior, retired 
law enforcement officials and military 
leaders. We have also heard from in-
spectors general and consulted security 
experts in and out of government. 
This bill is narrowly tailored to re-
spond to January 6 and to protect the 
Capitol going forward. It contains $1.9 
billion in emergency funding to reim-
burse the National Guard and District 
of Columbia for their response; provide 
the Capitol Police with overtime pay, 
retention bonuses, equipment replace-
ment, and wellness and trauma sup-
port; ensures the Department of Jus-
tice can prosecute every person who at-
tacked law enforcement and ransacked 
this building; provides bonuses and 
help to custodial staff; and it renames 
the Capitol Police Wellness Center in 
the 
memory 
of 
Officer 
Howie 
Liebengood. 
As recommended by the Capitol Se-
curity Review, this legislation protects 
the Capitol by providing resources to 
harden windows and doors; construct 
security screening vestibules; install 
new cameras; and provide specialized 
training, riot control equipment, and 
body cameras for the Capitol Police. 
To augment the Capitol Police, the 
legislation establishes and funds a 
dedicated quick reaction force of Na-
tional Guard personnel, another rec-
ommendation of the Capitol Security 
Review. 
This legislation also bolsters security 
for Members of Congress, with dedi-
cated funding for enhanced security 
and threat assessments, coordinated 
Member travel security, and upgrades 
to security in district offices. 
It has, most importantly, won the en-
dorsement of the Capitol Police, to 
meet its evolving mission, and Lieu-
tenant General Honore urged Congress 
to pass this funding. 
We all sit in this Chamber, and we 
lived with the violent assault on our 
democracy and our lives. We must act 
now to fulfill our obligations and also 
our oath of office. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) 
will now control the time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 3237, a bill to provide funding 
for Capitol security and other pur-
poses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2622 
May 20, 2021 
Unfortunately, after several weeks of 
discussion, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have chosen a path of 
partisanship instead of working to-
gether. I want to explain how we ended 
up in this situation. 
In January, the Speaker of the House 
directed a retired lieutenant general 
and his team to review security needs 
on the House side of the Capitol fol-
lowing the events of January 6. This 
review was directed without even con-
sulting House Republicans or the Sen-
ate. 
Even though the review by General 
Honore began as a partisan effort, 
members of the Appropriations Com-
mittee hoped things could get back on 
track and we could negotiate a funding 
agreement that could be supported by 
both parties in both Chambers. 
That is why it is so disappointing 
that we are now left with the bill be-
fore us. This is a one-sided solution 
that does not even have buy-in from 
Democrats in the Senate. 
The bill we are considering today im-
plements permanent recommendations 
before ongoing security assessments 
are complete; it creates a multi-mil-
lion-dollar fund for future expenses at 
the Capitol prior to knowing what is 
really needed; and it delays much-need-
ed reimbursements for agencies that 
have protected the Capitol since Janu-
ary 6, such as the National Guard and 
the Capitol Police. 
It also provides $200 million to estab-
lish a force within the D.C. National 
Guard to respond to incidents at the 
Capitol, raising serious concerns about 
the role of our military on American 
soil. 
Some of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have also raised con-
cerns about using the National Guard 
in this way. 
The chairman of the Senate Appro-
priations Committee, Senator LEAHY, 
has said that it is important for the 
Capitol to remain open and accessible 
to the public and not feel like a milita-
rized zone. I agree with him. 
Matters of such importance like this 
should be handled in the proper way, 
marked up in the Appropriations Com-
mittee and authorizing committees so 
that Members’ positions can be fully 
considered. 
At the very least, amendments to 
this bill should have been allowed on 
the House floor today. Unfortunately, 
Members on both sides of the aisle have 
been shut out. 
Madam Speaker, the events of Janu-
ary 6 were tragic and exposed serious 
security 
vulnerabilities 
around 
the 
Capitol complex, as well as an inability 
to properly respond and act when intel-
ligence is provided. 
Congress must prevent anything like 
this from ever happening again, but the 
bill before us today is not the solution. 
There is no reason why we cannot 
continue discussing in good faith and 
reach a bipartisan compromise. 
For this reason, I must urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this package. I 
hope we can get back to the negoti-
ating table soon. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD), 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Homeland Security. 
Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like to speak briefly 
to the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s portion of the supplemental, 
which includes $6.8 million. 
The direct role of the Department of 
Homeland Security on January 6 was 
limited to the protection of Vice Presi-
dent PENCE and Vice President-elect 
HARRIS. 
The Secret Service, like almost every 
other Federal agency, was insuffi-
ciently aware of open-source informa-
tion that made clear the severity of the 
security threat on that day, and it 
failed to take seriously the threat in-
formation it was aware of. 
Through discussions with the Secret 
Service, we identified $6.8 million in 
funding requirements to address secu-
rity deficiencies that were exposed on 
January 6, generally related to the pro-
tection of the White House complex 
and open-source intelligence collection 
and analysis. 
The total includes $2 million to reim-
burse the Secret Service for temporary 
anti-scale fencing used to expand the 
White House security perimeter beyond 
the permanent White House fence ear-
lier this year. 
It included temporary fencing around 
Blair House while Vice President Har-
ris resided there during needed repairs 
to the official Vice Presidential resi-
dence. 
This fencing was required by the 
heightened security posture associated 
with the Presidential transition. 
These costs were unanticipated, be-
cause the Secret Service is unable to 
budget for a Presidential transition fol-
lowing a sitting President’s first term 
in office. 
The fiscal year 2021 funding bill for 
the Department of Homeland Security 
provided $43 million above the request 
to help cover some of the Presidential 
transition costs, but the Secret Service 
has had to absorb other costs, totaling 
more than $35 million. So this is a very 
modest but much-needed reimburse-
ment. 
The total also includes $3.2 million 
for less lethal equipment, civil disturb-
ance unit training and vehicles, and 
the establishment of a new civil dis-
turbance unit class to help the Secret 
Service improve its ability to appro-
priately respond to civil unrest. 
Finally, the total includes $1.6 mil-
lion to enhance the Secret Service’s 
open-source intelligence analysis capa-
bility. 
This is intended to help fill the gaps 
that led to a failure to identify the 
January 6 insurrectionists as a serious 
threat, based on open-source informa-
tion available prior to that date. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
the 
Legislative 
Branch. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Sup-
plemental to Respond to January 6th 
Appropriations Act. 
There is broad bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement that a security supple-
mental is necessary. I believe that. 
The committee was actively negoti-
ating towards legislation that could 
have come to the floor in that spirit. 
However, the majority jumped to the 
gate early, which leaves us with a near-
ly $2 billion bill with too many unre-
solved issues. 
Agencies across six subcommittees 
need to be reimbursed for the events 
that occurred in responding to the Cap-
itol on January 6. We agree. Repairs 
have to be done. Support for the Cap-
itol Police must be provided. 
But we do not need to make pre-
mature decisions before the ongoing se-
curity assessments are complete, to 
commit funding that goes well beyond 
the scope of January 6, or authorize 
programs without any debate. 
The assessment that was done by 
General Honore only looked at the 
House side of the Capitol. That is part 
of the challenge, is we are funding 
something that is incomplete. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Washington. 
b 0930 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, we would be better served by 
holding this until the Architect of the 
Capitol completes their comprehensive 
assessment on both sides of the Capitol 
complex and the entire grounds before 
allocating significant sums of money. 
This amounts to the kind of slush fund 
creation that heightens Americans’ 
distrust of Congress, and we certainly 
do not need to militarize the Capitol to 
keep our Members and staff safe. We 
can do better. 
The unilateral move by the majority 
will only delay much-needed reim-
bursements for the agencies that pro-
tect the Capitol. We need to reignite 
the bipartisan discussions, and we need 
to do it soon. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I respectfully say to the gentle-
woman from Washington State that 
the situation we face is dire. The Cap-
itol Police do not have the equipment 
they need to secure the Capitol, and 
other security vulnerabilities have not 
been resolved.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2623 
May 20, 2021 
Also, the Capitol Police force is reel-
ing as January 6, the deaths of Officers 
Liebengood and Evans, overtime, and 
other issues continue to take a toll on 
officers’ mental health. We cannot wait 
until the report of a commission. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), 
the chairman of the Legislative Branch 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, let me 
just say we had a vote here yesterday 
to create a commission, a bipartisan 
commission, to go through all of these 
initiatives in a bipartisan way, and it 
was rejected by the vast majority of 
those on the other side. 
We are trying to do this in a bipar-
tisan way. It is what the American peo-
ple want. It is what the American peo-
ple deserve. This bill here is largely 
based on the recommendations from 
General Honore, who went to great 
lengths with four or five or six other 
generals to analyze what happened on 
January 6 and provide us with rec-
ommendations. 
The time is now. We have to act. We 
hear about the rank-and-file police of-
ficers here who have 12-hour shifts, 16- 
hour shifts, don’t have the equipment 
that they need, securing of the Capitol, 
the trauma that happened here. None 
of us are going to forget those events. 
But this is a narrowly tailored bill to 
provide long overdue support. Here we 
are, working ourselves into the end of 
May. This is support for direct costs in-
curred by the attack on the Capitol 
and to restore the faith that Members 
of Congress can safely carry out our 
constitutional duties. 
It demonstrates a strong commit-
ment to continue to allow Americans 
from across the country to be able to 
come to the Capitol. We are not milita-
rizing the Capitol. We are going to 
have a quick response force in case 
something happens similar to if there 
was a threat to the President, a threat 
to Washington, D.C., we start flying 
fighter jets overhead. This is the equiv-
alent. We are not trying to militarize 
anything. 
There is critical support in here for 
the Capitol Police to maintain the cur-
rent workforce until we can hire and 
recruit more officers, such as back-
filling overtime, hazard pay, and tui-
tion credits, so we don’t lose more of 
the Capitol Police to other agencies. 
The bill includes $3.3 million for the 
Capitol Police’s intelligence division, 
which was a huge part of the failures 
that occurred on January 6. So we 
want to invest and make sure that we 
have the intelligence capabilities that 
we need. 
We want to make sure that the Cap-
itol Police have all the equipment that 
they need, as the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut just said, gas masks, tac-
tical vests, body armor. 
I am proud of this bill, and I am 
proud this bill supports the emotional 
needs of Members of Congress, congres-
sional employees, and the Capitol Po-
lice, with funding for both the Office of 
Employee Assistance and the Capitol 
Police wellness program. 
This emergency supplemental appro-
priation renames the Capitol Police 
wellness 
program 
the 
Howard 
C. 
‘‘Howie’’ 
Liebengood 
Center 
for 
Wellness. The bill provides funding for 
six new Capitol Police mental health 
counselors and wellness resilience spe-
cialists. This is an extremely necessary 
investment in our workforce, and it 
will help them grow and heal from the 
events of January 6 and the sad day of 
Good Friday. 
I am also pleased that this bill estab-
lishes funds for future Capitol Grounds 
security. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. It also establishes funds 
for future Capitol Grounds security, in-
cluding upgrades to windows, doors, se-
curity screening vestibules, and the in-
stallation of new cameras around the 
Capitol Building and House Office 
Buildings. 
It includes $350,000 for hazard pay to 
the custodial staff that were working 
on the campus on January 6 and helped 
in the aftermath to get things cleaned 
up so we could continue our business. 
The employees have received the Ar-
chitect’s Exceptional Service Award 
and are recognized as valuable mem-
bers of the Capitol community. 
We have had many tough conversa-
tions with our colleagues, in looking at 
the Capitol security review and rec-
ommendations from General Honore. 
We also include $21 million to address 
Member security while traveling and in 
district offices. 
We are living in a new reality. To ad-
dress providing a safe and healthy com-
munity, we have included funding to 
reimburse and further support our leg-
islative branch agencies in response to 
the coronavirus: Telework, sanitizing, 
cleaning our Capitol complex and dis-
trict offices. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud of the 
hard work of so many. I thank the gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut for being a 
force to get this bill done. This supple-
mental needs to pass. We need to act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. We have to act. If the 
American people can’t see us acting in 
a bipartisan way when a group of peo-
ple storm the Capitol, and we can’t 
even pass a bill with Republican sup-
port to fix the doors and windows and 
provide more police officers, how are 
we going to do anything else? 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. 
Please vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Washington State will 
now control the time in opposition. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have the upmost 
respect both for the chair of the full 
committee and the subcommittee, and 
I have really enjoyed working with him 
on this. 
I couldn’t agree more with a lot of 
what was said, that we need to act, and 
we need to do it. I have demonstrated 
with my actions that I am willing to 
support a bipartisan commission. I 
have been willing to hold accountable 
people who I see in positions of leader-
ship. 
I think my biggest challenge is that 
General Honore did a one-sided review 
of the Capitol. If you read his review, 
his number one requirement for all of 
this to work was the Capitol Police 
Board 
needs 
to 
be 
completely 
rejiggered. I don’t know if he said 
‘‘wiped out.’’ I am using my own term 
here. But it doesn’t work. 
In order for the gear that the Capitol 
Police need to work, they need to have 
training. In order for them to have 
training, they need to have leadership. 
In order for them to have leadership, 
they need to have a board that gives 
their chief some authority. We all 
know that is a problem. 
Can I ask the chair of the full com-
mittee, does this bill, in any way, re-
form the Capitol Police Board? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to respond to the gentlewoman 
from Washington State, but, quite 
frankly, that is an issue that falls 
within the jurisdiction of the House 
Administration Committee. The chair 
is ZOE LOFGREN. It is my understanding 
that Chairman LOFGREN is, in fact, ad-
dressing that issue. 
I concur that we have to deal with 
the issue of the Capitol board, but it 
does not fall within the jurisdiction of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her response. I 
would just add that we are stepping 
ahead of that reform by fully funding 
those requests, and I think that is 
where I am having some challenges. I 
am there. We are going to do this. I 
just think that putting funds in place 
to this tune of close to $2 billion, we 
need to know what we are going to 
spend that money on. We need to know 
that we got those reforms in place. I 
don’t want to throw money at a situa-
tion unless we are going to reform it. 
Part of the problem we saw on Janu-
ary 6 was the communications infra-
structure. Certainly the gear. We have 
to deal with that. But it was so much 
more than that. It was the leadership. 
It was the leadership here. Certainly 
there was political leadership involved. 
I have spoken to that personally. That 
is part of the problem here. That is 
part of the problem with this bill, is we 
are putting the money there, but we 
are not reforming the system. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WOMACK).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2624 
May 20, 2021 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, be-
fore I get to my prepared remarks, let 
me just respond to my friend from 
Ohio. When he speaks, he makes it 
sound like that what went on here yes-
terday on the vote on the 1/6 commis-
sion was not bipartisan. 
Let me remind the gentleman that 
the work of JOHN KATKO on our side 
and BENNIE THOMPSON on the Demo-
cratic side was absolutely bipartisan. 
There was a give-and-take for both 
sides. When the final vote was taken 
yesterday, yes, there were only 35 Re-
publican votes, but I think that would 
qualify as a bipartisan vote yesterday. 
So to categorically suggest to the peo-
ple who might be listening or watching 
today that that was one-sided is cer-
tainly inaccurate. 
I agree with my friend from Wash-
ington that we need a better idea of 
how we are going to spend money be-
fore we do what Washington always 
does, and that is just throw a lot of 
money at the problem. So, naturally, I 
rise in opposition to this partisan secu-
rity supplemental. It is certainly not 
bipartisan in its workup because there 
hasn’t been any negotiation, as we saw 
with Mr. THOMPSON and Mr. KATKO yes-
terday. 
This is just my opinion, but I believe 
that one of the biggest failures that led 
to what happened on 1/6 was a failure 
to act on intelligence that we knew. I 
supported that bipartisan commission 
because I want to see the intelligence. 
I want to see what was being said by all 
of our experts in the run-up to 1/6. I 
think part of the problem on January 6 
was the fact that we did not act on in-
telligence that we knew. 
If the National Guard was needed, 
there is a protocol in place to activate 
the National Guard. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. WOMACK. So I object to the cre-
ation of a quick reaction force, a $200 
million expense to bring the National 
Guard into the picture. There is a pro-
tocol in place. We ought to exercise it. 
The way you do it is you act on intel-
ligence. 
I also oppose creating the $250 mil-
lion slush fund for future unknown 
costs. Let’s understand what our secu-
rity needs are before we throw a bunch 
of money at the problem. 
It also includes funding for the judi-
ciary and the District of Columbia that 
is unrelated to the January 6 attacks. 
The security of our Federal courts is 
extremely important, but that can be 
addressed through the regular appro-
priations process. We ought to do that. 
Finally, I am disappointed the bill 
was not marked up by the Appropria-
tions Committee and that the majority 
has prohibited amendments to improve 
the bill. 
Madam Speaker, it is not going to 
surprise you or anybody else that I am 
not a big fan of this bill. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. Let’s go back to the drawing 
board. Let’s bring some sanity back to 
this process. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to remind the gentleman 
that the last time a supplemental bill 
was brought before the Appropriations 
Committee was in 2009, under the direc-
tion of Chairman David Obey. 
I also want to make a point that it 
did take an inordinate amount of time 
for reinforcements to come and assist 
the overrun Capitol Police. To have 
that not happen again, the Capitol se-
curity review, General Honore rec-
ommended a dedicated force ready to 
respond to any incident, just as we 
have the D.C. Air National Guard, 
which has a mission to protect the re-
gion’s airspace. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE), the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chair of the full Appropria-
tions Committee, who has done an in-
credible job pulling all of these chal-
lenging issues together and putting 
this funding bill on the floor today. 
The activities of January 6 were ter-
rifying, whether you were sitting here 
in this Chamber or whether you were 
watching from anywhere around this 
country or around the world, viewing a 
violent assault on our democracy. 
Thanks to the work of the Capitol 
Police and others in law enforcement, 
the loss of lives was so much less than 
they could have been. But as we all 
know, very tragically there were losses 
of life in our Capitol Police. Our police 
were brutally beaten, and we could 
watch it all happen. 
That is why I rise today in support of 
this emergency security supplemental 
appropriations bill. The bill is the 
product of months of careful and delib-
erate analysis of the resource needs to 
enhance the security at the Capitol. 
I am privileged to be the chair of the 
Appropriations Committee’s Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. I strongly support the 
funding this bill would provide to the 
National Park Service. Large-scale 
special events and demonstrations are 
a common occurrence in the District of 
Columbia, and they often move from 
the National Mall to the Capitol com-
plex. U.S. Park Police and Capitol Po-
lice work closely to share information 
and law enforcement resources to han-
dle these events. 
b 0945 
The funds provided in this bill would 
be used to backfill the Park Service’s 
resources that were unexpectedly de-
pleted during the January 6 attack and 
to prepare the agency for possible fu-
ture threats. 
I believe that it is critical that Con-
gress provide sufficient resources to 
meet the security challenges, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS), the ranking member of the 
Committee on House Administration. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend for yielding. 
This is one of the most disappointing 
days that I have had when it comes to 
figuring out a way to protect this Cap-
itol complex. One of the most dis-
appointing parts of this legislation is 
that both parties for both sides of the 
Capitol were working together on a 
bill, and out of nowhere, House Demo-
crats stopped negotiating and decided 
on Friday to introduce their own par-
tisan bill and rush it to the floor. 
The press has even pointed out that 
the Senate will have to renegotiate 
this bill before it can pass, so I can’t 
help but wonder why we are voting on 
this bill today when we could be voting 
on a deal that actually has a chance of 
becoming law. 
Even worse, this bill is being sold as 
an appropriations bill, but there is a 
lot of legislating happening here—per-
manent security changes buried in this 
nearly $2 billion supplemental bill. As 
ranking member of the House Adminis-
tration Committee, I can tell you that 
some of these permanent changes are 
within my committee’s jurisdiction, 
and my committee hasn’t held any 
hearings to review or examine these 
changes. 
While I believe we need to make the 
National Guard whole for their service 
after January 6, this bill permanently 
establishes the National Guard as a 
quick reaction force. This was just one 
of the options provided in General 
Honore’s report, but if I recall, he pro-
vided three options to establish a quick 
reaction force. I have some serious con-
cerns about this being the most effi-
cient and effective way to protect the 
Capitol in an emergency. 
The bill also requires body cameras 
for each Capitol Police officer, with the 
exception of officers who are on protec-
tive detail for leadership and other 
Members. My committee has not re-
viewed this or why an exception was 
made for certain officers. 
Additionally, this bill could allow 
Members to use taxpayer dollars to 
make upgrades to their homes for secu-
rity purposes. As someone who has 
been shot at on a ballfield and received 
many threats from constituents and 
others over the years, I understand the 
need for protection, and there have al-
ready been changes to help increase 
safety. But I have a feeling some of our 
constituents wouldn’t be happy with 
Members of Congress being able to use 
tax dollars to make improvements that 
could increase the value of their homes 
in the name of security. 
I am disappointed with the process, 
Madam Speaker, and it is a shame we 
are not voting on a bipartisan bill that 
can make it through the Senate. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2625 
May 20, 2021 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), the chairman of 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Subcommittee. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, the 
January 6 attack obviously revealed 
the flaws in security of the Capitol. 
Subsequent attacks on the Capitol 
complex have provided further stark 
evidence of the need to improve the 
physical security of the complex and 
other Federal buildings. 
This supplemental provides the vital, 
urgently needed funding for security 
within the jurisdiction of the Financial 
Services and General Government Sub-
committee. 
In this Chamber, I remember one of 
my colleagues asking when the cavalry 
would arrive. The closest thing to the 
cavalry arriving was the D.C. Metro-
politan Police Department. 
The courage and dedication of the 
MPD in defending the Members, the 
Capitol, and our democracy, saved lives 
and helped this Congress return to 
business more quickly. 
This bill includes funding to reim-
burse MPD for the costs associated 
with the events of the 6th, as well as 
other costs they have incurred due to 
the Federal presence in the District be-
cause we cannot allow the District of 
Columbia to shoulder the burden of de-
fending Congress on their own. 
In the aftermath of the events of the 
6th, all Federal buildings and employ-
ees face additional increased security 
threats. This bill provides funding for 
additional security expenses for Fed-
eral judges and Federal court facilities, 
including security upgrades to exterior 
perimeter security camera systems at 
priority Federal courthouses. 
This bill also includes General Serv-
ices Administration buildings. 
We must provide funding to conduct 
security assessments of Federal build-
ings, including blast mitigation and 
collapse studies, taking the first steps 
in being able to address security vul-
nerabilities. 
No one should have to go to work 
afraid for their safety, none more so 
than our public servants. We must pro-
tect our democratic institutions, Con-
gress, the courts, and all Federal agen-
cies, so no elected official or public 
servant ever goes to work scared to 
execute their duty. 
These threats are real, they are hap-
pening now, and lives are at stake. We 
cannot wait and must move quickly to 
pass this bill. 
For those who would vote against the 
commission, or did, for those who 
would deny there was an insurrection, 
for those who would vote against this 
bill to protect us, you embody the new 
twisted world. 
We grew up believing the phrase, ‘‘I 
will believe it when I see it.’’ You em-
body the phrase, ‘‘I will see it when I 
believe it.’’ God help us. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. 
GOODEN 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
bill. 
This partisan proposal would allocate 
over $2 billion of taxpayer resources for 
a wall around the U.S. Capitol and 
spend money on other things, like 
Members’ personal security at home. 
I don’t believe the American people 
support that. I don’t believe they un-
derstand what is in this bill. And I be-
lieve this bill would only serve to fur-
ther separate the American people 
from their elected representatives here 
in Washington. 
This is not the way we do business in 
the United States of America. It is not 
the way we should do business. 
There are so many issues that are 
more worthy of our attention. The cri-
sis at our border is unlike anything we 
have ever seen. We are recording 20- 
year highs in border crossings. But in-
stead of completing the wall at our 
southern border, which would protect 
innocent children from being exploited 
by human traffickers and drug cartels, 
Democrats would rather spend $2 bil-
lion on a wall around this building in 
D.C. 
This is the people’s House, Madam 
Speaker, and I cannot support this pro-
posal to take my constituents’ hard- 
earned money and use it to keep them 
out. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the 
chairperson of the Committee on House 
Administration. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the bill. It provides 
funding to respond to the January 6 at-
tack, during which violent insurrec-
tionists, incited and encouraged by the 
former President, attacked this Capitol 
where we stand today. 
Since the attack, the Committee on 
House Administration, assisted by Gen-
eral Honore, has reviewed Capitol secu-
rity and has been examining the Cap-
itol Police’s preparation for and re-
sponse to the attack. 
The supplemental narrowly tailors a 
response to that attack. It makes sure 
that we have the physical improve-
ments we know will need to be taken, 
and it supports the Capitol Police with 
wellness and trauma support and pro-
vides officers with the training and riot 
control equipment they should have 
had on the 6th. 
For those who say we should not do 
anything today, it is a mistake to say 
if we can’t do everything at the same 
time, we should do nothing. 
This bill is a first step toward having 
a more secure facility that lodges the 
legislative 
branch 
of 
government. 
There are measures that we sent to the 
House Administration Committee for 
further review. I welcome that. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. I yield the gentle-
woman from California an additional 30 
seconds. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, to 
fail to act today is really to turn your 
backs on the men and women who 
fought as Capitol Police officers just 
yards from where we stand today. They 
were maimed. Their eyes were gouged. 
They lost fingers. Some of them died. 
Don’t turn your backs on them and 
vote against this bill. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I agree with a lot of the gentle-
woman’s sentiment that there is no 
question we must support the men and 
women of the Capitol Police. We must 
provide them the equipment, the train-
ing, and, most importantly, the leader-
ship that supports their efforts. 
Can I ask why you have not put to-
gether legislation to reform the police 
board if it is so all-important that we 
do so? It has been 5 months since Janu-
ary 6. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), the chair of the Committee on 
House Administration, for the purpose 
of answering a question. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we 
had a hearing yesterday that went for 
more than 3 hours. We are likely to 
have additional hearings on that mat-
ter. It is not clear at the moment 
whether the board needs to be replaced, 
whether it was failings of the struc-
ture, or whether it was failings of the 
individuals holding the positions in 
that structure. 
If I may, we will come forward with 
our best analysis of what changes 
should be made in the weeks to come. 
Meanwhile, these officers need our 
support today. We can’t hold back and 
do nothing. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Reclaim-
ing my time, Madam Speaker, I think 
one of my challenges is it has been 5 
months, and I myself have sat in meet-
ings with the Senate Acting Sergeant 
of Arms, with police officers, with the 
police union. I have talked with the po-
lice union president. I have talked with 
individuals who were there on January 
6. I have put together my own timeline 
of these events. And to say that, 5 
months later, we are going to put the 
money before the actual reform to me 
says there is a dereliction of duty from 
the House Administration Committee. 
I mean, how many hearings have 
taken place on January 6 in House Ad-
ministration before today? You are 
telling me there was a meeting yester-
day? 
That is absolutely unacceptable that 
we are going to stand here today and 
say that we have to do this, Madam 
Speaker. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
would take exception to that. The 
House Administration Committee has 
had more oversight and more hearings, 
both at a Member level and a staff 
level, than any other committee in the 
House or Senate about the Capitol Po-
lice. 
We don’t have jurisdiction over ev-
erything, but we have not been derelict 
in our duty. And I take exception on 
the part of the whole committee, Re-
publicans and Democrats, and their 
staff.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2626 
May 20, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Reclaim-
ing my time, Madam Speaker, I am 100 
percent in agreement that we must put 
the funding behind the men and women 
who stand between us and violence, not 
a question. I am there. 
What frustrates me is that I am 
being told that if I don’t vote for this 
today, somehow I am not standing be-
hind our men and women in blue when 
the House Administration Committee 
should have led the way with the 
Honore report. It was put out months 
ago. They could have put these reforms 
in place, could have told us how this 
money would be spent. But they didn’t. 
Why? 
And then they say it is not bipartisan 
unless we do what they want? I am 
sorry, but this isn’t my money. These 
are taxpayer dollars, and I want to 
make sure that we are not just saying 
we spent the money and we are not re-
forming the system. 
For this to never happen again, those 
reforms need to be in place. 
To me, it is a missed opportunity, 
and I will not stand here, Madam 
Speaker, to have it laid at our feet to 
say somehow we are not supporting the 
men and women in blue. I will not 
abide by that charge. 
I believe if that is the truth, then we 
need to make sure that we are all doing 
our work in getting the reforms in 
place so that the money can follow. 
That is how this whole place is de-
signed to work. It is in the Constitu-
tion. That is what we are supposed to 
do. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
would hope the gentlewoman from 
Washington State would put her frus-
tration aside—we all get frustrated in 
this body by so many things—and vote 
to support the folks who took care of 
us that day to deal with their backpay 
and a variety of other issues that were 
important. 
Ms. 
LOFGREN. 
Will 
the 
gentle-
woman yield? 
Ms. DELAURO. I yield to the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. 
LOFGREN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
most of what is in this bill doesn’t need 
a change in the law. You don’t need a 
change in the law to provide training 
to the Capitol Police. That is baseline 
what our obligation is. 
We failed to actually do what we are 
required to do, and to think that some 
further legislative action is needed is 
simply false. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, the 
point is, we are reimbursing the costs 
that were incurred that day. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this important bill to 
better secure our Capitol complex, 
which includes my legislation to pro-
vide body-worn cameras to Capitol Po-
lice officers and require their use. 
Implementing a body-worn camera 
system for the United States Capitol 
Police was recommended in General 
Honore’s important report. 
In the wake of the January 6 attack, 
is there any doubt that the Federal 
criminal investigations would have 
greatly benefited from additional body 
camera footage? 
In addition, in my experience as a 
mayor of a major American city, the 
city of Phoenix, I know that body-worn 
cameras improve safety, improve safe-
ty for officers, for the public, and for 
everyone in the community. They will 
improve safety for the people who work 
here at the Capitol complex. 
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO and 
Congressman RYAN for working with 
me on this important issue. 
b 1000 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just try to address a couple of 
issues that have been raised here dur-
ing this debate. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recount 
the Committee on Appropriations has 
worked for months to gather informa-
tion to inform this bill. There were 12 
subcommittee hearings. Actually, leg-
islative branch, as the gentlewoman 
from Washington State knows, had at 
least eight hearings, and every sub-
committee held more than one com-
mittee hearing. 
In addition to that, other commit-
tees, 
House 
Administration, 
Com-
mittee on Oversight Reform, all had 
hearings with regard to this issue and 
the path forward. Beginning in April, 
Committee on Appropriations engaged 
in intense good-faith negotiations with 
our Republican counterparts. And un-
fortunately, it appears, I believe, that 
the leadership has prevented them 
from reaching an agreement in a time-
ly manner. 
Madam Speaker, I would just men-
tion that the minority leader, he 
looked to sufficient time included in an 
end-of-the-year 
funding 
bill 
to 
strengthen the security of the Capitol 
complex. So in truth, the view was not 
to do it, not to continue in negotiation, 
but in fact, to delay a decision on this 
until the end of the year. We cannot 
wait in order to be able to effectuate 
security of this Capitol for all who 
work here and all who visit here. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON), a member 
of the Committee on Appropriations. 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the Liebengood 
Family Statement on the January 6 
Commission 
and 
Security 
Supple-
mental. 
LIEBENGOOD FAMILY STATEMENT ON THE JAN-
UARY 6 COMMISSION AND SECURITY SUPPLE-
MENTAL 
‘‘We believe a thorough, non-partisan in-
vestigation into the root causes of and the 
response to the January 6th riot is essential 
for our nation to move forward. Howie’s 
death was an immediate outgrowth of those 
events. Every officer who worked that day, 
as well as their families, should have a bet-
ter understanding of what happened. Uncov-
ering the facts will help our nation heal and 
may lessen the lingering emotional bitter-
ness that has divided our country. We im-
plore Congress to work as one and establish 
the proposed Commission. 
Additionally, improved mental health for 
USCP officers has been one of our goals for 
the past four months. Through the tireless 
efforts of Congresswoman Wexton, we are 
honored a wellness program bearing Howie’s 
name has been proposed in the security sup-
plemental along with more resources for the 
program. We welcome and support the new 
funding and staffing initiatives that will 
help prevent future tragedies among the 
USCP.’’ 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of this legisla-
tion. The January 6 insurrection led to 
the deaths of U.S. Capitol police offi-
cers 
Brian 
Sicknick 
and 
Howie 
Liebengood and Metro Police Officer 
Jeffrey Smith. 
We have heard many stories of the 
broken bones and broken spirits that 
officers are still suffering to this day. 
They have been working around the 
clock since the insurrection, and are 
facing unsustainable hours due to 
being understaffed. It is heartbreaking. 
And it is also infuriating to hear other 
Members on this floor attempt to re-
write history and gaslight those offi-
cers with lies about January 6. 
I am proud to have helped secure mil-
lions of dollars in funding through this 
bill for enhancement of mental health 
services, which includes six new coun-
selors who will help the Capitol Police 
during this crisis and into the future. 
I want to especially thank the family 
of fallen Capitol Police Officer Howie 
Liebengood, his wife, Serena, his sib-
lings, John and Anne, for their advo-
cacy on this bill. I hope that it is some 
solace to them that during this tragic 
time, that once this bill is signed into 
law, the Capitol Police Wellness Center 
will be renamed after Howie, so his life, 
legacy, and service to our Capitol will 
forever be remembered. 
Madam Speaker, the Capitol Police 
cannot wait until the end of the year 
for the funding. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this legisla-
tion. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CART-

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker,

sume. 
Madam Speaker, we, as Members of 
Congress, all personally experienced 
the January 6 insurrection. And we owe 
it not only to the people of our Nation,

but to the democratic institutions in 
which we serve to investigate this at-
tack, prosecute those involved to the 
full extent, and ensure that such an 
event never happens again. Madam 
Speaker, there is only one man, one 
person who is quoted on the walls of 
this august Chamber, this people’s 
House. 
Madam Speaker, that quotation is 
above your head, and it is by that man, 
Daniel Webster. This Nation was found-
ed on the principle that we are a Na-
tion of laws, not based on the caprice 
or the whim of people. We are a Nation 
of laws and there was no stronger advo-
cate for that principle than Daniel 
Webster. 
And he said this: He said: The law: it 
has honored us; let us honor it by exe-
cuting it in its fullest severity. 
If we don’t do a proper job of inves-
tigating that insurrection on January 6 
and prosecuting the people at fault, 
and the people in derogation of the 
criminal laws of this Nation, we will 
make a mockery, a sham of everything 
that Daniel Webster stood for. 
To achieve the goal of full account-
ability and adherence to the law in my 
position of chair of the Commerce, Jus-
tice, and Science Appropriation Sub-
committee, I have been actively in-
volved in addressing the issues raised 
following the January 6 insurrection, 
beginning with the immediate inves-
tigation and continuing over the days 
and weeks following the attack on the 
Capitol. 
My subcommittee dug into the sub-
ject at public hearings this spring. We 
explored the subject of domestic vio-
lent extremism in our hearing with the 
Attorney General and the Justice De-
partment’s national security division. 
Based on the results of these efforts, 
the CJS Subcommittee included fund-
ing for three priorities from January 6 
security 
supplemental: 
Reimbursing 
several Justice Department bureaus for 
the January 6-related expenses; more 
resources to enhance the security of 
Federal judges; and most importantly, 
increased resources for Federal pros-
ecutors to ensure they have the fund-
ing to implement the widest possible 
prosecution policy aimed at bringing to 
justice the perpetrators of January 6. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this critical piece of legislation to 
ensure the safety and security of our 
democracy. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my fellow subcommittee chairs. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
the chair of the Committee on Appro-
priations. I thank her for bringing this 
important legislation to the floor. It is 
the product of great, intense review of 
what is needed to go forward, and it is 
lean. There are many other suggestions 
that people have. This is what is ur-
gent for us to do now. 
I thank the Committee on Appropria-
tions, which is one of the committees 
of jurisdiction, having a series of hear-
ings on the subject, all of the sub-
committees of jurisdiction—I think 
there are six on there—and then even 
the Legislative Branch Committee, 
which has the most responsibility, had 
maybe seven hearings. 
In addition to that, let’s start on 
that horrible day. Springing right from 
that, I called upon General Honore to 
review what has happened. I saw the 
work that he did in Katrina. That is 
how I got to know his work, and I knew 
that he would be an objective reviewer 
of what we needed. He put together a 
very blue ribbon committee of law en-
forcement and national security advis-
ers—national security at the general 
level, generals in the military—and 
they put forth their recommendations 
of what we needed to do in the short 
term and in the long term. And many 
of those suggestions, in the short term, 
are in this legislation. 
There are those who say, well, we 
can’t wait till we do the commission 
report—when they vote against the 
commission report—until we do this, 
like next year or the end of the year. 
No, the need is immediate, and it is 
now. 
So I thank Madam Chair DELAURO of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Appropriations, 
these subcommittee chairs for the mul-
tiple hearings that they have had on 
this subject, and I thank the chair of 
the House Administration Committee 
for the hearings that they have had in 
that committee as well to hone in on 
what is urgently needed now. 
I also salute the chair of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, Chair-
man BENNIE THOMPSON, working in a 
bipartisan way with Mr. KATKO, to 
bring the legislation—so important—in 
a bipartisan way to the floor yester-
day. And I salute the work that they 
did. 
Madam Speaker, here we are, we 
have specific needs, honed to how we 
listened to the Architect of the Capitol 
as to what we need to harden the Cap-
itol, the windows and doors. 
There are Members who have said, 
‘‘Why are we doing that?’’ It was just a 
normal day of tourism in the Capitol, 
while that same person who said that 
is pictured in the news pushing fur-
niture up against the door to keep the 
brawlers out of this Chamber. 
Normal day in the Capitol? Not so. 
So we know what is possible now. 
Who could have imagined that the 
President of the United States would 
incite an insurrection? Should we have 
been prepared for that? Who would 
have imagined that? But could we have 
been prepared better? Yes. And we 
know what we must do now. 
This has been an important week in 
the House as a revised gold medal legis-
lation is being submitted. It is bipar-
tisan. I am pleased to hear that the Re-
publican leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, sup-
ports adding those who were attacked, 
assaulted, 
in 
fact, 
killed—the 
one 
killed, Billy Evans—on Good Friday. 
So that is in the works and we will 
take that up as soon as we come back. 
Yesterday, we had a big, strong bi-
partisan 
vote 
on 
the 
commission. 
Today, we are saying this is what we 
need to do now. We may need to do 
more as the commission does its work, 
as the committees of jurisdiction con-
tinue their hearings. So today, we con-
tinue to defend the Constitution and 
the Capitol with an emergency supple-
mental bill. 
Now much of what is happening in 
the Capitol in terms of restriction of 
visitors and the rest relates to COVID. 
And as that unfolds more favorably, we 
need to be sure that when we have chil-
dren come and families enjoy and legis-
lators passing laws and the press cov-
ering it all, and people coming to see 
the people’s House in action, that they 
will be safe. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
legislation, 
again, builds on the action that hap-
pened yesterday, and hopefully, we can 
move quickly through the Senate and 
make the necessary appointments so 
that the product of that will be re-
spected by the American people. 
General 
Honore’s 
report—I 
men-
tioned General Honore—he said, ‘‘The 
breach of the Capitol on January 6 
brought into stark relief the need to 
immediately improve the security of 
the Capitol complex and the security of 
Congressional Members and staff, and 
the workers who make our lives pos-
sible here. Immediate action is there-
fore required.’’ Immediate action is 
therefore required: General Honore. 
This supplemental, again, protects 
Members of Congress, of course, the 
Capitol, employees, visitors, including 
bolstering the physical security of the 
complex, creating a new reaction force 
for cases of emergency. 
It responds to the direct costs of the 
attack on the Capitol. There were di-
rect costs, including related to re-
sponse and presence of the National 
Guard—that has to be paid for—Dis-
trict of Columbia and other Federal 
agencies, and to the prosecution of the 
insurrectionists. 
Proudly, it recognizes the sacrifices 
of the Capitol Police; supporting them 
with overtime pay, bonuses, and trau-
ma support, as well as specialized 
training and equipment. And it honors 
the late Officer Howie Liebengood by 
creating 
the 
‘‘Howard 
C. 
‘Howie’ 
Liebengood Center for Wellness.’’ 
We are very pleased and proud of 
that, and we thank the Liebengood 
family for their involvement in that 
creation, and my colleague, Congress-
woman WEXTON of Virginia for her role 
in this. 
Protecting the security of the Cap-
itol so we can do our constitutional 
work on behalf of the American people 
should 
not 
be 
controversial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2628 
May 20, 2021 
months ago, multiple lives were lost. 
Over 140 law enforcement officers were 
physically harmed. Trauma and terror 
were inflicted on our colleagues, our 
staff, and ourselves. 
b 1015 
Today, in passing this legislation, 
the House is taking a strong step for-
ward to bring healing to our congres-
sional community and to ensure that 
this horror can never happen again. 
Let me close again by quoting Gen-
eral Honore’s report: 
‘‘As you consider the recommenda-
tions of this task force, we must not 
forget it was the riotous actions of an 
angry mob that laid bare the vulnera-
bilities of the Capitol complex. 
‘‘We must not long endure any dis-
course that prevents or delays efforts 
necessary to strengthen the security of 
the U.S. Capitol complex and enhance 
the safety of those who serve the 
American people in Congress.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote on this emergency secu-
rity supplemental to respond. And as 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
pointed out, there are many more 
things that we need to do, but we have 
to prioritize. We have to sequence. We 
can’t wait until we know every answer 
before we start with the solutions that 
we are well-aware and that we know of. 
Again, some of this will depend on 
the resources in this legislation that 
will enable us to find out what it does 
cost to protect the Capitol in a way 
that is the least offensive to all of us, 
that says that this Capitol sits con-
fidently, but assured that we will be 
protected when necessary, but that we 
don’t need all of that protection out-
side, the fences and the rest, all the 
time. If we need it, we will have it 
when we need it. 
Again, those are decisions that have 
to be made from a technical stand-
point, as well as a security and safety 
standpoint, and this legislation enables 
that to happen. 
There are those who say: Well, it 
didn’t work then, so why is it going to 
work? 
You know what, let’s have con-
fidence. 
There is one word that I would say 
we need to rely on in all of this, and 
that is the word ‘‘trust.’’ Let us trust 
in each other that our purpose is the 
same; that we relied on the expert ad-
vice of generals and law enforcement 
and the rest, as to what we need imme-
diately—to use their word, ‘‘imme-
diately.’’ Let us trust that we can have 
the review that is necessary. We must 
have a review of the hierarchy of au-
thority here. 
What is this police board? How is 
that graded? Why can’t we do that in a 
different way? 
We have a search committee looking 
for a new chief of police. Our current 
chief of police may be in that mix, I 
don’t know, because this is an objec-
tive search for a police chief. 
So we look forward to working in a 
bipartisan way because that cannot be 
anything but nonpartisan. The House 
and Senate, Democrats and Repub-
licans, honor our responsibility, our 
housekeeping responsibilities, to keep 
this place safe, and to have a chain of 
command that is clear. 
Where is the responsibility for this? 
Is it in that police board, of which the 
police chief is not a member? 
I agree with the gentlewoman, those 
kinds of issues are not resolved, but 
that should not hold up getting what 
we need in place right now. As the 
virus is relaxing some of the restric-
tions, we will be able, again, to func-
tion this summer as the U.S. Capitol, 
the welcoming beacon of democracy 
that it has always been, but with the 
assurance that it will be safe. 
Madam Speaker, hopefully we will 
have a strong bipartisan vote on this. 
And I am very proud of what happened 
yesterday. I thank the gentlewoman 
for her leadership in that regard. 
Madam Speaker, I praise the Appro-
priations Committee for bringing this 
to the floor. I thank the Homeland Se-
curity Committee for their great work 
and also as the authorizer. I also thank 
the House Administration Committee 
for the piece of this that they have. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with the 
Speaker of the House that we do need 
to trust; and we, at some point, need to 
rely on one another’s better nature, 
honestly. I have been walking through 
that this year ad nauseam, and will 
continue to do so. And it is in that 
same spirit of comity that is part of 
the reason I raised this challenge. I 
have not been afraid to challenge my 
own team at all, but that is part of why 
I am also not afraid to challenge the 
other team. 
If I refer back to General Honore’s re-
port, which is the basis for what we are 
being asked to vote on this for, under 
his piece, the Capitol Police Board De-
cision-making During Emergencies, he 
said: ‘‘The Capitol Police Board’s delib-
erate decision-making process proved 
too slow and cumbersome to respond to 
the crisis in January, delaying requests 
for critical supplemental resources. We 
recommend revisions to 2 U.S. Code 
1970 and 1974 to give the USCP Chief 
the authority to request external law 
enforcement and National Guard sup-
port without CPB preapproval in ex-
traordinary emergency circumstances. 
. . . ‘’ 
And he goes on to explain that. 
So it is not like we have to do a lot 
of research to figure out what laws 
need to change in order to be compli-
ant with General Honore’s report. And 
that would give me a whole lot more— 
it would allow me to trust and verify 
that we are spending this money in the 
way that we should. But they are not 
doing it, Madam Speaker. That is what 
really bugs me. 
We were in good negotiations trying 
to work this out, and all of a sudden 
last week, it is just done, we are not 
going to negotiate anymore. That is 
my problem. 
What other pieces in this bill are not 
fully fleshed out? 
I think it was a very important point 
to make that, look, I am for protecting 
this Capitol and the staff that serve 
here, and the men and women that 
serve here, and I will back up our po-
lice officers any day of the week and 
twice on Sunday, but it really bothers 
me that it is a priority when our secu-
rity is threatened. We have got all 
these other emergencies around this 
country, things like the southern bor-
der, and we are just going to sit on it. 
Madam Speaker, I am not saying 
hold everything back, as is being pro-
moted. They are saying hold every-
thing back just because we don’t have 
everything else figured out. 
Well, why don’t we take the steps 
that we know that need to be ad-
dressed? 
I mentioned the southern border. 
That is a crisis we know. But at least 
take General Honore’s report and im-
plement it, and then I wouldn’t be as 
opposed to funding it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), a member 
of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
congratulations to our chair, Congress-
woman ROSA DELAURO, for her hard 
work. 
Madam Speaker, a day after passing 
the historic commission with robust bi-
partisan help, we are here now to sup-
port this emergency security funding 
bill. The attacks on January 6 exposed 
the dire state of our Capitol’s security 
infrastructure. 
As a member of the Legislative 
Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, 
I have been alarmed to learn of just 
how outdated our security infrastruc-
ture really is, and how we had let it de-
teriorate for far too long. 
The funding package that we are 
about to pass today will change that. It 
will allocate $2 billion in investment, 
including updating cameras on Capitol 
grounds, purchasing new protective 
equipment, increasing the number of 
frequency of security sweeps, et cetera. 
I called for many of these changes 
and improvements back on January 6 
and January 7. I am glad to be here to 
support this. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support 
this bill. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALES). 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, as I have listened to 
the debate on this legislation to pro-
vide emergency funding, I realize it is 
tone-deaf. The true emergencies we 
should be funding are not part of this 
bill. 
We have a southern border crisis. If 
that is not enough, we have a crisis in 
the Middle East. We have an emer-
gency situation at our southern border.

May 20, 2021 
And even as we debate, the United 
States’ closest ally, Israel, is under at-
tack by constant terrorist threat. 
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic 
jihad, proxies of Iran, have been at-
tacking Israel for 2 weeks and have 
fired over 4,000 rockets from Gaza into 
Israel. 
Now is the time to stand with our 
ally, Israel. We need to show them that 
we believe in their right to defend 
themselves, and the United States will 
do everything within our power to en-
sure they defeat these terrorists and 
any attacks by Iran. 
Will my Democrat colleagues choose 
to stand with Israel? Or will they 
cower to the Iranian proxies? 
U.S. security assistance to Israel has 
been crucial to countering the many 
threats Israel faces on a daily basis. 
Our security partnerships serve as an 
active participant. The investment in 
the Iron Dome defense system that 
counters short-range rockets is one of 
the most important investments we 
have made toward the peace in the 
Middle East. 
Not only does it save Israeli lives, it 
saves thousands of Palestinian lives. If 
the 4,000 rockets fired by terrorists had 
hit their targets, Israel would have had 
no choice but to escalate the conflict. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on Appropriations to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 3237. It 
would provide emergency funding for 
the Iron Dome defense system to en-
sure that Israel has the system it needs 
to continue defending against these at-
tacks and enable the Israelis to replen-
ish the thousands of interceptors they 
have used. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say 
that I appreciate the debate that we 
have had today. I don’t think any of us 
disagree on what we want. We want a 
safe and secure Capitol. We want to 
make sure that the people who work 
here are taken care of. We want to 
make sure that we are backfilling ev-
erything from overtime pay to mental 
health needs. And we want to make 
sure that that is all done to fix or to 
address some of the challenges we have 
had this year. 
But, in addition, because we are talk-
ing about such a great sum of money 
and resources, I want to make sure it 
never happens again. There are other 
things that are happening alongside 
this. We have talked about the com-
mission today, and we have talked 
about other things. 
But our responsibility with this is to 
make sure, as appropriators, that we 
are 
spending 
money 
and 
we 
are 
verifying that it is being used to the 
best end. That is, right now, ultimately 
what I think we can do better with. It 
is true right now that the Senate, both 
Republicans and Democrats, are not in 
line with what this legislation is. 
So if we take a little bit more time 
and we do this right, we can come out 
with something that we can all be 
proud of, that will do the job that it is 
intended to do. 
I am very disappointed to recommend 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I am disappointed that the gentle-
woman from Washington State will not 
find her way to vote for the bill. We 
have worked on many issues together 
on the Appropriations Committee, yes, 
in fact, in meetings about the Capitol 
Police Board and other efforts. As it 
has been stated, we worked for months 
on the Appropriations Committee with 
numerous hearings in order to be able 
to engage on a bipartisan basis. 
Unfortunately, the leadership of the 
minority leader, I believe, saw that the 
direction that this bill should go in is 
in the end of the year. In that case, we 
cannot begin to fix the problems that 
occurred. 
Madam Speaker, I remember January 
6, as we all do. I sat in the Gallery. I 
sat right up there as we counted the 
electoral votes, which was our con-
stitutional duty, in order to certify the 
election of the President of the United 
States. 
I was here, at the podium, when the 
Capitol policeman said, The rioters 
have breached the Capitol. They are in 
the rotunda. They are on their way to 
the House Chamber, to those doors 
right there, those doors that were shat-
tered and smashed that day, and where 
there were barricades that were put up 
against it. 
b 1030 
We were told to grab a gas mask. I 
didn’t know we had gas masks here. We 
did that, and no sooner than that, we 
were told we have to evacuate, you 
make your way. 
I can still trace my steps around the 
perimeter of this gallery, all the way 
around, going underneath these bar-
riers here. All of us, Democrats, Repub-
licans, and members of the press who 
were there that day, and young people 
who came here to work, we were to-
gether. We were holding on to one an-
other because we knew there was im-
minent danger. 
I won’t ever forget us getting around 
to that side of the gallery when the 
Capitol Police said to hit the floor be-
cause of gunshots—gunshots. We all hit 
the floor, Democrats and Republicans, 
at the order of the Capitol Police, to 
protect us from what was going on that 
day. 
As I lay on the floor with very little 
juice in my cell phone, I called my hus-
band. I didn’t want to say to him, ‘‘I 
love you,’’ because it brought back to 
me the remembrance of 9/11 and those 
last words that people uttered. I just 
said: ‘‘I am fine. I am going to be evac-
uated. Call the kids and let them know 
it is okay.’’ 
This bill is not about politics. It is 
not about settling scores. It is about 
ensuring that every person who comes 
onto the Capitol Grounds is safe and is 
protected. 
The funding is not optional. This 
vote is not a show vote. It is about pro-
tecting the seat of democracy and the 
men, the women, and the young people 
who work here. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to do the right thing and pass 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the criminal 
invasion of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th 
created an unprecedented test for liberty 
lovers to respond and protect democracy for 
generations to come. 
We owe it to our law enforcement commu-
nity, and indeed everyone who works in or vis-
its our Capitol, to respond with means to re-
cover and rebuild from the insurrection, 
The U.S. Capitol holds national and inter-
national significance as the temple of liberty 
and representational democracy. The invad-
ers, many in paramilitary attire more modern 
and protective than what our own officers 
were provided, exposed gaps and weak-
nesses at the highest levels. Our failure to act 
now only invites our greatest adversaries an 
open door to further harm. 
We continue to mourn the officers we lost, 
those who were physically injured, and the 
countless who continue to suffer from mental 
and emotional distress. Let us act in their 
honor. 
Through Chairwoman DELAURO’s leader-
ship, the Appropriations Committee held ex-
tensive hearings and conversations with secu-
rity experts, gathering critical recommenda-
tions to address the immediate security needs. 
As such, this bill provides $1.9 billion in 
emergency appropriations to: 
Provide funds to repair the physical wounds 
to the Capitol Complex and build back with 
stronger security enhancements. 
It invests in means to protect Members of 
Congress, congressional staff, and visitors fol-
lowing the recommendations of the Capitol 
Security Review. 
It provides resources to the United States 
Capitol Police for officer salaries, equipment, 
training, and mental health counseling. 
And provides resources for enhanced secu-
rity for Members of Congress. 
Today, Congress must provide confidence 
to our Capitol Hill community that the safety 
and security of all who work within and visit 
the temple of liberty remains a top priority. I 
encourage all my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in opposition to H.R. 3237. 
While I support some of its provisions, I 
have strong concerns about many items in-
cluded in this bill and the manner by which the 
majority has crafted it. 
As the Ranking Member of the Defense Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, I am strongly sup-
portive of the reimbursement to the National

Guard for the costs incurred due to their ex-
tended deployment in support of Capitol Police 
and other law enforcement agencies. We need 
to reimburse them as soon as possible to 
avoid having to cancel drill weekend and other 
training. 
Our Guardsmen and women have patrioti-
cally taken time away from their families, ca-
reers, and communities to protect our nation’s 
capital. I, along with my colleagues, thank 
them for their service. 
However, I am strongly opposed to the ma-
jority’s proposal to stand up a Quick Reaction 
Force comprised of the D.C. National Guard. 
While Congress should consider the cre-
ation of a form of a Quick Reaction Force, it 
should be comprised of law enforcement, not 
military. They are better suited and have train-
ing that is more specific to this mission. 
Like much of this bill, the majority has hast-
ily crafted this concept in a partisan manner 
without thinking through all of the ramifica-
tions. Our subcommittee has held no hearings 
on this issue. This issue deserves a much 
more thoughtful and deliberate approach. 
I also echo my colleagues concerns about 
the funding proposed to create physical bar-
riers around the Capitol complex. The ex-
tended duration of the fencing has been en-
tirely unnecessary. Continuing this into the fu-
ture is expensive, misguided, and is unfair to 
the American people—who deserve access to 
their Nation’s Capital. 
For these reasons and others, I urge my 
colleagues to vote no. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the Emergency 
Security Supplemental to Respond to January 
6th Appropriations Act. 
I’d like to thank Speaker PELOSI, Chair-
woman ROSA DELAURO, Subcommittee Chair 
TIM RYAN and the other Subcommittee chairs 
for their extraordinary leadership in crafting 
this emergency package to respond to the ur-
gent need for a safer and more secure Cap-
itol. 
I was here on the House Floor during the 
violent insurrection on January 6th. In carrying 
out our tradition of the peaceful transfer of 
power, a mob tried to violently overthrow our 
government because of Donald Trump’s false 
narrative of election fraud. On the global 
stage, we are a nation that condemns violent 
attempts to negate the outcomes of free and 
fair elections and yet in our Nation’s capital we 
saw an armed standoff at the door of the 
House Chamber and tear gas deployed in the 
rotunda. 
This bill would address the direct costs in-
curred by agencies in the riotous attack. It 
funds security improvements to the Capitol 
and specialized training for Capitol police. 
Lastly, it also provides funding for the contin-
ued prosecution of the perpetrators. 
As we have seen, the lie that incited the riot 
has not gone away. The white supremacist 
ideology that fuels these lies and conspiracy 
theories persists. Looking towards the future, it 
is important that we pass this bill to improve 
the protection of the Capitol for those who visit 
and work here daily. 
I urge the passage of the Emergency Secu-
rity Supplemental to Respond to the January 
6th Appropriations Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 409, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I have a motion to re-
commit at the desk.

Mr. DEFAZIO (during the reading).

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection.

RECOGNIZING PLEASANTDALE 
MIDDLE SCHOOL 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Pleasantdale Middle School 
in Burr Ridge, Illinois, and, specifi-
cally, Jennifer Lauermann’s fifth grade 
science class. 
Mrs. Lauermann is an educator, but 
more importantly, she is a rock star. 
Her 
students 
spent 
this 
semester 
studying rocks, interviewing geologists 
and other scientists across Illinois. 
They learned a lot, but something 
troubling emerged: Illinois does not 
have a State rock. Iowa has the geode, 
Wisconsin has red granite, but Illinois 
has got nothing. 
So as good citizens do, the class held 
an election. Sandstone, limestone, and 
dolostone emerged from a heated pri-
mary, and 1,200 Illinoisans then voted 
in the general election, including me. I 
voted for limestone. 
My candidate didn’t win, but it was a 
free and fair election, and it is now my 
privilege to introduce the winner of the 
Pleasantdale Middle School 2021 State 
rock election. 
Mr. Speaker, dolostone. I hope my 
colleagues in the Illinois delegation 
will join me in supporting the effort to 
make dolostone Illinois’ State rock, 
but, more importantly, I couldn’t be 
prouder to represent such great teach-
ers and students committed to science 
and to democracy. 
f 
ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND 
ITSELF 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, as I speak, 
Israel is under attack by the terrorist 
group Hamas with thousands of rockets 
launched at Israel since May 10. 
Israel has a right to defend itself. 
The United States would never allow 
rockets to be launched by our enemies 
at civilians on our soil, and Israel can-
not allow rockets to be launched at Tel 
Aviv and Jerusalem. 
I was proud to join more than three- 
quarters of my fellow Members of Con-
gress in April to support full funding 
for security assistance to Israel. As we 
said in that letter, Congress is com-
mitted to maintaining Israel’s quali-
tative military edge and its ability to 
defend itself, by itself, against per-
sistent threats. 
Today, it is even more important to 
stand up and say: We stand side by side 
with our ally. I will continue to work 
to continue to help Israel defend itself 
from Hamas’ threats and to cut off the 
support to Hamas. 
f 
STOP ASIAN HATE 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to join my colleagues in 
bringing attention to the widespread 
violence against the Asian-American 
community. This pandemic has in-
flamed hatred and racism, and we must 
lend our voices in support of our Asian- 
American brothers and sisters. 
In Georgia, just 2 months ago, a hor-
rific 
attack 
targeted 
three 
Asian- 
owned spas, and eight lives were lost. 
They were working parents, grand-
parents, and spouses, and they left be-
hind an unconscionable loss and empti-
ness in their communities. 
We know that this attack is not iso-
lated. Since the start of the pandemic, 
there have been more than 6,600 re-
ported incidents of anti-Asian hate. 
Across this country, Asian Americans 
are living in fear for the safety of 
themselves, their friends, and their 
families. 
On this floor this week, we passed 
two critical pieces of legislation to 
condemn the attack in Georgia and to 
ensure accountability for hate crimes 
against the Asian-American commu-
nity. 
We must continue to stand with the 
Asian-American community and put an 
end to this violence. My district, my 
home State of Nevada, and our Nation, 
welcome diversity, and acts of hatred 
and bigotry have no place here.

TOURISM IN ALASKA 
(Mr. YOUNG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I just 
passed a legislative bill, so I am a little 
bit excited. 
I wanted to especially thank Chair-
man 
DEFAZIO, 
Leader 
HOYER, 
and 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader MCCARTHY, 
Ranking Member GRAVES, Chairman 
NEAL, Ranking Member BRADY, and the 
Biden administration and all the staff 
for recognizing the necessity of this 
legislation. 
I especially also would like to thank 
my Senate colleagues, Senators MUR-
KOWSKI, SULLIVAN, and CANTWELL, who 
have been partners in this effort. 
Finally, I would like to thank my 
chief of staff, Kevin Swanson, for his 
hard work on this legislation. 
We lost billions of dollars last year 
because of COVID in the tourist indus-
try, and this bill we just passed by this 
House unanimously will give us an op-
portunity to recover not the money, 
but the ability to serve the people of

MICHAEL BROWN 
(Ms. BUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise today to wish a happy 25th 
birthday to Michael Brown, Jr. 
The 
last 
birthday 
that 
Michael 
Brown celebrated was his 18th, a cele-
bration that was supposed to mark the 
beginning of his journey to adulthood 
filled with years of joy making music, 
caring for animals, and spending time 
with those he loved. But just 81 days 
after his 18th birthday, he was shot and 
killed by a St. Louis police officer. 
While I say that St. Louis and I rise 
today, we have never taken a seat, we 
have never rested, and we have never 
stopped striving for a just world, a 
world where Michael would have been 
celebrating his birthday today. 
To Michael Brown, Jr.: We love you, 
we miss you, we will never forget you, 
and in your honor, we bring our strug-
gle for justice from the front lines of 
Ferguson, which is why I am standing 
here to the Halls of Congress. 
Stand up, don’t stand down. 
We do this for Mike Brown. 
Happy birthday.

FAREWELL TO JACK WALECKI 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to offer my sin-
cere gratitude to one of the most val-
ued and dedicated members of my 
team, Jack Walecki. 
After over 4 years of service to our 
country and the people of Louisiana’s 
Fourth Congressional District, Jack is 
going to be leaving our D.C. office to 
pursue a law degree at Pepperdine Uni-
versity. 
For the past 21⁄2 years, and through 
some of the most historically signifi-
cant events in recent memory, I have 
relied upon Jack’s steady counsel as 
my lead staffer for judiciary issues. His 
level head and steadfast commitment 
to his work have been instrumental in 
helping to right the ship in truly tu-
multuous times. 
More importantly, Jack’s easy-going, 
quintessentially 
California 
attitude 
will leave a lasting mark on our team. 
We will sorely miss his obscure cul-
tural references and random tidbits of 
knowledge that would make a trivia 
master’s head spin. 
We are all saddened to see Jack 
leave, but we are also delighted to see 
him take this next step in his life. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Jack for all his 
work and dedication. God has great 
plans for your life. Our family and staff 
wish him all the best. 
Onward, my friend.

SUPPORT OUR ALLY ISRAEL 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in unequivo-
cal support of our ally Israel. 
As a sovereign state, Israel has every 
right and a duty to protect its people 
from the unprovoked attacks of the 
Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas. 
It is painful to watch the parents and 
their terrified children fleeing to bomb 
shelters as rockets rain down indis-
criminately on civilian neighborhoods. 
Thankfully, our Israeli friends are pro-
tected by the Iron Dome, a joint U.S.- 
Israeli defense initiative that has saved 
countless lives. 
It is shameful that some within our 
Congress choose to condemn our long-
time ally for simply defending them-
selves. No doubt, if a similar attack 
took place in the U.S., these same 
Members would expect our military to 
protect their homes and communities. 
Sadly, we shouldn’t be surprised 
when terrorist groups like Hamas feel 
emboldened to attack our allies when 
the Biden administration’s policies sig-
nal weakness to our adversaries. 
I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to speak up, with one 
voice, in support of Israel, one of our 
great allies.

BORDER CRISIS HAS NO END IN 
SIGHT 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, it has been 
57 days since Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS was named the point person on 
the border. She still has not visited. 
The entire Biden administration con-
tinues to distract from, deny, and 
downplay this public health, humani-
tarian, and national security crisis. 
Apprehensions in the month of April 
are up more than 100,000, higher than 
they were in January of this year. This 
has been ongoing for months, and the 
administration still has no plan. 
The Biden border crisis is costing 
American lives and billions in taxpayer 
dollars and is once again placing the 
responsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment on individual States. 
When is enough enough? When will 
the Biden administration stop allowing 
criminal cartels to reap billions in 
profits from their inaction? When will 
the Biden administration stop failing 
to fulfill their constitutional mandate 
to keep the American people safe? It is 
anyone’s best guess. 
But with Democrats controlling the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House, the Biden border crisis has no 
end in sight.

EXTENDING 
THANKS 
TO 
EDU-
CATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS 
AND 
TEACHERS 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, the 
problems of today will rest squarely on 
the shoulders of America’s children. 
There is nothing more foundational to 
the longevity of this Republic than in-
vesting in the next generation. 
During this COVID pandemic, edu-
cating our students and preparing 
them to face the battles and turmoil of 
the future has never been harder. If we 
have learned one thing through this 
pandemic, it is that in-person teaching 
is foundational to future success. 
I want to extend the thanks of a 
grateful district to the teachers of 
Veritas 
Christian 
Academy, 
head-
master Dr. Robert M. Woods, and other 
institutions 
who 
remained 
open 
throughout this pandemic and placed 
the needs of our schoolchildren first. 
Your valiant efforts are seen. Your 
dedication to America’s youth in the 
face of great challenges is recognized. 
And your great determination to safe-
guard our future leaders is of high com-
mendation. 
Thank you for all that you do, and I 
look forward to being back in the dis-
trict to see you all soon.

CHARTING ECONOMIC CHANGES 
DUE TO BIDEN POLICY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
chart by the Republican Study Com-
mittee shows the difference not just a 
year makes but what an attitude to 
governing makes toward making a liv-
ing and managing families’ needs, even 
enjoying what you have earned and 
how you see fit to spend it. 
Energy independence: Stopping pro-
duction and oil and gas infrastructure 
in the U.S. gives higher prices, which 
are eclipsing $4 now even in my home 
State of California. 
Lumber: Though our California and 
Western forests burn millions of acres 
each year, somehow we have a lack of 
harvest and lumber shortages, thanks 
to strange environmental thinking pro-
hibiting the forest harvest and man-
agement we need to prevent fires and 
keep the lumberyards full. I know it is 
not the logger or the log truck driver 
making the killing here in the quad-
ruple pricing per board-foot. 
Home costs: They ride right up there 
with lumber as well, and all the other 
inputs, up 20 percent. 
Coffee: Up 50 percent. Coffee has to 
come from somewhere.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

May 20, 2021 
Wheat: Up big. Bread and cereal 
won’t be any cheaper. Will the farmer 
see this windfall? Not likely. 
Corn: The same thing. Will the farm-
er do any better with the much higher 
cost of corn? No. 
Copper: Used in so many of our me-
chanical and electrical devices, it is 
going up, making it harder to wire our 
homes. 
The bottom line is: Everything you 
need is much more expensive, thanks 
to Biden policy.

SENATE MUST STOP INHUMANITY 
OF POLICE BRUTALITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, in the spirit of Shirley 
Chisholm. 
I 
rise 
unbought 
and 
unbossed, a liberated Democrat. 
And I rise today, Mr. Speaker, with a 
great deal of pain in my heart. I am 
saddened. And I am, quite frankly, 
very, very disgusted and disappointed. 
I saw a news story this morning that 
brought me to tears. I could not believe 
what I saw and I heard. I would like to 
share now some passages from a story 
in The New York Times that relate to 
what I saw this morning, what I heard 
this morning. I would ask that persons 
who are very sensitive to things involv-
ing pain and suffering be mindful of 
what I am about to do and might gov-
ern themselves appropriately because 
this is very painful to hear and very 
sad to understand that it actually oc-
curred. 
This story is styled ‘‘Footage Shows 
Louisiana 
Troopers 
Punching 
and 
Dragging Man Who Died.’’ 
I was born in Louisiana, in New Orle-
ans. I have friends there. I have some 
sense of what the State is like, but 
even this exceeds some of what I know 
can happen in Louisiana. 
This article goes on to read: ‘‘Rel-
atives of Ronald Greene,’’ no relation-
ship as far as I know, ‘‘were initially 
told that he had died from injuries he 
sustained in a crash after he failed to 
stop for a traffic violation outside 
Monroe, Louisiana, in May 2019, ac-
cording to a lawyer for the family.’’ 
May 2019. You can do the math. That 
was some time ago. Some of us would 
say it was a long time ago. 
‘‘Body-camera footage obtained and 
published by the Associated Press on 
Wednesday showed Mr. Greene, 49, 
screaming, 
‘I’m 
sorry,’ 
and 
‘I’m 
scared,’ after troopers opened the door 
to his car and jolted him with a stun 
gun after a high-speed chase.’’ 
I recall instructions from my mother. 
Her instructions when I was a young 
child were to never run from the police. 
Never run from the police. She was em-
phatic about it, and she explained why. 
Never run from the police, she ex-
plained to me, her young son, because 
the police will catch you and when 
they do, they are going to whip you. 
She explained to me that the police are 
of the opinion that if you run, a part of 
your punishment is a good whipping. 
This is what my mother explained to 
me as a child. So, we find today Mr. 
Greene saying, ‘‘I’m sorry,’’ and, ‘‘I’m 
scared.’’ 
‘‘ ‘I’m scared,’ Mr. Greene screamed, 
according to the video.’’ He went on to 
say, ‘‘ ‘I’m your brother. I’m scared,’ ’’ 
pleading, if you will. The ‘‘pleading’’ is 
what I am adding. That is not in the 
story, but pleading. 
‘‘According to the AP, which said it 
had obtained 46 minutes of video foot-
age from the encounter, one trooper 
wrestled Mr. Greene to the ground, put 
him in a choke hold,’’ some things bear 
repeating, ‘‘put him in a choke hold 
and punched him in the face. Another 
trooper briefly dragged him by his 
ankle shackles as he lay on the ground, 
according to the footage.’’ 
We know about choke holds. We 
know about knees on necks. We know 
that people are not always treated with 
respect. 
Mind you, Mr. Greene, so far, has not 
exhibited a weapon. Yes, he was run-
ning, in the sense that he was driving 
away from the police. Yes, he should 
have stopped by standards that we like 
to employ. But does running from the 
police, driving your car away from the 
police, does this entitle the police to 
kick, tase multiple times, and drag a 
person? 
‘‘Mr. Greene was jolted again with 
the stun gun while he was on the 
ground 
and 
handcuffed.’’ 
On 
the 
ground, handcuffed, and jolted again 
with a stun gun. This is what the foot-
age shows, according to this news arti-
cle. 
‘‘The AP reported that the troopers, 
who were White,’’ again, some things 
bear repeating, ‘‘AP reported that the 
troopers, who were White, left Mr. 
Greene, who was Black, facedown and 
moaning for more than 9 minutes, as 
they wiped blood from their hands and 
face.’’ 
Mr. Greene is facedown, pleading, 9 
minutes. The officers are wiping blood 
from their hands and face. 
‘‘ ‘I hope this guy ain’t got AIDS,’ one 
of the troopers said on the video, add-
ing an expletive.’’ 
He was concerned for himself at a 
time when a man is bleeding and in 
need of attention, medical attention, I 
might add. Officers have a duty to pro-
vide medical attention. When we are in 
combat with enemies, enemies who 
would destroy us, destroy our country, 
if we catch an enemy and that enemy 
is hurt, in need of medical attention, 
we provide aid and comfort. 
Mr. Greene was not an enemy to the 
United States of America. He wasn’t an 
enemy of this country. Mr. Greene 
wasn’t trying to kill these officers. 
b 1245 
Yes, he resisted. But does resistance 
afford or grant the officers the legal 
right to abuse him to the extent that 
he finds himself on the ground bleed-
ing; they find themselves wiping blood 
from their hands and their face, and 
then concluding, ‘‘I hope this guy ain’t 
got AIDS’’? 
There are people who don’t want to 
hear the things that I have to say 
about invidious discrimination. They 
don’t want to hear it because they 
don’t want to acknowledge that it ex-
ists. Not only does it exist, it exists 
more than we know. 
But for the body cameras, this 
wouldn’t be in The New York Times. It 
is in The New York Times because 
there is now evidence, clear and con-
vincing evidence, that it actually oc-
curred. But there are people who don’t 
want to hear a Member come to the 
floor of the House of Representatives 
and call these things to the attention 
of the world. 
We call them to the attention of the 
world, because the world needs to know 
we have been right for years upon 
years, decades on decades, in making 
known these issues that have been ig-
nored. 
Now the truth is being revealed. 
George Floyd, the truth was revealed. 
Ronald Greene, the truth has been re-
vealed. 
Let’s go on. This story indicates 
that: ‘‘The Louisiana State Police said 
on Wednesday’’—mind you, this is 
Wednesday in May of 2019—‘‘The Lou-
isiana State Police said on Wednesday 
that 
the 
investigation 
into 
Mr. 
Greene’s death ‘remains under review 
by Federal and State authorities.’’’ 
My dear friends, my dear brothers, 
and my dear sisters, if an animal—let’s 
say a dog—if they had treated a dog 
the way they treated Mr. Greene, a 
human being, the investigation would 
be over, the punishment would have 
been assessed, and I would dare say 
that they would have received punish-
ment much more severe than what I 
am about to read to you. 
The article states: ‘‘One of the troop-
ers, who was involved in the encounter 
. . . was temporarily suspended and is 
back on the force.’’ 
Some things bear repeating. 
‘‘One of the troopers who was in-
volved in the encounter . . . was tem-
porarily suspended and is back on the 
force.’’ This is what the State police 
said. 
I am not sure that the humane soci-
ety would have allowed this to go with-
out some additional repercussions, law-
ful repercussions, I might add, if an 
animal, a dog, were treated the way 
Mr. Greene was treated. 
Remember, Mr. Greene was pleading: 
‘‘I’m your brother. I’m scared.’’ Beg-
ging, ‘‘I’m sorry,’’ he said. 
Dear friends, Mr. Greene’s death was 
ruled accidental and was attributed to 
cardiac arrest. How can we allow this 
to stand? 
The family commissioned an inde-
pendent autopsy that found severe in-
juries to Mr. Greene’s head and skull 
and several wounds to his face. But the

officers concluded his death was acci-
dental. This is my commentary now. 
His death was accidental and was at-
tributed to cardiac arrest. 
In the world that I live in, this is 
called a coverup. In the world that I 
live in, this video is the evidence need-
ed, coupled with the time that has 
elapsed, to substantiate the coverup. 
There may be more evidence. There 
may be more evidence that would be of 
benefit. But my dear friends, for a 
human being to be treated as Mr. 
Greene was treated and then have one 
person temporarily suspended—there 
may be other things that have oc-
curred. This is a news story. All of the 
facts may not be in. One person sus-
pended, and it reported that his death 
was ruled accidental, attributed to car-
diac arrest. 
We must pass the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act. What more do we 
need? We have George Floyd, his death. 
We have now Mr. Greene. These inci-
dents—as they are called by people who 
live in polite society—these incidents 
continue to occur. What more do we 
need to pass legislation in the Senate 
of the United States of America, where 
we have people who have taken an oath 
to protect? What do we need to pass 
the 
legislation 
that 
will 
ban 
chokeholds? This man was choked. 
What do we need to pass legislation 
so that lawsuits can continue, so that 
they won’t be dismissed on grounds 
that are archaic? It may not be insane, 
but it is an inanity. What do we need to 
end this inanity? What is going on in 
the Senate, the Senate of the United 
States of America, land of ‘‘liberty and 
justice’’—I say the Pledge of Alle-
giance—‘‘for all.’’ I say the Pledge of 
Allegiance. I love my country, but I 
don’t love what is happening in the 
United States Senate. 
It is time for this piece of legislation 
to receive its day. It ought to be voted 
on, immediately, if not sooner. What is 
going on in the United States Senate? 
How can we tolerate this level of inhu-
manity? What is going on in the United 
States Senate? 
At some point, on the infinite con-
tinuum that we call time, we are all 
going to have to account for our time. 
And on that day of judgment, it won’t 
be based upon how many millionaires 
did you try to help because you were a 
Member of Congress and you had the 
opportunity to pass laws to benefit 
millionaires 
and 
billionaires. 
That 
won’t be what your judgment is based 
on. It won’t be based on how many full 
bellies did you try to feed. At some 
point, we are going to have to account 
for our actions. At some point, judg-
ment is going to be how did you treat 
the least, the last, and the lost among 
us. 
Judgment is not going to be how did 
you treat the well-off, the well-heeled, 
and the well-to-do. They always fare 
well. The judgment is going to be how 
did you treat the Greene’s of the world, 
how did you treat the Floyds of the 
world. 
Senators, I beg you, do not allow 
rules that benefit the lawlessness that 
is taking place to prevent you from 
doing the righteous thing. You have an 
opportunity to move on this legisla-
tion. I beg that you would do so. 
I am but one person. I am sure that 
there are others who would agree with 
some of what I have said. But I come to 
the floor to say this, because I want 
my record to show that when I had a 
chance to stand up against injustice, I 
did so. 
I am saddened by what happened to 
Mr. Greene, to Mr. Floyd, to Ms. 
Breonna Taylor, and to many others 
whose names that you don’t know: Joe 
Campos Torres, thrown in a bayou in 
Houston, 
Texas, 
handcuffed; 
Billy 
Keith Joyvies; Randall Alan Webster, 
chased down the Freeway, shot; Ida 
Lee Delaney, shot out on the freeway 
in Houston. There are many names 
that you don’t know. But if you do the 
research, you will find that in each one 
of those cases, there were concerns re-
lated to the way the police handled 
them. 
So I have done what I can do today. 
But if God gives me the strength, I will 
be back again and again and again and 
again. I want my record to show I gave 
it my best, I tried, and I will continue 
to try. 
At this time, I have a colleague who 
desires time. I am going to yield to him 
as much time as he may consume of 
the time that I have left. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Mr. 
GREEN is not just a passionate rep-
resentative of the people of the Ninth 
District of Texas, he speaks for mil-
lions and millions of people across the 
country. It has been very moving to 
hear him talk about the problem of po-
lice brutality and violence, which 
threatens our social contract. 
The whole purpose of the social con-
tract is that we will be safer inside of 
it than we will be outside of it. And, 
yet, the social contract is not working 
for a lot of people in a lot of different 
parts of the country. 
So I thank him for his passionate 
leadership on behalf of the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act and for 
having us address this central problem. 
b 1300 
I appreciate your yielding to me. I 
wanted to spend a few minutes talking 
about what is going on in the Middle 
East. It has been a brutal week for 
Israeli and Palestinian civilians, as 
hundreds have been killed in the sav-
age violence that is engulfing the Mid-
dle East now. 
This week I had the opportunity to 
meet on Zoom with young Palestinians 
and Israelis who are part of a group 
called New Story Leadership, which is 
a peace-building group that, since 2009, 
has brought Israeli and Palestinian in-
terns to come work on Capitol Hill. 
I have had these interns work for me 
for, I think, 5 or 6 years, really ever 
since I arrived in the House of Rep-
resentatives. They come to work, and 
they come to interact with each other. 
They come to learn about democracy 
and human rights from America, a 
country that was conceived with the 
dream of human rights and equality for 
everybody. Although that was not re-
motely the reality for a lot of people, 
but it has been the struggle for human 
rights and for equality that has defined 
the American ethos and the American 
spirit. 
So I asked these young Israeli and 
Palestinian former interns for me and 
for other Members of Congress, as part 
of the New Story Leadership program, 
to write to me about what is going on 
in their lives. Because too often, of 
course, our sense of what is happening 
in a foreign land is filtered through 
media, and it is filtered through dif-
ferent kinds of party propaganda. I 
wanted to hear directly from them. I 
thought I would share with you some of 
the responses I got. I want to enter 
them into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Here is one from a Jewish Israeli cit-
izen named Meshi: My name is Meshi. I 
am an Israeli American, currently liv-
ing in Tel Aviv. I was born and raised 
in northern Israel, where my early 
childhood was spent under rocket fire 
from Hezbollah. Today, in my late 20s, 
I am under rocket fire from Hamas. In 
the last week or so, I have taken shel-
ter in my building’s old stairway. I 
have run for cover in the street. I saw 
the lynching of an Arab citizen by a 
Jewish mob on live TV. And I worried 
for my brother-in-law, who had to 
leave my sister and their newborn son 
at home after he was called into re-
serve duty. 
Here’s one from a Jewish Israeli cit-
izen named Eran: My name is Eran Nis-
san. I was an intern in Congressman 
RASKIN’s office in 2019. I became a 
peace activist because of my military 
service, where I served as a combat sol-
dier in the Israeli Special Forces. For 4 
years, I was sent to countless missions 
to all of Israel’s borders: Lebanon, 
Syria, but mainly the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. I experienced combat. I lost 
friends and I lost classmates. These 
past 2 weeks have been the scariest and 
most depressing time of my entire life. 
I spent the last week monitoring right-
wing groups on social media, where ter-
rorist organizations planned and orga-
nized lynchings and riots throughout 
Israel. I did this as part of my digital 
activism, working with former intel-
ligence officers turned progressive po-
litical activists. My neighborhood in 
Jaffa used to be a beacon of coexist-
ence and cooperation between Jews and 
Arabs. Now it is a war zone. The sounds 
of exploding stun grenades from the 
nearby riots are only disturbed by the 
sirens sending everyone into the shel-
ters and stairways. 
This is from Marwa, who is a Pales-
tinian on the West Bank: My name is 
Marwa Odeh. I am a Palestinian Amer-
ican from Hewara in Area C of the West 
Bank. I was an intern in Congressman

RASKIN’s office in 2018. This year, a 
Muslim high holy day became a day of 
chaos and despair for my family. On 
the day of Eid, May 13, my cousin 
Yehya, who I used to play soccer with 
in my grandparents’ backyard, was 
shot in the eye with a rubber bullet 
fired by an Israeli soldier. The rubber 
bullet tore open his left eyeball, leav-
ing Yehya blind in one eye. After that 
military action, my mother and my 
baby sister Jena traveled to the hos-
pital and were caught in a barrage of 
tear gas and rubber bullets. Jena, who 
is just 5 years old, explained to me the 
horror and fear that she went through: 
‘‘I was choking and my eyes were burn-
ing. We were just going to see Yehya. 
We did nothing,’’ she told me in a 
FaceTime call that night. 
Here’s one from Lujayn, a Pales-
tinian who lives in East Jerusalem: My 
name is Lujayn. I am a Palestinian liv-
ing in East Jerusalem, in a small vil-
lage called Beit Hanina, which is sur-
rounded by settlements. One of the 
most basic human rights is to feel safe 
and secure, but my family and I cannot 
feel safe in East Jerusalem. We can’t 
feel safe because settlers under the pro-
tection of Israeli soldiers are chanting 
‘‘Death to Arabs’’ and attacking Pal-
estinians in my neighborhood. I can’t 
feel safe because an Israeli soldier 
threw a stun grenade at my father as 
we walked out of Al-Aqsa Mosque dur-
ing Ramadan. I can’t feel safe walking 
to the market and even sitting in my 
own house. During the past few days, I 
have been telling my sisters and par-
ents to turn off the lights at home so 
that no one will think we are there. 
When I traveled to my university a few 
days ago to get my diploma, I felt like 
a walking target because I was con-
stantly afraid I would be attacked just 
because I am a Palestinian. 
Here’s one from Danni, a Jewish 
Israeli: My name is Danni, and I am a 
Jewish Israeli. I am engaged to an 
Israeli combat soldier, and we live in 
Haifa, which is known as the city of co-
existence. In Haifa, I study and work 
with Arabs and Jews alike. Last week, 
our city was hit by a wave of violence 
by citizens against citizens. Violent ex-
tremists have roamed the streets, ter-
rorizing people and vandalizing people. 
Dear American people, I know that you 
understand how dangerous it is to stay 
silent when you see discrimination, op-
pression, and violence. It is simply 
unsustainable. We need to move past 
the status quo so that I can marry my 
fiance instead of him going to war, 
only to return to a broken city. 
Here’s one from Tasnim, who lives in 
the Gaza: My name is Tasnim, and I am 
a Palestinian from Gaza. My family 
and I left Gaza during the 2008 war. Un-
fortunately, when we moved, my sister 
was separated from her children and 
they stayed in Gaza. Today, my two 
nieces, Iama and Heba, who are young 
and dream of traveling the world, still 
live there in Gaza. Since the airstrikes 
have started, we have been calling 
them every single day to check to see 
if they are still alive. We hear of con-
stant attacks where kids are being bur-
ied under the rubble of their own 
houses, along with their dreams. We 
are constantly afraid that the next 
time we call them, we will not be able 
to reach them. The fear and stress that 
come with trying to connect with my 
family in Gaza is unimaginable. 
Mr. Speaker, forgive me, how much 
time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 28 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RASKIN. This is from Baha, a 
Palestinian from the West Bank: My 
name is Baja Ebdeir, and I am from the 
occupied village of Beit Nattiff. Now I 
live in Beit Jala. This past Ramadan, 
Israel refused to issue permits for Pal-
estinians to observe prayers at Al-Aqsa 
Mosque. However, my father was one of 
the few luckiest to be issued a permit 
for a medical appointment he had at 
the hospital in East Jerusalem. It was 
not the medical appointment itself 
that got my father all excited and 
happy, but the fact that he could use it 
to observe the holiest night of Rama-
dan, Laylit Al-Qadr, the night of de-
cree, at Al-Aqsa Mosque, where our 
destiny is determined by God for the 
whole year. Before he left, my father 
told us, ‘‘After all, I have a permit, 
what could happen?’’ 
Actually, a lot happened in the two 
days my father spent at Al-Aqsa. As 
the evening went by, an army of Israeli 
soldiers began to increase in number. 
As soon as the Imam uttered ‘‘Allah 
Akbar,’’ God is the greatest, to start 
off the holiest night prayer, Israeli sol-
diers threw gas canisters at worshipers. 
As a result of the excessive amount of 
gas my father inhaled, his severe 
coughing continues until today and his 
eyes are as red as blood. 
Usually my father never shares his 
fears with me, but this time he opened 
up and I listened with awe. With every 
cough, my father vividly remembers 
Al-Aqsa Mosque as a war zone where 
Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets and 
threw gas canisters at Palestinians. 
Hundreds were injured and many of the 
elderly lost their lives on the holiest 
night. 
Here is one from Doron, a Jewish 
Israeli citizen: My name is Doron, and 
I am an Israeli who has lived in Jeru-
salem for the last decade. Since 2009, I 
have participated in peaceful protests 
in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah 
every week. I was touched to see how 
during the recent few months, these 
protests have gained support and mo-
mentum in Israel, Palestine, and inter-
nationally. Suddenly, activists in the 
region and around the world demanded 
justice for the residents of Sheikh 
Jarrah, who have been evicted from 
their homes. Unfortunately, everything 
was disrupted by the recent escalation, 
which was orchestrated to undermine 
the local movement in Jerusalem be-
fore it was able to achieve any gains. 
Jerusalem is the home of Israelis and 
Palestinians, and it should be equal, 
free, and safe for all its inhabitants. 
Residents of Sheikh Jarrah should not 
be afraid to be evicted from their 
homes at any moment. 
Here is one from Diala, a Palestinian 
citizen of Israel: My name is Diala, and 
I am a Palestinian citizen of Israel 
from Nazareth. During the past few 
weeks, I have protested alongside many 
Palestinian women against evictions in 
the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in 
Jerusalem. I am a feminist and I 
strongly believe that the struggle for 
gender equality is deeply connected to 
this struggle. As the police cracked 
down on us, a group of peaceful 
protestors 
consisting 
primarily 
of 
women, an Israeli police officer kicked 
me and pushed me to the ground. As I 
lay on the ground, he continued to 
kick me, aiming at my legs and ribs. 
Throughout my life, I have been told 
repeatedly that I have full and equal 
rights as a citizen of Israel. However, 
this week, I have witnessed the oppres-
sive brutality at play against me and 
my people. 
Mr. Speaker, we owe these young 
people a different future. In Israel and 
in the West Bank and in Gaza, we owe 
them a future of peace and justice and 
prosperity, where rockets are not rain-
ing down on the people of Israel or the 
people in the West Bank or the people 
in Gaza. We owe them a future where 
every young person can cultivate his or 
her own creative talents and dreams 
for the future. We owe them a future of 
mutual security for all sides and 
human rights for all people. 
Everyone knows that the first cas-
ualty of war is the truth. We want to 
make sure that the stories that people 
are living on the ground are not con-
sumed in any kind of party propa-
ganda. 
I urge my colleagues to listen to the 
voices of young Israelis and young Pal-
estinians suffering through this brutal 
cycle of violence and ethnic conflict 
and systemic injustice. We owe it to 
them to call openly and loudly on 
Prime Minister Netanyahu and on 
Hamas to accept an immediate cease- 
fire and an end to all violence against 
civilians. This is the precondition for 
moving forward to real peace and re-
spect for the human rights of all. 
I applaud President Biden and his ad-
ministration’s commitment to ending 
this violence. I hope that America will, 
again, with the new administration, be 
able to resume a forward-looking and 
constructive role in addressing all of 
the problems that beset the people in 
Israel and the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this week I met on Zoom with 
young Israelis and Palestinians who are part 
of New Story Leadership, a peacebuilding 
group that, since 2009, has brought dozens of 
Palestinian and Israeli youth to work as sum-
mer interns on Capitol Hill and to share their 
stories with Members of Congress. Here are a 
few of the stories my former interns and other 
participants sent me about the horrific events 
of the last few weeks:

May 20, 2021 
MESHI—JEWISH ISRAELI 
My name is Meshi, I’m an Israeli American, 
currently living in Tel-Aviv. I was born and 
raised in northern Israel where my early child-
hood was spent under rocket fire from 
Hezbollah, and today, in my late twenties, I’m 
under rocket fire from Hamas. In the last week 
or so I’ve taken shelter in my building’s old 
stairway, run for cover in the street, saw the 
lynching of an Arab citizen by a Jewish mob 
on live TV, and worried for my brother-in-law 
that had to leave my sister and their newborn 
son at home after he was called into reserve 
duty. 
ERAN—JEWISH ISRAELI 
My name is Eran Nissan. I was an intern in 
Congressman Jamie Raskin’s office in 2019. I 
became a peace activist because of my mili-
tary service, where I served as a combat sol-
dier in the Israeli special forces. For four years 
I was sent to countless missions to all of 
Israel’s borders—Lebanon, Syria, but mainly 
the West Bank and the Gaza strip. I experi-
enced combat, I lost friends and classmates. 
These past two weeks have been the scar-
iest and most depressing time of my life. I 
spent the last week monitoring Right Wing 
groups on social media, where Jewish terrorist 
organizations planned and organized lynching 
and riots throughout Israel. I did this as part of 
my digital activism, working with ex-intel-
ligence officers turned progressive political ac-
tivists. My neighborhood in Jaffa used to be a 
beacon of coexistence and cooperation be-
tween Jews and Arabs. Now it is a war zone. 
The sounds of exploding stun grenades from 
the nearby riots are only disturbed by the si-
rens, sending everyone to the shelters and 
stairways. 
MARWA—WEST BANK PALESTINIAN 
My name is Marwa Odeh, I am a Pales-
tinian American from Hewara in Area C of the 
West Bank. I was an intern in Congressman 
JAMIE RASKIN’s office in 2018. 
This year, a Muslim high holy day became 
a day of chaos and despair for my family. On 
the day of Eid, May 13th, my cousin, Yehya, 
who I used to play soccer with in my grand-
parents’ backyard, was shot in the eye with a 
rubber bullet fired by an Israeli soldier. The 
rubber bullet tore open his left eyeball, leaving 
Yehya blind in one eye. After that military ac-
tion, my mother and my baby sister, Jena, 
traveled to the hospital and were caught in a 
barrage of tear gas and rubber bullets. Jena, 
who is just 5 years old, explained to me the 
horror and fear she went through. ‘‘I was 
choking and my eyes were burning. We were 
just going to see Yehya, we did nothing,’’ she 
told me in a FaceTime call that night. 
LUJAYN—PALESTINIAN EAST-JERUSALEMITE 
My name is Lujayn and I am a Palestinian 
living in East Jerusalem in a small village 
called Beit Hanina, which is surrounded by 
settlements. 
One of the most basic human rights is to 
feel safe and secure, but my family and I can-
not feel safe in East Jerusalem. We can’t feel 
safe because settlers under the protection of 
Israeli soldiers are chanting ‘‘Death to Arabs’’ 
and attacking Palestinians in my neighbor-
hood. I can’t feel safe because an Israeli sol-
dier threw a stun grenade at my father as we 
walked out of AI-Aqsa Mosque during Rama-
dan. I can’t feel safe walking to the market, 
and even sitting in my own house. During the 
past few days, I have been telling my sisters 
and parents to turn off the lights at home so 
that no on will think we are there. When I trav-
eled to my university a few days ago to get 
my diploma, I felt like a walking target be-
cause I was constantly afraid that I would be 
attacked, just because I am a Palestinian. 
DANNI—JEWISH ISRAELI 
My name is Danni, and I am a Jewish 
Israeli. I am engaged to an Israeli combat sol-
dier, and we live in Haifa, which is known as 
the city of coexistence. In Haifa, I study and 
work with Arabs and Jews alike. Last week 
our city was hit by a wave of violence by citi-
zens against citizens. Violent extremists have 
roamed the streets terrorizing people and van-
dalizing property. Dear American people, I 
know that you understand how dangerous it is 
to stay silent when you see discrimination, op-
pression, 
and 
violence. 
It 
is 
simply 
unsustainable. We need to move past the sta-
tus quo, so that I can marry my fiance´ instead 
of him going to war, only to return to a broken 
city. 
TASNIM—GAZAN 
My name is Tasnim, and I am a Palestinian 
from Gaza. My family and I left Gaza during 
the 2008 war. Unfortunately, when we moved, 
my sister was separated from her children, 
and they stayed in Gaza. Today, my two 
nieces, lama and Heba, who are young and 
dream of traveling the world, still live in Gaza. 
Since the air strikes have started, we have 
been calling them every single day to check if 
they are still alive. We hear of constant at-
tacks where kids are being buried under the 
rubble of their own houses along with their 
dreams. We are constantly afraid that the next 
time we call them, we will not be able to reach 
them. The fear and stress that come with try-
ing to connect with my family in Gaza is un-
imaginable. 
BAHA—PALESTINIAN FROM THE WEST BANK 
My name is Baha Ebdeir and I am from the 
occupied village of Beit Nattiff, but now I live 
now in Beit Jala. 
This past Ramadan, Israel refused to issue 
permits for Palestinians to observe prayers at 
AI-Aqsa mosque. However, my father was one 
of the few luckiest to be issued a permit for a 
medical appointment he had at the Hospital in 
East Jerusalem. It was not the medical ap-
pointment itself that got my father all excited 
and happy, but the fact that he could use it to 
observe the holiest night of Ramadan, Laylit 
AI-Qadr (The Night of Decree), at AI-Aqsa 
mosque, where our destiny is determined by 
God for the whole year. 
Before he left, my father told us: ‘‘After all, 
I have a permit, what could happen?’’ 
Actually, a lot happened in the two days my 
father spent at AI-Aqsa. 
As the evening went by, an army of Israeli 
soldiers began to increase in number. As soon 
as the Imam uttered Allah Akbar (God is the 
Greatest) to start off the holiest night prayer, 
Israeli soldiers started throwing gas canisters 
at worshipers. As a result of the excessive 
amount of gas my father inhaled, his severe 
coughing continues until today and his eyes 
are as red as blood. 
Usually, my father never shares his fears 
with me, but this time he opened up and I lis-
tened with awe. With every cough, my father 
vividly remembers AI-Aqsa mosque as a war 
zone where Israeli soldiers unapologetically 
shot rubber bullets and threw gas canisters at 
Palestinians for merely being Palestinians. 
Hundreds were injured and many of the elder-
ly lost their lives on the holiest night. 
DORON—JEWISH ISRAELI 
My name is Doron and I am an Israeli, who 
has lived in Jerusalem for the last decade. 
Since 2009, I have participated in peaceful 
protests in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah 
every week. I was touched to see how during 
the recent few months, these protests have 
gained support and momentum in Israel, Pal-
estine and internationally. Suddenly, activists 
in the region and around the world demanded 
justice for the Palestinian residents of Sheikh 
Jarrah, who have been evicted from their 
homes by Jewish Settlers. Unfortunately, ev-
erything was disrupted by the recent esca-
lation, which was orchestrated to undermine 
the local movement in Jerusalem, before it 
was able to achieve any gains. Jerusalem is 
the home of Israelis and Palestinians and it 
should be equal, free and safe for all its inhab-
itants. Residents of Sheikh Jarrah should not 
be afraid to be evicted of their homes at any 
moment. 
MOE—PALESTINIAN FROM THE WEST BANK 
My name is Moe and I am a Palestinian 
from the West Bank, I interned with Congress-
man Jamie Raskin in 2019. 
Seven months ago I got married. This year, 
my wife and I celebrated our first Ramadan to-
gether. We were so excited to celebrate it to-
gether with both our families, but her family 
was unable to travel to see us, because all the 
roads had been closed and settlers have been 
patrolling the streets between the cities ready 
to attack Palestinian travelers. We can’t see 
our family and we can’t travel anywhere. 
I have heard about the danger that awaits 
us if we travel outside of our village and I am 
terrified. I am worried for the safety of my 
three brothers and father, who have jobs that 
require them to travel to Israel. Now, they are 
stuck at home, unable to travel because they 
have been warned that if they try to cross the 
border between the West Bank and Israel, 
their lives would be in danger. 
DIALA—PALESTINIAN CITIZEN OF ISRAEL 
My name is Diala, and I am a Palestinian 
citizen of Israel from Nazareth. 
During the past few weeks, I have protested 
alongside many Palestinian women against 
evictions in the neighbourhood of Sheikh 
Jarrah in Jeruslaem. I am a feminist and I 
strongly believe that the struggle for gender 
equality is deeply connected to this struggle. 
As the police cracked down on us, a group 
of peaceful protestors consisting primarily of 
women, lsraeli supremacy translated into di-
rect violence against Palestinian women. An 
Israeli Police officer kicked me and pushed me 
to the ground. As I lay on the ground, he con-
tinued to kick me aiming at my legs and ribs. 
Throughout my life, I have been told repeat-
edly that I have full and equal rights as a cit-
izen of Israel. However, this week I’ve wit-
nessed the oppressive sexist and racist police 
brutality at play against me and my people. 
Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the first 
casualty of war is the truth. The facts of peo-
ple’s lives are consumed in propaganda. I 
urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of 
young Israelis and Palestinians suffering 
through this brutal violence, ethnic conflict and 
systemic injustice. We owe it to them to call 
openly and loudly on Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and on Hamas to accept an imme-
diate ceasefire and an end to all violence. This

peace and respect for the human rights of all. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. I thank the 
gentleman for his sage recitation. I did 
listen, and I am grateful that the gen-
tleman has seen the need to be a friend 
to persons who are clearly in harm’s 
way. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

SUPPORTING ISRAEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I was 
speaking with my friend, Congressman 
GREEN. And he is my friend. We have 
differences on issues, but he is a broth-
er, and, anyway, it is nice to have 
friends. 
I 
appreciated 
my 
colleague, 
Mr. 
RASKIN, pointing to the violence in the 
Middle East. That is a tremendous 
problem. I am going through a new 
book 
right 
now 
by 
Os 
Guinness, 
‘‘Magna Carta of Humanity,’’ and one 
of the points he makes early on in the 
book is that Christians should take 
note when Jews are under attack. 
When Israel is under attack, Christians 
are going to be next. And Israel should 
take note that when Christians are 
under attack, Israel is going to be next. 
Certainly, in my lifetime, what I 
have seen when the United States 
blesses, does things helpful to Israel, 
we seem to be blessed, and when we be-
tray our ally Israel, we don’t seem to 
be blessed. I have looked for a verse 
like that, that says those who betray 
Israel will be blessed, and I haven’t 
found that one in the Bible. 
The Bible—those of us that have 
looked into the history of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate—is the 
most quoted book in the history of 
Congress in session on the RECORD. So 
it is worth looking to things like that. 
When I said that running for Con-
gress years ago was a calling, a re-
porter asked if I heard voices, I told 
the reporter: ‘‘I wish I heard voices.’’ 
Life would be so much easier if I heard 
an audible voice telling me what to do. 
But since I don’t hear voices, under my 
religious beliefs, I seek wisdom by 
reading the Bible, by praying, and by 
seeking wise counsel. That is what 
some of the leaders of Israel obviously 
have been doing, but they get put into 
a box. 
Four thousand rockets launched into 
Israel from the Gaza Strip, and why are 
there people in the Gaza Strip who 
would do such a thing? It is because 
Israel, in the hopes of peace, made the 
unilateral gesture of giving the Gaza 
Strip, a place where there were so 
many Jewish Israelis living there— 
they had wonderful homes, many had 
greenhouses. They could live there. 
They could provide for their food there. 
Thinking a unilateral gesture would 
be recognized as an ultimate effort at 
true peace, Israel handed over the Gaza 
Strip to Palestinians, and that is not 
necessarily the Palestinian homeland. 
But they handed it over, and it wasn’t 
too long before most of the green-
houses were destroyed and tunnels 
were found. I think 9 miles of tunnels 
have recently been destroyed that were 
being used to smuggle things into 
Israel itself. 
That unilateral effort for peace by 
Israel has ended up being one of the 
worst nightmares for Israel. 
Most days, as I understand it, the 
rockets are launched. They never know 
when they are coming. Children live in 
fear every single day, not knowing if a 
rocket is going to come their way and 
kill them. Parents have to have a safe 
room where, when they hear the siren 
signaling that bombs are coming, they 
have to grab their kids and run to the 
safe room. 
Some years back, when I was in 
Israel and was having a conversation 
with a mom who lived in Israel, and 
they had had many rockets come their 
way, the siren went off. She was in the 
car. There was no safe room to run to. 
So her tiny boy—I think he was 5 or 6— 
she just leaned over and covered him 
with her body in case the car was hit. 
It wasn’t hit. 
When the rocket attack was over, her 
son was really upset and said: ‘‘Mama, 
please don’t ever do that again. If you 
are going to die from a rocket attack, 
I want to die with you.’’ That is some-
thing the Israelis live with every day. 
Rockets are far more sophisticated 
now than they were when the rocket 
attacks first started. But as I have 
pointed 
out 
to 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu before, there has never been 
a time when Israel gave away land try-
ing to buy peace that that land was not 
used as a staging area from which to 
attack Israel. That is the way they are 
rewarded every time they give away 
land that is under their control. 
In the Sinai attacks, they are not 
launching with rockets from there, but 
President el-Sisi told me that there 
were probably more guns per person in 
the Sinai when he took over as Presi-
dent than any other place he was aware 
of. There were so many weapons. Once 
Israel turned that over, it just became 
a place where there were lots of weap-
ons. There were tunnels into Israel. So, 
of course, when there are tunnels that 
allow people to come into Israel with 
weapons, with ways to kill Israelis, 
then the Israelis have to use what is 
known as self-defense. 
As far as our history, I read last year 
that one of the basic goals of BLM was 
to destroy Western-Style families. And 
I shrugged to myself, Western-Style 
families? Those aren’t Western-Style 
families. That came from Moses. Moses 
said it came from God. 
It wasn’t Western civilization-style 
families. It was what Moses said when 
he said a man shall leave his father and 
mother, and a woman will leave her 
home, and the two will become one. 
Then when Jesus was asked about mar-
riage and divorce, he quoted Moses ver-
batim, a man shall leave his father and 
mother, the woman will leave her 
home, the two will become one flesh. 
Then Jesus added a line that Moses had 
not used, and that is when Jesus said, 
and what God has joined together, let 
no one separate or put asunder. Later, 
the Apostle Paul quoted Moses and 
Jesus. 
So knowing all that, when I hear 
BLM wants to destroy Western-Style 
families, they are not Western style. 
They are Mosaic. They are from Moses, 
as confirmed by Jesus. This is the best 
building block for a society, for a civ-
ilization. 
Naturally, if anyone is going to take 
us into a totalitarian government, an 
Orwellian government where—we don’t 
say Big Brother anymore. Orwell called 
it Big Brother, I will say that. But 
now, under the current rules of the 
House, we would say big sibling, big 
sibling totalitarian government with a 
ministry of truth that every day re-
writes history to make the government 
look better. 
Then, of course, they had the Min-
istry of Love, so that if you say any-
thing that is different from what the 
Ministry of Truth said you had to say, 
then you are picked up by the Ministry 
of Love and tortured for hours, days, 
weeks, months, or years until you dis-
claim what you said about the Min-
istry of Truth’s inaccuracy. 
Those are the kinds of things that 
Orwell wrote about in the late 1940s. He 
had been through cancer treatment, so 
some think that is what gave him in-
spiration for the kind of torture that 
the Ministry of Love was putting peo-
ple through. But he went up, as I re-
call, to Scotland and wrote from a 
friend’s home there the book 1984. As I 
have said before, the only thing he ap-
pears to have gotten wrong was the 
year; it wasn’t 1984. But we are seeing 
these tactics. 
We even have people proposing here 
at the Capitol that we should have a 
ministry that specifies exactly what 
truth is, and then anybody that says 
anything different than truth that the 
ministry here or the Federal agency 
here puts out, they should be able to be 
arrested for a crime. And I am like, 
wow, that is right out of Orwell. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. OWENS). I love BURGESS 
OWENS. I am thrilled that he is a Mem-
ber of Congress, and every day I serve 
with him, I am more grateful he is 
here. 
HONORING ROGER MORGAN 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I honor a great man, 
public servant, and Vista Heights Mid-
dle School’s head custodian, Roger 
Morgan, from Saratoga Springs, Utah. 
When COVID–19 disrupted normalcy 
last year, Roger did what he always 
does: He anticipated the needs of oth-
ers and sprang into action.

He installed plexiglass and hand-sani-
tizing stations. He stayed late each 
night to disinfect the entire school. 
During the summer, he cleaned out the 
air vents to increase filtration. 
He was proactive and diligent in fill-
ing PPE from district, State, and 
school funds. As shipments arrived, he 
organized and distributed the supplies. 
When the State of Utah requested a 
rapid testing site at Vista Heights, 
Roger worked overtime to set it up and 
cleaned the units every day to help fa-
cilitate the accessibility of this testing 
option. 
The 
praise 
for 
Roger 
is 
over-
whelming. He is a team player, and he 
represents the Fourth District’s spirit 
of service and compassion. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Roger, 
District Four’s first hometown hero. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, as I 
have told my friend—he wears that big 
shiny Super Bowl ring; he hasn’t let me 
wear it yet—any time he comes to the 
floor, I will always yield to him. I ap-
preciate anything he has to say. 
Having talked with Prime Minister 
Netanyahu on multiple occasions, I 
have very high regard for him. He is in 
such a difficult situation, and I don’t 
think there is anybody who character-
izes the situations that arise in Israel 
better than my friend—hopefully, it 
won’t hurt her for me to say she is a 
friend—but Caroline Glick, just a won-
derful perspective on the things in 
Israel. 
I know they were going through a 
tough time as far as organizing govern-
ment. I hope it works out. But Israel 
needs a strong leader, in my humble 
opinion, 
like 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu because they are under at-
tack. Every time Israel has tried to 
placate people that hate them, it 
hasn’t worked out well. 
In the Gaza Strip, it is controlled by 
Hamas. I bet there is an excellent 
chance that money that the United 
States has sent to Iran, and we know 
money that the U.S. has sent to the 
Palestinians, ends up funding schools 
that teach hate for Jews, to name holi-
days and streets for people that have 
effectively blown up innocent Israelis. 
But it is scary here in the United 
States to hear more and more anti- 
Jewish, anti-Israel rhetoric. That does 
not bode well for the future of the 
United States. 
b 1330 
John Adams had some great writings 
on importance of the Jewish people, 
and the importance of their existence 
to civilization. And there is a good 
chance if you see people that think the 
answer to their problems is blowing up 
innocent people that they hate, they 
are badly mistaken. 
And so, coming back around to Janu-
ary 6, anybody that engaged in vio-
lence here on January 6 should be pun-
ished, and any such violence should not 
be minimized. If I were still a felony 
judge and people that had engaged in 
violence on January 6 here came before 
me, I would have no problem sen-
tencing them. We can’t have that kind 
of conduct. 
And as I and so many of my friends 
have said repeatedly, the most effec-
tive protest is peaceful protest—learn-
ing from the incredible Christian man, 
a Christian minister named Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. The Weather Under-
ground, Bill Ayers’ friends, they tried 
violence. It didn’t work. They didn’t 
accomplish anything. Of course, when 
they started moving into universities 
and getting tenure and teaching chil-
dren to love socialism, they became 
much more effective than those days 
when they were blowing things up try-
ing to kill people. 
But there is so much more to be 
helped by peaceful protest. Make your 
voices heard. And just as the President 
said on January 6, it needs to be peace-
ful, but make your voices heard. 
I would love it if our friends across 
the aisle had been as condemning of 
people in Antifa or BLM that engaged 
in violence, or people that chased my 
wife and I down the street after the 
President’s speech at the White House 
last year. I wish the people on the 
other side of the aisle would condemn 
those things as well. Some of us con-
demn violence on both sides, no matter 
who it is supporting. It is wrong, and 
should be. But it turns out it wasn’t all 
violence here at the Capitol. 
This is an article by Julie Kelly. She 
has probably done greater research and 
reporting about January 6 than any-
body that I have seen. This article 
from May 16 says, ‘‘Video shows U.S. 
Capitol Police gave protestors okay to 
enter.’’ 
Now, we know that there was some 
violence here at the Capitol; there was. 
Of course, it was a Capitol Police that 
shot Ashley Babbitt, killed her, I think 
a Navy veteran—but a military vet-
eran; she was unarmed. But we also 
know that after hearing they were 
armed, that these people came ready to 
shoot Members of Congress, that at 
least for weeks, there was no arrest, no 
charges of anybody in the Capitol for 
having a firearm. 
Some apparently used a flag, a couple 
other things, in an aggressive manner. 
And if they assaulted someone with 
those, they should be severely pun-
ished. But it wasn’t an ‘‘armed,’’ as we 
think of now. Maybe if you were back 
in the 1500s, you would say they were 
armed if they had a little battalion 
like one 18-year old had that stayed in 
jail for weeks and weeks and weeks in 
solitary confinement, 23 hours a day, 
while people that have burned and 
looted and killed in other cities, part of 
Antifa and those protests, even the 
Vice President back then was trying to 
raise bail money for them to help get 
them out. Not so. No help for people 
that were jailed from the January 6 in-
cident. 
And as I understand, there have been 
over 450 arrested, and many of those, it 
has been reported, we had many Fed-
eral agents show up. A couple from 
Alaska had their homes ransacked be-
fore the Federal agents finally accept-
ed the fact that the woman was not the 
woman they had a picture of, who had 
stolen Speaker PELOSI’s laptop. 
You would think as sophisticated as 
law enforcement is now, that our Fed-
eral agents, FBI would have been so-
phisticated enough to know whether 
somebody in the picture was the person 
whose house they were ransacking. But 
then again, FBI, it is the only law en-
forcement entity I am aware of that 
doesn’t like to have any video of state-
ments made by potential defendants. 
They prefer to write their own version 
of what the defendant or target says so 
they are not contradicted by having 
audio or videotape somewhere. 
But in any event, Julie Kelly’s arti-
cle says, ‘‘newly obtained video shows 
United States Capitol police officers 
speaking 
with 
several 
January 
6 
protestors, including Jacob Chansley, 
the so-called Q Shaman, inside the 
Capitol that afternoon.’’ 
One officer identified in the video 
and confirmed by charging documents 
as Officer Keith Robishaw, appears to 
tell Chansley’s group that they won’t 
stop them from entering the building: 
‘‘We are not against, you need to show 
us . . . no attacking, no assault, re-
main calm, Robishaw warns.’’ And 
Chansley 
and 
other 
protestors 
in-
structed the crowd to act peaceful. 
‘‘This has to be peaceful,’’ Chansley 
yelled. ‘‘We have the right to peace-
fully assemble.’’ 
The video directly contradicts what 
government prosecutors alleged in a 
complaint filed January 8 against 
Chansley. In the complaint: ‘‘Robishaw 
and 
other 
officers 
calmed 
the 
protestors somewhat and directed them 
to leave the area from the same way 
they had entered. Chansley approached 
Officer Robishaw and screamed, among 
other things, that this was their House 
and that they were there to take the 
Capitol and to get Congressional lead-
ers.’’ 
Well, that is not on the video. And 
then when you see that, you have Feds 
that have made these allegations in 
writing and actually signed their name 
to them, well, that kind of gives us an 
indication why they don’t want the 
14,000 hours of video that would show 
everything that happened here at the 
Capitol. They don’t want them re-
leased. They are fighting against re-
leasing them. They don’t want people 
to see them, which is a bit unusual be-
cause in the United States, one of the 
points of the revolution was to have an 
open government where you didn’t 
have secret prosecutions and secret 
evidence like the Soviet Union would 
use, like Kafka talked about in his 
book, The Trial. 
And yet, often these days, you will 
have a SWAT team of Federal agents 
swarm and arrest people, like we had a 
hearing some years back. My friend, 
BOBBY SCOTT, Democrat from Virginia, 
and I were both very concerned about 
the civil rights. And we didn’t know

what political party, if any, that these 
people that were being abused claimed, 
but we knew they were being abused 
regardless of race, creed, color. They 
were being abused and the Federal 
process was being abused. And that has 
gone on in Democrat, Republican, 
Democrat, Republican administrations. 
It ought to be a concern to everybody. 
And so, secrecy surrounding January 
6 just should not exist. There is no rea-
son for it. Let everyone see exactly 
what happened. Don’t try to hide the 
facts. Don’t pull an FBI and only give 
us a written account of your interpre-
tation of what was said and done. Let 
us see the video. And don’t edit it. Let 
us see the video. Quit trying to hide 
the 14,000 hours of videotape. Who are 
you trying to hide? Why are you trying 
to hide it? 
Well, this story gives an indication, 
perhaps, why these things would be 
hidden. And, yes, I am extremely con-
servative, but it doesn’t matter who is 
being abused by abusive law officers. 
Truth and justice need to rule out. And 
this raises great concerns. 
So, under the rule of the House, we 
are not allowed to run videotape or 
audiotape, so the best we could do is 
have blowups. This is Mr. Watson—he 
doesn’t look a whole lot like me—but 
Mr. Watson, and it says: ‘‘The police 
here are willing to work with us and 
cooperate peacefully like our First 
Amendment allows.’’ 
And 
the 
video 
reveals 
Officer 
Robishaw, and he is saying, ‘‘We are 
not against—you need to show us . . . 
do you understand. No attacking, no 
assault, remain calm.’’ 
And then you have Mr. Watson, who 
comes back, and he turns to the group 
there and says: ‘‘We are not going to 
assault, we are going to be heard. Ev-
erybody—this must be peaceful.’’ 
So there were people engaging in vio-
lence for which they need to be pun-
ished. And there were people who were 
trying to engage peacefully. And that 
was most of the tens of thousands who 
were outside the Capitol that didn’t 
come into the Capitol, that had been 
down for the President’s speech at the 
other end of Constitution or Pennsyl-
vania Avenue that didn’t even have 
time to get up here to the Capitol be-
fore some folks entered the Capitol. 
So there is a lot that needs to be 
learned, and I hope that we will have 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
who will join us in demanding the re-
lease of the 14,000 hours of videotape. 
There is a story from FOX News that 
a Politico reporter falsely suggests 
U.S. Capitol Police condemned GOP 
lawmakers for opposing the January 6 
commission. That was an anonymous 
letter. We don’t know if it was more 
than one, who it was, were they all 
Capitol Police, was there more than 
one. We don’t know, because it was 
anonymous. And then the Capitol Po-
lice came out and said we are not tak-
ing a position in this whatsoever. 
Now, a New York Post reported—and 
this is Elizabeth Elizalde—she reported 
back January 13 that Mr. Watson was 
out on bond for trafficking marijuana 
and LSD at the time he traveled to 
Washington, D.C. He had been out on 
$103,000 bond on a drug trafficking case. 
Well, that is not somebody that should 
have been leading a protest here in 
Washington. But yet, here he was. And 
even then, he did not want to engage in 
any violence. 
But then, I ran across this story from 
May 7, and I had not seen this story 
until this week. I somehow missed it. 
The lame stream media did not appear 
to be reporting it. It is from The Or-
lando Sentinel, and it is an AP story, 
so I don’t know why more places didn’t 
get the story out there, but it is from 
Tallahassee. 
‘‘A Florida man was convicted Thurs-
day of trying to organize an armed re-
sponse to supporters of former Presi-
dent Donald Trump for an expected 
gathering at the State Capitol in Janu-
ary ahead of Joe Biden’s Presidential 
inauguration. 
‘‘Daniel Alan Baker, 33, of Tallahas-
see, was convicted of two counts of 
transmitting 
a 
communication 
in 
interstate 
commerce 
containing 
a 
threat to kidnap or injure another per-
son. Baker used social media to recruit 
people in a plot to create a circle 
around protestors and trap them in the 
Capitol, according to the FBI. The 
court documents describe what it said 
were a series of threats of violence 
made by Baker, along with a prediction 
of civil war. Baker was described as 
anti-Trump, 
anti-government, 
anti- 
white supremacists, and anti-police. 
b 1345 
Anyway, that is an interesting story 
that I didn’t see played up by the 
media too big. This is an important 
story, and it does need to be addressed. 
Unfortunately, when we talk about 
rules violations, it turns out, on June 
22 of 2016, Republicans in the majority 
were prevented from having an official 
proceeding. I didn’t realize it back 
then, but I knew it violated all kinds of 
House rules, but when Democrat Mem-
bers of Congress took over, and one of 
the Democrat Members grabbed the 
microphone and would not let a Repub-
lican have it. 
Anyway, we were prevented from 
having an official session of Congress, 
and they held the floor, held a sit-in 
down here for over 24 hours. And it 
turns out that a charge that is being 
leveled at some of the people, including 
people who were peacefully here, like 
some of those in Watson’s group who 
actually were here peacefully, they are 
being charged with impeding an official 
proceeding under 18 U.S.C. 1512. 
I didn’t realize it, but when that was 
signed into law before I got here back 
in 2002, it carried a 20-year potential 
sentence for impeding an official pro-
ceeding. It says ‘‘corruptly,’’ which in 
the definition of the statute means 
with intent to keep the official pro-
ceeding from happening. 
So it seems there were many viola-
tions of that criminal law back then. 
Probably the limitations has run out, 
and I am not suggesting we go back 
and arrest people for violating that law 
back in 2016. I am suggesting that when 
people violate the law that are in Con-
gress—not just rules, but actually vio-
late criminal laws—I would hope they 
would be a little less condemning of 
others for violating the same law that 
they did. 
Hopefully, we will see a little more 
bipartisan work. We had friends across 
the aisle saying, gee, the 9/11 Commis-
sion was completely bipartisan, both 
sides worked together well and wanted 
to get to the bottom of it. But it was 
clear the way the January 6 commis-
sion was being set up, where Democrats 
pick all of the staff, that this is not 
going to be a fair situation. It is not 
going to work out like the 9/11 Com-
mission because this is a different 
time. I never thought I would see times 
like this when we really do have dif-
ferent goals. 
Some in this body will condemn 
Israel for defending themselves like 
they have, and not say one word about 
the rockets—the 4,000 rockets that 
have flown and killed innocent Israelis. 
And I know there are people in the 
United States who say there is no such 
thing as an innocent Israeli, we need to 
wipe them all out, we need to kill 
every one of them, the area from the 
river to the sea should be free of Jews. 
That gets really scary when people in 
America say that, feel that, because 
that really falls right into the same 
type of things that were being said in 
the 1930s in Europe, and we know what 
that led to. 
As Barney Fife used to say, that 
needs to be nipped in the bud. That 
needs to be stopped. It is getting dan-
gerous not just for this country, but for 
all of civilization. 
There are people who want anarchy, 
including Antifa. There are people 
within Antifa who that is what they 
want. And then there are people who 
are Marxists, socialists, and BLM, 
their ultimate goal is to create a Marx-
ist government. 
It is interesting, because Marx was so 
wrong about so much. He just missed 
it. He totally missed the idea that you 
could have a middle class that would be 
the real strength in a country, as it has 
been in the United States. He thought 
it was going to be a class revolution, 
that the workers of the world would 
unite and rebel against that small thin 
veneer of a ruling class. 
He didn’t foresee that the real rulers 
would be the middle class. But as this 
country has progressed, we have seen 
billionaires arise, who think they are 
above the law; who think that, gee, if 
we move into a totalitarian govern-
ment, they will be part of that thin ve-
neer of a ruling class. 
Unfortunately, though, they are bril-
liant in business, creating monopolies 
and making billions of dollars, even 
though some don’t even pay their 
workers enough that they can avoid 
food stamps. But they don’t know

enough about history. They don’t know 
enough about Marxist movements. Be-
cause, sure, people who want a totali-
tarian, Marxist, socialist system, they 
are glad to have that money. $500 mil-
lion to help in the Democrat effort to 
win the last election by just one of 
those oligarchs, they are glad to have 
that money. 
But history tells us that if the Marx-
ists take over, the first thing they do is 
take all that money. 
Do you think BERNIE SANDERS is kid-
ding about his disgust at billionaires? 
No. They will take your money. They 
will use it to win. And then after they 
win, they will take your money and 
you will either go to a Gulag or you are 
put to death. They are not going to 
leave billionaires around to manage 
things. They will take your money and 
you will go the way, as so many Sovi-
ets did. I hope they wake up in time to 
realize. 
But Marx was so wrong. Why are peo-
ple following him? He was proven 
wrong in the Soviet Union. He was 
proven wrong in Venezuela. 
And then along came Gramsci. Back 
in the 1940s, he was put in Italian jail. 
He figured out, okay, Marx had it 
wrong; we can’t get our revolution and 
overthrow Democratic Republic, like 
here in the United States, by having 
the middle class unite and overthrow 
the most wealthy. 
The only way to get it done in a 
place like that is not workers of the 
world unite, but it is to go into institu-
tions and create an institutional war 
where you take over institutions. You 
pit institution against institution. You 
go to war against the culture. That is 
what we are seeing in America. That is 
what is being utilized. 
Things like the family, no matter 
how many studies repeatedly show that 
the best odds for a child to be very suc-
cessful is to come from a two-parent 
family and a well-grounded family. 
That is it. That is the best chance to 
succeed in life. Thank God, there are so 
many of the most important people in 
the history of the United States who 
have come from single-mom families, 
single-parent families. But the odds are 
best if it is a traditional family, like 
Moses, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul 
talked about. 
And I will never forget a murder trial 
of the leader of a gang, over which I 
presided as judge. He didn’t testify on 
the merits of the case. He was charged 
with murder. He murdered a Hispanic 
friend, but he thought that this guy 
had ratted him out to the police. He 
was convicted of killing this guy. 
As people testified during the trial on 
the merits of guilt or innocence, they 
were disparaging his gang and the gang 
members, and the violence in which 
they were engaged. So once he was con-
victed, his attorney, smartly and wise-
ly, advised his client not to testify on 
sentencing, because once you start tes-
tifying, as I warned him outside the 
presence of the jury, you waive your 
right to remain silent. 
At that point, once you waive your 
right to remain silent, you are subject 
to cross-examination. You do have to 
answer the questions that are relevant 
and material. And you if you don’t, you 
can be put in jail and kept in jail for 
not answering those questions. 
He understood all of that and he went 
against the advice of his attorney. He 
explained the reason he had to get up 
there and testify. He sat through the 
whole trial hearing people talk badly 
about his gang members, and it was an 
emotional thing to him. 
He told us, everybody in the court-
room, that he was sick of hearing the 
gang members being called names, 
being accused of things. And he said: 
They are the only family I ever had. 
They are my family. 
He didn’t have a father, that he knew 
of. His mother was working and she 
was gone much of the time. And, as he 
said, that gang was his family. 
And I was thinking, that is what hap-
pens when you have a war on poverty 
that starts by bribing families to get 
the father out of the home. Now, I 
know that was not the intent. The in-
tent was to help single moms, but the 
effect of the Federal Government pay-
ing people to not have fathers in the 
home, going back to the mid-60s, has 
changed this society, has eliminated 
fathers from the lives of children, and 
has prevented many from getting the 
education that was once so highly 
sought in America. 
When my youngest daughter was 
going into high school, one of the high 
school leaders, employees there, indi-
cated that about 40 percent of her class 
would not graduate and would drop out 
of school. I couldn’t believe those num-
bers. Forty percent in Tyler, Texas, 
will not likely graduate and drop out of 
school. 
You can’t maintain an advanced soci-
ety when 40 percent of a generation are 
not learning to read and write, and 
they are not finishing even a secondary 
education. You can’t maintain a soci-
ety like that. 
b 1400 
We are doomed unless we get that 
turned around. That is still the case if 
we don’t get this turned around, where 
they get a better education. 
People will say: Well, more Federal 
Government is the answer. 
It hasn’t been. Back when the States 
and local government were totally in 
charge of the education of students 
through high school, we had a higher 
percentage graduating back then. They 
were doing better on tests back then. 
I remember in the early nineties—I 
believe that is when it was—that there 
was a report that SAT scores had been 
getting lower than they were back in 
the seventies, when I took the SAT. So 
they had made an adjustment in the 
scoring of the SAT so that the scores 
appeared to be better. 
Back then, I asked the president at 
Texas A&M, when I was down there on 
the board of directors of the former 
student association: When they ad-
justed the scoring of the SAT, what did 
that do? 
He said: Well, there was a formula so 
you can’t say it added a specific num-
ber of points, but, on average, it prob-
ably added 200 points or so to the cur-
rent takers of this SAT scores. 
Also, that it wouldn’t look so bad 
since the Federal Government basi-
cally started telling the States and 
local governments what to do about 
education. So apparently we were 
doing better back in the late sixties 
and seventies on our SATs until the 
Federal 
Government 
got 
more 
in-
volved. We were doing better on our 
SATs until President Carter created a 
Department of Education. 
When I took it, I did very well. It got 
me into the honors program at Texas 
A&M. I am sure that shocks people who 
think that I am the dumbest guy in 
Congress. I was part of the honors pro-
gram, and that was really nice. About 
150 of the best scores on the SAT of the 
class of about 3,500, I think we were. 
But how in the world do students not 
get as educated after we create a Fed-
eral Department of Education that 
starts dictating what students have to 
do to be educated? 
It sounds like maybe we need to get 
back to the 10th Amendment observa-
tion that those powers not specifically 
enumerated in the Constitution are re-
served to the States and people. It 
seemed like perhaps the best education 
control is local control, where the par-
ents can be more hands-on. 
But I understand when, at the same 
time, the Federal Government is pay-
ing to have only a single parent and 
not paying for two parents to be in the 
home that the studies were right. It 
helps to have a two-parent home to in-
crease the odds of success for the chil-
dren. 
We are having a hearing that I left. I 
had finished my part in the hearing 
and came over here. But it is on guns 
and discussions about mass gun shoot-
ings that break your heart. Innocent 
people. There seem to be so many more 
now. 
But if you are going to have Weather 
Underground 
people 
in 
universities 
teaching that there is no right, there is 
no wrong, it is all relative; if you are 
going to have people teaching there is 
no God, there is no ultimate source of 
right, wrong, and justice; if you are 
going to be teaching that, then you are 
going to have what our Founders would 
have called an immoral and an irreli-
gious people. 
John Adams was a fan of the Con-
stitution, although there were lots of 
bitter fights. Back in those days, they 
could yell, they could fuss, and they 
could do like we do. I fussed at friends 
across the aisle, and I really like them. 
I just think they are wrong on some 
things. It doesn’t keep me from liking 
them if we disagree. But as he said, 
‘‘this Constitution is intended for a 
moral and religious people; it is wholly 
inadequate for the government of any 
other.’’

He is right. 
We have a Second Amendment right 
to keep and bear arms, and it is not to 
be infringed upon by the Federal Gov-
ernment or the State Government. But 
the problem is when we quit teaching 
about right and wrong; when we start-
ed preventing the greatest, most pur-
chased book in the history of the 
world, the Bible, from being utilized in 
schools, then it created a vacuum, it 
created a void. And that was filled by 
people who were a bit hedonistic and 
began teaching that there is no ulti-
mate right or wrong. 
C.S. Lewis talked about he was proud 
to be an atheist. Or you could say ag-
nostic, Mr. Speaker. He just didn’t be-
lieve there was any way to determine 
that there really was a God. He used to 
like to goad people who would say they 
were Christians: Well, tell me, if there 
is a good God, how can there be so 
much injustice in the world? 
No matter what they said, especially 
these debates he would have with other 
Oxford professors or students when 
they would try to explain why there 
was a good God even though there was 
so much injustice, he would come back 
and say: Yes, that is all well and good, 
but wouldn’t it be easier just to say 
there is no such thing as a good God? 
One day he realized, how could he 
possibly say there was injustice in the 
world if there was not somewhere some 
absolute source of right and wrong and 
justice and injustice? 
Because, as he said, it would be like 
a man blind from birth trying to de-
scribe light. You can’t describe justice 
if there isn’t an ultimate source of fair-
ness and justice. And that ultimate 
source put a little of that in every 
heart. 
Some develop calluses. It is kind of 
like the olfactory. I have read that 
that is supposed to be the most sen-
sitive sense, the best memory of any of 
our senses. I think Mr. Science or 
somebody was explaining one day on 
television that the olfactory nerves are 
a bit like a cup. Those cells fill up with 
a smell, and it is like filling up a cup 
with water. Once it fills up, you can’t 
detect that there is more water out 
there because it is full. The olfactory, 
once it is full of a smell, it quits de-
tecting the smell is there. 
It is the same way when we are 
around evil or wrongdoing long enough. 
I saw it as a judge many times. Moth-
ers would say: Hey, don’t hang around 
with those people, they are bad news. 
And they would hang around with 
them. And when I would sentence 
them, they would say: My mother said 
I shouldn’t be hanging out with these 
guys; I did, and it ruined my life. 
Mr. Speaker, if you hang around with 
evil long enough, then you quit notic-
ing the good. That has happened for 
too many people. They didn’t have 
families and they didn’t have churches 
and institutions that they were part of 
that taught them there is a right and 
wrong. 
Once C.S. Lewis realized there has to 
be some source of absolute right and 
wrong, then he realized there has to be 
a God, and then he went from there to 
becoming a Christian. As he said, just 
because there are different degrees of 
recognition and appreciation for jus-
tice doesn’t mean that there isn’t an 
absolute source of justice. He said that 
it is like music. Some people come 
closer to hitting the right note than 
others. It doesn’t mean the music 
doesn’t exist. 
But in this country, we had that as a 
solid basis. Our founding was not about 
1619 or 1620. The Pilgrims didn’t come 
over because of slavery. They came 
over for freedom of religion, as a place 
where Christians would not be per-
secuted. Despite different denomina-
tions battling and interdenominational 
battles, people, for most of our history, 
have not been persecuted for being 
Christians. 
Until recently, we didn’t see a lot of 
anti-Semitism in the United States, 
but it is growing. As my friend, BRAD 
SHERMAN, was pointing out, it is alarm-
ing to see the anti-Semitism growing 
in violence, as the event out in Cali-
fornia. 
So I hope that we can come back to 
a place where people who may have 
violated the impeding and official pro-
ceeding, as happened January 22, 2016, 
will be a little more understanding of 
people engaged in peaceful protest, who 
didn’t and wouldn’t engage in violence. 
We will agree on the violence: they 
need to be punished. But I hope that we 
can work together to advance this 
country to the point where there is 
fairness, there is justice, and we are 
not going to discriminate against peo-
ple because of the color of their skin. 
We will be a colorblind society. 
Dr. King had a dream, and people are 
turning it into a nightmare. Let’s get 
back to his dream and make it happen 
so that he can be the luminary that 
God intended him to be. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
TWO-TRACK JUSTICE SYSTEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to address the two- 
track justice system here in the United 
States. 
If you are part of the Democrat-spon-
sored and Democrat terrorist organiza-
tions BLM and Antifa, then you can 
burn down American cities for an en-
tire year, get bailed out of jail, and 
face no investigation or commission 
from Congress. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, if you are a 
Trump supporter who happened to be 
at the Capitol on January 6, then you 
face exorbitant bail, solitary confine-
ment, abuse of jail guards, and no due 
process. 
This is an outrage. Just today, just 
this week, Congress told all of the 
American citizens that Congress cares 
more about Congress than the Amer-
ican people. After all, we have wit-
nessed American cities all over our 
country be victims to violent riots by 
domestic terrorists all over this coun-
try. 
The people have endured this. Busi-
nesses have been destroyed. Violence 
has happened. Police officers, night 
after night, have been abused and have 
had to endure these violent riots and 
attacks, on and on. 
Yet this institution has been focused 
on itself and focused on investigating 
January 6, even though there are many 
investigations already happening here 
through the Senate and the House com-
mittees. There have already been over 
445 people arrested from January 6. 
There are also more than 100 to be ar-
rested soon. There is justice happening 
for the riot here at the Capitol on Jan-
uary 6. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, 
to-
gether, are against the violence and 
the riot that happened here in the Cap-
itol on January 6, but the problem lies 
with this: Republicans and Democrats 
are not together on the violence that 
has happened to the people all over this 
country throughout the past year. 
That is why Congress is only con-
cerned with itself and not about the 
American people. 
b 1415 
Rioters did a horrific and jaw-drop-
ping amount of damage to cities across 
America. During 2020, there was up to 
$2 billion in damage due to the riots 
that swept the Nation, the most expen-
sive in insurance history. 
By the way, that is not a $2 billion 
bailout fund coming from the govern-
ment. That is not a taxpayer-funded 
check. That is private money. That is 
private money that insurance compa-
nies are having to pay because domes-
tic terrorists rioted. 
The damage done to Federal build-
ings has been incredibly costly. BLM 
rioters in Nashville set a Federal 
courthouse on fire. The destruction is 
estimated to have cost $1.2 million in 
damages. This is a courthouse. Why 
were those involved attacking and set-
ting fire to this courthouse not called 
insurrectionists? It is a question that 
needs to be asked. 
Rioters in Portland destroyed bar-
riers and attempted to burn down gov-
ernment buildings, costing $1.6 million 
in damage to the Federal courthouse 
downtown. Why is this not called an in-
surrection? And, again, why is Con-
gress not concerned with creating a 
commission for this type of damage 
and the people who caused this attack? 
In Guilford County, North Carolina, a 
courthouse was broken into and set on 
fire, resulting in roughly $200,000 in 
damages. Again, it is a courthouse. 
Why is that not called an insurrection? 
And there is not a government bailout 
and a commission in place to inves-
tigate these things. 
Los Angeles, Oakland, Louisville, and 
Dakota City also had damage to Fed-
eral buildings. These cities are not

being named. Members of Congress are 
not demanding a commission to inves-
tigate the damages happening to the 
Federal buildings in these cities. No 
one is being called insurrectionists for 
the damage that is done to these Fed-
eral buildings. 
As a matter of fact, most of the time, 
if you watch the news, they are called 
peaceful protesters. These are not 
peaceful protests. These are violent do-
mestic acts of terror, and this is ex-
actly how they should be viewed, and 
this is how they should be handled. 
The looting, burning, and destruction 
across America have cost cities mil-
lions and millions of dollars. Riots 
caused an estimated $55 million in 
damages in Minneapolis alone. Min-
neapolis city officials estimate 700 
buildings were damaged, burned or de-
stroyed, including, in one estimation, 
360 local businesses. But I have an arti-
cle right here that contains a list of 
1,500 businesses that were damaged or 
destroyed—1,500 businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, it is these businesses 
and these business owners that pay the 
taxes that fund everything that we do 
here. These people should matter. 
Their businesses should matter. Why is 
there not a commission investigating 
this? Why doesn’t Congress care about 
these people and their businesses? 
Rioters in Portland set up an autono-
mous zone that ultimately cost the 
city $2.3 million in damages—an auton-
omous zone. What is an autonomous 
zone, and how can people take over 
part of a city, an American city, and 
say that it is theirs, and that they con-
trol it, and that no government author-
ity can come in and enforce the law, 
enforce law and order in this part of 
the city? 
Yet, this is what happened with 
peaceful protesters in Portland. They 
created an autonomous zone, costing 
the taxpayers of Portland $2.3 million 
in damages. Again, that was not a bail-
out fund. Those are people’s actual dol-
lars, private citizens’ dollars. 
Riots in New York are estimated to 
have cost the city $115 million. One 
Friday 
night 
alone 
cost 
the 
city 
$100,000 and resulted in the arrest of 150 
rioters. That was just in one night, the 
arrest of 150 rioters. It is unbelievable. 
Riots in Salt Lake City cost at least 
$100,000 in damages. 
Riots in Wichita, Kansas, cost the po-
lice department nearly $1.5 million in 
overtime because they had to work. 
They had to show up for another shift 
when they were exhausted from work-
ing the shift before. So, they had to be 
paid overtime because they were over-
run with rioters. 
Riots in Denver cost the city at least 
$5.5 million in damages and overtime. 
This is unbelievable, when there are 
antifa, BLM rioters, domestic terror-
ists causing so much violence and dam-
age in a city that these cities and po-
lice departments are having to call 
their police officers back in after work-
ing their shifts, their long hours: No, I 
am sorry. You can’t go home to your 
family. I am sorry, you can’t go home 
and do things that you need to do in 
your regular life. We need you to come 
in. We need you to come back and work 
overtime because our city is overrun 
with violence. 
Yet, here the United States Congress, 
the 117th Congress, has no interest in 
launching a commission to investigate, 
to stop these incredibly organized and 
well-funded 
organizations 
of 
terror 
across American cities and the country 
that are causing private citizens, busi-
nesses, insurance companies, cities, 
counties, and States so much money 
that all comes from American citizens 
and taxpayers. 
Money is not created right here in 
Congress. This is not a facility. This is 
not an institution that creates rev-
enue. The only revenue that Congress 
operates on is the American people’s 
tax dollars that they have to pay right 
here to the Federal Government. Con-
gress needs to learn to put the people 
first and not itself. 
Riots in Baltimore cost the city an 
estimated $26 million—again, taxpayer 
dollars, privacy citizens’ dollars. 
Riots in Kansas City resulted in $2.1 
million in damages, most over the 
course of just one weekend. That is 
some kind of party, isn’t it, where 
antifa and BLM terrorists can go out 
and just riot in violence and rage in 
one weekend, costing a city $2.1 mil-
lion? 
Rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in-
jured police officers and set at least 
two city trucks on fire. Altogether, the 
destruction cost the city $50 million. 
Does anyone understand what $50 mil-
lion is? That is an exorbitant amount 
of money in damages for people who 
were angry and think that it is okay to 
riot and destroy other people’s prop-
erty, other people’s businesses, and 
tear down a community. There is no 
excuse for that. 
Here we have California, where they 
closed down all of its State buildings in 
downtown areas, saying staff should 
not report to work for any reason. That 
sounds like some kind of Third World 
country where you have California 
closing down all of its State buildings 
in downtown areas saying that your 
staff should not report to work for any 
reason. Why? Because it is too dan-
gerous for you. 
Yet, this Congress is so concerned 
with spending an unknown amount of 
money on a January 6 commission 
when there are already multiple inves-
tigations underway. There have al-
ready been 445 arrests made, 100 more 
to take place. Yet, this Congress is not 
concerned about all the violence and 
the organizations that caused all of 
this to the point where California has 
to say: Don’t come to work. It is dan-
gerous. 
Look at this. It is unreal. This is our 
country. The police officers who defend 
Americans paid a great price as well, 
just like the Capitol Police officers 
here in the Capitol did. The police offi-
cers all over the country in American 
cities, it didn’t just happen to them on 
one day for part of the day. It happened 
to them night after night, day after 
day, continuously. 
In some cities, for a short time, 
weeks, but in some cities, it was 
months and months, and it still con-
tinues. The Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation found that between May 25 and 
July 31, there were 8,700 protests na-
tionwide. How many was there on Jan-
uary 6? One. 
Nearly 600 of those protests were de-
clared riots with violence and criminal 
acts, and 2,385 looting incidents were 
reported. Six hundred of them were de-
clared violent riots, 2,385 looting inci-
dents. Again, how many times did that 
happen here at the Capitol? We will go 
with one riot. 
But this Congress is more interested 
in spending an unknown amount of 
money to investigate one riot here be-
cause this Congress seems to only care 
about itself and not the American peo-
ple. 
Three-quarters of law enforcement 
agencies reported officers harmed dur-
ing the protests—three-quarters of law 
enforcement agencies. Why don’t we 
hear about them over and over on the 
news? Does no one care about those po-
lice officers’ lives? Apparently not. 
This Congress obviously doesn’t. 
More than 624 arsons were reported, 
and at least 97 police vehicles were 
burned. That cost a lot of money. 
Again, do you know whose money that 
is? It is the taxpayers’ dollars. The tax-
payers did nothing wrong to deserve 
these riots in their cities, and the po-
lice officers that did a good job and do 
a good job every day don’t deserve it 
either—just because of the actions of a 
few bad apples. 
The MCCA reported that over 2,000 
law enforcement officers were injured 
in these 9 weeks alone. That is why I 
introduced H.R. 2446 to award police all 
over the country who defended Amer-
ican cities. They deserve medals be-
cause no one is acknowledging what 
they have gone through, night after 
night, day after day, with what CNN 
calls peaceful protests. I don’t think 
so. 
Meanwhile, BLM and antifa domestic 
terrorists are bailed out and supported 
by our now-Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS. George Floyd died on May 25 in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. As you see 
here, on June 1, we have then-Senator 
KAMALA HARRIS and then-Vice Presi-
dential candidate for the United States 
sharing, tweeting, a link to the Min-
nesota Freedom Fund encouraging peo-
ple, if you are able, chip in now. Chip 
in now. Send some more money to the 
Minnesota Freedom Fund to help post 
bail for those protesting on the ground 
in Minnesota. 
But we know what was going on. 
These were not protests. These were 
violent riots. I am sorry, you can’t 
stand in front of a city on fire and peo-
ple fighting and say it is a protest. It is 
a riot, and it is not peaceful.

May 20, 2021 
In fact, KAMALA HARRIS, and unfortu-
nately, my own colleague from Min-
neapolis, ILHAN
OMAR, have shared 
links to the Minnesota Freedom Fund 
with their millions of Twitter fol-
lowers. And it raised a lot of money for 
the Minnesota Freedom Fund. In Au-
gust, the Minnesota Freedom Fund re-
ported that it had raised $35 million in 
donations. 
Yes, when the Democratic candidate 
for the Vice President of the United 
States says donate to the Minnesota 
Freedom Fund, people donated. When 
the Congresswoman from Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, shared on her Twitter to 
millions of followers and pointed down, 
meaning follow suit, donate, guess 
what? They raised $35 million. 
b 1430 
And guess what happened from that. 
As a result of all the money raised by 
then-Senator KAMALA HARRIS and then 
the Democrat Vice Presidential can-
didate of the United States, now our 
current Vice President, and current 
Congresswoman 
from 
Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, 
184 
domestic 
terrorist 
criminals that rioted were bailed out 
from the Minnesota Freedom Fund. 
The criminals they helped bail out 
include a woman who shot at the 
SWAT team; another woman, who was 
accused of killing her own friend; and a 
convicted rapist. That is just a few of 
the people that were bailed out with 
the money raised directly for the Min-
nesota Freedom Fund by then-Senator 
KAMALA
HARRIS
and Congresswoman 
ILHAN OMAR, shared on their own Twit-
ter pages. 
Can you imagine if a Republican Con-
gresswoman or Congressman or a Re-
publican 
Senator 
or 
a 
Republican 
President shared a bail bond link and 
said: ‘‘Bail out the protestors from 
January 6’’? Can you imagine the re-
sult of that? It would be unreal. 
There has been no backlash, there 
has been no consequences, there has 
been no action taken from this irre-
sponsibility, supporting domestic ter-
rorists who are responsible for vio-
lence, crime, and costing the innocent 
American people an exorbitant amount 
of money, stress, ruining communities, 
ruining people’s livelihoods, and tear-
ing apart our country. No account-
ability whatsoever. 
These Democrat lawmakers have also 
voted for defunding police departments 
across the country. So while they also 
raised money for domestic terrorists, 
who committed crimes, to be bailed 
out of jail, at the same time they legis-
late and vote to defund police. 
H.R. 1280, that they voted for and 
passed, removed qualified immunity. 
That means police officers can be sued 
if someone is upset with them for their 
actions on the job. 
Police officers don’t make a lot of 
money. They can’t afford big attorney 
bills. It will ruin them, just because 
someone may get their feelings hurt 
because they got arrested. 
H.R. 1280 also will allow police offi-
cers to be put on a list. That means 
whether it is proven or unproven, 
someone can accuse a police officer of 
doing some sort of wrong, and their 
name and information gets put on a 
public list that the Department of Jus-
tice will manage on a website that is 
open to anyone that wants to look it 
up. Founded or unfounded, their ac-
tions, no matter if it is true or not, 
their name goes on this list and what 
they are being accused of. This is what 
these people voted for to do to police 
officers and remove a lot of their fund-
ing. 
After the LAPD was defunded by $150 
million, Vice President HARRIS said: ‘‘I 
applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what 
he has done.’’ 
As a result of the funding cuts, the 
LAPD dissolved its sexual assault unit. 
Defunding the LAPD where they have 
to get rid of the sexual assault unit? 
That 
is 
unbelievable. 
That 
means 
women, children, any victim of sexual 
assault—I am sorry, there is not a unit 
there anymore to help them, because 
they have been defunded. 
As a result of this defunding, Vice 
President 
HARRIS
applauds 
Eric 
Garcetti for doing what he has done, 
there has been a 73 percent spike in 
shootings in LA. When you defund the 
police, ladies and gentlemen, there are 
direct consequences. That means crime 
goes up. 
There has also been a 200 percent 
higher murder rate than last year at 
the same time. If you don’t fund law 
enforcement, you are funding crimi-
nals. Clearly, we can see this is what 
some of these Democrat lawmakers 
have done; they have clearly funded 
criminals and defunded the police. 
Back to Minneapolis and the riots 
there. 
Notice that this date, 11/4/20, that is 
not too long ago, encouraging dona-
tions. There is no excuse for that. No-
vember 4, 2020, by that date, we had 
seen plenty of violence and damage all 
over the streets. There was no way to 
call those riots peaceful protests. We 
know exactly what they are: domestic 
acts of terror. 
In Congresswoman ILHAN OMAR’s dis-
trict, 700 buildings were damaged, 
burned, or destroyed. Who owns those 
buildings? Mostly private citizens. 
1,500 businesses. Here is the list. It is 
reported from the Star Tribune from 
Minneapolis, for the Twin Cities. 1,500 
privately 
owned 
businesses 
heavily 
damaged, two destroyed, mostly com-
pletely destroyed. 
The problem with Congress is, Con-
gress does not get up early every single 
day, go into its business and have to 
earn the money that keeps it going. 
Congress does not have to work so 
hard, lose sleep at night, to figure out 
how to earn the money to keep the 
doors open to their business. Congress 
does not have to lose sleep at night 
when things get rough, like when the 
Government shuts down the economy 
because of a Chinese virus and tells 
businesses that they cannot keep their 
doors open and sell their goods and 
services, that they cannot earn a liv-
ing. You see, Congress doesn’t under-
stand how hard it is to figure out how 
to keep paying your employees when 
that happens to you. 
Congress doesn’t understand or seem 
to care about doing a commission for 
the people that pay the taxes to keep 
the lights on in this building, to care 
about them and why they were vio-
lently attacked. No, Congress only 
cares about itself and why it was at-
tacked on January 6, even though 
there are multiple investigations going 
on, even though there has been 445 peo-
ple arrested and 100 people more ar-
rested. 
And justice should be served for 
those that committed violence here at 
the Capitol on January 6, but Congress 
doesn’t care about the American people 
who have suffered this entire year, and 
it is despicable. 
The human cost of a year of riots and 
violence is 25 American lives lost. That 
has been estimated. Twenty-five Amer-
icans are dead as a direct result of 
BLM and antifa terrorism that has 
swept our Nation. 
I will go ahead and tell you about 
one. 
This little girl’s name is Secoriea 
Turner. Secoriea Turner was killed at a 
Wendy’s in Atlanta, because there were 
riots going on. Secoriea Turner’s moth-
er was pulling in the Wendy’s, turning 
around, trying to go the right way, 
when gunshots were fired that took 
Secoriea Turner’s life. She was 8 years 
old. This little girl was 8 years old and 
was murdered during a riot. 
There is not a commission being 
launched in here for her life. There is 
also not a commission being launched 
for the life of David Dorn, a great man, 
a retired police officer who was mur-
dered during domestic terrorists, BLM, 
riots. Why does Congress not care 
about David Dorn? Why does Congress 
not care about Secoriea Turner? 
Despite all of this damage, there is 
no investigation into domestic ter-
rorism from Congress. We have no com-
mission launched to investigate the 
funding of antifa. There is no inves-
tigation into the funding of BLM. 
There is no commission set forward for 
the past year of violent riots. But all 
they care about is a commission for the 
one riot here on January 6. 
The accused on January 6 have been 
abused behind bars; they have been de-
nied due process rights; they are still 
being held in jail. Michael Sherwin, an 
attorney for D.C., bragged that they 
had rounded up 400 people who partici-
pated in the breach of the Capitol on 
January 6. He said he wanted to charge 
as many people as possible. 
What kind of justice system do we 
have if officials are eager to charge as 
many people as possible, but they don’t 
care about antifa domestic terrorists 
and they don’t care about the people in 
those riots? 
The Biden administration has taken 
investigators who typically work on 
cases involving drug trafficking and

child pornography and assigned them 
to calling relatives, even ex-girlfriends, 
of the January 6 accused in an attempt 
to find them guilty. 
Please put them back on drug traf-
ficking and child pornography. These 
departments are being defunded any-
way. 
One person accused faces 7 years in 
prison for walking through the open 
doors of the Capitol, taking photos in 
the hallway, and leaving without doing 
any harm. 
Even the mainstream media outlets 
have reported on D.C. jail guards cru-
elly beating Trump supporters. One 
man was beaten so badly he has a skull 
fracture and is now blind in one eye. 
You don’t hardly hear anything about 
that on the news. 
Months after January 6, men and 
women are still being held in jail, and 
they haven’t seen their day in court. 
Justice should be served for January 6, 
but this Congress needs to care about 
the people of the United States who 
have not seen justice for the riots of 
the past year. This Congress is failing 
the American people. 
Not only are we a Nation nearly in

watching nation and world look at the 
unfolding of Your prevailing provi-
dence. May our Senators strive to walk 
with integrity, staying on the path

MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 3233 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the bill by title 
for a second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3233) to establish the National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule XIV, I 
would object to further proceedings. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
f 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
January 6 was only a few months ago. 
The memory is still fresh for all of us 
who experienced it firsthand. 
A violent mob stormed the citadel of 
democracy, assaulted our Capitol po-
lice, and tried to halt the peaceful 
transfer of power. One hundred forty 
officers 
were 
injured. 
Five 
people 
would eventually lose their lives in 
connection to the attack. 
I was within 20 feet of these hooli-
gans. 
It was one of the darkest moments in 
American democracy—the first time 
the Capitol was breached since the War 
of 1812, over 200 years ago. And yet, not 
5 months later, many on the Repub-
lican side are trying to whitewash 
what happened. 
Here is what one Senate Republican 
said about the attack last night: ‘‘By 
and large, it was peaceful protests . . . 
except for a few agitators,’’ he said. 
‘‘Even calling this an insurrection’’ 
was wrong. 
If there was ever a justification for 
creating a bipartisan Commission to 
study and report on the truth behind 
the attack of January 6, the comments 
of that Senator provide it. 
Republicans in both Chambers are 
trying to rewrite history in fealty to or 
in fear of the former President, Donald 
Trump. Republicans in both Chambers 
are trying to erase the memory of Jan-
uary 6 and perpetuate the Big Lie. 
They are now likening the mob on Jan-
uary 6 to a group of ‘‘normal tourists.’’ 
Anyone who has seen the pictures of 
them breaking through the Capitol 
barriers knows that these weren’t nor-
mal tourists. 
They are calling the mob, not the po-
lice, the victims of the attack. We have 
dead and injured police officers, and 
they are calling the mob the victims? 
Only a week ago, the House Repub-
licans fired Congresswoman CHENEY for 
the crime of merely repeating the 
truth about the election. It certainly 
wasn’t about policy. Congresswoman 
CHENEY voted with President Trump 
far more than the Member who re-
placed her. She was fired because she 
stood up to the Big Lie. It was a Thom-
as More moment here in 2020, and all of 
the shameful comments by Republicans

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3174 
May 20, 2021 
reveal that a bipartisan Commission is 
even more necessary than it once was. 
We always needed to look into it, but 
the fact that there is such denial, there 
is such lying, and there is such obei-
sance to Donald Trump’s Big Lie and 
to his fundamentally dishonest person-
ality, makes the need for the truth, for 
a Commission greater than it ever has 
been. For the sake of our democracy, it 
is crucial to end the poison of the Big 
Lie, to establish an independent and 
trusted record of what transpired, and 
to make sure an event like January 6 
never, never happens again. 
Yesterday, the House of Representa-
tives passed legislation establishing 
just such a Commission with a strong 
bipartisan vote. Thirty-five Repub-
licans joined Democrats in approving 
the measure, defying their leadership, 
who turned tail at the eleventh hour in 
an act of utter spinelessness. 
Last night and now—just now—I 
began the rule XIV process that would 
make this legislation available for con-
sideration on the floor of the Senate. I 
just moved to place the legislation for 
a Commission on the floor under rule 
XIV. It is my intention to bring the bi-
partisan legislation for the January 6 
Commission up for a vote. 
My Senate Republican colleagues 
must now ask themselves: Are they 
going to join us in pursuing the truth 
or are they going to cover for Donald 
Trump and his Big Lie? I understand 
the Republican leader has decided to 
oppose the bill. The Republican leader, 
who called the January 6 attack a ‘‘dis-
grace,’’ who said he believed there was 
‘‘no 
question’’ 
Donald 
Trump 
was 
‘‘morally responsible’’ for the attacks, 
now finds this whole endeavor unneces-
sary. 
Of course, that wasn’t always the 
case. In the aftermath of the Capitol 
attack, the Republican leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, said we needed a ‘‘serious 
and thorough review’’ of the attacks, 
but very quickly the goalposts started 
to move. A few weeks after the attack, 
Republicans started complaining that 
the Democratic proposals for estab-
lishing a Commission were too par-
tisan. When Democrats accepted all the 
changes—all the changes—requested by 
House Republicans, the Senate Repub-
lican leader said that his conference 
was undecided but ‘‘willing to listen.’’ 
But now, once again, the goalposts 
have shifted. Now the Republican lead-
er believes we don’t need a bipartisan 
Commission at all. 
Let me be very clear to my Repub-
lican colleagues: There is no good jus-
tification for opposing the Commis-
sion. The Commission is not partisan. 
It will have a 50–50 split of Democrats 
and Republicans with subpoena powers 
requiring cooperation from both sides. 
It was negotiated on a bipartisan basis 
by both the chairman and the ranking 
member of the House Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. It won the support of 
35 Republicans on the House floor. 
The Commission is not duplicative. 
The scope of the investigations into 
January 6 by our Senate committees is 
very focused. We need a dedicated bi-
partisan Commission to look at the 
whole picture. The fact that our com-
mittees can investigate didn’t stop 
Congress from establishing a 9/11 Com-
mission. A January 6 Commission is 
necessary for the same reasons that 
the 9/11 Commission was necessary. 
The real reason it seems Republican 
leaders are suddenly opposed to this bi-
partisan Commission is they don’t 
want to talk about the Big Lie at all. 
They don’t even want to investigate 
how former President Trump insti-
gated an attack on our democracy be-
cause he was angry about losing the 
2020 election and lied to the American 
people about the results. 
Even now, 5 months to the day after 
he left office, the Republican Party is 
still so terrified of Donald Trump that 
they are apparently willing to abandon 
the truth and the safety of our democ-
racy on into the future. 
Maybe, despite the opposition of the 
Republican 
leader—the 
unfortunate 
and sad opposition of the Republican 
leader—enough of my Republican col-
leagues will step up and join with 
Democrats to establish the Commis-
sion. They will get a chance to do so 
very soon. 
f 
U.S. INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. On another matter, 
the Senate continues to make great 
progress on the modified Endless Fron-
tier Act, now called the U.S. Innova-
tion and Competition Act. Yesterday, 
we considered two amendments and 
added one of them to the bill, a bipar-
tisan 
amendment 
led 
by 
Senators 
HIRONO and TILLIS. Today, we will con-
sider another two amendments. 
As my colleagues know, the bill itself 
is the product of at least six Senate 
committees and already includes input 
of nearly every Member of the Senate. 
And, as promised, we are working in a 
bipartisan way, in a much more open 
way than the Senate used to act, to 
allow amendments and have debate. 
This is an issue where our two parties 
are working together with a great deal 
of cooperation. Down to a Member, I 
believe we all want to see the United 
States maintain its position as the 
global economic leader in the 21st cen-
tury. We all want to see America stay 
No. 1 in science and technology. It is so 
important for jobs, for our economic 
security, for our national security. 
We have an extraordinary oppor-
tunity to set our country on a path to 
outinnovate, 
outproduce, 
and 
outcompete the world in the industries 
of the future. Let’s keep working and 
deliver a strong bipartisan result by 
the end of next week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
we know that competition with China 
will shape America’s security and pros-
perity for decades to come. That is a 
fact. The legislation on the floor pur-
ports to deal with this issue. It covers 
a huge range of topics, from economics 
to education, to foreign and defense 
policy. Earlier this week, I voted with 
the majority of Senators to proceed to 
this important debate, but as Members 
have noted, this bill did not come out 
of committee quite ready for prime 
time. It needs thorough floor consider-
ation, with a robust, bipartisan amend-
ment process. 
Today, we will vote on a very impor-
tant amendment that I will be proud to 
support. Ranking Member INHOFE and 
Vice Chairman SHELBY have legislation 
that will return the pivotal issue of the 
funding of our national defense to the 
center of the conversation about com-
peting with China, and this is right 
where it belongs. 
All the soft power in the world will 
only benefit us as long as we have the 
hard power to back it up. We must 
maintain our military edge against 
China and Russia. Yet, for all of this 
talk about competing with China, the 
Biden administration’s budget proposal 
seeks to cut defense spending after in-
flation. 
China’s long-term military invest-
ments are paying dividends that really 
should alarm us, but Democrats want 
to pump the brakes on our own? Fewer 
resources for our own men and women 
in uniform? Less defense innovation? 
What sense does that make? 
If there is truly broad bipartisan sup-
port for taking our competition with 
China more seriously, there ought to 
be big bipartisan support for the 
Inhofe-Shelby amendment later today. 
(Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the 
Chair.) 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
another matter, our Nation’s southern 
border is still in crisis. The Biden ad-
ministration still won’t admit it. Much 
of the media would prefer not to cover 
it, but the facts are clear, and they are 
unacceptable. 
A few days ago, Customs and Border 
Protection issued its report on the 
month of April. The number of encoun-
ters with illegal entrants was 3 percent

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3175 
May 20, 2021 
higher in April than it was in March. 
The crisis is still growing. Encounters 
with single adults on the border were 
613 percent higher last month versus 
April of last year, when the Trump ad-
ministration put emergency measures 
in place. Encounters with unaccom-
panied children were up 2,217 percent 
year over year. Let me say that one 
more time: 2,217 percent more kids, 
without parents, at our border on 
President Biden’s watch. 
The administration has tried to boast 
that the number of unaccompanied 
kids in the custody of the Department 
of Homeland Security has gone down. 
It has. It is because they have trans-
ferred large numbers of kids from DHS 
to HHS. There are now more than 19,000 
children in the custody of Health and 
Human Services, and hundreds more 
are arriving every single day. 
We know why all of this is hap-
pening. When Washington Democrats 
spent years reciting the mantra ‘‘Abol-
ish ICE; abolish ICE,’’ people listened. 
When our new President spent his cam-
paign signaling he would support a 
weaker border when he expressed that 
he supported providing government 
healthcare to people here illegally, 
people actually took note. Now the 
Democrats cannot get control of the 
crisis that they have stoked. 
The Vice President—supposedly, the 
point person to fix illegal immigra-
tion—has yet to even visit the south-
ern border. 
Apparently, Secretary Becerra’s op-
eration at HHS has, in some instances, 
left migrant children stranded on buses 
for multiple days—exactly the kind of 
unacceptable 
mismanagement 
that 
Senate Republicans feared we might 
see under an HHS Secretary without 
relevant healthcare or management ex-
perience. Last week, HHS announced it 
would be taking money that was meant 
to replenish the Strategic National 
Stockpile—money to fight this pan-
demic and future pandemics—to help 
with the migrant crisis. 
Well, today, the Senate will consider 
another amendment from the senior 
Senator from Wisconsin. It would stop 
the Biden administration from can-
celing contracts that are already in 
place to build a wall on our southern 
border. Perhaps our Democratic col-
leagues will help us begin to address 
the border crisis this administration 
has caused. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
as Democrats have pushed their mas-
sive political takeover bill, S. 1, Ameri-
cans’ First Amendment rights and pri-
vacy rights have been thrust into cen-
ter stage. The legislation contains mul-
tiple elements that would chill Ameri-
cans’ exercise of free speech and let 
Washington bureaucrats hoard more of 
citizens’ private information without 
cause. We know exactly how this could 
go wrong. 
Remember President Obama’s IRS 
scandal? Unelected bureaucrats treated 
organizations differently and subjected 
Americans to unequal scrutiny depend-
ing on their beliefs. Nonprofits with a 
whiff—just a whiff—of conservative be-
liefs were slow-walked and singled out 
for unfair treatment. Or think back to 
2014. The Obama administration had to 
reach a settlement after a government 
worker leaked confidential information 
about a conservative group, which was 
in 
violation 
of 
Federal 
law. 
Unsurprisingly, those private details 
found their way to a liberal group that 
had plenty of ideas about what to do 
with them. 
Courts have found that the State of 
California has repeatedly leaked or in-
appropriately released confidential in-
formation about nonprofits’ donors. 
Last year, in remembering all of these 
incidents, the Treasury Department fi-
nalized action on a basic, commonsense 
principle: If there is no legitimate rea-
son for the IRS to have certain infor-
mation, then the IRS shouldn’t collect 
it. 
It makes sense. 
The prior administration had the IRS 
stop the blanket collection of non-
public information about citizens who 
make non-—I repeat, non-—tax-deduct-
ible contributions to certain organiza-
tions. Contributions to 501(c)(4) organi-
zations are not tax deductible. The IRS 
doesn’t need these details just for 
kicks and giggles, but now the Demo-
crats’ political takeover bills would 
roll back this step and open new fronts 
in the far-left war on privacy and free 
speech. 
S. 1 would narrow the protections of 
the First Amendment. It would em-
power the Feds with new authority to 
track and police the speech of Ameri-
cans. This is the same bill that would 
essentially make Washington Demo-
crats the board of elections for every 
county and State in America. I guess, 
somehow, maybe, that wasn’t enough. 
Well, I have worked with my col-
league from Indiana, Senator BRAUN, 
on legislation to nip one part of this 
nonsense right in the bud. Our bill 
would codify the rule issued by the last 
administration. Americans would re-
main free from a Federal dragnet col-
lecting private information that it nei-
ther needs nor uses for legitimate law 
enforcement 
purposes—information 
that can be mishandled or, worse, used 
to target and harass Americans based 
on their views. 
So I am proud to stand with Senator 
BRAUN, with 39 Republican cosponsors, 
and with citizens across America, 
across the political spectrum, who 
don’t need the IRS peering into their 
First Amendment activities any more 
than is strictly necessary. I would cer-
tainly urge all of our colleagues to sup-
port our simple bill. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO KEVIN GROUT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
one final matter, my Senate office is 
losing a talented and dedicated young 
staffer this week. Fortunately, he has 
just been on loan from his home 
State—our home State—all along, and 
he is now heading back to the Blue-
grass. 
Kevin Grout started with me 5 years 
ago. This bright, sharp, and cheerful, 
young McConnell Scholar from the 
University of Louisville began as a 
staff assistant in the mailroom or, you 
might say, as sort of my ‘‘body man.’’ 
But in this line of work, talent attracts 
responsibility. Before long, Kevin had 
graduated to serve as the speechwriter 
in my personal office. In 41⁄2 years, he 
has helped me craft more remarks, op- 
eds, and written statements than any 
of us could possibly count—almost all 
focused on issues that matter most to 
Kentuckians. 
We are sorry to lose Kevin’s talents 
here on the team, but Kevin and his 
wife Addie are taking their careers and 
their young son Henry and putting 
down roots where it all began. Wash-
ington will be sorry to see them go, but 
it will be Kentucky’s good fortune to 
welcome him back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3176 
May 20, 2021 
SEC. ll. POINT OF ORDER TO ENSURE UNITED 
STATES ADEQUATELY FUNDS NA-
TIONAL DEFENSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Relative to the February 2021 Congres-
sional 
Budget 
Office 
spending 
baseline, 
President Joseph R. Biden has proposed more 
than $6,000,000,000,000 in nondefense spending 
outside the annual appropriations process. 
(2) President Biden’s fiscal year 2022 budget 
request proposes to increase spending in the 
nondefense discretionary category by almost 
20 percent while cutting the United States 
defense budget in real terms. 
(3) 
This 
Act 
contains 
more 
than 
$100,000,000,000 of authorizations of appro-
priations without a single additional dollar 
authorized to be appropriated for the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
(4) The United States Armed Forces has 
lost $400,000,000,000 relative to inflation since 
2011. 
(5) The People’s Liberation Army has expe-
rienced real budget growth for more than 
two decades, including 6.8 percent growth in 
2021. 
(6) A July 22, 2019, statement by Speaker of 
the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi 
and Senator Chuck Schumer stated that 
‘‘Democrats have always insisted on parity 
in increases between defense and non-de-
fense’’. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that Congress should ade-
quately fund national defense with a whole- 
of-government investment plan for strategic 
competition with the People’s Republic of 
China, including by adhering to the principle 
of parity between increases for defense and 
nondefense spending, which would result in 
significant real growth for the defense budg-
et. 
(c) POINT OF ORDER FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022.— 
It shall not be in order in the Senate to con-
sider— 
(1) a concurrent resolution on the budget, 
or an amendment to, conference report on, 
amendment between the Houses in relation 
to, or a motion on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget, that determines and declares as 
the appropriate level of new discretionary 
budget authority for major functional cat-
egory 050 (National Defense) for fiscal year 
2022 an amount that is less than the total 
amount of the appropriate level of new dis-
cretionary budget authority determined and 
declared for all major functional categories 
other than major functional category 050 for 
fiscal year 2022; 
(2) a bill or joint resolution reported pursu-
ant to section 310 of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 641), or an amendment 
to, conference report on, amendment be-
tween the Houses in relation to, or motion 
on such a bill or joint resolution, that appro-
priates amounts for 1 or more major func-
tional categories other than major func-
tional category 050 for fiscal year 2022 and 
does not appropriate amounts for major 
functional category 050 for fiscal year 2022 in 
an amount that is not less than the amount 
appropriated under that measure for all 
major 
functional 
categories 
other 
than 
major functional category 050 for fiscal year 
2022; or 
(3) a bill or joint resolution making appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022, or an amend-
ment to, conference report on, amendment 
between the Houses in relation to, or motion 
on such a bill or joint resolution, that would 
cause the total amount of appropriations for 
the revised nonsecurity category for fiscal 
year 2022 to exceed the total amount of ap-
propriations for the revised security cat-
egory for fiscal year 2022. 
(d) WAIVER
AND APPEAL.—Subsection (c) 
may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-
firmative vote of three-fifths of the Members 
of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall 
be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
of the Chair on a point of order raised under 
subsection (a). 
(e) DEFINITIONS.—In this section, the terms 
‘‘revised nonsecurity category’’ and ‘‘revised 
security category’’ have the meanings given 
those terms in section 250(c)(4) of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900(c)(4)). 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. JOHNSON] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1518. 
The amendment is as follows: 
AMENDMENT NO. 1518 
(Purpose: To prohibit the cancellation of 
contracts for physical barriers and other 
border security measures for which funds 
already have been obligated and for which 
penalties will be incurred in the case of 
such cancellation and prohibiting the use 
of funds for payment of such penalties) 
At the appropriate place in division D, in-
sert the following: 
SEC. 4ll. PROHIBITING THE CANCELLATION OF 
CERTAIN CONTRACTS FOR PHYS-
ICAL BARRIERS AND OTHER BOR-
DER SECURITY MEASURES. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, the Secretary of Homeland Security and 
any other Federal official may not— 
(1) cancel, invalidate, or breach any con-
tract for the construction or improvement of 
any physical barrier along the United States 
border or for any other border security meas-
ures for which Federal funds have been obli-
gated; or 
(2) obligate the use of Federal funds to pay 
any penalty resulting from the cancellation 
of any contract described in paragraph (1). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
PIPELINES AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the re-
cent Colonial Pipeline hack, which saw 
more than 15,000 gas stations run out of 
fuel and drove gas prices to their high-
est level in almost 7 years, was a time-
ly reminder of the importance of cyber 
security. 
In today’s world, where almost every-
thing we do has a cyber component, 
cyber security has to be a priority. 
Companies have to prioritize it to keep 
their systems, services, and customer 
information secure. State governments 
have to prioritize it, and the Federal 
Government has to prioritize it. Cyber 
security is a crucial part of our na-
tional defense, and it is vital that we 
keep security systems and data secure. 
The Colonial Pipeline hack was also 
a timely reminder of something else, 
and that is the importance of main-
taining our energy security via energy 
independence. 
As Americans panicked over gas 
shortages from the Colonial shutdown, 
gas stations saw lines that harkened 
back to the 1970s, when conflict in the 
Middle East and an oil embargo re-
sulted in serious shortages here at 
home. 
Since then, the United States has, to 
a greater or lesser extent, worked to 
become energy independent; in other 
words, to make sure that we are able to 
rely almost entirely on North Amer-
ican energy sources instead of imports 
from overseas and to make sure that 
American consumers never have to 
question whether they will have reli-
able and affordable access to energy 
and fuel. 
We have made a lot of progress on 
that front, but it requires continued 
commitment and investment. It also 
requires an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
policy that pursues investment in ev-
erything from oil and natural gas, to 
ethanol and other biofuels, to solar, 
wind, and hydropower. Unfortunately, 
Democrats are increasingly minimizing 
the oil and natural gas part of that 
equation. 
I am a longtime advocate of clean en-
ergy and clean fuels, but the fact is 
that our economy is still going to need 
traditional sources of energy—namely, 
oil and natural gas—for a long time to 
come. I don’t expect airplanes or 
freight trains to be running on elec-
tricity or solar power anytime in the 
near future. Fortunately, as tech-
nology has advanced, it has become 
easier and easier to explore for, ex-
tract, and transport oil and natural gas 
in an environmentally responsible way. 
It is vital that we continue to de-
velop domestic oil and gas resources so 
that, down the road, we don’t find our-
selves again relying on oil from the 
Middle East, Venezuela, or other unsta-
ble areas of the world. That is why it 
was so disappointing that one of Presi-
dent Biden’s first actions as President 
was to pause new leases for oil and gas 
production on Federal lands and off-
shore. 
Oil and gas production on public 
lands and offshore is an essential part 
of the U.S. domestic energy supply, ac-
counting for 22 percent of domestic oil 
production and 12 percent of domestic 
gas production in 2019. Only a tiny per-
centage of public land is used for pro-
duction, but the resulting oil and nat-
ural gas is significant. 
Halting new oil and gas drilling could 
jeopardize the stability of our afford-
able energy supply, and it would defi-
nitely jeopardize the hundreds of thou-
sands of American jobs that are sup-
ported by this industry, not to mention 
the billions of dollars of revenue that 
oil and gas development disburses to 
States and to Federal programs like 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
Another early and discouraging sign 
of President Biden’s hostility to afford-
able and reliable energy security came 
when he halted construction of the 
Keystone XL Pipeline on the first day 
of his Presidency. That one hit particu-
larly close to home since the pipeline 
would have run through nine counties 
in South Dakota and brought economic 
growth to small towns like Philip and 
Murdo. 
The Keystone XL Pipeline has to be 
the most studied project, literally, in 
the history of our Nation, probably in 
the history of the world, and it has 
been pretty conclusively demonstrated 
that the pipeline would provide an en-
vironmentally 
responsible 
way

transporting oil from Canada and the 
Bakken oilfields in Montana and North 
Dakota to refineries on the gulf coast. 
The Obama administration—that is 
right, the Obama administration—con-
cluded that the pipeline provided the 
most environmentally sensitive way of 
transporting the oil. Canadian Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau, a staunch lib-
eral, included the pipeline in Canada’s 
clean energy plan. On top of all that, 
the pipeline’s owner committed to off-
setting the pipeline’s operations with 
$1.7 billion in renewable energy invest-
ment. 
But none of that mattered to leftist 
environmentalists, who fixed on Key-
stone XL as a proxy for their opposi-
tion to oil. It is difficult to think of a 
more 
counterproductive 
crusade. 
Thanks to their efforts, oil that would 
have been transported via the pipeline 
will now be transported by rail or 
truck—more 
environmentally 
haz-
ardous methods of travel, which, inci-
dentally, will also produce far more 
emissions—emissions that will likely 
not be offset by a renewable energy in-
vestment. 
I haven’t even mentioned the cost to 
people’s livelihoods. The cancelation of 
the pipeline will end up costing 11,000 
American jobs, most of them those 
good union jobs the President keeps 
talking about. It also means that 
Americans will not see lower prices at 
the pump as a result of the efficiencies 
of the pipeline, which is particularly 
frustrating at a time when prices are 
rising. But when you are pursuing an 
ideological crusade, I guess all that 
doesn’t matter. 
I find it particularly fascinating—or 
maybe more accurately, troubling— 
that the President canceled the Key-
stone XL Pipeline and its 11,000 Amer-
ican jobs yet is conceding to Russia— 
Russia—on the construction of a Rus-
sian 
pipeline, 
Nord 
Stream 
2, 
by 
waiving sanctions against the Russian 
company constructing the pipeline. 
Think about that. The irony. Of course, 
the President has more direct author-
ity over pipelines here in the United 
States, but the President is taking a 
notably new position. 
The successful construction of Nord 
Stream 2 will further isolate Ukraine 
and deny the country billions in rev-
enue as it defends against Russian ag-
gression, and it will make our allies 
more dependent on Russia’s energy mo-
nopoly for their energy supplies. 
The President has talked aggres-
sively about countering Putin and Rus-
sian aggression, and his Secretary of 
State has talked explicitly about the 
importance of halting the construction 
of Nord Stream 2. But now, with a 
chance to do something about halting 
the construction of the pipeline, the 
President is taking the pressure off, 
even though the President himself has 
correctly called the pipeline ‘‘a fun-
damentally bad deal’’ for Europe. 
It is deeply troubling that our Euro-
pean allies may soon be relying on Rus-
sia for an increased portion of their en-
ergy needs. Yet it is another reminder 
of the need to make sure that the 
United States is not dependent on bad 
actors anywhere in the world for our 
oil or any other energy resource. 
I hope the Biden administration will 
end its embargo on new oil and gas 
leases and think about pursuing an en-
ergy policy that embraces not only en-
vironmentalists’ pet energy projects 
but all—all—important energy sources. 
It is no exaggeration to say that our 
very national security depends on it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
think I am like you in one respect. You 
know, I don’t hate anybody, and I try 
to look for grace everywhere I can find 
it. I have always believed there is al-
ways something to be thankful for. 
I came today to thank the Biden ad-
ministration but also to ask for its 
help. 
First, I want to thank the President 
for encouraging everybody to take the 
vaccine. I don’t think anybody should 
be required to take the vaccine, and I 
am not saying President Biden does, 
but he and his team have been very ag-
gressive in encouraging Americans to 
take the vaccine, and I think that is 
the proper approach. 
Do you have polio, Mr. President? I 
know you don’t. I don’t either. Thank 
you, science. The vaccine, I think, 
works. And once again, we are not tell-
ing anybody they have to take it, but I 
wish people would stop and reflect on it 
and weigh the pros and the cons, and I 
think they will see the pros outweigh 
the cons. I want to thank President 
Biden for his efforts in that regard. 
Here 
is 
my 
criticism: 
President 
Biden, at the worst possible time, is 
about to raise the insurance premiums 
for every flood insurance policyholder 
in America or almost all of them. So 
much for not hurting the middle class. 
So much for not taxing the working 
people. 
As you know, the National Flood In-
surance Program, which is adminis-
tered by FEMA, began in 1968. Many 
people don’t know this, but if we own a 
home and we have homeowners insur-
ance, 
our 
homeowners 
insurance 
doesn’t cover flooding. If we do want 
flood coverage and we call our agent 
and ask them to place our flood cov-
erage with a private company, they are 
very difficult to find. 
Almost no private companies offer 
flood insurance. So in 1968, the U.S. 
Congress decided to form the National 
Flood Insurance Program and have 
FEMA 
administer 
it. 
We 
insure, 
through our National Flood Insurance 
Program—which, once again, is the al-
most exclusive source of flood insur-
ance for the American people—we in-
sure about 5 million people. About 
500,000 of those people are in my State, 
Louisiana, but we are not alone. I am 
sure we have people in Colorado. I 
know we have people in New Jersey 
and New York, in most of the coastal 
States and in many of the inland 
States, who have flood insurance. 
Now, FEMA has decided to imple-
ment a new program called Risk Rat-
ing 2.0. They always come up with a 
fancy name when they are going to 
screw you. Risk Rating 2.0. If you ask 
FEMA about it—you say: Well, what 
does this do, FEMA? Well, they try not 
to answer your question first, and they 
dodge and they bob and weave, but if 
you pin them down and read their lit-
erature, they will say: Well, with Risk 
Rating 2.0, we no longer are going to 
assess premiums on the basis of area; 
we are going to look at every specific 
home and assess its risk and assign a 
premium. We are also going to consider 
the future of climate change, what 
things are going to be like 15, 20, 30 
years from now. 
I didn’t come to debate climate 
change. I will save that for another 
day. There is a lot not to debate about. 
There is a lot we agree about. But this 
is coming from so-called experts. They 
are going to be able to predict things 
30, 40, 50, 100 years from now, when 
they can’t tell us if it is going to rain 
on Friday. 
This is all a very clever way to raise 
everybody’s premiums. As best I can 
tell, about 80 percent of the people in 
my State who have to have flood insur-
ance are going to see their rates go up. 
FEMA is probably going to start by 
doing a little bit the first year. They 
are going to say: See, we told you that 
wasn’t going to hurt. But then they are 
going to do it the second year and third 
year and fourth year and fifth year and 
sixth year. 
Some of FEMA’s minions who are ad-
vocating this say: Well, Kennedy, it is 
not right for the American people to be 
subsidizing wealthy people who have 
two or three homes and one of which is 
on the beach. 
I agree with that. Those are not my 
people. Those are not my people. My 
people who have flood insurance get up 
every day, go to work, obey the law, 
pay their taxes, try to do the right 
thing by their kids, try to save a little 
money for retirement, and their big-
gest financial asset is their home. 
Through Risk Rating 2.0 or whatever 
clever name they call it, when they 
start raising premiums, a lot of my 
people can’t afford it, and it is going to 
impact the value of their home. They 
are going to lose equity in their most 
valuable asset, and they are not going 
to be able to sell it. And you don’t have 
to be Einstein’s cousin to figure this 
out. FEMA knows what it is doing. 
This is the most dramatic trans-
formation and change to the National 
Flood Insurance Program since 1968. 
You would think that Congress would 
have something to do with it. Wrong. 
FEMA is doing this on their own. The 
first increases for new policyholders 
are going to take effect in October; for 
everybody else, in April 2022. 
You go to FEMA and say: Can we 
talk about this?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3178 
May 20, 2021 
No. Read our pamphlet. 
They haven’t had any public hear-
ings. They haven’t allowed the public 
to comment. They hired a very expen-
sive consultant. They love expensive 
consultants at FEMA—the more expen-
sive, the better; the more expensive the 
lawyers are, the better. They have 
hired a consultant to try to cover their 
tracks on what they are doing here. 
This is just a flat-out rate increase. 
Insurance companies help FEMA ad-
minister the program. FEMA has told, 
we found out, the insurance companies: 
We can’t tell you about the new pro-
gram unless you sign a nondisclosure 
agreement because we don’t want you 
to tell anybody. 
I mean, President Biden’s FEMA is 
just going to drop this on us. And it is 
not just Louisiana. Look, this does in-
volve Louisiana. I mean, last year, my 
people, we got hit by two major 
storms. We got hit, like a lot of States, 
by an ice storm. Right now, South Lou-
isiana, or a big portion of it, is under-
water. We just got hit with between 8 
and 20 inches of rain, and we have peo-
ple who are flooding who are not even 
near a body of water. 
I promise you, if you get 8 to 20 
inches of rain in a short period of time, 
you are going to flood—I don’t care if 
you are in the desert. I don’t care if 
you are on Pikes Peak—you are going 
to flood. The water has to go some-
where. 
So, yes, this impacts Louisiana, but 
do you know who else it impacts? New 
York. New Jersey. They are going to 
get devastated. 
Chairman BROWN, the chairman of 
our Banking Committee, very gener-
ously held a hearing the other day on 
Risk Rating 2.0. We had some really 
smart people come and testify about it. 
Of course FEMA wasn’t there. You 
can’t find FEMA with a search party. 
You can’t find FEMA with Google. 
They are nowhere to be found. They 
don’t want to answer questions. 
But we had a very intelligent, im-
pressive lady from New York—I am 
sorry, I have forgotten her name—who 
testified very eloquently about how 
this rating increase across the board, 
willy-nilly, arbitrary, capricious—we 
don’t have any input—is going to dev-
astate New York. 
I am just very disappointed, and I am 
asking President Biden today to pick 
up the telephone and call his new 
FEMA Director and say: Slow down. At 
a minimum, don’t treat the American 
people like morons. Sit down and talk 
to them and explain what you are pro-
posing to do and why you are doing it, 
and let them have input. 
The second thing I wish the Presi-
dent would do is pick up the phone and 
call his FEMA Director and say: Would 
you please consult Congress and talk 
to Congress about it and let Congress 
have a little input? Because last time I 
checked, there are three branches of 
government, and this is unilateral ac-
tion by one Federal Agency. 
This is serious stuff. This is going to 
impact a lot of people. I said this be-
fore, and I don’t mean to overuse it. I 
try to save it for really serious situa-
tions. But this is as serious as four 
heart attacks and a stroke, and it is 
going to happen out of the blue come 
October. 
I would just like to ask President 
Biden to consider asking his FEMA Di-
rector to please slow down and let us 
think this through. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1523 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am op-
posing this amendment before us. I just 
thought I would mention some of the 
pragmatic reasons for that. A mandate 
to offer dollar-for-dollar parity be-
tween defense and nondefense programs 
unless there are 60 votes to overcome 
the point of order is not limited to dis-
cretionary spending, which would be in 
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills, 
but in all Federal spending. 
Let me tell you what that means. It 
may make people feel good, but let me 
tell you what it does. If you provide a 
dollar to the Defense Department for 
every dollar of nondefense spending, 
well, it is simply arbitrary. 
These are some of the absurd results. 
Under this amendment, if we pass an 
infrastructure bill through reconcili-
ation—and we know that in the States 
represented by all 100 of us, we have 
roads, bridges, water systems, every-
thing else breaking down and deterio-
rating and has to be fixed. If we don’t 
do it now, it is going to cost us a heck 
of a lot more in the future. 
So let’s say we have $2 trillion to re-
build our bridges, our roads, our water 
systems, broadband, and so on, but 
then we would have to automatically 
provide $2 trillion more for defense, 
nearly tripling the defense budget and 
spending more on defense than the rest 
of the world put together. And the De-
partment of Defense says very frankly 
that there is no way they could spend 
that kind of money—unless we have 60 
votes, a supermajority. Now, come on. 
I will give another example. This can 
get really weird. Suppose a hurricane 
hits somewhere in the South. We have 
seen that happen—hurricanes, torna-
does, flooding—or you have massive 
fires that rage out in the West. 
So as we have always come together 
in the past, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, to help those communities 
that have been destroyed—we are the 
United States of America—then let’s 
say we provide $10 billion, which we 
have in the past, to help communities 
recover and rebuild. Well, then, even 
though they don’t want it, we have to 
provide $10 billion to the Department 
of Defense. 
And why are we spending that? Be-
cause they had a flood in Louisiana or 
a tornado in the Midwest or an earth-
quake in the West or a forest fire. Well, 
we have got to rebuild them, but we 
have got to spend an equal amount at 
the Department of Defense, whether 
they want it or not. 
In another way, let’s say we increase 
funding for veterans, which we should. 
Well, then, we would have to say: Well, 
wait a minute. The Department of De-
fense will have to have a dollar-for-dol-
lar increase. I can go on and on with a 
whole lot of other examples. 
We are going to have to obviously ad-
dress the costs and the efforts that we 
went through here because of the riots 
on January 6. Do we do an equal 
amount for the Department of Defense 
if we repair the damage done to the 
Capitol? 
Now, why don’t I suggest that we do 
what we were taught to do, and I have 
seen the Senate do over the past 40- 
some-odd years, we actually have de-
bate about appropriations? Have a de-
bate about the defense level. Either 
vote up or down. Have a debate about 
nondefense spending in fiscal year 2022 
and vote it up or down. Let’s not start 
off with some arbitrary rules, which 
make no sense—an arbitrary rule that 
says we are probably going to have to 
hesitate to help out the communities 
that have been struck by a tornado be-
cause we have to spend twice as much 
money as it would cost to repair those 
communities because we have to put an 
equal amount into the defense budget, 
whether they want it or not. 
Now, I can say this, as chairman of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
I understand some annual increases in 
the Defense bill, but that should be 
considered as the Defense bill, just as 
we should consider our healthcare bills, 
just as we should consider infrastruc-
ture bills, education, and all those. We 
can easily do each part of these appro-
priations bills that make some sense to 
the American people. 
In the past, many times we have been 
able to get bipartisan agreement. Let’s 
do that. Let’s stop playing like chil-
dren or some arbitrary ‘‘You give me 
this; I will give you that’’ kind of rule. 
We are U.S. Senators. We should be 
above that. We should be the con-
science of the Nation. There are only 
100 of us. The country looks at us. We 
ought to respond to the country. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
I note that no one is seeking recogni-
tion at the moment. I just had another 
thing. The House of Representatives 
did the right thing. They passed a bi-
partisan vote to have an independent 
Commission to find out what happened 
on January 6—what sparked it; who 
was involved; how many crimes were 
committed; why did police officers who 
protect the Capitol lose their lives; 
why did others lose their lives; why did 
we have such a huge amount of dam-
age; why did we end up spending hun-
dreds of millions of dollars; why were 
the lives of Republican and Democratic

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3179 
May 20, 2021 
Members of Congress put at risk? Why 
not have, as we did after 9/11 and other 
major things in our country, a bipar-
tisan committee to look at it? 
That is what the House voted on last 
night. I am disturbed when I hear Re-
publican leaders, both in the House and 
the Senate, say: We don’t want to have 
any kind of a hearing. We don’t want 
to know what happened. We don’t want 
anybody to ask a question. 
Well, I don’t know about your State, 
but I can imagine you probably heard a 
lot of questions from the people in your 
State. I heard a lot of questions from 
Republicans and Democrats alike in 
my State who basically said: What in 
heaven’s name has happened? We are 
the greatest country on Earth, and we 
are seeing our symbol of democracy 
with a mob of people going in. People 
are dying. Property is being smashed. 
People are posing for selfies: Hey, I am 
breaking the law; don’t I look great? 
There was a gallows with a noose and 
with the name of the Vice President of 
the United States on it put outside 
here. 
Come on. We ought to find out what 
happened. We were shamed throughout 
the world by what happened. Let’s not 
have that happen again. Let’s have a 
real committee. Find out what hap-
pened and who was responsible and see 
what steps we take not to have that 
happen again. 
I am proud of the U.S. Capitol. I have 
had the opportunity to serve here for 
decades. I remember coming through 
this body as a teenager with my par-
ents and being awed by it. I looked at 
the Brumidi paintings with my Italian- 
American mother and the pride she felt 
looking at that. I looked at other 
things with my Irish-American father 
and the pride he had in the history. All 
of us did. I have taken Vermonters 
from both parties through here, en-
joyed pointing it out, and everybody 
feeling the sense of history. 
So what do we see now? A locked- 
down Capitol because of the insurrec-
tion. And we don’t want to actually 
ask questions? What is this? What is 
this? Why don’t we all just cower under 
our desks? 
Well, we can’t ask a question. I am 
going to hide down here. I see nothing. 
Oh, come on now. The American people 
saw plenty. Let’s have that committee. 
Let’s have that Commission. Let’s find 
out what happened and make sure, for 
God’s sake, it never happens again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
S. 1260 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, global 
hegemony is a Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s ultimate aim—we all know that— 
and they have grown increasingly bra-
zen in their power plays designed to 
seize that. 
The bill before the Senate purports 
to counter Chinese ambition and ag-
gression by accelerating, among other 
things, American investment in crit-
ical technologies, but I believe such in-
vestment will fail to meet the objec-
tive if we shortchange America’s mili-
tary. Unfortunately, that is just what 
President Biden plans to do. 
Yes, amid all the tough talk about 
China, President Biden proposes in-
creasing domestic spending by nearly 
20 percent while holding defense spend-
ing basically flat. And that is on top of 
several trillion more he has proposed in 
off-budget spending to supercharge the 
far-left agenda here at home. 
Meanwhile, China is headed in the 
opposite 
direction, 
increasing 
the 
budget for the People’s Liberation 
Army by nearly 7 percent this year. 
Don’t think for a moment they aren’t 
taking note of President Biden’s plans 
and sensing weakness and opportunity 
here because they are. The Chinese 
Communist Party and the Chinese 
leadership, which is the same, under-
stands and heeds only one thing: 
strength and power. 
A respected and feared American 
military, I believe, is the bulwark 
against the rise of China and the power 
of China. That is why we must not 
shortchange 
defense 
spending—not 
now, not ever. And that is why I am 
pleased to join my Republican col-
leagues in offering this amendment to 
ensure parity between increases in de-
fense and domestic spending. 
I encourage my colleagues on the 
other side to join us here in putting 
America’s security first. Projecting 
real strength to counter Chinese ambi-
tion and aggression should be a bipar-
tisan objective. We will see if it is. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, China is 
a 360-degree threat. They are com-
peting with us in every area—econom-
ics, technology, military, diplomacy, 
information warfare. You know, we op-
erated for the better part of a decade 
under the idea that we should have par-
ity in defense and nondefense in-
creases. I mean, this is a bipartisan 
thing. This is Democrats and Repub-
licans alike. We did this every year 
for—every 2 years as we did the Budget 
Control Act, and that was an agree-
ment until all of a sudden, somehow, 
we are changing from that. 
So what Senator SHELBY’s and my 
amendment does is very simple. It says 
that for every dollar that we increase 
nondefense spending, we have the same 
amount of money that is going to in-
crease defense spending. I talked about 
this yesterday at some length. 
How can you justify changing that 
policy when the greatest threat that 
we are facing right now is China? You 
know, they are competing in every 
area, and to leave that out conspicu-
ously is not reasonable at all. So I 
think that the—I remember that the 
majority leader and the Speaker of the 
House back in 2019 said: ‘‘Democrats 
have always insisted on parity in in-
creases between defense and non-de-
fense.’’ 
So why would they change now? And 
I don’t think that they will change 
now. So, again, I am unsure people un-
derstand what this is all about. This is 
a very simple thing. It says that—our 
amendment says that for every dollar 
we increase nondefense spending, we 
also increase defense spending by the 
same amount. It is called parity. We 
have lived with this right now for 8 
years. We have been in agreement, and 
somehow this has changed, as if the 
threat that we are facing right now 
with 
economics, 
technology, 
diplo-
macy, information warfare are more 
important than military. Military is 
the No. 1 threat. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I want 
to commend the distinguished Senator 
from Oklahoma and the distinguished 
senior Senator from Alabama for this 
amendment. And it seems to me that 
this is a national security amendment 
that should get support on both sides of 
the aisle because the Senator from 
Oklahoma is absolutely correct. It has 
had bipartisan support in the past. And 
particularly at this moment, when we 
are talking about a bill to compete 
with China, we need to acknowledge 
that we will compete with China both 
in the R&D sphere, as this bill dis-
cusses, but also in terms of military 
might. 
And it disturbs me, and I know it is 
of concern to my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, that the Biden admin-
istration just this week announced 
that they would cut four ships from the 
most recent shipbuilding plan, which 
was established by our military ex-
perts, by the admirals and generals 
who told us what we need. To cut four 
ships from the shipbuilding plan, I 
think, would send exactly the opposite 
signal to China that we are trying to 
send through this bill. And I know I 
have friends on the other side of the 
aisle, as well as on this side of the 
aisle, who have signed the SHIPYARD 
Act, which makes the statement, on a 
bipartisan basis, that we need to be 
preparing our Navy for competition in 
the Pacific that will come from China, 
and I think it is a way to preserve 
peace in the Asia-Pacific region by 
having parity there. 
So for that particular reason, on this 
particular week, this is a most timely 
and appropriate amendment, and I do 
hope we can get bipartisan support. 
I yield the floor.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1518 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, there 
was a time—and it really wasn’t all 
that long ago—when securing the bor-
der had bipartisan support. It was actu-
ally a bipartisan goal—now, I think 
that made a lot of sense—but it is not 
now. 
It also wasn’t all that long ago that, 
in 2006, Congress passed something 
called the Secure Fence Act of 2006. 
What that piece of legislation did was 
to authorize 700 miles of what was sup-
posed to be double-layered fencing. In 
the end, only 36 miles of actual double- 
layered fencing was constructed. An-
other 613 miles that consisted of about 
299 miles of vehicle fencing—in other 
words, people could just walk right 
through it—and another 314 miles of 
single-layered pedestrian barrier fenc-
ing were actually built. I think we 
have seen that unfortunately the fenc-
ing did not fulfill the requirements of 
the Secure Fence Act of 2006, and it 
also didn’t work. 
What is interesting to know about 
the passage of the Secure Fence Act is 
that it passed overwhelmingly in this 
Chamber by a vote of 80 to 19. There 
were 
26 
Democratic 
Senators 
who 
joined 54 Republicans in voting yes. It 
also passed the House by a pretty over-
whelming margin as well—283 to 138— 
with 64 Democrats joining the Repub-
licans. So the total count in Congress 
was 363 votes to build a fence and se-
cure the border versus 157 people who, 
apparently, didn’t have an interest. In 
other words, 70 percent of the Members 
of Congress who voted on the Secure 
Fence Act, who voted for border secu-
rity, voted yes. Again, that was with 
the support of 90 Democrats. 
By the way, some pretty notable 
Democrats voted to secure the border 
by building 700 miles of double-layered 
fence, including those who are current 
President 
Biden; 
former 
President 
Barack Obama; the current majority 
leader of the Senate, Senator SCHUMER; 
former Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton; my chairman and ranking member 
of Homeland Security, Senator TOM 
CARPER; the chairwoman of the Judici-
ary in the past, Senator FEINSTEIN; the 
current chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, Senator WYDEN. At the time, 
the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, was 
a Member of the House, and he voted 
for it in the House. Again, that was 
only 14, 15 years ago when securing the 
border was actually a bipartisan goal. 
What happened? Why isn’t that the 
case now? Why has securing the border 
become a partisan issue? 
Well, politics happened. 
I wasn’t here between 2006 and 2011, 
but I know there were multiple good- 
faith efforts to pass an immigration 
bill. They often referred to it as ‘‘com-
prehensive immigration reform.’’ I re-
member, when I got here, that this ef-
fort was still going on, and we actually 
passed, in this body, a comprehensive 
immigration bill. I remember talking 
to Senator McCain, who was one of the 
leading proponents. I did suggest that I 
would stop using the word ‘‘comprehen-
sive’’ and that I didn’t think we did a 
very good job with things comprehen-
sively here and that we ought to take 
a 
step-by-step 
approach. 
Senator 
McCain was not really happy with my 
comment, but I made it anyway. I still 
think, quite honestly, that the test of 
time has probably proven me right. 
Bipartisanship pretty well ended the 
efforts when that effort failed in the 
House. It didn’t move it any further. 
We had a split Chamber. So the Obama 
administration got impatient. I under-
stand the frustration. I certainly want 
to fix the problem. I want to take care 
of—now they are probably adults— 
those who came here as children 
through no fault of their own, the 
DACA kids. I think most Members of 
the Chamber want to do that, but you 
have to do it in a legal way, and you 
have to do it in a step-by-step ap-
proach, starting with securing our bor-
der. 
I will talk about that a little bit fur-
ther, but let me just talk about what 
the effect the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals had. 
It is pretty obvious, by this chart, 
that you can see this goes back to 2007. 
The red bar is just talking about unac-
companied children apprehended at the 
southwest border. You can see, through 
2011, that, at most, we had a little over 
4,000 unaccompanied children coming 
across the border illegally and being 
apprehended. 
Then, 
obviously, 
as 
Americans, we have to take care of 
them because we are compassionate. 
In June of 2012, the Obama adminis-
tration issued the DACA memorandum. 
The result was almost immediate. It 
was a magnet. It was a pull factor. It 
was used by the coyotes in Central 
America. They would tell people who 
would want to come to America—and 
let’s face it. Who wouldn’t want to be 
in America? I am highly sympathetic 
with the people who want to come to 
America and take advantage of this 
land of opportunities. The coyotes 
would tell the migrants down in Cen-
tral America: They changed their laws. 
Come with us. We will take you up to 
the border. We will get you across the 
border, and then you will get a slip, 
called a permiso, which is really a no-
tice to appear. 
So they came. They came in such 
quantities that, in 2014, more than 
51,000 unaccompanied children flooded 
our border, and President Obama right-
ly declared it a humanitarian crisis, 
and it was. That humanitarian crisis, 
at that point in time, entailed about 
2,000 people coming and being appre-
hended at the border—2,000. You can 
see the result. There were some ups 
and downs. 
Quite honestly, what ended up hap-
pening is the Obama administration 
started to detain families, for example. 
They put in a consequence, and it actu-
ally had an impact. I can show you this 
a little bit better on this chart that 
really just shows cause and effect. This 
chart picks up in 2012 with the passage 
of DACA. You can see that President 
Obama, in 2014, declared it a humani-
tarian crisis. That is, by the way, when 
they built that McAllen facility to 
which we went down as bipartisan 
Members of the Senate and sung CBC’s 
praises for trying to deal with this cri-
sis in such a humane fashion. Four and 
five years later, we have the same fa-
cility with the same conditions and a 
bigger crisis, but now that facility is

being referred to as keeping kids in 
cages. 
You can see what ended up happening 
here. President Obama actually had a 
family detention policy that kept the 
families together, but then a court re-
interpreted the Flores decision. It in-
terpreted 
unaccompanied 
children 
within the Flores decision, in terms of 
how you treated children and how you 
had to hand them over to HHS in a 
short period of time, and applied that 
to accompanied children. 
So now a tough decision had to be 
made: Do we actually separate the chil-
dren so they can be handed over to 
HHS while we detain the parents who 
came here illegally? 
The decision those in the Obama ad-
ministration made—and I really can’t 
blame them—was to keep the families 
together. What I blame them for is 
they dispersed them into America— 
most of them never to have an immi-
gration hearing. When you don’t have a 
hearing, you can’t have your asylum 
claim adjudicated properly. We know 
that a very high percentage of the asy-
lum seekers here do not qualify for 
asylum. Even as generous as our poli-
cies are, they still don’t qualify. Of the 
claims that are adjudicated, the people 
come here, and they stay. Then they 
communicate with other people in Cen-
tral America, and it feeds upon itself. 
It takes a while. It takes a few years. 
It took until 2018, 2019 that the word 
really got out. When Donald Trump 
was elected President, he was dedicated 
to securing the border, and we were 
going to fix this problem. You could 
tell immigration really dropped off fol-
lowing his election. People really felt 
that he was serious about it. By the 
way, he was, but he had no cooperation 
either by Congress or the courts of en-
forcing our laws and securing our bor-
ders. So word got out over a couple of 
years, and we had an explosion of ille-
gal immigration primarily fueled this 
time by families. 
President 
Trump—again, 
with 
no 
help from Congress and no help from 
the courts—fixed the problem. You 
may agree or disagree with the Mi-
grant Protection Protocols Program, 
otherwise known as ‘‘return to Mex-
ico,’’ but there was a consequence. Be-
cause of that consequence, combined 
with the fact that we also made agree-
ments with Mexico and Central Amer-
ica, people stopped coming. We had 
pretty well stopped the flow. We had 
reduced dramatically the flow of unac-
companied children and family mem-
bers coming to the border. We pretty 
well had had this problem solved before 
COVID hit. Throw on COVID and the 
invocation of title 42, and we really had 
this problem solved until the Presi-
dential debates, and you had all Demo-
cratic Presidential candidates say they 
were going to stop deportations and 
offer free healthcare. 
You can see the number of adults. By 
the way, we have a colored chart. Gold 
is single adults. Blue is family units. 
Red is children. 
So we had this enormous crisis, first 
of all, surging that began with single 
adults. Then, of course, on his first day 
in office, President Biden dismantled 
the Migrant Protection Program. He 
ended those agreements. He made good 
on his promise to end deportations 
until the court said he couldn’t do 
that, but the word was out. The crisis 
came back with a vengeance. In the 
last 2 months, there have been, on an 
average basis—daily—almost 6,000 peo-
ple per day being apprehended at the 
border. 
This crisis is out of control, but this 
crisis is also manmade. It is a man-
made crisis by President Biden’s poli-
cies. 
Last week we had a hearing with Sec-
retary Mayorkas, Secretary of the De-
partment of Homeland Security. It was 
actually surreal. First of all, they 
blamed this on President Trump, said 
this was an inherited crisis. No, it 
wasn’t. It is the Democratic Presi-
dential candidates who started the 
spike of single adults. It was President 
Biden’s 
dismantling 
of 
President 
Trump’s 
successful 
policies 
that 
sparked and was the catalyst for the 
renewed crisis of family units and un-
accompanied children coming here ille-
gally to exploit our very generous asy-
lum laws. 
So it was surreal to listen to the Sec-
retary and, quite honestly, the chair-
man of our committee talking about 
that this was an inherited crisis but 
that things were improving. But the 
only reason they could claim things 
were 
improving 
is—and 
Secretary 
Mayorkas said this repeatedly—they 
are getting more efficient. ‘‘We are get-
ting more efficient’’—not at solving 
the problem; at processing and dis-
persing the illegal immigrants coming 
into this country. Guess what that is 
going to do. It is just going to cause 
more to come. 
This crisis isn’t going to end anytime 
soon until we return to having con-
sequences and we actually have the 
goal of reducing or stopping the flow, 
and that is not happening right now. 
I was disappointed. Under my chair-
manship, we almost always had a sec-
ond round of questions, but we were de-
nied that. I am sure there were time 
constraints. But in a second round of 
questions, this is what I wanted to ask 
Secretary Mayorkas. I wanted to ask 
him whether he was aware that human 
traffickers sell children to adults so 
they can exploit our asylum laws by 
posing as a family unit. 
Understand, these policies that are 
being instituted to be more humane do 
the exact opposite. It leads to all kinds 
of human degradations, all kinds of in-
humanity. I knew it full well. We held 
hearings on this in 2018. Vice President 
Harris had to know as well; she was on 
my committee. 
I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas 
whether he was aware that we heard 
testimony during my chairmanship 
that a child was sold for $84. 
I wanted to ask him whether he is 
aware that children are recycled, that 
they are sent back over the border to 
be used by another adult to pose as a 
family unit and exploit our asylum 
laws. 
I wanted to ask, are they verifying 
that a child actually belongs to an 
adult? Are they doing DNA tests? If so, 
what percentage of those are actual 
family units? 
I wanted to know whether he was 
aware of the fact that human traf-
fickers throw children out of rafts 
when they are interdicted by law en-
forcement. 
I don’t have the picture here. I hon-
estly wouldn’t even want to show it. I 
showed it in our committee hearing 3 
or 4 years ago. It was hard enough 
showing it at that point in time. It was 
a father and his 2-year-old daughter 
who drowned in the Rio Grande. 
I went down to the border with 18 of 
my Republican Senate colleagues. We 
saw a dead body floating in the Rio 
Grande the day after a 9-year-old girl 
drowned in the Rio Grande. I wanted to 
know whether Secretary Mayorkas, 
whether President Biden, whether Vice 
President Harris was aware of this. 
I wanted to know whether the Sec-
retary was aware of the fact that mi-
grant girls are given birth control be-
cause they know that such a large per-
centage will be raped during the dan-
gerous journey when they are put in 
the hands of these human traffickers. 
I wanted to know whether the Sec-
retary is aware of the kidnappings and 
the beatings, the abuse, the additional 
ransoms demanded by human traf-
fickers. 
I wanted to know whether he knows 
how 
much 
the 
human 
traffickers 
charge for their human prey and 
whether he is knowledgeable of how 
that debt is paid off. You realize the 
border is almost 100 percent secure on 
the Mexican side of the border. Nobody 
crosses into America without either 
paying the human traffickers or being 
indebted to them. I wanted to know 
whether the Secretary knew how they 
pay off those debts. 
I wanted to know whether he knew 
how many young girls are forced into 
the sex trade and how many young men 
are forced into involuntary servitude, 
used to traffic drugs, or become part of 
gangs. 
I wanted to know whether the Sec-
retary—I would like to know whether 
the chairman of our committee is 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
President 
Biden’s policies created this crisis, and 
they are facilitating the multibillion- 
dollar business model of probably some 
of the most evil people on the planet. 
I wanted to know, but I didn’t get a 
chance to ask those questions. 
Beyond the human toll, beyond the 
human tragedy, from a standpoint of 
legislation, what is the real tragedy is 
that we were so close to taking that 
first step, that necessary step of mak-
ing America confident that we are tak-
ing border security seriously, that we 
will secure our border, because until we 
do that, we really can’t move on. With-
out creating greater incentives, we

can’t move on to fix the problem of 
DACA; we can’t set up a legal immigra-
tion system that works best for every-
one. 
You know, it is not good for Central 
America. I have been there. I have 
talked to their Presidents. They ask us 
to fix their laws. It is not good that 
their countries are being depleted of 
the people they need to rebuild their 
economies. It is not good for them. It is 
not good for us. It is certainly not good 
for the migrants who are put in the 
hands of the most evil people on the 
planet and left to their tender mercies. 
We were so close. President Trump 
had stopped the flow, largely, of unac-
companied children, of family units, 
and he was doing the final step, which 
was complete the wall. Walls work. 
Take a look at what happened here 
after January 6—double layers of fenc-
ing, concertina wire tipped. We obvi-
ously thought they worked here for us 
in Congress; they will work at the bor-
der as well. 
What my amendment would do is 
simply complete the wall that Presi-
dent Trump started. He wanted to 
build 800 miles; he built 450. Two hun-
dred and fifty miles of that wall has al-
ready been contracted for. It will be 
paid for whether it is built or not. 
About 100 miles wasn’t contracted. 
So, American taxpayer, you need to 
understand this: You will be on the 
hook for a couple billion dollars, you 
know, tens of thousands of tons of steel 
that has already been produced. All 
that waste—all that waste, and we 
won’t even get the 250 miles of wall. 
Isn’t that absurd? Isn’t that ridiculous? 
All because securing the border has be-
come a partisan issue, when it was not 
a partisan issue in 2006. 
So my amendment, amendment 1518, 
is really pretty simple, just two pages. 
It is very common sense. It just says: 
Complete the wall that we have al-
ready contracted for, that we are going 
to have to pay for whether we build it 
or not. 
Now, in a rational Senate in reason-
able times, this ought to pass 100 to 0. 
I fear this is going to be decided strict-
ly on party lines, and that is a real 
shame. 
If there is one thing that we ought to 
be bipartisan about, it is about na-
tional security, it is about securing our 
homeland, and part and parcel of secur-
ing our homeland is having a secure 
border. One element of that, in addi-
tion to instituting consequences, like 
the Migrant Protection Protocol, like 
something I proposed with the Senator 
from Arizona, Senator SINEMA, Oper-
ation Safe Return, there has to be a 
consequence to reduce or stop this 
flow. 
But we also need barriers. Tech-
nology alone is not going to work. We 
can’t 
hire 
enough 
Border 
Patrol 
agents. They are already being dis-
pirited. We are going to have a hard 
time hiring enough people just to come 
up to the quota levels we want to hire. 
We can’t do it with personnel. We can’t 
do technology. We need the fence. We 
bought and paid for it; let’s construct 
it.

AMENDMENT NO. 1518 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in opposition to the Johnson 
amendment. 
The amendment would force the con-
tinued payment of government con-
tractors to build an ill-conceived bor-
der wall. 
Most of these funds were never in-
tended for this purpose. More than $10 
billion was redirected from the Depart-
ment of Defense. These funds were in-
tended for military missions and func-
tions, such as schools for military fam-
ilies and National Guard equipment. 
The Biden administration is con-
ducting a comprehensive review of 
these contracts, led by the Depart-
ments of Defense and Homeland Secu-
rity. These decisions will be guided by 
what is best for our national security, 
not well-connected government con-
tractors profiting off of hard-earned 
taxpayer dollars. 
We need to move forward with smart, 
bipartisan investments to improve bor-
der security that secure both our 
southern and our northern borders, not 
look backwards at the former adminis-
tration’s boondoggle.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask 
for a minute to respond. 
First of all, let me reiterate—the dol-
lars will be spent regardless. The dol-
lars would be completely wasted and no 
wall whatsoever. Of course, this recon-
sideration of their policies—we can al-
ready see the disastrous consequences 
of what they have already done. God 
help us in terms of what the results 
will be of future policies as well. 
So, again, I ask that my amendment

S. 1260 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to continue our 
discussion about the Endless Frontier 
Act and why America needs to make 
more investment in the areas of re-
search and development for our Nation. 
This is critically important as we have 
gone through this debate with some of 
our colleagues, to talk about why this 
is important for the United States. I 
spent 
my 
time 
yesterday—maybe 
somebody from the staff can come over 
and help me with the charts but, thank 
you—the biggest reason we are doing 
this is because we believe in American 
know-how, that is we believe in Amer-
ican ingenuity and we believe in Amer-
ican know-how and we have discussed 
already how that has helped to build 
our country over and over and over 
again, that we are a nation of, if you 
will, explorers, of pioneers, and by ne-
cessity, inventors, and that has contin-
ued throughout the history of our 
country. 
So we are so proud to continue to 
make these investments in all areas of 
science, certainly in the areas of 
healthcare, but we are more specifi-
cally talking about the engineers of 
the physical science and engineering. 
And we are talking about why we 
should make an increase in both basic 
research with this underlying bill that 
continues to drive dollars into curi-
osity driven early stage research, so 
that we can continue to grow jobs and 
help our economy, and it also con-
tinues the effort by saying we should 
make more investments in STEM edu-
cation, so the workforce that it will 
take for us to meet the job challenges 
of the future. So we are excited that we 
are there with American know-how, 
but we are also cognizant of this inter-
national debate that is going on, the 
debate about other countries and what 
they are investing in research and de-
velopment. And one of the reasons why 
I like where we are in the United 
States is because our research and de-
velopment ecosystem is really an eco-
system of many different agencies 
doing research and development. 
And not only are those research and 
development investments by these var-
ious agencies helping in particular 
areas—because it is really distributed 
as this chart shows, the United States 
works with the private sector, it works 
with our public universities, and it 
works with various agencies. Instead of 
a centralized approach that you might 
find in other countries, the fact that 
we have this distributed ecosystem 
with, you know, the Department of En-
ergy may collaborate with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, they may collabo-
rate with the Department of Defense, 
NSF may collaborate with universities, 
universities may collaborate with the 
private sector—it is an ecosystem, and 
that ecosystem is what is unique about 
research 
and 
development 
in 
the 
United States. It is not hierarchical, it 
is not the majority driven by the pri-
vate sector, or by government, it is an 
ecosystem, and the fact that it is so 
distributed. That means, almost like 
the competition in various places, and 
the collaboration is helping us grow 
the innovation economy. 
So the one thing that we need to be 
cognizant of in this debate is that we 
want to preserve that. We want to pre-
serve the uniqueness of our ecosystem. 
And that is why we are really talking 
today about this NSF, the National 
Science Foundation, principally, and 
you can see from this big pie we just 
had this debate, right, we had this de-
bate, well, let’s increase the defense 
R&D—well, we are already doing a lot 
in defense R&D, of course, our col-
leagues are talking about the budget 
overall as it related to defense, but you 
can see that NSF, the numbers that 
they are at today at 6.8 are not really 
at the—you know, you might think 
this whole debate we are spending, you 
know, billions of dollars to change the 
focus. This agency is a powerhouse, and 
it is a powerhouse mostly connected 
with universities, and the R&D that is 
done there has been in the basic re-
search area. 
But now, this bill by our colleagues 
Senators SCHUMER and YOUNG is about 
taking the basic research, continuing 
that, making a little bit of investment 
in that basic research, but then also 
now trying to accelerate all the re-
search that we now have at our hands, 
our fingertips, at our minds, and say-
ing, What other user-based research 
can we take, that basic and applied re-
search, and actually put it into use in 
commercialization 
in 
the 
United 
States? 
So if you will, capitalizing on a faster 
tech transfer and a faster deployment 
of these technologies—why is this so 
important? Well, it is important be-
cause, in the information age, a lot of 
people can read our published research 
and development, they can read what 
we are doing, and they can continue 
their research and development. Other 
nations are figuring out that research 
and development in an information age 
economy really does matter. They are 
figuring out that the United States has 
come a long way as a nation in build-
ing job growth, maintaining competi-
tiveness, national security issues, all 
because we at the Federal Government 
level have said we believe in research 
and development with the public tax-
payer dollars and it has benefited, 
whether it is the internet or the bio 
sciences and healthcare or on national 
security, the American public gets that 
that research has made us competitive 
as a nation. 
So we have had two previous at-
tempts to make investments in this 
issue in America COMPETES, first 
started in the Bush administration in

May 20, 2021 
2006 when President Bush published a 
report about America’s competitive-
ness and proposed this concept of that 
small NSF budget that I was referring 
to, and articulated that we needed to 
double that budget within a 5-year or 7- 
year window of time. They felt that, 
with the level of change and trans-
formation and innovation, that we 
wouldn’t be keeping pace on a global 
basis unless we made that investment. 
So in 2007 we passed the America 
COMPETES Act which gave money 
both to NSF and to DOE, and literally 
the first 3 years, we thought we were 
going to double this DOE budget and 
an investment in DOE within 7 years. 
So there was a little good news, a lot of 
euphoria in R&D, a lot of hope for 
STEM education, science, technology, 
engineering, and math. And then, in 
America COMPETES, the same request 
basically of a 60/40 split between NSF 
and energy, people thought we would 
end up—well, we are not on pace, where 
we want to be, but, oh, we will get 
there within 11 years. Well, we will put 
enough money into this innovation ef-
fort that we will double our research 
and innovation budget as it relates to 
NSF and our energy innovation efforts 
in 11 years. 
Well, this is what really happened. 
We didn’t do either of those things. We 
are really on a track to have taken 
those 2007 numbers and double them in 
22 years. So when you look back at the 
history and you say, Well, how did we— 
what happened? If we are so enthusi-
astic about this, if we identify this— 
both a Republican President identified 
this and then a Democratic administra-
tion followed up, why didn’t we execute 
on this? Why didn’t we execute on this 
doubling of this number and making 
this investment? 
Well, we all know what happened, we 
basically hit a recession. And in a re-
cession of 2009 and 2010, we just didn’t 
live up to this obligation of funding the 
research and development that was in 
America COMPETES to the aggressive-
ness that we had all hoped for. I am not 
sure everybody even realizes that this 
effort fell short, that we didn’t make 
quite the level of investment that we 
wanted, that we were falling behind. I 
don’t think anybody really understood 
it until now, when people see the in-
credible level of international competi-
tion. All of a sudden, as we see this in-
credible investment from the inter-
national community, people are start-
ing to say, Well wait, what have we 
done on this effort? 
So our next chart shows the fact that 
the United States has been a leader in 
global research and development, and 
as I said, I mentioned on the floor a re-
port that was done by the Pew Chari-
table Trust—I mean the Pew Research 
Center, that basically said 7 in 10 
Americans believe in public investment 
in research and development. We have 
a higher regard for this than other na-
tions, and we just do, I think, because 
people get it here, I think they get that 
we have invented a lot of things, they 
believe in that innovation, they know 
it creates jobs. And so we have a higher 
regard for that, and consequently, we 
have been the leader in world R&D for 
a very, very long time. But as this In-
formation age has come along, other 
nations get that R&D leads to job cre-
ation, transformation, and certainly to 
security. So just since 1991, we have 
seen China who was ninth in R&D— 
now, they are No. 2, and I am pretty 
sure, at current trajectories, will end 
up being No. 1 sometime very, very 
soon. 
And so it is, you know, not every-
thing about China, although many of 
my colleagues here are going to discuss 
this is a China bill, I view it as a bill 
about the future and making the in-
vestments in the future to capture the 
economic opportunities. There are se-
curity issues here, clearly national se-
curity issues here. There are clearly 
issues about a supply chain and wheth-
er you can depend on a supply chain 
and whether, if you have a concentra-
tion of an industry in one region of the 
world, then are you really dependent 
on that one region of the world for that 
particular product? 
What happened to all of us in the last 
year and a half—and I am saying now 
on a global basis—is the world commu-
nity realized with COVID, well, wait, 
supply chains really matter, product 
really matters, where we get product in 
an emergency really matters, whether 
it does what it says it does in an emer-
gency really matters. And so all of 
these issues about supply chains and 
who is building what and the intrica-
cies of it really got ripped open in the 
COVID debate, and now, we are really, 
as the world community starts to look 
at this too, where do we get our prod-
uct, who is making it, is it made to the 
standard that we want, is it secure? 
And obviously, you know, people have 
made lots of decisions about supply 
chain based on just pure cost and effec-
tiveness of a product, but now, people 
are starting to realize that it is way 
more complex, and it has led us to this 
current debate. 
So again, why do we do this, why 
does America want to make an invest-
ment in an innovation economy? Well, 
we don’t have to go too far to under-
stand that from our past history. It en-
ables competitiveness, and if you just 
think about, you know these sectors–I 
will never forget years ago we had 
somebody—this was in the ’80s, visit 
Seattle, and they said, Well, what is 
everybody going to do, make car 
phones and computers? And in reality, 
there was a big decade or so of making 
what then was supposed to be great 
technology of a car phone, and obvi-
ously, we all know where we have now 
been with computers and operating 
systems and how much it drives the 
economy of the future, but at the time 
when we were seeing a transformation 
to that, people just thought, Well, 
what are we all going to do? Is that 
what we are going to do? Well, tele-
communication, semiconductors, ad-
vanced materials, all were huge things 
that enabled this competitiveness of 
our Nation–in automobiles, in aviation, 
in the tech sector, in healthcare, in a 
whole variety of things. And it drives 
our economy with this level of innova-
tion. 
The internet, just one example, is 
something we started working on in 
the ’60s, became a reality in the ’90s, 
and today, it is $2.3 trillion part of our 
national economy, and 12 percent of 
U.S. GDP. That is what we got out of 
previous research. That is what we got 
out of saying we are going to let sci-
entists do basic research and figure out 
what they think are the most impor-
tant advances moving forward. The job 
growth, millions of jobs, and national 
security today, we can see just from 
this past week in a pipeline that was 
affected by a cyber attack, we cannot 
afford to take our foot off of national 
security research and development in 
the purposes of things like cyber secu-
rity. 
We have to continue to be a leader in 
this area of technology. It is not as if 
you are not going to have intimidation 
of our Nation by somebody maybe 
sticking the nose of a foreign sub in 
U.S. waters or flying a spy plane over 
the United States, it is going to come 
in the form of intimidation of our 
banking system, or pipelines, or other 
senses of security and hacking. And so 
there is no doubt—no doubt—we need 
to stay on top of the level of invest-
ment in national security. I would say 
the underlying bill that we will be 
talking about next week in detail re-
lates to a very important aspect of na-
tional security, and that is the area of 
semiconductors. We need to make an 
investment in our competitiveness in 
semiconductors, and we need to make 
that investment because it is going to 
be critical to our national security. 
So let me talk about a few things 
that are in the bill, just so people un-
derstand some of the priorities that 
Majority Leader SCHUMER and Senator 
YOUNG came up with as it relates to 
this legislation. As I mentioned, it cre-
ates a new Tech Directorate in the of-
fice of NSF, the National Science 
Foundation, so that it will be like a 
DARPA system, that is, that they 
work with the private sector, they cre-
ate technology centers, they build 
partnerships between government and 
academia, they support rapid tech-
nology demonstration, they advance 
the competitiveness of the United 
States in important fields like artifi-
cial intelligence quantum computing, 
biotechnology, and they focus on these 
ideas, similar to how DARPA has done, 
where the individuals involved are crit-
ical to the effort, that is to say, to get 
the best and brightest minds who are 
working in these areas to be part of 
this effort and concentration. 
We also looked at and improved in 
this legislation the fact that univer-
sities and academia provide a lot of re-
search and development, but often-
times, don’t even—in the academia 
world, people are focused on pub-
lishing. Publishing their research, that

is kind of how they get known, that is 
what they get basically almost re-
warded for at the university system, 
and you will be surprised how little 
time they take to actually take that 
research, turn it into a patent, and 
then turn it into a commercialized 
product. 
So one thing we heard in our hear-
ings is that we needed to give more 
help to universities on tech transfer 
and patenting of information. Why pat-
enting? Because patenting helps us pro-
tect the science that we already have 
developed. It helps us—say that some-
body can’t just take that published 
science report and then go off in an-
other country and develop it because it 
is now protected under our U.S. law. So 
we feel this is a very important effort, 
and we think that it also helps lead a 
lot of research at universities to then 
be supported, developed, exposed to the 
venture capital markets and thus actu-
ally helped turn into commercializa-
tion. 
So efforts at the University of Wash-
ington that specifically focused on 
this, specifically hired somebody to 
come into the university and kind of, if 
you will, shake the tree of the level of 
R&D that was being done and say, 
What are we doing to actually patent 
this content, what are we doing to ac-
tually transfer it into commercializa-
tion, had outstanding results? Yes, it 
was a transformation of what our uni-
versities do, but in the end, they came 
up with something like, just in a few 
years, 20 companies that ended up be-
coming been, you know, supported by 
venture capitalists and making it on to 
the markets. So we are very excited 
that we will now, with this provision, 
be trying to get more out of the re-
search we do, by patenting it and doing 
tech transfer. 
Our colleagues Senators YOUNG and 
SCHUMER also believe that university 
research should continue to get invest-
ments, and that is the major aspect of 
the provision here is to have the Tech 
Directorate work on these 10 areas of 
expertise, work with selected univer-
sities around the United States on this 
critical focus of technology. I men-
tioned some of them: artificial intel-
ligence, 
quantum 
computing, 
bio-
technology, and many others. 
So the fact that the bill really is de-
pending on our university system, I 
think, is something that our colleagues 
should applaud and be excited about. 
That chart that I showed at the begin-
ning where everybody is working to-
gether, this is just research dollars 
going to the best universities in our 
Nation to continue to focus on this, but 
now focus on it in partnership with ex-
perts in these sectors and with indus-
try so that we can actually get to a 
faster adoption rate and a faster imple-
mentation into commercial markets. 
So I think we are leaning in to our uni-
versity system. 
That is a good idea. 
That is a good idea. What we are giv-
ing the university system, though, is 
the tools, the tools to help accelerate 
that development. And then, as I men-
tioned, we are also making a huge in-
vestment in STEM, more than $10 bil-
lion into STEM education. The chart I 
showed before talked about how we 
were going to do all these great things 
under America COMPETES in STEM. 
We didn’t quite get there. We didn’t 
really do that. I think this is like 
broadband. Everybody talks about it 
all the time, we think we have solved it 
five times, and you still think, Wait, I 
thought we solved broadband? 
STEM is the same thing. You think 
we have funded STEM. We haven’t 
funded STEM. This represents a huge 
increase in our STEM education budg-
et, but I will just tell you, this is so 
that we can get the researchers, the 
scientists, the fellows, if you will, at 
the higher education level for STEM. 
We still need to go and build the pipe-
line at our K–12 system so that we are 
putting more people into the pipeline. 
But hopefully, with the STEM dollars 
here, we will be, if you will, creating a 
new workforce for the innovation that 
we are trying to chase with the invest-
ments of these dollars. 
And we felt so strongly about this 
that we looked at the numbers and we 
were just astonished. There are so few 
women 
and 
minorities 
in 
STEM 
fields—so few. The underlying bill our 
colleagues, 
Senator 
SCHUMER
and 
YOUNG, created a diversity office at, for 
the first time, over at NSF so they can 
focus on this issue. We put more re-
sources to it within this STEM cat-
egory so our colleagues and those at 
NSF could focus on it. And we expect 
to really try to take a very aggressive 
role here. That is what we heard from 
NSF in their research. 
STEM education can’t be a passive 
thing. It can’t be just, We are going to 
put some more dollars out for edu-
cation. If we want to diversify in the 
sciences, we have to have a very, very 
aggressive approach. And so that ag-
gressive approach means changing the 
faces of those who do the education, 
changing some of the faces of people 
who do investments, changing the dy-
namics of research. A lot of women 
were hurt in the last COVID pandemic 
who were researchers because they 
were juggling both taking care of their 
families or taking care of parents and 
doing their research. And so they had 
extra strains on them that made com-
plexity to when they could get their re-
search done. 
So we know we have to think about 
STEM education from the perspective 
of what are some of the challenges that 
face people going into those fields. But 
no doubt, this underlying legislation 
before us will have a big investment in 
that and continue NSF’s leadership in 
trying to grow a more aggressive work-
force. So the bill also includes, I should 
say, a few things about how one of our 
goals is to diversify innovation to 
many different parts of the United 
States. The challenge there is, you 
know, you are not going to sprinkle 
some dust on some magic words on 
some region of the United States, and 
all of a sudden, something is going to 
pop up–and nor do I personally expect 
it to. I always give the example of 
Walla Walla, which is a real place, 
Walla Walla, WA. I had a journalist ask 
once if that was a real place. 
Yes, it is a real place. It is a great 
wine-making 
place. 
But 
somebody 
might say, Walla Walla, WA, should be 
a research center. It has got a univer-
sity, an outstanding university, Whit-
man. People might say it should be a 
tech hub or it should be a research cen-
ter. Walla Walla found its rightful 
place when research was done, and a 
university professor at the University 
of Washington said, You know what, we 
can grow wine grapes. That really 
wasn’t that long ago. That was in the 
1980s. He said we can grow grapes. We 
weren’t growing grapes. Now, a couple 
of decades later, we have over a thou-
sand wineries in the State of Wash-
ington. So not everybody is going to be 
a tech hub, but it doesn’t mean that 
you’re not going to use science to the 
best and highest use for a region of 
your State or the country. 
It is about empowering. As Director 
Panchanathan, the head of NSF says, 
it is about trying to have innovation 
everywhere, connected to opportunity 
everywhere, connected to universities. 
The point is let’s build a better eco-
system that goes all throughout the 
United States so more and more people 
can take advantage of technology and 
innovation. So this is really, really im-
portant because we never know where 
the next person is going to come from, 
who is going to play a critical role in 
technology. And the more we build this 
infrastructure, the better. 
So this allows money for regional 
technology hubs to help concentrate in 
various parts of the country and exper-
tise, more money for our manufac-
turing institutes which help manufac-
turers all across the United States 
focus on being competitive in their 
particular area, and it supports $2.4 bil-
lion for manufacturing extension pro-
grams, which are those things that 
really do work with, say, a particular 
sector like automobiles or aviation or 
some other type of manufacturing and 
help make them competitive. And as 
mentioned, it also, just like in the 
former COMPETES Act bills, puts 
some money into DOE. In this case, it 
puts about $17 billion into the Depart-
ment of Energy so that its energy inno-
vation can move forward. 
So let me talk for a second about this 
issue 
about 
national 
security 
and 
where we are with semiconductors be-
cause I expect this will get a bunch of 
focus next week as we talk about this 
legislation. The underlying bill has 
about $52 billion of investment for the 
semiconductor industry, so I am pretty 
sure people think, Well, wait, this is a 
lot of money, but it is a very big sec-
tor. 
It is essential to our defense, it is es-
sential to navigation, it is essential to

satellites, it is essential to healthcare, 
it is essential to consumer products. 
And the United States has been a lead-
er in this area. The United States has 
been a leader in this area for a long 
time—or I should say, was a leader in 
this area for a long time, when you 
think of companies like Intel or others, 
even some of the companies that are 
foreign investors who made huge foot-
prints in the United States. But the 
point is that we are no longer in this 
position—as this chart shows, only 12 
percent of a global supply. 
A report recently done on the semi-
conductor industry by Boston Con-
sulting Group, I just want to read this 
one part: ‘‘The U.S. has been the long- 
standing global leader in semiconduc-
tors with 45% to 50% share of the 
worldwide market’’ 5-percent to 50-per-
cent share of the worldwide market— 
‘‘in the last 30 years. However, signifi-
cant focus is being placed on ending 
the U.S. share in semiconductor manu-
facturing which now only stands at 12% 
installed capacity.’’ This is a report 
that I am pretty sure you could get on-
line. That is the end of that statement. 
So we have gone from 45 percent to 50 
percent, that is where we started out, 
and over the last 30 years, now, we are 
down to 12 percent–12 percent. So I ask 
my colleagues, if you were 12 percent of 
anything, how long would you be 
around to be competitive? How long 
would you drive the supply chain? How 
long would you drive job growth? How 
long would you continue to be competi-
tive in this very, very important sector 
that is important to all of these 
things? 
And while I am somebody who sup-
ports continued growth of our global 
economy because I think we build and 
make great things and we want people 
to sell them to, this presents to us a 
very unique challenge, the fact that 
something as critical to the informa-
tion age as semiconductors, we have 
gone from 40 percent to 50 percent 
down to 12 percent the question is what 
is going to happen next. 
Well, the question of what is going to 
happen next is, if we don’t make this 
investment, very, very likely that that 
12 percent is going to, in the next sev-
eral years, turn into 6 percent. It is 
going to turn into 6 percent. So staying 
status quo right now, doing no invest-
ment, it is very likely that 12 percent 
will turn into 6 percent, which means 
people aren’t going to want to locate 
their boundaries in the United States. 
People aren’t going to want to locate 
their research in the United States— 
people aren’t going to want to have 
their companies and the supply chain 
and the workforce. Literally, this in-
dustry simply is clusters, it is clusters. 
Seattle didn’t get to be Seattle over-
night. Seattle didn’t get to be the hub 
of the No. 1 STEM city in the United 
States of America and certainly an epi-
center of software and software devel-
opment overnight. 
It took decades—decades. Literally, 
you know, even in the 1980s and 1990s, 
it wasn’t that diversified. It has just 
been in the last 15 years that it has 
really diversified. But, yes, it took the 
work of the University of Washington. 
Yes, it took the work of many compa-
nies being there. Then it took the work 
of then people attracting a workforce 
who would rather be there than, say, in 
Silicon Valley. And then it took the ef-
forts of universities to produce a work-
force. Then it took attracting venture 
capital. 
Then once they got venture capital, 
then more companies wanted to come 
there because then you have the entire 
ecosystem. You had universities, you 
had venture capital, you had leading 
companies, you had a workforce, and 
you had all of this stuff. Well, that is 
in software, and software can continue 
to move forward, but if you didn’t have 
those things, you aren’t going to be a 
cluster for semiconductors. The United 
States of America—the cluster of semi-
conductor development is going to be 
in Asia. It is going to be in Korea. It is 
going to be in Taiwan, and it is going 
to be in China. 
So we have to ask ourselves if we are 
only 6 percent of the supply in the fu-
ture and we can’t really control the de-
velopment and we lose our edge in this 
and then basically we have to rely on a 
supply chain for all the chips, you 
know, in the world, where is the supply 
chain that we are going to rely on for 
the national security products and de-
fense technology and satellites and 
maybe some of these other consumer 
products that then end up getting used 
for other purposes? That is what this 
debate is about. 
It is about that we went from 45 per-
cent to 50 percent down to 12 percent. 
If we do nothing, we are going to 6 per-
cent, and the epicenter of a critical 
technology is going to move to Asia. 
So I personally want to see us be suc-
cessful in keeping a sector in the 
United States. I am very proud that 
that same Boston report shows that we 
have 49 percent of the aerospace manu-
facturing market in the United States. 
I am very proud of that because we are 
an epicenter of that. Forty-nine per-
cent of the manufacturing market for 
aerospace is in the United States. 
That represents, to my region, maybe 
150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the Northwest. 
To the United States, that is 2 million 
jobs—more than 2 million probably if 
you think about some of the other re-
lated sectors. So being 49 percent of the 
supply chain in the United States for 
aerospace really, really, really mat-
ters. And I don’t want to see that slip. 
You know, we have had a discussion 
about the fact that we have the Jones 
Act. 
Now, some of our colleagues might 
not support the Jones Act, but the 
Jones Act is we decide, Well, we are 
not going to be all the shipbuilding in 
the world. Shipbuilding is going to get 
built in other places. But, oh, my gosh, 
we have to have enough shipbuilding in 
the United States so if we are at war, 
products and services that we need to 
support our military can be trans-
ported on U.S. vessels. That is why we 
have the Jones Act because we decided 
that that sector was critical enough to 
support. 
And what we are saying here is that 
this sector is critical enough to sup-
port, too. I don’t know that we are ever 
going to be 49 percent like aerospace 
manufacturing is—probably not, prob-
ably because it would take a lot more 
money than we are talking about 
here—because the rest of this world is 
chasing this market, too. They are 
chasing it fast and furious. We have to 
ask ourselves, Do we want to end up at 
6 percent, or are we want going to try 
to reverse this trend and make an in-
vestment and make it as smart as pos-
sible? 
I thought we had one more chart, but 
I guess we don’t. So I guess we are back 
to this. Is this bill’s investment worth 
taking the chance on American know- 
how? Is it worth the history of our 
country and saying, We have done a lot 
in research and development, and we 
know how to get things done. When I 
think of some of the people in this 
story, I think one of the guys on the GI 
Bill was one of the first contributors to 
semiconductors. It is a guy who basi-
cally went to school on a GI Bill, and if 
you think about the capital formation 
and capital markets we have in the 
United States, it has contributed to al-
lowing that technology to move more 
rapidly. Our investment in higher edu-
cation has allowed this to move more 
rapidly. 
So to my colleagues who aren’t sure 
about this legislation or think that it 
sounds like a lot or thinks that it 
sounds like, Oh, I don’t understand it, 
it is really quite simple. Do you want 
to make a bigger investment in our 
contribution to American know-how 
with research and development and let 
them compete to winning the next gen-
eration of jobs? I do. I do. 
I want to do that because I want to 
see what comes next. I think it is one 
of the most exciting things about 
today and where we live today. We are 
not in the agrarian age; we are not in 
the industrial age. We are in the infor-
mation age where everything can be 
created in the blink of an eye and now 
distributed and transform our economy 
in such significant ways. I want to see 
what comes next. But we can’t do it by 
passing legislation, authorizing things 
and then not appropriating the money 
and then waking up in 10 years and 
finding that we are at the lowest per-
centage of research and development to 
GDP in 60 years. That is where we are, 
the lowest percentage. So we can’t do 
that. We have to make these invest-
ments and if we invest in American 
know-how, the rest of this will take 
care of itself. 
I yield the floor.

received H.R. 1318 and the text being 
identical to S. 593 as passed by the Sen-
ate, H.R. 1318 is considered read three 
times and passed, and the motion to re-
consider is considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The bill (H.R. 1318) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. 
SULLIVAN. 
Mr. 
President, 
thank you for passing that very impor-
tant piece of legislation. 
The official name of that legislation 
that just passed the Senate is the Alas-
ka Tourism Restoration Act. This is a 
really good day for Alaska right now 
and for our small businesses and work-
ing families and the overall economy 
in Alaska, across our State. 
I want to say this is also a good day 
for the Congress. Both Houses, over the 
last week, have been able to come to-
gether, Members on both sides of the 
aisle, when they recognized that a rel-
atively narrow segment of this great 
Nation—my 
State, 
Senator 
MUR-
KOWSKI’s State—had a huge challenge 
right now with our economy relating 
to tourism. Senators and Members of 
the House worked together, and we just 
passed a piece of legislation that is 
going to the President’s desk. It is 
really going to help. 
This pandemic has really hurt a lot 
of our economies in different States. I 
would say the Alaskan economy has 
been really hammered—the energy sec-
tor, the commercial fishing sector, and, 
of course, our tourism sector. But we 
have hope. 
As I mentioned, we just passed the 
Alaska Tourism Restoration Act. This 
bill, cosponsored by Senator MUR-
KOWSKI and myself here in the Senate 
and Congressman YOUNG in the House, 
is going to give our tourism season and 
the tens of thousands of Alaskans in 
that industry and the hundreds, if not 
thousands, of small businesses in Alas-
ka in that industry that are hanging by 
a thread—it is going to give them a 
fighting chance this summer. 
These are businesses whose owners 
have put their life savings, their hard 
work, their hopes, and their dreams 
into these small businesses, and many 
have been on the brink financially be-
cause of the pandemic and because the 
short cruise ship season that drives the 
tourism economy in Alaska was about 
to be canceled again this summer. That 
is now not going to happen. 
Think about these numbers. In 2020, 
last year, during the pandemic, Alaska 
was estimated to get—we were sup-
posed to get, prior to the pandemic, a 
record number of tourists via cruise 
ships: 1.5 million. It would have been 
the alltime record. Of course, in 2020, 
with the pandemic, none of them 
showed up, not one, and 2021 was shap-
ing up to be the same. 
Think about that. These small busi-
nesses get almost all their revenue dur-
ing the summer season. That would 
have been 2 years with no revenues. No 
small business can withstand that. 
So 2021 was looking to be canceled 
again as a result of the CDC, which 
took too long to provide clear guidance 
to the cruise ship industry, but they 
are now working cooperatively with 
our communities back home in Alaska 
and the industry. So that is good news. 
That is starting to happen. It is really 
important. 
But even with the CDC cooperating 
and working constructively, which is 
now happening, 2021 wasn’t looking 
good anyway because of a law—dating 
back to the 1880s, by the way—a U.S. 
law that made it impossible, without 
Canada’s cooperation, to sail to Alaska 
on a cruise ship. It was impossible un-
less we got a bill from Congress passed 
that would allow cruise ships to sail to 
Alaska without stopping at a Canadian 
port, and that is just what we did. That 
is just what we did. 
I want to thank, again, Members of 
the House and Members of the Senate. 
We are hoping that this bill is now 
going down to the White House for a 
signing by the President as soon as 
possible. 
I know I am speaking on behalf of 
Senator MURKOWSKI and Congressman 
YOUNG in thanking all the Members of 
this body and the House for that work. 
We are going to have a fighting chance 
in Alaska for a summer tourism season 
that was looking very dismal just a 
couple of weeks ago. 
One of the reasons it was looking 
very dismal is unfortunately because of 
our neighbor, who hasn’t been really 
helpful. In Alaska, we have one neigh-
bor, if you don’t count Russia, and that 
is Canada. We don’t have our wonderful 
lower 48 State neighbors; we have Can-
ada. 
We read in the Canadian press the 
last several weeks that there was no 
way the Americans could get their act 
together to pass a law that would fully 
bypass Canada—no way. That is what 
the Canadians were saying, Canadian 
politicians. So there wasn’t a lot of 
need to work with us. 
Well, here is a message for Canada: 
Never bet against America. Never bet 
against America. Pretty much every 
country in the history of our country’s 
history that has bet against us has 
lost. 
I would say that our delegation, the 
Alaska delegation, is probably the 
most pro-Canadian delegation there is. 
It is certainly more knowledgeable 
than most on Canadian issues. We work 
together on all kinds of things, big and 
small—trade issues, military issues, 
NORAD issues, mining issues. We, in 
my view, have a typically great rela-
tionship. 
Alaska-Canada 
is 
really 
strong. But that relationship needs co-
operation, collaboration, and on this 
issue, it really didn’t happen. So next 
time we ask our Canadian colleagues 
for cooperation, we think that is im-
portant, but we didn’t need it, ulti-
mately. 
So I mention in closing, good news 
for Alaska. But I will say this to any-
one watching on TV: This is good news 
for America. Why is that? Here is a 
message for the rest of our beautiful 
country: Alaska is open for business. 
Come on up. We are safe. We are 
healthy. 
By the way, if you come up, you can 
get a vaccine. It is open to all tourists. 
We are beautiful—breaching whales, 
soaring mountains, salmon-choked riv-
ers, the best people in the world. 
It has been a tough year. Now, I am 
not just talking Alaska; I am talking 
the whole country. We know it. Every-
body has been at home. 
To our fellow Americans who are 
ready to get out and see our beautiful 
Nation, come on up and see one of the 
most beautiful parts of America—real-
ly, one of the most beautiful parts of 
the world. Come on up to Alaska. We 
are waiting there for you. If it is on 
your bucket list, there is no time like 
the present to do it. Get on a cruise 
ship. Fly up. I think the Canadians 
have still blocked the border, so it is 
hard to drive up. That is a whole other 
issue. But there will be cruise ships 
heading up to the great State of Alas-
ka, hopefully by mid-July. In fact, I 
have a call with several cruise ship ex-
ecutives this afternoon, and I am going 
to encourage them, in the aftermath of 
the U.S. Congress passing this bill, en-
courage them to rev up their cruise 
ships and get up to Alaska soon. We 
know that demand is high. 
To all Americans, we would love to 
have you. 
In closing, to my fellow Alaskans, 
while this tourism season certainly 
won’t be one of our biggest—it cer-
tainly won’t be like what we were an-
ticipating in 2020—we are confident 
now, with this action, there will be 
ships, and there will be people. Help is 
on the way. We are a resilient, strong, 
tough State. 
Thank you, Alaskans, for your pa-
tience. We now have a fighting chance 
at a decent summer tourism season in 
2021. Hopefully, every American citizen 
watching this will head on up to Alas-
ka. You will have a great time. 
I yield the floor.

ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT— 
Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ
MASTO). The Senator from Vir-
ginia. 
S. 1260 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
rise today in strong support of the End-
less Frontier Act—a long overdue, bi-
partisan effort to invest in our coun-
try’s innovation and competitiveness. 
I am pleased to see that Congress is 
finally taking action to shore up U.S. 
investment in the research, develop-
ment, and manufacturing of critical 
technologies 
because, 
without 
this 
kind of intervention, China in par-
ticular will continue to outpace and 
outperform us in the global technology 
race, impacting our country’s eco-
nomic well-being, our global influence, 
and our national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3188 
May 20, 2021 
Let me note, when I reference China, 
I think it is important that any policy-
maker or business leader draw this dis-
tinction. I want to make clear that my 
beef is with the Communist Party of 
China and the policies of President Xi 
Jinping, which persecutes its own peo-
ple in terms of Uighurs, restricts the 
freedom of the people of Hong Kong, 
and creates a surveillance state that 
would make George Orwell blush. My 
beef is with those policies and that 
party, not with the Chinese people and 
obviously not with the Chinese dias-
pora, particularly Chinese Americans 
and Asian Americans. 
In recent years, China has rapidly 
been executing on a plan. It has been 
working, particularly, to ramp up its 
domestic industries around technology 
that confer potentially to its long-term 
strategic dominance in a whole host of 
industries 
that 
traditionally 
the 
United States or the West has domi-
nated. 
One of the topics I am going to come 
back to in a moment is that of semi-
conductors. 
China 
consistently 
in-
creases its investment in the semicon-
ductor industry, with a commitment to 
invest $150 billion and a goal to 
produce at least 70 percent of the semi-
conductors it consumes—it is one of 
the world’s fastest growing econo-
mies—by 2030. 
Frankly, on this issue of semiconduc-
tors, it is not just China. Look around 
at South Korea, which has pledged to 
invest over $130 billion over the next 9 
years, while training 36,000 new micro-
electronics engineers and technicians. 
Even our allies in Europe—Germany 
and 18 other EU members—recently an-
nounced investments of up to $60 bil-
lion in key hardware like semiconduc-
tors over the next few years. 
We look back and see how we are 
doing in America. By contrast, over 
the past 10 years, only 17 major semi-
conductor fabs, or foundries—these are 
basically 
the 
manufacturing 
facili-
ties—have been built in the United 
States, while we have seen over 122 
built elsewhere. As a matter of fact, 
right now, there is not a single new 
fabrication facility being constructed 
in America. The total number of facili-
ties—fabs, foundries—that are in pro-
duction has gone from 81 down to 76, 
which are some of our older fabrication 
facilities. 
Frankly, the technology has leapt 
forward, and if you don’t continue to 
make the investment, you end up with 
a large, empty facility. We even have 
one right outside of Richmond, in 
Henrico County. 
As a country, our share of semicon-
ductor and microelectronic production 
has gone from 37 percent to just 12 per-
cent today. If you look at China, it is 
almost the exact inverse, going from 
single digits to north of 30 percent. 
The truth is, in the United States, 
the cost of a new fab is about 25 to 50 
percent higher, partially because of the 
lower financial incentives we provide 
and 
the 
appropriate 
environmental 
standards. It does mean that, without 
incentives, we are not going to be in 
the game right now, partially because 
of decisions made right at the begin-
ning of COVID and partially just be-
cause of a semiconductor shortage. We 
have auto factories sitting idle in the 
United States, not because they don’t 
have workers, not because they don’t 
have demand for those automobiles, 
but because these plants can’t obtain 
the semiconductors that are integral to 
automobiles and, for that matter, 
every device we operate. 
At the same time, if we look back 
again at China, it has no plans to take 
the foot off the pedal anytime soon. As 
a matter of fact, last year, President 
Xi Jinping announced a $1.4 trillion 
commitment to develop new tech-
nologies just through 2025—$1.4 tril-
lion. We think about the numbers we 
are talking about here today, which 
are big based upon traditional Amer-
ican standards, but they pale in com-
parison to what China is investing. You 
don’t need to look very far; you only 
need to look at the Chinese documents 
themselves—the Made in China 2025 
plan and the China 2035 plan in terms 
of standards and procedures and proto-
cols. 
Beyond 
semiconductors, 
5G, 
and 
some of the things I have talked about 
in the past, there is a host of other 
areas in which, if we don’t invest, we 
are not going to be able to stand. 
Now, it is not all bleak. U.S. semi-
conductor firms in areas like lithog-
raphy, packaging, and metrology still 
lead the world. In machining, we still 
lead. However, many of the key ingre-
dients to our success, including Federal 
support for R&D, investment in basic 
research, and support for advanced 
manufacturing, have actually declined 
over the last 20 years. 
Simply put, we are just not keeping 
up. Between 1995 and 2018, Chinese R&D 
investment increased by over 15 per-
cent per year compared to the U.S. in-
creases 
averaging 
about 
3-percent 
growth per year. Now, we started with 
a higher base—I acknowledge that—but 
on relative and, shortly, on actual real 
terms, China will soon pass. As a mat-
ter of fact, after World War II, the 
United States funded 69 percent of the 
annual global R&D. Today, we fund 
less than 28 percent, with only 7 per-
cent 
going 
to 
nondefense 
tech-
nologies—again, like wireless, which is 
something I know a little bit about and 
will speak to again in a moment. 
To get back to where we once were 
and reassert U.S. technology leader-
ship, 
we 
need 
to 
reprioritize 
foundational technologies to maintain 
not just our country’s economic leader-
ship but to also make sure that our 
values are built into these increasing 
technology areas. 
The truth is, for so many years, not 
only did we invent many of these 
breakthrough technologies here, but 
even if we didn’t invent them in the 
United States, we would then set the 
rules, the procedures, the protocols, 
and the standards around these new 
technology 
developments. 
We 
have 
seen that in semiconductors for a long 
time. We saw it in computing. We saw 
it with the internet. We saw it in wire-
less. We saw it in satellites. 
Time and again now, we are suddenly 
seeing China flood the zone with these 
standard-setting bodies, and when you 
set the standards, you also reflect your 
values. So values that we bring to the 
table, like transparency and respect for 
human rights, go out the window when 
China sets the rules around 5G that ba-
sically allow traffic to always pass 
through Beijing. Even if you are mak-
ing a phone call between St. Louis and 
San Francisco, why does that traffic 
have to be routed through Beijing un-
less there is a malicious interest at 
stake? If you set the rules, you drive 
not only the technology but so many 
other things. 
As chairman of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence, I have long 
been banging the drum about the way 
the PRC has taken advantage of what 
makes our country’s economic system 
so great—our openness, our trans-
parency, our free markets. 
The Chinese Government, unfortu-
nately, plays by a different set of rules. 
The Chinese Government starts with 
the willingness to use all the tools of 
its intelligence services, sometimes its 
student population, which has added so 
much value to our country, and enor-
mous thefts of intellectual property. 
Some public estimates are north of $500 
billion a year. 
The Chinese Government, as well, is 
using all aspects of its society to in-
crease China’s dominance, from the in-
tellectual property theft that I talked 
about to opaque subsidies in financing 
that always favor a Chinese vendor. 
And, unfortunately, for many of our 
trading partners, the deal that is of-
fered by the Chinese firm is often ei-
ther too good or linked to another de-
velopment—‘‘I am going to build you a 
road; I am going to build you a port, 
but you have to buy at Huawei, as the 
price of that,’’ or because we in Amer-
ica or, for that matter, even in the 
West have not kept up on a financing 
basis. 
That is why in the Endless Frontier 
bill that we are debating right now, a 
bill that will make substantial invest-
ments in the National Science Founda-
tion and the Department of Energy, 
our National Labs—both great national 
assets—in this bill, as well, we are ac-
tually doing more than authorizing 
new ideas and new advancements. We 
are actually finally—finally—putting 
our money where our mouth is. 
It is why included in the Endless 
Frontier bill is the Utilizing Strategic 
Allied Telecommunications Act, which, 
at the end of the day, is basically $2 
billion to invest in making sure that in 
America we have, and in the West we 
have, a competitor against Huawei. 
I have come to this floor and talked 
a lot about the national security 
threat Huawei presents in America 
and, for that matter, to our allies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3189 
May 20, 2021 
But if you don’t have a competitor 
priced on a fair basis, what do you ex-
pect to do? What do you expect of an 
ally country to do? Or for that matter, 
what do you expect of many of the 
rural telecos’ decision, which was to 
buy Huawei equipment, until this vul-
nerability got exposed. 
On this bill I was proud to work with 
two of my great partners on the Intel-
ligence Committee, Senator RICHARD 
BURR and Senator MARCO RUBIO. 
What we do with this $2 billion is put 
up a public wireless supply chain inno-
vation fund to spur investments toward 
open architecture, innovative, leap- 
ahead technologies in our domestic 
mobile market. 
And what we are really talking about 
doing—and I know I have talked to the 
Presiding Officer about this and oth-
ers—is, in 5G, we are almost so far be-
hind at this point that we have to leap-
frog ahead. But one way we can leap-
frog ahead is by developing what is 
called open RAN, or open radio access 
network. What does that mean in 
English? Well, it means let’s move 
away from the traditional hardware- 
based stack of the telephone wireless 
system and move to a more software- 
based system. 
When we do that, we get away from 
the inherent advantages that the Chi-
nese and Huawei have, and we move to 
an area where there are a host of 
American and other enterprises that 
are software-based, where we are al-
ready far ahead. 
Now, what we also have to do, as 
well, is combine this investment—and 
we have close to $500 million on this— 
to also invest in a multilateral fund. 
The truth is, no single American 
company on its own can take on this 
enormous challenge that the whole 
Chinese state, backing their Chinese 
champion—there is no way we can take 
that on, on our own. So how do we 
think, with our other democratic allies 
around the world, the G7, but also 
countries like South Korea, Taiwan, 
Singapore and India, Israel, and others, 
that we can collaborate on this tech-
nology development? Think about how 
we compete on an economic basis and 
at the same time make sure that we in-
stall those values around transparency, 
respect for human rights, the notion of 
open and competitive system, that 
those are built into technology devel-
opment. 
The second item is crucially that this 
bill also addresses the essential need 
for us to invest in semiconductors. We 
are finally putting our money where 
our mouth is. This bill will appropriate 
on an emergency basis $52 billion for 
investment in chips in our country and 
along with our allies. 
This basically builds upon legislation 
that we added to the Defense author-
ization bill last year. It is bipartisan. 
Senator CORNYN, Senator SCHUMER, 
Senator COTTON, Senator KELLY are all 
working together on this with a host of 
others because the semiconductor in-
dustry, while we have seen some slid-
ing, still represents one of the shining 
lights of our country’s innovation 
economy. 
And as a wider array of products and 
services 
depend 
on 
internet 
connectivity and software processing, 
the demand for semiconductors has 
only grown. 
But as I outlined at the top, unfortu-
nately, that leadership position we 
have had for so long is at stake. So the 
CHIPS Act, which is built in now— 
baked into the Endless Frontier Act— 
directs and empowers key Agencies, 
like the Department of Commerce, in 
consultation with others like our intel-
ligence community, to make invest-
ments in microelectronics R&D a pri-
ority. It emphasizes the need for multi-
lateral efforts with our allies and close 
trading partners to bring greater trans-
parency and accountability to sub-
sidies. It aligns policies toward non- 
transparent, non-market competitors 
like the Chinese, and it makes sure 
that we have concerted and coordi-
nated action, both domestically and, 
again, with our allies, on supply chain 
security and integrity. 
It invests billions in basic research 
related to advanced semiconductors via 
DOD and a newly created National 
Semiconductor Technology Center, and 
it makes an unprecedented investment 
in trying to build new foundries, fabs, 
or basic manufacturing facilities, here 
in the United States so that we have 
that supply security chain—a secure 
supply chain for the future. 
That $39 billion in that fund I believe 
will help us build 7 to 10 new fabs right 
here in the United States. And whether 
they are in the Presiding Officer’s 
State or Virginia or elsewhere, our 
States will have to invest as well. 
Many of these facilities cost anywhere 
from $12 to $15 billion by the time you 
build them and keep them operating 
until they have some level of profit-
ability. So some level of American na-
tional investment in each of these is 
needed to make sure that they—at 
least some of these—will be built in the 
United States. And, again, the $39 bil-
lion should generate 7 to 10 new fabs 
over the next 5 to 7 years. 
And whether it is chips for auto-
motive, aerospace, biomedical, or cell 
phones—you name it—or the billions of 
‘‘internet of things’’ devices, almost all 
rely upon semiconductors. Let’s make 
sure those chips are built, designed, 
and produced here, and that those else-
where in the world are often done in 
countries that are allies. 
So the Endless Frontier Act, which 
includes both the investment in 5G and 
ORAN and, obviously, the semiconduc-
tors, serves as a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to solidify U.S. leadership 
in science and tech innovation. It will 
strengthen our national security and 
reinvigorate American ingenuity. 
The truth is, colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, I know we are supportive 
of these efforts. I hope next week that 
we pass this bill with a massive major-
ity, and that then it will be quickly 
acted upon by the House, because I 
know 
our 
domestic 
industries 
are 
watching us. I know our adversaries 
are, as well, and it will be wonderful if 
we can finally move beyond simply 
talking about the challenges that

REMEMBERING WALTER MONDALE 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the late 
Walter Mondale is widely known for 
having transformed the role of Vice 
President, ably taking on many key re-
sponsibilities that were delegated to 
him by President Jimmy Carter. Less 
noted are his many accomplishments 
in this body while he served as a Sen-
ator from the State of Minnesota. 
Walter Mondale is sometimes de-
scribed as the paradigm figure of the 
transition between two eras—the FDR 
Coalition up to the war in Vietnam and 
the social ferment that came after the 
war. And perhaps this is so, but to me, 
who Fritz Mondale was and what he 
stood for are just as important as when 
he stood there. The issues he led on 
then are as fresh as today’s news and as 
enduring as our founding documents, 
issues like the concentration and abuse 
of power or social and economic justice 
and the consolidation of wealth in the 
pockets and portfolios of just a few or 
the role of government in protecting 
the little guy when powerful market 
forces run roughshod or the tension be-
tween freedom and security; even the 
question of whether a woman ever 
could credibly assume the highest of-
fice in the land. Trace any of these 
issues back in time, and you will find 
Fritz 
Mondale 
at 
earlier 
decision 
points. 
Fritz Mondale was a good man whose 
decency elevated every institution in 
which he served. Who he was has every-
thing to do with what he achieved. He 
loved the Senate, and the Senate loved 
him back. He said the Senate ‘‘was like 
mainlining human nature.’’ 
One side of Fritz that the public did 
not see as readily as we did in the Sen-
ate was his sense of humor—one of the

best I have ever known. In many a 
tense moment, his sense of humor 
often defused the tension and restored 
the spirit of comity that is so crucial 
in getting things done in the Senate. 
He knew the art of being able to dis-
agree without being disagreeable. I 
wish the American people had seen 
more of that side of Fritz Mondale. 
That was a heady and vibrant legisla-
tive era, and Fritz had a hand in vir-
tually every major piece of civil rights, 
education, and childcare legislation 
that emerged from Congress during 
that period. 
Another of Fritz Mondale’s most re-
markable and lasting achievements in 
the Senate was to engineer a change in 
the Senate’s rules, to curb the abuse of 
filibusters in thwarting the will of 
clear majorities of the American peo-
ple. The difficulty in passing the civil 
rights laws of the sixties had gradually 
convinced more and more Senators 
that the bar for cutting off debate in 
the Senate was set too high. 
That might not sound difficult, but 
changing the way the Senate operates 
is something akin to trying to change 
the weather. 
As a freshman Senator, I had a front 
seat and a bit part in Fritz’s highly or-
ganized campaign to change the clo-
ture rule. He won the change in the 
cloture rule, and it is not an exaggera-
tion to point out that his efforts prob-
ably saved the Senate as we know it, 
and he did it without changing the 
Senate’s fundamental character. 
The Senate at its best can be the con-
science of the Nation. It takes constant 
work and vigilance to keep our system 
working as it should for the better-
ment of our society and its people. 
Keeping faith with these fundamentals 
accounts for much of the legacy of 
Fritz Mondale. 
It is easy for politicians to appeal to 
our worst instincts and to our selfish-
ness. Political leaders serve best when 
they appeal to the best in us, to lift our 
sights, summon our will and raise us to 
a higher level. 
Fritz Mondale’s farewell message to 
his staff made clear that this is how he 
thought of himself to the end of his 
days: as a public servant. He rep-
resented the best of what public service 
means. 
Through his own public service Fritz 
Mondale invested himself in the belief 
that our democracy gives each of us 
the opportunity to thrive, to make jus-
tice real, and to make the economy 
work for all and not just for some. 
His legacy in the Senate deserves to 
be and will be an enduring one.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LOGAN SCHONART 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to honor a Grand Forks firefighter for 
receiving a national honor by the VFW. 
Saving lives is what firefighters are 
called on to do as part of their job 
every day. But in the case of Logan 
Schonart, his lifesaving act went much 
beyond that. 
When members of the Grand Forks 
Fire Department heard Rick Aamot, 
their former batallion chief, was suf-
fering from kidney disease and needed 
a new kidney, they were concerned 
enough to look into how they could 
help. Because it can take years to find 
a donor, they joined in the search to 
find one. Schonart was among those 
who took a test for compatibility, and 
his test showed he was a match. Having 
worked together for nearly a decade be-
fore Aamot retired, Schonert thought 
enough of him to step forward and offer 
to be his donor. 
Schonert was not looking for pub-
licity about his successful kidney dona-
tion to Aamot, but he spoke out about 
it to encourage others to consider 
doing the same if the opportunity pre-
sented itself. In recognition of his gen-
erous lifesaving act, Schonart was 
named the 2020 North Dakota VFW 
Firefighter of the Year and earlier this 
month was named the 2021 National 
VFW Firefighter of the Year. The 
award was presented May 7 at the 
Grand Forks Fire Station. 
Mr. President, I congratulate Logan 
Schonart on this national honor recog-
nizing a firefighter who exceeds profes-
sional expectations and demonstrates 
community service and professional 
achievement. As the 2021 National 
VFW Firefighter of the Year, he sets an 
extraordinary example for all of us 
demonstrating what selfless sacrifice 
looks like.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO A. ED MAIRERLE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President. Today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
A. Ed Maierle of Cascade County as 
Montanan of the Month for his service 
to our country during World War II. Ed 
is also celebrating his 100th birthday 
on June 6, 2021, which is the 77th anni-
versary of the D-Day invasion in 
France. 
Ed enlisted in the U.S. Navy after 
Pearl Harbor was bombed. He was sent 
to Hawaii and became an ‘‘Avenger,’’ a 
member of a torpedo bomber squadron 
stationed at Pearl Harbor. Ed also 
manned a 50-caliber machine gun on a 
PBY, a WWII seaplane. He later was 
stationed for 2 years as propeller spe-
cialist 
with 
a 
B–24 
squadron 
on 
Esperitu Santo New Heberde Island. As 
part of this squadron, he flew daily 
missions, scouting for the dreaded A6M 
Zero Japanese fighter planes. 
After the war, Ed was stationed for 1 
year at Whidbey Island, WA, before re-
turning to Montana. For two summers, 
Ed and his wife, Mary Alice, became 
the first couple in the United States to 
man a U.S. Forest Service fire watch 
lookout tower. Following this adven-
ture, Ed embarked on a very successful 
career in the insurance business. He 
and Mary Alice were very active in 
community service. They both shared a 
strong faith in the Lord and were rec-
ognized for their 24 years of service in 
the Helena area nursing home min-
istry. 
Ed epitomizes the heart of a vet-
eran—a Montana hero—whose selfless 
service must not be forgotten. On be-
half of a grateful nation, I want to 
thank Ed for his service to our coun-
try, and I wish you a very happy birth-
day celebration with your family.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ADAM HAMMILL 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Adam Hammill and 
his business, Exile Burrito of Berlin, 
NH. Mr. Hammill, a Coast Guard vet-
eran, had the courage to open his busi-
ness after years of planning in May 2020 
amid the COVID–19 pandemic. 
After honorably serving our country, 
both in the Coast Guard and with the 
Bureau of Prisons, Mr. Hammill turned 
his passion for cooking authentic Mexi-
can cuisine into a family business and 
contributed to the revitalization of 
Berlin’s historic Main Street commu-
nity by opening a restaurant, creating 
jobs, and offering a new variety of 
table fare that was previously not 
available within an hour of New Hamp-
shire’s northernmost city. 
Opening a new business is always a 
challenge, but that is especially true 
for people like Mr. Hammill, who de-
cided to start their business during an 
unprecedented global pandemic. Mr. 
Hammill was committed to staying 
open for his employees and his commu-
nity by pivoting to a takeout model 
and implementing safety measures for 
both his employees and customers. As 
Mr. Hammill adapted to the ever 
changing business climate due to the 
pandemic, he found that as a new busi-
ness, he was unable to access the crit-
ical pandemic relief funding passed by 
Congress. Mr. Hammill recognized the 
gap in support and raised this issue 
with me. As a result of advocacy from 
Mr. Hammill and other new business 
owners in New Hampshire, I introduced 
the bipartisan Recovery Startup As-
sistance Act with Republican Senator 
MIKE BRAUN of Indiana, which Presi-
dent Biden signed into law as part of 
the 
American 
Rescue 
Plan. 
Now, 
thanks to Mr. Hammill’s advocacy, 
new business owners will be able to ac-
cess payroll assistance through a tai-
lored version of the employee retention 
tax credit. 
Mr. Hammill truly represents the 
best of the Granite State—serving our 
country, showing his grit and deter-
mination to open a successful business 
despite unprecedented challenges, and 
speaking up to help other new busi-
nesses like his own. I look forward to 
seeing what he accomplishes next.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. CORNYN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
YOUNG, and Mr. GRAHAM): 
S. 1724. A bill to amend the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act of 1938 to pro-
vide the Attorney General with greater 
authority to promote enforcement of 
disclosure requirements for agents of 
foreign principals, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act is a 
law that I have spoken about on this 
floor many times. At its core, the For-
eign Agents Registration Act brings 
transparency and accountability to for-
eign influences in our politics. 
I want to make very clear, this act 
doesn’t prohibit anybody from doing 
anything they want to do. It only re-
quires those who lobby on behalf of for-
eign governments and their interests 
to register their affiliations and activi-
ties with the Justice Department. This 
fits in with a law that I tried to surely 
describe as bringing transparency, and 
when you bring transparency, you have 
accountability. 
While it requires lobbyists on K 
Street to disclose if they are lobbying 
on behalf of foreign governments and 
their interests, it lacks the teeth nec-
essary to enforce the intent of the law 
and its other requirements. That is 
very much a weakness in a law that 
goes back to the 1930s, and it hasn’t 
been updated in the last 55 years. 
Today, I seek to change, once again, 
that environment I just told you about 
by introducing the Foreign Agents Dis-
closure and Registration Enhancement 
Act. If enacted, this legislation would 
grant the Justice Department new in-
vestigative powers. 
The bill would increase criminal and 
civil penalties for violations. It does 
this in order to deter abuse of the law; 
in other words, people not registering 
when they should register. 
The bill appropriately limits who in 
the Justice Department can use this 
authority, and it provides essential due 
process protections. In fact, it is based 
on identical authorities in the False 
Claims Act, which for years has helped 
root out waste, fraud, and abuse. 
The bill tasks the Government Ac-
countability 
Office 
with 
studying 
whether and to what extent the Lob-
bying Disclosure Act exemption to the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act is 
being abused. 
These reforms are the result of this 
Senator’s oversight and policy work 
dating to 2015. These reforms are not in 
any way partisan, and last Congress 
this was very much a bipartisan bill. 
This Congress, it seems funny that 
not a single Democratic colleague 
would join me and my Republican col-
leagues in cosponsoring this legisla-
tion, even though the same people co-
sponsored it in the last Congress. I 
have to ask my Democratic colleagues: 
What is different now than at the tail 
end of the last Congress? 
In December of last year, I came to 
the floor for a live unanimous consent 
on this very same bill. At that time, I 
had the support of the chairs and sen-
ior Democratic Senators on both the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and the 
Senate Intelligence Committee. What 
has changed between last December 
and right now, that these same Demo-
crats who helped us aren’t helping us 
on a bill that is the same? Are the com-
promises that we hashed out no longer 
relevant now that the Democrats con-
trol the U.S. Senate and, of course, the 
Presidency? 
Maybe I should put it a little more 
bluntly. Do my Democratic colleagues 
no longer care, now that the Trump ad-
ministration isn’t in power? During the 
Trump administration, I heard my 
Democratic colleagues speak loudly 
about the risks of foreign influence on 
the Trump administration. We all 
heard it: Trump, Russia. We heard it 
all day, every day. 
Well, I can ask embarrassing things 
on the other side. What about Biden 
and China? We all know about the 
links between the Biden family and 
Chinese foreign nationals connected to 
the communist regime, and those links 
are real and proven, unlike the links 
that supposedly existed between Trump 
and Russia that a whole 2 years of 
study proved were not true. 
If the Democrats want to be intellec-
tually honest on the issue of foreign in-
fluence, they are going to have to face 
the music on both sides of the political 
spectrum. 
I have conducted oversight of the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act with-
out regard to power, party, or privi-
lege. That means I have done it both 
when we had Democratic Presidents 
and when we had Republican Presi-
dents. 
Also, I raised concerns about the 
work for Ukrainians by Paul Manafort 
and the Podesta Group, also involved 
with the Foreign Agents Registration 
Act—or maybe they should have been 
involved with it—and violated it. 
I even raised concerns when the firm 
behind the discredited Steele dossier 
failed to register for its lobbying work 
to repeal U.S. sanctions against Rus-
sia. 
I subpoenaed Paul Manafort to tes-
tify at the Judiciary Committee hear-
ing on lax Foreign Agent Registration 
Act enforcement. 
I praised Mueller for dusting off the 
law that had been ignored for so long. 
I want to remind my colleagues that 
we make laws to be equally enforced, 
no matter which party is in power. The 
Foreign Agents Registration Act isn’t 
a right or left issue. It is about foreign 
influence, about foreign control, and 
the preservation of our sovereignty. 
Without our sovereignty, we fail to 
even exist as a nation. 
The last Congress—getting back at 
my attempt to make a unanimous con-
sent request—at that time, Senator 
MENENDEZ did what he had the author-
ity to do and the right to do. He ob-
jected at that particular time, stating 
that it bothered him because the For-
eign Agents Registration Act reform 
should move through regular order be-
cause that committee, under Repub-
lican leadership at that time, did not 
take up the bill. 
The chairman then gave his approval 
to it but obviously didn’t get MENEN-
DEZ’s 
approval 
to 
it. 
So 
Senator 
MENENDEZ did what he thought a rank-
ing member of the committee ought to 
do to protect his side of the aisle, and 
he objected. He wanted it to go through 
regular reform. So I am waiting for 
regular reform to happen. 
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator MENENDEZ and the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee to move this bill any 
way they want to move it, through reg-
ular order or, like we did last time, by 
having 
the 
chairman 
and 
ranking 
member just approve moving it. In 
fact, some of your Members were pre-
vious cosponsors of this bill. 
So I am saying to Senator MENENDEZ 
that members of his committee cospon-
sored this bill last time, and I don’t un-
derstand why they aren’t joining me in 
cosponsoring it this time. I would love 
to have them do that. 
The issues with foreign influence on 
our political system aren’t going to go 
away. In fact, I think we can say they 
are primed to get even worse. In the 
meantime, while partisan politics play 
out, the Foreign Agents Registration 
Act stands without necessary reform. 
I strongly urge my Democratic col-
leagues to work with me and my Re-
publican cosponsors to achieve a much 
needed, meaningful reform to a very 
important law that doesn’t deprive 
anybody from making their living any 
way they want to. If they want to 
lobby and influence our government for 
a foreign country, we accept that. They 
can work in that if they want to, but 
we ought to know about it. That is 
what the Foreign Agents Registration 
Act is all about, to get this informa-
tion out so it can be made public be-
cause, with transparency, there is ac-
countability.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3197 
May 20, 2021 
S. 1747 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fluke Fair-
ness Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Summer flounder is an important eco-
nomic fish stock for commercial and rec-
reational fishermen across the Northeast and 
Mid-Atlantic United States. 
(2) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Con-
servation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 
1801 et seq.) was reauthorized in 2006 and in-
stituted annual catch limits and account-
ability measures for important fish stocks. 
(3) That reauthorization prompted fishery 
managers to look at alternate management 
schemes to rebuild depleted stocks like sum-
mer flounder. 
(4) Summer flounder occur in both State 
and Federal waters and are managed through 
a joint fishery management plan between the 
Council and the Commission. 
(5) The Council and the Commission de-
cided that each State’s recreational and 
commercial harvest limits for summer floun-
der would be based upon landings in previous 
years. 
(6) These historical landings were based on 
flawed data sets that no longer provide fair-
ness or flexibility for fisheries managers to 
allocate resources based on the best science. 
(7) This allocation mechanism resulted in 
an uneven split among the States along the 
East Coast which is problematic. 
(8) The fishery management plan for sum-
mer flounder does not account for regional 
changes in the location of the fluke stock 
even though the stock has moved further to 
the north and changes in effort by anglers 
along the East Coast. 
(9) The States have been locked in a man-
agement system based on data collected 
from 1981 to 1989, thus, the summer flounder 
stock is not being managed using the best 
available science and modern fishery man-
agement techniques. 
(10) It is in the interest of the Federal Gov-
ernment to establish a new fishery manage-
ment plan for summer flounder that is based 
on current geographic, scientific, and eco-
nomic realities. 
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) COMMISSION.—The term ‘‘Commission’’ 
means the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries 
Commission. 
(2) COUNCIL.—The term ‘‘Council’’ means

Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)). 
(3) NATIONAL STANDARDS.—The term ‘‘Na-
tional Standards’’ means the national stand-
ards for fishery conservation and manage-
ment set out in section 301(a) of the Magnu-
son-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Man-
agement Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)). 
(4) 
SECRETARY.—The

(a) FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN MODIFICA-
TION.—Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Council shall sub-
mit to the Secretary, and the Secretary may 
approve, a modified fishery management 
plan for the commercial management of 
summer flounder under title III of the Mag-
nuson-Stevens 
Fishery 
Conservation 
and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) or an 
amendment to such plan that— 
(1) shall be based on the best scientific in-
formation available; 
(2) establishes commercial quotas in direct 
proportion to the distribution, abundance, 
and location of summer flounder as reflected 
by fishery independent surveys conducted by 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and 
State agencies; 
(3) considers regional, coastwide, or other 
management measures for summer flounder 
that comply with the National Standards; 
and 
(4) prohibits the establishment of commer-
cial catch quotas for summer flounder on a 
State-by-State basis using historical land-
ings data that does not reflect the status of 
the summer flounder stock, based on the 
most recent scientific information. 
(b) CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSION.— 
In preparing the modified fishery manage-
ment plan or an amendment to such a plan 
as described in subsection (a), the Council 
shall consult with the Commission to ensure 
consistent 
management 
throughout 
the 
range of the summer flounder. 
(c) FAILURE TO SUBMIT PLAN.—If the Coun-
cil fails to submit a modified fishery man-
agement plan or an amendment to such a 
plan as described in subsection (a) that may 
be approved by the Secretary, the Secretary 
shall prepare and consider such a modified 
plan or amendment. 
SEC. 5. REPORT. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
approval under section 4 of a modified fish-
ery management plan for the commercial 
management of summer flounder or an 
amendment to such plan, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall submit to 
Congress a report on the implementation of 
such modified plan or amendment that in-
cludes an assessment of whether such imple-
mentation 
complies 
with 
the 
National 
Standards. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 1769. A bill to adjust the boundary 
of the Santa Monica Mountains Na-
tional Recreation Area to include the 
Rim of the Valley Corridor, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to reintroduce the ‘‘Rim of 
the Valley Corridor Preservation Act’’ 
along with my California colleague 
Senator PADILLA. 
This legislation, based on a Congres-
sionally-authorized 
National 
Park 
Service study, would increase the size 
of the Santa Monica Recreation Area 
by 191,000 acres, accomplishing mul-
tiple goals of expanding access to green 
space for underserved communities and 
conserving 
and 
connecting 
wildlife 
habitat corridors, while maintaining 
private property rights and existing 
land-use authorities. 
In 2008, Congress passed the Rim of 
the Valley Corridor Study Act, which 
directed the National Park Service to 
study the area. The park expansion in 
our bill is based upon this six-year spe-
cial resource study. 
This bill also takes into account 
more than 2,000 comments received by 
the public, elected officials, local orga-
nizations, and other stakeholders. 
The ‘‘Rim of the Valley Corridor 
Preservation Act’’ would add 191,000 
acres to the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation area. This addi-
tion, known as the Rim of the Valley 
Unit, would provide improved rec-
reational, educational, and outdoor op-
portunities to the local communities. 
The proposed expansion would also 
better protect natural resources and 
habitats, including valuable habitat for 
endangered wildlife, such as the Cali-
fornia red-legged frog, mountain lions, 
bobcats, foxes, badgers, coyotes, and 
deer. 
Notably, the ‘‘Rim of the Valley Cor-
ridor Preservation Act’’ would only 
allow the Department of the Interior to 
acquire non-Federal land within the 
new boundaries through exchange, do-
nation, or purchase from willing sell-
ers. 
As I mentioned, this legislation will 
significantly 
expand 
outdoor 
rec-
reational opportunities for residents of 
Los Angeles County, one of the most 
densely populated and park-poor areas 
in 
California. 
The 
impact 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic has only under-
scored the importance of having access 
to green spaces close to home. 
In fact, 47% of Californians—that’s 
six percent of the total U.S. popu-
lation—live within two hours of the 
proposed expansion area. Enlarging the 
Santa 
Monica 
Mountains 
National 
Recreation Area, at no cost to U.S. 
taxpayers, will provide these commu-
nities with increased access to public 
lands and boost the local economy. 
In light of President Biden’s January 
27, 2021 Executive Order on ‘‘Tackling 
the 
Climate 
Crisis 
at 
Home 
and 
Abroad’’ setting the goal of protecting 
‘‘30 percent of our lands and waters by 
2030’’, this legislation aligns with that 
goal and provides an opportunity to ad-
vance it based on federal agency rec-
ommendation and a robust public proc-
ess. 
Last Congress, we successfully ad-
vanced this legislation out of the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
in the Senate. 
My colleague, Representative ADAM 
SCHIFF, reintroduced this legislation in 
the House, where it passed as part of a 
larger package in a bipartisan vote last 
February. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass the ‘‘Rim of the Val-
ley Corridor Preservation Act’’ out of 
the Senate as well. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

Continental Baking Company in 1925, and 
subsequently combined the standardized 1.5 
pound 
loaves 
with 
the 
Otto 
Frederick 
Rohwedder invention for slicing newly baked 
bread in the factory and the Henri Sevigne 
machine that wrapped the loaves in waxed 
paper to ensure freshness, expanding the 
Wonder Bread identity, deliverability, and 
storage capability; 
Whereas Wonder Bread’s popularity great-
ly expanded after World War II, leading to a 
Government request to enhance Wonder 
Bread with vitamins and minerals to enable 
the company to advertise its nutritional 
qualities as well as its convenience; 
Whereas Wonder Bread became a major 
sponsor of renowned children’s television 
shows, and as a result, children from across 
the country embraced the bread even more; 
Whereas the creation and rising popularity 
of Wonder Bread coincided with a new indus-
trial era where factories produced food with 
uniform size and weight, and its pre-sliced 
convenience and being wrapped in resealable 
packaging made Wonder Bread an icon in the 
United States; and 
Whereas Wonder Bread was not associated 
with a particular ethnic group, religion, or 
region of the country and was something 
new that all people of the United States were 
experiencing together as something that 
symbolized the collective experience of the 
post-war United States and all its possibili-
ties: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) while the Wonder Bread brand has been 
purchased by multiple companies in the last 
century, it will always be associated with In-
dianapolis, 
Indiana, 
where 
the 
Taggart 
brothers first developed it; 
(2) the influence of the production, pack-
aging, and advertising of Wonder Bread set a 
standard for an entire industry; 
(3) Wonder Bread’s story of being created 
by immigrants, combining with other inno-
vations to create something entirely new, 
and embracing new means of advertising and 
distribution all combined to make the story 
of Wonder Bread unique to the United 
States; 
(4) Wonder Bread, and its immediate asso-
ciation with childhood, is a touchstone for 
all people of the United States, a product 
that is iconic to our culture, and a symbol of 
the age in which it was developed; and 
(5) the 100th anniversary of the launching 
of Wonder Bread is a moment to celebrate 
United States heritage and the innovation of 
the people of the United States.

Mr.

tion; which was considered and agreed

S. RES. 228 
Whereas the 11th annual Kids to Parks Day

Whereas the goals of Kids to Parks Day are 
to— 
(1) promote healthy outdoor recreation and 
responsible environmental stewardship; 
(2) empower young people; and 
(3) encourage families to get outdoors and 
visit the parks and public land of the United 
States; 
Whereas, on Kids to Parks Day, individuals 
from rural, suburban, and urban areas of the 
United States can be reintroduced to the 
splendid National, State, and neighborhood 
parks located in their communities; 
Whereas communities across the United 
States offer a variety of natural resources 
and public land, often with free access, to in-
dividuals seeking outdoor recreation; 
Whereas the people of the United States, 
young and old, should be encouraged to lead 
more healthy and active lifestyles; 
Whereas Kids to Parks Day is an oppor-
tunity for families to take a break from 
their busy lives and enjoy a day of active, 
wholesome fun; and 
Whereas Kids to Parks Day will— 
(1) broaden an appreciation for nature and 
the outdoors in young people; 
(2) foster a safe setting for independent 
play and healthy adventure in neighborhood 
parks; and 
(3) facilitate self-reliance while strength-
ening communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 15, 2021, as ‘‘Kids to 
Parks Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the importance of outdoor 
recreation and the preservation of open 
spaces for the health and education of the 
young people of the United States; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Kids to Parks Day with 
safe family trips to parks.

amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr.

a new Directorate for Technology and 
Innovation in the National Science 
Foundation, to establish a regional 
technology hub program, to require a 
strategy and report on economic secu-
rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
TITLE ll—REINS ACT 
SEC. ll01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Regulations 
from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act 
of 2021’’ or the ‘‘REINS Act’’ 
SEC. ll02. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this title is to increase ac-
countability for and transparency in the 
Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of arti-
cle I of the United States Constitution 
grants all legislative powers to Congress. 
Over time, Congress has excessively dele-
gated its constitutional charge while failing 
to conduct appropriate oversight and retain 
accountability for the content of the laws it 
passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the 
REINS Act will result in more carefully 
drafted and detailed legislation, an improved 
regulatory process, and a legislative branch 
that is truly accountable to the American 
people for the laws imposed upon them. 
SEC. ll03. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGEN-
CY RULEMAKING.

amended to read as follows:

er of that House (or his or her respective des-
ignee) shall introduce (by request, if appro-
priate) a joint resolution described in para-

sion days.

at any stage of proceeding. 
‘‘(b) A joint resolution described in sub-

tion over the provision of law under which 
the rule is issued. 
‘‘(c) In the Senate, if the committee or 
committees to which a joint resolution de-
scribed in subsection (a) has been referred 
have not reported it at the end of 15 session 
days after its introduction, such committee 
or committees shall be automatically dis-
charged from further consideration of the 
resolution and it shall be placed on the cal-
endar. A vote on final passage of the resolu-
tion shall be taken on or before the close of 
the 15th session day after the resolution is 
reported by the committee or committees to 
which it was referred, or after such com-
mittee or committees have been discharged 
from further consideration of the resolution. 
‘‘(d)(1) In the Senate, when the committee 
or committees to which a joint resolution is 
referred have reported, or when a committee 
or committees are discharged (under sub-
section (c)) from further consideration of a 
joint resolution described in subsection (a), 
it is at any time thereafter in order (even 
though a previous motion to the same effect 
has been disagreed to) for a motion to pro-
ceed to the consideration of the joint resolu-
tion, and all points of order against the joint 
resolution (and against consideration of the 
joint resolution) are waived. The motion is 
not subject to amendment, or to a motion to 
postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of other business. A motion to 
reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in

ation of the joint resolution is agreed to, the 
joint resolution shall remain the unfinished 
business of the Senate until disposed of.

olution, and on all debatable motions and ap-
peals in connection therewith, shall be lim-
ited to not more than 2 hours, which shall be 
divided equally between those favoring and 
those opposing the joint resolution. A mo-
tion to further limit debate is in order and 
not debatable. An amendment to, or a mo-
tion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to 
the consideration of other business, or a mo-
tion to recommit the joint resolution is not 
in order. 
‘‘(3) In the Senate, immediately following 
the conclusion of the debate on a joint reso-
lution described in subsection (a), and a sin-
gle quorum call at the conclusion of the de-
bate if requested in accordance with the

ther consideration of the joint resolution,

batable for 1 hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the proponent and an opponent,

shall be the same as if no joint resolution 
had been received from the other House until

plant the joint resolution of the receiving 
House.

ENSURING RELIABLE SUPPLY OF

(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(A) The People’s Republic of China is the 
global leader in mining, refining, and compo-
nent manufacturing of rare earth elements, 
producing approximately 85 percent of the 
world’s supply between 2011 and 2017. 
(B) In 2019, the United States imported an 
estimated 80 percent of its rare earth com-
pounds from the People’s Republic of China. 
(C) On March 26, 2014, the World Trade Or-
ganization ruled that the People’s Republic 
of China’s export restraints on rare earth 
minerals violated its obligations under its 
protocol of accession to the World Trade Or-
ganization, thereby harming United States 
manufacturers and workers. 
(D) The Chinese Communist Party has 
threatened to leverage the People’s Republic 
of China’s dominant position in the rare 
earth market to ‘‘strike back’’ at the United 
States. 
(E) The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is 
an effective partnership for reliable multi-
lateral financing, development, and distribu-
tion of goods for global consumption, as evi-
denced by the Quad Vaccine Partnership an-
nounced on March 12, 2021. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) the People’s Republic of China’s domi-
nant share of the global rare earth mining 
market is a threat to the economic stability, 
well being, and competitiveness of key in-
dustries in the United States; 
(B) the United States should reduce reli-
ance on the People’s Republic of China for 
rare earth minerals through— 
(i) strategic investments in development 
projects, production technologies, and refin-
ing facilities in the United States; or 
(ii) in partnership with strategic allies of 
the United States that are reliable trading 
partners, including members of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue; and 
(C) the United States Trade Representative 
should initiate multilateral talks among the 
countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dia-
logue to promote shared investment and de-
velopment of rare earth minerals. 
(b) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the United States Trade Representative, in 
consultation with the officials specified in 
paragraph (3), shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a report on 
the work of the Trade Representative to ad-
dress the national security threat posed by 
the People’s Republic of China’s control of 
nearly 2⁄3 of the global supply of rare earth 
minerals. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a description of the extent of the en-
gagement of the United States with the 
other countries of the Quadrilateral Security 
Dialogue to promote shared investment and 
development of rare earth minerals during 
the period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of this Act and ending on the date 
of the report; and 
(B) a description of the plans of the Presi-

Mr. TUBERVILLE sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed by him to the bill S. 1260, to 
establish a new Directorate for Tech-
nology and Innovation in the National 
Science Foundation, to establish a re-
gional technology hub program, to re-
quire a strategy and report on eco-

FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Thrift Savings Fund invests more 
than $700,000,000,000 on behalf of plan partici-
pants. As the guardian of the retirement 
funds of approximately 6,000,000 Federal ci-
vilian and military plan participants, it is 
critical that sums in the Thrift Savings 
Fund are not invested in securities linked to 
the economy of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
(2) Companies headquartered in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China have repeatedly com-
mitted corporate espionage, violated sanc-
tions imposed by the United States, flouted 
international 
property 
laws, 
committed 
theft, and failed to comply with audit and 
regulatory standards designed to safeguard 
investors. 
(3) The Thrift Savings Plan is known for 
its low management fees and comprehensive 
array of investment strategies. The provi-
sions of this section, and the amendments 
made by this section, will not increase fees 
imposed on participants of the Thrift Sav-
ings Plan. 
(4) The November 2017 selection of the 
MSCI ACWI Index by the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board, initially scheduled 
to be effective in 2020, would violate the 
terms of subsection (i) of section 8438 of title 
5, United States Code, as added by subsection 
(b)(1) of this section. 
(b) PROHIBITION ON ANY TSP FUND INVEST-
ING IN ENTITIES ORGANIZED OR ESTABLISHED 
IN THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Section 8438 of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(i) Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this section, no fund established or over-
seen by the Board may include an invest-
ment in any security of— 
‘‘(1) an entity organized or established in 
the People’s Republic of China; or 
‘‘(2) any subsidiary that is owned or oper-
ated by an entity described in paragraph 
(1).’’. 
(2) DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS.—Not later than 
180 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Federal Retirement Thrift Invest-
ment Board established under section 8472(a) 
of title 5, United States Code, shall— 
(A) review whether any sums in the Thrift 
Savings Fund are invested in violation of 
subsection (i) of section 8438 of that title, as 
added by paragraph (1) of this subsection; 
(B) if any sums are invested in the manner 
described in subparagraph (A), divest those 
sums in a manner that is consistent with the 
legal and fiduciary duties provided under 
chapter 84 of that title, or any other applica-
ble provision of law; and 
(C) reinvest any sums divested under sub-
paragraph (B) in investments that do not 
violate subsection (i) of section 8438 of that 
title, as added by paragraph (1) of this sub-
section. 
(c) PROHIBITION
ON
INVESTMENT
OF
TSP 
FUNDS
IN
ENTITIES
ORGANIZED
OR
ESTAB-
LISHED IN THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
THROUGH THE TSP MUTUAL FUND WINDOW.— 
Section 8438(b)(5) of title 5, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(E) A mutual fund accessible through a 
mutual fund window authorized under this 
paragraph may not include an investment in 
any security of— 
‘‘(i) an entity organized or established in 
the People’s Republic of China; or 
‘‘(ii) any subsidiary that is owned or oper-
ated by an entity described in clause (i).’’. 
SA 1781. Mr. LEE submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. 
SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish 
a new Directorate for Technology and 
Innovation in the National Science 
Foundation, to establish a regional 
technology hub program, to require a 
strategy and report on economic secu-
rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing:

tion (Public Law 93–148; 50 U.S.C. 1541 et

Zealand Agreement, the Republic of Korea 
Treaty, or the Southeast Asia Treaty, the 
President may not introduce members of the

(1) such action is necessary, for a period of 
no longer than 30 days, to repel a sudden at-
tack, or the concrete, specific, and imme-
diate threat of such a sudden attack, upon 
the United States, its territories, or posses-
sions, its armed forces, or other United 
States citizens overseas; or 
(1) Congress has enacted an authorization 
for the use of military force. 
SA 1782. Mr. CARDIN submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. 
SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish 
a new Directorate for Technology and

SEC. 7002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) During times of economic downturn or 
recession, communities of color, and busi-
nesses within those communities, are gen-
erally more adversely affected, which re-
quires an expansion of the ability of the Fed-
eral Government to infuse resources into 
those communities. 
(2) Despite the growth in the number of mi-
nority business enterprises, gaps remain 
with respect to key metrics for those enter-
prises, such as access to capital, revenue, 
number of employees, and survival rate. Spe-
cifically— 
(A) according to the Department of Com-
merce, minority business enterprises are 2 to 
3 times more likely to be denied loans than 
non-minority business enterprises; 
(B) according to the Bureau of the Census, 
the average non-minority business enterprise 
reports receipts that are more than 3 times 
higher than receipts reported by the average 
minority business enterprise; and 
(C) according to the Kauffman Founda-
tion— 
(i) minority business enterprises are 1⁄2 as 
likely to employ individuals, as compared 
with non-minority business enterprises; and 
(ii) if minorities started and owned busi-
nesses at the same rate as non-minorities, 
the United States economy would have more 
than 1,000,000 additional employer businesses 
and more than 9,500,000 additional jobs. 
(3) Because of the conditions described in 
paragraph (2), it is in the interest of the 
United States and the economy of the United 
States to expeditiously ameliorate the dis-
parities that minority business enterprises 
experience. 
(4) Many individuals who own minority 
business enterprises are socially disadvan-
taged because those individuals identify as 
members of certain groups that have suffered 
the effects of discriminatory practices or 
similar circumstances over which those indi-
viduals have no control, including individ-
uals who are— 
(A) Black or African American; 
(B) Hispanic or Latino; 
(C) American Indian or Alaska Native; 
(D) Asian; and 
(E) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Is-
lander. 
(5) Discriminatory practices and similar 
circumstances described in paragraph (4) are 
a significant determinant of overall eco-
nomic disadvantage in the United States, 
which is evident in the persistent racial 
wealth gap in the United States. 
(6) While other Federal agencies focus only 
on small businesses and businesses that rep-
resent a broader demographic than solely 
minority business enterprises, the Agency 
focuses exclusively on— 
(A) the unique needs of minority business 
enterprises; and 
(B) enhancing the capacity of minority 
business enterprises. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this divi-
sion are to— 
(1) require the Agency to promote and ad-
minister programs in the public and private 
sectors to assist the development of minor-
ity business enterprises; and 
(2) achieve the development described in 
paragraph (1) by authorizing the Assistant 
Secretary to carry out programs that will re-
sult in increased access to capital, manage-
ment, and technology for minority business 
enterprises.

PROPERTY 
PROVISIONS 
OF 
ECO-
NOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT BE-
TWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Agreement includes significant 
mandates for the People’s Republic of China 
related to its domestic intellectual property 
regime, including with respect to copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; 
(2) the changes included in the Agreement, 
if implemented effectively, should improve 
the domestic intellectual property frame-
work of the People’s Republic of China, 
which has historically proven to harm the 
innovation and creative communities in the 
United States; 
(3) despite commitments made by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
under the Agreement, ongoing market access 
barriers, uneven enforcement, measures re-
quiring forced technology transfer, and seri-
ous deficiencies in the rule of law continue 
to make the business environment in the 
People’s Republic of China highly chal-
lenging for rights holders in the United 
States; 
(4) as reflected in the 2021 report by the 
United States Trade Representative required 
under section 182(h) of the Trade Act of 1974 
(19 U.S.C. 2242(h)) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Special 301 Report’’), the People’s Re-
public of China has consistently been listed 
in that annual report since 1989 as a trading 
partner of the United States that ‘‘fails to 
provide adequate and effective IP protection 
and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, 
brands, manufacturers, and service pro-
viders, which, in turn, harm American work-
ers’’; and 
(5) Congress encourages the United States 
Trade Representative, the Attorney General, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, the Secretary of Com-
merce, and the Director of the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office— 
(A) to use all available tools to ensure that 
the People’s Republic of China fully imple-
ments its commitments under the Agree-
ment; and 
(B) to actively consider additional means 
to require the People’s Republic of China to 
address unfair market access barriers, forced 
technology 
transfer 
requirements, 
and 
broader intellectual property theft concerns, 
including through future trade agreements 
and working with partners in multilateral 
organizations, such as the Group of 7 (G7), 
the Group of 20 (G20), and the World Trade 
Organization. 
(b) 
ENFORCEMENT
OF
AGREEMENT.—The 
President, acting through the United States 
Trade Representative, shall coordinate with 
the heads of such Federal agencies as the 
President considers appropriate to enforce 
the actions related to intellectual property 
laid out in the Agreement including— 
(1) the civil, administrative, and criminal 
procedures and deterrent-level civil and 
criminal penalties provided in the Agree-
ment; and 
(2) by using the full enforcement authority 
of the President, including any enforcement 
authority in connection with the identifica-
tion and reporting process under section 182 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242). 
(c) REPORT ON STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and every 180 days thereafter, the United 
States Trade Representative shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress a re-
port on the status of the implementation by 
the People’s Republic of China of its obliga-
tions under Chapter 1 of the Agreement. 
(2) INFORMATION
IN
REPORT.—Each report 
required by paragraph (1) shall contain infor-
mation sufficient to enable the appropriate 
committees of Congress to assess the extent 
of the compliance by the People’s Republic 
of China with the Agreement, including ap-
propriate quantitative metrics. 
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) AGREEMENT.—The term ‘‘Agreement’’ 
means the Economic and Trade Agreement 
Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of 
China, dated January 15, 2020. 
(2) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES

SA 1794. Mr. VAN HOLLEN sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed by him to the bill S. 1260, to 
establish a new Directorate for Tech-
nology and Innovation in the National 
Science Foundation, to establish a re-
gional technology hub program, to re-
quire a strategy and report on eco-
nomic security, science, research, inno-
vation, manufacturing, and job cre-
ation, to establish a critical supply 
chain resiliency program, and for other 
purposes; which was ordered to lie on 
the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lll. HIGH RESEARCH ACTIVITY STATUS 
HBCUS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities hold a unique position in our efforts to 
diversify the science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics academic and work-
force communities. 
(2) Even though our Nation’s Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities make up 
just 3 percent of the colleges and universities 
in the United States, they graduate 25 per-
cent of African-American students with 
bachelor’s degrees in science, technology, en-
gineering, and mathematics fields. 
(3) Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities are the institution of origin among al-
most 30 percent of Black graduates of science 
and engineering doctorate programs. 
(4) Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities are leaders of our Nation’s research 
and development enterprise, and they are 
paving the way across sectors, having re-
ceived over 100 utility patents in 40 years. 
(5) A team of computer scientists at Mor-
gan State University are conducting re-
search to automate detection of concepts in 
biomedical images to reduce the burdens of 
annotation and interpretation of medical im-
ages while providing a decision support sys-
tem for medical practitioners. 
(6) Researchers at Howard University con-
ducted a study across 6 decades to determine 
the underlying causes of the recent rapid in-
crease in the incidence and diagnosis of 
hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metas-
tases in Washington, DC, which is dispropor-
tionately impacting the Black population. 
(7) In 2019, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities received $371,000,000, or about 0.8 
percent of the $44,500,000,000 in Federal fund-
ing to institutions of higher education for re-
search and development. 
(8) This number is a marked decrease from 
fiscal year 2018, when Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities received $400,000,000 
(0.9 percent) in Federal research and develop-
ment funding. 
(9) While there are 11 high research activ-
ity status Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities—Clark 
Atlanta 
University, 
Delaware State University, Florida A&M 
University, Hampton University, Howard 
University, Jackson State University, Mor-
gan State University, North Carolina A&T 
University, 
Tennessee 
State 
University, 
Texas Southern University, and University 
of Maryland Eastern Shore—there are no 
very high research activity status Histori-
cally Black Colleges and Universities. 
(10) Meaningfully investing in the research 
capacity of Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities is an investment in our Nation’s 
future and will help meet the accelerating 
science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics workforce demands in the United 
States. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of the pro-
gram established under this section shall 
be— 
(1) to enable high research activity status 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
to achieve very high research activity sta-
tus; and 
(2) to increase the national number of Afri-
can-American undergraduate and graduate

which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the end of part II of subtitle A of title 
I of division D, add the following: 
SEC. 4128. SECURING UNITED STATES SUPPLY 
CHAINS OF STRATEGIC METALS AND 
MINERALS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Underpinned by huge demand from the 
battery sector, competition for control over 
global cobalt feedstock supply chains has in-
tensified in recent years. The People’s Re-
public of China’s increasing control over co-
balt (and other mineral) resources in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (in this 
section referred to as the ‘‘DRC’’) could pose 
a threat to United States entities seeking to 
secure supply chains for these minerals. The 
DRC hosts more than 51 percent of the global 
cobalt reserves and produces nearly 70 per-
cent of the total cobalt feedstock globally. 
(2) In early January 2021, the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China announced 
it would cancel an estimated $28,000,000 of 
loans to the DRC, repayment of which were 
due by the end of 2020, and provide $17,000,000 
in other financial support to help the DRC 
overcome the crisis caused by the COVID–19 
pandemic. During a visit to the DRC, Chi-
nese Foreign Minister Wang Yi signed an 
memorandum of understanding with the 
DRC on cooperation under the Belt and Road 
Initiative, with the DRC now becoming the 
People’s Republic of China’s 45th partner 
under that Initiative in Africa. Prior to the 
announcement, Chinese entities already con-
trolled more than 40 percent of the cobalt 
mining capacity in the DRC as a result of 
decades-long investment and development in 
the DRC, with several resource-for-infra-
structure deals having been signed and im-
plemented since the 1990s. 
(3) The People’s Republic of China is also 
the world’s leading importer of copper, iron 
ore, chromium, manganese, tantalum, nio-
bium, platinum-group metals, and lithium. 
Long-term contracts have been established 
for some imports, but for others, Chinese en-
tities have made equity investments or en-
tered joint ventures in order to secure need-
ed resources. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the Sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the current United States mineral pol-
icy of promoting an adequate, stable, and re-
liable supply of materials for United States 
national security, economic well-being, and 
industrial production is inadequate to ensure 
that United States entities have a secure 
supply chain for certain strategic metals and 
minerals; 
(2) United States mineral policy empha-
sizes developing domestic supplies of critical 
materials and encourages the private sector 
in the United States to produce and process 
those materials, but some raw materials do 
not exist in economic quantities in the 
United States, and processing, manufac-
turing, and other downstream ventures in 
the United States may not be cost competi-
tive with facilities in other regions of the 
world; 
(3) to counter Chinese dominance in the 
market for those minerals, the United States 
Government should— 
(A) support more responsible trade mis-
sions and United States commercial delega-
tions to mineral-producing countries and as-
sist smaller and less-developed countries to 
improve the transparency of their minerals 
trade, including strong support for imple-
mentation 
of 
the 
Extractive 
Industries 
Transparency Initiative, beneficial owner-
ship transparency, and the formalization of 
the artisanal mining sector; 
(B) the Department of Commerce should 
work with the Department of the Treasury 
and the Department of State to leverage re-
sources to investigate networks of corrupt 
Chinese practices in the DRC and elsewhere 
and coordinate with the Department of

Labor and U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion to ensure that minerals supply chains 
do not include products benefitting from 
forced and child labor; 
(C) the Department of Commerce, in co-
operation with other United States Govern-
ment agencies, should facilitate accessible 
de-risking for United States entities seeking 
to invest in countries such as the DRC; and 
(D) the Department of State, in coopera-
tion with other United States Government 
agencies, should provide to Congress an an-
nual report on corruption in the cobalt sec-
tor in the DRC. 
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to promote an adequate, stable, trans-
parent, and reliable supply of materials for 
United States national security, economic 
well-being, and industrial production, in-
cluding by developing international supply 
chain options that do not rely primarily or 
exclusively on the domestic private sector or 
corrupt sources abroad to produce and proc-
ess those materials; 
(2) to counter Chinese dominance in the 
production of certain metals and minerals, 
including cobalt, by facilitating the competi-
tiveness of United States entities to work in 
markets currently dominated by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; and 
(3) to promote a responsible minerals sup-
ply chain that counters corruption by the 
People’s Republic of China and all actors 
and, to that end, the Department of the 
Treasury should focus on tools, including 
network sanctions, anti-money laundering 
measures, and other actions to counter 
kleptocratic and illicit actors in global min-
eral supply chains.

foreign investment risks, would benefit from 
greater integration or collocation to support 
cross-governmental collaboration and col-
laboration with critical infrastructure oper-
ators; 
(6) identify facility needs for a national 
supply chain intelligence center to ade-
quately host personnel, maintain sensitive 
compartmented information facilities, and

grator of public-private efforts to create, 
analyze, and disseminate supply chain intel-
ligence products; 
(7) assess the resources, funding, and per-
sonnel required for a national supply chain 
intelligence center to fulfill its mission as 
the primary center for supply chain intel-
ligence in the Federal Government and an 
integrator of public-private efforts to create, 
analyze, and disseminate supply chain intel-
ligence products; 
(8) assess continuing gaps and limitations 
in the ability of the Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence to provide for greater 
centralization of Federal Government supply 
chain intelligence efforts, including whether 
to create national intelligence officer and 
national intelligence manager positions for 
national supply chain security; 
(9) assess continuing limitations or hurdles 
in the security clearance program for private 
sector partners and in integrating private 
sector partners into a national supply chain 
intelligence center; 
(10) assess continuing limitations or hur-
dles in downgrading intelligence from a 
higher to lower level of classification, or cre-
ating tear lines for private sector partners; 
and 
(11) recommend procedures and criteria for 
increasing and expanding the participation 
and integration of public- and private-sector 
personnel into Federal Government supply 
chain intelligence efforts.

SYSTEM 
PRO-
GRAM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Apollo 11 landing on July 20, 1969, 
marked the first steps of a human being on 
the surface of another world, representing a 
giant leap for all humanity and a significant 
demonstration of the spaceflight capabilities 
of the United States. 
(2) Section 202(a) of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration Author-
ization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(a)) estab-
lishes for the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration the long-term goals of 
expanding human presence in space and es-
tablishing a thriving space economy in low- 
Earth orbit and beyond. 
(3) The 2017 National Security Strategy 
designates the human exploration of the 
solar system as a strategic priority for the 
United States. 
(4) Establishing and ensuring the sustain-
ability of human space exploration of the 
solar system, as called for in the Space Pol-
icy 
Directive–1 
entitled 
‘‘Reinvigorating 
America’s Human Space Exploration Pro-
gram’’ (82 Fed. Reg. 239 (December 11, 2017)) 
and the National Space Exploration Cam-
paign Report of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration issued in Sep-
tember 2018, will require carrying out human 
exploration and related extravehicular ac-
tivities on the surface of other celestial bod-
ies in a safe and cost-effective manner. 
(5) The Johnson Space Center has decades 
of experience working with international 
partners, other Federal agencies, and part-
ners in industry and academia to study, de-
velop, and carry out the human spaceflight 
priorities of the United States. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) advances in space technology and space 
exploration capabilities ensure the long- 
term technological preeminence, economic 
competitiveness, STEM workforce develop-
ment, and national security of the United 
States; 
(2) the development of technologies that 
enable human exploration of the lunar sur-
face and other celestial bodies is critical to 
the space industrial base of the United 
States; 
(3) commercial entities in the United 
States have made significant investment and 
progress toward the development of human- 
class lunar landers; 
(4) NASA developed the Artemis program— 
(A) to fulfill the goal of landing United 
States astronauts, including the first woman 
and the next man, on the Moon; and 
(B) to collaborate with commercial and 
international partners to establish sustain-
able lunar exploration by 2028; 
(5) in carrying out the Artemis program, 
the Administrator should ensure that the en-
tire Artemis program is inclusive and rep-
resentative of all people of the United 
States, including women and minorities; and 
(6) maintaining multiple technically cred-
ible providers within NASA commercial pro-
grams is a best practice that reduces pro-
grammatic risk. 
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to bolster the domestic space tech-
nology industrial base, using existing tools 
and authorities, particularly in areas central 
to competition between the United States 
and the People’s Republic of China; 
(2) to mitigate threats and minimize chal-
lenges to the superiority of the United 
States in space technology, including lunar

TITLE IV—INDIVIDUAL TAX PROVISIONS 
MADE PERMANENT 
SEC. ll01. FINDINGS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Innovation in the United States has 
been and will continue to be the main driver 
of 
technological 
progress 
and 
economic 
growth. 
(2) Taxation, in the form of both personal 
income taxes and corporate income taxes, 
matters for innovation along the intensive 
and extensive margins and both at the micro 
and macro levels. 
(3) From 1900 to 2000, States with the most 
innovations 
also 
witnessed 
the 
fastest 
growth. 
(4) Globally, the evidence demonstrates 
that countries with an overall lower tax bur-
den will enjoy a higher level of innovation, 
greater quality of innovation, and more ro-
bust inventive activity. 
(5) Efficient tax policy can provide effec-
tive incentives for many economic activities, 
including innovation. 
(6) Inefficient tax policy can create heavy, 
deadweight burdens, hurt incentives, and 
slow down innovation. 
(7) High rates of corporate and personal in-
come taxation negatively affect the quan-
tity, quality, and location of innovation at 
the individual, organizational, and State 
level.

SEC. 2645A. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMERCIAL 
SMALLSAT DATA PROGRAM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Section 60501 of title 51, United States 
Code, states that the goal of the Administra-
tion’s Earth science program is ‘‘to pursue a 
program of Earth observations, research, and 
applications activities to better understand 
the Earth, how it supports life, and how 
human activities affect its ability to do so in 
the future’’. 
(2) Section 50115 title 51, United States 
Code, directs the Administrator to acquire 
space-based and airborne Earth remote sens-
ing data, services, distribution, and applica-
tions from a commercial provider. 
(3) In 2019, the Administrator established 
the Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition 
Pilot Program to identify, evaluate, and ac-
quire data from commercial sources that 
support NASA’s Earth science research and 
application goals, and NASA has— 
(A) determined, in its 2020 final evaluation 
entitled ‘‘Commercial SmallSat Data Acqui-
sition Program Pilot Evaluation Report’’, 
that the program has been a success; 
(B) expanded its procurement arrange-
ments with commercial vendors to provide 
Earth remote sensing data and imagery to 
NASA-funded scientists; and 
(C) sought to increase the number of com-
mercial vendors, expand acquisition of com-
mercial data products, and broaden user ac-
cess despite a lack of corresponding growth 
in the program’s budget.

lication of— 
‘‘(1) data for scientific purposes; or 
‘‘(2) information that enhances the original 
data of a vendor. 
‘‘(c) FUNDING.—The Administrator may ob-
ligate such sums as necessary— 
‘‘(1) to procure from commercial vendors 
the remote sensing data and imagery nec-
essary to advance NASA scientific research 
and applications; and 
‘‘(2) to establish or modify end-use license 
terms and conditions to allow individuals 
other than NASA-funded users to use such 
procured data and imagery. 
‘‘(d) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this section, 
and annually thereafter, the Administrator 
shall submit to the appropriate committees 
of Congress a report that includes the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(1) A list of all vendors that provide re-
mote sensing data and imagery to NASA. 
‘‘(2) The end-use license terms and condi-
tions for each such vendor. 
‘‘(3) A description of the manner in which 
each such vendor is advancing scientific re-
search and applications, including the prior-
ities recommended in the decadal surveys of 
the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine. 
‘‘(4) A determination as to whether the Ad-
ministrator has entered into any agreement 
with a commercial vendor or any other civil-
ian agency that permits the use of data and 
imagery by Federal Government employees, 
contractors, or non-Federal users.’’.

SEC. 5214. COORDINATION OF SCREENING OF 
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Strategic investment through foreign 
direct investment has emerged as a threat 
posed by countries that do not abide by or 
respect the rules-based, global trading sys-
tem. 
(2) Such countries continue to exploit gaps 
in the uncoordinated and divided framework 
among countries that do abide by the rules- 
based, global trading system, both in devel-
oped countries by investments in critical 
technologies and supply chains and devel-
oping countries, while creating depend-
encies, debt traps, and exploitation of nat-
ural resources without improving the living 
conditions in such countries. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should work 
with other developed countries that abide by 
the rules-based, global trading system to im-
prove the effectiveness of their screening of 
foreign direct investment through better co-
ordination, including by— 
(1) establishing a group dedicated to im-
proving such screening at a forum of heads of 
state, such as the Group of 7; 
(2) developing and agreeing to written best 
practices and a commitment to sharing rel-
evant information at the ministerial level; 
and 
(3) using technical assistance to assist de-
veloping countries in establishing foreign di-
rect investment screening mechanisms. 
(c) REPORT ON COORDINATION OF SCREENING 
OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of State, shall sub-
mit to appropriate committees of Congress a 
report on the work done as of the date of the 
report under section 721(c)(3) of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565(c)(3)) to 
establish a formal process for the exchange 
of information relating to foreign invest-
ment with countries that are allies or part-
ners of the United States. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a description of the work described in 
paragraph (1), including a list of the coun-
tries and engagements as of the date of the 
report conducted under section 721(c)(3) of

tablished under that section;

as of the date of the report under that sec-
tion, disaggregated by fiscal year, country, 
and purpose; 
(D) a description of plans to establish a 
forum at the Group of 7 or other forum to

eign direct investment screening, best prac-
tices, and technical assistance to foreign 
countries, or any other actions taken or

‘‘(o) PROVISIONS RELATED
TO SEPARATION 
AND RETIREMENT INCENTIVES.— 
‘‘(1) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the 
term ‘employee’— 
‘‘(A) means an employee of the Adminis-
tration serving under an appointment with-
out time limitation; and 
‘‘(B) does not include— 
‘‘(i) a reemployed annuitant under sub-
chapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 
5 or any other retirement system for employ-
ees of the Federal Government; 
‘‘(ii) an employee having a disability on

tion incentives under this subsection, an em-
ployee who is in receipt of a decision notice 
of involuntary separation for misconduct or 
unacceptable performance. 
‘‘(2) AUTHORITY.—The Administrator may 
establish a program under which employees 
may be eligible for early retirement, offered 
separation incentive pay to separate from 
service voluntarily, or both. This authority 
may be used to reduce the number of per-
sonnel employed or to restructure the work-
force to meet mission objectives without re-
ducing the overall number of personnel. This 
authority is in addition to, and notwith-
standing, any other authorities established 
by law or regulation for such programs. 
‘‘(3) EARLY RETIREMENT.—An employee who 
is at least 50 years of age and has completed 
20 years of service, or has at least 25 years of 
service, may, pursuant to regulations pro-
mulgated under this subsection, apply and be 
retired from the Administration and receive 
benefits in accordance with subchapter III of 
chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 if the employee has 
been employed continuously within the Ad-
ministration for more than 30 days before 
the date on which the determination to con-
duct a reduction or restructuring within 1 or 
more Administration centers is approved. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATIONS ON REEMPLOYMENT.— 
‘‘(A) An employee who receives separation 
pay under such program may not be reem-
ployed by the Administration for a 12-month 
period beginning on the effective date of the 
employee’s separation, unless this prohibi-
tion is waived by the Administrator on a 
case-by-case basis. 
‘‘(B) An employee who receives separation 
pay under this section on the basis of a sepa-
ration and accepts employment with the 
Government of the United States, or who 
commences work through a personal services 
contract with the United States within 5 
years after the date of the separation on 
which payment of the separation pay is 
based, shall be required to repay the entire 
amount of the separation pay to the Admin-
istration. If the employment is with an Exec-
utive agency (as defined by section 105 of 
title 5) other than the Administration, the 
Administrator may, at the request of the 
head of that agency, waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is within the Administration, the Adminis-
trator may waive the repayment if the indi-
vidual involved is the only qualified appli-
cant available for the position. If the em-
ployment is with an entity in the legislative 
branch, the head of the entity or the ap-
pointing official may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is with the judicial branch, the Director of 
the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. 
‘‘(5) REGULATIONS.—Under the program es-
tablished under paragraph (2), early retire-
ment and separation pay may be offered only 
pursuant to regulations established by the 
Administrator, subject to such limitations 
or conditions as the Administrator may re-
quire. 
‘‘(6) USE OF EXISTING FUNDS.—The Adminis-
trator shall carry out this subsection using 
amounts otherwise made available to the Ad-
ministrator and no additional funds are au-
thorized to be appropriated to carry out this 
subsection.’’. 
(b) VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAY-
MENTS.— 
Subchapter II of chapter 35 of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in section 3521— 
(A) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting

elevate risk factors leading to such emer-
gence, 
reemergence, 
or 
transmission 
of 
pathogens; and 
(3) the methods by which the United States 
might work with international partners to 
effectively promote diversified alternative 
sources of food and protein in communities

SEC. 3299C. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that global in-
stitutions, including the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO), the World Organisation for Animal 
Health (OIE), and the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), together with leading non-
governmental organizations, veterinary col-
leges, and the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), should 
promote the paradigm of One Health—the in-
tegration of human health, animal health, 
agriculture, ecosystems, and the environ-
ment as an effective and integrated way to 
address the complexity of emerging disease 
threats, and should support improved com-
munity health, biodiversity conservation, 
forest conservation and management, sus-
tainable agriculture, and safety of livestock 
production in developing countries, particu-
larly in tropical landscapes where there is an 
elevated risk of zoonotic disease spill over. 
SEC. 3299D. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) support the availability of scalable and 
sustainable alternative sources of protein 
and nutrition for local communities, where 
appropriate, in order to minimize human re-
liance on the commercial trade in live wild-
life and raw or unprocessed wildlife parts and 
derivatives for human consumption; 
(2) support foreign governments to— 
(A) prevent commercial trade in live wild-
life and raw or unprocessed wildlife parts and 
derivatives for human consumption; 
(B) transition from the sale of such wildlife 
for human consumption in markets and res-
taurants to alternate protein and nutritional 
sources; and 
(C) establish and effectively manage pro-
tected and conserved areas, particularly in 
countries with tropical forest hotspots for 
emerging diseases, including indigenous and 
community-conserved areas;

(3) respect the rights and needs of indige-
nous people and local communities depend-
ent on such wildlife for nutritional needs and 
food security; and 
(4) facilitate international cooperation by 
working with international partners through 
intergovernmental, international, and non-
governmental organizations such as the 
United Nations to— 
(A) lead a resolution at the United Nations 
Security Council or General Assembly and 
World Health Assembly outlining the danger 
to human and animal health from emerging 
zoonotic 
infectious 
diseases, 
with 
rec-
ommendations for implementing the closure 
of wildlife markets and prevention of the 
commercial trade in live wildlife for human 
consumption except where the consumption 
of wildlife is necessary for local food secu-
rity or where such actions would signifi-
cantly disrupt a readily available and irre-
placeable food supply; 
(B) raise awareness on the dangerous po-
tential of wildlife markets as a source of 
zoonotic diseases and reduce demand for the 
consumption of wildlife through evidence- 
based behavior change programs, while en-
suring that existing wildlife habitat is not 
encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
process; 
(C) encourage and support alternative 
forms of sustainable food production, farm-
ing, and shifts to sustainable sources of pro-
tein and nutrition instead of terrestrial wild-
life where able and appropriate, and reduce 
consumer demand for terrestrial wildlife 
through enhanced local and national food 
systems, especially in areas where wildlife 
markets play a significant role in meeting 
subsistence needs while ensuring that exist-
ing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon 
or destroyed as part of this process; and 
(D) strive to increase hygienic standards 
implemented in markets around the globe, 
especially those specializing in the sale of 
products intended for human consumption.

CELEBRATING THE 149TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF ARBOR DAY 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration and the 
Senate now proceed to S. Res. 194. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 194) celebrating the 
149th anniversary of Arbor Day. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I know of no 
further debate on the measure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
agreeing to the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 194) was 
agreed to. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I ask unani-
mous consent that the King amend-
ment to the preamble at the desk be 
agreed 
to, 
that 
the 
preamble, 
as 
amended, be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the amendment to the pre-
amble? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 1875) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
In the preamble, strike the tenth whereas 
clause and insert ‘‘Whereas sustainably 
grown wood can be used in a wide variety of 
resilient infrastructure and building applica-
tions—from traditional timber framing to 
high-tech mass timber—and as a natural, re-
newable, and biodegradable material, the 
significant use of wood building materials in 
buildings and bridges helps decrease global 
carbon emissions;’’. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, as 
amended, was agreed to as follows: 
S. RES. 194 
Whereas Arbor Day was founded on April 
10, 1872, to recognize the importance of 
planting trees; 
Whereas Arbor Day is a time to recognize 
the importance of trees and an opportunity 
for communities to gather and plant for a 
greener future; 
Whereas Arbor Day is observed in all 50 
States and across the world; 
Whereas participating in Arbor Day activi-
ties promotes civic participation and high-
lights the importance of planting and caring 
for trees and vegetation; 
Whereas such activities provide an oppor-
tunity to convey to future generations the 
value of land and stewardship; 
Whereas working forests have contributed 
to an increase in the number of trees planted 
in the United States and are sustainably 
managed, with less than 2 percent of working 
forests nationally harvested each year; 
Whereas a key factor in preventing forest 
conversion and deforestation is keeping for-
ests productive; 
Whereas working forests are a critical part 
of a nature-based solution to climate change, 
and by providing a continuous cycle of grow-
ing, harvesting, and replanting, active forest 
management maximizes the ability to se-
quester and store carbon and improves forest 
resilience; 
Whereas private forests play an important 
role in conserving at-risk and declining spe-
cies, and collaborative conservation efforts 
can benefit species while also helping to 
keep forests as forests; 
Whereas sustainably grown wood can be 
used in a wide variety of resilient infrastruc-
ture and building applications—from tradi-
tional timber framing to high-tech mass 
timber—and as a natural, renewable, and 
biodegradable material, the significant use 
of wood building materials in buildings and 
bridges helps decrease global carbon emis-
sions; 
Whereas the Arbor Day Foundation and 
the Tree City USA program have been com-
mitted to greening cities and towns across 
the country since 1976, and in that time, 
more than 3,400 communities have made the 
commitment to becoming a Tree City USA; 
Whereas Tree City USA communities are 
home to more than 143,000,000 people in the 
United States who are dedicated to core 
standards of sound urban forestry manage-
ment and who dedicate resources and time to 
urban forestry initiatives, which helps make 
their communities and our country a better 
place to live; 
Whereas National Arbor Day is observed on 
the last Friday of April each year; and 
Whereas April 30, 2021, marks the 149th an-
niversary of Arbor Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes April 30, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Arbor Day’’; 
(2) celebrates the 149th anniversary of 
Arbor Day; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Arbor Day; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to participate in National Arbor Day 
activities. 
f

Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of S. 
Res. 228, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 228) designating May 
15, 2021, as ‘‘Kids to Parks Day’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I ask unani-
mous consent that the resolution be 
agreed to, that the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 228) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in my 
lifetime, China has gone from a poor 
and isolated country to now account-
ing for nearly 20 percent of global gross 
domestic product. There is no doubt 
that the ingenuity of the Chinese peo-
ple has contributed to this success, but 
we know the driving force behind this 
dramatic rise is the aggressiveness of 
the Chinese Communist Party. Its aims 
can be summed up with four R’s: resist, 
reduce, replace, and reorder. 
China resists American economic in-
fluence 
by 
manipulating 
American 
businesses and industries and stealing 
intellectual property. It reduces inter-
nal dissent and free expression of ideas 
through mass surveillance and censor-
ship of its own people, and it seeks to 
exert its power and influence in the 
United States. The Chinese Communist 
Party intends to replace America as 
the world’s technology leader through 
the Made in China 2025 initiative, 
which seeks to achieve Chinese domi-
nance in high-tech manufacturing. Fi-
nally, it hopes to reorder international 
norms and institutions around itself. 
That is their vision. That is their 
strategy. That is their plan. 
Now, the Chinese Communist Party’s 
ruling strategy can best be described as 
‘‘win at all costs.’’ In other words, they 
do not play by the same rules we do. 
And make no mistake, these ambitions 
paint an alarming picture for the 
United States and our allies. 
Former Attorney General Bill Barr 
said last year: ‘‘It is clear that the 
PRC,’’ or People’s Republic of China, 
‘‘seeks not merely to join the ranks of 
other advanced industrial economies, 
but to replace them altogether.’’ 
In everything from electric cars to 
advanced robotics, to artificial intel-
ligence, China aspires to lead global

production and to dominate global pro-
duction, and they are throwing serious 
money into the effort to get China 
there. China is expected to spend $1.4 
trillion by 2025 covering investments in 
everything from 5G to artificial intel-
ligence. 
This is not the time for the United 
States to be complacent, to sit back 
and watch the Chinese Communist 
Party pursue tech domination. By the 
time it has made significant progress, 
we would be too late. We need to take 
action now to ensure that our economy 
and our military can continue to 
outcompete China, and that is pre-
cisely what we can achieve through the 
Endless Frontier Act. 
As Leader MCCONNELL said, a robust 
amendment process will be critical to 
this piece of legislation. As I was dis-
cussing with Senator SCHUMER
this 
morning, for most Members, this 1,500- 
page substitute bill landed on their 
desks just a little bit earlier this week, 
so it is going to take a little time for 
us to understand and to digest the 
complexity and the ambitions, really, I 
should say, of this bill. 
In the coming days, I hope the Sen-
ate will vote on amendments from 
Members 
on 
both 
sides 
that 
will 
strengthen this legislation and ensure 
that it addresses the broad range of 
strategic threats we are facing. 
One of the most urgent priorities is 
to secure the supply chains of our most 
important products. We really learned 
that from the pandemic. When the 
COVID–19 virus hit, starting in China 
and then spreading around the world, 
we learned that China made most of 
the personal protective equipment in 
the world, and thus we were competing 
with China and other parts of the world 
to get access to the personal protective 
equipment that our first responders, 
our frontline healthcare workers, and 
others needed in order to be safe. That 
was one of the first signs that our sup-
ply chains may be vulnerable. 
But before any piece of technology 
becomes usable for its audience, it in-
cludes parts and pieces and materials 
that literally come from around the 
world. 
This 
was 
the 
theory 
of 
globalization: Go wherever this product 
can be produced the least expensively. 
But we didn’t count on pandemics. We 
didn’t count on natural disasters. We 
didn’t count on the potential for mili-
tary conflict to jeopardize the avail-
ability of these essential products. Re-
gardless of where a product is finally 
assembled and packaged, each of those 
individual pieces is key to protecting 
the supply chains of our most valuable 
assets. 
Right now, supply chains for every-
thing from cars and cell phones to mis-
sile defense, to communication sys-
tems are at risk because of one tiny 
piece of technology called a semicon-
ductor or a microelectric chip. It goes 
by numerous names. 
I have shown a floor chart pre-
viously, and I will probably bring it out 
again sometime here before we are 
through, but the fact is, the United 
States relies heavily on other countries 
for these essential advanced semi-
conductors. 
Nearly 90 percent of those chips are 
made by companies in Southeast Asia, 
including Taiwan. As a matter of fact, 
Taiwan alone produces 63 percent of 
the world’s advanced semiconductors, 
and we depend on that sole source for 
these most advanced microchips. One 
company, Taiwan Semiconductor, ac-
counted for more than half of the total 
foundry revenues last year, and, as I 
said, companies in Taiwan control 63 
percent of the market. 
If for any reason that supply chain 
was cut off, it would lead to very, very 
serious economic and security con-
sequences across our entire economy. 
In recent months, we have gotten a 
glimpse of what this might look like, 
particularly when it comes to our car 
manufacturing capacity. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, 
automaker suppliers predicted a drop 
in car sales, and so they canceled their 
orders for semiconductor chips. Semi-
conductor manufacturers replaced the 
auto chip capacity with other in-de-
mand products, like chips for personal 
computers that kept kids learning 
while they were at home or chips that 
went into ventilators to keep COVID–19 
patients alive. But American con-
sumers 
kept 
buying 
cars 
at 
prepandemic rates, and the carmakers 
needed to make up for the chips to 
meet that demand. Unfortunately, re-
storing the production of auto chips is 
not a quick or easy process. There is a 
long lead time, in fact, to manufac-
turing a single chip, which can take up 
to 6 months. 
Although chipmakers are filling auto 
chip orders, we are still likely to face a 
shortage that may last throughout the 
summer. In response, some automakers 
have removed certain technology and 
extra features, like GPS, from vehicles 
in order to reduce the number of chips 
they need. Others have cut production 
across the board and laid off some of 
their workforce. But as bad as that 
may sound, it could be much, much 
worse. 
The squeeze we are feeling now is 
more or less the result of a backlog, 
and we have every expectation that in 
a few months, things will return to 
normal. But what if, instead of a de-
crease in supply due to increased de-
mand, the supply was cut off entirely? 
This is not some fictional doomsday 
scenario; it is a real possibility. Our de-
pendence on other countries for these 
chips could leave us in a very vulner-
able position if access were suddenly 
cut off or restricted. 
Unlike the supply chain shortages we 
experienced at the start of the pan-
demic for things like PPE, hand sani-
tizer, and the like, there is no quick fix 
here. In order to build a single chip, 
you need very expensive and highly ad-
vanced 
equipment. 
You 
need 
the 
skilled workforce. And, as I said before, 
you need quite a bit of time because it 
can take months to build a single chip, 
and that is assuming you have the fa-
cility and all the equipment ready to 
go. 
A couple of weeks ago, I met with ex-
ecutives in Dallas who represent a full 
range of businesses and industries im-
pacted by the current chip shortage. 
An executive at Qorvo talked about 
how the process of building a new chip 
fabrication facility isn’t just expen-
sive; it is time-consuming. It can take 
years to receive all of the high-func-
tioning equipment necessary to build 
advanced microchips. Building a found-
ry is a huge undertaking that requires 
a massive investment. A single foundry 
where these advanced semiconductors 
are built can cost upwards of $10 to $20 
billion—$10 to $20 billion. Indeed, that 
is the reason why we are so reliant on 
Taiwan, because it is a low-cost pro-
vider. Again, we made the mistake of 
thinking that cost was the only thing 
that mattered, as opposed to depend-
ability of our supply chain. So there is 
a clear need to bolster our domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing. 
The United States is not the only 
country that sees the handwriting on 
the wall. Other parts of the world, from 
South Korea to China itself, to the Eu-
ropean Union, are investing billions of 
dollars in new manufacturing capacity. 
Right now, as I speak, there is one 
semiconductor foundry being planned 
for Arizona by Taiwan Semiconductor. 
China is building 17 while we are just 
getting started to build 1. 
As I said, the European Union is in-
vesting huge amounts of money, about 
$35 billion; South Korea is investing $65 
billion; and China is investing a whop-
ping $150 billion in semiconductor man-
ufacturing. Other countries around the 
world recognize the risks to their econ-
omy and their national security given 
the current semiconductor manufac-
turing landscape. 
Our competitors are pouring tens of 
billions of dollars into boosting their 
supplies, and the United States needs 
to do likewise, which is why Senator 
WARNER, the Senator from Virginia, 
and I introduced CHIPS for America 
Act last year. The premise of this legis-
lation is straightforward: to create a 
Federal incentive program to encour-
age chip manufacturing here in the 
U.S. of A. Rather than rely on manu-
facturers in Taiwan or China or com-
pete against other countries for the 
limited supply of chips worldwide, let’s 
bolster the supply of American-made 
semiconductors. This way, we can se-
cure our most critical supply chains, 
create thousands of well-paying Amer-
ican jobs, and boost our global com-
petitiveness 
by 
supplying 
made-in- 
America chips to our friends and allies 
around the world. 
We weren’t alone in thinking this is 
a good idea. In fact, when we consid-
ered the authorization for this CHIPS 
for America Act in the Defense author-
ization bill last December, it passed 
with a vote of 96 to 4. So it is clear that 
the entire Senate understands the

gravity of this issue and its impor-
tance. That authorization became law 
in January, and now we have the job of 
fully funding these programs so they 
can actually get to work turning over 
dirt and getting these foundries off the 
ground. 
The strong support for this legisla-
tion on a bipartisan basis shows that 
this is a priority for a majority of the 
Members of this body. There is no rea-
son these funding programs shouldn’t 
be bipartisan too. 
We are already seeing divisions about 
provisions related to the payment of a 
prevailing wage, so-called Davis-Bacon 
provisions, which is, frankly, dividing 
us, which is a moot issue given the cur-
rent wages of U.S. semiconductor man-
ufacturing companies. It is a nonissue 
for them. Yet some of our Democratic 
colleagues decided to insert this divi-
sive issue in this underlying Endless 
Frontier bill. 
We should not allow unnecessary or 
purely political provisions to weaken 
our strong support to our consensus 
commitment to deal with these vulner-
able supply chains. I am committed to 
securing funding to bolster our domes-
tic semiconductor manufacturing, and 
there have been a lot of conversations 
about the most effective way to do so. 
But let me be clear. The Davis-Bacon 
provisions inserted into the committee 
markup in the Endless Frontier bill is 
jeopardizing this funding. 
I hope our friends on the other side of 
the aisle will work with us in good 
faith to come up with a compromise 
that allows this funding to pass with 
broad bipartisan support, just like the 
CHIPS for America Act. There is a 
clear and present need and, I might 
say, a clear and present danger to the 
United States. 
We need to bolster our domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing and se-
cure one of our most vulnerable supply 
chains. As I said, this is a matter of 
both our economic and national secu-
rity and something far too important 
to fall prey to partisan jockeying.

LETTER 
TO 
PRESIDENT 
BIDEN 
FROM THE AMERICAN HELLENIC 
INSTITUTE ON THE STATE OF 
U.S.-GREECE RELATIONS 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, as the founder and Co-Chair 
of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic 
Issues, I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the American Hellenic Institute to President 
Biden regarding the Institute’s present per-
spective on the state of the U .S.-Greece rela-
tions. The letter includes discussion of issues 
on defense, security, and counterterrorism; 
international commerce and trade and energy 
security; and the Cyprus Issue. 
APRIL 22, 2021. 
President JOSEPH R. BIDEN, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: On behalf of the 
nationwide membership of the American 
Hellenic Institute (AHI), thank you for your 
remarks to commemorate the 200th anniver-
sary of Greek Independence. Although many 
aspects of your remarks resonated with the 
Greek American community, the following 
excerpt struck a chord: 
‘‘What really binds us together are our val-
ues. We are two people rooted in a common 
conviction that every human being is enti-
tled to be treated with dignity. And it is our 
shared 
commitment 
to 
liberty, 
human 
rights, and the rule of law, that empowers us 
to write our own futures, whether 200 years 
ago or today.’’ 
Mr. President, the momentous occasion to 
mark Greece’s Bicentennial provides the op-
portunity to convey the Institute’s present 
perspective on the state of U.S.-Greece rela-
tions, which is flourishing under the ‘‘shared 
commitment to liberty, human rights, and 
the rule of law’’ that you correctly and elo-
quently stated. Unfortunately, malign actors 
in the region, especially Turkey, display a 
blatant and an intense disregard for these 
shared values with provocative actions that 
threaten the United States’ allies and stra-
tegic partners as well as our interests in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. 
It is in the United States’ best interest for 
Southeastern Europe and the Eastern Medi-
terranean to be politically, economically and 
socially stable, and for democratic principles 
to flourish, including adherence to the rule 
of law. Greece is an immensely valuable link 
as ‘‘a pillar of stability’’ in the region as sev-
eral high-level U.S. government officials 
have noted. 
The U.S.-Greece relationship has reached 
new heights by virtue of an ongoing Stra-
tegic Dialogue, which include avenues for co-
operation across sectors, such as: regional 
cooperation, defense and security, and trade 
and investment, among others, are plotted 
for implementation. 
DEFENSE, SECURITY AND COUNTERTERRORISM 
Greece advances U.S. interests as a pivotal 
and dependable NATO and a frontline state 
against terrorism. The Mutual Defense Co-
operation Agreement between the United 
States and Greece illustrates the two allies’ 
commitment to address longterm security 
challenges in the region. The Agreement cur-
rently is under revision. After it is upgraded, 
it will offer more flexibility to deepen co-
operation in the defense sector, according to 
Greece’s 
Minister 
of 
Defense 
Nikos 
Panagiotopoulos, with whom I held a public 
discussion last month. For its part, Greece 
further demonstrates its commitment to the 
Alliance as one of a minority of NATO mem-
bers to meet NATO’s minimum standard on 
defense expenditures; second only to the 
U.S., by percentage. To demonstrate further: 
Souda Bay, Crete: in our view, the most 
important U.S. military facility in the Medi-
terranean Sea from where in the past joint 
USN/USAF reconnaissance missions and air 
refueling support for U.S. and NATO oper-
ations were implemented successfully and 
continues to be immensely important. 
NATO Joint-Command HQ: Thessaloniki 
hosts a NATO Rapid Deployment Corps com-
bined with its Third Army Corps for two 
years. 
Operation Atlantic Resolve: Greece enables 
a substantial portion of the U.S. Army’s 10th 
Combat Aviation Brigade to enter the Euro-
pean 
theater 
through 
the 
port 
of 
Thessaloniki 
and 
to 
depart 
through 
Alexandropoulis. Alexandroupolis is being 
recognized 
as 
a 
city 
with 
increased 
geostrategic importance, which can also con-
tribute to economic development and energy 
security. 
USAF temporarily operated MQ–9 Reaper 
Drones from Greece’s Larisa Air Force Base. 
The 101st Combat Aviation Brigade of the 
U.S. Army, from October–Nov 20, 2020 and 
from February–Mar 21, 2021, stationed and 
trained at Volos and Stefanovikeio. 
It is evident Greece contributes signifi-
cantly to U.S. interests. However, it becomes 
increasingly challenging for Greece to fulfill 
this important role when it constantly is ex-
pending valuable resources to defend itself 
against aggressive and provocative behavior 
emanating from a fellow NATO member, 
Turkey. 
Turkey engaged in over 7,000 violations of 
Greece’s territorial waters and airspace in 
2020. There were 4,605 airspace and 3,215 mari-
time incidents. 
Turkey’s routine challenges to Greece’s 
sovereignty must cease and desist. In fact, 
Greece’s Chief of the Hellenic National De-
fense General Staff, General Konstantinos 
Floros, called out Turkey’s provocative be-
havior, stating to an AHI audience on April 
1, 2021 that Turkey threatens ‘‘Greece’s sov-
ereign rights.’’ In this context, Gen. Floros 
explicitly cited as example the maritime 
border Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
between Turkey and Libya. In addition, U.S. 
Ambassador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt has 
called 
the 
MoU 
‘‘unhelpful’’ 
and 
‘‘escalatory’’ in nature in previous public 
statements. Ambassador Pyatt also affirmed 
the internationally recognized legal concept 
that ‘‘inhabited islands as a matter of cus-
tomary international law are entitled to the 
same treatment as continental territory.’’ 
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND TRADE AND 
ENERGY SECURITY 
Greece also is an important player in 
international commerce and trade, espe-
cially via its shipping industry. According to 
Greek shipping industry statistics, 22.5% and 
20.3% of the Greek-owned fleet’s activity is 
dedicated to the U.S. and the European 
trade, respectively; and ‘‘Greek-owned ships 
represent almost 21% of the global ton-
nage.’’’ 
AHI requests the Administration maintain 
high-level engagement with Greece on eco-
nomic relations and encourages future U.S.- 
Greece economic relationships to pursue 
commercial partnerships and opportunities 
for more U.S. investment in Greece. 
However, it is important to note that Tur-
key also threatens Greece’s economic devel-
opment. Turkey exploits its control over the 
flow of migrants to Europe, in essence, 
weaponizing them. Historically, Greece has 
carried the heavy burden of migrant flows to 
Europe, which has had a detrimental impact 
upon Greece’s economy. Prime Minister 
Mitsotakis has been very clear to state that 
Turkey bears its responsibility due to Tur-
key’s ability to control ‘‘the flows in the Ae-
gean.’’ 
Moreover, Turkey’s threat to energy secu-
rity in the region is not in the best interests 
of the United States and stymies Greece’s 
potential as an energy hub. Turkey has en-
croached upon Greece’s continental shelf off 
the coast of the Greek island complex of 
Kastellorizo in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Sea. This island complex is sovereign Greek 
territory. It has a continental shelf as de-
fined under the UN Convention on the Law of 
the Sea which is part of the Greek conti-
nental shelf. The island complex is also part 
of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which 
is available to Greece. Ambassador Pyatt un-
derscored upholding international law when 
he stated the U.S. position that islands have 
‘‘exactly the same’’ continental shelf and ex-
clusive economic zone rights as does any 
mainland territory. ‘‘I have also made a 
point on many occasions . . . that the United 
States adheres to the principal of inter-
national maritime law that islands, includ-
ing Kastellorizo, have exactly the same con-
tinental shelf and EEZ rights as does any 
mainland 
territory,’’ 
Ambassador 
Pyatt 
stated to reporters on July 23, 2020. 
Turkey also has exercised ‘‘gunboat diplo-
macy’’ in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turk-
ish drillships have been in Cypriot waters, 
conducting activities illegally in violation of 
Cyprus’ sovereignty and international law. 
AHI welcomes the United States’ stated sup-
port for the Republic of Cyprus’s right to de-
velop its natural resources, including in its 
exclusive economic zone. 
THE CYPRUS ISSUE 
A key to peace and stability in the region 
is for good neighborly relations among 
NATO members and respect for the rule of 
law. However, Turkey’s continuing occupa-
tion of Cyprus, which is a member of the Eu-
ropean Union; its intransigence in solving 
the Cyprus problem, and its refusal to recog-
nize the Republic of Cyprus, are detrimental 
to U.S. interests. To illustrate Turkey’s in-
transigence, Turkey insists on maintaining 
troop levels in Cyprus and on remaining a 
guarantor power as part of a solution to the 
Cyprus issue, which led to the collapse of 
settlement talks in 2017. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s re-
sponse on the Cyprus issue during a March 
10th, 2021 House Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs hearing is welcomed: ‘‘We strongly sup-
port a comprehensive settlement that reuni-
fies Cyprus in a Bicommunal Federation. We

engage in the effort to advance that pros-
pect, including the supportive role of the 
United Nations, and as well, direct American 
engagement in that effort. So I think you’ll 
see American diplomacy fully engage.’’ 
However, Mr. President, as a public serv-
ant who advocated for upholding the rule of 
law on Cyprus throughout your long career, 
I am reminded of your January 27, 1989 letter 
to then AHI Chairman Dean Lomis, where 
you stated: ‘‘. . . we must urge the new Ad-
ministration [President George H.W. Bush] 
to make Cyprus a higher policy priority in 
American foreign policy . . . we cannot lose 
sight of the fact that the rights of Greek 
Cypriots have been trampled upon, and we 
must ensure that their claims to ancestral 
land and property seized during the 1974 in-
vasion are not compromised. Finally, we 
must send a signal to Turkey that until it 
has removed every last soldier from Cyprus, 
it will never be recognized as a full member 
of the international community.’’ 
It is this same clear message to Turkey re-
garding Cyprus that the United States must 
send today because the conditions are the 
same, if not worse, as recent public discourse 
emanating from the Turkish government has 
called for a two-state solution. 
Mr. President, the United States-Greece 
relationship is a strong and healthy one 
thanks in large part to the shared values 
identified in your Greek Independence Day 
celebratory remarks. Greece has proven to 
be a ‘‘pillar of stability,’’ a frontline state to 
combat terrorism, and a reliable NATO ally. 
AHI anticipates that bilateral relations, 
which are at a high point, will be taken to 
even greater heights during your Adminis-
tration. By contrast, Turkey is the perpe-
trator of instability in the Eastern Medi-
terranean and broader region which is detri-
mental to U.S. security interests. Turkey is 
a failed NATO ally that cozies up to Russia 
and Iran and is a threat to U.S. allies and 
strategic partners. The U.S. must dem-
onstrate strong, unequivocal support of 
Greece by continuing to strengthen relations 
across all sectors and by applying the rule of 
law to Turkey for its illegal actions. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Sincerely, 
NICK LARIGAKIS, 
President.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP 
NATHANIEL JAMES DAVIS, SR., 
TH.D. 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor the life of Bishop Nathaniel 
James Davis, Sr., Th.D. He was profoundly 
devoted to his faith and his family, and dedi-
cated his life to serving his community. 
Bishop Davis moved to Seattle in 1955, and 
quickly became a pillar in the Christian com-
munity. He joined the Bethel Christian Church 
of the Apostolic Faith shortly after moving, 
finding a home among other service- and fam-
ily-minded members of the organization. He 
was deeply involved with the Bethel Christian 
Church, and has undoubtedly touched the 
lives of countless members of the Seattle 
community. After many years of selflessness 
and dedication, Bishop Davis became a Pas-
tor at the Bethel Christian Church, a position 
he held for 37 years. His legacy and influence 
are felt by countless members of the Church, 
where he was a fixture for more than 65 
years. 
Bishop Davis’ leadership and commitment to 
his faith extended beyond his work in Seattle. 
He was the founding Bishop of the Alaska Dis-
trict Council, serving as Diocesan of the 56th 
Episcopal District and presiding over the 
Council for 9 years. He was deeply dedicated 
to his family, and was married to Evangelist 
Dr. Addie Davis for 64 years. He leaves be-
hind his wife, 13 children, 41 grandchildren, 
and 18 great-grandchildren, who will undoubt-
edly carry on his legacy of service and leader-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and 
honor that I recognize the life of Bishop Na-
thaniel James Davis, Sr. His life and dedica-
tion to serving his community should be an in-
spiration to us all.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN 
SOLDIER 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the centennial of the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier. 
On November 11, 2021, Veteran’s Day, the 
United States will mark 100 years since the in-
ternment of an unidentifiable member of the 
American Expeditionary Forces of World War 
I at Arlington National Cemetery. 
The place of interment has come to be 
known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
and is regarded as America’s most sacred 
shrine. It is dedicated to all veterans that have 
served and made the ultimate sacrifice on be-
half of our great nation. 
My congressional district is home to over 
70,000 veterans and their families; and on this 
day and every day, we honor ALL who served 
and continue to serve our country.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER CARL 
BLUBAUGH 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Carl 
Blubaugh for his 55 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our

fighters often are called on to respond to

vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Blubaugh has worked throughout 
his career to serve the people of Somerset 
County. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I thank him for his work 
to protect life and property in our community 
and wish him continued health, safety, and 
success.

HONORING KAREN KENINGER, DI-
RECTOR OF THE NATIONAL LI-
BRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND 
AND PRINT DISABLED, IN CELE-
BRATION OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a note-
worthy occasion at the Library of Congress’s 
National Library Service for the Blind and Print 
Disabled (NLS)—the retirement of Director 
Karen Keninger. Having dedicated nearly a 
decade of service under two Librarians of 
Congress, Karen’s devotion to the NLS collec-
tion shows in the excellence she has brought 
to the program through both expansion of the 
collection and innovation of service. 
The NLS is an institution committed to serv-
ing readers with disabilities with the mission of 
ensuring ‘‘that all may read’’. Offering free 
braille and talking book library services for 
people with temporary or permanent reading 
disabilities, the NLS has played an instru-
mental part in ensuring that the Library of 
Congress’ collection can be enjoyed by all 
Americans. 
As director of the NLS, over her nearly dec-
ade of leadership, Karen has doubled the col-
lection of talking books and magazines while 
reducing production time for reading materials. 
She has opened up new worlds for all NLS 
patrons by ushering in the creation of mobile 
apps for downloading books and magazines in 
audio and braille, as well as advocating that 
the United States be a party to the Marrakesh 
Treaty, which provides for the exchange of ac-
cessible-format books across international bor-
ders. Her mission to ensure ‘‘that all may 
read’’ was all the more realized through her in-
strumental involvement in the launch of braille 
eReader device pilot programs to both in-
crease the speed of getting materials to pa-
trons and reduce storage and delivery require-
ments for materials for librarians. 
Beyond the collection, Karen has played the 
lead role in the renovation of the NLS satellite 
office building and the adoption of a new, 
modernized name for NLS reflecting its serv-
ice to not only blind Americans, but to the 
larger print disabled community. She ushered 
in a new era of NLS service and restructured 
the organization to better align with the mis-
sion of the Library to provide access for all the 
American people. 
This year, the NLS celebrated its 90th Anni-
versary. It is due to dedicated servants of the 
American people, like Karen, that we owe our 
thanks for a successful and influential program 
that touches American lives every day.

IN HONOR OF INDIANA CIVIL 
RIGHTS ICON, HURLEY GOODALL 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
in remembrance of Hurley Goodall, former In-
diana State legislator, civil rights icon, and one 
of the founding members of the Indiana 
Democratic African American Caucus, who 
passed away on May 12, 2021. 
Hurley was a lifelong resident of Indiana, 
who spent his life dedicated to community 
service and fighting for the rights of others. He 
was a graduate of Muncie Central High School 
before serving two years in the United States 
Army. 
As Muncie’s first African-American firefighter 
in 1958, Hurley began to forge a trail for 
young African-Americans. Hurley continued to 
serve his community, as the first African- 
American to be elected to the City of Muncie’s 
school board in 1970. He then served seven 
terms in the Indiana General Assembly, where 
he helped to establish the Indiana Black Leg-
islative Caucus. 
Hurley believed in setting an example for 
young men and women, and helping them 
succeed. He established a scholarship pro-
gram, with his wife, Fredine, to support up and 
coming leaders to continue their education at 
a local community college. 
Hurley is survived by his son Fredrick; his 
nephew, Robert; as well as his grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren. Today, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in remembering Hurley 
Goodall and honor his remarkable achieve-
ments throughout his full life.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
RICHARD ROHRMAN 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Richard Rohrman on his retire-
ment and thank him for his 26 years of dedi-
cated service to New Community Corporation. 
Mr. Rohrman has done tremendous work for 
Newark and my 10th Congressional District as 
CEO of one of our most important community 
development corporations. New Community 
Corporation was founded in Newark, New Jer-
sey in 1968 during a time of great civil unrest 
throughout the community. At the time, it pro-
vided 
local 
services 
from 
housing 
to 
healthcare to banking to help it rebuild after 
the Newark Rebellion. The mission of the cor-
poration is to ‘‘help residents of inner cities im-
prove the quality of their lives to reflect indi-
vidual, 
God-given 
dignity 
and 
personal 
achievement.’’ 
Mr. Rohrman has helped the corporation 
achieve its goals throughout his 26 years of 
working for the betterment of Newark resi-
dents. In his role as CEO, he has worked to 
provide $75 million in renovations to 1,100 
housing units for my district’s most vulnerable 
populations. He implemented a real estate de-
velopment plan to create more housing and 
ownership opportunities for moderate income 
families. Also, he developed and expanded 
programs 
to 
improve 
the 
health 
and 
healthcare options for underserved commu-
nities. 
He has many important achievements dur-
ing his time at the organization. He was re-
sponsible for the maintenance and security of 
charter schools, day care centers, a health 
care complex, and corporate offices for New 
Community. He managed a portfolio of small 
businesses, including an upscale restaurant, 
sandwich shop, health spa, print and copy 
center, food court, and grocery delivery serv-
ice. In addition, he supervised the final phases 
of renovation of St. Joseph Plaza, a historic, 
former church originally built in 1882 that now 
houses New Community’s corporate head-
quarters. Finally, Mr. Rohrman led a company- 
wide energy cost reduction initiative that saved 
the company more than $300,000 annually 
and a beautification program that involved 
landscaping more than 40 acres of company- 
managed property. 
Mr. Rohrman has been a strong advocate 
for the underprivileged and strong supporter of 
actions and initiatives to help our underserved 
communities. On behalf of the U.S. House of 
Representatives and the citizens of New Jer-
sey’s 10th Congressional District, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. 
Rohrman on his retirement and thank him for 
his many years of dedicated and honorable 
service.

HONORING MR. JERRY COOPER ON 
THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend Jerry Cooper on the 
occasion of his retirement after twenty years 
of service as the County Manager in Cherokee 
County, Georgia. 
Throughout his lengthy career in public 
service, Jerry has promoted fiscal responsi-
bility, ethical leadership, and superior service. 
Under his leadership as County Manager, 
Cherokee 
County 
has 
seen 
tremendous 
growth, transforming from a distant exurb of 
Atlanta into a thriving community to live, work, 
and play. In 2008, his leadership was put to 
the test as the ‘great recession’ upended small 
communities, like Cherokee County, across 
the country. Jerry met the emerging chal-
lenges with an unwavering resolve, and Cher-
okee County improved upon its pre-recession 
debt rating to an S&P AA+ rating at a time 
when many other communities were still reel-
ing from the crisis. He developed a profes-
sional code of ethics for public employees, en-
hanced local emergency services, and im-
proved public facilities, all while maintaining an 
estimated $106 million in tax savings for Cher-
okee County taxpayers over the course of his 
career. 
In addition to his role as County Manager, 
Jerry has served on the boards of the Malon 
D. Mimms Boys & Girls Club, Reinhardt Uni-
versity, the Rotary Club, and the Cherokee 
County Chamber of Commerce. He served as 
President of the Cherokee Child Advocacy 
Council, the Cherokee Educational Founda-
tion, and was awarded the Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Unity Award from Allen Temple Church. 
Prior to his career in public leadership, Jerry 
served in the United States Navy as a sub-
mariner aboard the U.S.S. Sam Rayburn. After 
traveling the world in service to our country, 
the Arkansas native returned home and ob-
tained a Masters of Public Administration from 
the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and 
Sciences at the University of Arkansas. Later 
he settled in Georgia, where he has spent 
much of his career life. He and his wife Sherry 
plan to enter this new phase of life, taking 
time to enjoy the community they have worked 
tirelessly to build over the past two decades. 
On behalf of the 11th District of Georgia, 
and the United States House of Representa-
tives, I earnestly congratulate Mr. Cooper on 
his retirement, and thank him for his years of 
public service.

the Library of Congress. She also was well 
loved for her time with Harvard University and 
the University of New Mexico, and received 
many awards in her career, including one from 
the U.S. Department of Energy for sustained 
superior service. 
Her time at the Library of Congress began 
in 2014 as lead of the Humanities and Social 
Sciences division and not long after, she be-
came the Deputy Librarian for Library Collec-
tions and Services, as well as the 25th Law Li-

she ‘‘led the Law Library of Congress during 
times of profound change and challenges,’’ 
and that she was a ‘‘visionary leader of the 
Law Library, whose profound contributions 
made the institution, and its links to the Amer-
ican people, stronger and more impactful.’’ Ac-
cording to another colleague, ‘‘numerous dig-
ital projects, webinars, LibGuides, and of 
course the Legal Research Institute will serve

gress, Dr. Carla Hayden, stated that Jane was 
a ‘‘remarkable colleague.’’ 
The legacy of Ms. Sa´nchez’s service to our 
Nation certainly reflects that. I wish to extend 
my greatest thanks to Ms. Sa´nchez for her 
decades of public service and express my 
deepest sympathies to her family and col-

INTRODUCING HOUSE RESOLUTION 
HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
CREATION 
OF 
WONDER BREAD IN INDIANAP-
OLIS, INDIANA 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a bill to honor the 100th anniversary 
of the creation of Wonder Bread at Taggert 
Baking Company in Indianapolis, Indiana. This 
bicameral and bipartisan resolution recognizes 
that this storied company, with deep Indiana 
roots and its iconic Wonder Bread product, 
made lasting impacts on American life and 
showcase the best of Hoosier values. 
With hard work and a pull-yourself-up-by- 
the-bootstraps story, the Taggart Brothers’ 
creation of Wonder Bread in Indianapolis 
jumpstarted an innovation in commercial bak-
ing that touched American lives from the Mid-
west heartlands to our nation’s coasts. Ameri-
cans from all walks of life know Wonder 
Bread, and just as many enjoyed childhood 
memories with this iconic product and lunch-
box favorite. 
Indianapolis has long been a haven for 
hard-working entrepreneurs with big ideas— 
from Madam CJ Walker to the current genera-
tion of visionaries. That Wonder Bread can 
tout Hoosier roots, is yet another example of 
our state’s industrial and entrepreneurial spirit. 
I am honored to join many of my House col-
leagues who represent Indiana and Senator 
BRAUN, on the Senate side, in celebrating this 
legacy through our resolution commemorating 
and honoring the 100th Anniversary of the cre-
ation of Wonder Bread. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this resolution. 
IN MEMORY OF MARY GREEN 
ROONEY 
HON. MICHELLE STEEL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, on April 30, 
2021, the people of Orange County, California 
lost a selfless member of their community and 
I have lost a dear friend with the passing of 
Mary Green Rooney of Newport Beach. 
Throughout her life, Mary epitomized the vir-
tues of service and compassion. From her 
time at the University of Southern California. 
to her work at Rutan & Tucker, to her con-
tribution teaching Sunday school at St. An-
drews Presbyterian Church, she always lifted 
up those around her. 
Mary will be deeply missed. She was a 
woman of great faith and sincere commitment 
to doing good for her community and the ones 
she loved so dearly. To her husband Peter, 
and her two sons Brett and J.B., who I know 
she was so very proud of, I extend my great-
est sympathy in this time of deep sorrow. I will 
keep Mary and her family in my prayers in the 
days to come.

THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC PREVEN-
TION AND BIOSECURITY ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Global Pan-
demic Prevention and Biosecurity Act, a bill 
that would create a diplomatic global effort to 
ban the sale of live and fresh wildlife for 
human consumption. This policy, and the au-
thorization of corresponding programs, would 
reduce risk and increase research of zoonotic 
diseases, support reduction of wildlife traf-
ficking, and expand programs that aim to 
close wildlife markets. 
This bill also authorizes programs to ad-
dress the demand for live and fresh wildlife for 
human consumption by improving nutritional 
choices and outcomes while protecting critical 
wildlife areas. 
A whole-of-government approach that em-
braces a One Health model is critical to ensur-
ing that we are much better prepared for an-
other zoonotic disease like COVID–19, that we 
understand its risks, and that we can mitigate 
spread from animals to humans. 
My legislation would create a Global 
Zoonotic Disease Task Force. It would also re-
quire a multi-sectoral strategy from USAID to 
reduce the demand for wildlife consumption 
through food security interventions, and au-
thorize an integrated zoonotic disease pro-
gram to research and conduct surveillance of 
priority and unknow diseases, and to prevent 
spillover through behavioral changes. 
I am thrilled to be joined in leading this bill 
with my colleague on the State and Foreign 
Operations 
House 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee, Congressman JEFF FORTENBERRY, 
and in the Senate with Senators CHRIS COONS 
and LINDSEY GRAHAM. I urge our colleagues 
on both sides of the chamber to help us pass 
this important measure.

COMMEMORATING THE 10TH ANNI-

DIVISION’S 
ARRIVAL 
TO 
EL 
PASO, TEXAS 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 10th anniversary of the 1st 
Armored Division’s arrival to El Paso, TX. 
Nicknamed the Old Ironsides, the 1st Ar-
mored Division was founded in 1940 at Fort 
Knox. They have valiantly protected our nation 
in the toughest battles—World War II, the Ko-
rean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Per-
sian Gulf War, and the conflicts in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. Old Ironsides have called many 
places home, including Fort Hood and West 
Germany. On May 13, 2011, they found their 
home at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. 
Over the last 10 years, America’s future 
military leaders are being trained at Fort Bliss 
and about 30,000 Iron Soldiers continue to ex-
ercise mission commands of the Army. The 
1st Armored division and their families have 
become integral members of our community— 
their presence at Fort Bliss supports our local 
economy and creates a richer and more di-
verse culture. 
I, and the rest of the El Paso community, 
are appreciative of the 1st Armored Division’s 
service to our country and are grateful for 
each of the Old Iron Soldiers for their sac-
rifices, service, and leadership. The El Paso, 
Texas community is proud to call the First Ar-
mored Division the home of America’s tank 
force.

event venues were. Although he was laid off 
early on amid the COVID–19 outbreak, John 
and his family were able to make ends meet 
with the help of direct economic impact pay-
ments and enhanced unemployment insurance 
made possible through the CARES Act and 
the American Rescue Plan. These relief life-
lines helped John and his wife keep up with 
their mortgage payments and meet out-of- 
pocket medical expenses. 
A diabetic and transplant recipient, John 
also understood that his medical history put 
him at higher risk for serious COVID–19 infec-
tion, and so he was careful to avoid close con-
tact with others outside of his immediate 
household. 
Now, over a year later, and several weeks 
since the enactment of the American Rescue 
Plan, John and his family are fully vaccinated 
against COVID–19, and he has been able to 
gather with his mother and sisters safely in 
person once again. Additionally, he has been 
able to make plans to safely reopen the 
Scranton Cultural Center’s doors and continue 
providing enriching experiences for North-
eastern Pennsylvanians of all ages. 
Throughout this past year, President Biden 
has often warned the world, ‘‘it has never, 
ever, been a good bet to bet against the 
American people.’’ He is right, and Americans 
like John are the people he has in mind when 
he boasts this sentiment. 
Although I regret being unable to have John 
accompany me in the House chamber in per-
son due to COVID–19 safety protocols in 
place at the time, I am humbled to uplift his 
comeback story. It is a shining example of 
American resilience and determination through 
the darkest of times. 
I recognize his story in honor of him, as well 
as all the Northeastern Pennsylvanians who 
suffered, sacrificed and persevered through 
this pandemic.

HONORING 
TOMMY 
STEVENSON 
AND 
36 
YEARS 
OF 
TOMMY’S 
COUNTRY HAM HOUSE 
HON. WILLIAM R. TIMMONS, IV 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. TIMMONS. Madam Speaker, I want to 
congratulate Tommy Stevenson on his retire-
ment after 36 years of service to our commu-
nity. His well-lived life, risk-taking, and hard 
work paid off, and he achieved the American 
Dream by establishing the single most iconic 
restaurant in Greenville. 
More than a restaurant, Tommy’s Country 
Ham House became the social and political 
heart of Greenville. There is a saying that ‘‘the 
road to the White House begins at the Ham 
House.’’ Over the years, generations of aspir-
ing politicians visited Tommy’s in the weeks 
leading up to South Carolina’s ‘‘First in the 
South’’ primary. The many signed pictures 
hanging on the restaurant ‘‘Wall of Fame’’ are 
a testament to the esteem in which he is held 
by generations of public servants and other lu-
minaries. 
His service to our community has also ex-
tended far beyond the political realm, whether 
it be feeding the Furman University football 
team before games or providing generous dis-
counts to our law enforcement community. I 
would also like to commend Tommy for em-
ploying individuals with intellectual disabilities 
or substance abuse problems, who are often 
forgotten by society when they need a hand. 
Tommy treated all of his employees with the 
same kindness and respect that he showed 
his own family, and he allowed my staff to es-
tablish an ‘‘unofficial’’ office at the Ham House 
to assist countless disabled veterans and wid-
owed constituents in obtaining much-needed 
Federal benefits. Tommy’s giving spirit is truly 
an inspiration to us all. 
Although Governor McMaster has already 
bestowed Tommy with the Order of the Pal-
metto, our community will never be able to 
fully thank him for the past 36 years of service 
to the people of Greenville and the Upstate as 
a whole. As this chapter of Tommy’s incredibly 
successful business career closes, my wish is 
that another, equally fulfilling chapter with his 
wonderful family opens. May God continue to 
bless him and his.

SAFE DRINKING WATER IN PUBLIC 
PLAYGROUNDS, PARKS, AND LI-
BRARIES ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, l rise today 
with a call to action regarding the right to 
clean drinking water. Clean drinking water is 
not a luxury; it is a fundamental human right 
that should be accessible to all regardless of 
your socioeconomic status. 
There are over 30,000 public playgrounds 
and parks in major U.S. cities and approxi-
mately 17,000 public library locations today. 
Children and students frequently congregate in 
those places for learning, borrowing a book, or 
having fun. But neither they—nor their par-
ents—should have to worry that the drinking 
water may be unsafe. 
That is why, today, I am introducing the 
Safe Drinking Water in Playgrounds, Parks, 
and Libraries Act. This bill would ensure 
states, municipalities, and libraries have the fi-
nancial resources to replace drinking water 
fountains, monitor them, or replace the Lead 
Service Line connected to such fountains. 
While we can test water fountains for lead poi-
soning, some municipalities, schools, and li-
braries lack the resources to replace their 
water fountains; this is simply wrong. My bill 
will ensure such entities have the necessary fi-
nancial resources to accomplish this task. 
Exposure to lead—even low levels—can 
have serious health and development con-
sequences for infants, children under six, and 
pregnant women. For those exposed to this 
dangerous element, signs of poisoning may in-
clude cognitive impairment, behavioral prob-
lems, and other health related problems. Ac-
cording to the American Academy of Pediat-
rics, ‘‘there is no safe amount of lead expo-
sure in children . . .,’’ which is why it is critical 
that we advance efforts that prevents lead poi-
soning. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Safe Drinking Water in Public 
Playgrounds, Parks, and Libraries Act. It is un-
deniable that the fate of our children and fu-
ture generations rests on the decisions we 
make today on access to clean water. Let’s 
ensure all enjoy this fundamental human right.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
DAVE RAPALLO 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
service of Dave Rapallo, Staff Director of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
For the last decade, Dave has skillfully guid-

Committee with his incomparable mastery of 
strategy, oversight, and detail. 
Few individuals have impacted this body as 
greatly as Dave. Countless Members of Con-
gress have sought his counsel and come 
away more effective for it. Hundreds of staff 
learned the art of Congressional oversight and 
how to use the tools of Congress to demand 
answers on behalf of the American people. 
Dave previously served as Chief Investiga-
tive Counsel under Chairman Henry Waxman. 
He led critical investigations exposing wartime 
contracting fraud in Iraq, the outing of CIA 
agent Valerie Plame, steroid abuse in major 
league baseball, and the causes of the 2008 
financial crisis. 
Dave served as General Counsel on the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, and 
then was appointed by President Barack 
Obama as Senior Director on the National Se-
curity Council staff. 
In 2011, Dave answered the call of the late 
Chairman Elijah Cummings, who asked Dave 
to serve as his staff director on the Oversight 
Committee. I know Chairman Cummings trust-
ed Dave more than anyone to help make our 
government more efficient and more effective. 
When I took over following the tragic death 
of Chairman Cummings, Dave helped ensure 
the Committee had a seamless transition. 
Dave has never sought the spotlight but in-
stead uses his talents to make those around 
him shine. 
He demands excellence and gives nothing 
less himself. Dave worked harder than anyone 
I know, always thinking two steps ahead and 
finding the best route to get there. 
More than anything, he is a dedicated public 
servant committed to using the powers of 
Congress to make a difference. 
During 
the 
last 
Administration, 
Dave 
oversaw the Committee’s efforts to ensure 
every person in America was counted in the 
Census, every American could exercise the 
right to vote, and every child separated from 
their parents at the border was reunited. 
For all of this and so much more, we say 
thanks to Dave Rapallo. He has made a last-
ing impact on this body and this country.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER AMBER 
HOMA 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Amber 
Homa for her 15 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Homa has worked throughout her 
career to serve the people of Somerset Coun-
ty. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank her for her work to pro-
tect life and property in our community and 
wish her continued health, safety, and suc-
cess.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. STANLEY 
YOUNG LOUIE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Dr. Stanley Young 
Louie, affectionately known as the ‘‘Selma 
Doctor.’’ 
Dr. Louie provided healthcare to the com-
munity of Selma, California, for 22 years with 
the Logan Street Medical Group. Shortly after 
joining, he became the medical director and 
owner. Dr. Louie also served as the president 
of the Selma Healthcare District during his ca-
reer. 
Beloved by the Selma community, Dr. Louie 
was an active member of the Selma Rotary 
Club and Selma Chamber of Commerce, and 
he frequently contributed to the local news-
paper and participated in community events. 
Dr. Louie also proudly celebrated his Chinese 
culture, serving as a member and president of 
the Fresno Chinese Consolidated Benevolent 
Association and participating in Lunar New 
Year celebrations with the Chinese New Year 
program at the Confucius School of Fresno. 
Dr. Louie is remembered as a family man 
who enjoyed taking trips to the coast with his 
wife and daughters and was frequently in-
volved in his daughters’ extra-curricular activi-
ties. He is survived by his wife, Adriane; his 
parents, Sammy and Shirley; his daughters, 
Christina, Danielle, and Samantha; his brother, 
Stacey; his sister, Sherry; and many loving 
grandchildren, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, 
and cousins. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring Dr. Stan Louie, the ‘‘Selma Doctor,’’ as 
a flag is flown today over the United States 
Capitol in his memory.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ARTHUR B. COOK, JR. 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an individual from 
my hometown of Corona, California whose 
dedication and contributions to our nation are 
exceptional. On Saturday, May 29, 2021, re-
tired Lieutenant Colonel Arthur B. Cook, Jr. 
will serve as the 2021 Grand Marshal of the 
7th annual Memorial Mile March. The March is 
an event hosted by the Corona Chamber 
Foundation to honor our military and those 
who have proudly served our nation in uni-
form. 
Lt. Col. Cook proudly served in the United 
States Army for 27 years and 7 months. Early 
on in his career, Lt. Col. Cook held the honor 
of Platoon Leader of the Old Guard, the Army 
unit that performs the funeral services for Ar-
lington National Cemetery and guards the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. On the solemn 
evening when President John F. Kennedy’s 
body was brought to rest at Arlington National 
Cemetery, Lt. Col. Cook was on duty with the 
Old Guard. 
Later in his Army career, Lt. Col. Cook grad-
uated with distinction from The Infantry School 
and Officer Candidate School. During a tour of 
duty in Vietnam, Lt. Col. Cook was awarded 
the Silver Star and two Bronze Stars for valor 
in action. He also received the Meritorious 
Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, 
Army Achievement Medal, Presidential Unit 
Citation, Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gal-
lantry with Palm, and the Republic of Vietnam 
Civil Action Medal among many others. Upon 
returning from Vietnam he and his wife, 
Dickey, and daughter, Noelle, settled in Co-
rona. The Cooks have lived in the same home 
in Corona since 1969. 
In light of all that Lt. Col. Cook has done for 
our nation and community, it is only fitting to 
honor him as the Grand Marshal in the Memo-
rial Mile March. On behalf of everyone in the 
42nd Congressional District I want to thank Lt. 
Col. Cook for his service to our nation. I add 
my voice to the many who will be congratu-
lating Lt. Col. Cook for being selected as the 
2021 Memorial Mile March Grand Marshal.

HONORING PAMELA ANN WRIGHT 
FOR HER MANY YEARS OF SERV-
ICE TO SARATOGA COUNTY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Pamela Ann Wright for her 
many years of selfless service to Saratoga 
County. 
Born and raised in Galway, New York, Pam-
ela began her career as a Confidential Sec-

Clerks of Legislative Boards in 2012 and was

She also currently serves as the Administra-
tive Assistant to the Adirondack Association of 
Towns and Villages. After 11 years as the 
Clerk and 33 years total serving within the 
Saratoga County government, Pamela is em-
barking on her well-deserved retirement. She 
has been instrumental in the day-to-day oper-
ations of the Board of Supervisors, and her 
dedication and perseverance to her role 
helped ensure her community ran smoothly. 
In addition to her service in the county gov-
ernment, Pamela has also prioritized giving 
back to her community through community 
service. She currently serves as the President 
of the Hadley-Luzerne Lioness Club, an orga-
nization that works to raise awareness to local 
needs and pursues solutions through chari-
table works. She was awarded Lioness of the 
Month in October 2015 and March 2017. Addi-
tionally, she was awarded the Robert J. 
Uplinger Distinguished Service Award in June 
2017 for her faithful dedication to the commu-
nity and the Hadley-Luzerne Lioness Club.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MS. KAO 
LY ILEAN HER 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 20, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the life of 
Ms. Kao Ly Ilean Her, a Hmong-American 
leader and University of Minnesota Board of 
Regent who died on May 13 at age 52 of 
COVID–19. Ms. Her was a tremendous advo-
cate and a connector for our community and 
the State of Minnesota. Her passing is a loss 
that is felt deeply throughout Saint Paul and 
our state. 
A refugee who fled war-tom Laos as a 
young girl in 1976, Ms. Her and her family ar-
rived in the United States and eventually 
made Minnesota their new home. She ex-
celled at academics, graduating from Hamline 
University and earning her Juris Doctorate 
from the University of Minnesota Law School 
and becoming the first Hmong woman to be 
admitted to the Minnesota State Bar Associa-
tion. In 2019, she was the first Hmong-Amer-
ican elected to the University of Minnesota 
Board of Regents by the Minnesota Legisla-
ture. 
Ms. Her put her natural leadership skills to 
use for others early on—founding several non-
profit organizations, promoting the empower-
ment of women and girls and supporting our 
community in many other ways. She was es-
pecially dedicated to efforts supporting youth, 
respecting elders and advocating for the arts 
that enrich and sustain us. 
It was a privilege to work closely with Ms. 
Her throughout the time I’ve served in con-
gress, and to experience her energy and opti-
mism for building a bright future for herself 
and others. During her service as executive di-
rector of the Minnesota Council on Asian Pa-
cific Minnesotans in the early 2000s, she 
reached out to my office and volunteered to 
help lead the successful state efforts to reset-
tle Hmong refugees arriving from Thailand. 
Her work to help these new Americans transi-
tion to life here were invaluable as they recon-
nected with family members, established new 
homes and quickly contributed to the eco-
nomic and cultural vitality of our community. 
Ms. Her understood the innate importance 
of family and the power that neighbors have in 
working together for the common good. Her 
ability to connect community members and 
empower others has spurred new leaders in 
the Hmong-American community and through-
out our state. Her own path in life inspires a 
vision for others to believe in themselves and 
determine their own futures. 
My condolences are with Ms. Her’s beloved 
family and many friends. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in tribute to Kao Ly Ilean Her 
for her remarkable life of service and leader-
ship for others.
