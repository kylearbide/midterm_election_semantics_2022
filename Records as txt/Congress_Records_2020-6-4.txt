PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of love and mercy, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
Look toward us, O God, and have pity 
on us, for we are much afflicted. Pre-
serve our lives, and rescue us. Let us 
not be put to shame, for we take refuge 
in You. 
These are such troubling times, with 
Americans on all sides striving for a 
great reckoning and readjustment of 
our norms and habits of society. It is 
frightening for many; painful for all. 
For our leaders, local and national, 
enlighten them with the wisdom and 
courage to address injustice where it 
resides. 
Comfort Your people and help us all 
to grow in faith, hope, and love. 
Bless us all this day and every day, 
and may all that we do and can do for 
our neighbors be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

Article I, Section 8, Clause 7 of the United

shall be so construed as to Prejudice any

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, in these difficult and 
challenging times, remind us that the 
Earth belongs to You, and You have 
not abandoned it. Unite us with the un-
derstanding that You are our Father, 
and we are all members of the human 
family. We pray for all who have been 
impacted by the pain of this crisis sea-
son. Use our Senators to make the 
weak strong, the sick healthy, and the 
broken whole. Lord, surround those 
who have been shaken by anguish with 
Your divine presence and peace. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, June 4, 2020. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable CINDY HYDE-SMITH, a 
Senator from the State of Mississippi, to per-
form the duties of the Chair.

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH thereupon as-
sumed the Chair as Acting President 
pro tempore.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday evening, the Senate passed a 
few targeted changes so that Senator 
COLLINS’ and Senator RUBIO’s historic 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
will 
continue to protect American workers 
and small businesses through this pan-
demic. 
Back in March, these Senate leaders 
hand designed this plan to push unprec-
edented assistance to working families 
and 
Main 
Street 
businesses. 
Once 
again, in April, they led the charge to 
refill their popular and successful pro-
gram with more money so it could help 
even more Americans. In the weeks 
since, our colleagues have continued to 
track the program’s operation and rec-
ommend further tweaks where nec-
essary. 
In recent days, both Senator COLLINS 
and Senator RUBIO helped to strength-
en and improve the House’s proposed 
PPP modifications before it actually 
passed the bill and sent it over to us, 
and I know the senior Senators from 
Maine and Florida have already identi-
fied several more technical fixes for 
the new legislation that, I hope, Con-
gress will address. 
Talk about legislation making a dif-
ference. Thanks to Senator COLLINS, 
Chairman RUBIO, and our other col-
leagues who helped to make this pro-
gram a success, the PPP has delivered 
more than a half a trillion dollars in 
relief and has literally saved tens of 
millions of American jobs. 
So, as we continue to stay nimble 
and continue our efforts, I just had to 
thank and recognize the architects of 
this historic program—the senior Sen-
ators from Maine and Florida—for 
helping to soften the blow of this pan-
demic for so many American families. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, today 
marks the 31st anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre in Bei-
jing. 
Because of China’s censorship and 
disinformation, we still do not know 
how many brave Chinese people were 
killed by their own government on 
June 4, 1989. Conservative estimates 
say hundreds. Others say thousands—a 
burst of violence against peaceful de-
mocracy protesters, weeks of arrests, 
roundups, and executions, and then 
total silence. 
Never since have the Chinese people 
been able to freely and openly remem-
ber the atrocity. Never outside the 
oasis of Hong Kong has a single formal 
gathering on Chinese soil been per-
mitted to commemorate the victims. 
Now even that oasis of freedom is at 
risk. We learned this week that, under 
new pressure from Beijing, Hong Kong 
is refusing to permit the annual can-
dlelight vigil for the first time ever. 
This year, the Chinese Communist 
Party wants no candles lit even in 
Hong Kong—just more darkness. 
It was 31 years ago that brave Chi-
nese flooded that public square and 
others across their nation in the fer-
vent hope that economic liberalization 
would also lead to a less authoritarian, 
more open society. What they got were 
bodies littering the ground. 
A shocked world sanctioned the PRC, 
but as time passed, the world relaxed 
somewhat and returned to a strategy of 
welcoming China into our global public 
square, bringing the PRC into inter-
national institutions in the hope that 
an included China would actually play 
by the rules. Time and again, those

hopes have been dashed. The last few 
months have been their own tidy case 
study in what kind of global actor the 
so-called People’s Republic has chosen 
to be. 
Their response to the coronavirus 
pandemic that started in their own 
country was to silence their own doc-
tors, imprison their own people, shut 
down important research, and lie to 
the rest of the world while hoarding 
supplies for themselves. The CCP’s self-
ishness and failures fueled a worldwide 
catastrophe, and, ever since, they have 
tried to use that catastrophe as a 
smokescreen for other aggression. 
While they thought the rest of the 
world 
was 
distracted, 
China 
has 
cracked down on Hong Kong; conducted 
provocative military exercises near 
Taiwan; expanded its bullying into the 
South China Sea; pressured the Phil-
ippines; and literally initiated physical 
fighting with India in the Himalayas. 
Oh, and according to press reports, 
China has also found the time to 
mount 
online 
disinformation 
cam-
paigns to hurt America and divide us 
among ourselves. Bad actors linked to 
Beijing have reportedly flooded Twit-
ter to exploit the death of George 
Floyd and increase hostility among 
Americans. Even in official channels, 
CCP leaders mock America and imply 
our society is no better than their tyr-
anny. 
Now, as an aside, some Democrats 
here in Washington seem to have swal-
lowed the Chinese propaganda and set 
out to amplify it themselves, including 
from right here on the Senate floor. 
Yesterday, right here in the Senate 
Chamber, the Democratic leader ex-
plicitly compared America men and 
women in uniform to the Chinese mur-
derers who committed the massacre in 
Tiananmen Square. Leader SCHUMER 
said that, when he saw images of Amer-
ican men and women in uniform stand-
ing near the recently defaced Lincoln 
Memorial and protecting the right to 
peaceful protest, ‘‘You cannot help but 
think of Tiananmen Square.’’ That is 
what he said. 
I am sure Beijing was thrilled with 
this shameful comparison. A propa-
ganda victory for Communist China, 
gift-wrapped with the compliments of 
the Democratic Party, delivered just in 
time for this bloody anniversary. 
Imagine being so consumed by par-
tisanship that you deliberately link 
the brave American men and women 
who stop violence, protect peaceful 
protests, 
defend 
citizens’ 
constitu-
tional liberties, and defend against vio-
lent riots to the Chinese butchers who 
gunned down crowds of peaceful dis-
senters who were begging for the same 
rights our military defends. 
In America, the police help peaceful 
marchers march. Over there, they gun 
them down. If anyone is having trouble 
distinguishing these things, the prob-
lem is not with our Nation—it is with 
them. 
Now, these recent examples of Chi-
nese hostility are just symptoms of a 
fundamental problem that has come 
into focus. Decades ago, the United 
States and the rest of the world made 
a calculated bet that welcoming China 
into the fold would cause it to mend its 
ways. 
It was 20 years ago that President 
Clinton argued for admitting China 
into the WTO because ‘‘economic inno-
vation and political empowerment . . . 
will inevitably go hand in hand.’’ Many 
smart people made that wager—in both 
parties—but we should never have used 
words like ‘‘inevitable.’’ 
President Clinton also said: ‘‘China 
has been trying to crack down on the 
internet. . . . Good luck!’’ Back in the 
year 2000, the transcript says, that was 
greeted with laughter. Well, no one is 
laughing now. 
China’s leaders have pounced on 
every inch of economic space the world 
has afforded them—and then some. 
They have cheated on trade and have 
stolen foreign technology. They have 
executed on long-term plans to domi-
nate key global industries. They have 
weaponized foreign aid to bring devel-
oping countries under their thrall. So 
the Chinese economy has leapt for-
ward. The Chinese people enjoy greater 
prosperity, which they sorely need 
after 
decades 
of 
Communist 
mis-
management, but all of this money and 
innovation have not brought the people 
any more freedom. They have given 
CCP elites better high-tech tools with 
which to oppress their own people and 
more leverage with which to under-
mine the international system. 
Rather than importing liberty into 
China, this economic integration seems 
to have been rather more successful at 
exporting its authoritarian preferences 
to the rest of us. Right here in the 
United States, we have seen Hollywood 
make a gross habit of self-censoring 
films to avoid offending the Chinese 
Communist Party. We have seen the 
NBA prioritize its profits in China and 
throw an employee under the bus who 
spoke out for Hong Kong. The same 
elites, institutions, and businesses that 
feel totally free to critique our own so-
ciety—and 
rightly 
so—increasingly 
walk on eggshells around President Xi 
and his cronies. 
And free speech is hardly the only 
front where China poses an inter-
national threat. A recent major report 
from an interagency task force found 
that China’s deliberate economic ag-
gression and targeting of our industrial 
base is a significant national security 
vulnerability for the United States, 
and many other nations are awakening 
to that same reality. 
Back in March, a CCP-controlled 
newspaper threatened to cut off phar-
maceutical 
exports 
to 
the 
United 
States and ‘‘plunge’’ Americans ‘‘into 
the mighty sea of coronavirus’’ if we 
did not play more nicely with Beijing. 
One month later, Chinese officials 
threatened a boycott of Australia be-
cause our Australian friends wanted to 
investigate the origins of the pan-
demic. 
Earlier this year, the Director of the 
FBI explained that China’s criminal 
conspiracies against the United States 
and our companies make the CCP the 
‘‘greatest long-term threat’’ to Amer-
ica’s information security, intellectual 
property, and, by extension, our ‘‘eco-
nomic vitality.’’ Once again, our allies 
and partners are being victimized by 
the very same tactics. 
One outside report found that the 
‘‘United States is losing between $400 
billion and $600 billion per year in in-
tellectual property theft as a matter of 
provable losses, and that figure does 
not account for second-order losses 
such as jobs and infrastructure.’’ Let’s 
put that in perspective. Congress has 
been working hard on the huge, his-
toric Paycheck Protection Program. It 
has pushed out a half a trillion dollars 
for American workers. Well, by this es-
timate, China reaches into our country 
and steals the equivalent of that entire 
program every single year. 
China does not play by the rules, not 
in Hong Kong, not in the WHO, not in 
the WTO, not in international trade. 
Year after year, on issue over issue, it 
has chosen the path of aggression. So 
there will be consequences. 
Just this week, the U.K. is reportedly 
continuing to back away from plans to 
work with Huawei, and Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson is impressively pre-
paring 
to 
offer 
visas 
so 
that 
Hongkongers who want to know their 
freedoms and liberties are secure can 
take refuge in the United Kingdom in-
stead. In Japan, Prime Minister Abe is 
taking 
major 
steps 
to 
strengthen 
Japan and check China’s economic ag-
gression. It is a good thing, too, be-
cause defending American security, 
American interests, American pros-
perity, and the international system 
cannot be a go-it-alone operation. 
There will be steps the United States 
will take on our own, but just as the 
entire free world stands united today 
to remember Tiananmen Square, so we 
will need to stand together to prevent 
the world’s public square from heading 
toward a similar domination by China. 
We will need to keep our friends and 
partners close. China can try to repress 
its own people, but the United States 
of America will never fall silent. We 
will never go dark. We will keep the 
candles lit. We will protect our people 
and their bright future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2703 
June 4, 2020 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Michael Pack, 
of Maryland, to be Chief Executive Of-
ficer of the Broadcasting Board of Gov-
ernors for the term of three years. 
(New Position) 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a 
short time ago, in conjunction with the 
memorial service being held today in 
Minnesota for George Floyd, I joined 
the rest of the Democratic caucus in 
Emancipation Hall to recognize a mo-
ment of silence in honor of his memory 
as well as the memory of Breonna Tay-
lor, Ahmaud Aubery, and the unimagi-
nable number of Black Americans who 
have had their lives ended in police 
custody. 
Standing before the statue of Fred-
erick Douglass, a Black American who 
fought his whole life for a measure of 
racial equality, the moment of silence 
lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the 
length of time that the White police of-
ficer in Minneapolis pressed his knee 
on George Floyd’s neck. Standing there 
in silence, you feel the horrifying 
length of George Floyd’s final 9 min-
utes. You cannot help but imagine his 
horror and fear, knowing that his trau-
ma and the trauma of his family and 
his friends has been felt by so many 
Black families and Black communities 
across the country and across the cen-
turies. 
Of course, a moment of silence, a mo-
ment of solidarity, is no substitute for 
real action. That is why Senate Demo-
crats are working with our House col-
leagues on policing reform legislation. 
That is why we are demanding that 
the Republican majority leader com-
mit to addressing this issue on the 
floor of the Senate. 
Leader MCCONNELL, why don’t you 
admit that we have to do something 
here and not just say: Well, maybe we 
will take a look at it, as you did on gun 
control after the violent shootings and 
then did nothing? Make a commitment 
here and now to the American people 
that we will put on the floor—that you 
will put on the floor police reform and 
racial justice legislation this month. 
Will our Republican colleagues ever 
join us in this effort? I know these 
issues aren’t easy, but we can’t begin 
to make progress if the Republican 
leader and the Republican majority 
will not even let us try or address these 
issues in a legislative manner. 
The Republican leader has said: 
The coin of the realm in the Senate is floor 
time. What are you going to devote time to? 
Well, it has been 5 weeks since Lead-
er MCCONNELL called the Senate back 
into session during the height of a pan-
demic. The Republican majority has 
yet to put a single bill on the floor of 
the Senate related to COVID–19. 
We passed a much needed extension 
of PPP reform last night, a very pop-
ular and bipartisan program, only after 
Democrats forced action here on the 
floor. I don’t believe our Republican 
majority would have done anything. 
We announced we would UC the bill, 
and we did, and it was blocked. Then, 
of course, faced with the public pres-
sure of moving, Leader MCCONNELL 
came on the floor late last evening and 
moved the bill. 
Make no mistake about it, without 
the pressure that we Democrats placed 
on the Republican majority to make 
these changes, it would certainly have 
been further delayed and might never 
have happened. 
Now, Leader MCCONNELL
has said 
that another emergency relief bill was 
likely before July 4, but then on Tues-
day, when listing his priorities for the 
June session, Leader MCCONNELL did 
not mention COVID legislation. 
Republican Senators are starting to 
say that another relief bill might— 
might—come in late July—shocking. 
This past week—just today it was an-
nounced—nearly 2 million more Ameri-
cans filed for unemployment, bringing 
the total since the start of the pan-
demic to over 42 million. 
The monthly jobs report tomorrow is 
expected to report over 20 percent un-
employment, and we should wait? As 
people are losing their jobs, as parents 
are not sure they can feed their kids or 
stay in their homes, as small busi-
nesses, where people put their blood, 
sweat, and tears over the years and 
even decades to build them are col-
lapsing—and we should wait? Why? Be-
cause 
maybe 
some 
rightwing 
ideologues or some of the very big lead-
ers of the Republican Party and bene-
factors don’t like spending money on 
anything? 
I don’t know if that is the reason. I 
hope it isn’t. But we can’t wait. We 
can’t wait. 
The economic disaster, as with so 
many issues in society, will dispropor-
tionately affect Black Americans. So 
far, 109,000 fellow Americans have died. 
More are dying every day, every single 
day, but Senate Republicans want to 
wait until late July to maybe—maybe 
do another relief bill. 
The coin of the realm in the Senate 
is floor time. Leader MCCONNELL, every 
Senate Republican, what are you going 
to devote time to? 
Today, toward the end of one of the 
more tumultuous and painful weeks in 
recent memory, marked by emotional 
protests about racial justice and police 
violence, Senate Republicans are hold-
ing sessions in the Judiciary and 
Homeland Security Committees re-
lated to President Trump’s favorite 
conspiracy theories about the 2016 elec-
tion. 
I am not making this up. That is 
what they are doing, American peo-
ple—not talking about COVID, not 
talking about racial justice but focus-
ing on some Russian-originated theory 
that has been discredited by our intel-
ligence agencies. That is what the Re-
publican Senate is doing. No wonder 
they are in trouble. 
The American people are looking for 
some kind of real help, some kind of 
real discussion, and the Republicans 
are talking about conspiracy theories. 
Then the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee is about to approve another 
rightwing judge, a McConnell protege, 
Justin Walker—seriously. At least, if 
you look at the record and history of 
Justin Walker, the chances of him 
being for strengthening voting rights 
and antidiscrimination legislation is 
very, very tiny. Yet they move forward 
on him. 
By the end of the day, the two Repub-
lican-led committees will have ap-
proved up to 100 subpoenas—unprece-
dented in modern history. In the midst 
of national crises, Senate Republicans 
are trying to use the Senate to do op-
position research for the President’s 
reelection campaign. Seriously? 
The Republican majority will ap-
prove up to 100 subpoenas to chase the 
President’s wild conspiracy theories 
but has not put one bill on jobs, one 
bill on testing, one bill on employment 
on the floor of the Senate since Leader 
MCCONNELL called us back. They will 
not even commit to a debate on law en-
forcement reform. 
You might think that an economic 
crisis, a public health emergency, on 
top of the searing reminder of racial in-
justice, might have put the conspiracy 
caucus on pause, but no—no such luck. 
The American people should call 
their 
Republican 
Senators. 
They 
should demand action. The Republican 
Senate is failing to meet this impor-
tant moment, and the Republican 
President isn’t doing any better. 
In a week marred by unacceptable vi-
olence and rioting in some places, the 
President advocates more violence, 
more chaos, more disorder, including 
appalling attacks on the constitutional 
rights of protesters on his front porch. 
I am heartbroken by stories of peace-
ful protesters being injured when the 
protests turn ugly. I am heartbroken 
by reports of police officers who are 
doing their job the right way, striving 
to keep the peace, who have been 
gravely injured.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2704 
June 4, 2020 
Three of New York’s finest were in-
jured yesterday while assigned to pre-
vent looting. A New York State troop-
er in Buffalo was run over the other 
night. I wish New York State Trooper 
Ron Ensminger and the Buffalo police 
officers injured in these disturbing in-
cidents a speedy and full recovery and 
thank them for their service and com-
mitment to public safety. 
Let me state, once again, unequivo-
cally, that the cause of justice and 
change sought by protesters in and be-
yond is undermined by lawlessness and 
violence. President Trump, however, 
seems to be incapable of acknowl-
edging the fact that the overwhelming 
number of peace protesters are peace-
ful and are simply advocating change. 
He seems incapable of turning the tem-
perature down to prevent more vio-
lence. Quite the opposite. The Presi-
dent wants Americans to falsely be-
lieve that all the people who are pro-
testing for a good cause—equality and 
racial justice—are violent. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. The 
overwhelming majority are doing what 
our Founding Fathers did: protesting 
to make this Nation a better nation. 
They should be praised, not vilified. 
In a week marred by unacceptable vi-
olence and rioting in some places, the 
President advocates chaos and dis-
order, including appalling attacks on 
constitutional 
rights 
on 
his 
front 
porch. My goodness. My goodness. 
Earlier 
this 
week, 
Americans 
watched Federal officers, under the di-
rection of the President and the Attor-
ney General, use gas and rubber bullets 
to disperse a crowd of peaceful pro-
testers in the park. The Lincoln Memo-
rial was blocked off by rows of camou-
flaged officers. 
There are reports right now that 
troops from Fort Drum and Fort Bragg 
are camped outside Washington, DC. I 
would ask the leaders of our military, 
if these reports are true, what are they 
doing there, and what are their orders? 
The leader, a few minutes ago, men-
tioned Tiananmen Square. Of course, 
no one believes that we are China or 
like China—of course not. We are a de-
mocracy, and we are proud of it. Most 
of us love and praise the right for 
peaceful protests. But I would remind 
the Republican leader, when any Presi-
dent, particularly an overreaching one 
like this, steps over the line, if good 
people don’t raise their voices, that is 
the way to erode democracy, which 
China does not have. 
Where is Leader MCCONNELL’s voice? 
Instead of spinning these crazy theo-
ries, why doesn’t he just speak out 
against what the President did Monday 
night? Why did he block our resolution, 
our simple resolution, which called for 
only three things: one, praise the pro-
testers; two, condemn violence; and, 
three, condemn the President for what 
he did? 
Our Nation’s Capital is being pa-
trolled by Federal officers commanded 
by President Trump and Attorney Gen-
eral Barr, who refuse to identify who 
they are and where they come from. 
What is President Trump doing to 
this democracy, to the rule of law, to 
the primacy of the Constitution? And 
where 
are 
the 
Republican 
Senate 
voices—Leader MCCONNELL and every-
one else here—condemning what he 
did? 
Again, democracy will be eroded if we 
don’t stand up for it, if we are afraid to 
speak out, afraid to tell President 
Trump he is overreaching and has done 
bad, bad things when he does them. 
I am not the only one who feels this 
way. We have had statement after 
statement from Americans of all polit-
ical stripes. I read George Will, for in-
stance, the other day. He is a conserv-
ative, but he cares about America, and 
he has got some principle. 
Then, the most remarkable of all, 
issued by President Trump’s former 
Secretary of Defense. I want to read 
some of what former Secretary Mattis 
said: 
When I joined the military, some 50 years 
ago, I swore an oath to support and defend 
the Constitution. Never did I dream that 
troops taking that same oath would be or-
dered under any circumstance to violate the 
constitutional rights of their fellow citi-
zens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op 
for the elected commander-in-chief, with 
military leadership standing alongside. We 
know that we are better than the abuse of 
executive authority that we witnessed in La-
fayette Square. 
Mattis continues: 
Donald Trump is the first president in my 
lifetime who does not try to unite the Amer-
ican people—does not even pretend to try. 
Instead he tries to divide us. We are wit-
nessing the consequences of three years of 
this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the 
consequences of three years without mature 
leadership. We can unite without him, draw-
ing on the strengths inherent in our civil so-
ciety. This will not be easy, as the past few 
days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow 
citizens; to past generations that bled to de-
fend our promise; and to our children. 
That was President Trump’s former 
Secretary of Defense, James Mattis. 
Like all former members of the mili-
tary, I know that Secretary Mattis 
strives to avoid political statements. 
He has assiduously avoided them so 
far. But it was a searing indictment of 
President Trump’s failures that impor-
tuned Secretary Mattis to speak out so 
strongly about the President’s divisive-
ness, immaturity, and abuse of power. 
Make no mistake about it, General 
Mattis’s comments were a shot across 
the bow to our military leaders: Don’t 
let the President push you into doing 
things you know that are wrong, that 
should not be done, and that could very 
well violate the Constitution. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
South Dakota. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, respond-
ing to the coronavirus continues to be 
one of our top priorities here in Con-
gress, I think, as evidenced that yester-
day the Senate moved a bill across the 
floor of the Senate that will be on its 
way now to the President’s desk for his 
signature, previously passed by the 
House, that makes some modifications 
to the PPP program—things that were 
sought by both sides, improvements, I 
think, that enable that program to be 
used with greater flexibility, extending 
the amount of time in which those dol-
lars that have been received can be 
used, and allowing some greater flexi-
bility in how they are used. 
So I think that is evidence, again, 
that this body, and both Democrats 
and Republicans working together, can 
get things done for the American peo-
ple that address the very direct needs 
and challenges they face right now as a 
result of the coronavirus. 
I credit the authors of that—Sen-
ators COLLINS and RUBIO on our side, 
along with their Democratic counter-
parts—for working together to struc-
ture a program that has not only 
helped many businesses stay in busi-
ness—millions of businesses stay in 
business—but has kept tens of millions 
of people in this country employed at a 
time when we desperately need to keep 
those jobs. 
So, again, I think it is evidence of 
this body’s and our Senate majority’s 
focus on the coronavirus and things we 
can do to help assist those who have 
been most harmed economically by 
that, as well as addressing the very 
real health emergency that we need to 
continue to focus on in terms of finding 
those therapeutics and vaccines that 
will enable the American people to 
have confidence, once again, that they 
can go out. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. President, what I want to speak 
to today is the evidence that we are 
seeing that the economy around the 
country is starting to reopen. There is 
still a lot of work, obviously, that has 
to be done to defeat the virus and help 
our economy and the American people 
recover. 
As I mentioned, we have spent the 
past few weeks focused on monitoring 
the implementation of the $2.4 trillion 
in aid that Congress has provided. Our 
committees are hard at work con-
ducting 
coronavirus 
oversight 
and 
looking ahead to what else Congress 
may need to do to combat the virus 
and to get our economy going again. 
We are looking at what more funding 
Congress may need to provide and what 
Congress can do that doesn’t involve a 
lot of new spending. 
As I said, Congress has already pro-
vided 
$2.5 
trillion 
to 
fight 
the 
coronavirus, and we will absolutely 
provide more if needed, but we need to 
remember that every dollar we have 
provided is borrowed money that our 
children and grandchildren will have to 
repay. 
Our debt was already very large com-
pared to the size of our economy, even 
before—before this year’s coronavirus- 
related borrowing, and that is a very 
concerning reality. The truth is, we 
can’t just keep borrowing and bor-
rowing ever greater sums without suf-
fering real economic consequences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2705 
June 4, 2020 
So, while we may need to borrow 
more money to meet our needs before 
this crisis is over, it is crucial that we 
keep that borrowing as low as possible 
and only spend that which is abso-
lutely necessary. 
That is why the Senate is so focused 
on conducting oversight of the money 
we have already provided. Seeing how 
and where those funds are used will 
give us a better sense of where we 
spent sufficiently and where more 
money may be needed. 
We are also, as I said, looking at 
what we can do to help families and 
businesses that does not involve spend-
ing a lot of taxpayer dollars. While my 
friends across the aisle generally seem 
to regard money or a new government 
program as the solution to every prob-
lem, the truth is, there are a lot of 
things Congress can do without spend-
ing trillions of taxpayer dollars or set-
ting up new government bureaucracies, 
everything from making permanent re-
forms to make telehealth more acces-
sible to shielding responsible busi-
nesses from frivolous litigation. 
I have three tax bills that I have in-
troduced this Congress that would help 
Americans during and after the pan-
demic. One of these bills is my Mobile 
Workforce State Income Tax Sim-
plification Act, which I introduced last 
year along with Senator SHERROD 
BROWN. 
In our economy, substantial numbers 
of workers travel to different States 
for temporary work assignments on a 
regular basis, and they end up subject 
to a bewildering variety of State laws 
governing State income tax. 
Our legislation would simplify things 
for both workers and employers by cre-
ating an across-the-board tax standard 
for mobile employees who spend a 
short period of time working across 
State lines. It would ensure that States 
receive fair tax payments while mak-
ing life a lot easier for workers who 
travel to different States for work. 
While this legislation is good tax pol-
icy, generally—we have needed clear 
rules of the road for out-of-State work-
ers for a while—it has particular rel-
evance in the age of coronavirus. 
The Governor of New York has made 
it clear that he is looking to cash in on 
the pandemic by subjecting doctors and 
nurses who cross State lines to volun-
tarily work in New York to New York’s 
income tax. 
We need to make sure that medical 
professionals who traveled to other 
States to help fight the coronavirus 
aren’t rewarded with big tax bills. An-
other tax bill I introduced last year 
that has particular relevance in the 
age of coronavirus is my New Economy 
Works to Guarantee Independence and 
Growth Act. We always have an acro-
nym around here. It is called the NEW 
GIG Act. 
The last decade or so has seen the 
rise of the gig economy—services pro-
vided by individuals through apps and 
websites like Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, 
Instacart, Postmates, and many oth-
ers. A lot of us have relied on these 
workers during the pandemic to pro-
vide food and grocery delivery. But 
these 
gig 
economy 
arrangements 
stretch the boundaries of current tax 
law. 
During the pandemic, companies who 
have wanted to provide additional ben-
efits to workers—from personal protec-
tive equipment to financial assist-
ance—have hesitated to do so for fear 
that their actions would accidentally 
reclassify their workers from inde-
pendent 
contractors 
to 
employees. 
That would mean the end of this kind 
of work for a lot of people who rely on 
it for the income and flexibility it pro-
vides. 
My NEW GIG Act updates our tax 
law to provide clear guidance on the 
classification of this new generation of 
workers. It will ensure Lyft drivers, 
Postmates, Taskers, and others are 
treated as independent contractors for 
purposes of tax law if they meet a set 
of objective criteria. 
My bill will allow companies to pro-
vide support to workers to help them 
stay safe during the pandemic without 
jeopardizing these individuals’ status 
as independent contractors. And it will 
ensure that the valuable services these 
individual provide will remain avail-
able to the Americans who are increas-
ingly reliant on them. 
In addition to the NEW GIG Act, I 
also introduced the Digital Goods and 
Services Tax Fairness Act last month. 
This legislation, which I introduced 
with Senator WYDEN, is designed to 
prevent consumers from being faced 
with multiple taxes for downloading 
digital products. 
Over the past few months, I imagine 
a lot of Americans have purchased new 
books to read on their Kindle or a new 
television series to watch. But what 
many Americans don’t know is that, 
right now, a digital purchase of a book 
or 
television 
series 
could 
hypo-
thetically be taxed in up to three 
States, depending on the circumstances 
of the purchase. 
With States likely looking to find 
new revenue in the wake of declining 
receipts during the pandemic, there is 
a real danger that Americans could see 
multiple States’ worth of taxes on 
their digital purchases. The Digital 
Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act 
would provide ‘‘rules of the road’’ for 
taxing digital goods and services and 
ensure that digital purchases could be 
taxed in only one State—the State in 
which the consumer resides. 
It would also prohibit States and 
local governments from taxing digital 
goods at higher rates than tangible 
goods. In other words, under our bill, 
that season of ‘‘The Office’’ you want 
to buy digitally couldn’t be taxed at a 
higher rate than if you were pur-
chasing the season on DVD. 
These tax bills are just some of the 
ideas Republicans are putting forward 
that would help Americans without 
spending trillions of additional tax-
payer dollars. I am working on mul-
tiple other measures to help Americans 
in the wake of the coronavirus. For ex-
ample, the CARES Act, our largest 
coronavirus response bill to date, in-
cluded a temporary version of legisla-
tion I introduced with Senator WARNER 
that allows employers to contribute up 
to $5,250 tax-free to help pay down 
their employees’ student loans. 
This is a win for employees, who can 
receive help with burdensome loan pay-
ments during a time when multiple 
Americans’ finances are stretched thin. 
And it is a win for employers, who have 
a new benefit to offer to help attract 
talented employees as they seek to 
build their businesses back up after the 
past few months of COVID-related 
challenges. 
I am hoping that we can make this 
legislation permanent before the end of 
the year. As I said earlier, if we need to 
provide additional coronavirus funding, 
we will. But we need to make sure we 
are only providing what is genuinely 
necessary because today’s young work-
ers, 
and 
our 
children 
and 
grand-
children, will be paying the price for 
the debt we are amassing. 
I am committed to supporting legis-
lation that will help Americans get 
through this crisis while minimizing 
the burden on future generations. My 
tax bills are one example of this kind 
of legislation. I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues to advance 
them in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
REMEMBERING GEORGE FLOYD 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today after my col-
leagues have held a moment of silence 
for the passing of George Floyd. His 
family should not be preparing for his 
funeral today. All Americans, regard-
less of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, 
or sexual orientation, deserve to have 
equal protection under the law. 
It is time that we not just speak out 
about injustice; it is time that we pass 
new Federal laws to protect the civil 
liberties of U.S. citizens and protect 
them from these injustices. What is our 
role here in the U.S. Senate? I believe 
it comes to passing new laws for those 
Federal protections. 
The U.S. Attorney General is the top 
law enforcement of our country. He di-
rects and supervises U.S. attorneys 
that prosecute Federal crimes. 
The Attorney General is supposed to 
make sure that citizens in our country 
have equal protection of the law. He is 
supposed to uphold the Fourth Amend-
ment protections against unreasonable 
seizure and the Civil Rights Act, that 
protects against excessive use of force 
by police. 
It is not about calling out the mili-
tary. It is about protecting the civil 
liberties of our U.S. citizens. He is sup-
posed to enforce 18 U.S. Code Sec 242, 
which prohibits the deprivation of 
rights under the color of law. It crim-
inalizes abuse by police. 
The U.S. Department of Justice Civil 
Rights Division is supposed to step in

when police departments have serious 
abuses. The Civil Rights Division is re-
sponsible for enforcing Federal prohibi-
tions on patterns or practices of polic-
ing that violate the Constitution or 
other Federal laws. 
It conducts investigations of allega-
tions of systemic police misconduct 
and reaches comprehensive agreements 
on reforms that are needed to restore 
effective policing and trust with com-
munities. If it cannot reach an agree-
ment, the Division will bring a Federal 
lawsuit to compel the needed reforms. 
Yes, we have something to do here in 
Washington. 
Throughout U.S. history, the Civil 
Rights Division has played a major role 
in a number of critical cases, including 
the prosecution and murders of Medgar 
Evers and Dr. Martin Luther King. 
Yes, we have something to do here in 
Washington. 
The Obama administration made po-
licing reform a priority. The Civil 
Rights Division was active in helping 
oversee pattern and practices of police 
department abuses and entered numer-
ous consent decrees with Seattle, with 
New Orleans, on Ferguson, with Balti-
more, and with Cleveland. 
Why? Because we had cases that 
needed that Federal oversight. We saw 
that there were abuses of use of force 
across the country, including even in 
my home State, that we needed to ad-
dress. 
In 2006, Otto Zehm, a man with devel-
opmental disabilities, was wrongly ac-
cused of stealing money from an ATM. 
Mr. Zehm was improperly hog-tied by 
police, placed on his stomach, and he 
died from lack of oxygen to his brain. 
As he was dying, he said, ‘‘I was just on 
my way to get a Snicker bar.’’ 
It breaks my heart that somebody 
with disabilities was treated this way. 
There was a Federal indictment in this 
case and the police officer was found 
guilty of excessive use of force, lying 
to investigators about the confronta-
tion. As a result of a civil case, the 
Spokane police were required to re-
ceive special training on interaction 
with mentally ill suspects and detain-
ees. 
In 2010, John T. Williams, a Native 
American, 
a 
seventh-generation 
woodcarver who used his knife to make 
street art, was fatally shot seven times 
in the back by Seattle police. He had 
hearing difficulties and mental health 
challenges. Literally, he was just carv-
ing in one spot and decided to move 
across the street to another spot. When 
he didn’t respond to the officer, he was 
shot and killed. The officer who killed 
Mr. Williams wasn’t charged, but the 
U.S. Department of Justice did inves-
tigate and found that there was a pat-
tern and practice of abuse by Seattle 
police. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and 
Seattle agreed on a consent decree, 
which required a number of reforms. 
And now, just recently, an African 
American named Manuel Ellis died 
from respiratory arrest due to physical 
restraint by a Tacoma police officer. 
This just happened in March of 2020. 
Meth and an enlarged heart contrib-
uted to his death, but the Pierce Coun-
ty medical examiner ruled his death a 
homicide, and his case is under inves-
tigation. 
All of these issues in the State of 
Washington led our citizenry to have a 
debate about this. In 2018, 62 percent of 
Washington voters approved ballot ini-
tiative 940. It required de-escalation. It 
required training for police officers to 
understand how to help and deal with 
the public. It mandated first aid to a 
victim of deadly force, and it required 
an outside investigation into the use of 
that deadly force. 
It also removed the requirement that 
prosecutors prove malice to hold police 
officers criminally liable for use of 
deadly force. And that continues to 
need improvement in our state. 
These were steps in the right direc-
tion, but these events in the last sev-
eral weeks have showed us that it is 
not time to step back from this issue; 
it is time to pass new Federal legisla-
tion. 
Under the Trump administration and 
Attorney General Barr, the U.S. De-
partment of Justice Civil Rights Divi-
sion police practices group has been re-
duced to half. It has not opened a 
major 
pattern-or-practice 
investiga-
tion of police departments’ violation of 
civil and constitutional rights. Presi-
dent Trump and his administration 
have pulled back from Department of 
Justice’s important oversight role, at a 
time we can see that we need more of 
a Federal role, not less. 
In 
November 
2018, 
then-Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions changed the De-
partment of Justice policy to make it 
even harder for the Department to per-
form its oversight role of our police de-
partments. He made it harder for the 
Department of Justice to reach dissent 
decrees with State and city govern-
ments and limited the reforms that 
they could require. 
The Trump administration has shown 
that it isn’t interested in the commu-
nity 
policing 
programs 
that 
have 
shown success in the past. There are 
numbers that statistically show that 
better investment in community polic-
ing helps us lower the crime rate. 
In 2017, the Trump administration led 
the U.S. Department of Justice to sig-
nificantly scale back on the Obama-era 
program called Collaborative Reform 
Initiative, which provided support to 
improve trust between police and com-
munities. And under the Trump admin-
istration, it no longer strongly sup-
ports consent decrees, which have been 
so helpful in holding local cities and 
police departments accountable for 
civil rights abuses. 
The Trump administration tried to 
defund the Office of Community Polic-
ing and Services Program. Thank god 
our colleagues have refused that. This 
provides important Federal funding 
help hire community policing and offi-
cers and to provide technical assist-
ance. 
I think this stands in stark contrast 
to President Obama, who requested 
that the COPS program be funded each 
year in his budget request. 
But all of this brings us to where we 
are today. What the citizenry of the 
United States of America is telling us 
is that we need better laws on the 
books. I believe we need to act here. 
The death of George Floyd has shown 
us that there is a clarion call and a 
need for more Federal action. 
I believe in these things: I believe 
that we should have a prohibition on 
chokeholds and knee restraints that 
cut off oxygen to the brain. 
I believe that we should, just like the 
State of Washington, provide for more 
Federal support for de-escalation train-
ing. 
I believe in establishing a Federal 
standard for the use of body cameras, 
and when they should be mandatory, 
because I think they should be, and 
making sure that what happens to the 
video is available, and that the public 
knows and understands what is hap-
pening. 
I believe in requiring an independent 
investigation, just like we did under 
State statute—and by the way, that 
initiative that was voted on, with some 
of these provisions in them, in the 
State of Washington, and received 60- 
percent approval from the Washing-
tonians of our State. Why? Because 
they believe these things are essential. 
The Duckworth bill provides for a inde-
pendent 
investigation 
when 
deadly 
force has been used, and we should be 
making this the Federal law of the 
land. 
And we need to provide more support 
for community policing, and not just 
the dollars but accountability for when 
and how the dollars are used, so the 
community knows exactly what is 
going on with the Federal dollars for 
community policing. 
And we need to require the Attorney 
General and Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral, who lead the USDOJ Civil Rights 
Division, to vigorously identify and 
end patterns and practices of abuse in 
police departments and seek penalties 
for those who haven’t. 
I suggest a Federal audit every year 
where there are practices and patterns 
of abuse and give us the information so 
that we in Congress can also help in 
holding those accountable for not 
meeting the Federal standards of up-
holding citizenries’ civil rights. 
And we need to create a clear Federal 
standard on the use deadly force, just 
like the Washington State voters did 
when they passed legislation. Whether 
we do it like the Washington voters in 
ending the defense on malice, or wheth-
er we look at what my colleagues Sen-
ator BOOKER, HARRIS, and MARKEY have 
suggested, let’s have that debate. 
I am ready to say to my side of the 
aisle: Let’s get these issues—I men-
tioned seven of them—let’s get them 
out here. I am asking my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle: let’s engage on 
this Federal debate and show the citi-
zenry of America that we hear them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2707 
June 4, 2020 
Let’s not also just be deaf to the 
plight and fate that our officers are 
dealing with every day on the streets 
of America. We need more funding to 
help our police departments. We defi-
nitely, in some cases, need additional 
pay. But for this, we also need to deal 
with our housing crisis, our mental 
health crisis, our opioid addiction cri-
sis. So many of our men and women in 
blue are policing our streets not for 
crimes but for dealing with the popu-
lation that is living on the streets. We 
need to do better here than to short-
change them and to not help—not to 
help correct these situations that have 
now become day-to-day tasks in what 
has never been part of the law enforce-
ment effort. 
I ask my colleagues, let’s put our dif-
ferences aside to get real action on 
these. There is a Federal role on civil 
rights enforcement. Let’s take that 
role seriously, let’s respond to the 
death, and do something about it. I 
know that the best way to honor 
George Floyd today would be to help 
pass the laws that help protect the citi-
zenry of our State. We are a great 
country, and we can do better by meet-
ing this challenge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day the Senate Judiciary Committee 
held our first oversight hearing to 
learn more about the origins and evo-
lution of the counterintelligence inves-
tigation known as Crossfire Hurricane, 
opened in July of 2016 against a Presi-
dential candidate and his campaign 
team. I asked Rod Rosenstein, the 
former Deputy Attorney General, if he 
knew of a precedent for active FBI in-
vestigations against both nominees of 
the major political parties for Presi-
dential campaign, and he said: No, 
there is no precedent. 
The FBI is not supposed to be in-
volved in our elections and in our poli-
tics. Yet you recall what happened on 
July 5, 2016. Director James Comey 
held another unprecedented event—a 
press conference—at which he said that 
no reasonable prosecutor would pros-
ecute Secretary Hillary Clinton for a 
crime but then proceeded to detail de-
rogatory 
information—information 
that was not his to release but was sup-
posed to be part of a confidential inves-
tigation. 
Under our system of justice, the FBI 
is supposed to investigate crime, and 
then the Department of Justice makes 
the charging decision. That is when 
things become public. Yet, when the 
FBI decides there is not enough evi-
dence to support charging, it doesn’t 
hold a press conference and disparage 
the character and reputation of the 
person it is investigating. 
I 
don’t 
know 
whether 
Director 
Comey had an impact on the 2016 elec-
tion, but I do know what he did was 
wrong, and, yesterday, Deputy Attor-
ney General Rosenstein confirmed his 
memo to then-Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions, which was then attached to 
Jeff Sessions’ letter to the President, 
recommending that Director Comey be 
terminated as the FBI Director. The 
reason was not because he had made a 
mistake but because he had failed to 
see the error of his ways and was likely 
to repeat them again. 
The Deputy Attorney General is sup-
posed to be the supervisor for the FBI, 
and while the chain of command is 
pretty clear in criminal cases, in this 
species of investigation known as coun-
terintelligence, which is not primarily 
to investigate crimes but to inves-
tigate security threats to the United 
States, there was no chain of com-
mand. The FBI was running rogue 
under Director Comey, along with 
some of the things we have learned 
about with regard to Director McCabe, 
Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and others. 
It is really important that we not 
only make sure we understand what 
happened—that it was unprecedented 
and negatively affected Hillary Clin-
ton’s campaign—but that it also nega-
tively affected Donald Trump and his 
campaign, and this investigation con-
tinued long after he became President. 
It resulted in the appointment of a spe-
cial counsel, who ended up with no evi-
dence with which to charge the Presi-
dent with any crime. 
We can’t have the FBI interfering 
with our elections. Yes, it needs to in-
vestigate counterintelligence threats 
to the United States, and it needs to 
investigate crimes, but it should not be 
a primary actor in that process, in the 
public process, by which we elect Presi-
dents. It needs to stay in its particular 
lane and not become a partisan, in ef-
fect, affecting the outcome of Presi-
dential elections, all of which is to say 
that the investigation the Committee 
on the Judiciary began yesterday is 
very, very important. One thing we 
must make sure of is that this never 
happens again, and the only way we 
can make sure it never happens again 
is to make clear what did happen and 
where the train went off the rails. 
The last 31⁄2
years have been pri-
marily occupied with this so-called in-
vestigation into President Trump and 
his campaign, then the appointment of 
a special counsel, and 2 years of Direc-
tor Mueller’s investigation as special 
counsel. Then what followed that was 
impeachment. Think of all of the op-
portunity costs associated with that, 
the time we could have and should 
have spent on doing things which 
would have impacted the quality of life 
of the American people—improving ac-
cess to healthcare, creating economic 
opportunity, enhancing our national 
security. These are things we were not 
doing because we were preoccupied 
with these bogus investigations and 
the media leaks by the people who 
knew better. 
ADAM SCHIFF and the House Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence 
took a lot of sworn testimony during 
their ‘‘investigation.’’ Now that it has 
been declassified, we know that none of 
the witnesses—mainly Obama-era offi-
cials—knew of any evidence of coordi-
nation, cooperation, or collusion with 
Russian authorities—none of them. Yet 
ADAM SCHIFF and others on the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence had the temerity to go to the 
microphones and say there was ramp-
ant collusion, conspiracy, and collabo-
ration—just bald-faced lies. Of course, 
the American people didn’t know that. 
We didn’t know that because those al-
legations were reported in the press, 
and they led into this narrative which 
has so dominated us over the last 31⁄2 
years, only to find there was no basis 
for it. 
Suffice it to say that the investiga-
tions that are being conducted by the 
Committee on the Judiciary and by the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs, led by Chairman 
JOHNSON, I think, are very, very impor-
tant. The facts will come out. We know 
that Attorney General Barr has depu-
tized Mr. Durham, a U.S. attorney, to 
see 
whether 
there 
is 
evidence 
of 
chargeable crimes, because there needs 
to be accountability. 
AMERICA’S SPACE PROGRAM 
Mr. President, let me just on, maybe, 
on a happier note, talk about another 
event. We need a little good news, a lit-
tle hope, a little optimism in America 
these days. 
Last weekend, America’s space pro-
gram made history with the successful 
SpaceX crew Dragon launch. It was 
nearly a decade ago that American as-
tronauts in American rockets were 
launched into space from American 
soil. I mean, until last weekend, we 
were literally captives of the Russians 
in their providing the rockets or the 
rides we needed in order to get to the 
International Space Station. Yet that 
is not the only reason this launch was 
so significant. It marked the first time 
that our astronauts launched in a com-
mercially built and operated space-
craft. I must say that it looked pretty 
slick to me. 
As we work to ensure our country re-
mains a leader in human spaceflight, 
partnerships between the public and 
private sectors are going to continue to 
be very important. That is why NASA 
established a commercial crew pro-
gram to link the brilliant minds at 
NASA with those innovative companies 
like SpaceX, and this launch gave us 
just a glimpse into how those partner-
ships will lead us in the future. 
I remember the launch of the Apollo 
11 mission almost 51 years ago, and I 
remember seeing the photos of the as-
tronauts in the command module. They 
wore bulky space suits, and the sur-
rounding walls were completely cov-
ered with switches and dials and but-
tons. To be honest, not much changed 
over the next several decades. Even 
with the last launch on American soil

in 2011, the Space Shuttle Atlantis 
looked pretty similar. 
What America saw on Saturday was a 
glimpse into the future. Astronauts 
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley were 
outfitted in custom-designed and fitted 
space suits, and they were seated in 
front of a sleek touchscreen. It looked 
like the console of a Tesla, to me, but 
I am sure it was more sophisticated 
than that. 
After the two astronauts arrived at 
the 
International 
Space 
Station, 
Behnken referred to the Dragon as a 
slick vehicle. Yet things don’t just 
look like they were made for the fu-
ture, for they were designed to work 
better, last longer, and be safer. The 
Falcon 9 rocket was made with reus-
able parts to bring down the cost of 
human spaceflight. As we return Amer-
ican astronauts to the Moon and even-
tually to Mars, this commercial launch 
will have marked a new era of space ex-
ploration. It gives us hope and excite-
ment at a time when both of those are 
desperately needed. 
I thank and commend the countless 
men and women who have made this 
mission possible, especially my fellow 
Texans at Johnson Space Center—the 
center 
of 
human 
spaceflight 
for 
NASA—and then, of course, Elon Musk, 
who founded SpaceX. He said this 
launch was the result of, roughly, 
100,000 people’s efforts when you added 
up all of the suppliers and everybody 
involved. When you combine that with 
the work of the brave and brilliant as-
tronauts, physicists, engineers, mathe-
maticians, and scientists of all stripes 
who have helped us to have met our 
space exploration goals over the years, 
it is clear that America’s space pro-
gram’s best days are ahead. 
When the final NASA space shuttle 
crew departed the International Space 
Station in 2011, it left behind a small 
American flag with instructions that it 
be brought back to Earth by the next 
crew to be launched from the United 
States. Finally, almost a decade later, 
it has been united with the astronauts 
who will carry it home. 
On behalf of a proud nation, con-
gratulations 
to 
astronauts 
Bob 
Behnken and Doug Hurley, to everyone 
at the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, and SpaceX on suc-
cessfully capturing that flag. We wel-
come you home in the coming months 
so we can proudly say alongside of you: 
Mission finally accomplished. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that my remarks

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL PACK 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to oppose the nomination of Mi-
chael Pack to be the Chief Executive 
Officer of the U.S. Agency for Global 
Media. Yet, before I get into the spe-
cifics of the Pack nomination, I need to 
say a few words about the moment we 
are in and how we got here. 
We are facing two devastating crises. 
Over 100,000 Americans have died from 
COVID–19 in just a matter of months, 
and that number continues to grow. 
The scale and the speed of the tragedy 
is almost impossible to comprehend. 
We certainly stand with all of our fam-
ilies who have lost loved ones, and we 
cherish their memories. Unlike COVID– 
19, the second crisis is one of our own 
making. 
Over centuries of injustice, African 
Americans and other people of color 
have not been treated like human 
beings; they have not been treated like 
every American deserves to be treated, 
like every person in the world has the 
right to be treated. No. All too often, 
they have been treated like George 
Floyd, with a knee on the neck as they 
gasp and choke ‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ As a 
result, our country has erupted with 
protests. In this moment, these griev-
ances have been met with the petty an-
tics and deplorable, violent tactics of 
notorious dictators around the world. 
I am shaking in having to say this. I 
am shaken to the core that President 
Trump, with the assistance of his At-
torney General, used violence against 
peaceful protesters—people exercising 
their First Amendment rights—all for 
a photo op with a Bible. That is not 
right. It is not acceptable, and that is 
not America. 
This body has to act. We have to act 
quickly and effectively to address 
these twin crises. The moment calls for 
leadership at every level. We all know 
this, but we are not doing it. Why not? 
The answer is that President Trump 
and the Republican majority of this 
body are focused elsewhere while our 
country 
is 
suffering—perhaps 
like 
never before. They are focused on do-
mestic political errands. Yet, while 
trivial, these errands are corrosive to 
this body, to our country, and to the 
Constitution. 
I need to say a few words about what 
is and what is not happening in the 
Committee on Foreign Relations, be-
cause it bears directly on how and why 
Michael Pack is getting a vote on the 
Senate floor today. 
The Committee on Foreign Relations 
has helped to shape our collective re-
sponse to some of the country’s great-
est challenges—from Vietnam to Sep-
tember 11, to Afghanistan. We ought to 
be rising to the challenges of our time 
and shaping the international response 
to COVID–19. Yet, tragically, we have 
not held one public hearing on COVID, 
and the committee has not debated or 
voted on a single COVID-related bill or 
amendment despite our being months 
into the crisis. I know the Democratic 
members of the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations came together and 
offered a bill as part of an effort to be 
bipartisan so as to begin to address the 
crisis, because we understand that vi-
ruses and diseases know no borders. 
For as long as anyone can remember, 
until its current chairman, the com-
mittee has operated pursuant to what 
is known as comity. While that sounds 
like a fancy word, it simply means that 
we have found a way to work together 
to achieve a process that has worked 
for all members—the majority and mi-
nority alike—even if we haven’t always 
agreed on the substance. Had the chair-
man engaged to our condition of com-
ity, we would have almost certainly 
had a business meeting that would 
have focused on COVID, which is the 
crisis at hand, and not Mr. Pack—a 
blatantly flawed nominee. I know that 
‘‘comity’’ sounds awfully quaint in the 
polarized times in which we live, but it 
has worked. It has worked for the 
members, for the committee, and for 
the country. It has been the force that 
has bound us together, the force by 
which we have found common ground 
to advance the national interest. 
I am sad to report that the Michael 
Pack nomination was the nail in the 
coffin for comity. The chairman ig-
nored the requests of every member of 
the committee’s minority—a simple re-
quest: Let’s not vote on Michael Pack 
until we have collectively worked 
through all of the serious background 
problems that exist. The letter that 
was sent to the chairman did not even 
get responded to prior to ramming 
Pack through the committee. That si-
lence and the actions that have been 
taken have changed the committee 
and, I believe, the Senate for the worse. 
I don’t have the time or the inclina-
tion to go through every violation of 
the rules and norms that marred the 
committee’s process on Michael Pack, 
but there is one violation that I have 
to speak to, one that is so serious and 
so corrosive that it needs to be docu-
mented and should never be repeated. I 
am speaking about the chairman’s re-
fusal to allow a video stream live of the 
committee’s debate and vote on Mr. 
Pack. Yes, the chairman intentionally 
deprived the public of its opportunity 
to watch this unfortunate episode un-
fold as it did. This was shameful. It 
violated the rules. It sent the wrong 
message to every American and every 
person around the world. 
This committee is a beacon of light 
to the world for those who are op-
pressed, for transparency, for open gov-
ernment, for the rule of law, for a free 
press. Well, we shut out the Nation and 
the world for the first time in my years 
of being on the committee. Since I got 
to the Senate, I have been on the com-
mittee. I am the longest serving mem-
ber of the committee from either side 
of the aisle. Never have we done that. 
This is a message that we are weak, a 
message that we are ashamed, a mes-
sage that has no place in our democ-
racy. 
Now let me turn to Mr. Pack. 
If confirmed, Mr. Pack will oversee 
the Voice of America, Radio Free Eu-
rope/Radio Liberty, Radio Television 
Marti, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle 
East Broadcasting Networks. It is ab-
solutely critical that any person in 
this position maintain a strong firewall

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2709 
June 4, 2020 
between the work of its networks and 
grantees and political interference or 
influence from the White House or any 
others. People around the world have 
come to view the products from all of 
the networks and grantees as being re-
liable and trustworthy news sources. 
As this pandemic has highlighted, 
people crave reliable, independent, and 
credible journalism. The networks of 
the USAGM are sometimes the only 
independent journalism a country can 
rely on to bring free and open media to 
closed societies. In the past, the agency 
has made some serious missteps and 
the board and the agency’s head have 
historically worked with Congress to 
help to address them. 
Sadly, the debate over Mr. Pack has 
not even ripened to a discussion of his 
substantive qualifications. No. We are 
stuck dealing with the nominee’s seri-
ous background problems despite there 
being multiple efforts to engage Chair-
man RISCH, the White House, and Mr. 
Pack himself on these matters. The 
central issue with Mr. Pack is the way 
that he used—perhaps abused—his non-
profit organization, Public Media Lab, 
and his refusal to come clean about it. 
As you can see from this chart, Mr. 
Pack is the president of both the Pub-
lic Media Lab and his for-profit com-
pany, 
Manifold 
Productions, 
LLC, 
which he owns. It is where Gina Pack, 
his wife, is the vice president and sole 
other employee. Mr. Pack created and 
controls both organizations. Since cre-
ating Public Media Lab in 2008, Mr. 
Pack has used it to raise more than $4 
million 
from 
private 
foundations. 
Some of those grants were earmarked 
to make specific films while others, 
like a $250,000 grant from the Charles 
Koch Foundation, were simply for 
‘‘general operating support’’ for Public 
Media Lab. 
As you can see from this next chart, 
Mr. Pack transferred 100 percent—100 
percent—of 
the 
tax-exempt 
grant 
money Public Media Lab received to 
his for-profit company Manifold. No 
grants were given to any other organi-
zation—none. The IRS would probably 
call that operating a nonprofit for pri-
vate benefit, but I will get to that in a 
minute. 
Some of that grant money was used 
to make films, but based on Mr. Pack’s 
financial disclosures, it is possible that 
up to 75 percent of it—millions of dol-
lars—went straight to Mr. Pack and his 
wife Gina. 
What you see on this chart, as was 
suggested in the debate the other day, 
is not normal. It is not normal. This is 
not the standard. This is not how it is 
done in the industry. That is why the 
Office of the Attorney General for the 
District of Columbia, where Public 
Media Lab is incorporated, is now in-
vestigating Mr. Pack’s nonprofit for 
possibly breaking the law. The ques-
tion they are asking is whether Mr. 
Pack used donations to the nonprofit 
for his own enrichment—to line his 
own pockets. 
From my understanding, this kind of 
behavior would normally raise some 
yellow flags at the IRS as well and 
they would be curious as to why a non-
profit seemed to be operating for the 
sole benefit of its creator, but the yel-
low flag never went up at the IRS be-
cause, for many years after he created 
Public Media Lab, Mr. Pack never dis-
closed that it was doing business with 
his company—with himself. 
The IRS asks nonprofits two key 
questions to determine whether a situ-
ation of private benefit might exist, 
and for many, many years, Mr. Pack 
falsely told the IRS there was no rela-
tionship. When the IRS asked Mr. 
Pack, under penalty of perjury, wheth-
er Public Media Lab provided grants to 
any entity controlled by an officer of 
the nonprofit, he said no, year after 
year. But the true answer was yes. The 
IRS also asked Mr. Pack, again, under 
penalty of perjury, whether Public 
Media Lab conducted business with any 
entity that it shared officers or direc-
tors with. Again and again, year after 
year, Mr. Pack said no, but the true 
answer was yes. 
Had Mr. Pack told the IRS the truth, 
he would have had to make additional 
disclosures that might have raised that 
yellow flag, but the IRS was left in the 
dark by Mr. Pack’s false statements. 
When the committee confronted Mr. 
Pack last year with these false state-
ments, he claimed they were ‘‘over-
sights’’ and that he did not need to 
amend his filings because his false 
statements were unintentional, but 
then he turned around and made false 
statements to the committee about his 
taxes. 
Unfortunately, given the false state-
ments to the IRS year after year and 
then to the committee, we have to be 
concerned that Mr. Pack has a problem 
with the truth. Mr. Pack needs to come 
clean with the Senate, and he needs to 
come clean with the IRS. He needs to 
tell the IRS what is on this chart, how 
much grant money he transferred from 
Public Media Lab to Manifold, and that 
he sent it from himself to himself. 
So let’s review what we have learned 
from these charts. First, Mr. Pack may 
have conducted unlawful expenditures 
with his nonprofit and operated it for 
private gain. Second, the IRS and the 
Senate don’t know the full truth be-
cause Mr. Pack has made false state-
ments and refused to provide docu-
mentation. Third, Mr. Pack’s nonprofit 
is now under investigation by the Of-
fice of the Attorney General for the 
District of Columbia for the very issues 
that I have been seeking answers from 
him for 9 months—9 months. 
As my friend Senator MURPHY sol-
emnly noted yesterday, nominees need 
to tell the truth to Congress and the 
executive branch, and if there has been 
a mistake, the nominee needs to fix it. 
These are the basic requirements for 
all nominees who come before the Sen-
ate and the absolute minimum stand-
ard we used to ask them to meet. 
We live in an era where the extraor-
dinary quickly becomes routine, but 
even by that metric, Mr. Pack’s path 
to this floor has been a disgrace. If ad-
vice and consent means anything, at 
rock bottom, it means ensuring that 
the people we confirm are suitable for 
public service; and if they are not, we 
should not move forward. 
I am aware of the pressure that some 
of my colleagues face as a result of this 
nomination. I know that the President 
has publicly trashed Voice of America, 
calling it ‘‘the voice of the Soviet 
Union,’’ which I hasten to say is dan-
gerous nonsense. And I know that the 
President has spoken both publicly and 
privately of his intense desire to con-
firm Mr. Pack, come what may. But 
the objections I have raised today and 
have been raising for months are not 
political or partisan in nature. They go 
to the most basic and critical question: 
Is Michael Pack fit to serve? Should he 
be confirmed while he is under inves-
tigation and after having been dis-
honest with the Senate and the IRS? 
Given his alleged use of a small non-
profit for self-enrichment, can we trust 
that he will not use the massive re-
sources of the U.S. Government to line 
his own pockets? 
Colleagues, I implore you to consider 
these questions. Please put aside what-
ever pressure, whatever threats the 
President has made, and consider the 
dangerous precedent we are setting 
here today. If Mr. Pack is confirmed, 
the new bar for advice and consent is 
set below that of a nominee who is 
under open investigation by law en-
forcement and who blatantly provided 
Congress and the executive branch 
false information. 
This institution has been called the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. The 
history of this body guides us, and we 
make our decisions not just based on 
the immediate needs of the President 
but on the example we will set for the 
future. I ask my colleagues who may be 
inclined to support Mr. Pack’s nomina-
tion today, are you comfortable with 
this precedent? The answer should be 
obvious, and I pray that this body has 
the courage to get there. Let us turn 
away from Michael Pack, and let us 
focus on healing the wounds of our Na-
tion and our democracy. 
With that, I yield the floor.

TIANANMEN SQUARE 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
today is the 31st anniversary of the 
Tiananmen 
Square 
massacre, 
when 
thousands of peaceful students asking 
for their freedom were gunned down by 
Chinese Communist tanks and troops. 
Because of Beijing’s relentless censor-
ship and control over information, we 
never learned the true death toll of 
that dark day, but it is certain that 
thousands of peaceful protesters were 
murdered in the streets. 
Beijing’s savagery was exposed dur-
ing that massacre, reminding the West 
that 
this 
was 
the 
same, 
unreconstructed 
Communist 
Party 
that killed millions—tens of millions— 
of its own people without batting an 
eye in Mao’s Cultural Revolution and 
Great Leap Forward. A tiger never 
changes its stripes. 
Now the Chinese Communist Party is 
threatening another atrocity in Hong 
Kong, a city whose traditions and free-
doms it once promised to respect—but 
that it, secretly and increasingly open-
ly, loathes as a gleaming repudiation of 
Chinese Communism. 
Last year, an extradition bill that 
could have allowed Hong Kong resi-
dents to be ‘‘disappeared’’ to mainland 
China sparked mass protests. Hong 
Kong residents flooded the streets to 
display their disapproval and protect 
their freedoms. 
These are not anarchists trying to 
tear down the law—as the Chinese 
Communist Party’s shrill organs false-
ly claim—but they were free citizens 
fighting to preserve the rule of law 
they love so much, against a Com-
munist power that knows no law above 
itself. They are fighting for the very 
same freedoms we enjoy in the United 
States: the freedom of religion, speech, 
and assembly; private property; the 
rule of law. 
The Hong Kong protesters won the 
battle over the extradition bill, but the 
war for Hongkongers’ freedom isn’t 
over. While the world has been dis-
tracted by the coronavirus pandemic 
and other upheavals, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has seized the oppor-
tunity 
to 
finally 
enact 
what 
it 
euphemistically calls a national secu-
rity law but what is, in reality, an at-
tempt to extinguish Hong Kong free-
dom—a law that will allow Beijing’s 
agents to take broad action against 
Hong Kong residents, including those 
who protested against the extradition 
bill last year. 
Seven million residents of Hong Kong 
now face the very real possibility of 
losing their freedom and possibly their 
lives. Political dissidents risk being 
jailed arbitrarily—or worse. Hundreds 
of thousands of Christians, Muslims, 
Buddhists, Sikhs, and other religious 
minorities risk being driven under-
ground like their brethren on the Chi-
nese mainland—or perhaps put in a 
gulag of concentration camps like the 
Uighurs in China’s Xinjiang Province. 
The free world cannot stand by while 
the Chinese Communist Party sets fire 
to the venerable laws and freedoms of 
Hong Kong. Already the administra-
tion is moving to revoke Hong Kong’s 
special trade status, which has allowed 
Chinese Communist Mandarins to get 
rich off a free economic system while 
denying those very freedoms for more 
than 1 billion of their subjects on the 
mainland. 
And our great ally, the United King-
dom, has announced it will extend 
visas to 3 million Hongkongers—many 
of whom took part in last year’s pro- 
democracy protests so that they can 
escape the Chinese Communist Party. I 
highly commend Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson for striking this bold blow for 
freedom, but the United States can 
also do more. 
Today, I call upon the administration 
to prioritize the admission of per-
secuted Hongkongers to the United 
States through the U.S. Refugee Ad-
missions 
Program. 
In 
coordination 
with our allies, this action could save 
these brave Hongkongers from a hor-
rific fate under authoritarian Com-
munist rule. 
While this refugee program has been 
abused in recent years, it has always 
served the noble purpose of allowing 
those who are truly oppressed by their 
governments to immigrate safely to 
the free world. Now it can be used 
again in this worthy cause to help 
noble Hongkongers flee the grasp of the 
Chinese Communist Party before it is 
too late. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
REMEMBERING CODY HOLTE 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor Grand Forks Police 
Officer Cody Holte, who died in the line 
of duty last Wednesday. Both Senator 
CRAMER and myself are here. We at-
tended the funeral. It was truly a mov-
ing event. Today, we are here to honor 
him on the Senate floor as well and 
honor his service and honor his life. 
Officer Holte is a Hendrum, MN, na-
tive, a 2010 graduate of Norman County 
West High School, and a 2015 graduate 
of Minnesota State University Moor-
head, with a degree in criminal justice 
and minors in Sociology and military 
science. 
Officer Holte led a life of service, 
dedicating himself to serving his com-
munity, State, and nation by always 
putting the people he served first. Not 
only was Officer Holte an exceptional 
police officer, he also served as a first 
lieutenant in the North Dakota Army 
National Guard. For 10 years, I was 
Governor in North Dakota, and I can’t 
tell you how much we relied then and, 
of course, how much we rely now on 
our National Guard. As you can see, 
Cody was a first lieutenant in the Na-
tional Guard, and he did a fabulous job. 
Here he is in his guard uniform and, of 
course, his incredible service as a po-
lice officer in Grand Forks. 
Lieutenant Holte enlisted in the 
Army Reserve in 2010, and in 2015 he 
was commissioned into the North Da-
kota Army National Guard. He was last 
assigned to the 815th Engineer Com-
pany out of Lisbon, ND, where he 
served as a detachment commander, 
preparing his unit for upcoming mis-
sions. 
As an officer in Grand Forks and a 
first lieutenant in the North Dakota 
National Guard, Officer Holte served 
our Nation on multiple fronts. Through 
his 
leadership, 
courage, 
and 
work

ethic, he displayed the very best the 
State of North Dakota has to offer 
while also helping to ensure our safety 
and security. 
You realize how important it is today 
not only here at home but abroad. Here 
is somebody who served in both capac-
ities. What a life of service. 
My wife Mikey and I extend our deep-
est condolences to the Holte family— 
especially his wife Amanda, his son 
Gunnar, his parents Bret and Tracy, 
sister Alexis, and twin brother Brady, 
who is also a police officer and also 
served in the military. He served with 
the 
regular 
Army—Cody’s 
brother 
Brady—and now Brady serves with the 
Fargo PD. Here you have these twin 
brothers, both serving in the military, 
both serving as police officers, one in 
Grand Forks and one in Fargo. They 
were very close, as you can imagine. 
Last Wednesday, North Dakota lost 
one of its finest. Because of this, we 
must always honor his memory, in 
part, by supporting those who continue 
to serve as he did and never forgetting 
the burden his loved ones bear on our 
behalf. They sacrifice too. 
With that, I want to yield the floor 
to Senator CRAMER, who had the good 
fortune to know the family personally 
and had a long relationship with the 
family. I welcome and look forward to 
his remarks about Cody Holte, some-
body who is truly an exceptional per-
son and whose life epitomized service. 
And we pray for God’s blessing on him 
and on his entire family. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague Senator HOEVEN, 
and I associate myself with everything 
he said about Officer Holte. He is right. 
It was an appropriate celebration of Of-
ficer Holte’s life on Tuesday of this 
week as we attended the funeral, along 
with Congressman ARMSTRONG, Gov-
ernor 
Burgum, 
Adjutant 
General 
Gorman, and a whole bunch of other 
friends, family, members of law en-
forcement, community leaders, and 
even strangers who came to provide 
that heroes celebration that Cody 
earned. 
An interesting thing about what 
Cody went into, he and a fellow officer 
from the Grand Forks Police Depart-
ment were called to a scene where 
shots had already been fired and the 
deputy sheriff had already been hit by 
somebody who was simply being served 
an eviction notice, assigned by a 
judge—somebody who was very well 
armed with an AK–47. He had shot 41 
rounds before doing the damage that he 
had done and before he was stopped. 
When Cody arrived, like all good offi-
cers do, he didn’t run from the fire but 
ran to it. He saved lives by giving up 
his own. It is what heroes do. It is what 
all of our men and women in law en-
forcement who wear the badge are pre-
pared to do. 
We live in an interesting time. It was 
ironic, to say the least, that we in 
North Dakota, along the Red River, 
Grand Forks, are just up the interstate 
from Minneapolis, paying tribute to a 
hero, and yet that hero doesn’t seem to 
get the same attention that a criminal 
gets. That hero and his brothers and 
sisters who wear the badge don’t seem 
to be as respected by our media as 
criminals are. In fact, the restrictions 
and the restraint that our heroes exer-
cise in carrying out their duties, the 
vast majority of them, are really rare-
ly, if ever, highlighted. 
Yet we celebrate the life of Cody 
Holte—29 years old, the father of a 10- 
month-old 
son 
and 
a 
husband 
to 
Mandy. It is just really important that 
we stand in this Chamber today and 
give Cody the respect and the honor 
that he earned here in these hallowed 
halls and tell his story to a nation that 
is intrigued and fixated, in many re-
spects, on those that Cody protects us 
from. 
It was a great honor to be there with 
his family and with hundreds—thou-
sands, perhaps—of other law enforce-
ment officers to pay tribute to a real 
hero. I think it is important to note 
that this hero is also a real person. I 
thought that his chief of police gave an 
absolutely marvelous speech, and I 
want to just reiterate a couple of 
things that the Grand Forks chief of 
police said about Cody at the funeral. 
Chief Mark Nelson said that he and 
Cody had formed a close bond—by 
what?—in part, by sharing baby photos, 
the chief’s of his grandchild and Cody’s 
of Gunnar, his son. He recalled that 
Cody was a friend to all. Now, who 
doesn’t want a cop who is a friend to 
all and with a grin that could brighten 
anyone’s day? More importantly, he 
said that Cody was a cop’s cop, whose 
heart was bigger than his courage and 
who had passion and an unwavering 
dedication for protecting and serving 
his community. He said, when Holte 
was on duty, there was never any need 
to worry. 
So we pay tribute today to this hero, 
but we are reminded that he was also a 
husband to Mandy and a father to 
Gunnar. He was a son to Bret and 
Tracy. I know Bret and Tracy very 
well. I have known Bret nearly all of 
my life. He was a brother to Brady and 
Alexis, as Senator HOEVEN said. Brady 
is his twin brother and a police officer 
in Fargo, which is just an hour down 
the interstate from Grand Forks. 
Bret and Tracy are raising heroes, 
but, today, they are mourning the 
death of a son. I know something of 
that, as you know. It has been an inter-
esting experience for Kris and me to 
share our journey, after the loss of our 
son a couple of years ago, with Bret 
and Tracy. I want them to know how 
very, very much we love them and 
that, in the valley they are in, as deep 
as it is, they are not in it alone. 
Just as King David walked through 
the Valley of the Shadow of Death with 
the confidence that God was with him, 
they, too, can do that but that, in addi-
tion to God, there are a whole bunch of 
other people who are holding them up 
in prayer, who have their backs, with 
love, hugs, and whatever is needed and 
that, likewise, Mandy, as the wife of a 
fallen hero, has all of the brothers and 
sisters who wear the badge as part of 
her extended family. It is an incredible 
group. In addition to being a hero, 
Cody was these things, these very per-
sonal things. 
I thought the eulogy that was pro-
vided by his uncle, Anthony Carter, 
was exceptional. Anthony reminded us, 
as did other speakers but particularly 
Anthony, that when Cody swore an 
oath 3 years ago, he said, in protecting 
the city of Grand Forks, he likely 
knew there would be challenging days, 
which is why he wore a medallion 
around his neck that bore his favorite 
Bible verse, Philippians 4:13: ‘‘I can do 
all things through Christ, who gives me 
strength.’’ 
Cody has left—because somebody left 
for him—a legacy of faith. I know that 
to be true. I know that to be true be-
cause I know the Holtes so well. In 
fact, his Grandpa Pete was in my very 
first TV ad for Congress in 1996. It was 
a losing cause, but Pete was in the ad. 
His Grandma Sue was my mom’s very 
best friend. They were prayer partners. 
They did Bible study together. They 
ministered together. They might have 
gossiped a little, but they were for-
given. Sue and Pete left for Bret and 
his sisters a legacy of faith, and Bret 
and Tracy left for Cody and Brady and 
Alexis a legacy of faith. It is that leg-
acy of faith in a risen Lord and in a Fa-
ther who knows the grief of losing a 
Son, who died for freedom, too, you 
see. That faith is what sustains them 
today. 
It is really important that we as na-
tional leaders, as community leaders, 
as local leaders, and as family mem-
bers stand in this valley with the fam-
ily, and that is what we are doing 
today in addition to paying honor. 
Finally, to Cody’s brothers and sis-
ters who wear the badge, it seems like 
the world is upside down. It feels like 
the country is on fire. Yes, there is the 
occasional criminal police officer who 
does something really awful, and that 
person needs to be brought to justice, 
and, in Minnesota, that is happening. 
Yet the heroes far, far outnumber the 
criminals in our police officers. So I 
think it is important, as we pay tribute 
to a fallen hero, that those who are 
still out there protecting us, as we 
stand in this building and express our 
views, and who are standing in the gap 
throughout our country and through-
out our communities protecting the 
rights of people to assemble and ex-
press themselves peacefully that they 
know we are in their corner, that we 
have their backs, and that we honor 
them along with Cody today. We re-
spect them, and we hold them up be-
cause we love them—because we love 
them for what they do for us. I ask 
their forgiveness for taking them for 
granted and for not expressing the 
gratitude often enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2712 
June 4, 2020 
Cody’s short 29 years of life, with his 
last 3 years as a police officer and his 
several years as a member of the North 
Dakota National Guard—his testimony 
in his life and now in his death—re-
minds us to never take for granted our 
own safety and security. 
Say thank you to a police officer in 
honor of Cody, who I know is OK. I 
know that he is OK today. I hope he is 
with his Grandpa Pete and his Grand-
ma Sue somewhere. I hope that my 
Isaac, my son, bumps into him. We had 
a lake cabin right next door to the 
Holtes when those kids were growing 
up. So I stand with confidence that he 
is OK, but I continue to pray for those 
left behind, especially his family—espe-
cially his young son and beautiful wife 
and mom and dad and brother and sis-
ter—in that they, too, are confident 
that they will be OK but that, while we 
are in this valley, they are not alone. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
CARES ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as 
the ranking Democrat on the Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee of the U.S. Senate, I take this 
time to update my colleagues on the 
implementation of the CARES Act. 
I think all of us know that the 
CARES Act contained major, new pro-
visions to help small businesses, and I 
was proud to be part of a bipartisan 
working group, with Senator RUBIO, 
Senator SHAHEEN, and Senator COL-
LINS, that helped to craft three new 
programs to help small businesses as a 
result of COVID–19. 
We recognize the importance of small 
businesses to our economy, to job 
growth, to innovation, but we also rec-
ognize that small businesses are more 
vulnerable to an economic downturn. 
They don’t have the resiliency. They 
don’t have the deep pockets. They 
don’t have the liquidity that larger 
companies have. If we are going to get 
our economy back on track, we have to 
preserve small businesses and their 
workforces. 
We 
suggested 
and 
the 
Congress 
passed three new programs to help 
small businesses—the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan Grant Program, and a 
loan forgiveness program for existing 
and new loans taken out under 7(a), 504, 
or microloans. 
We recognize that all three of these 
tools were important. They were not 
exclusive. They worked together. PPP 
provides help to keep payrolls to-
gether. It buys 8 weeks of payroll. The 
EIDL Loan Program provides working 
capital for small businesses. The grant 
program provides immediate cash, and 
the forgiveness program allows a busi-
ness to be able to get through these 
next 6 months without the burdens of 
having to pay their loans. All of that 
works together to keep small busi-
nesses viable in our community. 
Let me first talk about the Paycheck 
Protection Program because that has 
certainly gotten the most attention. It 
provided 8 weeks of payroll relief, plus 
other expenses, for small businesses in 
this country. It has been very, very 
popular. In fact, the original amount of 
money that we authorized for loans— 
about $349 billion—was quickly used 
up, and we authorized an additional 
$310 billion of loan authority. There 
have been 4.4 million loans issued 
under the PPP program for a total of 
$510 billion. These loans were issued 
rather quickly considering the stand-
ing up of a new program and the vol-
ume of interest. 
I acknowledge the hard work of the 
Small Business Administration and its 
workers, as well as of the Treasury, in 
standing up this program and getting 
the money out quickly to save many, 
many small businesses in our commu-
nities. 
When we passed the PPP program, we 
would have hoped that 8 weeks later 
our economy would have been in a posi-
tion in which small businesses, in large 
number, would not have needed addi-
tional help or that the program’s pa-
rameters would have been adequate. 
That was not the case. 
Yesterday, this Chamber acted in a 
responsible way with legislation that 
Senator RUBIO and I and others rec-
ommended, along with our House col-
leagues who had recommended this to 
our colleagues, that would give small 
businesses that have existing PPP 
loans the discretion to use those funds 
over a 24-week period rather than an 8- 
week period, recognizing that many of 
these businesses could not get up to 
full payroll during this 8-week period. 
We also gave greater flexibility on the 
allocation of the funds. 
Even with these changes, there have 
been major challenges in bringing for-
ward the PPP program. First and fore-
most, we found—as we had, unfortu-
nately, thought might happen—that 
the underserved and underbanked com-
munities would have a much more dif-
ficult time in getting access to 7(a) 
loans under the PPP program. Quite 
frankly, we put language in the CARES 
Act so that the SBA would give special 
attention 
to 
the 
underserved 
and 
underbanked communities. 
Quite frankly, the SBA did not follow 
our direction. The SBA’s IG said that 
the Small Business Administration did 
not fully align with the congressional 
intent to help the underserved and 
rural markets. So we responded. We re-
plenished the PPP funds, and we allo-
cated a certain amount of those funds 
directly to smaller lending institu-
tions, 
recognizing 
that 
they 
have 
greater contact with the underserved 
communities, and it did help. 
Now, at our request, the Treasury 
has allocated an additional $10 billion 
to the CDFIs, the community develop-
ment financial institutions, that have 
better ties to the underserved commu-
nity. Each one of these steps helped. 
Allocating funds to smaller lenders and 
allocating funds to the CDFI will help 
us get to minority small businesses. It 
will help us get to women-owned small 
businesses. It will help us get to vet-
eran-owned small businesses. It will 
help us get to the smaller of the small 
businesses. It will also help us get to 
rural small businesses, but we need to 
do more. 
That is why I have authored legisla-
tion with Senator BOOKER. We have put 
out a plan on what needs to be done 
through a discussion document, and it 
recognizes that we have to provide 
greater help for businesses in under-
served communities for startup capital, 
for 
technical 
training, 
and 
for 
mentorship. All that will help so that, 
when we come out of COVID–19 and 
when we have the next economic down-
turn, we will have the financial institu-
tions and knowledge in all of our com-
munities to be able to take advantage 
of the tools that we make available in 
a timely way. 
Yesterday, we had our first oversight 
hearing with regard to COVID–19 and 
the tools of the Small Business Admin-
istration. That hearing was outside of 
private sector witnesses. Next week, we 
will have the Secretary of the Treasury 
as well as the SBA Administrator be-
fore us. What we heard from one of our 
witnesses yesterday, Connie Evans, of 
the Association for Enterprise Oppor-
tunity, was about COVID–19. Its eco-
nomic consequences are projected to 
erase decades of minority enterprise 
growth in underserved markets. 
She continued: 
To prevent this, we believe policymakers 
must acknowledge the existing disparities in 
our small business ecosystem and take the 
necessary steps to create equitable legisla-
tion to ensure that vulnerable businesses 
survive and thrive in the years ahead. 
I couldn’t agree more. That is why 
Senator BOOKER and I have issued our 
discussion 
document 
that 
includes 
many ways in which we can bring 
about systematic changes to really 
help in the underserved communities. 
We saw, tragically, 2 weeks ago or 
close to 2 weeks ago, the tragic death 
in Minnesota. We have all talked about 
how we are going to help to make sure 
this country gives equal opportunity to 
all of our citizens, including under our 
criminal justice system. We also need 
to recognize that, if we are going to 
deal with the wealth gap in America, 
we have to deal with entrepreneurship, 
and this is one way we can do it—by 
building up these types of opportuni-
ties. 
Now, there is some good news in my 
State of Maryland that I want to share 
with my colleagues. Maryland had a 
very active women’s business center. 
As you know, our resource partners are 
critically important in helping under-
served and underbanked communities. 
Women-owned businesses are clearly in 
that category. We have a very effective 
women’s 
business 
center 
that 
is 
headquartered in Rockville that helps 
serve Montgomery and Prince George’s 
Counties and Frederick. It is doing a 
great job on behalf of women-owned 
businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2713 
June 4, 2020 
Maryland, though, is a big State, and 
we needed more help. So I thank the 
Small Business Administration in its 
announcement of two additional small 
business centers in the State of Mary-
land. One will be in Baltimore. It will 
be housed at Morgan State University, 
a historic HBCU. That will provide, I 
think, tremendous help for women- 
owned businesses and minority women- 
owned businesses. We are also opening 
up a center in Salisbury, on the East-
ern Shore of Maryland—rural Mary-
land—to help women’s businesses. This 
is critically important in dealing with 
the gap in our communities. Resource 
partners are of critical need. 
So, as we applaud the work we have 
done with the PPP program and as we 
recognize we need to improve it, let’s 
also recognize we need to deal with 
making sure there is a fair opportunity 
for all businesses to qualify. We are 
also going to need additional help for 
small businesses in addition to the 
PPP initial grant. There needs to be a 
second round, and let me tell you why. 
We thought 8 weeks would be enough 
with the PPP program, but we know 
that for some of the original small 
business loans that were taken out 
under the PPP program that, within 
the next 2 weeks, the 8-week period 
will expire, but we know that busi-
nesses are not yet open at full capac-
ity. Restaurants cannot open at full ca-
pacity. Catering establishments cannot 
open at full capacity. Health clubs can-
not open at full capacity. Entertain-
ment centers cannot open at full capac-
ity. We know that museums are still 
very much hurt, so we are going to 
need additional help. 
Yesterday, we heard from a small 
business owner whose company was 
helped by the PPP loan. He told us 
there will be additional need for bridge 
funding for small businesses experi-
encing unanticipated costs during the 
phased-in reopening. I agree with him. 
I think we are going to have to do more 
to help the small businesses in our 
communities. 
I have been working with Senator 
SHAHEEN and Senator COONS and others 
to say, on the second round, let’s try to 
target the relief to those companies 
that really need it. The first round— 
get the money out quickly. We were 
very successful in doing that. There 
was a minimal amount of underwriting 
requirements by the small businesses 
or the banks. We got the money out 
quickly. 
On the second round, we need to be 
more discerning. We need to focus 
those funds on those small businesses 
that really need it, those in the under-
served communities—the smaller of 
the small businesses. We heard that 
yesterday during our oversight hear-
ings. Those businesses have had a dra-
matic loss of revenue. If we do that, 
the resources are there; we can help 
those small businesses survive, and we 
can do it in a way that will keep our 
economy going. 
We need to do that immediately. We 
shouldn’t wait 2 more weeks after the 
program for many small businesses has 
already ended. We need to provide the 
help as soon as possible. That is an-
other reason it is important that we 
take up the next stimulus package dur-
ing this work period and not wait until 
businesses have to lay off their workers 
and may not be able to reopen. 
The PPP was only one of three tools. 
The second tool we provided was a new 
initiative under the EIDL Program, the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Pro-
gram, for grants. It provides for imme-
diate cash, which is what businesses 
need during a disaster—cash. The pro-
posal allowed for a $10,000 grant to be 
made. We anticipated that grant would 
be made within 3 days. We put that in 
the statute. 
As complimentary as I have been 
about the SBA starting up the PPP 
program, I am extremely disappointed 
in the manner in which the EIDL Pro-
gram has been handled. They did not 
get the money out quickly. They did 
not get $10,000 out; instead, the average 
grant was between $4,000 and $5,000. 
And there is $10 billion still left in the 
coffers that could have gotten out to 
small businesses that desperately need-
ed the cash, and they didn’t do it in the 
timeframe Congress anticipated. 
The existing loan program, which ex-
isted before COVID–19, where SBA 
issues loans during a disaster, called 
the Economic Injury Disaster Loans, 
provides working capital. It works with 
PPP. PPP is not enough help for a 
small business to get the working cap-
ital and inventory they need. That is 
why we have the EIDL loans. The SBA 
has been very slow in getting the loans 
out. The numbers are extremely dis-
appointing. 
Now they have set up new rules. They 
closed the window for nonagricultural 
small businesses. Why? I have no idea. 
They seem to be limiting loans to 
$150,000, although the loan provides for 
a $2 million cap. Why are they doing 
that? 
If the programs are going to work to-
gether, they have to implement this 
program. 
Congress 
specifically 
in-
tended COVID–19 to be a disaster cov-
ered by EIDL. We did that in our ear-
lier stimulus package. Well, we are dis-
appointed that we haven’t had greater 
success in the EIDL Program, because 
we know it works so much closer with 
the PPP program, and it is particularly 
useful for smaller small businesses and 
those that are more vulnerable. 
We had a witness yesterday, Nick Ru-
dolph of Maryland Capital Enterprises, 
who testified and said: 
The EIDL loan is a particularly impactful 
product . . . because of its low interest, long 
terms, eased credit requirements and the 
fact that collateral is not required. In a per-
fect world, all approved applicants would re-
ceive the full grant portion regardless of 
number of employees. 
What Mr. Rudolph is saying is they 
limited the grant to $1,000 per worker, 
and, therefore, if you had 10 or fewer 
workers, the most vulnerable of small 
businesses, you were not able to take 
advantage of the $10,000. We hope that 
will be corrected. 
There is a third tool. That is loan 
forgiveness for existing 7(a) and 504 
loans and microloans and for loans 
taken out during the 6-month period 
after the adoption of the bill through 
the end of the year. This gives 6 
months of debt relief for loans that can 
really help small businesses. I would 
like to report on how that is working, 
but I don’t have a lot of numbers on 
that, which leads me to the need for 
data. If we are going to carry out our 
oversight function, if we are going to 
be able to enact legislation going for-
ward, we need to know how the pro-
grams are working today, and we 
haven’t gotten the information we 
need. 
Earlier I authored a letter to Sen-
ators SCHUMER and WYDEN, asking the 
SBA to make that information avail-
able. Most recently, I joined Senator 
RUBIO in a similar request asking the 
Small 
Business 
Administration 
to 
make this information available. I in-
troduced legislation with Senator SHA-
HEEN on this issue. We need to get that 
data if we are going to do our over-
sight. 
This week we had the private sector 
witnesses; next week we have Adminis-
trator Carranza, Administrator of the 
SBA, and Secretary Mnuchin, Sec-
retary of the Treasury, to ask specifi-
cally about these points. It will be a 
very, very important hearing. 
In closing, let me say that we have to 
continue to work together as we have 
in the past to help America’s small 
businesses. 
They 
are 
literally 
the 
growth engine of our economy. They 
are the innovators of our economy, and 
they are the most vulnerable. 
The CARES Act provided incredibly 
important help, but we are going to 
have to pay additional attention to 
help our small businesses. So let’s con-
tinue this bipartisan effort not only to 
help small businesses but to help our 
economy and to help our country. In 
doing that we will truly perform as we 
should during this national emergency. 
So I look forward to continuing to 
work with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to pay attention to what 
we have already done for small busi-
nesses and give them the additional at-
tention that they need. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, be-
fore Senator CARDIN leaves the floor, I 
want to tell my colleague and friend on 
the Finance Committee that it has 
been a pleasure to team up with him to 
try to deal with these challenges in 
terms of getting the help out to small 
business people. We know that it has 
been needlessly challenging, looking 
back at the experience. I am just glad 
my colleague is going to prosecute the 
case until there is justice for these 
small businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2714 
June 4, 2020 
Pack to head up the U.S. Agency for 
Global Media. This typically is a job 
that doesn’t get a whole lot of atten-
tion here on the Senate floor, but this 
time, I believe it should. 
This is yet another Trump nominee 
who appears to be covering up a whole 
array of sketchy financial wheeling 
and self-dealing, and apparently my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are just looking the other way, not in-
terested. 
So here is the short version of the 
story. For more than a decade, Mr. 
Pack ran two entities—a nonprofit film 
organization and a for-profit produc-
tion company. His nonprofit raised mil-
lions of dollars under its tax-exempt 
status, and it pumped that money into 
his for-profit production company, no-
where else. At a minimum, this looks 
to me like a serious, flagrant abuse of 
a taxpayer subsidy. Mr. Pack made 
false statements about this arrange-
ment to the IRS. So as the ranking 
Democrat on the Finance Committee, I 
care greatly about that matter if one 
were to look at nothing else. 
When he was first nominated in the 
previous 
Congress, 
Mr. 
Pack 
got 
caught in these false statements by 
staff on the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. When he was renominated in 
this Congress and submitted new pa-
perwork, he made false statements 
about having made false statements. 
Truly astounding. 
Now there are a host of unanswered 
questions about Mr. Pack’s murky fi-
nancial dealings. Fortunately, Ranking 
Member MENENDEZ is still trying to get 
to the bottom of this. Now, Ranking 
Member MENENDEZ is doing his job by 
the book. He is doing his job. He has 
been in communication with the ad-
ministration when it comes to the vet-
ting process for the nominees and, 
every step along the way, has tried to 
do responsible vetting. 
Furthermore, the financial web of 
Mr. Pack is under investigation by the 
Attorney General of the District of Co-
lumbia. Why not wait to get the results 
of that investigation? Why rush to con-
firm a nominee before all the facts are 
before the Senate? This is a question 
over whether a nominee broke the law 
and ripped off taxpayers. 
When Democrats on the Senate com-
mittee of jurisdiction tried to inves-
tigate it, Mr. Pack told everybody to 
just go pound sand. So once again, we 
have a Trump nominee making a 
mockery of the Senate constitutional 
responsibility, and as far as I can tell, 
the Senate is just going to do nothing 
about it. 
(Mr. YOUNG assumed the Chair.) 
For my last few minutes, I just want 
to remind colleagues of the way things 
used to be. The way it used to be is 
both sides of the Senate took advice 
and consent seriously. For example, in 
2009, Chairman Baucus and Ranking 
Member GRASSLEY held up one nominee 
and wrote an exhaustive 12-page memo 
over a matter of $53 in local tax late 
fees and some sloppy paperwork. An-
other 2009 nomination, Ron Kirk, to be 
the U.S. Trade Representative, was 
held up for months over a tax matter 
involving some basketball tickets and 
a television he donated to his local 
YMCA. In 2010, another nominee was 
grilled in his hearing before the Fi-
nance Committee over a tax debt of 
$800. 
Senators on both sides of the aisle— 
both sides of the aisle—always tried to 
do a thorough vetting and tried to 
work on it together. In all three of 
these cases, which I remember as a 
member of the Finance Committee, the 
nominees answered the Senate’s ques-
tions, paid what they owed, and that 
was that. The Senate did its job, and it 
was the right thing to do. 
I think as we move to the vote here 
in the Senate, we ought to start talk-
ing about one question, and that is 
this: What has changed in the Senate 
about the vetting process of these 
nominees? What happened to the old 
bipartisan commitment to advise and 
consent, to fully vet nominees? The 
majority has just rubberstamped and 
rubberstamped 
and 
rubberstamped 
some more. Trump nominees show a 
blatant disregard and disdain for the 
oversight process that historically has 
been central to the bipartisan work of 
this body. 
Now the President might be totally 
indifferent to the role and duties of the 
Senate, but I don’t see any reason why 
Senators here, Democrats or Repub-
licans, have to agree with that. It un-
dermines the role of this Senate and 
the Congress as a coequal branch of 
government. The precedent of a bipar-
tisan vetting process simply cannot 
withstand it. 
It has been said here before that the 
Federal Government doesn’t need any-
body so badly that the person should 
get a special set of rules. That, regret-
tably, is the way it seems to be for this 
nominee—a nominee whose finances 
are currently under investigation and, 
apparently, with the majority’s sup-
port, is going to get confirmed because 
the majority has decided to essentially 
set aside years and years of bipartisan 
work, responsible work, to thoroughly 
investigate and vet those who are nom-
inated to serve in our government. 
I am going to oppose this nomina-
tion, and I hope my colleagues will 
think about what is really at issue 
here, because what goes around comes 
around. Is the Senate going to get seri-
ous about the way matters used to be 
handled, particularly on the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, since we have a 
member of our committee in the Pre-
siding Officer’s chair? The Senate Fi-
nance Committee did it right, did it 
right for years, by the books, in a bi-
partisan fashion. That is not being 
used here; in fact, it is being tossed out 
the window. I think the Senate is going 
to regret it. I urge my colleagues to op-
pose the nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL PACK 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow 
Senators, we are about to do the final 
vote on Michael Pack. This man is 
uniquely qualified to hold this posi-
tion. He has done an outstanding job. 
Everyone should look at the most re-
cent documentary he did on the Su-
preme Court. It was just outstanding. 
There has been a political fight over 
him for 2 years and 1 day. Today is the 
moment of truth. It is time to vote on 
Mr. Pack. Debate is closed. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON PACK NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Pack nomina-
tion? 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senator is 
necessarily absent: the Senator from 
North Carolina (Mr. BURR). 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Minnesota (Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR), the Senator from Massachu-

ator from Minnesota (Ms. SMITH), the 
Senator from Montana (Mr. TESTER), 
and the Senator from Massachusetts

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 35 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent for the expedited pas-
sage of H.R. 35, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act, as amended. I seek 
to amend this legislation not because I 
take lynching lightly but because I 
take it seriously, and this legislation 
does not. 
Lynching is a tool of terror that 
claimed the lives of nearly 5,000 Ameri-
cans between 1881 and 1968, but this bill 
would cheapen the meaning of lynching 
by defining it so broadly as to include 
a minor bruise or abrasion. Our Na-
tion’s history of racial terrorism de-
mands more seriousness from us than 
that. 
W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in his auto-
biography about the 1899 lynching of 
Sam Hose in Georgia. Du Bois wrote 
that, after the lynching, Hose’s knuck-
les were viewed on display at a store on 
Mitchell Street in Atlanta. His liver 
and heart were even presented to the 
Governor of Georgia as a souvenir. 
Sickening, grotesque—the images of 
lynching. 
In 1931, Raymond Gunn was lynched 
in Maryville, MO. The spectacle drew a 
crowd of almost 4,000 people, including, 
if you can believe it, women and their 
children. In the tragedy of lynching, 
the author writes that one woman even 
held her little girl up so high so she 
could better see the victim who was 
‘‘blazing on the roof.’’ 
Sickening and grotesque, these im-
ages. 
In the summer of 1955, 14-year-old 
Emmett Till was visiting family in 
Money, MS, when he went to a country 
store and bought some candy. While in 
there, he was accused of flirting with a 
White woman, and for that offense, 
Emmett Till was kidnapped in the mid-
dle of the night and bludgeoned so 
badly that, afterward, his body was un-
recognizable. He could only be identi-
fied by the ring he was wearing. After 
seeing her son’s remains, his mother 
insisted on having an open casket fu-
neral so the whole world could see 
what the killers had done to her son. 
We must remember the murders of 
Emmett Till, Raymond Gunn, Sam 
Hose, and the thousands of others 
whose lives were destroyed by the bar-
barity of the lynch mob, but this bill 
will not do that. This bill would expand 
the meaning of ‘‘lynching’’ to include 
any bodily injury, including a cut, an 
abrasion, or a bruise, physical pain, ill-
ness, or any other injury to the body, 
no matter how temporary. 
Words have meaning. It would be a 
disgrace for the Congress of the United 
States to declare that a bruise is 
lynching, that an abrasion is lynching, 
that any injury to the body, no matter 
how temporary, is on par with the 
atrocities done to people like Emmett 
Till, Raymond Gunn, and Sam Hose, 
who were killed for no reason but be-
cause they were Black. To do that 
would demean their memories and 
cheapen the historic and horrific leg-
acy of lynching in our country. 
As Congressman AMASH stated, ‘‘To 
be clear, the bill does not make lynch-
ing a new Federal hate crime. Mur-
dering someone on account of their 
race or conspiring to do so is now ille-
gal under Federal law. It is already a 
Federal crime, and it is already a hate 
crime.’’ 
He is right. We have had Federal hate 
crime statutes for over 50 years, and it 
has been a Federal hate crime to mur-
der someone because of his race for 
over a decade. Additionally, murder is 
already a crime in 50 States. In fact, 
rather than considering a good-inten-
tioned but symbolic bill, the Senate 
could immediately consider addressing 
qualified immunity and ending police 
militarization. 
We can and must do better. That is 
why no one in the Senate has been 
more involved in criminal justice re-
form than I have. No one has intro-
duced more criminal justice reform 
bills. In my time in the Senate, I have 
authored or cosponsored at least 22 
unique criminal justice reform bills. I 
am acutely aware of the injustices per-
petrated year in and year out in our 
cities, but reform needs to be more 
than window dressing. 
That is why I am on the floor today 
to offer the expedited passage—pass it 
today—of 
the 
Emmett 
Till 
Antilynching Act, as amended. Lynch-
ing is a particularly vicious kind of 
murder, and a Federal law should treat 
it as such. For these reasons, the Em-
mett Till Antilynching Act should be 
adopted with my amendment, which 
would apply the criminal penalties for 
lynching only and not for other crimes. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 35, which 
was received by the House. I ask unani-
mous consent that my amendment at 
the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed, and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from California. 
Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, the idea 
that we would not be taking the issue 
of lynching seriously is an insult, an 
insult to Senator BOOKER, to Senator 
TIM SCOTT, to me, and to all of the Sen-
ators, past and present, who have un-
derstood that this is part of the great 
stain of America’s history. 
To suggest that anything short of 
pulverizing someone so much that the 
casket would otherwise be closed ex-
cept for the heroism and courage of 
Emmett Till’s mother, to suggest that 
lynching would only be a lynching if 
someone’s heart were pulled out and 
produced and displayed to someone else 
is ridiculous—and on this day, the day 
of George Floyd’s funeral and a day 
that should be a day of national 
mourning. 
In 2018, the Senate unanimously 
passed bipartisan antilynching legisla-
tion, which I proudly introduced with 
the only other Black Members of this 
body—Senator CORY BOOKER and Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT. It was a historic mo-
ment. It marked the first time in the 
history of our country that Federal 
antilynching 
legislation 
had 
been 
passed by the U.S. Senate. It passed 
again by unanimous consent in 2019. 
Senator PAUL is now trying to weak-
en a bill that was already passed. There 
is no reason for this. Senator PAUL’s 
amendment would place a greater bur-
den on victims of lynching than is cur-
rently required under Federal hate 
crimes laws. There is no reason for 
this. There is no reason other than its 
being cruel and deliberate obstruction 
on a day of mourning. 
On this very day, at this very hour, 
there is a memorial service to honor 
the life of George Floyd, who was mur-
dered on a sidewalk by a police officer, 
with a knee on his neck. For 8 minutes 
46 seconds, George Floyd pled for his 
life, called for his late mother, and said 
he could not breathe. The pain experi-
enced not only by that man, that 
human being and his family and his 
children, but the pain of the people of 
America witnessing what we have wit-
nessed since the founding of this coun-
try, which is that the Black lives have

not been taken seriously as being fully 
human and deserving of dignity—and it 
should not require a maiming or tor-
ture in order for us to recognize a 
lynching when we see it and recognize 
it by Federal law and call it what it is, 
which is that it is a crime that should 
be punishable with accountability and 
consequence. 
So it is remarkable and it is painful 
to be standing here right now, espe-
cially when people of all races are 
marching in the streets of America, 
outraged by the hate and the violence 
and the murder that has been fueled by 
racism during the span of this coun-
try’s life. America is raw right now. 
Her wound exposed. Raw from the fact 
that in the history of our country, 
Black people have been treated as less 
than human. 
I stood here with Senator BOOKER 
when we first proposed this lynching 
law, and we talked about the pain and 
the history of the pain of this issue in 
America. The fact is that the country 
is raw because America has never fully 
addressed the historic and systemic 
racism that has existed in our country. 
Our bill, in its current form, is an op-
portunity—it is an opportunity for this 
body to acknowledge the seriousness of 
this, to acknowledge that if someone 
places a noose over someone else’s 
neck, why would it be required that in 
addition their heart would be pulled 
out or their body pulverized to the 
point beyond recognition? 
Our bill is an opportunity to right a 
wrong and an opportunity for a reck-
oning in Federal law. We cannot pre-
tend that lynchings are a thing of the 
past. Ahmaud Arbery was a victim of a 
modern-day lynching. He was murdered 
on February 23, 2020, 3 months ago. 
Today, we learned that one of the men 
who killed Mr. Arbery used a racial 
slur after shooting him. He should be 
alive today, and his killers should be 
brought to justice. No longer should 
the crime of lynching go unpunished. 
No longer should victims and their 
families go without justice. 
In closing, Ida B. Wells once said: 
Our country’s national crime is lynching. 
It is not the creature of an hour, the sudden 
outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the un-
speakable brutality of an insane mob. It rep-
resents the cool, calculating deliberation of 
intelligent people who openly avow that 
there is an ‘‘unwritten law’’ that justifies 
them in putting human beings to death with-
out complaint under oath, without trial by 
jury, without opportunity to make defense, 
and without right of appeal. 
Our country has waited too long for a 
reckoning on this issue of lynching, 
and I believe no Senator should stop 
the full weight of the law in its capac-
ity to protect these human beings and 
human life. 
Senator BOOKER and I are working on 
a comprehensive bill to address this 
hurt and the tragedy at the heart of 
this national day of mourning, and I 
object to Senator PAUL’s efforts to 
weaken this legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to Senator PAUL’s request? 
Mr. BOOKER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator HARRIS for her words, 
and I want to thank her as the lead 
Senator on this bill. I want to thank 
her for her partnership and leadership. 
I also want to thank Senator TIM 
SCOTT
of South Carolina, who has 
shown extraordinary commitment to 
this legislation as well. On the House 
side, I want to thank BOBBY
RUSH, 
former Black Panther. I want to thank 
him for his leadership and generational 
commitment to racial justice in Amer-
ica. 
I also want to recognize the tireless 
advocacy of Airickca Gordon-Taylor, 
who is the actual relative of Emmett 
Till and founder of the Mamie Till 
Mobley Memorial Foundation. She was 
here the last time this bill was before 
this body. She is dead now. I know she 
is looking down and hoping that we 
don’t disappoint her. 
In February of 2019, this body did 
something historic—and I don’t mean 
to be emotional. I am raw this week. 
But I stood here with KAMALA and we 
wept. We talked about the hundreds of 
years—over a century, excuse me, of ef-
fort to pass legislation which was 
brought up and defeated time and 
again by this body by avowed seg-
regationists. How proud I was that at a 
time when partisanship is high in this 
country we gathered together in one 
voice, 100 Senators, to pass this exact 
same bill, because there are good peo-
ple in this body on both sides, and we 
were correcting a wrong of history. 
Nobody in this body needs a lecture 
on lynching and how horrible it is. Ev-
erybody in this body abhors racism and 
believes that this violence is unjust. 
There are friends of mine here. Unani-
mously, we passed that legislation. We 
made history on this floor. 
This is why I am confused because 
this bill has been passed unanimously, 
and here we are on a day of a memorial 
service for another person whose mur-
der was condemned by people on both 
sides of the aisle. I have sat where the 
Presiding Officer is sitting, and I have 
watched the differences between the 
Republican leader and the Democratic 
leader. I don’t go back that long in this 
body, but I have watched Harry Reid 
and MITCH
MCCONNELL
and CHUCK 
SCHUMER disagree so deeply time and 
again, but, God, we came together and 
passed the bill unanimously. MITCH 
MCCONNELL let the bill come to this 
floor, didn’t try to block it. 
My colleague RAND PAUL was one of 
the first hands I shook on this Senate 
floor. He is my friend, and everything 
he said about his commitment to 
criminal justice reform is right. One of 
the first bills I wrote here I wrote with 
RAND PAUL, and then he went further 
at another time like this when Amer-
ica was raw, when another unarmed 
Black man was shot. He went as far as 
to, in Time magazine, stand up and 
talk openly about the ProPublica data 
about a Black man in America being 
about 100 times more likely to be shot 
by the police than someone who is 
White. 
He has said—and he is shaking his 
head, if I may recognize. He said that 
there must be something more going 
on there if it is that much. So I do not 
question—I do not question the sin-
cerity of his convictions. I have had 
too many conversations with him to 
question his heart, but I am so raw 
today, of all days, that we are doing 
this—of all days, that we are doing this 
right now, having this discussion when, 
God, if this bill passed today, what 
that would mean for America; that this 
body and that body have now finally 
agreed because I know when Congress-
man White, the last Black person to 
serve in Congress before the God-awful 
fall of the backlash after Reconstruc-
tion fell. He gave this famous speech. 
We were talking about the Phoenix will 
rise; that one day Black people will 
serve in this body. And here we are in 
the Senate for the first time in history, 
when three African Americans serve 
together, Republican and Democratic, 
and we all came together on KAMALA’s 
bill. 
There is something about us that we 
knew it was something more than the 
legalistic issues my colleague now 
wants to bring up; that we are a nation 
that needs this historic healing. If we 
passed this, it would not only do some-
thing substantive to make a difference 
on the books of the American system, 
but, God, it would speak volumes to 
the racial pain and the hurt of genera-
tions. 
I do not need my colleague, the Sen-
ator from Kentucky, to tell me about 
one lynching in this country. I have 
stood in the museum in Montgomery, 
AL, and watched African-American 
families weeping at the stories of preg-
nant women lynched in this country 
and their babies ripped out of them 
while this body did nothing. I can hear 
the screams, as this body’s membership 
can, of the unanswered cries for justice 
by our ancestors. Every one of us is 
sensitive to that anguish. Everyone is 
sensitive to that pain, as is the Senator 
from Kentucky. 
This week, the Senator from Ken-
tucky mentioned a colleague, JUSTIN 
AMASH. I want to tell my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, he was only one 
of four Congressmen of a 435–Member 
body to vote against the anti-lynching 
bill. That means that this bill was sup-
ported by the leader of the Democrats, 
the Speaker of House. It was supported 
by the leader of the Republicans, the 
whip of the Republicans, the whip of 
the 
Democrats—400-plus 
votes 
sup-
ported this. Yet my colleague thinks 
this bill is wrong. 
If this bill is wrong, then the Repub-
lican leadership of the House is wrong. 
If this bill is wrong, then the Demo-
cratic leadership of the House is wrong. 
If this bill is wrong, 99 Senators are 
wrong. If this bill is wrong, then the

NAACP is wrong. If this bill is wrong, 
then the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil 
Rights Under Law is wrong. If this bill 
is wrong, then the Urban League of 
America is wrong, legal organizations, 
civil rights organizations, Democrats 
and Republicans. Tell me another time 
when 500-plus Congresspeople, Demo-
crats, Republicans, House Members, 
and Senators came together in a cho-
rus of conviction and said that now is 
the time in America that we condemn 
the dark history of our past and actu-
ally pass anti-lynchings legislation. 
And now one man—and I do not ques-
tion his motives because I know his 
heart—one man—one man is standing 
in the way of the law of the land 
changing because of a difference of in-
terpretation. 
This doesn’t talk about bruising 
someone. It is a difference of interpre-
tation. 
Does America need a win today on 
racial justice? Do the anguished cries 
of people in the streets? 
I have had children break down with 
me this week wondering if this would 
be a country that values their lives as 
much as White people’s lives. I had to 
explain to grown men this week that 
there is still hope in America; that we 
could make change in America; that we 
could grow and heal in America; that 
we could make this a more perfect 
Union. 
Well, today is a day we can do it—to 
have one Member to yield for once, like 
he did in February of 2019, yield for 1 
day and give America this win. Let us 
pass this piece of legislation today of 
all days. Let’s give a headline tomor-
row of something that will give hope to 
this country that we can get it right. It 
may not cure the ills that so many are 
protesting about, but, God, it could be 
a sign of hope. 
So, Mr. President, I object to this 
amendment. I object. I object. I object 
on substance. I object on the law. For 
my heart and spirit and every fiber of 
my being, I object for my ancestors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator for Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. I think it is important to 
know and let the record show that I 
have been working with Senator BOOK-
ER’s office for 3 months on the amend-
ment of this bill; that I am willing to 
have unanimous passage of the bill 
today, but I think it is incredibly im-
portant that we get this right. 
A Black woman in New Jersey as-
saulted 
three 
Jewish 
women 
and 
slapped them. It was terrible. She ut-
tered racial epithets about these Jew-
ish women. She was charged with 
third-degree misdemeanor assault with 
up to 1 year in prison, which to me 
sounds pretty significant for slapping, 
but she was then charged with a hate 
crime in addition to that, which was 4 
years in addition. 
If slapping someone and hurling ra-
cial epithets gets you 10 years in pris-
on, this is exactly what we have been 
fighting about in criminal justice re-
form. We set up a system and didn’t 
pay attention to the penalties, and all 
of a sudden things we didn’t intend 
happened. So we have to be smart 
about this. 
I am willing to pass the bill today, as 
amended, which would simply say not 
that you even have to harm someone— 
you have to attempt to harm them, but 
it has to be an attempt to harm them. 
So all the discussion about bruising 
while trying to lynch someone—yes, 
that is attempted murder. It would be 
covered by this bill. Nothing in the bill 
would stop or prevent the prosecution 
of heinous behavior. That is what it is 
intended for. 
What I am trying to do is to make 
sure we don’t get unintended con-
sequences. 
We 
fought 
the 
battle 
against mandatory minimums for a 
decade now because we tie up people in 
sentencing that makes no sense. Ten 
years for slapping someone would be an 
abomination, and it could happen to 
anyone. Do we want a Black woman 
who slapped three Jewish women in 
New Jersey to get 10 years in prison? If 
there is a group of them, it is now a 
conspiracy to lynch. 
We have to use some common sense 
here. We should not have a 10-year pris-
on sentence for anything less than, at 
the very least, an attempt to do bodily 
harm. The statute lists what bodily 
harm is, but it could still be an at-
tempt. It doesn’t mean you actually 
have to have it, but what it would pre-
clude is when somebody shoves some-
body in a bar and they fall down and 
have an abrasion and they say: ‘‘He did 
it because of a racial animus toward 
me,’’ and then you have a 10-year pen-
alty. That is not right. 
All of us are advocates on the same 
side of criminal justice reform. We 
have all argued on the same side that 
the law is screwed up and has incarcer-
ated too many people unfairly. That is 
what I am trying to prevent here. So 
the point is, I understand the emotions 
about this. Do you think I take great 
joy in being here? No. I am the sponsor 
of 22 criminal justice bills. Do you 
think I am getting any good publicity 
on this? No. I will be excoriated by 
simpleminded people on the internet 
who think I don’t like Emmett Till or 
appreciate the history and the memory 
of Emmett Till. I will be lectured to by 
everybody that I have got no right to 
have an opinion on any of these things, 
and I should be quiet. 
But we cannot just not read our bills. 
I have worked in an honest way with 
Senator BOOKER’s office for 3 months 
on this bill. We have gone back and 
forth. We gave them some language. 
They came back to us and said it 
wouldn’t work, and I said: What about 
this, and we haven’t gotten any more 
responses. We haven’t gotten responses 
back in a month or more. 
The situation now is they are liti-
gating in the press and trying to ac-
cuse me of being in favor of something 
so heinous that it makes my skin crawl 
and makes me sick to my stomach to 
even read the accounts about what 
happened. 
But we also ought to be fair and hon-
est about this. Lynching is illegal. Peo-
ple who say there is no Federal law 
against lynching are not telling the 
truth. The law says that if you kill 
somebody and you have racial animus, 
under the hate crimes statute, it is il-
legal. You can’t do that. It is also ille-
gal in all the States. This bill does not 
make lynching illegal. So for all the 
discussion of that, this bill creates a 
new crime called conspiracy to lynch. 
Oh, yes, I am for it. If there is a crowd, 
let’s arrest the whole mob. All four po-
licemen should be responsible for what 
happened to Mr. Floyd. 
The thing is, when we do that, we 
have to be careful that we don’t then 
put a crowd of people in where someone 
pushed 
into 
someone 
or 
someone 
slapped someone. 
There has to be justice. People are 
chanting ‘‘justice.’’ Justice has to have 
a brain and has to have vision and 
can’t be hamstrung into something 
that could give someone 10 years in 
prison for a minor crime. 
This is a very minor attempt. Every-
thing we left in here we have worked 
with Senator BOOKER’s office to make 
sure it is inclusive. They came back 
and said: What about attempted? We 
said: Let’s change the language. So we 
have in there ‘‘attempt to cause seri-
ous bodily harm.’’ 
So there could be no injury, but 
someone will have to have a discussion 
of whether there was an attempt and it 
was an attempt that looked like it 
would be serious. So I think slapping 
someone isn’t, but under the current 
statute as is—people say: Ah, nobody 
will ever do it. Maybe, but we are put-
ting it on the books. 
The mandatory minimums have kept 
people in jail for decades. There are 
people who have life for nonviolent 
crimes. All of us have worked on the 
same side of that issue. 
I am asking for a very minor change. 
I will pass it right now. I am com-
pletely out of the way. I am for the 
bill. I am asking unanimous consent to 
pass the bill today with one amend-
ment that just says let’s be careful not 
to arrest people for slapping someone 
or not arrest somebody for pushing 
into someone and get them 10 years in 
prison. 
This isn’t about someone trying to 
kill another person or someone at-
tempting bodily harm. Those people 
would be included in this language 
even if they did not have a mark on the 
person. But if they were rounding him 
up, tying him up, and they had thrown 
a rope over a tree, that is attempted 
murder. They would still be included 
under this bill, even without a mark on 
them. 
What we have to preclude and what 
we are trying to preclude is that the 
bill doesn’t get used for the wrong pur-
poses. We are all on the same side 
about whom we want to punish and 
whom we should prevent. We are also

on the same side on the symbolism of 
this, but we can’t pass laws that do ex-
actly what all of us have said is wrong 
with our penal system, all of the unin-
tended consequences. There is one here, 
and I ask, in a very polite way—I have 
been asking for 3 months—for one 
small change, and I will let the bill go 
today, on this day, if we can have it. 
The changes have been out there. 
They are not brand-new. They have 
been in Senator BOOKER’s office for 3 
months. We have tried to, as he has 
had objections, work with him on his 
objections. 
So I would ask unanimous consent, 
once again, to pass the bill, as amend-
ed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BOOKER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, this is a 
bill that has already passed this body. 
Same bill, same language. There was 
no objection. Only four Members of the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
objected. 
Same bill, same language. 
I have heard this objection. We dis-
agree with this. The truth is, what is 
being proposed is not just opposed by 
me, but our Republican colleagues who 
are sponsoring this bill, in this body, 
oppose these corrections as well. 
In addition to that, changes to this 
bill now would send it back to the 
House of Representatives. This is a tac-
tic that will send this bill back over to 
the House, where again it would have 
to be voted on. 
This idea that somehow someone 
would be brought up on lynching 
charges for a slapping is absurd, espe-
cially as you see, with hate crime legis-
lation, how difficult that is even to 
prove. 
So I am deeply disappointed by the 
objections we have heard that were not 
made manifest last year, in 2019, but 
somehow seem to be stopping it in 2020. 
So I object, with this prediction: We, as 
a body, will correct historic ills and 
pass lynching legislation through this 
body, through the House of Representa-
tives. One day in this Nation, this leg-
islation will pass. 
Perhaps it will have to wait until I 
am not here, until Senator PAUL is not 
here, unless he decides to go back to 
the 2019 Senator PAUL. 
The question is, What side of history 
will we ultimately be on? I pray that it 
happens in this Congress. I pray that 
the President signs legislation against 
lynching. How historic that would be. 
But today it is not going to happen, ob-
viously. 
I am telling you right now, this cele-
bration will come. This moment in 
American history will come. The frus-
trating thing for me is, at a time when 
this 
country 
hungers 
for 
common 
sense, racial reconciliation, an ac-
knowledgement of our past and a look-
ing forward to the better future, this 
will be one of the sad days where that 
possibility was halted. 
As we all know, one of the great lead-
ers that Republicans and Democrats all 
hail asked that question—How long 
will it take?—and the simple answer is 
not long because the truth crushed to 
earth will rise again; not long because 
you reap what you sow; not long be-
cause the arc of the moral universe is 
long but it bends toward justice. 
We will pass this legislation. I pray 
that the Members of this body, as we 
are right now, are the ones to do it. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, be-
fore my colleagues exit the Chamber, I 
want to acknowledge their words. I 
want to say thank you. The passion, 
the emotion, the true rawness in your 
words are words that I think all of us, 
as Members of the Senate, should hear, 
reflect, and respect. I just want you to 
know I am thankful I was on the floor 
to personally hear. Because we can 
read words, but it is when we have the 
ability to hear and to feel those words 
that their true meaning comes out, so 
I appreciate and I thank you for that. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
had asked to come and speak on the 
floor of the Senate on this day, June 4. 
I have been actually looking forward to 
it and planning speaking time for 
months now. 
June 4 is a significant day in the 
fight for women’s suffrage. It was on 
June 4 of 1919 that Congress approved 
the amendment and sent it to the 
States for ratification, and then it was 
in 1920 that the 19th Amendment was 
ratified by the States. 
So this was to be a time of celebra-
tion, of recognition, of women’s suf-
frage, this centennial event. 
Since that time that I first looked to 
schedule this, my, how the world has 
changed. We have been in the midst of 
a 
pandemic—over 
100,000 
American 
lives lost to the COVID–19 virus. We 
are in the midst of an economic crisis 
the likes of which we haven’t seen in 
decades and decades. 
And, just a week ago now, we wit-
nessed the killing of George Floyd on 
our streets, in broad daylight. And 
today, June 4, is not only a recognition 
of women’s suffrage, but it is the fu-
neral of George Floyd. 
So before I speak to the matter I in-
tended to speak on today, I want to 
just briefly comment on where I be-
lieve we are as a nation right now. 
I was walking into work this morn-
ing, and in my neighbor’s yard is a 
placard, a yard sign. It has been there 
for some years, actually, now. It is a 
partial quote of Martin Luther King 
that states: ‘‘We can’t be silent about 
the things that matter.’’ 
You think about those things that 
matter: equality, justice, the funda-
mental truth that all human beings are 
created equal and endowed by God with 
certain rights. And when those rights 
are denied, when they are violated, it is 
our responsibility to address the injus-
tice. It is not our responsibility as 
elected Members of the U.S. Senate; it 
is our responsibility as fellow humans, 
as Americans who believe in these prin-
ciples of justice and equality. 
President Bush had some words this 
week that I found very direct, very 
comforting at a difficult time when it 
is hard to be comforted, when our spir-
its are so discomforted and agitated 
right now. But he reminded us that 
achieving justice for all is the duty of 
all. It is the duty of all. 
And we are hurting now as a nation. 
We have wounds from racism that have 
never been allowed to heal—and those 
words were just shared here on this 
floor moments ago—wounds that have 
never been allowed to heal, wounds 
that are still so open and raw. And 
healing can’t take place until the hurt 
and the anger and the anguish that so 
many in this country still feel, so 
many African Americans, so many—so 
many who feel that the system is 
meant for somebody but not them; that 
there is not equal justice under the 
law; that it must be the law for some-
body else. 
This has been hard—hard on all of us, 
as we have seen the protests, many of 
them peaceful. In my home State, 
Alaskans are coming together with a 
shared sense of duty and responsibility 
to speak up about things that matter 
and doing so in a way that brings us to-
gether rather than divides. 
We must condemn the violence we 
see on the street with the looting, but 
stopping the looting is not going to 
close this wound. We heal when we ac-
knowledge our weaknesses, when we 
acknowledge our failures, and when we 
vow to address the things that matter, 
like equality and justice. 
What we say and how we say it truly 
matters. I have been challenged by 
some. I have been chastised by some 
very close friends who have said: You 
are silent, Lisa. Why are you silent? 
Why haven’t you—you—fixed what we 
are seeing? 
And I have struggled. I have strug-
gled with the right words. As a White 
woman born and raised in Alaska with 
a family who was privileged, I can’t 
feel that openness and rawness that I 
just heard expressed by my friends 
CORY and KAMALA. I haven’t lived their 
life. 
But I can listen, and I can educate 
myself. And I can try to be a healer at 
a time when we need to be healed. That 
is my commitment and my pledge 
going forward to those I serve in Alas-
ka and to those I serve in this country. 
This is challenging for us. We know 
this, but we are an extraordinary coun-
try. We are an extraordinary people 
with extraordinary resilience.

WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let 
me turn to the fight—the century fight

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2719 
June 4, 2020 
for women’s suffrage, the right to vote, 
the right to be treated equally, the 
right to be heard. It is a history that is 
long and interesting, sometimes very 
colorful. 
I have had an opportunity these past 
couple of weeks to be reading a collec-
tion of stories about how women in the 
West worked to really be the van-
guards, if you will, on the suffrage 
movement. You don’t necessarily hear 
them spoken to with great frequency, 
but, in fairness, it is many of those 
Western States—it was Wyoming that 
was the first mover. 
So reading some of their stories was 
a good reminder—a good reminder—of 
the role that many in Alaska have also 
played. We have been relatively pro-
gressive when it comes to women’s 
rights—so progressive that many Alas-
kan 
women 
received 
equal 
voting 
rights with men in 1913. This was 7 
years before the 19th Amendment was 
ratified. Alaska was still a territory 
and was still going to be a territory for 
a long time going forward. 
The sorry and the sad part of that 
history, though, was that not all Alas-
kan women were given that right to 
vote. Alaskan Native women were ex-
cluded. They were excluded based on 
citizenship and civility assessment as 
well as literacy tests that prevented 
Alaska Natives—not just the women 
but some Native men—from voting for 
several more decades. 
We recognize through a State day of 
observation and recognition the work 
of Elizabeth Peratrovich, an Alaska 
Native woman from Southeastern Alas-
ka, who was the driving force behind 
our first antidiscrimination law. This 
was back in 1945, nearly 20 years before 
Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. 
This year, on the 75th anniversary of 
the bill’s passage, the U.S. Mint has ac-
tually created a gold coin in her honor. 
As you look at that coin and reflect on 
her role, on the significance of that 
proud, strong, fierce Native woman 
leader, you can’t help but be proud of 
her. 
The fight for women’s suffrage was 
waged, as we know, for decades and 
decades. But again, the women in the 
West led the way. 
As I was reading the recount of the 
Alaska suffrage initiative, it was re-
flected that the women in Alaska 
didn’t really have to work that hard to 
get it; that it was just ‘‘provided’’ to 
them. I think there is more to that his-
tory than that, but a newspaper publi-
cation at the time, The Daily Alaskan, 
in 1904, argued that while women’s suf-
frage might be disfavored as a general 
proposition, the merits were different 
in Alaska. 
And he says the women there ‘‘are 
brave and noble helpers in the develop-
ment of a frontier country’’ and ‘‘not 
the pampered dolls of society.’’ 
So today it still probably holds true 
that we have some pretty strong 
women in Alaska. We own and operate 
fishing vessels. We work as oil rig oper-
ators, diesel mechanics. We have some 
extraordinary Alaskan women, indus-
try leaders leading our Alaska Native 
corporations, leading our oil compa-
nies. We are leaders in education and 
advocates for children and seniors and 
victims of domestic violence. They 
truly have helped not only our State 
but our country. 
The 100th Anniversary of Women’s 
Suffrage is a reminder of the progress 
that we have made as a nation. But we 
know that we have more to do and that 
inequities remain whether in the work-
force or pay equality. Continuing that 
work is a matter that we have not re-
laxed on. That work includes getting 
the Equal Rights Amendment signed 
into law. 
The Equal Rights Amendment was 
first written and introduced by Alice 
Paul at a conference commemorating 
the 75th anniversary of the Seneca 
Falls Convention in 1923. But it wasn’t 
until 1972 that the ERA passed through 
Congress and was sent to the States 
with a 7-year deadline for ratification 
that was eventually extended until 
1982. 
It is a pretty simple amendment. It is 
pretty short. ‘‘Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any state on 
account of sex.’’ That is the Equal 
Rights Amendment, in addition to the 
implementing 
provisions 
following 
that. But that is the context. 
In Alaska, I am proud to say that we 
were one of the early adopters, having 
ratified the Equal Rights Amendment 
on April 5, 1972. More recently, Vir-
ginia became the 38th State to have 
ratified the amendment, which brings 
us to the three-fourths threshold need-
ed for ratification. Unfortunately, this 
milestone was reached after the dead-
line for ratification. It had already ex-
pired, so Senator CARDIN and I have in-
troduced a resolution, S.J. Res. 6, 
which would remove the time limit 
from the joint resolution that passed 
the Congress in 1972. 
I have asserted time and again—and 
Senator CARDIN, so many—we have said 
that you cannot put a time limit on 
women’s equality. It has been 100 years 
since women were granted the equal 
right of voting. Women’s equality is 
fundamental to the American way of 
life, and it is far past time to be ex-
pressly recognized in the Constitution. 
I thank Senator CARDIN for his lead-
ership in working on this resolution 
with me and all the Members of Con-
gress who fought with us in support of 
the ERA. I thank the advocates who 
continue to call their Senators, call 
their 
Congressmen, 
who 
lift 
their 
voices to support this important cause. 
We have work to do. We will continue 
that work. 
I want to note that my colleague 
Senator CARDIN was here on the floor, 
was planning to speak on this matter 
today, but our time schedules got com-
pressed, so his statement has been in-
cluded as part of the RECORD. I want to 
acknowledge the good work and the 
partnership that we have on this. 
With this, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in this 
time of renewed interest for fairness 
and equality for all men and women 
and nationwide and worldwide protests, 
I urge my colleagues to think about 
what we can do to create a more just 
society. Indeed, one of the founding 
documents of our country, the Declara-
tion of Independence, provides that 
‘‘all men are created equal,’’ in the fa-
mous words of Thomas Jefferson. 
But let me remind my colleagues 
about our history here as the Conti-
nental Congress met to debate inde-
pendence of the United States from 
Great Britain. In a letter dated March 
31, 1776, Abigail Adams wrote to her 
husband, the future President John 
Adams, urging him and the other Mem-
bers of the Continental Congress not to 
forget about the Nation’s women when 
fighting for America’s freedom. 
The future First Lady wrote in part, 
‘‘I long to hear that you have declared 
an independency. And, by the way, in 
the new code of laws which I suppose it 
will be necessary for you to make, I de-
sire you would remember the ladies 
and be more generous and favorable to 
them than our ancestors. Do not put 
such unlimited power into the hands of 
the husbands. Remember, all men 
would be tyrants if they could. If par-
ticular care and attention is not paid 
to the ladies, we are determined to fo-
ment a rebellion, and will not hold our-
selves bound by any laws in which we 
have no voice or representation.’’ 
Well, women of the United States 
would indeed have to wait a long time 
just to get the right to vote in Amer-
ica. Indeed, even after the Civil War, 
which almost tore this country apart 
over slavery, the Fifteenth Amendment 
ratified by Congress and the States in 
1870 provided that ‘‘the right of citizens 
of the United States to vote shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any State on account of 
race, color, or previous condition of 
servitude.’’ Women had tried again to 
include the right to vote in the Con-
stitution but were rebuffed. 
But the women of this country did 
not give up. So they kept agitating and 
lobbying for the right to vote, and they 
were ultimately successful, when Con-
gress and the States ratified the 19th 
Amendment in 1920, which states: ‘‘The 
right of citizens of the United States to 
vote shall not be denied or abridged by 
the United States or by any State on 
account of sex. Congress shall have 
power to enforce this article by appro-
priate legislation.’’ 
However, while women in American 
gained the right to vote in 1920, we all 
know that women are still not treated 
equally under the law and that civil 
rights are the great unfinished business 
of America. 
Our fight for the Equal Rights 
Amendment, 
ERA, 
officially 
began 
shortly after passage of the 19th 
Amendment, the culmination of the 
long-running women’s suffrage move-
ment that guaranteed women the right 
to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2720 
June 4, 2020 
Alice Paul, leader of the National 
Women’s Party, recognized the need for 
further laws in order to provide full 
legal equality to women in all activi-
ties, not just voting. Her proposal for 
an amendment for equal treatment 
under the law regardless of sex marked 
the first iteration of the ERA. U.S. 
Senator Charles Curtis would introduce 
this proposal for the first time in Octo-
ber 1921. Over the years, both the 
Democratic Party and the Republican 
Party would include the ERA in their 
platforms. Presidents Eisenhower and 
Kennedy both indicated their support 
for the ERA. Needless to say, the ERA 
has a long history, and throughout 
that time, it enjoyed the notable bipar-
tisan support. 
The ERA has been able to count on 
such support precisely because of the 
widespread need recognized by both 
sides of the aisle for equal treatment 
under the law. What is at stake here is 
simply the issue of putting women on 
an even playing field with men. This is 
not 
about 
empowering 
one 
demo-
graphic group over another, but ensur-
ing that discrimination on the basis of 
sex is no longer an obstacle to prevent 
women from enjoying the same rights 
and protections that men enjoy. 
As the late Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia articulated: ‘‘Certainly 
the Constitution does not require dis-
crimination on the basis of sex. The 
only issue is whether it prohibits it. It 
doesn’t.’’ The fight for the ERA aims 
to fill this gap in the law. 
When Congresswoman Martha Grif-
fiths introduced her ERA in Congress 
in the 92nd Congress, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the measure by a 
vote of 354 yeas to 24 nays. Five months 
later, the Senate passed it by a vote of 
84 yeas to 8 nays. It received an imme-
diate 
endorsement 
from 
President 
Richard Nixon upon its passage. While 
the ERA would in time become ratified 
by most States, it fell just three short 
of the three-fourths requirement of 38 
by the measure’s deadline of March 22, 
1979. 
When Senator MURKOWSKI and I came 
together to introduce S.J. Res. 6 on 
January 26, 2019, we committed our-
selves to advancing this nearly cen-
tury-long fight for equality between 
men and women. Our measure would 
remove the deadline for ratification. 
Remember that the Constitution con-
tains no deadline for the ratification of 
constitutional amendments, and in 1992 
Congress declared the 27th Amendment 
ratified after more than 200 years, 
which prohibits Congress from chang-
ing its own pay before an intervening 
election. And the States have recently 
woken up when it comes to the ERA, 
with Illinois, Nevada, and, most re-
cently, Virginia ratifying the ERA, 
reaching the number of 38 State ratifi-
cations, 
or 
three-quarters 
of 
the 
States. 
I would note that our companion 
House resolution introduced by Con-
gresswoman JACKIE SPEIER was passed 
by the House earlier this year, and so 
this issue is awaiting final action in 
the Senate. 
As Congress looks to what it can do 
to create a more just society, ratifica-
tion of the Equal Rights Amendment, 
ERA, would finally give women the 
legal protection consistent with ideals 
of our Nation. I am therefore proud to 
have partnered with Republican Sen-
ator LISA MURKOWSKI of Alaska in in-
troducing a joint resolution that would 
remove the deadline for ratification of 
this crucial amendment. 
And we picked this historic day to 
discuss it, as the Senate approved the 
women’s suffrage amendment—the 19th 
Amendment to our Constitution—on 
June 4, 1919. 
I ask unanimous consent to include 
in the RECORD a joint editorial that I 
wrote with my colleague and friend, 
Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska, talking 
about why it is time to finally ratify 
the ERA. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2019] 
IT’S TIME TO FINALLY PASS THE EQUAL RIGHTS 
AMENDMENT 
(By Ben Cardin and Lisa Murkowski) 
Men and women should be treated equally 
under the law. It seems pretty basic, right? 
As we approach the 100th anniversary of 
women’s suffrage, it comes as a shock to so 
many that the U.S. Constitution does not 
guarantee women the same rights and pro-
tections as men. 
We come from different ends of the polit-
ical spectrum, but we agree that this needs 
to change. Women compose a majority of the 
American population but continue to be 
underrepresented in government, elected of-
fice, the courts and business world. A level 
playing field should not be a euphemism but 
rather a reality for women (and men) from 
Anchorage to Annapolis and everywhere in 
between. 
‘‘Equality of rights under the law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any State on account of sex.’’ 
This is the full substance of the Equal 
Rights Amendment. It’s a little less than a 
tweet, but it will make a positive difference 
in the lives of millions of women. 
Why is this still necessary? During a 2011 
interview, Justice Antonin Scalia summed 
up the need for an Equal Rights Amendment. 
He said: ‘‘Certainly the Constitution does 
not require discrimination on the basis of 
sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. 
It doesn’t.’’ 
On the other side of the spectrum, Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg laid out the rationale 
for the ERA in simple terms: ‘‘Every con-
stitution written since the end of World War 
II includes a provision that men and women 
are citizens of equal stature. Ours does not.’’ 
Why has it taken this long? Per the Con-
stitution, an amendment must be ratified by 
three-fourths of the states to be enacted. 
While most amendments are put forward 
without a time limit, this one came with a 
seven-year deadline. The original was ex-
tended to 10 years, but still, only 35 States 
had ratified the ERA by 1982. 
While the clock stood frozen at the federal 
level, today, nearly half of the States—in-
cluding 
Maryland 
and 
Alaska—have 
a 
version of the ERA written into their con-
stitutions. Gender-based equality represents 
the present-day views of the vast majority of 
people across the United States, and is the 
spirit that underpins our bipartisan legisla-
tion. 
The deadline passed in 1982, so isn’t this ef-
fort futile? Not at all. 
Nationally, momentum began to shift 
about two years ago, as women across the 
country began to raise their voices again in 
calls for solidarity and equality. The ERA 
had never gone away, but the #Me Too move-
ment gave it a jolt of energy and a new spot-
light for inequalities in U.S. law. 
In March 2017, 45 years to the day after 
Congress overwhelmingly approved the ERA, 
Nevada became the 36th state to ratify the 
amendment. And then, in May 2018, Illinois 
became the 37th. 
What had for years been referred to as a 
three-state plan—working to have Congress 
remove the ratification deadline so that 
three more states could ratify the ERA, and 
it would become enshrined in our constitu-
tion—had suddenly become a one-state plan. 
Earlier this month, Virginia started the 
ratification process in their state legisla-
ture. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina 
and Utah could also become state No. 38. 
Congress can do its part by explicitly remov-
ing the deadline it once set. 
Article V of the Constitution contains no 
time limits for ratification of amendments. 
The states finally ratified the 27th Amend-
ment in 1992 regarding congressional pay 
raises more than 200 years after Congress 
proposed it in 1789 as part of the Bill of 
Rights. 
The original deadline for ERA ratification 
was not in the amendment itself but only in 
the text of the joint resolution proposing the 
amendment. This is to say the amendment 
itself has no arbitrary deadline attached. 
Whether on purpose or not, Congress hand-
cuffed itself at the time it passed the ERA. 
But this Congress can and should easily 
amend that language to remove the deadline 
for ratification. 
We are proud to work together on a bipar-
tisan basis to move this essential legislation 
over the finish line and finally make the 
ERA part of the Constitution—guaranteeing 
equality under the law for women. 
Women should not be held back or provided 
less opportunity, respect or protections 
under the law because of their gender. This 
is not a partisan issue but one of universal 
human rights. Gender equality should be an 
explicit, basic principle of our society.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Alas-
ka for her eloquent remarks, and I am 
glad I was here to have a chance to lis-
ten to them, both on equal rights, real-
ly, for all Americans. It is not possible 
for us to speak on any subject today 
without recognizing what is going on 
in the country. 
A couple of comments that come to 
my mind as I think what happened as a 
result of the incident with George 
Floyd in Minneapolis were, first, the 
comment of the leader of the peaceful 
protest in Nashville. There were more 
than 1,000 there. She said, the next day, 
that she was disappointed by the riot-
ers and looters because they dishon-
ored the memory of George Floyd and 
dishonored the peaceful protest against 
racial discrimination. I thought she 
said that well and expressed the feeling 
of most Tennesseans. 
The other comment I thought about 
was that of our colleague Senator TIM

S2721 
June 4, 2020 
SCOTT of South Carolina, who is one of 
three African-American Members of 
the U.S. Senate. He told us a couple of 
years ago in a private Bible study—and 
I asked him later if I could mention 
it—that he was stopped 7 times—an Af-
rican-American man—in his hometown, 
Charleston, SC, for being a Black man 
in the wrong place, even while he was 
the vice mayor of his hometown. 
I asked him about that again this 
week. He said: Yes, it happened again 
last month. I think most of us don’t 
know that. We don’t think about that— 
those of us who aren’t African Amer-
ican, aren’t Black. To think about 
that, I think, helps us begin the proc-
ess of understanding the feelings that 
are going on in the country right now, 
most of which can’t be solved by laws. 
They will have to be changed by atti-
tudes. 
f 
GOING BACK TO COLLEGE SAFELY 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to make com-
ments on two other subjects. The first 
is about a subject that is concerning 
about 70, 75 million American families; 
that is, going back to college and going 
back to school. The question is on the 
minds of many Americans: Will we be 
going back to college? Will our chil-
dren be going back to school? 
We finished a hearing today—the 
Presiding Officer was present; the Sen-
ator from Alaska was present—on 
going back to college safely. The ques-
tion is not whether we are going back 
to college in the United States of 
America; the question is how to go 
back safely. We all understand that 
when 70, 75 million students go back to 
college and go back to school, that is 
the surest sign that American life is re-
gaining its rhythm—not just for the 
students themselves but, especially 
with the children, for their parents, 
most of whom work outside the home. 
Today’s subject was about college. 
We had excellent witnesses. We had 
Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue 
University. He was introduced by the 
Senator from Indiana. We had the 
president of Brown University, Chris-
tina Paxson. We had Logan Hampton, 
who was president of a small histori-
cally Black college in Jackson, TN, 
Lane College. And we had the Presi-
dent of American Public Health Asso-
ciation, Dr. Benjamin. They talked 
with us about the various strategies 
and concerns that existed. 
I will, in a few minutes, ask consent 
to put my opening statement in the 
RECORD, but if I can summarize it, it 
would be this. Most of our 6,000 public 
colleges and universities—some public, 
some private, some church schools— 
will be open in August for in-person 
students but not all of them. The Uni-
versity of California State system has 
said so far that it expects only to offer 
online courses. But at Purdue, for ex-
ample—an institution of 55,000 stu-
dents—President Daniels has decided, 
with the approval of his board, and 
President Paxson of Brown—a different 
kind of institution in the Northeast, 
different from Purdue—they both de-
cided it is their obligation to open up 
and to create a safe environment for 
the students to come back. 
There are several reasons for this. 
There is some health risk in coming 
back. Of course, wise leadership can ad-
dress that. But I think, as all of us 
have looked at our colleges, wise lead-
ership can make colleges among the 
safest communities to live and work in 
America over the next year because 
colleges have certain advantages. In 
the first place, most of the campus 
community is young. While we can’t be 
cavalier about the effect of COVID–19 
on young people, as Dr. Fauci has 
warned us, the fact is that COVID–19 
seems to hurt the young much less. 
The second reason it would be easier 
to go back to college is that there is a 
lot of space in colleges that isn’t used. 
Colleges are the most notorious wast-
ers of space in our society. It is rare 
that a class is taught in the early 
morning or late evening or on Satur-
days or in the summers. There is plen-
ty of time and plenty of space to spread 
out on most college campuses. 
As we learn more and more about 
COVID–19, it looks like there are three 
things we really need to do: Keep 6 feet 
apart, wash our hands, and wear a 
mask. Do those three things, and we 
can probably go back to school, back to 
work, out to eat, and do most of the 
things we would like to do. 
At a college, as President Daniels 
says, he intends to develop a culture of 
masks. Vanderbilt University is going 
to require a mask to be worn in all in-
door situations. Then they are taking a 
number of other steps. Concerts and 
parties and large gatherings are out. 
Flu shots and grab-and-go meals are in. 
There will be systematic testing, and 
testing will be done in different ways. 
The president of Brown would like to 
test every student, she said in an arti-
cle in the New York Times a few weeks 
ago. 
The president of Purdue said: Well, 
maybe systematic testing. There will 
be different strategies for testing, but 
the goal of testing is two things. One is 
containing the disease; that is, identi-
fying the sick and the exposed so that 
they can be quarantined so the rest of 
us don’t have to be, and the other is to 
build confidence. 
I know that when I took a test last 
week after I was exposed to COVID–19, 
I went home for 2 weeks of self-isola-
tion, as the attending physician said I 
should do. That should have been it, 
but I went to my local public health 
department and took a test, which 
turned out to be negative, for peace of 
mind. It gave me more confidence to go 
back home and be with my family. 
The anticipation is that there will be 
plenty of testing. Admiral Giroir, the 
Assistant Secretary of Public Health, 
has told our committee, we are, in the 
United States, doing about 10 million 
tests a month now. States are submit-
ting to the Federal Government a plan 
each month about their testing needs. 
The Federal Government is helping fill 
in any gaps. Over the next 2, 3 months, 
the number of tests will go from about 
10 million a month to 40 or 50 million 
tests a month. That is a lot of tests. We 
are already testing more than any 
country in the world. 
My guess is that colleges and univer-
sities—even though there are 6,000 of 
them, 127 different institutions in Ten-
nessee—if they will be in touch with 
their Governor and be a part of the 
State testing plan, they can have ade-
quate tests, not only to contain the 
disease and isolate those who should be 
isolated but to give peace of mind to 
other students and faculty and mem-
bers of the community who come on-
board. 
Finally, we talked a little bit about 
the role of the Federal Government. We 
have a classic discussion about that 
here. Some want to say Washington 
should do it; some want to say the 
State should do it. Generally, our 
friends on the Democratic side trust 
Washington, DC; generally, we on the 
Republican side trust the States. But 
there is a role for both. The Federal 
Government, through the Centers for 
Disease Control, can provide advice. 
The Federal Government, as it is doing 
through the Shark Tank, as we call it, 
at the National Institutes of Health, 
can accelerate the number of rapid 
tests that are available at a low cost 
for campuses. 
The Federal Government can provide 
additional funding for campuses, as we 
did in the CARES Act. Those are some 
of the things we can do from here. But 
the things we ought not to try to do 
from here are to order California to 
open its campuses if California doesn’t 
want to or to tell Purdue and Notre 
Dame and Brown and the University of 
Tennessee and Vanderbilt that they 
cannot open their campuses if they do 
want to and think they can do it safe-
ly. We should not be trying to tell each 
of those campuses exactly how many 
tests they have, what kind of tests 
they have, any more than we try to tell 
them what the faculty ought to be paid 
or what student admissions policies 
ought to be or what the curriculum 
ought to be. 
While the Federal Government needs 
to create an umbrella in which indi-
vidual campuses can go back to school 
safely, we need to be careful about tell-
ing everybody exactly what to do. 
We had a very big event here 4, 5 
years ago when we fixed No Child Left 
Behind. Everybody wanted it fixed— 
Democrats, Republicans, labor unions, 
Governors, teachers. Why? Because 
after a while, everybody got tired of 
Washington, DC, telling 100,000 public 
schools exactly what to do, what teach-
ers to hire, what curriculum to have— 
all of these things. The same is true 
with our colleges. 
Our system of colleges and univer-
sities is the best in the world. Every-
one concedes that. It has not gotten

there by Washington ordering what it 
should do, and Washington shouldn’t 
order what it should do about this dis-
ease. It should advise; it should help; it 
can help send money. But the auton-
omy of each campus ought to be re-
spected. 
One other thing about the colleges 
and universities have asked for from us 
is liability protection. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD following my re-
marks a letter from the American 
Council on Education, with a number 
of things in it they ask of Congress. 
This is the umbrella organization for 
hiring education, and it includes liabil-
ity protection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION, 
June 3, 2020. 
Hon. LAMAR ALEXANDER, 
Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Hon. PATTY MURRAY, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ALEXANDER AND RANKING 
MEMBER MURRAY: On behalf of the American 
Council on Education and the undersigned 
higher education associations, I am writing 
to thank you for holding today’s hearing ex-
amining the important issue of how U.S. col-
leges and universities can reopen their phys-
ical campuses in the fall as the nation seeks 
to recover from the COVID–19 pandemic and 
begin returning to normal. 
The issues involved with safely welcoming 
students, faculty, and staff back to campuses 
are complicated; there is no one-size-fits-all 
solution. Every institution is developing 
plans 
appropriate 
for 
their 
own 
cir-
cumstances and the needs of their campus 
community, based on the guidance and re-
sources available from federal, state, and 
local public health officials. For example, 
while residential campuses need to carefully 
consider protocols to minimize the risks for 
students living in close proximity to one an-
other, commuter campuses must be cog-
nizant of students who move between cam-
pus, home, and work on a daily basis—and 
some campuses must address both sets of 
issues. Every campus wants to offer as full a 
range as possible of academic, housing, so-
cial, athletic, and other programs and serv-
ices, and to do so in a way that ensures as 
best as possible the safety and health of stu-
dents and all other members of the campus 
and surrounding community. In addition to 
these challenges, we know that students will 
be coming back to campus with significant 
financial challenges as they and their fami-
lies are not immune from the broader eco-
nomic conditions facing our nation. Colleges 
and universities, while under financial strain 
themselves, will redouble their efforts to 
support students who are most in need. 
Effectively and safely reopening campuses 
is constrained by the large revenue losses 
and significant new expenses that colleges 
and universities have already experienced 
and will continue to face. These expenses in-
clude the costs associated with moving in-
struction online, serving students remotely, 
and implementing new health protections 
and safety precautions. Estimates by ACE 
and other organizations have repeatedly con-
cluded that institutions of higher education 
have already lost tens of billions of dollars 
via diminished revenues and increased costs 
in the current academic year. Surveys and 
data indicate that the next academic year 
will be far worse. In addition, some states 
have already substantially cut funding to 
public universities and to student grant pro-
grams at all institutions, while for others, 
the cuts are looming. 
Understandably, implementing widespread 
testing, contact tracing, and quarantine and 
treatment facilities will impose substantial 
ongoing expenses, beyond the already sizable 
challenges in procuring and providing the ex-
tensive 
amounts 
of 
physical 
protective 
equipment and making the physical modi-
fications to campus buildings that will be 
necessary to ensure the health and safety of 
our students, staff, and visitors. We are 
happy to share with the committee a list ex-
amples of individual institutional losses, 
based on public reports, demonstrating the 
enormous 
range 
and 
variations 
in 
cir-
cumstances that will dramatically com-
plicate the ability of many campuses to re-
open. Institutions are not asking for the fed-
eral government to make them whole, but 
they need support if they are to have any 
chance at returning to something resembling 
normal operations. 
While institutions will be taking extensive 
measures such as those noted above in com-
bination with campus-specific public health 
education programs and outreach—encour-
aging safety measures such as the wearing of 
masks, hand washing, and social distancing 
and expecting shared responsibility for be-
havior—it will be impossible to completely 
eliminate the transmission of this highly 
contagious virus. It is not only possible, but 
perhaps even likely, that any campus re-
opening will result in some COVID–19 infec-
tions within the campus community. 
As a result, institutions are facing enor-
mous uncertainty about COVID–19-related 
standards of care and corresponding fears of 
possible litigation, even when they have em-
ployed reasonable decision-making and done 
everything within their power to keep stu-
dents, employees, and visitors as safe as pos-
sible. In addition to providing critical finan-
cial support for institutions that have been 
hard-hit during this crisis, we believe Con-
gress should pass legislation providing a 
timely, temporary, and targeted federal safe 
harbor from liability for illness or the spread 
of illness when good faith efforts are made to 
comply with applicable local, state, and fed-
eral public health standards. These protec-
tions should preserve recourse for those 
harmed by truly bad actors who engage in 
egregious misconduct or gross negligence. 
Thank you again for your willingness to 
examine these important issues during to-
day’s hearing. We look forward to working 
with you and your colleagues on this urgent 
matter. 
Sincerely, 
TED MITCHELL, 
President.

OPENING STATEMENT 
COVID–19: GOING BACK TO COLLEGE SAFELY— 
THURSDAY, JUNE 4 AT 10 A.M. 
Introduction 
The question for administrators of 6,000 
colleges and universities is not whether to 
reopen in August, but how to do it safely. 
Most are working overtime to get ready for 
one of the surest signs that American life is 
regaining its rhythm: 20 million students 
going back to college 
Our witnesses today are here to tell us 
their strategies for reopening safely: 
Mitch Daniels, President of Purdue Univer-
sity, West Lafayette, IN 
Christina Paxson, President of Brown Uni-
versity, Providence, RI 
Logan Hampton, President of Lane Col-
lege, Jackson, TN 
Georges Benjamin, MD, Executive Director 
of American Public Health Association, 
Washington, DC 
College best health practices 
Purdue University, the University of South 
Carolina, Rice University, Creighton Univer-
sity, and The University of Notre Dame will 
finish in-person classes before Thanksgiving 
to avoid further spread of COVID–19 during 
flu season 
Vanderbilt will require face masks in 
classrooms. 
To make social distancing easier, colleges 
are rescheduling classrooms usually empty 
in early mornings, evenings, weekends and 
summer. Concerts and parties are out. Grab 
and go meal options, flu shots and tempera-
ture checks are in. Campuses will offer more 
online courses. 
I recently was on a phone call with about 
90 presidents of Tennessee’s 127 institutions 
of higher education, and almost all of them 
are planning to resume in-person classes in 
the Fall, but they want governments to cre-
ate liability protection against being sued if 
a student becomes sick. 
Bucking the trend, California’s state uni-
versity system will offer most of its courses 
only online. 
College testing strategies 
All roads back to college lead through test-
ing. 
The availability of widespread testing will 
allow colleges to track and isolate students 
who have the virus or have been exposed to 
it, so the rest of the student body doesn’t

have to be quarantined. Campuses are ex-
ploring using mobile phone apps for tracking 
and creating isolation dormitories to isolate 
students who have the virus or have been ex-
posed, as UT-Knoxville is doing. 
Widespread testing not only helps contain 
the disease; it builds confidence that the 
campus is safe. Fortunately, U.S. Assistant 
Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir 
says there will be 40–50 million tests avail-
able per month by September. That is 4–5 
times today’s number—and today’s number 
is twice as many as any other country. 
Dr. Francis Collins, who led the Human 
Genome Project, now leads a competitive 
‘‘shark tank’’ enterprise at the National In-
stitutes of Health to discover new ways to 
conduct tens of millions of additional accu-
rate tests with quick results. 
Should everyone on campus be tested? On 
a webinar for institutes of higher education 
on Friday, May 29, Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention officials said that they 
are not recommending that at this time and 
encouraged campuses to work with their 
state and local health officials. 
However, that does not take into account 
testing for peace of mind. Some schools may 
want to test everyone before they come back 
to campus. 
Schools may want to think about testing 
randomly to detect asymptomatic cases and 
have the ability to test everyone in certain 
categories: health care, food service, and 
cleaning workers; older faculty; students 
with medical conditions or who are arriving 
from virus hot spots; all students in a class 
or dormitory where a person tests positive 
for the virus. 
Administrators ask: Where will I find 
tests? The answer is, consult your local 
health department and your governor. Each 
state submits a monthly plan to the federal 
government outlining testing supplies and 
needs. Admiral Giroir’s team then helps fill 
the gaps. 
My 
recommendation: 
you 
want 
your 
school’s testing needs to be in your state 
plan. A school can also contract directly 
with laboratories who conduct tests, review 
the Food and Drug Administration list of au-
thorized tests, or ask for help from a nearby 
large university or hospital that has created 
its own test. 
COVID–19 plans should last for at least the 
full school year. The government is pursuing 
vaccines at warp speed, but no one expects 
one by August. In the second semester there 
should be more tests, more treatments, bet-
ter contact tracing and vaccines—amidst the 
flu season and the return of COVID–19. It will 
be the Fall of 2021 before school life ap-
proaches normal. 
But students returning in the Fall and 
their families will want and need to have 
peace of mind that they, and their loved 
ones, are heading back into a safe environ-
ment. Testing is the key to providing this 
peace of mind. 
College Environment—the Good and Bad 
There are several reasons colleges have an 
advantage in providing a safe environment 
for students and faculty: 
The first reason is that younger people 
have been less hurt by COVID–19. 
For example: In Tennessee, nursing homes 
account for around 5 percent of cases of 
COVID–19 
infections 
but 
36 
percent 
of 
COVID–19 deaths. 
Compare that with Tennesseans under the 
age of 30, who have accounted for around 30 
percent of cases of infection, but less than 1 
percent of deaths. 
Still, there is much we are still learning 
about the virus, and Dr. Anthony Fauci has 
warned against ‘‘cavalierly’’ assuming that 
young people are not at risk. 
Second: Colleges are notorious wasters of 
space. As I wrote for Newsweek in 2009 to en-
courage colleges to embrace 3-year degrees: 
Former George Washington University presi-
dent Stephen J. Trachtenberg estimates that 
a typical college uses its facilities for aca-
demic purposes a little more than half the 
calendar year. ‘‘While college facilities sit 
idle, they continue to generate maintenance, 
energy, and debt-service expenses that con-
tribute to the high cost of running a col-
lege,’’ he has written. 
Keeping students six feet apart will be a 
lot easier if colleges embrace a new effi-
ciency and use more of their classrooms and 
spaces throughout the day and throughout 
the year. 
Maybe that’s a lesson that will last beyond 
this virus crisis. 
Third, tracking and tracing the virus will 
be easier to do at colleges—we know what 
classes students attend, and what dorms 
they live in. If colleges take it a step further 
and, for example, assign seats in class, infec-
tions will be even easier to track. 
Fourth, a college can require students to 
wear masks. Campuses can make mask-wear-
ing part of the student culture. 
But college environments pose a couple of 
challenges as well. 
First, we know that 19 and 20-year-olds 
don’t always choose to do what’s healthiest. 
For example, the 2018 National Survey on 
Drug Use and Health found that a third of 
college students admitted to binge drinking 
in the past month. So a social-distanced, 
mask-wearing culture in class may not al-
ways extend into the evenings and weekends. 
And second, 86 percent of undergraduate 
students are not living on campus, according 
to the National Center for Education Statis-
tics. That statistic includes big variations: 
40 percent of students at private 4-year col-
leges live on campus; 26 percent at public 4- 
year institutions, 2 percent live on campus 
at community colleges. Nearly half of under-
graduates live within 10 miles of campus. 
That means many students will leave and re-
turn, potentially exposing themselves and 
others 
to 
the 
virus—making 
social 
distancing and CDC-recommended health 
status checks all the more important. 
Federalism 
What should the federal government’s role 
be in helping colleges and universities safely 
reopen? 
Providing advice from the CDC about best 
practices 
Funding for innovation, such as the shark 
tank I mentioned, so there’s an ample supply 
of rapid tests for colleges 
Encouraging colleges and universities to 
work with states and get included in their 
testing plans, and then help states get sup-
plies they need for testing 
Funding, such as the nearly $14 billion in 
CARES Act to address lost revenue due to 
COVID–19 and help students disrupted by the 
crisis 
Federal government can provide liability 
protections 
Beyond that, decisions should be left to the 
individual campuses. From small technical 
institutes like Lincoln College of Tech-
nology to research institutions like the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology. From 
community colleges to tuition-free, four- 
year institutions like Berea College in Ken-
tucky. 
When I became a university president in 
1988, I asked the president of the University 
of California System, David Gardner, what 
made that university so good. His first an-
swer was autonomy—that the government 
provides students with funds that follow 
them to the school of their choice and then 
allows the institutions to run themselves. 
The United States is home to 6,000 colleges 
and universities—arguably the best system 
of higher education in the world because in-
stitutions have maximum autonomy and 
minimum direction from Washington on ev-
erything from their curriculum, tuition, ad-
mission policies, health care plans for stu-
dents, and compensation for faculty. They 
determine what their policies will be for stu-
dent behavior and conduct, housing, safety, 
and a host of other things. 
So I would suggest we honor that same tra-
dition now: President Trump and Congress 
should not be telling the California State 
University System that it has to open its 
classes in person, or telling Notre Dame it 
cannot—or telling UT that it must test ev-
eryone on the campus or telling Brown Uni-
versity that it cannot. Colleges themselves, 
not Washington DC, should make those deci-
sions. 
Conclusion 
We know that a single lost year of college 
can lead to a student not graduating from 
college and set back career goals. 
Already, disruption of university research 
projects has erased much of the progress 
that was being made with the record levels 
of research funding Congress has provided 
over the past five years. Many American col-
leges—overall considered the best in the 
world—will be permanently damaged or even 
closed if they remain, in witness Christina 
Paxson’s words, ‘‘ghost towns.’’ 
Two thirds of college students want to re-
turn to campus, according to an Axios sur-
vey. At Purdue, tuition deposits by incoming 
freshmen broke last year’s record. Colleges 
and universities are microcities. College 
presidents and administrators can make 
them among the safest small communities in 
which to live and work during this next year. 
In doing so, they will help our country take 
its surest step toward normalcy. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Next week in our 
committee we will take a look at going 
back to school safely, K–12. That is a 
lot more families—20 million college 
students, 75 million children in K–12. 
And in every one of those families, in 
every one of those homes, I can tell 
you those families are worried about 
whether those children can go back to 
school and whether they can go safely. 
I believe they can, and all across the 
country, Governors, classroom teach-
ers, mayors, principals are working, 
just as we heard today from the college 
presidents, to make sure they go back 
safely.

GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I 
may switch gears to another subject, 
briefly—on Monday, the Senate will be 
casting the most important vote on 
conservation legislation, outdoors leg-
islation, that we have had in 50 years. 
That is quite a statement to make be-
cause we do lots of legislation in the 
U.S. Senate. I am not exaggerating 
when I say that. This is a piece of legis-
lation that will do more for our public 
Federal lands—our national parks, our 
fish and wildlife lands, our Bureau of 
Reclamation Lands, the lands that 
hunters and fishermen use—than any 
piece of legislation we have passed in 
at least 60 years. In addition, it will 
create permanent funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2724 
June 4, 2020 
has been a goal of Congress since it was 
passed first in 1964 and reaffirmed by 
Reagan’s 
Commission on American 
Outdoors, which I chaired in 1985 and 
1986. Finally, we are getting around to 
doing both of those things. 
This piece of legislation that I am de-
scribing has the strong support of 
President Trump. In fact, it couldn’t 
happen without President Trump be-
cause the Office of Management and 
Budget has to approve the method of 
funding we are using. They have ap-
proved it, and it is in the President’s 
budget. It has the support of 59 cospon-
sors in this body—Democrats and Re-
publicans—who are working together 
on it in a remarkable way. 
People say that we are divided. Well, 
we are in lots of ways, but in other 
ways we are not. Ask Senators BURR, 
CANTWELL, DAINES, GARDNER, HEINRICH, 
KING, MANCHIN, PORTMAN, and WARNER. 
They are all in the middle of this. They 
will all take credit for it, and I will 
give them credit for it. But everyone 
recognizes it takes all of us. 
Why are we all in the middle of it? 
We have more than 800 sportsmen and 
outdoors groups who have endorsed 
this bill—more than 800. You tell me 
the 
last 
time 
you 
saw 
President 
Trump, 800 outdoors environmental 
groups, and 59 U.S. Senators on both 
sides of the aisle in favor of a piece of 
legislation that has a policy of what I 
believe is the most important piece of 
outdoors legislation in a half century. 
Here is what we are talking about. 
We are talking about leaky roofs. We 
are talking about access roads with 
potholes. We are talking about trails 
that are worn out so you slip and fall 
down when you go to hike. We are talk-
ing about sewage systems that are bro-
ken, shutting down whole campgrounds 
like the Chilhowee Mountain Camp-
ground, which was shut for 2 years. 
Five hundred families usually use it 
every summer and can’t go because the 
sewage system is shut down. We are 
talking about dilapidated visitors cen-
ters, from Washington, DC, to Pearl 
Harbor. We are talking about the Mall 
in Washington, DC. We are talking 
about our national treasures. We are 
talking about where we like to go. 
One of the organizations supporting 
this—or a group of them—represents 55 
million fishermen and hunters. They 
would like to have roads in order to get 
to the fishing holes. They would like 
not to break the axles on their tires 
along the way. Families would like to 
be able to go to Pearl Harbor and see a 
good visitors’ center, and they would 
like to be able to camp in the Smoky 
Mountains and find that it is not shut 
down because the bathrooms don’t 
work. That is what we are talking 
about here. This isn’t exotic stuff, but 
it is what creates an environment for 
us to use this great American outdoors 
that we all love. 
Now, briefly, exactly how does it do 
that? Well, one part simply says that 
we are going to take the 419 national 
park properties—the national forests, 
the National Wildlife Refuges, the Bu-
reau of Land Management, and the Bu-
reau of Indian Education—that is the 
Indian schools—and we are going to 
take the deferred maintenance, which 
is all of those things I talked about 
that are broken, and over the next 5 
years, we are going to pay for half of it. 
We have about $12 billion in deferred 
maintenance, and over the next 5 
years, we will reduce it to half of that. 
In the Great Smoky Mountains, for 
example, which is next to where I live, 
we have $235 million worth of deferred 
maintenance, and the park has a $20 
million-a-year budget. Now, how long 
do you think it is going to take, with 
a $20 million annual budget, to deal 
with $230 million worth of deferred 
maintenance? It is never going to hap-
pen. It is never going to happen with-
out this piece of legislation or some-
thing like it. That is the first part. 
President Trump, to his credit, said 
to go ahead and put in the bill the na-
tional forests, the National Wildlife 
Refuges, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation. We have a lot of Indian schools 
in this country that are broken down 
and need to be fixed. He said to put 
that in there. There are also a lot of 
Tribal nations and a lot of hunters and 
fishermen who appreciate that support, 
which is why we have 800 different out-
door groups that are supporting it. 
Then there is a second part of the 
bill—the smaller part—which is the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. It 
is a very simple idea that was rec-
ommended 
by 
President 
Johnson’s 
Rockefeller division in 1964. It said 
this: Let’s set aside a certain amount 
of money every year—$900 million. Half 
will go to the States, and half will go 
to the Federal Government and buy 
land that ought to be protected. It 
might be a city park or it might be an 
inholding in a national park. It could 
be either of those things. This has been 
going on all that time. Yet what the 
agreement was in 1964 was that we 
would get the money from offshore 
drilling in order to pay for it. We would 
create an environmental burden—that 
is, allow offshore drilling—and we 
would use it for an environmental ben-
efit, which is the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. That made a lot of 
sense. 
So, every year, Congress has appro-
priated a certain amount of money for 
that, but the idea was that the amount 
would be certain. It would be $900 mil-
lion every year, and that has never 
happened. In 1985 and 1986, President 
Reagan appointed a commission to 
look at the American outdoors. I was 
the chairman of it. The principal rec-
ommendation was to make the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund perma-
nent and have permanent funding. So, 
for 60 years, Presidents and Congresses 
have been trying to do this, but it 
hasn’t gotten done. Monday is the day 
to get it done. 
My hope is that all Members of the 
U.S. Senate will be back here for votes 
on Monday. Some of us have been a lit-
tle delinquent in our attendance on the 
Monday votes, but we need 60 votes on 
Monday to advance the bill. Then we 
will need 60 votes a couple of more 
times to pass the bill. Then it can go to 
the House of Representatives where an 
identical bill has been introduced. 
To me, it would seem that a bill like 
this, at a time like this, would be 
something we would all welcome and 
want to support. There is nothing any 
of us wants to do more than to get out-
side of our homes and get in the fresh 
air, and these lands are where we go. 
Some of them are city parks, and some 
of them are big parks, like Yellowstone 
and Yosemite and the Great Smokies. 
Yet they are our treasures, and they 
are run down. They are run down. The 
bathrooms leak. The sewage systems 
have closed camp grounds. In some 
cases, the visitors’ centers are embar-
rassing. The roads have potholes, and 
the access roads aren’t built for the 
fishermen. This is a chance for us to 
take care of that. 
I look forward to the vote on cloture 
on Monday. I hope we get a big vote 
and send a strong signal to the Amer-
ican people that we in Congress have 
heard them and that, even in a time of 
crisis like this, we can work together 
and do important work. 
There is one more aspect to it. This 
is an infrastructure bill, and infra-
structure means lots of jobs. There are 
various 
numbers 
that 
have 
been 
thrown 
around—40,000, 
100,000—but 
anytime you spend $14 billion over 5 
years on projects that are ready to go 
in locations all over the country, espe-
cially in rural areas, it is going to help 
a country that has such a high unem-
ployment rate. This is the most impor-
tant conservation and outdoors legisla-
tion in 50 years. In addition to that, it 
is an infrastructure bill. That sounds 
like a pretty good vote for Monday. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD after my speech 
my opening statement from the hear-
ing this morning on Going Back to Col-
lege Safely as well as the letter from 
the American Council on Education. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2725 
June 4, 2020 
Tragically, the Chinese Communist 
Party responded with ruthless force, 
killing demonstrators and bystanders. 
Troops with assault rifles and tanks 
fired at demonstrators and those try-
ing to block the military’s advance 
into Tiananmen Square. Several hun-
dred to several thousand people were 
killed that day. 
China has been ruled by a brutal, au-
thoritarian regime, a communist re-
gime, since 1949. 
This regime has not changed its na-
ture, and we see that today in the 
South China Sea, Hong Kong, against 
Taiwan, and in its response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic.

REMEMBERING ITALIA MARIE 
KELLY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
Sunday, a young Iowan from Dav-
enport set out to exercise her constitu-
tional rights by peacefully protesting 
the disturbing death of George Floyd. 
But when agitators turned things vio-
lent, Italia Marie Kelly decided it was 
time to go. As she was trying to leave, 
she was struck and killed by a bullet. 
She was only 22. 
Italia was protesting against vio-
lence, but she couldn’t escape it. 
We must stand up against violence, 
racism and abuses by law enforcement. 
We must also stand up against those 
who hijack peaceful protests. More 
death and destruction is no way to 
honor the legacies of those lost. 
f 
REMEMBERING JEANNETTE 
PRIEBE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
am sorry to note the passing of 
Jeannette Priebe, a longtime friend 
and an instrumental part of my team 
when I was Jefferson County judge-ex-
ecutive. Jeannette was a skilled public 
servant, animated with a fierce spirit 
for our work. Today, I would like to 
pay tribute to her life and her many 
contributions to our Commonwealth. 
Jeannette’s work embodied President 
Reagan’s notion that ‘‘personnel is pol-
icy.’’ A great deal of her career was 
dedicated to putting the right individ-
uals into positions of consequence, re-
gardless 
of 
political 
affiliation. 
Jeannette became the first female per-
sonnel director of the Louisville Civil 
Service Board and later ran Jefferson 
County’s 
personnel 
office. 
Her 
unyielding diligence made local gov-
ernment more effective for the families 
we served. 
Take, for example, Jeannette’s trans-
formative impact on the city’s police 
force. To address a serious under-rep-
resentation of African Americans in 
the 
department, 
she 
intentionally 
placed a strong emphasis on giving 
qualified, minority candidates a fair 
shot. She helped create a police force 
that was more representative of the 
community it protected. 
Jeannette joined my team when I 
was the newly elected Republican judge 
surrounded on all sides by skeptical 
Democrats. Almost everything we did 
brought an uphill climb. As a result, 
my staff and I developed a deep bond 
and a collective sense of purpose. 
In professionalizing the personnel of-
fice, Jeannette never let the bureauc-
racy slow her down. She did away with 
political patronage, insisting on merit 
in the county’s policymakers. She 
knew the rules governing her position 
and used them to shake the malaise off 
local government. If I told Jeannette 
where I wanted to end up on a par-
ticular policy, she could chart the 
course to get there. She was absolutely 
critical to our accomplishments for the 
people of Jefferson County. 
There is perhaps no better example 
than the hiring of Norma Fletcher as 
the consumer protection division direc-
tor. Norma might not have been the 
conventional choice among the stack 
of 60-plus resumes. She was a 26-year- 
old attorney who had only recently 
joined 
local 
government. 
In 
Jeannette’s characteristic way, how-
ever, she saw Norma’s initiative and 
drive. Norma got the job and would 
prove an invaluable asset to Jefferson 
County over the coming years in sev-
eral important leadership roles. I am 
grateful that Jeannette recognized the 
potential of Norma and several other 
talented individuals who made our ad-
ministration better as a result. 
Jeannette’s job came with many seri-
ous responsibilities. But she never took 
herself or her colleagues too seriously. 
She was quick to break the tension 
with a joke and a smile. Her deep res-
ervoir of faith helped give us all 
strength, even on the most grueling 
days. I will warmly remember the 
times she invited me to her home for 
dinner. Jeannette was a wonderful 
cook, and I enjoyed the chance to 
spend time with her, her husband Vic-
tor, and their family. 
Throughout my career, I have been 
lucky to work with some of the most 
capable and trustworthy staff around. 
Much of my early team was directly at-
tributable to Jeannette’s influence. 
After she left the county courthouse, I 
wasn’t certain I would ever find an-
other person quite like her. Then, 
about a decade ago, Jeannette’s daugh-
ter Angie joined my staff. As my direc-
tor of State operations, Angie has been 
tireless in helping me represent Ken-
tucky in the Senate. She is so impres-
sive in her own right and a wonderful 
reflection of her mother. I am grateful 
that brilliance happens to run in this 
particular family. 
It was a sincere privilege to call 
Jeannette a friend for so many years. I 
am forever grateful for her impression 
on my life and on lives around Jeffer-
son County. I join with her family in 
remembering this remarkable Ken-
tuckian. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Mon-
day I watched the shameful scene a 
block from the White House as the 
President of the United States ordered 
U.S. Park Police, backed by the D.C. 
National Guard and following threats 
throughout the day, to use the U.S. 
military against peaceful American 
protesters so he could have his photo-
graph taken in front of St. John’s 
Church, holding a Bible. It was an ap-
palling, almost surreal, abuse of power 
that showed a flagrant disregard not 
only for our Constitution but for those 
who have devoted their lives to defend 
it. 
Several of those patriots have spoken 
out forcefully and eloquently to reject 
the President’s grotesque display of 
force and the way he has abused the Of-
fice of the Presidency, day after day, 
year after year, to stoke divisions in 
this country. I am grateful to them for 
doing so, and I want to highlight in 
particular two of those voices, former 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Admiral Mike Mullen, and former Sec-
retary of Defense Jim Mattis. In pieces, 
one published in the Atlantic and one 
released as a statement, both laid out 
an alternate vision for our country, a 
vision that so many Americans who 
were similarly outraged share and that 
I also share. 
I ask unanimous consent that these 
statements from Admiral Mullen and 
former Defense Secretary Mattis, be 
inserted in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From The Atlantic, June 2, 2020] 
I CANNOT REMAIN SILENT: OUR FELLOW CITI-
ZENS
ARE
NOT
THE
ENEMY, AND
MUST 
NEVER BECOME SO 
(By Mike Mullen) 
It sickened me yesterday to see security 
personnel—including members of the Na-
tional Guard—forcibly and violently clear a 
path through Lafayette Square to accommo-
date the president’s visit outside St. John’s 
Church. I have to date been reticent to speak 
out on issues surrounding President Trump’s 
leadership, but we are at an inflection point, 
and the events of the past few weeks have 
made it impossible to remain silent. 
Whatever Trump’s goal in conducting his 
visit, he laid bare his disdain for the rights 
of peaceful protest in this country, gave suc-
cor to the leaders of other countries who 
take comfort in our domestic strife, and 
risked further politicizing the men and 
women of our armed forces. 
There was little good in the stunt. 
While no one should ever condone the vio-
lence, vandalism, and looting that has ex-
ploded across our city streets, neither should 
anyone lose sight of the larger and deeper 
concerns about institutional racism that 
have ignited this rage. 
As a white man, I cannot claim perfect un-
derstanding of the fear and anger that Afri-
can Americans feel today. But as someone 
who has been around for a while, I know 
enough—and I’ve seen enough—to under-
stand that those feelings are real and that 
they are all too painfully founded. 
We must, as citizens, address head-on the 
issue of police brutality and sustained injus-
tices against the African American commu-
nity. We must, as citizens, support and de-
fend the right—indeed, the solemn obliga-
tion—to peacefully assemble and to be heard. 
These are not mutually exclusive pursuits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2726 
June 4, 2020 
And neither of these pursuits will be made 
easier or safer by an overly aggressive use of 
our military, active duty or National Guard. 
The United States has a long and, to be fair, 
sometimes troubled history of using the 
armed forces to enforce domestic laws. The 
issue for us today is not whether this author-
ity exists, but whether it will be wisely ad-
ministered. 
I remain confident in the professionalism 
of our men and women in uniform. They will 
serve with skill and with compassion. They 
will obey lawful orders. But I am less con-
fident in the soundness of the orders they 
will be given by this commander in chief, 
and I am not convinced that the conditions 
on our streets, as bad as they are, have risen 
to the level that justifies a heavy reliance on 
military troops. Certainly, we have not 
crossed the threshold that would make it ap-
propriate to invoke the provisions of the In-
surrection Act. 
Furthermore, I am deeply worried that as 
they execute their orders, the members of 
our military will be co-opted for political 
purposes. 
Even in the midst of the carnage we are 
witnessing, we must endeavor to see Amer-
ican cities and towns as our homes and our 
neighborhoods. They are not ‘‘battle spaces’’ 
to be dominated, and must never become so. 
We must ensure that African Americans— 
indeed, all Americans—are given the same 
rights under the Constitution, the same jus-
tice under the law, and the same consider-
ation we give to members of our own family. 
Our fellow citizens are not the enemy, and 
must never become so. 
Too many foreign and domestic policy 
choices have become militarized; too many 
military missions have become politicized. 
This is not the time for stunts. This is the 
time for leadership. 
IN UNION THERE IS STRENGTH 
(By James Mattis) 
I have watched this week’s unfolding 
events, angry and appalled. The words 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’ are carved in the 
pediment of the United States Supreme 
Court. This is precisely what protesters are 
rightly demanding. It is a wholesome and 
unifying demand—one that all of us should 
be able to get behind. We must not be dis-
tracted by a small number of lawbreakers. 
The protests are defined by tens of thousands 
of people of conscience who are insisting 
that we live up to our values—our values as 
people and our values as a nation. 
When I joined the military, some 50 years 
ago, I swore an oath to support and defend 
the Constitution. Never did I dream that 
troops taking that same oath would be or-
dered under any circumstance to violate the 
Constitutional rights of their fellow citi-
zens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op 
for the elected commander-in-chief, with 
military leadership standing alongside. 
We must reject any thinking of our cities 
as a ‘‘battlespace’’ that our uniformed mili-
tary is called upon to ‘‘dominate.’’ At home, 
we should use our military only when re-
quested to do so, on very rare occasions, by 
state governors. Militarizing our response, as 
we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a 
conflict—a false conflict—between the mili-
tary and civilian society. It erodes the moral 
ground that ensures a trusted bond between 
men and women in uniform and the society 
they are sworn to protect, and of which they 
themselves are a part. Keeping public order 
rests with civilian state and local leaders 
who best understand their communities and 
are answerable to them. 
James Madison wrote in Federalist 14 that 
‘‘America united with a handful of troops, or 
without a single soldier, exhibits a more for-
bidding posture to foreign ambition than 
America disunited, with a hundred thousand 
veterans ready for combat.’’ We do not need 
to militarize our response to protests. We 
need to unite around a common purpose. And 
it starts by guaranteeing that all of us are 
equal before the law. 
Instructions given by the military depart-
ments to our troops before the Normandy in-
vasion reminded soldiers that ‘‘The Nazi slo-
gan for destroying us . . . was ‘Divide and 
Conquer.’ Our American answer is ‘In Union 
there is Strength.’ ’’ We must summon that 
unity to surmount this crisis—confident that 
we are better than our politics. 
Donald Trump is the first president in my 
lifetime who does not try to unite the Amer-
ican people—does not even pretend to try. 
Instead he tries to divide us. We are wit-
nessing the consequences of three years of 
this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the 
consequences of three years without mature 
leadership. We can unite without him, draw-
ing on the strengths inherent in our civil so-
ciety. This will not be easy, as the past few 
days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow 
citizens; to past generations that bled to de-
fend our promise; and to our children. 
We can come through this trying time 
stronger, and with a renewed sense of pur-
pose and respect for one another. The pan-
demic has shown us that it is not only our 
troops who are willing to offer the ultimate 
sacrifice for the safety of the community. 
Americans in hospitals, grocery stores, post 
offices, and elsewhere have put their lives on 
the line in order to serve their fellow citizens 
and their country. We know that we are bet-
ter than the abuse of executive authority 
that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We 
must reject and hold accountable those in of-
fice who would make a mockery of our Con-
stitution. At the same time, we must re-
member Lincoln’s ‘‘better angels,’’ and listen 
to them, as we work to unite. 
Only by adopting a new path—which 
means, in truth, returning to the original 
path of our founding ideals—will we again be 
a country admired and respected at home 
and abroad. 
(At the request of Mr. DURBIN, the

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for June 2020. This 
is my first scorekeeping report since I 
filed the deemed budget resolution for 
fiscal year 2021 on May 4, 2020, as re-
quired by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 
2019, BBA19. The report compares cur-
rent-law levels of spending and reve-
nues with the amounts agreed to in 
BBA19. In the Senate, this information 
is used to determine whether budg-
etary points of order lie against pend-
ing legislation. The Republican staff of 
the Budget Committee and the Con-
gressional Budget Office, CBO, pre-
pared this report pursuant to section 
308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act 
(CBA). The information included in 
this report is current through June 1, 
2020. 
In general, my filing of May 4 estab-
lished the following enforceable budg-
etary levels: (1) allocations for fiscal 
year 2021 for the Committee on Appro-
priations; (2) allocations for fiscal 
years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021 
through 2030 for committees other than 
the Committee on Appropriations; (3) 
aggregate spending levels for fiscal 
year 2021; (4) aggregate revenue levels 
for fiscal year 2021, 2021 through 2025, 
and 2021 through 2030; and (5) aggregate 
levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal 
years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021 
through 2030 for Social Security. Allo-
cations and aggregates for fiscal year 
2020 were not overridden by this filing 
and continue to be enforced under the 
fiscal year 2020 deemed budget that was 
filed on September 9, 2019. 
The figures underpinning the new en-
forceable levels are based on the discre-
tionary spending limits set forth in the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 and 
CBO’s March 2020 baseline, adjusted to 
reflect legislation enacted between the 
publication of the baseline and my May 
4 filing. Enforceable figures in this fil-
ing exclude the direct budgetary ef-
fects of provisions in legislation en-
acted after the release of the baseline 
that were designated as an emergency 
pursuant to section 4112 of the fiscal 
year 2018 congressional budget resolu-
tion, H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared Tables A-G. 
Table A gives the amount by which 
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or falls below its allocations for 
budget authority and outlays under the 
fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 
deemed budget resolutions. This infor-
mation is used for enforcing committee 
allocations pursuant to section 302 of 
the CBA. To date, eight committees 
are out of compliance with their allo-
cations for fiscal year 2020, however no 
committees have breached their newly 
released allocations this cycle. 
Tables B and C provide the amount 
by which the Senate Committee on Ap-
propriations is below or exceeds the 
statutory spending limits. This infor-
mation is used to determine points of 
order related to the spending caps 
found in sections 312 and 314 of the 
CBA. The tables show that the Appro-
priations Committee is compliant with 
spending limits for fiscal years 2020 and 
2021. The figures included in Table C re-
flect advanced and permanent appro-
priations that have already been en-
acted but will become available for ob-
ligation in fiscal year 2021.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2727 
June 4, 2020 
Tables D and E display figures re-
lated to limits on the use of changes in 
mandatory programs, CHIMPs in ap-
propriations bills. These $15 billion 
limits, found in the fiscal year 2018 
budget resolution for fiscal year 2020 
and section 207 of BBA19 for fiscal year 
2021, currently show the Appropriations 
Committee in compliance. 
Tables F and G provide the amount 
of budget authority enacted for 2020 
and 2021, respectively, that have been 
designated as either for an emergency 
or for overseas contingency operations, 
OCO, pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. 
Funding that receives either of these 
designations results in cap adjustments 
to enforceable discretionary spending 
limits. There is no limit on either 
emergency or OCO spending; however, 
any Senator may challenge the des-
ignation with a point of order to strike 
the designation on the floor. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I 
am submitting CBO tables which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
Because legislation can still be en-
acted that would have an effect on fis-
cal year 2020, CBO provided spending 
and revenue reports for both fiscal year 
2020 and fiscal year 2021. This informa-
tion is used to enforce aggregate spend-
ing levels in budget resolutions under 
CBA section 311. CBO’s estimates show 
that current levels of spending for fis-
cal year 2020 exceed amounts in last 
year’s budget resolution by $68.6 billion 
in budget authority and $55.1 billion in 
outlays, 2020, Tables 1–2. Revenues are 
$114.8 billion below the revenue floor. 
As well, Social Security outlays are at 
levels assumed for 2020, while Social 
Security revenues are $16 million above 
levels assumed in budget. 
For fiscal year 2021, the current law 
levels are $1,180.0 billion and $667.8 bil-
lion in budget authority and outlays, 
respectively, below allowable levels, 
2021, Tables 1–2. This spending room 
will be spent down as regular appro-
priations bills are enacted for fiscal 
year 2021. Revenues and Social Secu-
rity levels are at the levels assumed by 
the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget. 
CBO’s report also provides information 
needed to enforce the Senate pay-as- 
you-go, PAYGO, rule, 2021, Table 3. 
This rule is enforced under section 4106 
of the 2018 budget resolution. The 
scorecard stands at zero for all enforce-
able levels consistent with the filing of 
newly deemed budget levels. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 4, 2020. Since 
that filing, no points of order have 
been raised. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = public law. 
a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2020 published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019, by the Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not 
include those items. 
c Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of P.L. 116–59), appropriated funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense) and designated those 
amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon enactment on September 27, 2019. 
d In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 
251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

REMEMBERING MILELE CHIKASA 
ANANA 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I wish to honor the life and legacy of 
Milele Chikasa Anana, who passed 
away on May 6, 2020, at the age of 86. 
An activist, businesswoman, public 
servant, 
publisher, 
mentor, 
and 
change-maker, she was a dynamic force 
in Madison for over 50 years, helping to 
shape the community for the better 
and light the torch of many young 
leaders working to improve the lives of 
the city’s African-American commu-
nity. 
Milele was born and raised in Okla-
homa, went to college in Alabama and 
Indiana, and lived in Boston before 
making Madison, WI, her home in 1968 
with her husband Jim. By that time, 
she had started a career in computer 
technology and worked for the NAACP, 
organizing in Boston for the edu-
cational rights of Black students. 
Milele continued to develop her civic 
engagement and leadership in her early 
years in Madison when she was elected 
to the Madison School Board in 1974. 
She was the first African American to 
serve on a school board anywhere in 
the State. 
In another first—also in 1974—Milele 
became the first African-American af-
firmative action officer for the city of 
Madison, a post she would hold for 5 
years. Under her determined and stead-
fast advocacy, the city made signifi-
cant changes to its hiring practices to 
better recruit and hire candidates of 
color, particularly in the police depart-
ment. She also addressed the lack of di-
versity on the city’s boards and com-
missions, bringing new perspective to 
bodies that were at the time dominated 
by White men. Milele established the 
Women’s Issues Committee and the Mi-
nority Affairs Committee, giving em-
ployees of color and female employees 
a greater voice. She was known to call 
out city leaders when she saw injustice 
or inadequate progress and kept them 
focused on the mission of her agency. 
Her impact as affirmative action office 
is far-reaching to this very day. 
Later in her career, Milele worked as 
interim director of the Madison Equal 
Opportunities Commission and was a 
founder of the Madison Black Chamber 
of Commerce, building its directory of 
Black-owned business and establishing 
Black Restaurant Week. She has been 
an active member and mentor to many 
organizations 
including 
the 
Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority Alumni Chapter, 
the Greater Madison Urban League, 
NAACP of Dane County, and Mt. Zion 
Baptist Church. 
Milele Chikasa Anana is perhaps best 
known for her leadership of UMOJA 
Magazine, 
Wisconsin’s 
oldest 
black 
magazine. From 1990 to 2018, Milele 
served as editor and publisher, growing 
it from a 2-page newsletter to a 52-page 
monthly 
publication. 
Milele 
used 
UMOJA to celebrate the accomplish-
ments and showcase the good deeds of 
Black leaders, community members, 
business owners, and youth. 
Yet, despite these significant accom-
plishments, ‘‘Ms. Milele’’ or ‘‘Mother 
Milele,’’ as many called her, will be re-
membered most dearly as a dedicated 
mentor. 
Many 
influential 
African 
Americans have credited her with dem-
onstrating the passion and persuasion 
that led to their success as leaders. 
Countless others looked to her as a role 
model who inspired them to join the 
fight for equal rights. 
While small in stature, Milele leaves 
behind an enormous legacy. As a moth-
er of 5, grandmother of 13, and great 
grandmother of 4, her character lives 
on as the matriarch of a loving family. 
Her tenacity and determination live on 
in each young person she encouraged 
and each leader she challenged to do 
better. I know I will think of Milele 
every time I see the pride of accom-
plishment in a young African-Amer-
ican woman’s eyes. 
I consider myself lucky to have 
known Milele, and I am grateful that 
the depth of her spirit will continue to 
guide Madison toward a brighter, more 
just future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JEN COCO-MOLINA 
AND JAQUELYN LARA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would 
like to have printed in the RECORD an 
article that was published in the Miami 
Herald, ‘‘These Miami special ed teach-
ers brought the party to students on 
the last day of school.’’ I commend Ms. 
Coco-Molina and Ms. Lara for their 
dedication to Florida’s students, and 
the memories they created that will 
never be forgotten. 
The material follows: 
[June 3, 2020] 
THESE MIAMI SPECIAL ED TEACHERS BROUGHT 
THE PARTY TO STUDENTS ON LAST DAY OF 
SCHOOL 
(By Colleen Wright) 
Special 
education 
teachers 
Jen 
Coco- 
Molina and Jacquelyn Lara couldn’t have 
their last day of school party at South 
Miami Senior High as usual, so they brought 
the party to their students. 
They pulled up in front of Cristin Baez- 
Alvarez’s 
apartment 
building 
blasting 
Cristin’s favorite song. From the ‘‘mobile 
party’’ in Coco-Molina’s trunk, the teachers 
pulled out a goody bag just for 15-year-old 
Cristin: M&Ms, a daisy pen, a Disney Puppy 
Dog Pals coloring book and a smile balloon 
on a stick. 
‘‘It’s a happy balloon, like you, always 
smiling,’’ said Lara. 
Cristin took the goody bag and a bite out 
of a red frosted Publix cupcake. She’s non-
verbal, but her unflinching frosting-stained 
smile said it all. And what she couldn’t ex-
press, her mother said in Spanish. 
‘‘She’s emotional. She’s afraid that when 
she goes back upstairs, she’ll start crying,’’ 
mom Cristina Baez told Lara. 
Like Coco-Molina and Lara, teachers ev-
erywhere have been adapting since the 
coronavirus pandemic catapulted them into 
online distance learning March 13. Wednes-
day was unceremoniously the last day of 
school 
for 
Miami-Dade 
County 
Public 
Schools. 
But the pair couldn’t let the school year 
end like this. Coco-Molina teaches math and 
Lara teaches English and science to 11 ninth- 
and tenth-graders with varying disabilities. 
All but one of the students they visited 
Wednesday will have a different pair of 
teachers next year. 
‘‘We’re their second moms,’’ said Coco- 
Molina. ‘‘We’re not just their teachers.’’ 
Coco-Molina’s trunk was draped with a 
green plastic tablecloth. There were tur-
quoise 
and 
pink 
paper 
lanterns, 
shiny 
streamers, and a letter board read ‘‘Enjoy 
your summer.’’ Next to the goody bags were 
cupcakes for the students, mini cupcakes for 
their families. 
TEACHERS GET A SURPRISE

teachers with a surprise of his own. His

mother made summer-themed gift bags for 
each teacher with beach bags, metal tum-
blers and makeup wipes. 
And he had assignment packets to turn in 
to each teacher. 
The 16-year-old dashed up to the car. ‘‘Hi 
miss! How you doing?’’ he said as he took a 
vanilla cupcake. ‘‘I’ve been good, miss. It’s 
been a while.’’ 
‘‘You have been an ideal student,’’ Lara 
said through tears. ‘‘I wish I could have you 
as a student for the rest of your life.’’ 
Coco-Molina couldn’t hold back, either. 
‘‘He came to us as a boy, and now he’s a 
freaking man,’’ she said. ‘‘He always needed 
our approval and now he’s so independent.’’∑

TRIBUTE TO LAYLA EICHLER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Layla Eichler of Jefferson County for 
her passion for helping others build 
better lives. 
Layla Eichler is a treatment coordi-
nator for the First Judicial District 
Treatment Court. Layla travels all 
across Montana to work with judges 
and their staff to create positive life 
changes for those who are suffering 
from substance dependency and sub-
stance abuse. 
Layla has been a passionate leader of 
her team since 2015, providing activi-
ties, resources, and kindness for par-
ticipants in her program. Most impor-
tantly, she dedicates her time building 
a community for those impacted by the 
vicious cycle of addiction. Layla sac-
rifices her personal time and money to 
create activities for participants to 
enjoy and try something new. For ex-
ample, every week she hikes a new lo-
cation with the participants. 
Since December of 2019, the number 
of graduates through her program has 
reached close to 40. The number of 
drug-free babies born has increased 
from 11 to 13. Four GEDs have been ob-
tained. Seven have enrolled in college 
or graduated. 
The lives Layla has touched have 
been made better by her unrelenting 
dedication to see her participants suc-
ceed. 
It is my honor to recognize Layla for 
her selfless efforts to support her fel-
low Montanans to build better lives for 
themselves, their families, and their 
communities.∑

RECOGNIZING THE JONES ACT 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as 
the American people continue to show 
great strength and perseverance during 
this coronavirus crisis, I would like to 
take this opportunity to highlight 
those very American ideals by com-
memorating the 100th anniversary of 
the Jones Act. 
The Jones Act has enhanced Amer-
ican prosperity and national security 
ever since its enactment on June 5, 
1920. It puts America first over sub-
sidized foreign shipbuilders and foreign 
vessel operators that do not pay U.S. 
taxes or comply with U.S. regulations. 
It continues to preserve our role as the 
world’s leader in commerce and thou-
sands of precious jobs for our American 
citizens. When it comes to the Jones 
Act, there is an overwhelming sense of 
pride from the American people, espe-
cially from Mississippians. 
Mississippi has a long and storied 
shipbuilding tradition of which we are 
very proud. Mississippi is home to mul-
tiple shipyards that continue to grow 
domestic jobs exponentially, increase 
overall positive economic impact, and 
produce a multitude of vessels to for-
tify national security and commerce. 
With more than 13,000 domestic mari-
time jobs, Mississippi ranks 15th in the 
Nation for jobs related to the domestic 
maritime industry. 
In addition, Mississippi ranks second 
nationwide in per capita shipyard jobs, 
meaning that one out of every 75 Mis-
sissippians has a job directly or indi-
rectly related to the shipyard industry. 
When looking at the total economic 
impact from domestic maritime activ-
ity, Mississippi accounts for more than 
$3 billion annually. It is sufficient to 
say Mississippi is one of many States 
that continues to reap and sow the re-
wards of the Jones Act. 
Mr. President, there are more than 
40,000 vessels in America’s domestic 
fleet, which is one of the largest in the 
world. The domestic maritime industry 
accounts for 648,220 jobs, $41.6 billion in 
labor compensation, $154.8 billion in 
economic output, $72.4 billion in value 
added, and $16.8 billion in taxes. 
The Jones Act is an integral part of 
our Nation’s success, and I am proud to 
recognize its longstanding contribu-
tions to our Nation and to advocate for 
its continued influence in the decades 
to come. ∑

THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL

A 
STRONG, RELIABLE, AND ACTIVE 
PARTNER 
IN 
THE 
SOUTHEAST 
ASIAN REGION 
Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. 
MARKEY) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 607 
Whereas cooperation between the Govern-
ments and people of the United States and 
Vietnam can help realize their common 
goals of a peaceful, prosperous, and open 
Indo-Pacific rooted in a rule-based order that 
promotes security, opportunity, and respect 
for sovereignty; 
Whereas Vietnam is serving as the 2020 
Chair for the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) under the theme of ‘‘Cohe-
sive and Responsive ASEAN’’, and will co- 
chair the U.S.–ASEAN Special Summit when 
it is rescheduled from the original planned 
March 14, 2020 date; 
Whereas Vietnam has demonstrated a will-
ingness to stand up for freedom of navigation 
and international law in the South China 
Sea and opened a new chapter in bilateral co-
operation on these shared goals; 
Whereas Vietnam deployed its first mili-
tary officers to United Nations peacekeeping 
operations in 2014, and contributed a field 
hospital to United Nations peacekeeping op-
erations in South Sudan in 2018; 
Whereas both countries have sought to as-
sist each other in accounting for the over 
1,200 Americans and as many as 300,000 Viet-
namese still missing from the Vietnam War; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has worked with the Government of Vietnam 
to remove unexploded ordnance and to treat 
victims maimed by it through funding under 
the Leahy War Victims Fund and the De-
partment of State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs Act, 2019 (division F of 
Public Law 116–6), including $15,000,000 for 
humanitarian demining operations as well as 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment (USAID) programs; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has completed the cleanup of dioxin at Da 
Nang airport, and is working with the Gov-
ernment of Vietnam of the cleanup of Bien 
Hoa airport; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has assisted the Government of Vietnam in 
strengthening its maritime capabilities, in-
cluding by providing coast guard vessels and 
assisting the Government of Vietnam in 
strengthening its maritime domain aware-
ness; 
Whereas the United States Government re-
mains committed to working with the Gov-
ernment of Vietnam on its compliance with 
international commitments and obligations 
to protect internationally recognized human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, including 
freedom of religion, expression, the press, 
and assembly, in order to advance the funda-
mental dignity of all people, a key to main-
taining 
stability, 
promoting 
economic 
growth, and strengthening good governance; 
Whereas, in the 25 years since the United 
States and Vietnam normalized diplomatic 
relations, the people of Vietnam have bene-
fited from greater prosperity and integration 
into the global economy; 
Whereas the United States and Vietnam 
signed a bilateral trade agreement in July 
2000, and granted one another permanent 
normal trade relations in 2008, ushering in a 
more than tenfold increase in trade flows in 
both directions over the past 20 years, ex-
ceeding $77,000,000,000 in 2019; 
Whereas the Governments of the United 
States and Vietnam cooperate on a range of 
public health issues, particularly combating 
HIV-AIDS under the United States Presi-
dent’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR) program, and more broadly on 
health, governance, education, infrastruc-
ture, and environmental issues through the 
Lower Mekong Initiative; 
Whereas, in 2020, Vietnam celebrates 75 
years since declaring independence; 
Whereas more than 1,800,000 Vietnamese- 
Americans have made contributions to the 
United States in a variety of fields ranging 
from law to science to defense and the arts; 
Whereas the United States hosts nearly 
30,000 young Vietnamese students, the 6th 
largest 
group 
of 
international 
students 
studying at United States universities, con-
tributing 
$1,000,000,000 
annually 
to 
the 
United States economy; 
Whereas bilateral cooperation transformed 
debts of the former South Vietnamese gov-
ernment to the United States into Fulbright 
University Vietnam, Vietnam’s first inde-
pendent, not-for-profit university; and 
Whereas sister city relationships link our 
citizens in— 
(1) Seattle, Washington and Haiphong; 
(2) Madison, Wisconsin and Bac Giang; 
(3) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Da Nang; 
(4) San Francisco, California and Ho Chi

2018 (Public Law 115–409; 132 Stat. 5407) 
that— 
(A) the promotion of human rights and re-
spect for democratic values in the Indo-Pa-
cific region is in the United States’ national 
security interest; 
(B) continued support for human rights, 
democratic values, and good governance is 
critical to a successful United States diplo-
matic strategy in the Indo-Pacific; 
(C) strong support for human rights and 
democracy in the Indo-Pacific region is crit-
ical to efforts to reduce poverty, build rule of 
law, combat corruption, reduce the allure of 
extremism, and promote economic growth; 
and 
(D) there are serious concerns with the 
rule of law and civil liberties in Vietnam, 
which has been identified by Freedom House 
as ‘‘Not Free’’; 
(5) reaffirms that it is important that Viet-
nam’s rights and interests under inter-
national law, regardless of size, power, and 
military capabilities, are respected; and

JING’S TIANANMEN SQUARE 
Mr. 
RUBIO 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. GARDNER, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Mr. DAINES, Mr. KING, Mr. SCOTT 
of Florida, Mr. PETERS, Mr. CORNYN, 
Mr. HAWLEY, and Mr. YOUNG) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 608 
Whereas 
the 
31st 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Tiananmen Square massacre is an especially 
poignant milestone, particularly as the au-
tonomy of the Hong Kong Special Adminis-
trative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China (‘‘Hong Kong’’) and freedoms guaran-
teed to the people of Hong Kong are cur-
rently under threat by possible national se-
curity legislation from the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China (‘‘China’’); 
Whereas, during the spring of 1989, an esti-
mated 1,000,000 people engaged in Tiananmen 
Square protests, and citizens in over 400 Chi-
nese cities staged similar protests, including 
among many others, students, workers, aca-
demics, journalists and government employ-
ees; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of 
1989 called upon the Government of China to 
eliminate corruption, accelerate economic 
and political reform, and protect human 
rights, particularly the freedoms of expres-
sion and assembly, issues that remain rel-
evant in United States-China relations 31 
years later; 
Whereas, on June 4, 1989, troops of the Peo-
ple’s Liberation Army, at the behest of Chi-
nese Communist Party leadership, attacked 
Tiananmen Square to repress demonstrators, 
crushing defenseless protestors with tanks 
and firing on them indiscriminately, killing 
hundreds or possibly thousands of individ-
uals; 
Whereas, since June 4, 1989, the Govern-
ment of China censors any mention of 
Tiananmen 
Square 
and 
imprisons 
and

S2737 
June 4, 2020 
harasses its own citizens who attempt to dis-
cuss or commemorate Tiananmen Square 
protests and their violent suppression; 
Whereas the Tiananmen Mothers—a group 
in China composed of parents and family 
members of individuals killed on or around 
June 4, 1989—have annually called upon the 
Government of China to reveal the truth of 
the events; 
Whereas people of mainland China and 
Macau are again barred this year from com-
memorating the lives lost and the legacy of 
the 1989 massacre; 
Whereas the Government of China con-
tinues 
to 
view 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
Tiananmen protesters, including democracy, 
transparency, rights protections, and free-
dom of speech, as threats to the legitimacy 
of the Chinese Communist Party’s hold on 
political power; 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong have 
commemorated the Tiananmen massacre 
each year faithfully in large numbers; 
Whereas the Hong Kong Police Force has 
blocked the annual candlelight vigil to com-
memorate Tiananmen this year; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s guaranteed freedoms 
and the rule of law have allowed it to be a 
prosperous bridge between mainland China 
and the world; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s autonomy and free-
doms have been eroded by the actions of the 
Government of Hong Kong and the Govern-
ment of China, particularly over the past 
several years, with disqualifications of elect-
ed members of Hong Kong’s Legislative 
Council, blocking citizens from running for 
office, failing to address the petitions of the 
Hong Kong people, banning a political party 
advocating Hong Kong independence, and 
failing to address police excessive use of 
force; 
Whereas the political turmoil in Hong 
Kong is primarily the result of actions of the 
Government of Hong Kong and the Govern-
ment of China, including the arbitrary ar-
rests of peaceful protesters, including well- 
known democracy advocates such as Martin 
Lee, Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk Yan, Margaret 
Ng, Albert Ho, Leung Kwok-hung, Au Nok- 
hin, Figo Chan, and others; 
Whereas China’s National People’s Con-
gress has decided to impose national security 
legislation with respect to Hong Kong; 
Whereas the implementation of that legis-
lation signals a severe blow to Hong Kong’s 
autonomy and would violate the Joint Dec-
laration of the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land and the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China on the Question of Hong 
Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984; 
Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, 
pursuant to the United States-Hong Kong 
Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–383), has 
determined that Hong Kong no longer mani-
fests a ‘‘high degree of autonomy’’ distinct 
from mainland China; 
Whereas vague national security laws are 
used widely in mainland China to imprison 
or arbitrarily detain dissidents, rights de-
fenders, civil society advocates, religious 
leaders and adherents, and persons from eth-
nic minorities; 
Whereas human rights, democracy, and re-
ligious freedom advocates have been impris-
oned or arbitrarily detained under vague na-
tional security laws in mainland China, in-
cluding 
Wu 
Gan, 
Qin 
Yongmin, 
Zhou 
Shifeng, Yu Wensheng, Wang Yi , and Nobel 
laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in state cus-
tody nearly three years ago; 
Whereas the United States Congress, par-
ticularly in recent years, has passed numer-
ous measures articulating the longstanding 
and bipartisan commitment to human rights 
in China, including— 
(1) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
(2) the North Korean Human Rights Reau-
thorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–198); 
(3) the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–330); 
(4) the Hong Kong Human Rights and De-
mocracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76); and 
(5) the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act 
(S. 3744, 116th Congress); 
Whereas, on this day, we stand in soli-
darity with human rights lawyers, labor and 
free speech advocates, religious groups, and 
ethnic minorities in China, such as Tibetans, 
and also Uyghurs and other predominately 
Muslim ethnic minorities who face mass in-
ternment and surveillance, forced labor and 
family separations, and who are often forced 
to renounce their faith; and 
Whereas, on this day, we remember the 
words of the late Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, 
who said there is ‘‘no force that can put an 
end to the human quest for freedom, and 
China will in the end become a nation ruled 
by law, where human rights reign supreme’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) will commemorate the Tiananmen pro-
tests and their violent repression at least 
until such time as Chinese citizens are able 
to do so freely and publicly everywhere 
across their country; 
(2) expresses sympathy to the families of 
those killed, tortured, imprisoned, or exiled 
for their participation in the pro-democracy 
demonstrations during the spring of 1989; 
(3) calls on the Government of China to 
allow those Tiananmen demonstration par-
ticipants currently living in exile in the 
United States and other countries to return 
to China without risk of repercussions or 
retribution; 
(4) condemns the use of violence, torture, 
and arbitrary detention as a means to re-
press the legitimate aspirations of the people 
of China to speak and associate freely, in-
cluding to petition the government and chal-
lenge the policies and ideology of the Chi-
nese Communist Party; 
(5) calls on the Government of China to re-
lease all prisoners of conscience, including 
prisoners detained because of their participa-
tion in Tiananmen Square commemorations 
or actions calling for the type of political re-
forms and rights protections pursued by 
those who gathered in Tiananmen Square in 
1989 and including over one million Uyghurs 
and other predominately Muslim ethnic mi-
norities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region; 
(6) condemns any forced imposition of na-
tional security legislation with respect to 
Hong Kong; 
(7) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment to use all available authorities to pro-
tect United States interests in Hong Kong 
and the freedoms of the Hong Kong people, 
including— 
(A) encouraging the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress of China 
‘‘to work with the Hong Kong [Special Ad-
ministrative Region] Government and the 
people of Hong Kong to find a mutually ac-
ceptable accommodation that will honor 
China’s international obligations under the 
UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration,’’ as 
called for by the Joint Statement of the Gov-
ernments of the United States, Australia, 
Canada and the United Kingdom; and 
(B) using all available diplomatic means 
and targeted sanctions to encourage the re-
peal of the national security legislation 
adopted by the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress of China on May 
28, 2020; 
(8) calls upon the President to encourage 
an international coalition to demand that 
China adhere to its international agreements 
and human rights obligations; and 
(9) calls upon Hong Kong Chief Executive 
Carrie Lam to allow the Hong Kong people to 
exercise their ‘‘freedoms of speech, of the 
press and of publication; freedom of associa-
tion, of assembly, of procession and of dem-
onstration,’’ as guaranteed in Article 27 of 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China.

f 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, intend 
to object to proceeding to the nomina-
tion of Mashall Billingslea, of Virginia, 
to be Under Secretary of State for 
Arms Control and International Secu-
rity dated June 4, 2020. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Marshall Billingslea, of Vir-
ginia, to be Under Secretary of State 
for Arms Control and International Se-
curity, vice Andrea L. Thompson, re-
signed (PN1732). 
Following my bipartisan letter to the 
president on April 8, 2020, regarding the 
removal of the Intelligence Community 
Inspector General (IC IG), I sent a sepa-
rate letter to the President regarding 
the removal of the Department of 
State Inspector General (State IG). My 
letter echoed the IC IG letter to the 
President and reminded him of his re-
quirement under the Inspector General 
Reform Act to provide clear reasons for 
removal of inspectors general. I also 
raised concerns regarding the inherent 
conflicts of interest created by naming 
individuals holding political positions 
within the overseen agency as acting 
inspectors general. After a delay, the 
White House promised me a response to 
both the IC IG letter and my State IG 
letter that fulfilled the statutory re-
quirement by providing substantive 
reasons 
for 
the 
removal. 
On 
the 
evening of May 26, 2020, I received a re-
sponse from the White House, but it 
contained no explanation for the re-
moval of the State IG and made no 
comment regarding the conflicts of in-
terest issues that I raised. 
Though the Constitution gives the 
president the authority to manage ex-
ecutive branch personnel, Congress has 
made it clear that should the president 
find reason to remove an inspector gen-
eral, there ought to be a good reason 
for it. The White House’s response 
failed to address this requirement, 
which Congress clearly stated in stat-
ute and accompanying reports. I don’t 
dispute the President’s authority under 
the Constitution, but without suffi-
cient explanation, the American people 
will be left speculating whether polit-
ical or self-interests are to blame. 
That’s not good for the presidency or 
government accountability. This is 
only compounded when the acting IG 
maintains 
their 
presidentially 
ap-
pointed position within the overseen 
agency. 
Further, the White House’s response 
states that the President was acting in 
a manner that comported with the 
precedent that began under the Obama 
administration. The letter states that 
the President’s letter mirrors the one 
sent by President Obama when he re-
moved IG Walpin. What that letter 
fails to mention is that President 
Obama, at the demand of myself and 
other members of this Chamber, even-
tually did send several letters explain-
ing in much greater detail the reasons 
for the removal of Mr. Walpin. They 
were inadequate responses that contin-
ually changed and eventually resulted 
in a bicameral investigation into the 
matter, but reasons were provided. 
I have attached copies of these let-
ters and the aforementioned report for 
the RECORD. I intend to maintain this 
hold until the notice requirement in 
the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 
U.S.C. app. 3(b) is met and the reasons 
for the IC IGs removal are provided.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2743 
June 4, 2020 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, intend 
to object to proceeding to the nomina-
tion of Christopher C. Miller, of Vir-
ginia, to be Director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence dated 
June 4, 2020. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Christopher C. Miller, of Vir-
ginia, to be Director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, Office of the 
Director 
of 
National 
Intelligence 
(PN1741). 
On April 8, 2020, I sent a bipartisan 
letter to the President cosigned by 
seven of my colleagues regarding the 
removal of Intelligence Community In-
spector General (IC IG) Michael Atkin-
son. That letter reminded the Presi-
dent of his requirement under the In-
spector General Reform Act to provide 
clear reasons for such removal. After a 
delay, the White House promised me a 
response to my letter that fulfilled the 
statutory requirement by providing 
substantive reasons for the removal. 
On the evening of May 26, 2020, I re-
ceived a response from the White 
House, but it contained no explanation 
for the removal of the IC IG. 
Though the Constitution gives the 
president the authority to manage ex-
ecutive branch personnel, Congress has 
made it clear that should the president 
find reason to fire an inspector general, 
there ought to be a good reason for it. 
The White House’s response failed to 
address this requirement, which Con-
gress clearly stated in statute and ac-
companying reports. I don’t dispute the 
President’s authority under the Con-
stitution, but without sufficient expla-
nation, the American people will be 
left speculating whether political or 
self-interests are to blame. That’s not 
good for the presidency or government 
accountability. 
Further, the White House’s response 
states that the President was acting in 
a manner that comported with the 
precedent that began under the Obama 
administration. The letter states that 
the President’s letter mirrors the one 
sent by President Obama when he re-
moved IG Walpin. What that letter 
fails to mention is that President 
Obama, at the demand of myself and 
other members of this Chamber, even-
tually did send several letters explain-
ing in much greater detail the reasons 
for the removal of Mr. Walpin. They 
were inadequate responses that contin-
ually changed and eventually resulted 
in a bicameral investigation into the 
matter, but reasons were provided. 
I have attached copies of these let-
ters and the aforementioned report for 
the RECORD. I intend to maintain this 
hold until the notice requirement in 
the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 
U.S.C. app. § 3(b) is met and the rea-
sons for the IC IGs removal are pro-
vided.

REMEMBERING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE TREATY OF 
TRIANON WITH HUNGARY 
HON. ANDY HARRIS 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, as Co-Chair 
of the Congressional Hungarian-American 
Caucus, I rise today on the occasion of the 
100th Anniversary of the Treaty of Trianon 
with Hungary signed on June 4, 1920, at the 
Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First 
World War. 
The non-negotiable treaty cost Hungary 
over 70 percent of her territory and one-third 
or three million of her indigenous ethnic-Hun-
garian population. For the last one hundred 
years, these ethnic Hungarian minorities have 
had to live in neighboring countries, with their 
cultural and political lives suffering at times. 
The Hungarian-American Caucus is a bipar-
tisan group of distinguished House members, 
which seeks to represent the interests of Hun-
garian American constituents; foster bilateral 
relations between Hungary, a strong NATO 
ally, and the United States; and protect the 
rights of Hungarian minorities in Europe. 
To that end, I include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing statement by the American Hungarian 
Federation, the oldest American Hungarian as-
sociation in the United States, founded in 
1906 in Cleveland, Ohio, and based in Wash-
ington, D.C., on the occasion of this 100th An-
niversary of the Treaty of Trianon.

garian Federation.

mittee.

Relations Committee. 
THE TREATY OF TRIANON: A HUNGARIAN 
TRAGEDY 
‘‘Ancient poets and theologians could not imag-
ine such suffering, which Trianon brought 
to the innocent. In their eyes, that was for 
the 
damned 
in 
Hell.’’—Sir 
Winston 
Churchill 
One hundred years ago, June 4, 1920, the 
Hungarian delegation to the Paris Peace 
Conference was forced to sign the punishing 
Treaty of Trianon, arguably the most severe 
of all the post-World War I settlements con-
cluded at the conference. Led by the Big 
Four—the United States, Great Britain, 
France and Italy—those treaties were collec-
tively designed to conclude the First World 
War and make the ‘‘world safe for democ-
racy,’’ according to President Woodrow Wil-
son. 
The ‘‘peacemakers’’ instead concocted a 
hazardous brew. The ostensible ‘‘peace’’ 
turned out to be only an armistice as World 
War II erupted merely 20 years later. Tens of 
millions of civilians and members of the 
military died in that war; the Holocaust dev-
astated the European Jewish community; a 
murderous Stalin occupied Central and East-
ern Europe; and the world was thrust into a 
costly and dangerous Cold War. Supposedly 
in the name of national self-determination, 
Trianon dismembered the thousand-year-old 
Kingdom of Hungary, a self-contained, geo-
graphically and economically coherent and 
durable formation in the Carpathian Basin, 
boasting the longest lasting historical bor-
ders in Europe. 
The resulting non-negotiable treaty cost 
Hungary over 70 percent of her territory and 
one-third or three million of her indigenous 
ethnic-Hungarian population. Add to this the 
loss of all her seaports and up to 90 percent 
of her vast natural resources, industry, rail-
ways, and other infrastructure. 
Millions of Hungarians woke up one morn-
ing and saw borders arbitrarily redrawn 
around them without plebiscites, ignoring 
Wilson’s lofty goal of national self-deter-
mination. The ‘‘absurd’’ treaty, as Wilson 
later referred to it, was never ratified by the 
United States; ignored a millennia of nation 
building and age-old cultural affiliations; 
created new and enlarged countries; and pro-
duced millions of new minorities who today 
struggle for survival of their ethnic identity. 
To this very day, Hungarian minorities 
have been subjected to discrimination, intol-
erance and violence. Schools in the successor 
states limit students from studying in their 
native 
Hungarian 
language; 
Hungarian 
church properties have been confiscated; and 
cemeteries and cultural monuments have 
been vandalized. The ‘‘peacemakers’’ did in-
sist that the new successor states, Romania, 
Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, sign various 
international instruments that included pro-
visions for the protection of minorities. But 
those promises are largely unkept. 
Despite these promises and the fact that 
Romania obtained Transylvania from Hun-
gary under Trianon—more territory than re-
mained as Hungary—Romania continues to 
ignore its obligations. Just recently in April, 
Romania’s 
president 
incited 
animosity 
against its ethnic Hungarians by making in-
flammatory statements resulting in tensions 
between Hungary and Romania, two NATO 
allies. The Hungarian historical commu-
nities in Romania, particularly the Szeklers, 
are denied a range of rights that threatens 
their very cultural existence. 
Hungarians in Serbia, Slovakia, Romania, 
and Ukraine have all requested semi-auton-
omy by peaceful and democratic means. 
Such local governance would ensure democ-
racy to beleaguered Hungarians, fulfill prom-
ises made to them one hundred years ago, 
and strengthen the democratic process by 
serving as a model of how majorities and mi-
norities can work together to redress past 
wrongs. 
Considering the far-reaching implications 
of discrimination, intolerance, and animos-
ity directed at the Hungarian minorities, the 
response from the European Union and the 
United States to date has been tepid. Strong-
er measures must be taken to remedy the on-
going abuses of minority rights that con-
travene numerous European Commission 
standards. 
Together, the European Union and United 
States must ensure that democratic prin-
ciples and international norms and practices 
relating to national minorities will finally 
prevail in Central and Eastern Europe and 
bring regional tension to a just and lasting 
end, all of which is in the strategic interests 
of the United States and the American peo-
ple. Only then will the Tragedy of Trianon be 
addressed. 
HONORING JOHN MCCALL III 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
student, Mr. John McCall III. 
John William McCall, III was born to Gladys 
and John William McCall, Jr. He is a native of 
Sidon, Mississippi, and the eldest of three sib-
lings. His two brothers are Jamarkus and 
Jeremiah McCall. 
John is a 2016 graduate of Amanda Elzy 
High School where he graduated as the salu-
tatorian of his class. Currently, he serves as a 
member of the choir and volunteer sound en-
gineer at his church, St. James Temple of De-
liverance C.O.G.I.C. in Cruger, MS. 
As a Presidential Scholar at MVSU, McCall 
is a member of the Alpha Lambda Delta 
Honor Society and was appointed as the 
chapter’s Historian. Growing up, he developed 
an interest in the arts and has continued to 
cultivate that interest throughout his matricula-
tion at MVSU. John has always been fas-
cinated with various forms of art—particularly 
film and performances by historical and mod-
ern actors. His career goal is to become a film 
director and professional actor. 
John recently graduated from Mississippi 
Valley State University as the valedictorian of 
his class with a 4.0 grade point average. He 
received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mass 
Communications with an emphasis in Broad-
casting and a minor in Business Administra-
tion. He also represented The Valley as Mister 
Mississippi Valley State University during the 
2019–2020 academic school year. 
While at MVSU, he directed and starred in 
various 
productions, 
including 
two 
short 
films—‘‘The Contrast Between a Boy and a 
Man’’ and, ‘‘Leopard Highway.’’ In addition, he 
has directed and starred in a small three-epi-
sode mini-series entitled ‘‘Fading Corners,’’ 
and has directed a music video entitled ‘‘Invis-
ible,’’ which was performed by Timothy Adams 
Jr., a cousin, good friend, and upcoming artist. 
John has starred in numerous theatrical skits 
at his church as well as MVSU, including, 
‘‘Family: An Adaptation’’ and ‘‘The New Mrs. 
Jones.’’ John said he has fallen in love with 
the power of storytelling. 
McCall aspires to live a life filled with grati-
tude. He is grateful to God for life and His di-
rection, which he finds in His Word. Moreover, 
he is grateful to his parents for all the days 
and nights they have worked hard to put food 
on the table and to ensure that he and his 
brothers are well taken care of. He is also 
thankful for the ways they’ve nurtured him 
through life and for the prayers they have sent 
up on his behalf. Lastly, he is grateful for his 
family, church, and friends for their unwaver-
ing love and support. 
Upon graduating this May 2020, John plans 
to attend graduate school to further study film-
ing and acting. John is a firm believer that

REMEMBERING DR. MARSHALL 
MITZMAN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Dr. Mar-
shall Mitzman, on the occasion of his passing 
on Tuesday, April 14, 2020. 
Born on May 23, 1946, to Moe Mitzman and 
Nellie Mitzman-Schwartz, Marshall and his 
four siblings grew up in Angola, Indiana. His 
family remembers, even as a boy, Marshall 
valued his education and worked hard to en-
sure an opportunity to continue his education 
after high school. 
Marshall made his way to California in 1964 
and landed in the Bay Area. Using his edu-
cation at Foothill College and De Anza Col-
lege as a launching pad, he obtained a bach-
elor’s degree at San Jose State University; 
but, he did not stop there. Marshall went on to 
obtain a master’s degree from Judge College, 
Cambridge University, at which he later be-
came Dr. Mitzman upon the completion of his 
doctoral program. 
Marshall would then return to California 
where he started several small businesses. He 
quickly became an integral part of the fabric of 
our community by lending his expertise to sev-
eral networks. He served as an adjunct pro-
fessor at several of our community colleges 
and held a lifetime California Community Col-
lege teaching credential. He also taught at the 
UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. The 
boards on which Marshall served are almost 
too numerous to name, but notable among 
them are the Alameda County School Board 
Association, the Hayward Education Founda-
tion, and the Friends of Chabot College Foun-
dation. 
In 2008, Marshall became a board member 
of the Chabot-Las Positas Community College 
District (CLPCCD), with which he worked to 
increase access to education in the parts of 
our community where opportunity has not 
been distributed as equally as the capability of 
our students. Marshall served on the CLPCCD 
Board of Directors until his passing. His com-
mitment to students will be among his greatest 
legacies. We’re all grateful to Marshall, for al-
ways putting the needs and education of our 
students first. 
Marshall was recovering from a brain tumor 
in one of our community’s skilled nursing facili-
ties when the cruelty of COVID–19 stole him 
from us. He is survived by his wife Felie, two 
children, and seven grandchildren. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR. 
CASSANDRA 
‘‘MELODY’’ 
MONT-
GOMERY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the hard work and service of Dr. Cas-
sandra Montgomery on behalf of the commu-
nities of Detroit. 
Over the years, Dr. Montgomery has taken 
on many roles, working in different capacities, 
but she has always remained steadfast in the 
pursuit of social justice. Dr. Montgomery first 
moved to Detroit from Alabama as a young 
child. She grew up in the beautiful city of De-
troit in its golden age of growth. She experi-
enced Motown’s musical scene and enjoyed 
her youth spent in neighborhoods where 
goods and services could be found without 
even leaving the community. Dr. Montgomery 
also witnessed Detroit in the midst of the 
1960s civil rights movement. She knew the 
pain of segregation through her childhood vis-
its to Alabama, but she also bore witness to 
one of the most important speeches delivered 
by Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at a 
speech at Cobo Hall in 1963. 
These memories instilled in Dr. Montgomery 
that social justice is a need worth fighting for, 
something she carried through in her work. Dr. 
Montgomery built the foundation of her profes-
sional life in service to others, whether in so-
cial work, advocacy, or in counseling, she was 
a friend to the people of the City of Detroit. 
Those of us who knew her in her capacity at 
People’s Community Services in Southwest 
Detroit know her particularly for her tenacity in 
preserving the culture of the neighborhood of 
Delray. 
I therefore ask you to join me in tribute to 
Dr. Cassandra Montgomery, a beautiful soul 
and fighter for justice.

HONORING ERIC THOMPSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a hardworking 
and ambitious man, Mr. Eric Thompson. Eric 
has shown what can be done through hard 
work, dedication and a desire to serve others. 
Eric Thompson is a native of Rolling Fork, 
Mississippi and a graduate of South Delta

Senior year. He made the decision to attend 
the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff major-
ing in Computer Science. 
During his years on the university’s campus, 
Mr. Thompson spent most of his time with the 
ROTC program. This interaction directly af-
fected his development as an impactful leader 
and his ability to work well with others while 
building a cohesive environment. Eric was a 
member of the Golden Lion Football Team 
while at UAPB. He worked his way into a 
starting position as a wide receiver and on 
special teams. He also became a member of 
the Gamma Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha

his Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer 
Science. 
After graduating he became a Math Teacher

that raised him. Within his first year as a 
coach, his leadership skills and his ability to 
create a TEAM approach; his students in-
creased their test scores from 21 to 69 per-
cent. He made a significant impact with his 
students on the field as well as a new coach 
taking over the reins with only one week be-
fore the season started; his team produced a

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HARD 
WORK 
AND DEDICATION OF BRANDON 
F. WEBB 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to thank my long-time Chief of Staff, 
Brandon F. Webb. 
Within months of my election to Congress, 
Brandon joined Team Kelly as my Legislative 
Director after 6 years of dedicated service to 
the people of Georgia’s 12th District as Senior 
Legislative Assistant to Congressman John 
Barrow. Shortly after arriving in my office, he 
took another leap of faith by marrying his 
beautiful wife, Sabrina. 
After leading my legislative team for several 
years, Brandon became my Chief of Staff and 
has supported me, my staff and the families of 
the Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District for the 
last 6 years. As Chief, he helped develop in-
novative district programming and built a di-
verse staff to advance the interests of families 
from Kankakee to Chicago’s South Shore. 
After more than a dozen years serving the 
American people as a Congressional staffer, 
Brandon is departing for a new role in our na-
tion’s growing and dynamic tech sector. While 
he will be missed, his legacy of hard work 
speaks volumes about him, his passion and 
spirit. 
Brandon comes from a family dedicated to 
public service and is a proud brother of Kappa 
Alpha Psi. Through his service in Congress 
and to the American public, he has made 
them very proud. 
Again, I thank Brandon for his years of serv-
ice to the people of Georgia’s 12th District and 
Illinois’ 2nd District.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE 
OF BARBARA ALLEN BABCOCK 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and extraordinary work of Bar-
bara Allen Babcock. Born on July 26, 1938, in 
Washington, D.C., to Doris Moses and Henry 
Allen Babcock, she died at her Stanford, Cali-
fornia home on April 18, 2020. 
Barbara graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the 
University of Pennsylvania and Yale Law 
School, where she was one of only 13 women 
in a class of 175. At Yale, she was an editor 
of the Law Review and graduated Order of the 
Coif. Her first job was a clerkship for Judge 
Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals 
District of Columbia Circuit, after which she 
was a criminal defense associate at Williams 
and Connolly. She left private practice in 1968 
to become the first Director of the Public De-
fender Service for the District of Columbia. 
Barbara Babcock joined the faculty of Stan-
ford Law School in 1972, became its first 
tenured woman professor, and was the Judge 
John Crown Professor of Law, Emerita, at the 
time of her death. At Stanford she was be-
loved by her students, and four times was the 
recipient of the John Bingham Hurlbut Award 
for excellence in teaching. She left Stanford 
for two years during the Carter Administration 
to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the 
Civil Division in the Department of Justice, and 
while in that position she advocated for the 
appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the 
United States Court of Appeals. Justice Gins-
burg said later, ‘‘I would not hold the good job 
I have today were it not for Barbara.’’ 
Barbara Babcock was a strong and effective 
advocate for women and minorities, and an in-
spiration to thousands of her students and oth-
ers aspiring to legal careers. So many de-
scribed her as warm, graceful, a great racon-
teur and a true friend. She was a leader, a 
pathbreaker, trailblazer and role model. She 
was an advocate for the importance of lawyers 
in society and for clinical education in law 
school, and helped to found Stanford’s first 
law clinic, now the Stanford Community Law 
Clinic. 
Barbara Babcock was the author of many 
legal articles and several text books. She also 
wrote a memoir, Fish Raincoats: A Woman 
Lawyer’s Life, and Woman Lawyer: The Trials 
of Clara Foltz, about the first woman lawyer in 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in extending our 
condolences to Barbara Allen Babcock’s fam-
ily and honoring her extraordinary life. 
Because of her lifetime of shaping genera-
tions to practice and love the law, create a 
more just society, and an unswerving commit-
ment to see that women advanced in our na-
tion, Barbara Babcock bettered our country 
immeasurably and will forever be a national 
treasure.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Ms. LaShunn Campbell who is

She is a proud graduate of Forest Hill High

Jackson State University in Biology/Pre-Med 
and a Masters from Belhaven University. She

Temple Church and a member of Zeta Phi 
Beta, Sorority, Inc. 
Ms. Campbell started at the Hinds County 
Tax Collector’s office 13 years ago as a clerk. 
She currently serves as a supervisor. 
Her dream has always been to care for 
those who are too weak to care for them-
selves. This led her to pursue a nursing de-
gree from Hinds Community College. She cur-
rently duals as a nurse in the evening and on 
weekends.

HONORING SAMUEL CHAPEL 
UNITED METHODIST CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
church, Samuel Chapel United Methodist 
Church. 
Samuel Chapel United Methodist Church, 
originally named Samuel Chapel Methodist 
Episcopal Church, had its beginning in 1880 
under the leadership of Rev. McBeth. With the 
help of God and a few members, a one room 
frame building was erected in the South-
eastern section of Itta Bena. 
Following the leadership of Rev. McBeth, 
Rev. Grant Orange was assigned to pastor the 
few members of Samuel Chapel. As time 
elapsed, Rev. Orange was replaced by Rev. 
E.C.F. Troupe. As the church grew under the 
leadership of Rev. Troupe, it became nec-
essary to choose a new site which was in the 
Western section of Itta Bena, its current loca-
tion. In 1911, the frame structure was replaced 
by a brick structure as Rev. Troupe’s vision for 
growth emerged. 
Rev. H.B. Hart was the next pastor who 
lead the members in purchasing a parsonage, 
a house bought from Mrs. Nellie Mitchell. His 
leadership encompassed the organization of 
the church choir and securing pews and other 
serviceable facilities for the church. 
During Rev. M.J. Stallings tenure, the mem-
bership diminished because of mass migration 
from the Itta Bena area. Under Rev. Stallings 
leadership, plans were drawn up to rebuild 
Samuel Chapel and the old structure was de-
molished and a new church was rebuilt in 
1968. The dedication of the new Samuel 
Chapel United Methodist Church was Feb-
ruary 20, 1977. Rev. Stallings Pastorage ex-
tended for thirteen years. Following the 
homegoing of their dearly beloved pastor, 
Rev. M.J. Stallings, many pastors served, and 
the church continued to grow. Each pastor 
poured into the members their vision of excel-
lence in living a life pleasing to our Almighty 
God. Seeking the lost and discipling the found 
stimulated all facets of the church member-
ship. 
Samuel Chapel’s current Pastor is Rev. Jon-
athan Parker who is also the Director of the 
Wesley Foundation Campus Ministry at Mis-
sissippi Valley State University. 
The church’s motto of identity is that ‘‘we 
are the church with warm hearts and friendly 
hands.’’ Their health ministry has touched the 
lives of the entire community with its commu-
nity garden, quarterly health screenings, the 
church’s connection with the Mississippi Delta 
Health Collaborative, and their partnership 
with the Society of St. Andrews Gleaming Min-
istry. This gleaning network organizes volun-
teers to collect and distribute fresh produce 
gleaned from farmers’ fields and orchards 
after the harvest. Samuel Chapel’s United 
Methodist Men travel to Jackson or other 
areas and transport gleaned produce to the 
Itta Bena community and citizens are welcome 
to come to the church and receive all types of 
food items at no cost. The church’s outreach 
ministry has been instrumental in being a 
source for those in need of nutritious food. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Samuel Chapel United 
Methodist Church for its longevity and dedica-
tion to serving others.

HONORING DAVID SNAPP 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor my dear friend and former col-
league, Dave Snapp on the occasion of his re-
tirement. I met Dave Snapp in the late sum-
mer of 1983 when I had just turned 23 years 
old and we were trying to learn how to help 
nursing home workers organize for a better life 
with the Service Employees International 
Union. Thirty-seven years later, Dave is still at 
it, helping workers organize for dignity, voice 
and power in an America that suddenly deems 
them essential even while asking them to toil 
in poverty, in unsafe conditions, even under 
threat of deportation. 
After I left SEIU in 1988, Dave kept right on 
organizing. And he never stopped working for 
the labor movement. He played many roles for 
the union over the years. He has often been 
in the middle of the activities that have made 
SEIU so innovative. Dave has often served as 
a facilitator and organizer for the executive 
leadership of the union. He has been a 
scriptor and choreographer of conventions. He 
has organized strategic planning. He has con-
ceived and undertaken special projects. He 
has helped drive long-term thinking to an ex-
tent and scope remarkable in the labor move-
ment and, indeed, in other parts of the Amer-
ican political economy. 
Through it all, Dave has displayed a remark-
able mix of traits that are rarely found rolled 
up in one person. Flat-out smarts. Intellectual 
curiosity. Practicality—a groundedness in how 
things might actually work in the real world. 
Maybe that’s the health and safety guy in him. 
Humility. A willingness to speak truth to power 
and not to tell leaders what they want to hear, 
somehow without alienating them and indeed 
engendering their loyalty. A wry sense of 
humor, sometimes bleeding into bad jokes. 
Compassion and caring for his fellow travelers 
along the road to justice, person to person. 
How lucky I have been to have acquired 
Dave as an adopted-without-permission big 
brother so many years ago and, I might add, 
to have acquired a big sister in his life partner, 
Carol Regan. That’s the best two-for-one deal 
I ever got, all by signing up to help nursing 
home workers find a little power over their 
own work lives. 
Now Dave says he is laying down his tools. 
If we’re honest, we often have mixed feelings 
about friends retiring as a reflection of our own 
mortality. But I have to admit, I can’t think of 
anyone who has earned a bit of rest from re-
lentless labor more richly than Dave Snapp. 
He always looked at work organically, as how 
best to organize something that needed to be 
accomplished, and thus seemed to own what 
he was doing so completely. Thank goodness 
he chose to labor on behalf of America’s work-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, happily, there is no retiring 
from adopted big brotherhood. I will continue 
to seek Dave’s advice and counsel on life’s 
journey. And to take inspiration from his exam-
ple of doing things well for all the right rea-
sons. 
IN MEMORY OF HERMAN ‘‘HERK’’ 
STREITBURGER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Herman ‘‘Herk’’ Streitburger, a World 
War II hero and prisoner of war who passed 
away in late May, less than a month before 
his 101st birthday. Through both his military 
service and his subsequent community en-
gagement, Herk will be remembered as a 
shining example of American fortitude, inge-
nuity, and empathy. 
During World War II, Herk served in the 
U.S. Army Air Corps as a radio operator and 
gunner on a B–24 Liberator bomber. During 
his final mission with the 98th Bombardment 
Group, his plane was shot down over German 
territory. He was taken to the Stalag Luft IV 
prison camp, where he and fellow prisoners 
listened to war reports on a contraband radio 
they carefully concealed in a hollow table leg. 
Buoyed by radio reports of Allied success, 
they made a risky escape during a deadly win-
ter march. After being caught by a German 
soldier, Herk’s quick thinking and compassion 
secured their safety: he spoke German with 
the officer, offered him coffee and a smuggled 
American cigarette, and they shook hands, 
parting in peace. 
After the war, Herk attended college through 
the GI bill and later started a family, first on 
Long Island before moving to Bedford in 1967. 
Following a career in marketing, he spent dec-
ades mentoring small business owners with 
SCORE and visiting with school groups to talk 
about his POW experience and life lessons. 
All those who knew Herk or ever heard him 
speak remarked at his positive attitude and 
optimism about life. 
Herk was an engaged member of local and 
regional 
veterans 
associations, 
including 
Honor Flight New England, the American Le-
gion NH, the NH Ex-POW Chapter #1, and the 
Northeast POW/MIA Network. In his commu-
nity, he was admired for his ardent faith, gen-
erosity, and optimism. 
On behalf of all of my constituents in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I 
share my condolences to Herk’s four children, 
seven grandchildren, and four great grand-
children. May Herk Streitburger’s memory be 
for a blessing.

advanced degree at Arkansas State Univer-
sity. 
During Ms. Carter’s educational career, she 
has been an elementary school teacher in the 
areas of English and History. She also served 
as an Instructional Coach before joining the 
administrative team as an Assistant Principal 
in 2017. 
Mrs. Cashoney Carter has been involved in 
many professional memberships along her 
journey including, the National Council for So-
cial Studies and Mississippi Association of 
Educators in conjunction with the Jefferson 
County Association of Educators where she 
serves as the local representative. She is also 
a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, In-
corporated and the President of the Nubian 
Social Aid and Pleasure Club. Her most treas-
ured role is being the mother of Harley Eliza-
beth. 
Ms. Cashoney Carter believes in her stu-
dents and believes that the student’s growth is 
the most important aspect of learning. She be-
lieves that visibility, teamwork, and collabora-
tion between home and school promotes a 
school culture that empowers students to 
reach their academic and personal goals while 
becoming educated young adults. 
The Jefferson County School District is 
pleased to announce that Ms. Cashoney Car-
ter has been appointed as principal of the Jef-
ferson County Upper Elementary School for 
the 2020–2021 school year. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Cashoney Carter for 
her dedication and remarkable works.

INTRODUCTION OF THE GEORGE 
FLOYD 
LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
TRUST AND INTEGRITY ACT OF 
2020 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to announce to the House that I have intro-
duced the George Floyd Law Enforcement 
Trust and Integrity Act of 2020 (LETIA) to 
modernize law enforcement training, practices 
and procedures, and to address the issue of 
police accountability and build trust between 
police departments and the communities they 
serve. 
Over the past two decades, tensions be-
tween police and communities of color have 
grown as allegations of bias-based policing by 
law enforcement agents, sometimes supported 
by data collection efforts and video evidence, 
have increased in number and frequency. 
This legislation is designed to provide incen-
tives for local police departments to voluntarily 
adopt performance-based standards to mini-
mize incidents of misconduct, improve oper-
ations and enhance community accountability. 
Since the tragic police-involved shooting of 
Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, there 
has been public outcry for Congressional ac-
tion to address police accountability and public 
safety issues through the adoption of sub-
stantive law enforcement policy reforms. 
Despite the fact that the majority of law en-
forcement officers perform their duties profes-
sionally and without bias, the relationship be-
tween the police and some of minority com-
munities has deteriorated to such a degree 
that federal action is required to begin ad-
dressing the issue. 
With recent Washington Post reports of 
more than 1000 reported police-involved 
shooting fatalities in the last year, the time is 
long past for bipartisan action. 
The George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust 
and Integrity Act of 2020 provides incentives 
for local police organizations to voluntarily 
adopt performance-based standards to ensure 
that incidents of deadly force or misconduct 
will be minimized through appropriate man-
agement and training protocols and properly 
investigated, should they occur. 
The legislation authorizes the Department of 
Justice to work cooperatively with independent 
accreditation, law enforcement and commu-
nity-based organizations to further develop 
and refine the accreditation standards, and au-
thorizes the Attorney General to make grants 
to law enforcement agencies for the purpose 
of obtaining accreditation from certified law en-
forcement accreditation organizations. 
Beyond the human toll created by law en-
forcement accountability issues, there remains 
the fiscal impact created by the high cost of 
litigation settlements for police abuse claims. 
Currently, there are no federally recognized 
minimum standards to follow for operating a 
police department. 
The ad hoc nature of police management 
has left many officers and agencies in the 
dark about how to cope with changes in their 
communities. 
While most cities fail to systematically track 
the cost of litigation, the cost reports for major 
cities can prove staggering. 
In New York City alone, during Mayor Mi-
chael Bloomberg’s three term tenure, NYPD 
payouts were in excess of $1 billion dollars for 
policing claims. 
For small departments, the cost of a single 
high-profile incident could prove crippling in its 
impact on public safety. 
While the Department of Justice has a 
range of criminal and civil authority to address 
policing issues, the Civil Rights Division will 
never have the resources necessary to inves-
tigate more than a small fraction of those de-
partments engaged in unconstitutional con-
duct, even with the enhanced funding and task 
force authority granted by this legislation. 
Through the support of a robust accredita-
tion 
regime, 
like 
that 
existing 
for 
the 
healthcare industry, Congress can ensure that 
all communities have the best trained and 
managed police departments. 
Only by establishing acceptable police oper-
ations standards can we begin to address 
issues like use of force before they occur and 
heal the rifts within our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House to ob-
serve a moment of silence in memory of 
George Floyd and for all Members to join me 
in sponsoring the George Floyd Law Enforce-
ment Trust and Integrity Act of 2020 (LETIA).

RECOGNIZING ALMA LEE LOY 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on April 10, 
2020, Vero Beach said good-bye to its First 
Lady and prolific community leader, Alma Lee 
Loy, who passed away at 90 years old of 
pneumonia-related complications. As a per-
sonal friend and beloved member of our com-
munity, I would like to take this time to recog-
nize the countless contributions Alma has 
made to Indian River County and celebrate a 
lifetime of extraordinary personal achieve-
ments. 
Alma Lee Loy was born in Vero Beach on 
June 10, 1929 and from a very young age 
dedicated her life to the betterment of Indian 
River County, the community she so loved 
and was revered by. Ask any Vero Beach 
Resident if they knew of her, and they would 
surely say yes, with mentions of fond memo-
ries and stories. 
Throughout her life she wore many impor-
tant hats that made her into the iconic woman 
that our community grew to respect and love. 
Alma was a compassionate neighbor, a phi-
lanthropist, accomplished athlete, successful 
businesswoman, historian, and a mentor to 
our community’s youth, just to name a few. 
For the first 42 years of her career, she op-
erated and ran a children’s clothing store in 
downtown Vero Beach, Alma Lee’s Clothing 
Center, alongside her close friend Lucy 
Auxier. It was here that the community first 
befriended her, as they shopped for years for 
back-to-school clothes and dresses and came 
to know her giving heart. But in more than one 
way, Alma was compelled to further serve her 
community. 
Her civic engagement spans many sectors. 
She became a founding member of the Vero 
Beach City Recreation Board, the Vero Beach 
Downtown Merchants Association, Education 
Foundation of Indian River County and the In-
dian River Community Foundation. Her altru-
istic spirit drove her to volunteer and lead sev-
eral philanthropic organizations including what 
is now the Vero Beach Museum of Art and the 
Gifford Youth Orchestra. From 1968 to 1980, 
Alma served on the Indian River County Board 
of County Commissioners, serving as Chair-
man and Vice Chairman. 
Alma’s unwavering commitment to pre-
serving her community’s natural beauty and 
treasures, in addition to educating the public 
about its’ historical significance, has long 
helped spread awareness of important issues 
in Indian River County. She played an impor-
tant role in raising the awareness that saved 
the 18-acre McKee Botanical Garden from 
housing development, serving twice as Presi-
dent of the garden. She served on the board 
of the Veterans Memorial Island Sanctuary 
Committee, served two terms as President of 
the Indian River Land Trust, and received the 
‘‘Love Your Lagoon’’ award for her dedication 
to cleaning up our waterways. 
Many of Alma’s achievements succeed her 
in the form of local buildings and awards, in-
cluding the Alma Lee Loy Bridge on 17th 
Street and the Alma Lee Loy Indian River 
County Chamber of Commerce, where she 
served as the first female board member. 
There have been many contributions and 
awards made in her honor and through them, 
she will be revered and dearly missed as a 
leader in our community. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing 
Alma Lee Loy. May her dedication to our com-
munity serve as a reminder of what it means 
to be a public servant, a good neighbor, a 
mentor, and leader. Her impact and legacy will

HONORING FOLUSO FAKOREDE, MD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Foluso 
Fakorede. 
Dr. Fakorede grew up in Nigeria and immi-
grated to America as a young man. He re-
ceived his medical degree from UMDNJ-Rob-
ert Wood Johnson Medical School in Camden, 
New Jersey where he also completed his in-
ternship and residency in internal medicine at 
New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Hospital. 
He returned to New Jersey to complete his fel-
lowship in cardiology, interventional cardi-
ology, and endovascular intervention at Coo-
per University Hospital—Camden, New Jer-
sey. 
Dr. Fakorede was honored with the distinc-
tion of Chief Cardiology Fellow. He specializes 
in preventative cardiovascular management, 
woman’s heart health and catheter-based pro-
cedural focus in coronary atherosclerosis dis-
ease (CAD) and peripheral atherosclerosis 
disease (PAD). He has advanced technical 
skills in limb salvage (preventing amputations) 
and utilizes advanced minimally invasive tech-
niques in treating patients with peripheral arte-
rial disease. He is also a key opinion leader in 
the treatment algorithm of peripheral arterial 
disease using various access techniques, 
atherectomy, balloons and stents. 
In 2015, Dr. Fakorede started Cardio-
vascular Solutions of Central Mississippi with 
a mission to educate and provide access qual-
ity health care for Mississippians living in rural 
areas. He has become a national voice in the 
fight on the impact of health disparity in under-
served communities. 
Dr. Fakorede has offered tremendous serv-
ice to those suffering from diabetes and has 
worked diligently towards preventing the need 
for amputation. 
In Bolivar County, MS, Dr. Fakorede has 
seen more than 10,000 cardiovascular pa-
tients from around the Delta. Since 2015, he 
has performed nearly 500 angiograms annu-
ally. Between 2014 and 2017, Bolivar Medical 
Center recorded that major amputations had 
fallen by 75 percent. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Foluso Fakorede for his 
dedication in being a remarkable doctor and 
servicing the Mississippi Delta.

HONORING RAY LEE WOOD 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Ray Lee Wood of Stuart, Virginia. Mr. 
Wood passed away on May 6, 2020, at the 
age of 92. As one of the founding members of 
Wood Brothers Racing, Mr. Wood helped 
launch a storied team and competed in some 
of its signature victories. 
Ray Lee Wood was born in Patrick County 
on December 14, 1927. He served in the 
Army after World War II. In the early 1950s, 
he joined his brothers Glenn, Clay, Delano 
and Leonard in forming the team that still 
bears their name. They famously worked on 
their cars in the shade of a beech tree on the 
family’s property, using its limbs to help pull 
engines with a chain hoist. Ray Lee was re-
sponsible for maintaining the Fords the team 
raced and changing the front tires, not driving, 
although Leonard recalled a day in 1958 when 
Ray Lee hit 142 miles per hour on the meas-
ured mile at Daytona Beach. 
During Mr. Wood’s time with the team, it 
won at the 1963 Daytona 500, the 1965 Indi-
anapolis 500, and the 1965 American 500 at 
North Carolina Speedway. At Daytona and In-
dianapolis, he made the call after checking the 
tires to continue driving rather than changing 
them, contributing to the victories. 
At the 1965 Indianapolis 500, Mr. Wood 
also decided that the season would be his 
last. After the season ended at Rockingham 
with the victory at the American 500, he went 
home to Stuart. While still following the sport 
and supporting his brothers who continued 
racing, he never attended another NASCAR 
race. Instead, he filled his life with his church, 
Pentecostal Holiness, and his garden, where 
he grew flowers, tended to his honeybees, 
and kept goldfish. 
I offer my condolences to Ray Lee Wood’s 
loved ones on their loss.

REMEMBERING MADELYNE 
‘‘MADDI’’ MISCHELOFF 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of 
Madelyne ‘‘Maddi’’ Mischeloff, on the occasion 
of her passing after a two year long battle with 
cancer on Saturday, April 11, 2020. 
Maddi was a native of Neptune, New Jersey 
and a student of biology and medical tech-
nology at American University in Washington, 
DC. She met her husband, Mike, while both 
were spending spring break in California. They 
remained in touch and were married in 1971. 
Thereafter they moved to Nebraska where 
their three children were born before settling in 
the Bay Area. 
Maddi was a serial volunteer and could fre-
quently be found working at community events 
after she and her family settled in my home-
town of Dublin in 1978; however, it was when 
unimaginable tragedy struck the family that 
Maddi’s spirit of service galvanized around a 
cause. Ilene, Maddi and Mike’s 13 year-old 
daughter, went missing on a walk home from 
middle school on January 30, 1989. 
From that moment forward, Maddi garnered 
the strength to turn her grief into action, moti-
vation, and inspiration for others. She partici-
pated in fund raisers, did television appear-
ances, and organized on behalf of her daugh-
ter and other families navigating the same 
trauma and trying to bring missing children 
home. 
While Ilene’s disappearance remains un-
solved, Maddi’s efforts to keep her daughter’s 
spirit alive in our community continued with an 
annual candlelit walk along the route that Ilene 
walked home from school each day. 
Her efforts to better her community did not 
go unnoticed. After years of faithful service to 
her community, she was appointed to fill a va-
cant seat on the board of the Dublin San 
Ramon Services District to which she later 
won election, served on a multitude of commit-

TRIBUTE TO THE WORK OF DAVID 
WAKSBERG 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. 
ESHOO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
David 
Waksberg became CEO of the Bureau of Jew-
ish Education in 2007, and retires on 
June 30, 2020, from his leadership of what 
is now Jewish LearningWorks. During his well- 
earned retirement he will spend more time 
with his wife and three adult children, and he 
plans to write and participate in political and 
environmental activism. 
David Waksberg’s leadership of Jewish 
LearningWorks can only be called extraor-
dinary. He is hailed by many as a great nego-
tiator, intentional listener and a collaborator 
who respects and honors the opinions of oth-
ers. During his tenure he helped renew syna-
gogue schools and brought in new ideas for 
teaching. He expanded family learning pro-
grams, created greater opportunities for chil-
dren with special needs, and initiated policy 
changes at synagogues and day schools 
which were all designed to make everyone 
welcome. 
David formerly served as the Executive Di-
rector of the Bay Area Council for Soviet Jews 
where he created programs that connected 
Bay Area Jews with those in the Soviet Union. 
He developed excellent relationships with the 
Bay Area Congressional Delegation and was a 
strong advocate for refuseniks and for the So-
viet Jews who came to the Bay Area after the 
collapse of the USSR. Between his two posi-
tions with Jewish agencies, David worked at a 
high-tech company, but his heart was always 
with service to the Jewish community.

David credits his commitment to Judaism 
and Jewish education to a photograph in his 
Polish grandparents’ home in the Bronx, of 
their families in Poland. All except those who 
had gone to America or Israel, including Da-
vid’s father, were killed by the Nazis. Also in 
that home was an inscription that asked ‘‘What 
have you done today on behalf of your people 
and your land?’’ 
David Waksberg said ‘‘For me, Jewish 
thought, tradition and wisdom from the last 
few thousand years really helped me be a bet-
ter husband, father, son, brother, friend, neigh-
bor and citizen. All this wisdom contributed to 
what some would call happiness. It helped me 
lead a good life. And that’s the point of it all.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we ask the entire House 
of Representatives to join us in honoring the 
extraordinary leadership and legacies of David 
Waksberg. His mission of promoting and fur-
thering Jewish education has bettered our 
communities and made our nation stronger 
because of all he has chosen to do.

THANKING TURKEY FOR 
ASSISTANCE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the efforts of one 
of our allies to assist with our coronavirus re-
sponse. Recently, the Republic of Turkey sent 
two separate planeloads of medical supplies 
to the United States. One arrived on Tuesday 
and a second on Thursday. The Turkish gov-
ernment sent 500,000 surgical masks, 4,000 
overalls, 1,500 sets of goggles, civilian masks, 
face shields, hazmat suits, and a generous 
supply of disinfectants. 
This is the type of cooperation that we need 
to see on every level in order to effectively ad-
dress this pandemic. I understand that U.S. 
Ambassador to Turkey, David Satterfield, was 
on hand to watch the second shipment depart 
Turkey. I am pleased to see our governments 
working closely together. I understand that 
Turkey made deliveries of medical supplies 
and equipment to more than 50 countries 
around the world, and I commend them for 
such generosity. It is in our common interests 
to continue to find constructive ways to work 
together.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
JONES ACT 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, this week we 
celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Jones 
Act and its century of fostering our domestic 
maritime industry and supporting our national 
security. Named in honor of its author, former 
Senator Wesley Jones, the Jones Act has 
helped provide economic benefits in times of 
peace and has safeguarded resources to ex-
pand our military maritime capacity for times 
of war. 
For the Department of Defense, maintaining 
a U.S. flagged fleet is critical to ensuring we 
have sufficient U.S. sealift capacity, available 
at a moment’s notice, to defend our nation. 
For example, during Operations Enduring 
Freedom and Iraqi Freedom from 2002 to 
2010, U.S.-flag commercial vessels trans-
ported nearly 60% of all military cargoes into 
Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Not only does the Jones Act support this 
vital national security requirement, it also pro-
vides an economic benefit to our nation. 
Currently, there are about 40,000 vessels in 
the American domestic fleet. The domestic 
maritime industry supports nearly 650,000 jobs 
and has a gross economic output of $154 bil-
lion annually, generating $41.6 billion annually 
in income with a $16.8 billion tax impact. 
In my state of Texas, the domestic maritime 
industry is a major economic driver. According 
to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the 
Transportation Institute, Texas ranks No. 3 
among all U.S. states for jobs related to the 
American domestic maritime industry. The 
state is home to an estimated 56,000 Jones 
Act-related domestic maritime industry jobs, 
and the domestic shipping industry contributes 
approximately $14 billion in annual economic 
impact and $4 billion in worker income to the 
Texas economy. 
In the 34th Congressional District, which I 
have the honor to represent, there are 1,100 
Jones Act-related jobs. This translates into 
over $174 million in economic impact to my 
Congressional district. 
On March 16th, I was scheduled to partici-
pate in an event at the Port of Brownsville in 
my district, highlighting the importance of our 
domestic maritime industry and the Jones Act. 
As with so many activities throughout our na-
tion and the world over the past several 
months, this event was postponed due to 
COVID–19, but I am pleased to have this op-
portunity today to express my support for this 
important industry and its workforce. 
At the Port of Brownsville, Keppel AmFels is 
currently constructing two ’Ohana Class con-
tainerships for Pasha Hawaii, an American 
shipping company. These ships will be used to 
transport containers of goods between Hawaii 
and the U.S. mainland. 
It was just a few years ago that Keppel 
AmFELS decided to invest over $30 million to 
start this new industry at the Port of Browns-
ville. We worked with the U.S. Department of 
Commerce’s Economic Development Adminis-
tration to secure nearly $2 million in federal 
funds for the vessel assembly pad to help 
make this happen. 
I look forward to the time when we can cele-
brate the building of these two ships—the M/ 
V Jean Marie and the M/V George III—in per-
son.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HARD 
WORK 
AND DEDICATION OF ZACHARY 
K. OSTRO 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to thank my departing Legislative 
Director, Zachary K. Ostro, for his hard work 
and dedication. 
Zach joined my team as a Legislative Fellow 
shortly after completing his JD at the Univer-
sity of Maryland School of Law. As a fellow, 
one of his largest contributions came as Chief 
Content Editor of the 2014 Kelly Report on 
Gun Violence in America, the first-ever Con-
gressional analysis of the nation’s gun vio-
lence epidemic. He quickly became an indis-
pensable part of the team and transitioned into 
a full-time role as a Legislative Assistant. In 
2016, he became Legislative Director and 
helped me enact a number of bills including 
the Connected Government Act and Action for 
Dental Health Act into law. 
While leading my legislative team, Zach also 
continued his education and obtained an MBA 
from Georgetown University in 2018. His fam-
ily also grew while part of Team Kelly with the 
birth of his beautiful daughter, Sophie. 
Originally from Cleveland, Zach is a diehard 
Indians fan and avid bowler. As he departs for 
a new opportunity, I wish him and his family 
all the best. 
Again, I thank Zach for his years of service 
to the 2nd Congressional District of Illinois.

HONORING DR. TAMMY TEREL 
TAYLOR 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Tammy 
Terel Taylor. 
Dr. Tammy Terel Taylor was born to the late 
NR Taylor and Alberta Smith-Taylor. She is 
the third youngest of fourteen siblings. She 
entered the world during very troubling and 
uncertain times. Dr. Martin Luther King had 
just been assassinated a few months before 
her arrival and Senator Robert Kennedy as-
sassinated on the exact same day she was 
born. She believes her passion for social free-
dom and equality to all humankind started in 
utero. Her parents instilled into her and her 
other siblings the importance of the Golden 
Rule, ‘‘Do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you.’’ She grew up in a tradi-
tional family structure where her father was 
the sole provider while her mother took care of 
home. Dr. Taylor was raised up on the family’s 
farm and refers to her family as the ‘‘Black 
Walton’s’’ and often says ‘‘Although money 
was not plentiful her family had an abundance 
of love and fortitude when faced with adver-
sity’’. Dr. Taylor’s family truly understood what 
it meant to live off the land. Her father farmed 
their land for several years and later pursued 
a construction career when farming alone was 
not enough to provide for his family. Dr. Taylor 
credits her perseverance and strong work eth-
ics to her late father and her undeniable faith 
and endurance to her mother. 
Dr. Taylor was born and grew up in Sardis, 
MS. She attended and graduated from North 
Panola High School in 1987. She attended 
Northwest Community College following high 
school and later transferred to the University 
of Mississippi majoring in Sociology with a 
minor in Psychology; she graduated in August 
of 1993. After graduating from the University 
of MS, Dr. Taylor begin her nursing career at 
Northwest Community College (NWCC) in 
Senatobia, MS. NWCC had the reputation of 
producing some of the best registered nurses 
(RNs) and if you successfully completed their

very rigorous nursing program you were well 
prepared for the challenges ahead. 
Dr. Taylor started her nursing career at Bap-
tist Memorial Hospital (BMH) in Oxford, MS 
and worked at this facility for 7 years as the 
Charge Nurse. While working at BMH full-time, 
she traveled once a week to Alcorn State Uni-
versity (ASU) nursing campus for the next 2 
years. She earned her Master of Science as 
a Nurse Educator graduating with highest dis-
tinction and inducted into the Sigma Theta 
Tau National Honor Society of Nursing. She 
accepted an Assistant Professor position in 
their Associate Degree Nursing at ASU. Dr. 
Taylor possessed not only a passion for learn-
ing but immensely enjoyed teaching and shar-
ing her knowledge and clinical experience. 
While teaching full-time at ASU, Dr. Taylor 
earned her Post Master’s as a Family Nurse 
Practitioner (FNP). This was a very difficult 
time in her life because her sister and best 
friend, Renetha, was diagnosed with a ter-
minal cancer and lost her battle on October 6, 
2002. 
In January of 2004 a unique opportunity 
arose and Dr. Taylor was invited to join a 
team of dynamic African American women 
with a diverse background in the nursing pro-
fession to start the first Associate Degree 
Nursing Program at Coahoma Community Col-
lege in Clarksdale, MS. Dr. Taylor and other 
faculty referred to themselves as the ‘‘Dream 
Team’’ and was determined to create one of 
the best nursing programs for those aspiring 
to become registered nurses in the state of 
MS. Although this dream was short-lived, her 
dynamic team laid the groundwork and this 
RN program is thriving today. Dr. Taylor has 
dedicated years of service into almost all 
areas of nursing from the hospital setting to 
academia to correctional setting just to name 
a few. 
On March of 2009, Dr. Taylor accepted a 
position in the MS Delta at a private Cardi-
ology practice. This in many ways for her was 
surreal because now she would be providing 
care to patients with heart disease, a disease 
that abruptly ended her own father’s life at the 
age of forty-six. She was eager to accept this 
challenge because this would give her the op-
portunity to help others combat heart disease 
and save lives, something she was not able to 
do for her very own father. Dr. Taylor knew 
this had to be fate, a higher power orches-
trating this only-for-her opportunity. 
On January 2010, Dr. Taylor pursued her 
highest level of education in her profession. 
While working full-time as a Cardiology Nurse 
Practitioner, she began her doctoral degree at 
the University of Alabama Capstone College 
of Graduate Nursing. Her scholarly project ex-
plored the precursors of coronary heart dis-
ease among women of color in the MS Delta. 
She graduated with a 4.0 GPA and again in-
ducted into the Sigma Theta Tau National 
Honor Society for Nursing, the Honor Society 
of Phi Kappa Phi and the Golden Key Inter-
national Honor Society. Dr. Taylor earned her 
Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and her 
Hooding Ceremony was on the former Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s birthday August 4, the 
year 2012. 
Dr. Taylor still practices in the MS Delta 
specializing in heart disease and managing 
other chronic diseases such as hypertension, 
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc. She is an advo-
cate for change and currently serves as the 
Lead Volunteer in the state of MS for the Na-
tional Patient Advocate Foundation (NPAF) 
out of Washington, DC. Dr. Taylor has at-
tended the last three Patient Congress in DC 
to be the change agent and voice for her pa-
tients. Dr. Taylor was selected by the Patient- 
Centered 
Outcomes 
Research 
Institute 
(PCORI) and National Institute of Health (NIH) 
to serve as a stakeholder reviewer for new 
funding opportunity: Testing Multi-Level Inter-
ventions to Improve Blood Pressure Control in 
Minority Racial/Ethnic, Low Socioeconomic 
Status, and/or Rural Populations. 
Dr. Taylor is an entrepreneur and recently 
started on own business Day by Day Health 
and Wellness to be the change she wishes to 
see in the world. Her passion for healthcare 
runs deep but she sees the bigger picture and 
that is focusing more on preventive care 
versus sick care. Dr. Taylor currently serves 
as a Community Advisory Board member for 
Panola County for the Risk Underlying Rural 
Areas Longitudinal Study (RURAL). She is an 
active member of the Mississippi Nurses As-
sociation. She is an active member of the dis-
tinguished ladies of the Alpha Kappa Alpha 
Sorority Incorporated, Upsilon Iota Omega 
Chapter. She is also an active member of the 
NAACP Panola County Branch. And lastly and 
more importantly, she is the doting aunt to her 
nieces and nephews and the loving wife to her 
soulmate, Mr. Whittington Bufford, Jr. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Tammy Terel Taylor for 
her dedication to serving her community and 
this great state.

MILITARY SPOUSE CAREER 
EDUCATION ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Military Spouse Career Education 
Act to help military spouses access the edu-
cation they need to enter and excel in careers 
that require government-recognized creden-
tials. 
My bill would help military spouses achieve 
their career goals by covering the costs of 
exams awarding college credit and continuing 
education units needed to maintain profes-
sional licenses and certifications. 
Military spouses participating in the My Ca-
reer Advancement Account (MyCAA) Scholar-
ship Program would be able to finish their de-
grees faster by earning credit through exams 
such as the College-Level Examination Pro-
gram (CLEP) and DANTES Subject Standard-
ized Tests (DSST). CLEP and DSST award 
credit recognized by thousands of schools for 
a wide range of courses needed for degrees 
in health care, education, business, tech-
nology and other in-demand fields. Access to 
these alternatives to traditional classes pro-
vides spouses the ability to achieve their edu-
cational goals at their own pace while saving 
limited MyCAA funds for other expenses. 
Maintaining licenses and certifications would 
also be easier for MyCAA participants and 
spouses moving with their service member 
under permanent change of station orders. 
The Defense Department currently covers the 
cost of spouses’ relicensing fees when relo-
cating with their families. States and territories 
that do not recognize credentials from other 
jurisdictions may also require additional train-
ing. The Military Spouse Career Education Act 
reimburses spouses for the costs of continuing 
education units needed to keep their creden-
tials and continue careers in their new place of 
residence. 
The gentleman from Indiana, Mr. BANKS, is 
an original cosponsor of the bill. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

A FRESH START 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, to recognize the 20th anniversary of a 
local small business in Lakewood, Colorado— 
A Fresh Start. 
A Fresh Start is a prime example of the 
American Dream—owned and operated by 
Tom Bogeljic, a Bosnian refugee who came to 
the U.S. in 1997, and shortly after settling into 
the Denver suburbs, opened his own small 
business. A Fresh Start has grown substan-
tially in the last 20 years, and Tom has been 
at the forefront of its growth. 
A Fresh Start opened its doors in Lake-
wood, Colorado on December 1, 1999 and 
has provided commercial and residential 
cleaning to places across the 7th Congres-
sional District and Denver Metro area. It has 
survived quite a few challenges over the last 
20 years, surviving the Great Recession as 
well as being designated an essential service 
during the current COVID–19 public health cri-
sis. 
During Small Business Month, I want to rec-
ognize Tom and his business as examples of 
a true entrepreneurial spirit and his contribu-
tion to our community by using eco-friendly 
materials and putting his employees first. 
I extend my congratulations to Tom and A 
Fresh Start on its achievement of 20 success-
ful years in our community. Keep up the good 
work.

Scipione in recognition of his retirement from 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern Dis-
trict of New York after more than 40 years in 
public service, as the USAO NDNY Law En-
forcement Coordination Manager. Mr. Scipione 
has demonstrated a profound commitment to 
his community and country during his long ca-
reer in law enforcement and service in the 
U.S. Air Force and New York Air National 
Guard. 
A graduate of East Syracuse-Minoa High 
School and Onondaga Community College, 
Mr. Scipione began his career in law enforce-
ment in 1980 as a police officer for the Town 
of DeWitt Police Department. He subsequently 
went on to serve as an Investigator for the 
Onondaga County District Attorney’s Office, 
where he prepared cases for over 100 homi-
cide trials. In 2004, he was hired by the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of 
New York as the Law Enforcement Coordina-
tion Manager. Mr. Scipione served in this role 
for 16 years, working to facilitate and support 
law enforcement efforts to increase safety and 
enhance the quality of life for our community. 
In addition to his service in law enforce-
ment, Mr. Scipione served his country in the 
U.S. Air Force and in the New York Air Na-
tional Guard. During this time, he was de-
ployed overseas on several occasions, and 
notably, supported efforts in Kuwait during Op-
eration Desert Shield. 
Outside of public service, Mr. Scipione is a 
devoted husband to his wife, Cindy, and a 
dedicated father to their three children. He is 
a proud grandfather to four grandchildren and 
dog owner to his German Shepherd, Amish. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in recognizing Mr. Armond

ant, I wish Mr. Scipione the best in his retire-
ment.

OPPOSING THE GROW ACT’S 
INCLUSION IN THE HEROES ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased the House took important action to 
support the pensions of millions of Americans 
in the HEROES Act. Action to secure the re-
tirement benefits of workers and retirees in 
troubled multiemployer plans and the long- 
term solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC) remains a top priority of 
mine. Despite this positive effort, I am troubled 
by inclusion of provisions that impact healthy 
multiemployer pension plans. The inclusion of 
the GROW Act, which possesses significant 
conflicting support and opposition on impor-
tant, must pass legislation is deeply troubling. 
The GROW Act will hurt workers, retirees, em-
ployers and the PBGC, and should not be-
come law. 
Composite plan legislation would create two 
plans—an existing plan and a new ‘‘com-
posite’’ plan—out of a single, finite pool of as-
sets. This places added burden on the ability 
to fund each adequately, increasing the odds 
of failure. Existing plans could refinance their 
obligations over 25 years—more than 10 
years longer than current law allows. This re-
duces available funds for benefits under exist-
ing plans, making them vulnerable to funding 
shortfalls—and thus at risk for draconian ben-
efit cuts in times of market volatility. For exam-
ple, if Congress had already passed the 
GROW Act and it was law during the market 
volatility COVID inflicted on the stock market, 
the benefits composite plan participants ex-
pected to earn would be cut 70 percent, and 
the vested benefits they already earned would 
be cut 25 percent. At the same time, the vest-
ed benefits of participants in the existing plan 
would be cut 21 percent. 
In addition to using accounting gimmicks to 
weaken existing multiemployer pension plans 
and place Americans’ retirement security at 
risk, composite plans would also make it easi-
er for employers to withdraw from existing 
multiemployer pension plans altogether, with-
out paying their fair share of obligations to 
participants. Under current law, employers 
withdrawing from a pension plan must pay a 
‘‘withdrawal liability’’ based on their contribu-
tion to the plan. Provisions of the GROW act 
would eliminate withdrawal liability for com-
posite plans, and it would dramatically reduce 
the cost of withdrawing from an existing plan. 
Moreover, composite plans would not be in-
sured by the PBGC and would be exempt 
from paying PBGC premiums. This erodes the 
PBGC premium base significantly. When com-
bined with plan failures that composite plans 
would accelerate, the PBGC will face new li-
abilities that will drive it to a new solvency cri-
sis. Because of the grievous harm the GROW 
Act imposes on workers, retirees, the PBGC, 
and the entire multiemployer plan system, I 
strongly oppose its inclusion in the HEROES 
Act.

JONES ACT 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 4, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, tomor-
row June 5 marks the 100th anniversary of the 
Jones Act, our nation’s federal law guaran-
teeing a fleet of US-built, flagged, crewed, and 
owned vessels ready to serve the American 
people. 
The current coronavirus global pandemic 
has reminded us all the critical importance of 
this foundational federal law and having a vi-
brant US-flagged maritime industry. The global 
maritime trade ground to a halt due to quar-
antine, and countries like China ordered their 
government-sponsored enterprises to stop all 
exports of critical medicine and medical sup-
plies, including personal protective equipment 
for healthcare workers and first responders. 
The Jones Act ensures that our nation can 
remain self-reliant during peace time and 
times of conflict. In California alone, the US- 
flagged maritime industry supports more than 
$12.2 billion annually in economic impact re-
lated to the American domestic shipping in-
dustry and over 51,000 good-paying jobs. Na-
tionally, the domestic maritime industry sup-
ports 648,220 American jobs with approxi-
mately 40,000 vessels in the American do-
mestic fleet. 
Madam Speaker, most major developed 
countries including the European Union have 
cabotage laws like the Jones Act. Congress 
must continue to support our nation’s maritime 
workforce by upholding the Jones Act and op-
posing deeply misguided efforts to undermine 
it. As a member of both the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Committee on Armed Services, I plan to con-
tinue to do just that. 
I hope all members of Congress will join me 
in that important work. In closing, I wish to 
mark this important milestone for the Jones 
Act by thanking the thousands of Americans 
working in our nation’s maritime industry. I 
thank them for their invaluable work, day in, 
day out.
