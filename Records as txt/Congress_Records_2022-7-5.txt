HONORING 
THE 
10TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF JUNIOR SEAU’S PASS-
ING 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the extraordinary life of 
Junior Seau, who tragically passed away on 
May 2, 2012, in Oceanside, California. In 
honor of the 10th Anniversary of his passing, 
I would like to pay tribute to this incredible 
man and reflect on the life he led and the im-
pact he had on our Nation and community in 
the 49th District. 
Junior Seau was a born leader who inspired 
everyone he encountered. He was a football 
icon who paved the way for future generations 
of Samoan youth and was a generous philan-
thropist and humanitarian. Junior is survived 
by his parents, wife, children, siblings, and ex-
tended family. 
Junior Seau was born Tiaina Baul Seau, Jr. 
in San Diego, California on January 19, 1969. 
His parents, Tiaina Seau, Sr. and Luisa 
Mauga Seau, came to San Diego from Amer-
ican Samoa. Junior spent several years in 
America Samoa during his youth before re-
turning to Oceanside. 
He attended Oceanside High School where 
he developed his exceptional athletic abilities. 
While known for his contributions to the 
Oceanside High football program, Junior also 
lettered in basketball and track and field. As a 
starting linebacker and tight end for the varsity 
football team, he demonstrated his athletic 
prowess. During his senior year in 1987, Pa-
rade Magazine selected him for the high 
school All-American team. Junior is one of the 
greatest athletes our community has ever pro-
duced and in 2014, Oceanside High School 
honored Junior with an on-field tribute where 
they retired his number 11 jersey. 
His academic and athletic achievements 
earned him admission to the University of 
Southern California where he played for the 
Trojans from 1987 to 1990 before being draft-
ed to the National Football League. His USC 
career took off in 1989, and this season was 
one of the best in USC’s distinguished defen-
sive history, earning him the title of Pac-10 
Defensive Player of the Year. Junior’s legacy 
lives on at USC, as wearing his No. 55 jersey 
is now an honor bestowed upon those who 
follow in his footsteps. Junior was inducted 
into the University’s Hall of Fame in 2009. 
The San Diego Chargers drafted Junior 
Seau in the first round of the NFL Draft, as the 
5th overall pick in 1990. He quickly became 
the heart and soul of the Chargers’ defense 
and led the Chargers to their first and only 
Super Bowl appearance four years later. He 
was voted the Chargers’ Most Inspirational 
Player in 1997 and again in 2002. These rec-
ognitions exemplify Junior’s ability to inspire 
and 
motivate 
his 
teammates and dem-
onstrates the role he played on the team. 
Junior went on to play 20 seasons in the 
NFL, 13 with the Chargers, three with the 
Miami Dolphins, and finished his career in 
New England with the Patriots. In all, he to-
taled 1,849 tackles, 56.5 sacks, and 18 inter-
ceptions. Junior was named the NFL Defen-
sive Player of the Year in 1992 and 1998, the 
Chargers’ Most Valuable Player six times, and 
was named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of 
the 1990s. He is widely considered one of the 
best linebackers in NFL history. 
While his contributions to sports history are 
numerous, Junior’s leadership extended be-
yond the gridiron. Junior Seau was a pas-
sionate humanitarian who cared deeply about 
giving back to his community. He established 
the Junior Seau Foundation in 1992 to support 
San Diego youth, and the Foundation has 
since given more than $5 million to community 
organizations. In 2015, the Foundation do-
nated $500,000 to Rady Children’s North 
Coastal Center in Oceanside which enabled 
the expansion of pediatric urgent care and 
specialty services. In 2016, the organization 
gave $250,000 to UC San Diego to support 
brain injury research and education. The Jun-
ior Seau Foundation has also provided schol-
arships and gifts to underprivileged children 
throughout the region. 
Madam Speaker, Junior Seau was an ex-
ceptional individual, and I am honored to 
share part of his story today. To his family, 
friends, and all who knew him, supported him, 
and cheered for him over the years, I share in 
the celebration of his life at the 10th Anniver-
sary of his passing. 
Junior was a light in our community, and we 
miss him. His legacy lives on and will never 
be forgotten.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
CENTEN-
NIAL CELEBRATION OF GRANITE 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and lasting contribu-
tions of Robert Ikeda. Robert Kimihiko ‘‘Bob’’ 
Ikeda, born July 5, 1934, in the Japanese- 
American fishing community of Terminal Island 
in Los Angeles County, CA to Kameichi and 
Hayako (Yuoka) Ikeda, passed away on No-
vember 24, 2020. He was preceded in death 
by his eldest son, Patrick Ikeda, sister Sumiko 
‘‘Sumy,’’ and brother-in-law Don Anhorn. He is 
survived by his loving wife of 60 years, Glad-
ys, whom he met while they both attended UC 
Berkeley. Other survivors include son Steve 
and daughter-in-law Kathy Ikeda, grand-
children Justin and Andrea, daughter-in-law 
Terrilynne Ikeda, step-grandchildren Calvin 
and Samantha, sister Shizuka ‘‘Margaret’’ 
Kono 
and 
husband 
Ryoichiro, 
brother 
Nobuhiko ‘‘Noby’’ Ikeda and wife Susie, and 
numerous nieces and nephews. 
Bob—a U.S. born citizen—was incarcerated 
as an ‘‘enemy non-alien’’ at the age of seven 
in 1942, along with the rest of his family and 
120,000 other Japanese and Japanese Ameri-
cans who had been living along the west 
coast. They remained confined under military 
armed guard for the duration of World War II, 
first at Jerome and Rohwer in Arkansas, and 
then at Tule Lake Segregation Center in Cali-
fornia. The Ikeda family settled outside Lodi 
after their release in early 1946. He attended 
area schools and graduated from Lodi High 
School. 
Bob was a veteran of the United States 
Army and was proud to receive a Top-Secret 
security clearance as a soldier, which came 
from the same government that wrongly 
deemed him a national security risk during his 
childhood. When he was stationed in Ger-
many, he used that clearance while analyzing 
aerial intelligence photos taken during the 
Cold War, some of which were among the first 
taken by the U2 spy plane. 
After being honorably discharged from the 
Army, Bob resumed his career with the De-
partment of Public Works, Division of High-
ways (which became Caltrans), where he was 
the State’s first licensed traffic engineer. He 
spent his 42-year career with the Caltrans 
Stockton office, at first on construction crews, 
and later in Traffic Management. As the Chief 
of Traffic Management, Bob was the de facto 
traffic engineer for numerous smaller cities 
throughout the district. 
While he was incarcerated at Tule Lake, 
Bob began studying judo, a sport he later in-
troduced to his sons. He eventually was pro-
moted by the United States Judo Federation 
to third-degree black belt and spent several 
years teaching an afternoon judo program at 
Stockton Judo Club. 
Bob had a lifelong passion for cars, starting 
even before he received his first junior oper-
ator permit at age 12. He purchased his first 
Porsche in 1961 and owned several through-
out his life; he even put a Porsche engine in 
a Volkswagen bus. He shared his passion for 
cars with Clyde Wilbourn, who came into his 
life as his mechanic, but soon became a val-
ued 
and 
long-time 
friend. 
Bob 
enjoyed 
autocrossing and rallying competitively as well 
as taking cross-country driving vacations and 
meandering drives to destinations unknown 
even to him. His connection to Porsche was 
strengthened by his lifelong membership in the 
Porsche Club of America. 
Although Bob lost his appetite toward the 
end, anyone who knows him will not be sur-
prised by his last meal: a bowl of vanilla ice 
cream with a dollop of whipped cream. 
The family plans a post-pandemic memorial 
observance. Donations in Bob’s memory may 
be made to the Tule Lake Committee, the 
Stockton/San Joaquin Emergency Food Bank, 
St. Mary’s Dining Room, or a charity of choice.

RECOGNIZING JOE MAYER’S LIFE-
TIME COMMITMENT TO ADVANC-
ING AMERICA’S SECURITY AND 
HIS ADVOCACY FOR AMERICA’S 
MISSION IN SPACE 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize a constituent from Florida’s Space 
Coast who has dedicated his career to ad-
vancing the strategic security of our nation 
and strengthening America’s technological ca-
pability, and who has been a well-known and 
passionate advocate of our mission in space— 
Mr. Joe Mayer. 
In 1976, Joe graduated from William 
Paterson College in New Jersey, then at-
tended Georgetown University, and earned a 
Master of Science of Foreign Service degree 
focusing on national security. He got his start 
working on Capitol Hill as an aide to U.S. Sen-
ator Jake Garn of Utah, advising on defense 
and national security issues and helping to 
support the B–1B strategic bomber as well as 
funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
Joe then went on to serve on the staff of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence fo-
cusing on arms control. 
In 1986, Joe joined Rockwell International 
taking the lead on Rockwell’s NASA space-re-
lated business. He worked to modernize the 
Space Shuttle program and became a leading 
advocate for the International Space Station. 
Joe later worked for The Boeing Company 
supporting their human space exploration ef-
forts. He became the Chair of Citizens for 
Space Exploration, a pro-NASA, pro-space ad-
vocacy organization, received a NASA Space 
Flight Awareness award from the Boeing lead-
ership team, and was named an Associate 
Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics. 
In 2007 Joe joined the Lockheed Martin 
Space team in Houston representing the com-
pany in the community and advocating on be-
half of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)/ 
Orion spacecraft. He worked with community 
partners and traveled across the country 
meeting with the public, school children, com-
munity leaders and elected officials explaining 
the value of human space exploration. The 
Houston Mayor and City Council honored Joe 
for his professional and community contribu-
tions with a Declaration designating February 
26, 2013, as ‘Joe Mayer Day in the City of 
Houston’. 
In 2013 Lockheed Martin dispatched Joe to 
Florida’s Space Coast where he has served 
the space community in numerous civic and 
charitable positions and has been a leading 
voice for our nation’s space program. Joe’s 
local leadership roles have included Chairing 
the board of the Economic Development Com-
mission of Florida’s Space Coast, Chairing the 
Cocoa Beach Chamber as well as Chair of 
VISIT Florida and Space Coast Citizens for 
Space Exploration. He has served on the 
Boards of Brevard Cultural Alliance, Florida 
Defense Contractors Association, the Astro-
naut Memorial Foundation, and the Astronaut 
Scholarship Foundation. He is a member of 
the Space Coast Civilian-Military Association 
and serves on my Congressional Space Advi-
sory Committee. 
After more than 40 years of service, Joe re-
cently announced his plans to retire, and we 
thank him for his tireless service and commit-
ment to our communities, and for his strong 
advocacy and support for our nation’s space 
program. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Joe Mayer and wishing him and 
his family well in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING 
DR. 
KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
RENTON TECHNICAL COLLEGE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to congratulate Dr. Kevin McCarthy on 
his retirement from Renton Technical College. 
He has served many years as an educator 
and as a leader in our community. 
Kevin has continually demonstrated his 
commitment to education. He brought his tal-
ents to the Pacific Northwest where he served 
as vice president of instruction at the Lake 
Washington Institute of Technology, dean of 
the Health Sciences, Education & Wellness In-
stitute at Bellevue College, and associate vice 
president of instruction at Blue Mountain Com-
munity College prior to joining Renton Tech-
nical College. 
Kevin is well known throughout the commu-
nity as the president of Renton Technical Col-
lege. He has served as a strong and pas-
sionate leader in this role since 2015. Kevin 
has always emphasized the importance of in-
clusion and prioritized equitable access to 
education during his time as president. His 
focus on equity goes beyond the classroom. 
Kevin serves the community as part of the 
Puget Sound Coalition for College & Career 
Readiness and as a member of the Renton 
Mayor’s Inclusion Task Force. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely thank and com-
mend Dr. Kevin McCarthy for the tireless work 
he’s done to educate and support learners in 
the Puget Sound region. I congratulate him 
and wish him a happy retirement.

HONORING DOCTOR JOEL STUART 
BLOOM AS A DISTINGUISHED ED-
UCATOR IN NEW JERSEY 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Dr. Joel Stuart Bloom upon his 
retirement as the eighth President of the New 
Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). 
As a premier public university, NJIT plays a 
crucial role in shaping the economic trajectory 
of our state. It is also a school with the highest 
student mobility and, therefore, exemplifies the 
American Dream. I recall attending President 
Bloom’s inauguration in 2012 when I served 
as the President of Newark’s Municipal Coun-
cil. At the ceremony, I voiced my optimism 
that the university would flourish under Presi-
dent Bloom’s vision and forward-thinking 
ideas. 
As he now steps down and begins the next 
chapter of his life, I can confidently express 
my pride in President Bloom’s leadership. 
Under his leadership, the school accomplished 
numerous significant feats, including a two-fold 
increase in enrollment, the expansion of re-
search, the improvement of minority students’ 
access to STEM education, and the formation 
of numerous commercial and industry partner-
ships. His notable contributions will leave a 
long-lasting imprint for generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in expressing gratitude to President 
Bloom for his esteemed commitment to the 
growth and development of NJIT, the city of 
Newark, and our great Nation.

Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
salute and offer my gratitude to my departing 
Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Di-
rector, Patrick Malone, as he departs govern-
ment service for other opportunities. 
Patrick has faithfully served as a staffer in 
the House of Representatives for more than a 
decade, acting to preserve the values en-
shrined in the Constitution and striving to ex-
pand rights for all Americans. 
During his tenure, Patrick has helped give 
voice to those who are too often left out of the 
conversation: victims of gun violence, domes-
tic abuse, and hate crimes. I know that as his 
career advances he will find ways to advocate 
for these causes and many others in whatever 
way he can. Most especially, he has done all 
of this with care, good humor and with a com-
mitment to mentoring others committed to 
public service. 
As he leaves, I wish the best for Patrick, his 
wife, Cindy, and sons, Ronan and Seamus. I 
am proud to convey my thanks for his service.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JOHN HEUBUSCH 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the retirement and 
commend the service of John Heubusch, an 
individual who has spent decades in both the 
private and public sector and who, for the past 
13 years, has played a pivotal role in the 
growth and revitalization of one of the jewels 
of our nation: the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Library. After guiding this prestigious institution 
through the challenges of the past decade, he 
will be enjoying his well-deserved retirement. 
A native of our nation’s capital, John 
Heubusch spent his college years in the D.C.- 
Maryland-Virginia 
area 
studying 
political 
science and receiving a master’s degree in 
National Security Studies from Georgetown 
University. John started his career in public 
service nearly forty years ago working as an 
analyst for the Department of the Air Force. 
He soon moved to Capitol Hill, serving as a 
staffer for Congressman Denny Smith, where 
he quickly ascended the ranks to become his

Chief of Staff and working directly with Con-
gressman Smith to trim down wasteful Depart-
ment of Defense spending and maximize the 
efficiency and the safety of the military under 
the Reagan administration. Under the Bush 
administration, John served as the Chief of 
Staff to Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole be-
fore becoming the Vice President of Commu-
nications of the American Red Cross, one of 
the largest and oldest non-profit humanitarian 
organizations in the world. In these roles, from 
the Pentagon to Capitol Hill, to the Red Cross, 
John embodied what it means to serve one’s 
country and be a faithful advocate for the 
greater good. 
After impressive stints in the campaign and 
corporate worlds, John was personally se-
lected by former First Lady Nancy Reagan 
and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Founda-
tion and Institute Board of Trustees to serve 
as Executive Director. In this role John led this 
organization, which oversees the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library, into a new era of 
success and fostered renewed respect for 
President Reagan’s legacy. Under his leader-
ship, the Reagan Foundation championed the 
same values that President Reagan em-
bodied, including charity, private goodwill, and 
free enterprise. Additionally, the Reagan Li-
brary under John educated a new generation 
of Americans about the life, presidency, and 
ideals of President Reagan. Leaving the 
Reagan Foundation with a historic $250 mil-
lion endowment as he enters the next chapter 
of his life, John has provided an invaluable 
service to our community and our nation, as 
the Reagan Foundation, Institute, and Library 
remains well equipped to face the years 
ahead and continue their critical mission in 
preserving the legacy of one of our greatest 
presidents. 
I cannot commend John Heubusch enough 
for his service to California’s 25th District and 
the Nation. We thank him for his stewardship 
of President Reagan’s legacy, and while we 
will miss him, his retirement and the oppor-
tunity to—spend—more time with friends and 
loved ones is certainly deserved after a long 
and successful career.

TRIBUTE TO DREW TROJANOWSKI 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, today I 
wish to recognize the service and career of 
Drew Trojanowski, who has a long record of 
service to National Security and our Nation’s 
veterans. 
Mr. Trojanowski served in the U.S. Army 
from 2006 to 2015, most notably as a sniper. 
Mr. Trojanowski deployed to both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan in support of the Global War on Ter-
rorism; also serving as a combat advisor to a 
foreign military in the realms of operations, 
tactics, intelligence, and civil affairs. He con-
cluded his military career serving in the Ari-
zona Army National Guard, where he helped 
develop long-range plans for the Joint Counter 
Narco-Terrorism Task Force. 
Mr. Trojanowski began serving veterans in 
2015, after returning from Afghanistan, at the 
Mesa Chamber of Commerce; he established 
the Mesa Veterans Program and Mesa Indus-
try and Defense Council, a consortium of more 
than 70 aerospace and defense companies. 
Mr. Trojanowski’s career with U.S. Senator 
John McCain initiated in 2016 as a military 
and veteran advocate, where traveled through-
out Arizona interfacing with veterans, DoD in-
stillations and personnel and industry. 
In December of 2016, Senator McCain 
asked Mr. Trojanowski to be his Military Legis-
lative Assistant and senior policy advisor. In 
that role, he was at the forefront of advocating 
for reform, resources, funding, and benefits 
that our military and veterans earned and de-
serve. 
During his time with Senator McCain, Mr. 
Trojanowski helped champion the writing and 
passage of significant legislation impacting 
American servicemembers families and vet-
erans. These include the VA Mission Act, Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, the VA Ap-
peals Modernization Act, the VA Accountability 
and Whistleblower Protection Act, the Harry 
W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance 
Act—also known as the Forever G.I. Bill—and 
the Veteran Overmedication and Prevention 
Act. These bipartisan bills, all of which were 
signed into law, serve as Mr. Trojanowski’s 
dedication and leadership on behalf of the 
military and veterans. 
In 2018, Mr. Trojanowski joined the White 
House as a Presidentially Commissioned Offi-
cer and Special Assistant to the President on 
the Domestic Policy Council. In this role he 
oversaw the Departments of Veteran Affairs, 
Defense, NASA and Labor. During his tenure, 
Mr. Trojanowski was the policy lead on three 
executive orders and 56 regulations, including 
the implementation MISSION Act and the 
PREVENTS initiative. 
It 
is 
my 
honor 
to 
recognize 
Mr. 
Trojanowski’s outstanding military service and 
continued service to our military, veterans, and 
their families. As Mr. Trojanowski begins a 
new chapter, I have no doubt that he will con-
tinue to be a voice for all those who serve.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA COURTS AND PUB-
LIC 
DEFENDER 
SERVICE 
VOL-
UNTARY 
SEPARATION 
INCEN-
TIVE PAYMENTS ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts and 
Public Defender Service Voluntary Separation 
Incentive Payments Act. This bill, which 
passed the House in the 114th Congress, 
would make a small but important change to 
the authorities of the District of Columbia 
Courts (D.C. Courts) and the Public Defender 
Service for the District of Columbia (PDS), giv-
ing them the same authority federal agencies 
and federal courts already have to offer vol-
untary separation incentive payments, or 
buyouts, to their employees. 
Congress has provided this authority to the 
D.C. Courts and PDS on an annual basis in 
the last several appropriations bills. However, 
my bill is necessary to make this authority per-
manent. This authority would allow the D.C. 
Courts and PDS to respond to future adminis-
trative and budgetary needs, and would pro-
vide the flexibility to extend buyout offers to 
their employees. 
The U.S. Government Accountability Office 
has opined that voluntary separation incentive 
payments may be made only where statutorily 
authorized. Federal agencies and federal 
courts already have permanent statutory au-
thority to offer buyouts, and there is no reason 
why the D.C. Courts and PDS, which are both 
federally funded entities, should not have the 
same permanent authority to manage their 
workforce as budget conditions and needs 
change. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation.

REMEMBERING LUKE WILLIAM 
ALBRIGHT 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 5, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Luke William Albright, who 
passed away on Friday, June 17, 2022, at the 
young age of 11. 
A resident of Bay Village, Luke was born on 
April 28, 2011, to Ryan and Megan Albright. 
Despite his fight with neuroblastoma, Luke 
remained true to his core: generous, loving, 
outgoing, and spirited. When he was feeling 
good, he would spend his time outside, riding 
his bike and playing with friends. If the weath-
er wasn’t up to par, you could find Luke enjoy-
ing his time with video games. If not that, then 
you could see him catching up on his favor-
ites, anything Spiderman or Star Wars. One 
who loved to give, Luke commonly bought 
gifts for his friends and made sure to prioritize 
spending time with his family. 
Luke leaves behind to pay forward his love, 
his parents, Ryan and Megan Albright; older 
brother Liam Albright; grandparents Alan and 
Noreen (nee Doyle) Albright and William Col-
lins and Deanna Klosinski. He is also survived 
by aunts and uncles, Rory and Mandy 
Albright, Andrew and Kristen Albright, Nora 
and Chris Zabik, and Edward and Meghan 
Collins; cousins Breana, Grant, Evie, Sonny, 
Rose, Clara, Bianca, Ivan, and Marcus; his 
furry friends Molly, Pete, Frank, Giuseppe and 
most especially Oppa; and all of his friends at 
Westerly Elementary and the Bay Village 
Schools. Greeting Luke on the other side was 
his grandmother Leanne (nee Challenger) Col-
lins. 
Luke fought his battle with neuroblastoma 
with a level of courage that can rival the 
strongest of us in this room. Even though 
Luke’s journey was short, the love he left will 
be everlasting and the light he made will con-
tinue to burn bright. To his family, I pray for 
peace over time because I know this is a pain 
that one can never rid themselves of.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E694 
July 5, 2022 
Senator Pilar Diaz Cruz Lujan. Senator Lujan 
was an esteemed leader, devoted educator, 
and tireless advocate for the People of Guam. 
Our community will fondly remember her as a 
visionary whose resilience, resolve, and com-
mitment to others transformed both the face 
and future of our island. 
Across a lifetime of service, Senator Lujan 
persisted in her pursuit of an improved quality 
of life for all who call our island home. After 
graduating from George Washington High 
School in 1951, Senator Lujan earned a bach-
elor’s degree in Secondary Education, a Juris 
Doctor, a master’s degree in Elementary 
School Administration, an Education Specialist 
degree in General School Administration, and 
license as an Educational Research Consult-
ant—all of which were fundamental to the 
work she realized over the years. Navigating 
an extensive career within Guam’s education 
system, Senator Lujan served as a teacher, 
principal of Wettengel Elementary School, As-
sistant Superintendent of Curriculum and In-
struction, Associate Superintendent, Acting Di-
rector of Education, and Chairwoman of 
Guam’s first-ever Board of Education. Through 
these roles she spearheaded vital initiatives 
and reinvestment into CHamoru language 
learning and culture programs that shape the 
experiences of our youth to this very day. 
Moreover, her added contributions as a 
CHamoru Language Instructor at the Univer-
sity of Guam, translator for the Guam Con-
stitution, 
and 
CHamoru 
newscaster 
with 
Guam’s Public Broadcasting Radio Station 
(KGTF) have strengthened our collective mis-
sion to revitalize and preserve our native 
tongue. 
With an unwavering passion for the people 
and determination to make a difference, Sen-
ator Lujan carried her fight for equity and jus-
tice into the realm of politics. Elected to serve 
6 consecutive terms in the Guam Legislature, 
she championed policies that have meaning-
fully elevated our institutions and continue to 
inform generations of leaders. Most notably, 
her achievements include the establishment of 
the Supreme Court of Guam, Jury and Ap-
pointed Counsel Trust Funds, Judicial Building 
Fund to construct the Guam Judicial Center, 
and the Crime Victims Bill of Rights as well as 
the enactment of the Child Protective and 
Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Acts and 
Reactivation of the Criminal Injuries Com-
pensation Commission. Further, she testified 
in front of the Federal War Claims Commis-
sion to advance CHamoru WWII survivor res-
titution and served as Chair of our Senatorial 
Committees on Judiciary and Criminal Justice, 
Corrections, Economic Development, Housing 
and Community Development, Federal & For-
eign Affairs, and Health, Welfare and Ecology. 
Outside of her elected and appointed duties, 
however, Senator Lujan also made it a point 
to dedicate her knowledge, tools, and per-
spective to countless organizations such as 
the Salvation Army, Democratic Party of 
Guam, Soroptimist International of Guam, 
Guam Women’s Issues Task Force, Inter-
national Women’s Club of Guam, Phi Delta 
Kappa Society, and Catholic Daughters of 
America. By 2015, she was awarded the pres-
tigious Hustisia Award in recognition of her 
decades of distinguished service. 
Senator Lujan is an icon of public service 
and CHamoru excellence who continues to in-
spire many throughout our island to similarly 
rise in response to the needs of one’s commu-
nity. As part of the Greatest Generation of 
Guam, she admirably emerged as an agent of 
change and channeled a war-inflicted history 
of despair into unyielding purpose, and I join 
the People of Guam in remembering and cele-
brating her life and legacy of empowering 
CHamoru voices while promoting good gov-
ernance and uncompromising justice. My fam-
ily and I wish to extend our hearts and prayers 
for Senator Pilar Diaz Cruz Lujan, her family, 
and friends. Though Senator Lujan will be 
deeply missed, she will be welcomed at the 
Heavenly Gates by her dear husband, Senator 
Frank G. Lujan, daughter, Justice Monessa 
Lujan, parents, and siblings, and her love and 
memories will forever remain in the hearts of 
the People of Guam.
