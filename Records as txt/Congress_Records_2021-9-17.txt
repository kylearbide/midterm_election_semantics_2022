PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, reveal Your word to 
us today. May it shine light in the 
darkness which threatens our sense of 
personal and national security. May it 
provide understanding in the midst of a 
country wrought with turmoil and con-
fusion. 
We wait with deep anticipation, even 
yearning, for a word from You today. 
Turn and reveal Yourself to us, and in 
that holy moment, in that instance 
when we are keenly aware of Your 
presence in our lives, bless us with an 
appreciation of the vastness of Your 
love and care for us. 
From that glance, may each of us be 
so filled with gratitude that from the 
depths of our souls we would be moved 
to respond with our own diligence and 
desire to obey You and to find ways to 
love even our adversaries, even those 
whom we truly believe would do us 
harm. 
Establish our footsteps this day. Re-
deem our feeble efforts and transform 
the inadequacy of our endeavors to 
serve You as we serve this country. 
Make Your face to shine upon us and 
smile upon us with favor so that all 
that we set out to do will have Your 
blessing and would be worthy of our 
service to You. 
In the strength of Your sovereign 
name we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING GENERAL STEPHEN 
R. LYONS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor and privilege to pay tribute to an out-
standing leader and warrior, Army General 
Stephen R. Lyons, Commander of U.S. Trans-
portation Command. General Lyons is soon 
retiring, having served this great Nation for 38 
years and completing a most distinguished ca-
reer. 
General Lyons graduated from Rochester 
Institute of Technology in 1983, where he re-
ceived a degree in Criminology. He began his 
career in Germany during the Cold War and 
subsequently held a wide range of operational 
assignments to include command at company, 
battalion, brigade, and major command levels. 
Since 2003, he has spent over 40 months de-
ployed to the U.S. Central Command area of 
responsibility in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He 
often speaks of his time in command of the 
703d Main Support Battalion, 3d Infantry Divi-
sion at Fort Stewart, Georgia as being one of 
his most rewarding assignments. While in 
command, his battalion provided mission crit-
ical necessary support during the initial ‘‘thun-
der run’’ into Iraq in 2003. 
A constant voice of reason, motivation, and 
inspiration, General Lyons has devoted his life 
to this Nation. He has provided sound counsel 
to leaders at all levels, and built trust with the 
American people through his impressive ac-
tions. I have personally sought his advice, as 
have my colleagues. The Members of this 
Chamber and workers across many parts of 
the Federal Government will miss his leader-
ship and candor. 
General Lyons’ illustrious career is culmi-
nating with his current position, where he 
leads the 144,000 men and women of U.S. 
Transportation Command. He is responsible 
for coordinating the Department of Defense’s 
global deployment and distribution enterprise. 
His transformational leadership has bolstered 
warfighter readiness, increased cyber aware-
ness and security, and prepared the Depart-
ment of Defense for challenging transportation 
and logistics missions in the future. General 
Lyons’ leadership abilities were on full display 
as he successfully oversaw the largest Non- 
combatant Evacuation Operation airlift in U.S. 
history. He challenged deliberate planning as-
sumptions from day one and compelled the 
Joint Force to adapt and evolve for the dy-
namic and uncertain operating environment of 
tomorrow. 
In addition to General Lyons’ service, 
Maureen, his wife of 32 years, also selflessly 
served this great Nation. She devoted her life 
to caring for families under his command and 
in their community. I cannot overstate the im-
portance of the support the spouses and fami-
lies provide to their service members in our 
Armed Forces. Service and sacrifice are not 
limited to just the service member, but often 
extend to the entire family. On behalf of the 
U.S. Congress and a grateful Nation, we thank 
Maureen and their children, Kara and Dylan, 
for their continued and dedicated service to 
our military and our Nation. Although the Army 
will say goodbye to General Lyons and 
Maureen, we know that the Lyons family’s leg-
acy and devotion to the service of this great 
Nation will continue for years to come. 
I would like to help close out the final chap-
ter of this inspiring Soldier and Joint Force 
leader’s career with a heartfelt thank you from 
all the men and women of the U.S. Congress 
and Nation. General Lyons, Godspeed. We 
thank you, Maureen, and the entire Lyons 
family, for your service over a remarkable 38- 
year career. We wish you well in your future 
endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND MUSIC 
OF MR. JEFF STICE 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of my friend, 
Mr. Jeff Stice, who went to be with the Lord 
unexpectedly on September 14, 2021, at the 
age of 61. 
Mr. Stice, affectionately known as ‘Mr. Piano 
Man,’ was a multi-award-winning gospel music 
pianist with a prolific music career. He first laid 
hands on a piano as a young boy, and quickly 
showed a great talent on the instrument. At 
the age of fifteen, Jeff played for his first gos-
pel quartet, alongside his father. He went on 
to study piano at Western Kentucky University, 
where he refined his natural talent and gained 
an even greater appreciation for music. Short-
ly thereafter, he began to venture into gospel 
music professionally. During his early career, 
he played with the Blackwood Brothers, the 
Rex Nelon Singers, and Perfect Heart, and 
appeared alongside countless other gospel 
groups, including the legendary Oak Ridge 
Boys, as well as venturing into solo per-
forming. Jeff later helped form the Triumphant 
Quartet at Louise Mandrell’s music theater in 
Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Mr. Stice spent 
twelve years playing with Triumphant, during 
which 
time 
he 
was 
inducted 
into 
the 
Edmonson County Music Hall of Fame, in his 
hometown of Brownsville, Kentucky, and co- 
produced the Grammy-nominated album Ev-
eryday. In 2016, he was inducted into the 
GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame for his ear-
lier work with the Rex Nelon Singers. His ca-
reer as a solo musician earned him the honor 
of performing at Carnegie Hall, the U.S. Cap-
itol, and other esteemed venues throughout 
the country. 
In 2014, Jeff rededicated his life to Christ 
and began to focus more intimately on his re-
lationship with God. He continued to perform 
as a solo musician, pianist, and producer for 
countless gospel groups, with the mission of 
using music to convey his unshakeable faith in 
the Lord. 
Jeff is survived by his loving wife Stacey 
and their four children. He will be greatly 
missed, not only by his family and in his com-
munity, but by gospel music fans everywhere. 
On behalf of the 11th Congressional District of 
Georgia, and the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, I offer my heartfelt condolences 
and prayers to Mr. Jeff Stice’s family and com-
mend the legacy he leaves to his family and 
friends and the entire gospel music world.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF TOMMY WEAVER 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Tommy Weaver, a lifelong na-
tive of East Texas, who passed away recently 
at the age of 70. 
On April 26, 1951, Tommy was born to 
Charlie ‘‘CC’’ Chester and Winnie Bell Weaver 
in Jasper, Texas. His father worked at Keller 
Industries, and his mother worked in the food

service department at Woodville ISD. Tommy 
was truly blessed to have one of the best 
cooks in Southeast Texas as his mother, and 
his meals were southern-style home-cooking 
for the whole family. Tommy loved the holi-
days, as it was a time when his family came 
together to enjoy his mother’s meals and each 
other’s company at the old home place. 
While attending Kirby High School, Tommy 
was actively involved in sports, As a teenager, 
he developed a love of hunting. Tommy felt 
blessed to have been raised in East Texas, 
surrounded by nature and wildlife. On any 
given day, you could find him fishing in ‘‘Dam 
B’’, swimming in Wolf Creek lake, or chasing 
squirrels. Being the baby of the family, there 
was a never a dull moment and always plenty 
to do. 
In 1973, Tommy graduated from Lamar Uni-
versity with a bachelor’s in accounting. Shortly 
after, Tommy married the love of his life, 
Kathy Harriett Tolar. They started their lives 
together in Beaumont, TX, where he worked 
with Edgar and Kiker, CPAs. After a few 
years, Tommy and Kathy returned home to 
Woodville, where Tommy established his ac-
counting firm, Weaver and Smith, CPAs. In 
1987, he began working at Woodville ISD as 
the Assistant Superintendent of Finance, 
where he would spend the next 23 years be-
fore his retirement. 
After he was retired, Tommy continued to 
do what he liked best: hunting, golfing, and 
watching his grandchildren play. He also en-
joyed utilizing his financial expertise volun-
teering with numerous organizations such as 
First Baptist Church, Jacob’s Ladder Learning 
Center, the Lions Club, and Allan Shivers Li-
brary. Additionally, Tommy served on the 
board of Tyler County Hospital and ultimately 
became Chairman. 
Tommy made life-long friends over his 43 
years of membership in the Woodville Lions 
Club, including honors such as: the Out-
standing Lion of the Year, Long Time Service, 
Lifetime Membership in Texas Lions Camp, 
and the prestigious Melvin Jones Fellowship 
Award. Tommy recently received a Certificate 
of Appreciation for his outstanding commit-
ment and dedication to service, which was 
presented to his sons on his behalf. 
Early in life, Tommy’s mother instilled in him 
the love of his Lord and Savior, and as a 
young boy he attended Ebenezer Baptist 
Church. Tommy later led his family to become 
members of the First Baptist Church of Wood-
ville, where he served as trustee and a dea-
con. Tommy thoroughly enjoyed his men’s 
Sunday school class and occasionally filled in 
as the teacher, using his passion and thought-
fulness to deliver the weekly lesson. 
Tommy’s primary devotion throughout life 
was the growth and support of his family. He 
spent many years coaching his three boys in 
various sports. While not on the sports field, 
they could usually be found out enjoying na-
ture with their father. Nothing brought Tommy 
more pleasure than taking his boys hunting 
and ‘‘bringing home the meat.’’ The time spent 
together in sports and outdoors is where 
Tommy instilled in his boys the same values 
and faith that guided him throughout his life. 
Tommy and Kathy were both blessed to have 
the privilege of watching their three boys grow 
to be leaders within their communities. 
Tommy and Kathy both enjoyed traveling. 
One of their most memorable trips was to Ath-
ens, 
Greece, 
where 
they 
visited 
the 
Areopagus (Mars Hill) where Paul the Apostle 
gave his most famous message. Tommy es-
pecially enjoyed reading the books of the Bible 
written by Paul. 
Tommy’s greatest love was his family and 
seven grandchildren, who lovingly called him 
‘‘Pops.’’ The beloved family dog, Toto, always 
knew when Pops was home and frequently 
landed in his lap for a cuddle. Tommy is re-
membered by his family as ‘‘an oak tree . . . 
strong, mighty, and courageous.’’ 
He was preceded in death by his parents, 
Charlie ‘‘CC’’ and Winnie Bell Weaver, and his 
sister Virginia Carruth. He is survived by his 
devoted wife of 46 years, Kathy Tolar Weaver 
of Doucette; sons, Travis and wife Jamie of 
Doucette, Ryan and wife Amanda of Lum-
berton, Lane and wife Amber of Kingwood; 
grandchildren, Reed, Laural, Tyler, Karson, 
Lathan, Lucas, and Blake; brothers, Charley 
and wife Diana of San Antonio, Kenneth and 
wife Charlotte of Woodville; sister, Barbara 
Wilson of Woodville, as well as numerous 
nephews and nieces. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor my 
friend Tommy Weaver for his many years of 
faithful service to his community. My thoughts 
and prayers remain with his family and friends 
during this difficult time.

CELE-
BRATES 
HISPANIC 
HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I rise to cel-
ebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month. 
From September 15, 2021 to October 15, 
2021, the people of the United States will 
once again celebrate the histories, cultures, 
traditions, and contributions of our Hispanic 
American community. As a lifelong resident of 
Northwest Indiana, in honor of this special 
month, I would like to pay tribute to two truly 
outstanding local Hispanic community leaders, 
the late Jesse Gomez and Rosemarie Gomez. 
Jesse Gomez was born on April 5, 1920 in 
East Chicago, Indiana. He was elected East 
Chicago City Councilman in 1963, making him 
the first person of Hispanic descent to be 
elected to political office in the city, as well as 
in the state of Indiana. Mr. Gomez served 
three consecutive terms as councilman and 
was elected Council President twice during his 
tenure. His election and time in office was es-
pecially significant in that it opened political 
doors for the Hispanic community throughout 
the city of East Chicago and beyond. During 
his career, Jesse was also appointed Manager 
of the East Chicago License Bureau and 
served as Deputy Clerk in the Lake County 
Treasurer’s office and Assistant Deputy for the 
Lake County Assessor’s office. Jesse Gomez 
passed away on August 31, 1979, leaving an 
indelible mark in Northwest Indiana’s history. 
He is survived by his wife, Rosemarie, four 
beloved children and many grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. Throughout his life, Mr. 
Gomez successfully advocated for the inter-
ests and rights of the Hispanic community 
throughout the region and the state. We are 
truly grateful for Jesse’s remarkable contribu-
tions, and his legacy will remain a cornerstone 
for the Hispanic community and for all of 
Northwest Indiana. 
Rosemarie Gomez was born on January 14, 
1926 in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico. As a child, 
her family traveled back and forth between 
Mexico and the United States. She and Jesse 
made their home in East Chicago, and after 
Jesse’s passing, Rosemarie was selected to 
replace him on the East Chicago City Council. 
This made her the first Hispanic female to 
serve in any political office in East Chicago. 
Throughout the years, Mrs. Gomez has given 
of her time and efforts to the city of East Chi-
cago and to the Hispanic community. The pur-
suit of quality education has always been of 
utmost importance to Rosemarie, and she has 
always made it a point to instill these values 
in her children and grandchildren. Throughout 
the years, she has dedicated much of her time 
to the East Chicago Public Library. Among her 
many projects with the library, for twenty years 
Mrs. Gomez volunteered to decorate a Mexi-
can-themed Christmas tree for the library’s 
‘‘Christmas Around the World’’ exhibit. For her 
dedication and commitment to the Hispanic 
community, and to the city of East Chicago 
and beyond, Rosemarie is worthy of our high-
est praise and everlasting gratitude. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask you and 
my other distinguished colleagues to join me 
in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. Our 
nation’s success is reliant upon the rich herit-
age and cultural diversity of its people, and 
the extraordinary contributions of citizens such 
as Jesse and Rosemarie Gomez, who have 
improved the quality of life for generations to 
come. This month, and always, we honor the 
many Hispanic members of our communities 
who have added to the prosperity of the 
United States and who have enriched our lives 
and the culture of our great nation.

HONORING PALM SPRINGS POLICE 
CHIEF BRIAN REYES 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the career of Palm Springs Police Chief 
Bryan Reyes who has retired after nearly 30 
years of service to our community. 
A veteran of the United States Marine 
Corps, Chief Reyes began his career in law 
enforcement as a reserve police officer for the 
Compton Police Department in 1991. After 
transferring to the Palm Springs Police Depart-
ment in 1993, he rose through the ranks— 
serving as an officer, detective, sergeant, lieu-
tenant, and captain before ultimately police 
chief. 
Chief Reyes led the Palm Springs Police 
Department through difficult times. On October 
8, 2016, during the first year of his tenure as 
Chief of Police, Palm Springs police officers 
Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega were trag-
ically killed in the line of duty. Chief Reyes 
recognized the devastating impact this would 
have on the department, community, and the 
officers’ families. He prioritized the mental 
health needs of those affected and his guid-
ance brought us all closer together in this time 
of mourning. 
I am honored to have collaborated with 
Chief Reyes in authoring legislation to com-
memorate the tremendous sacrifice made by

officers Zerebny and Vega that day. Named in 
their honor and inspired by our local police of-
ficers at the Palm Springs Police Department, 
the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega 
First Responders Survivors Support Act would 
get families of our fallen heroes the support 
they need to ensure they have every oppor-
tunity to succeed in life. 
During his more than six years of leader-
ship, Chief Reyes strengthened the depart-
ment’s community policing in neighborhoods, 
expanded outreach and engagement with resi-
dents and businesses through Town Hall 
meetings, implemented new technology and 
social media platforms, and fostered trust and 
credibility through regular meetings with neigh-
borhoods and community organizations. Under 
his guidance, the Palm Springs Police Depart-
ment developed important partnerships with 
the Palm Springs Unified School District, Palm 
Springs Chamber of Commerce, Main Street 
Palm Springs, Boys & Girls Club of Palm 
Springs, Mizell Senior Center, Well in the 
Desert, Desert Regional Medical Center, and 
many more local organizations. Further, Chief 
Reyes has received numerous accolades for 
his incredible leadership, including Life Saving 
Medals, the Officer of the Year award, and the 
Community Hero’s Award. 
Chief Reyes’ 28 years of tireless and dedi-
cated work for the Palm Springs community is 
a testament to his outstanding leadership, 
character, and commitment to the well-being 
of Palm Springs residents. 
Chief Reyes will be missed, and the 
changes brought about under his leadership 
will continue to improve the lives of Palm 
Springs police officers and the entire Palm 
Springs community. 
On behalf of the great people of California’s 
36th Congressional District I want to thank 
Chief Bryan Reyes for all he has done for our 
community. Congratulations on a well-de-
served retirement.

GORSUCH 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, on Saturday, 
August 14, 2021, Timothy (Tim) and Candace 
(Candy) Gorsuch of Leoti, Kansas, celebrated 
their 50th wedding anniversary in Stillwater, 
Oklahoma. They were joined by family and 
close friends for the occasion. 
Tim and Candy met on a blind date in Still-
water while Tim was playing baseball for Okla-
homa State University and Candy was a flight 
attendant for Continental Airlines. They were 
married in Colorado Springs in 1971 and were 
blessed with three children: Jack, Adrienne, 
and Matthew, and 6 grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Tim and Candy on this exciting oc-
casion. Happy 50th wedding anniversary. 
IN HONOR OF THE LEXINGTON 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the Lexington Fire Department as they 
celebrate 150 years of service to the people of 
Lexington, Kentucky. 
Lexington was founded in 1775 and quickly 
grew from a pioneer settlement into a village. 
Fire was a constant threat due to the number 
of wooden structures. The Lexington Fire 
Company was formed in May of 1790 and be-
came the first fire department west of the Alle-
gheny Mountains. Whenever a fire broke out 
in the early days of Lexington’s history, all the 
able-bodied men, and oftentimes women, 
would show up, form a bucket brigade, and at-
tempt to put out the fire. In August of 1871, 
two large fires destroyed significant portions of 
the city of Lexington. The Lexington Fire Com-
pany was then reorganized and the Lexington 
Fire Department as it is now known was cre-
ated on September 7, 1871. The Department 
grew over the years, adding innovations such 
as call boxes and fire hydrants. The first 
horseless engine in Lexington was purchased 
in 1911. Other innovations included new fire 
stations, employee physicals, truck mounted 
radios and first aid. The Department also 
began to introduce public education and pre-
vention efforts. 
Over the 150 years of its existence, the Lex-
ington Fire Department has protected the citi-
zens of Lexington by responding to the threat 
of property loss, injury, and death caused by 
fire. The Department has made numerous 
changes over time to provide the best and 
most up to date services to meet the changing 
needs of the community. 
Currently, the Lexington Fire Department 
serves as the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s 
largest fire department. They operate out of 24 
fire stations. They have responded to over 
304,000 local emergencies in the past 5 
years, with a current staff of 597 men and 
women and a budget of just over $80 million. 
In 2018, the Department began its innova-
tive and impressive Community Paramedicine 
Program, which enables firefighters to take a 
more comprehensive approach to the care of 
patients who depend highly on E–911. This is 
resulting in saving lives and making a dif-
ference for Fayette County residents. 
I congratulate chief Jason Wells and all the 
firefighters of the Lexington Fire Department 
on their 150th anniversary. It is my honor to 
remember the history and to recognize the 
brave men and women of the Lexington Fire 
Department before the United States Con-
gress.

IN RECOGNITION OF SYBIL 
SHAINWALD 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Sybil 
Shainwald, for her unwavering dedication to 
advocacy for women and especially for wom-
en’s health. For over forty years, Ms. 
Shainwald has been at the forefront of the 
women’s health movement. 
Ms. Shainwald received a Master of Arts in 
History from Columbia University in 1972 with 
a focus on the consumer movement. In 1972, 
she was awarded a National Endowment for 
the Humanities Grant to establish the Center 
for the Study of the Consumer Movement at 
the Consumers Union, which she directed 
from 1972–1978. While director, she attended 
New York Law School and received her Juris 
Doctor in 1976. 
As a trial assistant in the late 1970’s, Ms. 
Shainwald successfully represented the first 
case that held drug manufacturers liable for 
the health problems of children whose moth-
ers had taken the synthetic estrogen drug 
diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage. 
Since then, she has represented thousands of 
people in the U.S. and globally, who were ex-
posed in utero to DES. 
In addition to her courtroom advocacy, Ms. 
Shainwald was also a professor of law at the 
City University of New York and currently sits 
on the Board of Trustees of New York Law 
School. In 2004, she established the Sidney 
Shainwald Public Interest Lectures at New 
York Law School. 
Through her writing, testimony before the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Con-
gress, and her leadership of advocacy groups, 
Ms. Shainwald has raised national awareness 
of crucial women’s health issues. In the 
1980s, she traveled internationally to educate 
women on the toxicity of Depo-Provera, 
though not approved by the FDA for contra-
ceptive use, these birth control shots were 
marketed in 80 foreign countries and, through 
legal loopholes, to poor, minority, and mentally 
incapacitated 
women 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Ms. 
Shainwald estimated that 20,000 American 
women were prescribed this drug, linked to 
cancer in lab animals, as a contraceptive and 
to treat PMS and endometriosis, and were not 
told about its side effects. 
Ms. Shainwald is former Chair of the Na-
tional Women’s Health Network, Co-Founder 
of Health Action International and Trial Law-
yers for Public Justice. She was a member of 
the FDA Consumer Consortium and a member 
of the Coordinating Committee on Toxics and 
Drugs. 
She 
is 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
the 
Hysterectomy Educational Resources & Serv-
ices Foundation (HERS) and other non-profit 
organizations. Ms. Shainwald also recently 
helped establish an Immigration Clinic at the 
College of William & Mary Law School. 
Ms. Shainwald has received numerous 
awards for her advocacy, including the Presi-
dent’s Medal from New York Law School, the 
Dean’s Award from Columbia University, the 
Susan B. Anthony Award from the National 
Organization for Women, New York County 
Lawyer’s Association’s Edith I. Spivak Award 
and both New York Law School and William & 
Mary bestowed Honorary Doctor of Law De-
grees to her. Most recently, New York State 
Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright hon-
ored Ms. Shainwald with her annual Carolyn 
B. Maloney Leadership award. 
Ms. Shainwald has worked for decades as 
an advocate for women’s health and can be 
credited with many advances in the field. Her 
tireless advocacy has done nothing short of 
save lives.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RALPH 
MONACO 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask the Members of the House to join 
me in mourning the passing of Ralph Monaco, 
a highly talented and respected lawyer in the 
State of Connecticut, a devoted husband and 
father, and all-around outstanding citizen who 
cared for his community and always went 
above and beyond to help others. We trag-
ically lost Ralph on July 10, 2021 at the young 
age of 54. Ralph truly represented the best of 
eastern Connecticut and was a role model to 
so many in the field of law. His legacy and his 
leadership in private practice and in the public 
sphere will always be remembered and cher-
ished. 
Ralph was born in the Bronx in 1967 and 
spent most of his adolescence in the Big 
Apple. After exceling in his primary and sec-
ondary education, he decided to continue his 
education and attended Fordham University. 
While there—he made the decision that he 
would pursue a career in the field of law and 
chose to attend Quinnipiac Law School in 
North Haven, Connecticut, where his love for 
law truly flourished. After a successful aca-
demic career and graduation from law school 
in 1993—Ralph pursued his legal career and 
ventured to become a trial lawyer right here in 
eastern Connecticut. Through his determina-
tion and hard work, Ralph ascended in the 
field and became a partner at a firm right here 
in New London, CT at Conway, Londregan, 
Sheehan & Monaco P.C. 
His passion for the law eventually carried 
Ralph to becoming an active member of the 
Connecticut Bar Association (CBA). There, 
through his convivial personality and highly 
ethical and sophisticated knowledge of the 
law, he rose through the ranks and became 
the 87th and youngest President in the history 
of the CBA by 2010. With the CBA, he formed 
relationships with many public officials and led 
several initiatives within the organization in-
cluding his activity as the founder of the Civics 
Education Committee and serving as chair of 
the Modernizing Lawyer Referrals & Law Firm 
Models Subcommittee of the State of the 
Legal Profession Task Force; as well as the 
legislative liaison of the Litigation Section. 
Moreover—he was a crucial contributor to the 
CBA’s Volunteer Attorney Program which 
grants families and individuals in need access 
to pro-bono legal assistance. 
Ralph’s community involvement went far be-
yond his major contributions to the CBA. He 
served on the Jury Committee of the Chief 
Justice’s Public Safety and Trust Commission 
and was appointed by Connecticut Secretary 
of the State Denise W. Merrill to serve on the 
Civics Commission. He was also an active 
member of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers As-
sociation, Connecticut Bar Foundation, and 
New London County Bar Association. Ralph 
was an individual who gave all his energy to 
supporting the greater good and one cannot 
quantify all the lives he positively impacted 
with his contributions to our eastern Con-
necticut community through the field of law. 
We will be forever grateful for Ralph’s efforts 
and will work to carry his legacy of compas-
sion. 
Those who had the pleasure of working with 
Ralph attest to his tireless and focused work 
ethic. Ralph was a gentleman but not stuffy— 
he enjoyed a good laugh and was sensitive to 
anyone he interacted with. I had the pleasure 
to get to him know him during my years in the 
practice of law and as his Congressman. 
Ralph’s sudden and unexpected loss has left 
a void in Eastern Connecticut and the legal 
community. Madam Speaker, to that end, I 
again ask that my colleagues and this Cham-
ber to join me in expressing our deepest re-
spect for Ralph’s work and life and send our 
deepest condolences to the Monaco family. 
Ralph is survived by his wife Dina and daugh-
ters Abby and Anna—his sister Angela—and 
many other family members and friends who 
will carry the lasting memory of Ralph in their 
hearts.

AMERICAN TAMIL MEDICAL 
ASSOCIATION 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to honor the work of the Amer-
ican Tamil Medical Association, an organiza-
tion devoted to promoting charitable work both 
in the United States and around the world. 
Formed by ten Tamil physicians in 2005, 
ATMA has grown to include 13 chapters in 3 
countries. Its annual convention brings to-
gether the brightest minds in the Tamil med-
ical community to share ideas and initiate 
projects to create healthier conditions for the 
poor and underserved in this country and 
abroad. 
As a Tamil American, I share a deep sense 
of pride in the accomplishments of fellow 
Tamil Americans. ATMA has raised thousands 
of dollars to underwrite relief efforts for natural 
disasters all over the world. Its charitable en-
deavors support homeless shelters in the 
United States, construction of children’s hos-
pitals in India, and organizations that prevent 
the spread of infectious diseases. Throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic, ATMA provided 
funding and resources for hospitals, and oper-
ated a 24-hour helpline to aid those in need of 
medical assistance. 
ATMA also serves as an important edu-
cational resource through its efforts to mentor 
medical students of Tamil origin, and the Con-
tinuing Medical Education seminars it offers in 
the United States and India. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize and 
commend the American Tamil Medical Asso-
ciation for the contributions its members make 
to improve public health around the world. 
REMEMBERING JAY ROBERT 
SORENSEN 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory and life of Jay 
Robert Sorensen, a U.S. Navy veteran, dedi-
cated public servant, and lifelong outdoors-
man. Jay’s passion for the outdoors was not 
limited to his own fishing, as he took any op-
portunity to share California’s natural wonders 
with those around him. His endless love of the 
water led him to become one of California’s 
most outspoken conservationists, constantly 
working to protect the state’s complex eco-
systems. 
Born on September 28, 1936, Jay grew up 
in Stockton before enlisting in the Navy in 
1954. Upon the conclusion of his service, Jay 
returned to Stockton where he spent the next 
17 years working for the Stockton Unified 
School District. When presented with the op-
portunity to turn his lifelong passion for the 
outdoors into a career, Jay purchased a local 
bait shop where he spent decades helping 
others enjoy the Delta as much as he did. 
Jay’s passion for fishing led to him becom-
ing an outspoken conservationist. He was 
among the earliest leaders to draw attention to 
declining fish populations and the loss of cru-
cial spawning environments in the Delta. In 
order to protect the Delta’s fragile ecosystem, 
Jay helped found the California Striped Bass 
Association and wrote about the need to pro-
tect fish populations in numerous publications. 
I was lucky to work alongside Jay for many 
years in my efforts to protect California’s 
unique natural gems. His passion for the Delta 
was unmatched, and his legacy will live on 
through the continued efforts to preserve its 
wildlife populations. 
He is survived by his two step-daughters 
Sandi Smith and Theresa Forbes. I know that 
they, along with the rest of his extended family 
and friends, join me in celebrating his life and 
his memory.

RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF MO-
NESSEN, 
PENNSYLVANIA 
UPON 
THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
DESIGNATION AS A CITY 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the city of Monessen, Penn-
sylvania, on the 100th anniversary of its des-
ignation as a city. 
The land that would ultimately encompass 
Monessen was surveyed in 1897 by H. Dallas 
McCabe. Along with Colonel James M. 
Schoonmaker and colleagues, McCabe initially 
sought to expand the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie 
railway to reach coalfields further south. Indus-
trialist William H. Donner approached the 
group and decided to bring his American Tin 
Plate Company to Monessen, forever chang-
ing its trajectory. 
The construction of the first mill spurred fur-
ther settlement by businesses and families

from around the world. On September 3, 
1898, the community was officially founded, 
and the name ‘‘Monessen’’ was chosen be-
cause the community would be a ‘‘New World 
Essen 
on 
the 
Monongahela,’’ 
combining 
‘‘Mon’’ 
for 
the 
Monongahela 
River 
and 
‘‘Essen’’ for an industrial city in Germany. 
Perfectly situated with access to the city of 
Pittsburgh, the Mon Valley’s waterways, and 
the immense coal reserves of southwestern 
Pennsylvania, Monessen grew exponentially. 
By the early 20th century, it was an industrial 
hub, hosting the Pittsburgh Steel Works and 
the American Steel Hoop Company, among 
others. 
On September 16, 1921, Monessen was of-
ficially designated a city under the leadership 
of Mayor Carl Woodward. At its peak, Mones-
sen was home to more than 20,000 residents. 
By the mid–20th century, Monessen had be-
come a center of the budding American mid-
dle-class. So much so that it attracted the at-
tention of organized labor leaders and promi-
nent American politicians. President Harry S. 
Truman visited Monessen in 1956. President 
John F. Kennedy travelled there in 1962. 
Madam Speaker, today Monessen is home 
to 7,600 men, women, and children. I am 
proud to represent this uniquely American city, 
and I have no doubt it will continue to make 
its mark on our Nation.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SAC-
RIFICE OF MARINE LANCE COR-
PORAL RYLEE MCCOLLUM 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madame Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and sacrifice of Marine 
Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum. 
Rylee was a beloved son, brother, friend, 
husband, and soon-to-be father who made the 
ultimate sacrifice protecting our freedoms and 
defending our interests while serving in Af-
ghanistan. 
His family remembers him as someone who 
was wholly intolerant of injustice and stood up 
for those who could not stand up for them-
selves. He was a deeply patriotic young man 
who had a passion for learning. Specifically, 
he was interested in the ceremonies that en-
compassed our Nation’s most sacred tradi-
tions. As his father remarked ‘‘He’s the most 
patriotic kid you could find, loved America, 
loved the military. Tough as nails with a heart 
of gold.’’ 
His willingness to put himself in harm’s way 
to keep our country safe and preserve our 
freedom represents a level of selflessness and 
heroism that embodies the best of America. 
Rylee was a native of Bondurant, Wyoming, 
and demonstrated an interest in joining the 
Armed Services from an early age. He at-
tended Jackson Hole High School, where he 
became a decorated wrestler, and later went 
on to graduate from Summit Innovations 
School in Jackson in 2019. It was no surprise 
to his friends and family when right after grad-
uation, on his 18th birthday, he followed 
through on his determination to serve this Na-
tion at the highest level by enlisting in the U.S. 
Marines. 
Rylee McCollum died a hero, and his brav-
ery will never be forgotten. I want to thank him 
for his service to our country and express the 
deepest condolences of the entire Congress to 
his family and loved ones.

HONORING DAVID ROYBAL’S 80TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor David Roybal’s incredible 
contributions to our beloved New Mexico. His 
passion for life, for family, for the land, and for 
members of his community is everything that 
we cherish and stand for in our great state. 
David turns 80 years old today—still working 
the land and still giving back, as he has done 
his entire life. 
David was born and raised in Chupadero, 
New Mexico, and comes from a family that be-
lieved and practiced service and selflessness. 
David’s grandfather- served in the Army, Da-
vid’s father served in World War II, and David 
followed in their footsteps and served in Viet-
nam. David, his father, and his father before 
him all received the Purple Heart. David gath-
ers Purple Heart veterans together still and is 
a leader among these wounded warriors. 
While David served as a firefighter for 25 
years, he worked with his neighbors in the 
acequias. He knows the profound significance 
that these irrigation systems bring to our agri-
culture, culture, economy, and heritage. In 
fact, David became Mayordomo in 1970. He 
worked and managed the lifeblood of our com-
munities for 40 years. He worked because of 
his endless spirit to help others and improve 
the place he called home—never even expect-
ing to be paid for his work. 
David embodies community. With everything 
he does, he promotes love, respect, selfless-
ness, tradition, and kindness. There is no 
more perfect example of this than David’s 
leadership in managing the acequia that 
brings so much value to every single member 
of the beautiful valley they call home. 
Happy Birthday, David. As I often say: agua 
es vida y acequia es comunidad. You are the 
life of our community. But it doesn’t start and 
end with only water. Thank you for your life-
long commitment to breathing so many dif-
ferent kinds of life into our beloved commu-
nities.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MIKE FORSTER 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of former Monroe 
County Commissioner Mike Forster. Commis-
sioner Forster’s unwavering sense of convic-
tion and outstanding public service to his com-
munity earned him respect and admiration 
from those who knew him and anyone he 
crossed paths with. 
Mike Forster was first elected to office in the 
Village of Islamorada where he served for 
twelve years. Before becoming commissioner, 
he served as mayor twice, vice mayor twice, 
and served on the Islamorada Chamber of 
Commerce Board of Directors. 
A man of dignity and integrity, commissioner 
Mike Forster was an exemplary role model for 
many. His grand contributions cannot be 
measured. From Uganda to the Florida Keys, 
he was always attentive to his community and 
gave it his all. He earnestly fought to ensure 
that anyone he met had a quality of life. 
He rose to the challenge. When it was 
needed, he stepped up to the plate. At the be-
ginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, he pro-
vided free meals to servers, bartenders, 
cooks, bussers, and other Florida Keys resi-
dents involved in the hospitality industry out of 
his restaurant. During Hurricane Irma, he led 
efforts to assist those who were ill and help 
their families when the community underwent 
disasters. 
Commissioner Mike Forster will be remem-
bered for his lifelong charitable contributions to 
the Florida Keys and his genuine character. It 
was 
a 
pleasure 
knowing 
Commissioner 
Forster. He will be profoundly missed.

HONORING THE TWENTIETH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
TERRORIST 
ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
on September 11, 2021, our nation com-
memorated the twentieth anniversary of the 
devastating attacks of September 11, 2001. 
On this solemn occasion, I rise to remember 
the lives lost on that dark day and honor the 
sacrifices made in the two decades since. 
America is a nation of patriots that choose 
to face danger head on when others run 
away. When terrorists hijacked four airplanes 
and carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in 
the history of the world, our nation came to-
gether to comfort, encourage, and ultimately 
defend one another. With two planes hitting 
the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 
New York City, the third plane hitting the Pen-
tagon, and the fourth plane crashing in a field 
in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, our first respond-
ers, including our law enforcement, firefighters, 
and other emergency personnel valiantly ran 
towards danger to save lives and prevent fur-
ther destruction. We owe these heroes a great 
debt of gratitude, and without them, countless 
additional lives could have been lost. 
The 9/11 attacks tragically cost the lives of 
almost 3,000 men, women, and children, and 
the following efforts to combat terrorism 
around the world resulted in the loss of over 
7,000 servicemen and women. I am proud of 
the thousands of brave servicemen and 
women who answered the call to duty, and I’m 
especially proud of my constituents who have 
since served to defend the United States and 
protect the innocent around the globe. Without 
their heroism, the world would be a much 
darker place. We will always remember their 
sacrifice and bravery. 
On 
this 
September 
11th, 
communities 
across the United States, including in my 
hometown of Enterprise, Alabama, will gather 
to mourn the lives lost, honor the bravery of 
the American people, and dedicate them-
selves to ensuring that these sacrifices were 
not made in vain,

HONORING THE LIVES OF FRED 
AND YVONNE BARBER 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Korean War Veteran 
and great American, Fred Eugene Barber and 
his wife, Yvonne Barber. Fred passed away 
on Friday, September 10, 2021 at 90 years 
old. Fred’s beloved wife, Yvonne, passed 
away only 13 hours earlier of heart failure at 
88 years old. They are survived by their 2 
daughters, Karen and Jan, in addition to 5 
grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. 
Fred and Yvonne married in June 1953 after 
dating for only 6 months. This year involved 
several exciting milestones for the couple, as 
they celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary 
in June and family and friends gathered to cel-
ebrate Fred’s 90th birthday in August. 
The couple was also extremely active in 
their community and held a deep love for Lake 
Havasu City. Fred and Yvonne were involved 
in the Republican Party, PACE, and their local 
church. Fred taught a Constitution class at 
various schools and other local organizations 
in addition to writing and publishing over 25 
novels about American historical fiction and 
spy fiction. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to express my 
deepest condolences to the family of Fred and 
Yvonne Barber and to honor their memory. 
Fred and Yvonne’s selfless public service and 
local impact will never be forgotten by the 
people of Lake Havasu City, Arizona.

HON. JOE COURTNEY

Friday, September 17, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise

liam ‘‘Bill’’ H. St. Onge after fifty years in the 
legal profession. Bill recently announced his 
retirement from a busy smalltown practice that 
ethically and capably represented thousands 
of individuals and families, sometimes at mo-
ments of crisis. Despite that demanding 
schedule he still found time to elevate the pro-
fession as an active member of the Con-
necticut Bar Association, and completed a dis-
tinguished stint serving his conununity as the 
First Selectmen of Putnam. Throughout his 
years, Bill has been a shining example of pro-
fessionalism, compassion, and service to 
those around him. His retirement is one that is 
well-deserved. 
Bill’s family has a long history of public serv-
ice most notably his father Congressman Wil-
liam St. Onge, who served the Second district 
of eastern Connecticut from 1963 to 1970 with 
great success. That example certainly rubbed 
off on Bill Junior who has been a life-long con-
tributor to the local community in northeastern 
Connecticut and someone who avidly followed 
world and national politics. I have always par-
ticularly enjoyed when Bill would share stories 
about his father as well as his shrewd under-
standing of public affairs. 
Bill was a graduate of Georgetown Univer-
sity and continued his education by attending 
the University of Connecticut Law School. 
Upon obtaining his JD in 1974, Bill went on to 
practice law through to his retirement. As I 
mentioned earlier, that while fresh in the field 
of practice, Bill wasted no time in running for 
and serving as First Selectman of Putnam, 
which he did so very successfully for nearly a 
decade. 
Even after leading his town as First Select-
man, Bill remained a constant in the commu-
nity and utilized his expertise to give back to 
his neighbors. Providing a form of accessible 
representation for fellow towns like Killingly 
and Thompson, Bill ran a highly successful 
small-town practice for probate, municipal, and 
real estate law. As the local lawyer, he sought 
to continuously improve upon the services 
available to those in the area, taking the initia-
tive to serve on the Connecticut Bar Associa-
tion’s Task Force on the Future of Probate 
Court. He was also a staple at town meetings 
and local proceedings, providing legal advice 
and often cooling local issues of passion to 
the respectful, personable tone that they de-
served. His thoughtful nature as a practicing 
lawyer always kept the town discussion pur-
poseful and productive. As someone who 
practiced law for 27 years in nearby Tolland 
County, I did have the opportunity to work with 
Bill on real estate closings and an occasional 
civil matter. He was a true gentleman—very 
pragmatic, down to earth and cordial in all his 
dealings—kind of a modem-day Atticus Finch. 
Madam Speaker, Attorney St. Onge’s pas-
sion for his home was a predominant pres-
ence throughout his life and career. His wife 
and children, Jane, Will and Caroline as well 
as his grandchildren and his many friends in 
Connecticut can attest to his caring, thoughtful 
approach to all he came into contact with. Al-
though his long career is coming to an end, 
his family legacy of passion and work for his 
home will unquestionably go on to reverberate 
throughout the Town of Putnam and beyond 
for years to come. I can only hope that the ex-
ample of his service is carried on and that 
hope he enjoys a fruitful retirement with his 
wife, children and grandchildren. To that end, 
I ask my colleagues in the House to join me 
in honoring and congratulating Attorney St. 
Onge for his dedication to the public and near-
ly 50-year exceptional career.
