HONORING EDDIE MCBRIDE 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, it 
is an honor to congratulate my friend, 
Eddie McBride, on 23 outstanding years 
at the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce. 
Eddie has served as the president and 
CEO of the Lubbock Chamber since 
1999. Under his leadership, the Lubbock 
Chamber 
has 
received 
countless 
awards, including the best chamber in 
the Nation and numerous star accredi-
tations. 
Again, my dear friend is an excep-
tional leader, even though he attended 
Texas A&M University. Then he served 
his Nation in the United States Air 
Force for 20 years. 
Upon moving to Lubbock in 1976, 
Eddie immersed himself into our com-
munity, served on numerous boards, in-
cluding the Texas Association of Busi-
ness, 
Workforce 
Solutions 
South 
Plains, and Covenant Health for dec-
ades. Eddie has served with excellence 
and integrity, always putting our com-
munity’s interests above his own. 
I congratulate Eddie on an out-
standing career, and I thank him from 
the bottom of our hearts for his service 
and contributions to Lubbock and to 
west Texas. 
We wish the very best for you and 
your wife, Debbie; your children, Chel-
sea 
and 
Patrick; 
and 
the 
entire 
McBride family. 
God bless you. And go west Texas. 
RECOGNIZING SERGEANT JERROD BURTNETT 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Sergeant Jerrod 
Burtnett, a true west Texas hero. 
On December 27, 2019, vast fog sur-
rounded Sergeant Burtnett as he inves-
tigated a series of crashes due to zero 
visibility in Lubbock County. After 
checking on a bystander along the side 
of the road, a fast-moving tractor-trail-
er lost control, hitting a number of ve-
hicles, as well as Sergeant Burtnett, 
causing him serious injury. 
Sergeant Burtnett won the Purple 
Heart for his actions that day, and his 
experience is a reminder to us all how 
dangerous the job of being in law en-
forcement is. 
It is an honor to recognize Sergeant 
Burtnett for his bravery and his stead-
fastness to enter a dangerous situation 
to help the people of Texas. 
On that cold, foggy day, Sergeant 
Burtnett exerted the valor, courage, 
and selflessness that epitomized the 
men and women in blue. 
May God bless Sergeant Burtnett and 
his family, and all those in uniform 
who risk their lives to protect ours. 
SANCTUARY CITY FOR THE UNBORN 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve life is a gift from God, begins at 
conception, and that unborn children 
have the same right to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness as you and I 
do. 
Nothing gives me more joy or sense 
of purpose than being a champion for 
the unborn. I know the vast majority 
of west Texans believe, as I do, that all 
life is sacred, God-given, and should be 
protected at all stages. 
The Lubbock community recently 
stood together against the stain of 
abortion on the fabric of our country 
by voting to become a sanctuary city 
for the unborn. Now, whether or not 
this ordinance is upheld in the courts, 
I am immensely proud that my home-
town has made a statement, not only 
to Texas, but to the whole country, 
that as for us, the people of west Texas, 
we stand for life. 
Mr. Speaker, west Texans firmly be-
lieve, as I do, that we ought to promote 
a culture of life and that life at every 
stage is equally valuable, equally pre-
cious, not only in light of the Constitu-
tion, but in the eyes of God. 
Like the citizens of Lubbock, I will 
continue to fight for the voiceless, vul-
nerable, unborn Americans and their 
constitutionally protected right to life. 
God bless America. God bless the un-
born. And go west Texas. 
f 
OUR BORDERLESS COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
YARMUTH). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, last 
year, we had achieved operational con-
trol of our southern border for the first 
time in generations. Trespassers knew 
they would be turned back, so they 
never started the perilous journey. 
On his first day in office, Joe Biden 
canceled the border wall, ordered ICE 
not to faithfully execute the laws, and 
canceled the remain-in-Mexico policy 
for asylum claims. This sent a powerful 
message throughout the world that 
America’s borders are wide open. So 
now we are 4 months into an experi-
ment that will test how long a country 
without borders can survive. 
The numbers speak for themselves. 
The week of the 2020 election, scarcely 
100 family units illegally crossed our 
border. By the week of the inaugura-
tion, 1,100 did. By the last week of 
March, it was over 14,000 in a week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2426 
May 18, 2021 
In February, the Border Patrol en-
countered roughly 100,000 aliens ille-
gally crossing our border. That is 
about the size of South Bend, Indiana. 
By March, that number had grown to 
over 170,000. That is about the size of 
Salem, Oregon. Last month, the num-
ber reached nearly 180,000, the popu-
lation of Providence, Rhode Island, a 
900 percent increase over April of last 
year. 
Thirty-eight percent are being re-
leased into our country. In April, ICE 
deportations fell to their lowest num-
ber in history. Felons that the law re-
quires to be deported are instead delib-
erately being released into our neigh-
borhoods. 
In the last 2 months, I joined delega-
tions led by Congressmen JORDAN and 
BIGGS across the southern border. In 
the Rio Grande Valley sector, we 
watched one night as hundreds of 
aliens from Central America illegally 
crossed our border with impunity and 
entered 
a 
Disneyland-style 
queue. 
After a brief interview, groups in the 
company 
of 
small 
children 
were 
dropped off at transportation hubs to 
be taken anywhere in the United 
States they wanted to go without even 
being given a notice to appear in court. 
Unaccompanied minors were taken to 
a holding facility where they were 
placed in cattle pens. One unit designed 
for 33 people had over 500 in it. After a 
few days, they were transferred to HHS 
facilities. 
No effort is made to safely return 
them to their homes. Every effort is 
made to place them in the United 
States, often with family or friends 
who are themselves here illegally. 
The President just transferred $2 bil-
lion to accommodate this flood that he 
has created, taken from funds Congress 
appropriated to rebuild our emergency 
medical reserve and fund COVID test-
ing. Simply stated, Americans last. 
In the San Diego, El Centro, and 
Yuma sectors, we saw the nearly com-
pleted border wall built by the Trump 
administration made useless because of 
small construction gaps that can’t be 
filled because Mr. Biden has forbidden 
it. Aliens just calmly walk through 
them. 
We saw one group taken into custody 
from Romania. Another group of about 
20 were from Cuba, Russia, and Arme-
nia. From all over the world, people are 
flying into Mexico on tourist visas, 
making their way to border towns, and 
then walking through the gaps to enter 
the United States illegally. 
In California, one officer told us their 
orders were to process as many illegals 
into the country as fast as possible. 
From its polling, Gallup estimates 
there are 42 million people now living 
in Latin America and the Caribbean 
alone who intend to come to the United 
States if they can. And now they are. 
We are witnessing the beginning of a 
mass migration of historic proportions, 
one that no civilization in human his-
tory has ever survived. One Border Pa-
trol officer warned us that every com-
munity in America is about to become 
a border town. Every American will 
feel it as classrooms are filled with 
non-English 
speaking 
students; 
as 
gangs proliferate; as criminal illegal 
aliens are released in our communities; 
as 
hospital 
emergency 
rooms 
are 
packed with illegals demanding basic 
medical care; and as a desperate labor 
market is flooded with low-wage illegal 
labor, meaning lower wages and fewer 
opportunities for working Americans. 
This is not accidental. This adminis-
tration is pursuing a deliberate policy 
to fundamentally change the culture, 
electorate, and founding principles of 
our Nation. It is working, and it will 
continue as long as the people respon-
sible for it remain in public office. 
History is littered with the ruins of 
nations that fail to control their bor-
ders. Whether ours soon joins them de-
pends on Americans taking back their 
government before it is too late.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF DR. 
SAMUEL MAGEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today with great sad-
ness to remember the life of my friend, 
Dr. Sam Magee, who unexpectedly 
passed away this past weekend. 
An exemplary surgeon, Dr. Magee 
dedicated his life to serving his pa-
tients and our Blair County commu-
nity. 
Sam, as the son of an Altoona sur-
geon, proudly carried forth his family 
tradition. Most recently, Dr. Magee 
cared for American veterans as the 
chief of staff of the James E. Van 
Zandt VA Medical Center. In this new 
role, Dr. Magee was an instrumental 
partner in the launch of my Home-
grown Health Care initiative, which 
aims to reverse the doctor shortage in 
rural communities. 
Dr. Sam Magee was a champion for 
solutions to tough problems. Together, 
we shared a mission to improve Penn-
sylvanians’ 
access 
to 
quality 
healthcare, regardless of ZIP Code. 
In addition to his work at the VA, 
Dr. Magee spent more than 35 years 
practicing in Altoona, Pennsylvania, 
saving lives and improving our local 
healthcare. My family and I personally 
came to experience his great skills. 
As both a fellow Altoona native, and 
Penn State and Temple Medical School 
graduates, Dr. Magee and I shared so 
much in common. More than a col-
league, I considered him a very dear 
friend. 
As we remember his life and his leg-
acy, I also give thanks for his meaning-
ful contributions to his patients, to our 
community, and to our medical profes-
sion. Even in sorrow, we celebrate Dr. 
Magee’s life and his indelible contribu-
tions to the world. 
I extend my deepest sympathy to his 
wife, Bunny; their children, Rich and 
Katie, 
along 
with 
their 
spouses, 
Desiree and Michael; their beloved 
grandchildren; and their extended fam-
ily. 
Additionally, I extend my condo-
lences to Dr. Magee’s many patients 
and to the veteran community that he 
served with such dedication. This is a 
profound loss for our medical commu-
nity, our veteran community, and our 
community at large. 
f 
HONORING THE INCREDIBLE LIFE 
OF ARNOLD E. PERL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in the memory of my friend and a 
great Memphian, Arnold Perl. 
Arnold was known as a devoted hus-
band, father, grandfather, friend, and 
strong advocate. While Arnold Perl was 
born in Texas and raised in Chicago, 
Memphis was Arnold’s true home. He 
earned his undergraduate and law de-
grees from the University of Illinois 
and, in 1968, moved to Tennessee. Mem-
phis remained his adopted city until 
his passing on May 4 of this year. 
After he came to Memphis, Arnold 
founded his own law firm, Young & 
Perl, a law firm focusing on labor law 
and labor-management relations. Ar-
nold later served as a member of the 
well-known 
Memphis 
law 
firm 
Glankler Brown, where he represented 
some of the biggest Fortune 500 compa-
nies. 
b 1015 
Arnold also argued cases before nu-
merous State and Federal courts, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals, and the United 
States Supreme Court. 
As a lawyer, Arnold was sought after 
for his impressive skills, his expertise, 
and his extensive knowledge of the rule 
of law. Since 1983, he was listed in each 
edition of The Best Lawyers in Amer-
ica and even served on its advisory 
board. 
Without a doubt, Arnold was an ex-
tremely accomplished lawyer, but his 
passions went beyond the law. 
For over 30 years, Arnold served as a 
strong and committed member of the 
Memphis-Shelby County Airport Au-
thority. For 16 of those years, from 
1996–2012, he was its chairman. 
Through 
his 
leadership, 
Arnold 
played a vital role in making the Mem-
phis International Airport into one of 
the top hubs in the world. Working in 
conjunction with FedEx, Arnold helped 
the 
Memphis 
airport 
become 
the 
world’s largest cargo airport. 
He also facilitated the relocation of 
the Tennessee Air National Guard’s 
headquarters, which helped promote 
growth for Memphis. 
Arnold was chairman of the New 
Arena 
Public 
Building 
Authority, 
where he oversaw the development of 
the FedExForum, the home of the 
Memphis Grizzlies and the Memphis Ti-
gers.

May 18, 2021 
This was a huge accomplishment for 
Memphis, as it brought great economic 
development and unity to the commu-
nity. 
During its construction, Arnold’s 
mantra was to build the facility on 
time 
and 
on 
budget. 
Indeed, 
the 
FedExForum was built in 3 years and 
on budget. 
Most importantly, Arnold was a dedi-
cated member of the Memphis Jewish 
community and was devoted to his 
faith. He served as the 45th president of 
Temple Israel in Memphis, from 2006– 
2009. 
Arnold was passionate in his advo-
cacy for Israel. In 1983, he and his wife, 
Mary Lynn, were two of the founding 
members of the AIPAC chapter in 
Memphis. Arnold was devoted to edu-
cating people on the importance of a 
strong U.S.-Israel relationship. 
Ultimately, Arnold was not only a 
gifted lawyer; he was a true civic giant, 
a fierce advocate, a faithful individual, 
and a loving family man. He worked 
tirelessly to make Memphis a better 
place for all to live. 
His two daughters, Stephanie and 
Laurie; and his two sons-in-law, Jeff 
and Jonathan, who he saw more as 
sons, said that their dad followed four 
pillars that he adopted from one of his 
mentors: 
Family, 
faith, 
profes-
sionalism, and community. 
Roberta and I extend our deepest 
sympathies to Mary Lynn, his loving 
wife of 55 years; their daughters, 
Stephanie and Laurie; his sons-in-law, 
Jeff and Jonathan; his six grand-
children, and the rest of his family and 
friends. 
May his memory be a blessing. 
f 
HONORING MARY ALICE WORKMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor my 
wife’s grandmother, Mary Alice Work-
man, who, sadly, passed away in late 
January at the age of 98. 
Mary Alice was born in Decatur. She 
married her husband, Richard, in 1941. 
She was a member of the First United 
Methodist Church in Assumption, Illi-
nois. 
Mary Alice will be remembered for 
her kindheartedness, for the love of her 
large family, and for living life to the 
fullest. 
Mary Alice is now resting peacefully 
with her husband, Richard; and her fa-
vorite dog, Leo. 
It is a sad loss for our family and ev-
eryone who had the pleasure of getting 
to know her. It is always difficult say-
ing good-bye to someone we love and 
appreciate, 
especially 
when 
you 
couldn’t see them in person before they 
passed. 
Shannon, Toryn, Griffin, Clark, and I 
send our thoughts and prayers to her 
children, 
Kenneth, 
Kathleen, 
and 
Nancy; and their families; and her 
other 
grandchildren, 
Randy, 
Kelly, 
Curt, Ric; and the rest of her great- 
grandchildren, 
Trenee, 
Ryan, 
Ross, 
Connor, Sydney, Grace, and Payton. 
Mary Alice, may you rest in peace. 
HONORING TREVOR HERDERHORST 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Trevor 
Herderhorst of Highland, Illinois, who 
died on April 25 after a courageous 
fight with cancer. 
Trevor began his dream of becoming 
a firefighter in 2005 with the Cahokia 
Volunteer Fire Department. Later, he 
graduated from SIUC with a degree in 
fire service management, and went on 
to serve as a Granite City firefighter. 
In 2018, Trevor started his dream job 
with the City of Champaign Fire De-
partment in its Operations Division. 
Trevor loved being a firefighter and 
was a proud professional, always striv-
ing to hone his skills to save lives. 
Those who knew Trevor will remem-
ber him for his inspirational positivity 
and his passion for making the world 
around him a better place and his love 
for baseball. 
My prayers are with Trevor’s wife, 
Tiffany; his children, Chase and Olivia; 
and all his friends and family spread 
throughout the communities he made 
better with his presence. He will truly 
be missed. 
RECOGNIZING KNIGHT’S ACTION PARK 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Knight’s Action Park in Springfield, Il-
linois, which is celebrating 91 years of 
business this year. 
It was founded in 1930 as a golf driv-
ing range by George Knight, Sr., after 
he spent a few years touring the coun-
try as the caddy for four-time U.S. 
Open champion Willie Anderson. 
George Knight, Jr., and his wife, Au-
drey, started an archery range in 1951, 
and later opened the family entertain-
ment center. Knight’s Action Park 
spans 60 acres and three generations of 
the Knight family. Over the years, it 
has added a water park, pub, and drive- 
in theater. 
Like many businesses that rely on 
large attendance, they faced challenges 
amidst the coronavirus pandemic. They 
credit the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram for allowing them to survive 2020, 
so they can continue to provide jobs for 
200 seasonal workers, 10 permanent 
staff, and family fun for me, my fam-
ily, and my constituents. Hopefully, 
they will be able to fully reopen soon. 
Again, 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Knights on their 91st anniversary, and 
I wish them all the best in the years to 
come. 
RECOGNIZING DR. LARRY DIETZ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
friend, Dr. Larry Dietz, the 19th presi-
dent of Illinois State University, who 
will retire on June 30 after a remark-
able 50-year academic career. 
Dr. Dietz began his career at ISU in 
2011 as the Vice President for Student 
Affairs. In 2014, he was appointed Illi-
nois State’s 19th president. Prior to 
coming to ISU, he served as Vice Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs at Southern 
Illinois University Carbondale, and he 
held various other leadership positions 
at the University of Missouri and Iowa 
State University. 
President Dietz’s passion for higher 
education has taken an already highly 
esteemed ISU to new heights. With his 
leadership, the university is contin-
ually ranked among the top in the Na-
tion for high graduation and retention 
rates and low student loan default 
rates. He leaves ISU on a footing that 
is full of potential. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with Larry since he became president. 
A personal testament I have to his suc-
cess is the fact that all three of my 
children attend Illinois State Univer-
sity, the institution he leads. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Mr. President. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO FRANK 
FRYBURG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and to pay tribute to a 
community leader, a veteran, and a 
vocal advocate, Mr. Frank Fryburg, 
who passed away last week at the age 
of 94. 
Those of us who had the pleasure to 
know Frank know that he lived a life 
of service to others. Frank joined the 
Navy in 1944 as an electronic techni-
cian, and went on to serve 20 years in 
the Navy Reserves. Frank was a grad-
uate of Penn State University, earning 
his bachelor’s degree in physics on the 
GI Bill. He later earned his MBA from 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Whar-
ton School. 
Frank served his community for a 
decade as a commissioner in Manheim 
Township in Lancaster County. He was 
an active member of his church, a na-
tional leader of his chosen fraternity, 
and worked to support countless com-
munity organizations over the years. 
With Frank, you always knew where 
you stood. He always shared his opin-
ions with you, and they were very well- 
thought out. He was recently recog-
nized as one of the most prolific letter 
writers to the editor in the local news-
paper. 
Frank Fryburg was a man of excep-
tional character, of boundless energy 
and determination, a true servant lead-
er, and a community advocate. 
Frank is survived by his 6 children, 
13 grandchildren, and 20 great-grand-
children. 
We will miss him. We wish those who 
are grieving, comfort. We give thanks 
for the opportunity to know Frank, 
who positively impacted so many peo-
ple during his 94 years. 
THANKING ALEX MUNRO

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2428 
May 18, 2021 
to come in Pennsylvania’s 11th Con-
gressional District. 
Alex Munro has retired after 30 years 
as executive director of the Thaddeus 
Stevens College of Technology Founda-
tion and Alumni Association. Thaddeus 
Stevens 
College 
of 
Technology 
is 
known across the State and across the 
Nation as a preeminent 2-year degree- 
granting institution, which prepares 
students for today’s in-demand tech-
nical jobs. 
Prior to serving the college, Alex 
graduated from the school then known 
as the Thaddeus Stevens Trade School, 
and he talked many times about how it 
changed his life. He studied masonry at 
the school. After 25 years in the private 
sector, 
successfully 
applying 
those 
skills and the lessons that he learned 
at Thaddeus Stevens, Alex joined the 
alumni foundation board before becom-
ing the foundation’s executive director 
in 1990. 
Alex has been integral to the ad-
vancement of the school, building rela-
tionships with elected officials and in-
dustry leaders to support expansion of 
the school’s mission and programs. 
Alex is known for saying: ‘‘Changing 
lives is not by chance; it is a tradition 
at Stevens.’’ 
That is a tradition that he has dedi-
cated himself to for the past 30 years. 
I personally have worked with Alex 
for a number of years, and I have al-
ways appreciated his efforts and can-
dor. I want to thank Alex for all he has 
done to improve the lives of so many 
students, and I congratulate him on his 
retirement.

BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, for months 
now, our country has witnessed the 
never-ending horrific images and sto-
ries coming from our southern border. 
We have seen young children thrown 
over a 14-foot fence like a rag doll. We 
have seen children wandering alone, 
abandoned in south Texas. We have 
seen thousands of children packed like 
sardines into holding facilities meant 
for 250. And we have seen countless 
horrific tales of young women sexually 
assaulted by coyotes on their trek up 
here. 
When I traveled to the southern bor-
der in March and again in May, I saw 
the Biden border crisis firsthand. I 
spoke to Border Patrol agents who said 
they are beyond spread thin trying to 
juggle securing the border with an in-
adequate number of agents, while si-
multaneously babysitting the unprece-
dented number of migrant children who 
continue to flood across our southern 
border daily. While they are busy baby-
sitting, violent criminal aliens are slip-
ping through undetected. 
These stories are indisputable. They 
are entirely based in fact and truth. 
But rather than recognize and address 
the reality of the situation, Democrats 
and 
the 
Biden 
administration 
are 
downplaying, distracting, and denying. 
They are downplaying the severity of 
this crisis by refusing to call it a crisis; 
saying, instead, it is a challenge. They 
are denying the crisis by refusing to 
visit the southern border in person. 
It has been 55 days since President 
Biden tapped KAMALA HARRIS to be the 
lead on the border, and she still has not 
visited. And they are distracting from 
this crisis by talking about anything 
but the border. 
Love him or hate him, under Presi-
dent Trump, we finally had a leader 
willing to step up and fix the mess at 
our southern border, a mess our coun-
try has failed to deal with for decades, 
under both Republican and Democrat 
leadership. President Trump was the 
only President who truly took the nec-
essary steps to not only stop the flow 
of illegal aliens across our borders, but 
to deter caravans from ever forming. 
He instituted commonsense policies, 
like the remain in Mexico policy, end-
ing catch and release, and building a 
big, beautiful wall with beautiful gates 
because, as we all know, this isn’t 
about legal immigration; it is about il-
legal immigration. 
b 1030 
We are a nation of laws and law and 
order, or at least we used to be. Ever 
since President Biden assumed control 
of the White House, there has been an 
outright refusal from his administra-
tion to put the American people first 
and address the growing crisis at our 
southern border. Their inaction will 
cost American lives, will cost billions 
of American taxpayer dollars, and will 
once again put the responsibility of the 
Federal 
Government 
on 
individual 
States. 
And I know. I saw it firsthand as a 
county sheriff for 8 years in Texas. I 
had to look victims of crime in the 
eyes after their loved one was killed or 
their homes were burglarized and tell 
these individuals: I am sorry for what 
happened to you, but we caught the 
guy. And I am sad to tell you that he 
has been deported four, five, six times. 
I had to tell this specifically to doz-
ens of residents in my home county 
whose homes were burglarized by a 
burglary ring of illegal aliens from, 
yes, Honduras and Colombia, many of 
whom had been deported several times. 
In January 2020, I had to tell the son 
of an elderly Texas woman who was 
killed in a hit-and-run that the illegal 
alien who ran his mother over had been 
deported six times prior. How on Earth 
does anyone ever get deported more 
than one time from our country? It 
happens because the Federal Govern-
ment is failing to secure the southern 
border. 
It is mind-boggling to me that the 
Democrat Party has accepted that 
American lives will be lost and billions 
of taxpayer dollars wasted so illegal 
aliens can flood into our country sim-
ply because their home country is cor-
rupt or crippled. Economic hardship or 
struggle in your home country is not 
justification for breaking the law and 
skipping the line of millions of people 
patiently waiting to legally immigrate 
here. 
We are not the world’s charity. We 
are not a nation of open borders. We 
are a nation of laws, and it is past time 
the current administration wakes the 
hell up and remembers that fact. But I 
won’t hold my breath, and neither 
should the American people. Demo-
crats have demonstrated right to our 
faces that they don’t care about put-
ting the American people first. 
Members of Congress and the Amer-
ican people need to speak up and speak 
out about the Biden border crisis and 
hold this administration’s feet to the 
fire until they reverse course. 
f 
WE NEED FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to advocate for fiscal responsi-
bility as Congress seeks to craft a 
budget. 
This past year, our Nation has spent 
more than $7.6 trillion. That is more 
than the Federal Government spent in 
the first 200 years since our founding. 
With the Federal Government’s debt 
already clocking in at $28 trillion and 
rising as I speak, we must face the re-
ality that our grandchildren are going 
to foot this bill. 
On May 12, the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics announced that inflation had 
grown by 4.2 percent over the last year. 
That is the largest 12-month increase 
since September 2008. Should we con-
tinue to spend at the rate that we are 
spending, our national debt, debt serv-
icing, and costs for household items 
will continue to skyrocket, making life 
unaffordable for millions more. 
This is not right. It is immoral for us 
to continue to fulfill the wants and 
needs of our generation by stealing op-
portunity from the next. We must do 
the hard work of meeting our country’s 
needs responsibly. 
The Republican Study Committee 
has proposed such a budget, a conserv-
ative budget, one that provides a road-
map toward a better future for our 
country. This budget gets us back on 
track in just 5 years while eliminating 
the deficit and cutting taxes. This is a 
conservative budget, one that aims to 
strengthen our Nation and provide bet-
ter governance. 
I am pleased to report that the RSC 
budget includes four of my legislative 
proposals, including my bill to require 
the Congressional Budget Office to in-
clude the cost of debt servicing when 
preparing cost estimates for proposed 
legislation. Before legislation passes 
either the House or Senate, lawmakers 
should know how much it is going to 
cost, yet Congress routinely ignores 
the true cost and overstates the bene-
fits of new spending. 
The American people have to account 
for the cost of debt servicing in their

family budgets, and providing Congress 
with accurate cost estimates that in-
clude the cost of debt servicing is com-
monsense reform that would hold Con-
gress to the same standard, forcing 
lawmakers to reckon with the actual 
cost of raising our national debt. 
Additionally, this budget is pro-life. 
It includes my bill, the Women’s Public 
Health and Safety Act, which would 
help prevent taxpayer dollars from 
funding abortion providers. This legis-
lation will empower States to end the 
bankrolling of abortion providers and 
free up funding for healthcare initia-
tives for those providers that actually 
put the well-being of women and babies 
first. 
This budget is pro-Second Amend-
ment. It includes my legislation to pro-
hibit a natural disaster declaration 
from being used to impose gun or 
ammo controls. 
Finally, this bill is fiscally respon-
sible. It includes my legislation for a 
Federal sunset commission to monitor 
the effectiveness of government agen-
cies and prevent wasteful inefficiencies 
and duplicative programming. 
I want to thank the RSC Budget 
Task Force chairman, Congressman 
HERN, and the chairman of the RSC, 
Congressman BANKS, for putting forth 
a bold budget. 
We can get our Nation back on track. 
We just need to put in the time to do 
what we have to do here in Wash-
ington.

WHAT CONSTITUTES AN 
INSURRECTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the commis-
sion to study the events of January 6, 
as well as spending $2 billion in a secu-
rity supplemental. 
The question that comes to mind is 
this: What about all the riots that hap-
pened during the summer of 2020 after 
the death of George Floyd? What about 
all the damage caused to Federal build-
ings, churches, people’s businesses, and 
innocent people that were killed, like 
David Dorn? 
This past summer, Minneapolis city 
officials estimate 700 buildings were 
damaged, burned, or destroyed, includ-
ing 360 local businesses. Riots caused 
an estimated $55 million in damages in 
Minneapolis alone. 
BLM and antifa established an auton-
omous zone in Seattle and attempted 
to burn government buildings in Port-
land. Is that not an insurrection? 
On one Friday night alone in New 
York City, BLM protesters caused over 
$100,000 in damages, and 150 people were 
arrested. 
Just one Monday night in Philadel-
phia resulted in a crowd of 1,000 people 
looting stores, setting fires in the mid-
dle of the street, and 30 police officers 
injured. 
Protests in Kansas City resulted in 
$2.1 million in damages, mostly over 
the course of one weekend. Several of-
ficers were injured as well. 
Protests in Wichita, Kansas, cost the 
police department about $1.5 million in 
overtime. 
Protests in Salt Lake City cost at 
least $100,000 in damages. 
Protests in Denver cost the city at 
least $5.5 million in damages and over-
time. 
BLM protesters in Nashville set a 
Federal courthouse on fire. The de-
struction is estimated to have cost $1.2 
million in damages. Again, is that an 
insurrection? 
Protesters in Portland destroyed bar-
riers and attempted to burn down gov-
ernment buildings, resulting in $2.3 
million in damages, including $1.6 mil-
lion in damages to the courthouse 
downtown. 
In St. Louis, following a night of vio-
lence, buildings were looted, vandal-
ized, and burned. 
Protestors 
in 
Louisville 
set 
the 
courthouse on fire and shot two cops, 
resulting in a state of emergency order 
being declared. 
Protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in-
jured police officers, set off fireworks 
near the police and courthouse, and set 
at least two city trucks on fire. 
In Guilford County, North Carolina, a 
courthouse was broken into and set on 
fire, resulting in roughly $200,000 in 
damages. 
Protests in Oakland, California, re-
sulted in a courthouse being set on fire 
and vandalized. 
The LAPD was defunded by $150 mil-
lion, and some smaller crime units 
were eliminated entirely. 
Studies show 570 protests in 220 U.S. 
locations turned violent over the sum-
mer. Are those not insurrections? 
The $1-plus billion in riot damages is 
estimated to be the most expensive in 
insurance history. It resulted in up to 
$2 billion of damages in 20 cities across 
the U.S., mostly concentrated in L.A., 
Detroit, Miami, D.C., and New York. 
Indeed, we should have a commission 
to study the violent BLM and antifa 
mobs that have plagued American cit-
ies this past summer, and that is for 
the American people who, by the way, 
pay the taxes that fund everything we 
do here. 
Also, we should have a security sup-
plemental to fund all the police depart-
ments that have been defunded due to 
the pressure from radical, violent, and 
socialist groups. We should back the 
blue because they certainly back us. 
Also, while it is catch-and-release for 
domestic terrorists, antifa, BLM, the 
people who breached the Capitol on 
January 6 are being abused, some even 
being held for 23 hours a day in solitary 
confinement. 
So, Mr. Speaker, my questions are 
these: Who placed the pipe bombs at 
the RNC and the DNC, which is an at-
tack on both Republicans and Demo-
crats? Why was President Trump’s re-
quest on January 5 for 10,000 National 
Guard denied, and who denied it, and 
what chain of command did they fol-
low? Also, who killed Ashli Babbitt, 
and why is that not being revealed? 
Does her family not deserve justice? 
Lastly, when will the witch hunt of 
Donald J. Trump come to an end, and 
all of those who support him? 
f 
UNREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, what 
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad are doing to Israel is nothing 
short of evil and barbaric. Even worse, 
some of my colleagues across the aisle 
and in the national media are excusing 
this violence against our closest ally in 
the Middle East. 
It is a fact that Hamas and the PIJ, 
if they were to lay down their weapons, 
there would be peace. But if the 
Israelis laid down theirs, they would be 
exterminated. This is no secret because 
these two terrorist groups explicitly 
say their goal is to wipe Israel off the 
face of the map, and their actions back 
up their words, Mr. Speaker. 
I think a history lesson and global 
current affairs update is in order for 
Members of Congress and media orga-
nizations taking the side of terrorists 
intent on exterminating Israel and the 
entire Jewish population. 
For starters, nobody should forget 
that, in 1997, it was President Bill Clin-
ton’s State Department that placed 
Hamas and the PIJ on the United 
States’ list of foreign terrorist organi-
zations. Both groups are still on the 
list today and for good reason. 
Israel removed their forces from the 
Gaza Strip in 2005, but in 2007, Hamas 
violently forced out Fatah, its rival 
Palestinian faction, and consolidated 
its control over the entire Gaza Strip. 
A terrorist organization controlling 
territory within mere miles of Jewish 
communities leaves Israeli civilians 
vulnerable to violent attacks, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Israel’s military blockade protects 
its rightful homeland from infiltration 
by radical jihadi terrorists. The block-
ade is important for preventing the 
transfer of weapons from Iran’s Revolu-
tionary Guard, which gives support to 
Hamas and PIJ. God only knows the 
devastation 
recent 
missile 
attacks 
would have inflicted if the Iranians 
were able to smuggle guided missiles 
into the Gaza Strip. 
Despite the blockade, Hamas and PIJ 
still construct their terror tunnels and 
manufacture their rockets with dual- 
use materials like concrete, steel, 
chemicals, fuel, explosives, and many 
other things. These materials, which 
the Israelis allow to pass through their 
blockade, are meant for infrastructure 
in Gaza, only to wind up confiscated by 
the terrorists for their horrific attacks, 
Mr. Speaker. 
If anybody questions the existence of 
the tunnels or their use, I recommend 
they go on the next codel to Israel to

see for themselves. I have been there 
and stood in them. They are, in fact, 
100 percent real. 
This is a dilemma for Israel. They 
want to improve civilian life in Gaza 
by letting these important materials 
pass through its blockade, but they 
also know their enemies will steal 
these materials and try to harm 
Israelis. 
The violence that began last week 
came as a result of protests regarding 
an ongoing Israeli court order to evict 
Palestinian families from the Sheikh 
Jarrah 
neighborhood 
of 
Jerusalem. 
Palestinian 
Authority 
President 
Mahmoud Abbas, who is serving his 
16th year of what is supposed to be a 4- 
year term, Mr. Speaker, called for un-
rest in the streets. Not to be outdone, 
Hamas and the PIJ recognized a polit-
ical opportunity to assume the mantel 
as protectors of all Palestinian people. 
b 1045 
These terrorist groups responded by 
gutlessly and indiscriminately firing 
over 3,000 missiles since last Monday at 
hospitals, schools, and other civilian 
population centers across central and 
southern Israel. 
Thankfully, the United States pro-
vides Israel with generous military as-
sistance for the Iron Dome and other 
missile defenses. This system has inter-
cepted 90 percent of the missiles. How-
ever, there have been 10 Israelis killed, 
including two children. 
Israel has the right to defend itself 
from 
unprovoked 
terrorist 
attacks 
from Hamas, PIJ, and anybody else. 
The Israelis responded forcefully, ac-
tively trying to limit civilian casual-
ties by calling residents in targeted 
buildings and deploying ‘‘knock on the 
roof’’ warnings. This is a courtesy that 
terror groups like Hamas and PIJ do 
not and will never return. 
Without these important measures, 
Mr. Speaker, hundreds more Pales-
tinian civilians would be dead because 
Hamas and PIJ use commercial and 
residential buildings to house their 
military operations and ammunition 
depots. This disgusting tactic is the 
reason why the Palestinian death toll 
is higher and why the lives of dozens of 
innocent 
Palestinian 
children 
have 
been lost. 
These terror groups are more than 
willing to use their own people as 
human shields for the sake of vilifying 
Israel. Unfortunately, the most radical 
Members of Congress and the American 
mainstream media have bought this 
narrative hook, line, and sinker, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Hamas and the PIJ are no friends of 
ours and want the same fate for Israel 
that so many terrorists want for the 
United States: the complete and total 
destruction of democracy. 
If you are going to blame Israel alone 
for the recent violence, you are being 
nothing more than a useful idiot and a 
publicity tool for the two terrorist or-
ganizations. 
RECOGNIZING TERI TOPPING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
have the privilege of recognizing one of 
the millions of hardworking, taxpaying 
Americans who form the foundation of 
our Nation’s economy through their 
employment in small business—in this 
particular case, the healthcare indus-
try. 
Mrs. Teri Topping of Elkins, West 
Virginia, has served her patients excep-
tionally well throughout her distin-
guished career as an orthopedic nurse 
manager. 
As a result, Mrs. Topping is beloved 
by her community for the conscien-
tious care that she has provided to 
those in need. Her outstanding per-
formance has helped her local hospital, 
the Davis Memorial Hospital in Elkins, 
West Virginia, become one of the best 
hospitals for joint care in the entire 
Mountain State. 
It is hardly surprising that Mrs. Top-
ping’s patients illustrated their deep 
appreciation for her incredible efforts 
when the Inter-Mountain’s 2021 Peo-
ple’s Choice Awards opened balloting 
to the public. In a heartwarming dis-
play, those graced by Mrs. Topping’s 
skill and dedication voted in droves to 
grant her this year’s award for Best 
Nurse. This tremendous honor is well 
deserved. 
I extend my thanks and congratula-
tions to Nurse Topping for her phe-
nomenal service to the people of West 
Virginia. I encourage everyone, espe-
cially young nurses, to follow her ex-
traordinary example. 
Teri Topping and her husband, Ret 
Topping, are the mother and father of 
three beautiful daughters. They also 
are grandparents. They have their first 
grandchild, fortunately, living nearby 
them in West Virginia. I consider them 
personal friends, and they are pillars of 
the community. 
Congratulations to Nurse Teri Top-
ping for her Nurse of the Year award. 
f 
HELP FOR VETERANS FACING 
STRUGGLES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, for 
eight generations, my family has lived 
in the mountains of western North 
Carolina. Many of my family members 
have served in our Armed Forces. I 
grew up surrounded by men of courage 
and patriotism who dedicated their 
lives and their honor in defense of this 
American Republic. 
I understand, as much as one can 
without serving, the struggle a veteran 
faces attempting to reacclimate to ci-
vilian life. It is incumbent on the 
American people to work hand in hand 
with our veterans and streamline their 
transition back into the workforce. 
To that end, I urge support for H.R. 
2167, the GI Bill National Emergency 
Extended Deadline Act. Included in 
this larger piece of legislation is a pro-
gram that I am proud to advocate for. 
My language in this bill authorizes a 
pilot program to allow States to use 
grants or contracts to carry out short- 
term fellowship programs for unem-
ployed veterans. This program is not 
some revolutionary concept, but what 
it does is build off the successes of 
other pilot programs in the veteran 
community. 
This program would authorize DOL 
VETS to carry out a pilot program 
similar to fellowship programs created 
by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
Foundation to allow States to use 
grants or contracts to carry out a 
short-term fellowship program. 
After the participating States have 
been selected by the DOL, each State 
would enter into an agreement with a 
nonprofit organization to carry out the 
short-term fellowship program. Par-
ticipants would be provided a small sti-
pend while they are participating in 
the program. 
This program prioritizes veterans 
and opens up new and unique pathways 
toward employment. This new fellow-
ship program will build upon the suc-
cesses of other fellowship programs 
across the country, and I am confident 
that it will empower unemployed vet-
erans to find meaningful work in the 
post-COVID economy. 
The benefits of this program are nu-
merous. It will give eligible veterans 
the ability to gain on-the-job experi-
ence in a field of their interest while 
earning a monthly stipend. 
I will always fight for the veteran 
community in NC–11, and this program 
is a bipartisan measure that puts vet-
erans first. 
One of the foundational attributes of 
Americanism is our sense of brother-
hood. Those who sacrifice for the good 
of this Nation are not simply a re-
source to be utilized and then cast 
aside. These are our heroes, and they 
deserve much more than what our Na-
tion currently provides them. 
When I left my mountain home to 
come to Washington, I promised the 
veterans in our district that I would be 
their weapon in Washington, D.C. I will 
never abandon those who sacrificed 
their lives and livelihoods in defense of 
our freedoms. 
For too long, we have cast our vet-
erans, these guardians of our Republic, 
by the wayside and derided their sac-
rifice. Never forget, America is the 
land of the free because of the brave. 
Together, we can show these men and 
women who dedicated their lives to us 
that we will not turn our backs on 
them. 
Join me in supporting the new vet-
erans fellowship program, and let’s 
take a firm step toward supporting our 
veterans. I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote in favor of H.R. 2167, the National 
Emergency Extended Deadline Act.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of the universe and all who dwell 
therein, every nation, every tribe, 
every people and language stands be-
fore Your throne. 
In gratitude, we stand alongside our 
brothers and sisters to celebrate Asian 
American Pacific Islander Month, ac-
knowledging the first known Japanese 
immigrants in 1843, the Chinese labor-
ers who sacrificed their lives and dig-
nity to build the transcontinental rail-
road, the Vietnamese for whose free-
dom many spilled blood. 
We pause to stop and consider how 
You have brought them and countless 
others, Koreans, Filipinos, Indians, and 
Pacific Islanders, to these shores as im-
migrants, refugees, or even war brides, 
blessing their journeys with hope for 
the freedom and opportunity our coun-
try’s vast resources provide. 
Lord, we acknowledge and honor so 
many who have made significant con-
tributions to law and medicine, science 
and technology, arts and entertain-
ment. How humbled we are by the 
wideness of Your embrace and how in-
debted we are to the evidence of Your 
hand in all of creation. 
Free us, then, from our hatred or in-
difference toward those whom we per-
ceive as the ‘‘other.’’ Instead, reconcile 
us to Yourself and to our compatriots, 
that we may consider how, by Your di-
vine providence and grace, O Lord, we 
are a richer Nation because of the 
blessing of our diversity. 
It is in the unity of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize and celebrate Ms. Ju-
liana Urtubey, a Nevada teacher whose 
commitment to joyful and just edu-
cation has led to her well-deserved se-
lection as the 2021 National Teacher of 
the Year. 
Ms. Urtubey is a first-generation im-
migrant and bilingual educator who 
works in special education at Booker 
Elementary in Nevada’s Fourth Con-
gressional District. 
At Booker Elementary, she is known 
as Ms. Earth for beautifying the com-
munity with gardens and murals. 
She teaches her students to take 
pride in themselves, their identities, 
and their strengths. 
She is the best of Nevada, the best of 
our educators, and we are so proud of 
her.

HONORING ELY BLAISDELL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ely Blaisdell of South Fork, Pennsyl-
vania. Ely has accepted a fully quali-
fied appointment to the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy in New York. 
Ely is a senior at Bishop Carroll 
Catholic High School. He has two sib-
lings, Eban and Margaret. He is the son

the grandson of the late Herbert and 
Carolyn Kessler and Eva Stahr-Kessler, 
all of Johnstown; and Margaret and the 
late Mark Blaisdell of Wilmore, Penn-
sylvania. 
Ely is following in the footsteps of 
two of his uncles, Dan Kessler and Paul 
Kessler, who graduated from the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Academy in 1979 and 
1975, respectively. 
Madam Speaker, Ely Blaisdell is a 
dedicated member of his community. 
His passion for service and his commit-
ment to his education will serve him 
well as he heads to Kings Point, New 
York. 
Good luck to him as he enters this 
next chapter of his life, and I thank 
him for his service to our country. 
RECOGNIZING FALLEN 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize our fallen 
servicemembers as Memorial Day ap-
proaches. 
This weekend, I was proud to join in 
the dedication of the Fall River Viet-
nam Veterans Memorial Wall, which 
pays homage to the nearly 60,000 Amer-
icans who died in Vietnam. They were 
not always honored as they should 
have been by their contemporaries, but 
we honor them now. Liberty, justice, 
and democracy are ultimately pro-
tected by those who are willing to lay 
down their lives to defend these values. 
This coming Memorial Day, let us 
enjoy time with our friends and fami-
lies, a more acute joy than ever, after 
this past year. But let us also center 
ourselves on the true meaning of the 
day and reflect on the sacrifice and 
valor of those no longer with us.

REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF 
THE ATTACK ON SANTA FE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the vic-
tims of the heinous attack on Santa Fe 
High School on this day back in 2018. 
Three years ago, Santa Fe, Texas, a 
salt-of-the-earth town in my district, 
was confronted with an incomprehen-
sible evil. Instead of revisiting those 
horrendous acts of violence, today I 
rise to honor the lives that were trag-
ically cut short: 
15-year-old Aaron Kyle McLeod; 
15-year-old Angelique Ramirez; 
14-year-old Kimberly Vaughan; 
63-year-old Cynthia Tisdale; 
17-year-old Sabika Sheikh; 
17-year-old Jared Black; 
16-year-old Shana Fisher; 
64-year-old Glenda Ann Perkins; 
15-year-old Christian Riley Garcia; 
and 
17-year-old Christopher Stone, who 
was adventurous, understanding, and 
easy to talk to. 
Both Christopher and Christian have 
received medals of honor for the deed 
they did. 
Madam Speaker, it was a solemn day.

CONGRATULATING ABBY CROW 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a 
young woman from my district for her 
appointment to fill an important seat 
in the State of Iowa.

nolds appointed Abby Crow, a native of

Tiffin, Iowa, and a sophomore human 
physiology major at the University of 
Iowa, to fill the student seat on the 
State Board of Regents. 
The Board of Regents, which governs 
five public educational institutions 
across Iowa, first established a student 
regent position in 1973 to give students 
a say in decisionmaking. Since then, 
five University of Iowa students have 
served in this position. 
On April 28, Abby was unanimously 
confirmed to serve on the board, six 
years since the last Hawkeye student 
filled the seat. 
The student regent seat is incredibly 
important, and I have tremendous faith 
that Abby will be an excellent rep-
resentative for the university and for 
her fellow students.

CONDEMNING THE ACTS OF TER-
ROR AGAINST THE STATE OF 
ISRAEL 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, our Nation must be united in 
our condemnation of the acts of terror 
and stand in support of the State of 
Israel, our ally and strategic partner, 
the beacon of light in the Middle East. 
Hamas is a terrorist organization 
with the sole purpose of destroying 
Israel. Since last Monday, more than 
3,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza 
into Israel. 
One of my daughter’s close friends 
attended school in Israel. She has been 
awakened to rockets being fired over 
her head, and she has spent days on 
high alert, ready to run for shelter at 
any given moment. 
No country would tolerate thousands 
of rocket attacks against major cities 
and population centers. Israel has the 
obligation and duty to defend its citi-
zens against the violent attacks from 
Hamas. 
Israel is the only democracy in the 
Middle East. President Trump was the 
President of peace. His agenda was 
right, and the United States should 
stand strong as a friend to Israel. 
My family and I will continue to pray 
for the peace and safety of the people 
of Israel as they combat terrorism.

TITLE 
I—ORGANIZATION 
AND 
OPER-
ATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
SEC. 1001. DIPLOMATIC PROGRAMS. 
For ‘‘Diplomatic Programs’’, there is au-
thorized to be appropriated $9,170,013,000 for 
fiscal year 2022. 
SEC. 1002. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE 
OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE’S WORK. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) United States global engagement is key 
to a stable and prosperous world; 
(2) United States leadership is indispen-
sable in light of the many complex and inter-
connected threats facing the United States 
and the world; 
(3) diplomacy and development are critical 
tools of national power, and full deployment 
of these tools is vital to United States na-
tional security; 
(4) challenges such as the global refugee 
and migration crises, terrorism, historic 
famine and food insecurity, and fragile or re-
pressive societies cannot be addressed with-
out sustained and robust United States dip-
lomatic and development leadership; 
(5) the United States Government must use 
all of the instruments of national security 
and foreign policy at its disposal to protect 
United 
States 
citizens, 
promote 
United 
States interests and values, and support 
global stability and prosperity; 
(6) United States security and prosperity 
depend on having partners and allies that 
share our interests and values, and these 
partnerships are nurtured and our shared in-
terests and values are promoted through 
United States diplomatic engagement, secu-
rity cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
assistance that helps further economic de-
velopment, good governance, including the 
rule of law and democratic institutions, and 
the development of shared responses to nat-
ural and humanitarian disasters; 
(7) as the United States Government agen-
cies primarily charged with conducting di-
plomacy and development, the Department 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) require sus-
tained and robust funding to carry out this 
important work, which is essential to our 
ability to project United States leadership 
and values and to advance United States in-
terests around the world; 
(8) the work of the Department and USAID 
makes the United States and the world safer 
and more prosperous by alleviating global 
poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and 
other infectious diseases, strengthening alli-
ances, expanding educational opportunities 
for women and girls, promoting good govern-
ance and democracy, supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts, driving economic development 
and trade, preventing armed conflicts and 
humanitarian crises, and creating American 
jobs and export opportunities; 
(9) the Department and USAID are vital 
national security agencies, whose work is 
critical to the projection of United States 
power and leadership worldwide, and without 
which Americans would be less safe, United 
States economic power would be diminished, 
and global stability and prosperity would 
suffer; 
(10) investing in diplomacy and develop-
ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and 
(11) the contributions of personnel working 
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United 
States to maintain its leadership around the 
world. 
SEC. 1003. BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND LABOR. 
Paragraph (2) of section 1(c) of the State 
Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 
U.S.C. 2651a) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (A), by adding at the 
end the following new sentence: ‘‘All special 
envoys, ambassadors, and coordinators lo-
cated within the Bureau of Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Labor shall report di-
rectly to the Assistant Secretary unless oth-
erwise provided by law.’’; 
(2) in subparagraph (B)(ii)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘section’’ and inserting 
‘‘sections 116 and’’; and 
(B) by inserting before the period at the 
end the following: ‘‘(commonly referred to as 
the annual ‘Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices’)’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraphs:

port Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.); and

appropriately used and comply with anti-cor-
ruption practices.’’.

SEC. 1008. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
TRAINING TO NATIONAL SECURITY. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Department is a crucial national se-
curity agency, whose employees, both For-
eign and Civil Service, require the best pos-
sible training at every stage of their careers 
to prepare them to promote and defend 
United States national interests and the 
health and safety of United States citizens 
abroad; 
(2) the Department of State’s investment 
of time and resources with respect to the 
training and education of its personnel is 
considerably below the level of other Federal 
departments and agencies in the national se-
curity field, and falls well below the invest-
ments many allied and adversarial countries 
make in the development of their diplomats; 
(3) the Department faces increasingly com-
plex and rapidly evolving challenges, many 
of which are science and technology-driven, 
and which demand the continual, high-qual-
ity training and education of its personnel; 
(4) the Department must move beyond reli-
ance on ‘‘on-the-job training’’ and other in-
formal mentorship practices, which lead to 
an inequality in skillset development and ca-
reer advancement opportunities, often par-
ticularly for minority personnel, and to-
wards a robust professional tradecraft train-
ing continuum that will provide for greater 
equality in career advancement and increase 
minority participation in the senior ranks; 
(5) the Department’s Foreign Service Insti-
tute and other training facilities should seek 
to substantially increase its educational and 
training offerings to Department personnel, 
including developing new and innovative 
educational and training courses, methods, 
programs, and opportunities; and 
(6) consistent with existing Department 
gift acceptance authority and other applica-
ble laws, the Department and Foreign Serv-
ice Institute may accept funds and other re-
sources from foundations, not-for-profit cor-
porations, and other appropriate sources to 
help the Department and the Institute en-
hance the quantity and quality of training 
offerings, especially in the introduction of 
new, innovative, and pilot model courses. 
(b) TRAINING
FLOAT.—Not later than 90 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of State shall develop and 
submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a strategy to establish a ‘‘train-
ing float’’ to allow for up to 15 percent of the 
Civil and Foreign Service to participate in 
long-term training at any given time. The 
strategy should identify steps necessary to 
ensure implementation of the training prior-
ities identified in subsection (c), sufficient

training capacity and opportunities are 
available to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers, equitable distribution of long-term 
training opportunities to Civil and Foreign 
Service officers, and any additional re-
sources or authorities necessary to facilitate 
such a training float, including programs at 
the George P. Schultz National Foreign Af-
fairs Training Center, the Foreign Service 
Institute, 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Security 
Training Center, and other facilities or pro-
grams operated by the Department of State. 
The strategy shall identify which types of 
training would be prioritized, the extent (if 
any) to which such training is already being 
provided to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers by the Department of State, any factors 
incentivizing or disincentivizing such train-
ing, and why such training cannot be 
achieved without Civil and Foreign Service 
officers leaving the workforce. In addition to 
training opportunities provided by the De-
partment, the strategy shall consider train-
ing that could be provided by the other 
United States Government training institu-
tions, as well as non-governmental edu-
cational institutions. The strategy shall con-
sider approaches to overcome disincentives 
to pursuing long-term training. 
(c) PRIORITIZATION.—In order to provide the 
Civil and Foreign Service with the level of 
education and training needed to effectively 
advance United States interests across the 
globe, the Department of State should— 
(1) increase its offerings— 
(A) of virtual instruction to make training 
more 
accessible 
to 
personnel 
deployed 
throughout the world; or 
(B) at partner organizations to provide use-
ful outside perspectives to Department per-
sonnel; 
(2) offer courses utilizing computer-based 
or assisted simulations, allowing civilian of-
ficers to lead decision-making in a crisis en-
vironment; and 
(3) consider increasing the duration and ex-
panding 
the 
focus 
of 
certain 
training 
courses, including— 
(A) the A-100 orientation course for For-
eign Service officers, and 
(B) the chief of mission course to more ac-
curately reflect the significant responsibil-
ities accompanying such role. 
(d) 
OTHER
AGENCY
RESPONSIBILITIES.— 
Other national security agencies should in-
crease the enrollment of their personnel in 
courses at the Foreign Service Institute and 
other Department of State training facilities 
to promote a whole-of-government approach 
to mitigating national security challenges.

ment of candidates belonging to under-rep-
resented groups, including the Charles B. 
Rangel International Affairs Graduate Fel-
lowship Program, the Thomas R. Pickering 
Foreign Affairs Fellowship Program, and the 
Donald M. Payne International Development

ments vital for building a strong, capable, 
and representative national security work-
force.

SEC. 1309. WORKFORCE ACTIONS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WORKFORCE RE-
CRUITMENT.—It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of State should continue to 
hold entry-level classes for Foreign Service 
officers and specialists and continue to re-
cruit civil servants through programs such 
as the Presidential Management Fellows 
Program and Pathways Internship Programs 
in a manner and at a frequency consistent 
with prior years and consistent with the 
need to maintain a pool of experienced per-
sonnel effectively distributed across skill 
codes and ranks. It is further the sense of 
Congress that absent continuous recruit-

combat serious, significant corruption, in-

other countries to extradite corrupt actors;

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1157, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1157, the Depart-
ment of State Authorization Act of 
2021, which I have introduced alongside 
my good friend and partner, the rank-
ing member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, MIKE MCCAUL. 
H.R. 1157 is a comprehensive, bipar-
tisan measure that builds on the work 
of several prior Congresses to broadly 
authorize the management and oper-
ation of the Department of State. This 
sort of bill should be a regular part of 
our work. 
However, it has been nearly two dec-
ades since the State Department au-
thorization bill was enacted into law. 
With every passing year, this rep-
resents another missed opportunity to 
ensure the Department of State and 
our Nation’s diplomats have the com-
prehensive support they need to ad-
vance America’s interests around the 
world. 
While we have made progress over 
the last couple of years, including in 
2019, when the House passed an earlier 
version of this bill, we must finally 
seize the historic opportunity to do 
what we have failed to do in the past 10 
Congresses. 
b 1215 
Diplomacy and development are crit-
ical tools for advancing the United 
States’ foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives, for protecting human 
rights and the rule of law around the 
world, for deepening relationships with 
America’s longstanding partners and 
allies, and for forging new relation-
ships around the world. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic continues 
to threaten the globe, it has reminded 
us once again that diplomacy and de-
velopment are central to solving global

H2449 
May 18, 2021 
conflicts and emergencies, keeping us 
safe and healthy, and enabling our 
countries and our communities to 
thrive. 
But at the State Department, there 
are also several vexing management 
challenges that have gone unaddressed 
for too long, and the politicization, ne-
glect, and slashing of resources we saw 
during the previous administration 
made it harder for our diplomats to do 
their jobs. We must not only build the 
State Department back, as President 
Biden says, we must build it back bet-
ter. 
To be clear, diplomacy and develop-
ment are not just about policy, but 
about the brave and dedicated public 
servants who work tirelessly to keep 
our country safe. Yet, while the De-
partment of State represents the inter-
ests of the American people abroad, it 
has not looked like the America it 
serves. So, among the many important 
management-related provisions in H.R. 
1157, I am particularly proud of those 
aimed at ensuring a more diverse, equi-
table, and inclusive workforce. 
This bill mandates disaggregated and 
transparent data collection and pro-
vides for vital tools to improve the 
ability of the State Department to re-
cruit, promote, and retain personnel. It 
pushes for greater transparency and 
inclusivity in filling senior leadership 
roles and seeks to address the black 
box of assignment restrictions accom-
panying some State Department em-
ployees’ security clearances that have 
negatively impacted Asian Americans 
and other people of color. 
It also ensures that the Department 
can pay its interns, exposing many 
more young Americans from across our 
great country to the important work 
that the Department does around the 
world and ensuring a strong and di-
verse pipeline of talent over the long 
term. 
By shoring up other institutional ac-
countability and management safe-
guards, including to ensure cooperation 
with the inspector general’s investiga-
tions, the bill will also help to prevent 
the politicized targeting and impunity 
that has caused so much harm to the 
members of the workforce and their 
morale. 
We can, and we must, move this bi-
partisan legislation forward and get 
Congress back on track to doing right 
by our great diplomats, our develop-
ment professionals, and the American 
people we all serve. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure so that we can move it one 
step closer to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to commend 
my good friend and colleague, Chair-
man MEEKS, for his strong bipartisan 
approach on this measure to authorize 
the State Department. As he men-
tioned, it has been 20 years since Con-
gress has authorized the State Depart-
ment. This is our obligation under Ar-
ticle I of the Constitution, and for 10 
Congresses, we have failed in that mis-
sion. 
I am very proud today that, working 
with the chairman, we are going to get 
this thing done and send it over to the 
Senate. 2002 was the last time. In the 
nearly 20 years since that authority 
lapsed, we have seen too many tax-
payer dollars wasted on inefficient 
hirings and procurements, an expand-
ing bureaucracy, and an outdated IT 
system that left us vulnerable to 
cyberattacks from our adversaries. 
It is a fundamental duty of the For-
eign Affairs Committee to pass an an-
nual authorization bill, just like we 
pass a national defense authorization 
bill. This is necessary to fulfill our con-
stitutional oversight responsibilities 
and our obligation to be good stewards 
of the people’s money. 
For these reasons I am proud, again, 
of this bipartisan effort our committee 
has produced, as we often do. It will ad-
dress numerous longstanding difficul-
ties. It will fortify the Department and 
our diplomats with the tools needed to 
fulfill their missions to promote Amer-
ica overseas and enhance our security 
abroad. 
Among other important reforms, the 
bill before us will modernize the State 
Department workforce, eliminate out-
dated reports, bolster embassy and in-
formation 
security, 
strengthen 
the 
State 
Department’s 
diplomacy 
and 
anticorruption efforts, and reassert the 
Article I prerogatives of the United 
States Congress. 
As the United States faces growing 
challenges around the world, we need 
our Secretary and diplomats to know 
that Congress supports them, and that 
is precisely what this bill does. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank, 
again, Chairman MEEKS, for his great 
leadership and his team and staff for 
working with mine. This type of col-
laboration has been a hallmark of our 
work on this committee, and I know 
that it will continue to be so. 
Again, this bill having lapsed for 
nearly 20 years, it is long overdue. This 
bill deserves our unanimous support. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. KIM), an es-
teemed member of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to stand in sup-
port of H.R. 1157, the Department of 
State Authorization Act of 2021. I want 
to thank Chair MEEKS and Ranking 
Member MCCAUL for their efforts to re-
form the State Department, including 
offering improved job and skills train-
ing opportunities for foreign service of-
ficers. 
I am honored to have two amend-
ments included in this bill, the first of 
which I introduced separately as H.R. 
1244. Today many foreign service offi-
cers and State Department staff spend 
an outsized amount of their time com-
plying with duplicative and outdated 
reporting requirements mandated by 
Congress. 
H.R. 1244 repeals those requirements 
to streamline the flow of information 
from State Department to Congress 
and allow our foreign service officers 
to spend more time working toward ac-
complishing America’s foreign affairs 
objectives. 
I want to thank Mr. CONNOLLY for 
also working with me on this initia-
tive, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1157. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I think this is a mo-
mentous day for the Congress. I want 
to thank my friend and colleague, 
Chairman MEEKS, for his great leader-
ship in bringing this long-overdue au-
thorization bill to the floor. 
I also want to thank former chair-
man Eliot Engel, who I worked with 
very closely to get an authorization 
bill passed out of the House, just to see 
it fail in the Senate. I hope the Senate 
will not allow that to happen again. 
This is really desperately needed. It is 
a momentous day for the House. It is 
critical. It is bipartisan. It reclaims 
our constitutional prerogatives of the 
Congress and the full oversight role of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I 
think it demands our unanimous sup-
port. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
closing purposes. 
Let 
me 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
MCCAUL for his partnership in bringing 
this bipartisan bill to the floor. I join 
him in also recognizing former chair 
Eliot Engel and what they attempted 
to do in the previous Congress to make 
this happen. It would not have hap-
pened had we not had the work and the 
continuous cooperation of both of our 
staffs in putting this bill together, so I 
am thankful to them. 
When we talk about H.R. 1157, the 
Department of State Authorization Act 
of 2021, it is going to make the State 
Department better prepared to conduct 
diplomacy and meet the challenges 
that we have of the 21st century. 
Congress must make authorizing the 
Department of State a regular part of 
its legislative efforts. As the ranking 
member said, just as much as we pass 
bills for defense and NDAA, we must be 
sure that we are passing the State au-
thorization bill. 
What happens and will happen by 
passing this bill, we can ensure that 
State has the tools that it needs so 
that it can be more effective, more re-
silient, and more reflective of the 
America it represents abroad. This 
should be, and I hope all of my col-
leagues join me and Ranking Member

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and insert ex-
traneous materials thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive SCOTT for his leadership on this 
legislation, the Financial Inclusion in 
Banking Act. 
This bill would direct the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau’s Office of 
Community Affairs to identify causes 
leading to, and solutions for, under-
banked, unbanked, and underserved 
consumers. 
The office would be required to share 
its findings in a report to Congress 
every 2 years and coordinate with 
other Federal agencies to increase fi-
nancial education. Through these new 
requirements, this bill would provide 
important information about unbanked 
and underbanked consumers and ulti-
mately help drive solutions that can 
decrease the reliance on predatory fi-
nancing products, like payday loans. 
According to FDIC’s latest survey 
from 2019, more than 7 million Amer-
ican households, or roughly 5.4 percent, 
are unbanked. However, the survey was 
taken before the pandemic, and the 
agency noted it would likely result in 
an increase in the unbanked rate. 
Even some individuals and families 
that may have a bank account still end 
up utilizing other forms of credit, like 
a pawn shop or payday loan, which are 
typically more expensive than bank 
credit. Nearly 5 percent of all house-
holds utilize these products, but again, 
these are prepandemic numbers, and we 
know millions have lost their jobs and 
may turn to these other forms of cred-
it. 
Moreover, access to traditional bank-
ing accounts is one way to expedi-
tiously deliver government stimulus 
deposits to individuals and families 
that need help quickly. 
Access to banking is a racial justice 
issue, as well. According to the FDIC’s 
prepandemic data, 13.8 percent of Black 
households and 12.2 percent of Latinx 
households are unbanked, compared to 
just 2.5 percent of White households. 
Everyone deserves access to safe, re-
liable, and affordable banking options 
in order to grow their savings, build 
credit, and conduct financial trans-
actions in a secure way. This bill would 
be an important step in achieving that 
goal. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. DAVID SCOTT) for introducing this 
bill, which has been bipartisan for sev-
eral Congresses. 
According to data from the FDIC’s 
survey of unbanked and underbanked 
households, 5.4 percent of U.S. house-
holds were unbanked in 2019. This 
means no one in the household had a 
checking or savings account. This 
translates, Madam Speaker, into 7.1 
million 
American 
households 
that 
don’t have that simple, straightforward 
needed access to a checking or savings 
account. 
While this is the lowest percentage 
rate since the FDIC began conducting 
that survey back in 2009, the number of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2451 
May 18, 2021 
unbanked and underbanked families is 
still disturbing. 
These statistics point to a staggering 
number of Americans who have limited 
or no access to traditional banking 
services. When I was in community 
banking before coming to Congress, 
there was nothing more empowering 
than having connection to and access 
to that financial system so that you 
can save for college, buy a home, ac-
quire that first car that you have 
dreamed of, or just conduct your 
household’s financing. 
So, over the years in Congress, I have 
supported efforts to improve financial 
literacy, particularly with my friend, 
Dr. FOSTER. As a banker, I certainly 
worked with volunteers, helping fami-
lies understand the financial system 
and how they could have banking ac-
cess. This is a key issue that both the 
private sector and the public sector 
work on, on a regular basis. 
Mr. SCOTT
has suggested that the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau’s Office of Community Affairs 
continue to engage in these efforts and 
examine how to improve this situation. 
The Office of Community Affairs also 
partnered with the CFPB’s Office of 
Research and the Office of Fair Lend-
ing to examine credit deserts, where we 
don’t even have access to financial 
services, and better equip communities 
with the tools for financial education. 
Additionally, 
the 
Bureau’s 
Your 
Money, Your Goals program offers a 
variety of materials to help consumers 
pursue financial empowerment and re-
sources for organizations aimed at 
helping financially vulnerable individ-
uals and families. 
This is a key issue and, particularly 
in my rural State, a bigger challenge 
for rural counties, as we have some 
counties without a single financial 
services office. 
Despite the progress that has been 
made, credit invisibility remains an 
important issue, especially given the 
pandemic’s impact on American con-
sumers. 
By further directing the CFPB’s Of-
fice of Community Affairs to focus its 
work on the underserved, we are work-
ing to ensure those consumers are not 
overlooked. 
This bill reaffirms our goal in under-
standing credit invisibility and identi-
fying better solutions to deliver re-
sources. 
All Americans deserve access to basic 
financial tools that will help them 
achieve their financial independence, 
their pursuit of happiness. This bill 
takes an important step in promoting 
financial inclusion and providing ac-
cess to all Americans. 
I thank my good friend from Georgia 
(Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is approaching 
the microphone, for his work on this 
bill, and I thank my friend, Mr. 
CLEAVER, for leading today. I urge my 
colleagues to support the Financial In-
clusion in Banking Act, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the great gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is 
the sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. 
DAVID 
SCOTT 
of 
Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman very much for yielding. I thank 
my distinguished Republican colleague 
for his very fine comments. 
Madam Speaker, this is one of our 
most important bills because it is hap-
pening at a time when so many of our 
people are facing such ravaging finan-
cial problems and concerns. 
Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, 
which I worked hard on, as many of 
you did, and the creation of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau, we 
charged that agency with ensuring 
that consumers have access to safe, ac-
cessible, and affordable financial prod-
ucts. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, do you know 
that we still have 7.1 million of our 
American citizens who are unbanked, 
relying on pawn shops and payday 
lenders to get by? As this past year has 
laid bare, many families are just one 
crisis, one sickness, one broken vehi-
cle, one emergency from absolute fi-
nancial devastation. 
Without support from regulated, le-
gitimate financial institutions, these 
consumers are forced to turn to preda-
tory lenders and unsound products. 
They are at the mercy of some of the 
most 
unscrupulous 
characters 
we 
know. 
Our bill is a very strong bipartisan 
bill, which the gentleman from Arkan-
sas has articulated well. 
Madam Speaker, with this bill, we 
will prioritize the most underserved 
and unbanked persons across our great 
Nation, and we will be taking the first 
step toward improving access and af-
fordability in banking for all of our 
American people. 
I urge my colleagues everywhere to 
give this a unanimous vote on the floor 
later today. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON), a 
distinguished member of the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee and, as of 
today, the ranking member on our 
Fintech Task Force. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, fi-
nancial inclusion is very important, 
and I appreciate the bipartisan spirit 
that this bill was worked through in 
our committee. 
Frankly, not all things have moved 
through Congress in a bipartisan fash-
ion this year. Frankly, it has been a 
little more rare than normal. And, 
frankly, a lot of things in our com-
mittee, they haven’t been as bipartisan 
as we would like. This is something 
that has moved through our committee 
in that fashion. 
I appreciate the work my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle have put into 
this, and I look forward to the work 
that comes out of it at the CFPB. 
I think, as we approach fintech 
today, we have the opportunity to im-
prove financial inclusion for more peo-
ple, particularly the unbanked and 
underbanked. But its characteristics 
have to be permissionless. 
In the same way cash is so vital for 
the unbanked and underbanked, as we 
apply technology, it has to be where 
people aren’t dependent upon a third 
party to be able to get permission to 
move the money that they have earned 
between parties. There are people who 
want to use the power of central bank 
digital currencies or other means of 
control in our financial system to es-
sentially say: You are not going to 
bank those people, are you? 
Sadly, our Nation has a history of 
this. So, I look forward to the work 
that comes as a result of this. I encour-
age all of my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend from Ohio (Mr. DAVID-
SON). He spoke to this issue of fintech, 
which I think is very important and 
has the ability to actually open up 
doors for underbanked families and 
unbanked families at a lower cost and 
a more accessible way through smart 
technology. I think that is going to be 
important. 
I thank, again, my friend from Geor-
gia for his work on financial literacy. 
As a great Wharton graduate, he knows 
a lot about financial literacy, and I am 
proud that he shares it with all of our 
citizens and families across the coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank the Hill-Scott combination 
for this legislation. It also is, I think, 
a testament to what we can do if we 
work together. 
The Financial Inclusion in Banking 
Act, led by Representative SCOTT, 
would provide essential information on 
unbanked and underserved customers, 
as well as identify potential solutions 
to the reliance on unconventional fi-
nancial products, which often lead to 
predatory lending and cycles of being 
trapped in debt. 
Communities of color have been ex-
cluded from the traditional economic 
system due to historical discrimina-
tion. All consumers deserve access to 
less expensive and more secure main-
stream financial products. 
The House passed identical legisla-
tion unanimously by voice vote in Oc-
tober 2019, and I urge Republican and 
Democratic Members to join me in sup-
porting this bill again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLEAVER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1711, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

GHOST ARMY CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 707) to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal to the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal 
Service Company, in recognition of 
their unique and highly distinguished 
service as a ‘‘Ghost Army’’ that con-
ducted deception operations in Europe 
during World War II, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 707 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ghost Army 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
comprised of the 23d Headquarters and Head-
quarters Company, Special Troops, the 603d 
Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th 
Combat Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal 
Service Company and the Signal Company, 
Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops 
and the 3133d Signal Service Company were 
top-secret units of the United States Army 
that served in Europe during World War II. 
(2) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
was actively engaged in battlefield oper-
ations from June of 1944 through March of 
1945. The 3133d Signal Service Company was 
engaged in operations in Italy in 1945. 
(3) The deceptive activities of these units 
were integral to several Allied victories 
across Europe and reduced American casual-
ties. 
(4) In evaluating the performance of these 
units after the War, a U.S. Army analysis 
found that ‘‘Rarely, if ever, has there been a 
group of such a few men which had so great 
an influence on the outcome of a major mili-
tary campaign.’’. 
(5) Many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen- 
soldiers recruited from art schools, adver-
tising agencies, communications companies, 
and other creative and technical professions. 
(6) The first four members of the 23d Head-
quarters, Special Troops, landed on D-Day 
and two became casualties while creating 
false beach landing sites. 
(7) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
secret deception operations commenced in 
France on June 14, 1944, when Task Force 
Mason, a 17-man detachment of the 23d led 
by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, landed 
at Omaha Beach. Task Force Mason con-
ducted Operation ELEPHANT between 1 and 
4 July, 1944, to draw enemy fire and protect 
the 980th Field Artillery Battalion (VIII 
Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign. 
(8) Operation ELEPHANT was a prelude to 
21 full-scale tactical deceptions completed by 
the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops. 
(9) Often operating on or near the front 
lines, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
used inflatable tanks, artillery, airplanes 
and other vehicles, advanced engineered 
soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio 
trickery to create the illusion of sizable 
American forces where there were none and 
to draw the enemy away from Allied troops. 
(10) The 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service 
Companies, activated in Pine Camp (now 
Fort Drum), New York, at the Army Experi-
mental Station in March 1944, were the only 
two active duty ‘‘sonic deception’’ ground 
combat units in World War II. 
(11) Soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Spe-
cial 
Troops, 
impersonated 
other, 
larger 
Army units by sewing counterfeit patches 
onto their uniforms, painting false markings 
on their vehicles, and creating phony head-
quarters staffed by fake generals, all in an 
effort to feed false information to Axis spies. 
(12) During the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
Headquarters, Special Troops, created coun-
terfeit radio traffic to mask the efforts of 
General George Patton’s Third Army as it 
mobilized to break through to the 101st Air-
borne and elements of 10th Armored Division 
in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne. 
(13) 
In 
its 
final 
mission, 
Operation 
VIERSEN, in March 1945, the 23d Head-
quarters, Special Troops, conducted a tac-
tical deception that drew German units down 
the Rhine River and away from the Ninth 
Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross the 
Rhine into Germany. On this mission, the 
1,100 men of the Ghost Army, with the assist-
ance of other units, impersonated forty thou-
sand men, or two complete divisions of 
American forces, by using fabricated radio 
networks, soundtracks of construction work 
and artillery fire, and more than 600 inflat-
able vehicles. According to a military intel-
ligence officer of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is 
no doubt that Operation VIERSEN materi-
ally assisted in deceiving the enemy with re-
gard to the real dispositions and intentions 
of this Army.’’. 
(14) Three soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops, gave their lives and dozens 
were injured in carrying out their mission. 
(15) In April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
Company conducted Operation CRAFTSMAN 
in support of Operation SECOND WIND, the 
successful allied effort to break through the 
German defensive position to the north of 
Florence, Italy, known as the Gothic Line. 
Along with an attached platoon of British 
engineers, who were inflatable decoy special-
ists, the 3133d Signal Service Company used 
sonic deception to misrepresent troop loca-
tions along this defensive line. 
(16) The activities of the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company remained highly classified for 
more than forty years after the war and were 
never formally recognized. The extraor-
dinary accomplishments of this unit are de-
serving of belated official recognition. 
(17) The United States is eternally grateful 
to the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Spe-
cial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company for their proficient use of innova-
tive tactics throughout World War II, which 
saved lives and made significant contribu-
tions to the defeat of the Axis powers. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of ap-
propriate design to the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company, known as the ‘‘Ghost Army’’, col-
lectively, in recognition of its unique and in-
credible service during World War II. 
(b) DESIGN
AND STRIKING.—For the pur-
poses of the award referred to in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (in this 
Act referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall 
strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, 
devices, and inscriptions, to be determined 
by the Secretary. 
(c) SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Following the award of 
the gold medal in honor of the Ghost Army, 
the gold medal shall be given to the Smith-
sonian Institution, where it will be available 
for display as appropriate and available for 
research. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
the Congress that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion should make the gold medal awarded 
pursuant to this Act available for display 
elsewhere, particularly at appropriate loca-
tions associated with the Ghost Army, and 
that preference should be given to locations 
affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
The Secretary may strike and sell dupli-
cates in bronze of the gold medal struck 
under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover 
the costs of the medal, including labor, ma-
terials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead 
expenses. 
SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDAL. 
The gold medal struck pursuant to this 
Act is a national medal for purposes of chap-
ter 51 of title 31, United States Code. 
SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 707, the Ghost Army Con-
gressional Gold Medal Act. 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire for her work on this bill 
which honors the creativity and inge-
nuity of the men of the 23d Head-
quarters, Special Troops and the 3133d 
Signal Service Company in conducting 
deception operations in Europe during 
World War II. 
The Ghost Army was a 1,100-man unit 
comprised mostly of individuals re-
cruited from art schools. They were 
from advertising agencies, communica-
tions companies, and other creative 
fields. They were tasked with using 
their creative talents to mislead, de-
ceive, and confuse the German Army 
and lure them away from Allied com-
bat units.

H2453 
May 18, 2021 
Following 
the 
D-day 
landing 
in 
France, the Ghost Army undertook a 
‘‘traveling road show’’ utilizing fake 
radio transmissions, inflatable tanks, 
and theatrical sounds and atmospheric 
effects to conduct elaborate ruses to 
deflect German units away from the 
actual Allied unit location and towards 
imaginary ones. 
The artists, architects, engineers of 
the Ghost Army were so effective that 
a later Army analysis of the perform-
ance found that, ‘‘Rarely, if ever, has 
there been a group of such a few men 
which had so great an influence on the 
outcome of a major military cam-
paign.’’ 
The bravery, ingenuity, and patriotic 
actions displayed by these citizen-sol-
diers remained highly classified for 
more than 40 years after World War II 
and were never formally recognized. 
This bill honors their unique con-
tributions to the war effort by direct-
ing the Mint to strike a gold medal in 
honor of the Ghost Army. The gold 
medal shall be given to the Smithso-
nian Institution, where it will be avail-
able for display and serve as recogni-
tion of this incredible service of the 
Ghost Army during World War II. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. KUSTER 
for her work on this bill, and I urge 
Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 707, the Ghost Army Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. 
I thank my friend from New Hamp-
shire, Congresswoman KUSTER, for pro-
posing it. I appreciate my good friend 
from Utah, Mr. STEWART, for cospon-
soring and helping bring this to the 
floor today on a bipartisan basis. 
Sun Tzu, in ‘‘The Art of War,’’ stated: 
‘‘All warfare is based on deception. 
Hence, when we are able to attack, we 
must seem unable; when using our 
forces, we must appear inactive; when 
we are near, we must make the enemy 
believe we are far away; when far away, 
we must make him believe we are 
near.’’ 
That was the philosophy that led to 
the formation of the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal 
Service Company, known as the Ghost 
Army. 
H.R. 707 will award a Congressional 
Gold Medal to the U.S. Army’s 23d 
Headquarters, Special Troops and the 
3133d Signal Service Company to honor 
their bravery displayed during World 
War II. 
The Ghost Army, unlike many other 
units, was comprised, as my friend 
from Missouri said, of civilian soldiers 
who had a proclivity for art, architec-
ture, acting, set design, and engineer-
ing. During World War II, the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops successfully 
tricked German forces into believing 
that 1,000 soldiers were a massive force 
of over 30,000, and they were able to put 
on 22 large-scale deceptions in Europe 
during World War II. 
Madam Speaker, now, this is an ex-
ample where both sides of the aisle can 
agree that fake news can be good. 
They did this by using inflatable 
tanks, aircraft, and speakers broad-
casting the sounds of men and military 
that were not there. The unit was able 
to pull German attention on these 
areas and away from the Allied force 
operations. This army, these men and 
women, are credited for saving thou-
sands of lives. 
Madam Speaker, one of those might 
have been my father-in-law, who was in 
Patton’s 8th Army as an engineering 
officer, trudging across from D-day to 
Germany. So we are all grateful, all of 
the descendants of those who served on 
the beaches and on the continent of 
Europe at the end of the war. 
Madam Speaker, I am a history buff 
as well, and anybody who has watched 
The History Channel’s World War II 
documentary has undoubtedly seen the 
Ghost Army in action. The historic 
videos and Herculean photo of four men 
holding a tank over their heads is tes-
timony to the Ghost Army’s ingenuity 
and bravery in the World War. 
Madam Speaker, the Ghost Army of 
World War II deserves to be com-
mended in this way, and I thank my 
friends from New Hampshire and Utah 
for their work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, when 
I say ‘‘war hero,’’ what image comes to 
mind? 
Some might imagine a brave soldier 
charging an enemy position, who re-
minds us of what it means to be coura-
geous. Others might think of a medic 
dodging enemy fire to provide care for 
their wounded brother-in-arms, who re-
minds us of what it means to be self-
less. And, still, others might think of a 
prisoner of war, like my father, a pilot 
in World War II, who was shot down on 
D-day and whose stoic survival through 
inhumane conditions reminds us of 
what it means to be resilient. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of another type of war hero: 
Those who go to war armed only with 
illusion and creativity. 
In World War II, two top-secret units, 
known as the Ghost Army, used com-
bat deception to fool the Nazis. They 
risked their lives to draw forces away 
from American combat units so that 
they would face less resistance. This 
required a special kind of courage. 
Whereas a typical American unit had 
tanks made of steel, the Ghost Army 
was equipped with tanks made of rub-
ber. 
Using inflatable equipment, sound ef-
fects, radio trickery, and imperson-
ation, the Ghost Army made it appear 
there were tens of thousands of combat 
troops where there really were none. In 
operations throughout the war, their 
actions were decisive. 
In September of 1944, they filled a 25- 
mile gap in Patton’s line that had 
opened up after he charged across 
France. In March of 1945, they imper-
sonated two full divisions to draw 
enemy attention away from the Ninth 
Army’s crossing of the Rhine River. 
Their combat deceptions worked bril-
liantly. 
According to a U.S. Army analysis 
after the war, the Ghost Army decep-
tion saved up to an estimated 30,000 Al-
lied lives. Their tactics were so effec-
tive that the Army kept them secret 
for more than 50 years after the war. 
And because of this classification, the 
men of the Ghost Army were never rec-
ognized for their heroism and contribu-
tions to defeating fascism in Europe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New Hampshire. 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, H.R. 
707, the Ghost Army Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, would right this wrong 
by awarding the Congressional Gold 
Medal to the Ghost Army. 
I am proud that 75 years after their 
service, with the help of my colleague 
from Utah, Mr. STEWART, the Ghost 
Army will finally get some recognition 
that it so deserves. I thank my col-
league for his help. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
our colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. STEWART), the cosponsor of this 
important legislation to recognize the 
Ghost Army. 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member, Mr. HILL, 
and my colleagues. I especially thank 
my cosponsor from New Hampshire for 
her support and her words today. 
Madam Speaker, much has been said, 
so I will be brief. 
I obviously stand before you in sup-
port of awarding the Ghost Army vet-
erans the Congressional Gold Medal. 
For more than 40 years, this World War 
II unit of more than 1,000 soldiers was 
nothing more than a myth; a bit of a 
ghost, if you will. More than 20 years 
ago, their heroic actions were still 
classified until, finally, we could learn 
the things that they had done. 
Today, I ask my colleagues again, 
both Democrat and Republican, to join 
me in giving these men and women the 
recognition that they really deserve. 
During our Nation’s darkest hour, 
the Ghost Army did not shy away from 
the fight. They saved thousands of 
lives. They stood eye-to-eye against 
the axis of evil. They defeated fascism 
in Europe. To do so, many of them 
made the ultimate sacrifice. 
For those heroes who returned home, 
no one knew of their courage and sac-
rifice; neither did many of them know 
of the great success that the Ghost 
Army had had. They kept their top-se-
cret mission and the operations they 
did even away from their friends and 
family.

But, still, they have not been yet rec-
ognized by the Army or by this Con-
gressional body. We have the oppor-
tunity to right that wrong. 
Today, there are only 11 members of 
more than 1,000 of the original Ghost 
Army who still remain alive. And to 
this day, they continue to embody the 
ideals that Americans strive for: Duty, 
honor, sacrifice, courage, service. 
Let’s pass this bill. Let’s give the 
Ghost Army heroes the highest honor 
that we can. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Utah for his important closing 
words to support this important bill, 
H.R. 707. 
What better tribute to those families 
of the 1,000 who served in the Ghost 
Army, and those 11 who we still cele-
brate as being alive with us today than 
the recognition they deserve, because 
those 1,000 saved the lives of thousands 
more in the Allied force as we com-
pleted our task of ridding Europe of 
fascism. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends from 
Utah and New Hampshire for their 
leadership on this bill. I thank Chair-
man CLEAVER today for guiding our de-
bate, and I encourage everyone in the 
House to support H.R. 707. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is one of the 
most amazing things that I have had 
the opportunity to support since I have 
been in Congress. And this bill is sim-
ply amazing. It ensures official rec-
ognition of creativity and innovation 
displayed by members of the Ghost 
Army in saving lives, contributing to 
the defeat of the axis powers during 
World War II. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. KUSTER for 
her work in ensuring recognition of 
this brave and talented group of cit-
izen-soldiers and their unique contribu-
tions to the war effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3146, the Securing America’s 
Vaccines for Emergencies Act of 2021, 
introduced 
by 
my 
colleague, 
Mr. 
FRENCH HILL. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has clearly 
demonstrated that ensuring the avail-
ability of the essential medical sup-
plies, articles, and equipment to fight 
disease is essential to our national de-
fense. This bill would better equip us to 
respond to the current pandemic, as 
well as future public health emer-
gencies, by amending the Defense Pro-
duction Act of 1950, to ensure that the 
definition of national defense includes 
the availability of medical articles. 
H.R. 3146 strengthens our ability to 
respond to public health emergencies 
through measures designed to secure 
the drug supply chain. Specifically, the 
bill requires the development of a 
strategy on securing supply chains for 
medical articles. This includes report-
ing to Congress on an analysis of exist-
ing supply chain vulnerabilities for 
medical articles and recommendations 
to address these vulnerabilities, includ-
ing measures to diversify supply chains 
and other efforts to mitigate risk, 
while promoting American competi-
tiveness, scientific leadership, and in-
dustrial innovation in this area. 
This bill will also provide for invest-
ment in supply chain security for eligi-
ble entities if the President certifies to 
Congress that such an investment is 
important to meet the national defense 
needs of the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HILL for his 
work in ensuring that we, as a country, 
learn the lessons from this COVID–19 
pandemic and are better prepared to re-
spond to the next public health emer-
gency because of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3146, the Securing America’s 
Vaccines for Emergencies Act, the 
SAVE Act. I want to thank my friend 
from California, JUAN VARGAS, a col-
league on the House Financial Services 
Committee, for our collaboration on 
looking at the Defense Production 
Act—we are going to talk about it 
today—and how we could improve it for 
better preparing the United States for 
a global pandemic. 
The SAVE Act amends that Defense 
Production Act to protect medical sup-
plies for Americans by bolstering our 
supply chain during times of crisis. The 
Defense Production Act, as my friend, 
Mr. CLEAVER, noted, was first signed 
into law by President Truman in 1950 
in response to a shortage of materials 
during the Korean conflict. 
Designed to incentivize production, 
avoid inflation, and, as I say, boost 
goods critical for the national defense, 
the DPA successfully brought Amer-
ican manufacturing to the forefront at 
the battle at hand at that time. 
Initially, 
the 
Defense 
Production 
Act, as you can tell by its name, was 
used in response for military needs, but 
over time the United States Congress 
has expanded it to other areas consid-
ered essential to national defense, and 
those include critical responses to na-
tional emergencies. 
When President Truman signed the 
DPA, he shared: It is your fight, the 
fight of all of us, and it can be won 
only if all of us in the fight can fight it 
together. At that time, he was saying 
that in response to the Korean conflict, 
but this quote still resonates with us 
now the same way as it did so long ago. 
A little over a year ago, our country 
faced another nationwide crisis that 
called on the need for the Defense Pro-
duction Act to be placed in the Amer-
ican spotlight. In response to a global 
health 
crisis, 
America 
experienced 
shortages of necessary medical sup-
plies, basically overnight. 
Supply chains were tested like never 
before, and it became increasingly 
clear that America needed to do some-
thing different in order to respond to 
the alarming increase in demand for 
medical gloves, N95 masks, and ven-
tilators. 
In my home State of Arkansas, our 
hospitals 
had 
medical 
materials 
stacked from floor to ceiling stamped 
‘‘Made in China.’’ And much of those 
supplies, Mr. Speaker, in the PPE cat-
egory ended up rejected and put in a 
dumpster because they did not meet 
the quality standards; they were out of 
compliance. 
Our national and State emergency 
stockpiles were prepared for a localized 
outbreak, not a national 50–State pan-
demic. Fortunately, President Trump 
invoked the Defense Production Act, 
which allowed for greater domestic 
manufacturing of these necessary med-
ical supplies. And while that was tak-
ing effect, the hospitals and our great 
Arkansas business, academic, and med-
ical community banded together to be 
able to coordinate critical supply pur-
chases, and even locally, manufacture 
badly needed face shields to protect pa-
tients and health professionals alike. 
Even more alarming than the lack of 
supplies might be our reliance on coun-
tries, particularly China, for basic 
pharmaceutical components. Our Na-
tion must develop a strategy to diver-
sify our supply chain to ensure that we 
are not in that same short supply situ-
ation in the future. In my view, last 
spring, Mr. Speaker, we were caught 
without such critical planning. 
That is why I introduced the SAVE 
Act in April of last year when we were 
first responding to these challenges, 
and I am pleased to have reintroduced 
it this year with my friend and col-
league, Congressman VARGAS. This bill 
amends the DPA to ensure that med-
ical materials are within that Defense 
Production Act scope. 
While all of us hope that we are near-
ing the finish line of COVID–19, we can-
not forget about the shortages that we 
once faced, because the reality is, un-
fortunately, perhaps likely, this coun-
try will face the same situation again. 
This bill allows us to be better pre-
pared for that future, whether it be in 
the short, medium, or long run. It will 
allow us to diversify supply chains that 
are required for our national defense. It 
will permit the United States to be less 
reliant on foreign countries like China 
for critical PPE or, most importantly, 
pharmaceutical ingredients or other 
medical products. 
The SAVE Act requires a national 
strategy and progress reports on the di-
versification of that essential medical 
supply chain. At the same time, it 
makes explicit that our strategy needs 
to take into account cooperation with 
our allies. We must maintain a strong 
trading environment that fosters con-
tinued innovation. Making critical sup-
ply chains more resilient doesn’t mean 
closing ourselves off from our friends 
around the world in partnership on 
these important items. 
Just to cite one example, Mr. Speak-
er, the Pfizer vaccine against COVID–19 
consists of 280 components sourced 
from 86 sites across 19 countries. Inter-
national 
cooperation 
makes 
treat-
ments like this possible. But we must 
ensure these items don’t fall under the 
exclusive control of an adversary. My 
legislation will help prevent that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support the 
SAVE Act, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. VARGAS). 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support my good friend, Rep-
resentative HILL’s, SAVE Act, H.R. 
3146. As my good friend from Arkansas 
said, I am proud to be the lead cospon-
sor of this bill. The tailored focus on 
this bill on the supply chain portion of 
the Defense Production Act will help 
us in future preparedness for public 
health emergencies.

May 18, 2021 
Among other things, it requires a de-
tailed plan from the President to se-
cure 
the 
medical 
material 
supply 
chain. Additionally, it amends the 
DPA, the Defense Production Act, to 
include medical materials among crit-
ical materials for which the supply 
chain must be secured. 
As my good friend knows, we need to 
be prepared not only for this pandemic, 
unfortunately, for other medical emer-
gencies that may come. We have heard 
that we may be entering an era of 
pandemics and we must be prepared. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend 
from Arkansas for his leadership, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill’s passage. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
California, Mr. VARGAS. We will be 
talking about this when we discuss his 
bill in a few minutes. We have collabo-
rated on this, and it is about planning, 
it is about a strategy, it is about not 
being caught at low tide with no bath-
ing suit, and that is what this country 
needs is a better strategy. 
President Bush warned us of that 
after he studied this issue when he was 
President. The stockpiles are impor-
tant. Our FEMA planning is important. 
But our medical supply chain and those 
critical components are critical to the 
health and safety of our country. It is 
critical to our ability to defend our-
selves, 
and 
hence, 
an 
appropriate 
amendment to the Defense Production 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on both 
sides of the aisle, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this time last year we 
watched as our brave healthcare work-
ers struggled all over this country to 
respond to the mounting COVID–19 cri-
sis, often with inadequate personal pro-
tective equipment and limited medical 
supplies. 
This bill ensures that we can direct 
our significant scientific innovation 
and industrial capacity towards ensur-
ing essential medical supplies are read-
ily available, and that our supply 
chains are resilient in the face of 
threats to our collective health and 
well-being. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Mr. HILL for his work on this impor-
tant issue, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLEAVER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3146. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
b 1315 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 3125, the COVID–19 Emergency 
Medical Supplies Enhancement Act of 
2021, introduced by my colleague and 
friend, Mr. VARGAS. 
The Defense Production Act of 1950 
provides the President with a wide 
range of authorities to enhance the do-
mestic industrial base to shift towards 
the production of goods and materials 
essential to the defense of our country. 
At the time this law was written, 
they did not anticipate that personal 
protection equipment, vaccines, and 
other medical supplies could be essen-
tial to the defense of our country. This 
pandemic has made abundantly clear 
that medical materials to ensure our 
public health are absolutely essential 
to the defense of this country. 
This bill would ensure that our Na-
tion has access to medical materials 
necessary to respond to the COVID–19 
pandemic by allowing certain medical 
materials to qualify for purchase and 
increased production under the DPA’s 
authority. It would also amend the 
DPA to ensure that the DPA’s authori-
ties could be used to address prepara-
tion for the next public health emer-
gency to help get the United States 
ahead of deadly future pandemics. 
Additionally, in order to respond to 
the evolving needs of local authorities 
to counter the COVID–19 pandemic, 
this bill would provide the Federal 
Government with the authority to 
allow State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments’ orders for qualifying goods and 
materials to be prioritized ahead of the 
Federal Government. 
Finally, to streamline engagement 
with the private sector on supply chain 
support for production of essential ma-
terials to counter COVID–19, this bill 
provides a framework that includes a 
dedicated outreach representative and 
reporting to Congress on purchases 
made and contracts entered into under 
DPA authority. 
I would like to thank Mr. VARGAS for 
his hard work in ensuring that the 
President has the necessary tools at 
his or her disposal when they respond 
to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3125, sponsored by my friend from Cali-
fornia (Mr. VARGAS). 
His legislation would help strengthen 
the oversight over this issue that we 
are discussing today of using the De-
fense Production Act’s authorities dur-
ing this COVID–19 pandemic. It also 
would help streamline the use of those 
authorities so that we ensure that the 
Federal Government’s response is co-
ordinated effectively with State-led ef-
forts. 
I was proud to cosponsor this bill 
with my friend from California. I think 
every Member of this House recognized 
that coordination challenge during the 
emergency, and it was challenging in 
some of our States to see surplus of 
supply in some States and not in oth-
ers. 
So Mr. VARGAS
has attempted to 
focus in during the pandemic on en-
hancing that coordination when we are

using the DPA. That coordination ef-
fort would work with private suppliers 
of medical items for more efficient and 
essential consideration when the U.S. 
is facing this kind of a public health 
emergency. 
Although the U.S. appears to be 
exiting the pandemic now, DPA au-
thorities are still in use to address our 
critical medical needs. We must be es-
pecially vigilant as the coronavirus 
continues to wreak havoc abroad, giv-
ing rise to potential new variants that 
the medical community will have to 
monitor closely. 
Of course, we are all now far more 
sensitized to the pandemic risks that 
may arise with little notice in the fu-
ture. Mr. VARGAS’ legislation provides 
a blueprint for deploying the DPA 
more rapidly should we face a public 
health emergency in the years ahead, 
all while allowing for appropriate, ac-
tive congressional oversight. 
I am happy to cosponsor my friend’s 
legislation. I appreciate the bipartisan 
work that we have shared undertaking 
this item in the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. VARGAS). 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the COVID–19 
Emergency Medical Supplies Enhance-
ment Act, H.R. 3125, because I agree 
with my good friend from Arkansas 
that we don’t want to get caught at 
low tide with no bathing suit. In fact, 
that is a very bad idea. 
The administration has been ex-
tremely effective in using the Defense 
Production Act to help produce vac-
cines and PPE. Following these efforts, 
cases and deaths have declined signifi-
cantly. My bipartisan bill will support 
the current use of DPA and facilitate 
its use in the future to save lives. 
This bill amends the DPA to explic-
itly include public health emergency 
preparedness as a core activity for na-
tional defense, as was mentioned by my 
good friend from Arkansas. 
It also provides guidance to create an 
outreach representative who would act 
as the point person for Federal and pri-
vate engagement to increase produc-
tion of medically necessary materials. 
It also requires the administration to 
provide a much-needed report clearly 
conveying 
the 
Federal 
contracts 
awarded under the DPA authorities. 
Finally, it requires additional report-
ing on the percentage of contracts 
awarded to small businesses. 
I 
urge 
the 
administration 
to 
disaggregate data on small businesses 
awarded the DPA contracts. We need to 
clearly see the number of contracts 
going to individuals from underserved 
communities, including communities 
of color, veterans, and individuals with 
disabilities. 
I am proud to have introduced this 
bill with my good friend from Arkan-
sas, Representative HILL; and also my 
colleagues as cosponsors, Representa-
tives TAYLOR, RYAN, and GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N. In a bipartisan manner, we have 
recognized the importance of public 
health emergency preparedness, includ-
ing PPE and vaccine production. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
I also want to say that too many peo-
ple in our Latino communities have 
died due to this virus. So, please, now 
that the vaccine is available, protect 
yourselves and protect our commu-
nity—get vaccinated today. 
Tambie´n quiero decir que demasiadas 
personas 
de 
nuestras 
comunidades 
Latinas han muerto por este virus. 
Entonces, por favor, ya que la vacuna 
esta´ disponible, prote´janse y protejan a 
nuestra comunidad—va´yanse a vacunar 
hoy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will provide a 
translation of his remarks to the 
Clerk. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I 
thank my friend from California for his 
attention to this effort, particularly 
with the Federal oversight of how the 
DPA is used; what we can learn in this 
extraordinary past year that we have 
experienced; and how we can be better 
prepared not only now as we assess 
those contracts and the use of the De-
fense Production Act in this pandemic, 
but how we, as I said, can have a blue-
print for the future. I congratulate him 
for his work and I appreciate his lead-
ership. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, so I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time, which 
will be very short like this bathing 
suit. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the les-
sons we have learned over the past 14 
months and builds on the DPA’s pur-
pose of harnessing our domestic indus-
trial base in the interest of national 
defense to ensure that we have the 
medical materials necessary to respond 
to the COVID–19 pandemic and to fu-
ture pandemics. 
I thank Mr. VARGAS for his vision 
and hard work in ensuring that our Na-
tion can bring together its leadership 
and scientific innovation and our im-
pressive domestic industrial base to 
support our collective public health 
and well-being through access to nec-
essary medical materials. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLEAVER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3125. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3008) to amend the National 
Housing Act to authorize State-li-
censed appraisers to conduct appraisals 
in connection with mortgages insured 
by the FHA and to require compliance 
with the existing appraiser education 
requirement, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and insert ex-
traneous materials thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3008, the Homebuyer Assistance Act of 
2021, which would make a common-
sense update to the Federal Housing 
Administration’s 
requirements 
gov-
erning appraisals to allow licensed ap-
praisers to conduct home valuations 
for FHA-backed mortgages. 
The current requirement to utilize a 
certified appraiser for all FHA loans is 
simply outdated as it was put into 
place at a time when there were no 
minimum Federal standards for State 
licensure of appraisers, leaving con-
cerns about consistency in competency 
across States. 
Now that we do have minimum 
standards for licensure, FHA’s certifi-
cation requirement is not only out of 
date and out of alignment with Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac, it is also cre-
ating marketwide pressures for lenders 
to require certified appraisers for all 
loans, even if they are not FHA loans, 
just in case the mortgage switches to 
an FHA loan midway through the proc-
ess. 
This, in turn, makes it harder for li-
censed appraisers to obtain work at a 
time when certain areas are experi-
encing appraiser shortages, and we are 
already struggling to effectively re-
cruit new and diverse appraisers. Li-
censed appraisers who are perfectly 
qualified to conduct appraisals for GSE 
loans should be just as qualified to con-
duct appraisals for FHA loans. 
I would like to thank Mr. SHERMAN 
for introducing this legislation; and 
the Republican cosponsor, Mr. VAN 
TAYLOR, for supporting this all-impor-
tant bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3008, the Homebuyer Assistance Act of 
2021, sponsored by my friend from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN) and cosponsored 
by my colleague from Texas (Mr. TAY-
LOR), who are both superb active mem-
bers of the Committee on Financial 
Services here in the House. 
The committee reviewed many of the 
issues faced by the appraisal industry. 
There were two concerns heard loud 
and clear from the witnesses: the pro-
longed backlog for appraisals and the 
decreased quality in appraisals used in 
transactions involving loans insured by 
the Federal Housing Administration, 
the FHA. 
H.R. 3008 addresses these concerns in 
two ways. First, the bill amends cur-
rent law to expand the pool of apprais-
ers eligible to participate in FHA-in-
sured transactions from being just cer-
tified appraisers to include both cer-
tified and licensed appraisers. 
Additionally, the bill addresses the 
different training requirements that 
each must meet. Currently, certified 
appraisers must have 1,500 hours of su-
pervised experience without any prop-
erty value or complexity restrictions. 
Licensed appraisers need only 1,000 
hours of supervised experience, and 
there are some property value or com-
plexity restrictions on licensed ap-
praisers. 
So H.R. 3008 sets minimum trending 
requirements for both types of apprais-
ers in FHA transactions. Certified and 
licensed appraisers must have at least 7 
hours of approved training by The Ap-
praisal Foundation or their State li-
censing agency. These changes will 
help break that logjam and bring 
FHA’s appraisal rules in line with the 
current appraisal rules used by our 
government-sponsored 
enterprises, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in the 
secondary market and in the conven-
tional mortgage market. 
Moreover, 
the 
changes 
that 
Mr. 
SHERMAN and Mr. TAYLOR proposed will 
help alleviate the appraisal backlog at 
the FHA and increase the quality of 
work being performed. That would ben-
efit both homeowners and taxpayers 
alike. 
As a former community banker in 
Arkansas, I understand firsthand how 
the appraiser shortage has been a prob-
lem in my home State. For example, in 
Arkansas, there has been a consistent 
delay in home purchases in rural areas 
because of the increased burdens that 
this shortage has brought about. This 
has created a ripple effect that has had 
a negative impact on the economies or 
in those neighborhoods. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends, Mr. 
SHERMAN and Mr. TAYLOR. I urge all 
Members to support this bill; and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1330 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN), who is a sponsor 
of this legislation. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank our 
colleague from Texas (Mr. TAYLOR) for 
working with me on this bill, the 
Homebuyer Assistance Act of 2021. I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
and the gentleman from Missouri for 
doing an excellent job of explaining the 
importance of this bill to the House, so 
I will be brief. 
There is no more important day in 
the economic life of a family than 
when they buy a home, particularly, 
their first home, and appraisers play an 
important role in that very important 
day. So this bill looks to bring into 
synchrony the rules of the FHA dealing 
with appraisers, the FHA being the 
third-largest Federal home loan fi-
nance agency, bring those standards 
into conformity or rough conformity 
with the two larger Federal home loan 
finance 
agencies, 
Fannie 
Mae 
and 
Freddie Mac. 
This will help deal with the shortage 
of appraisers that we are seeing in var-
ious parts of the country. Appraisers 
are an important part of the home-buy-
ing process for both lenders and bor-
rowers to provide assurance that the 
amount of the mortgage is supported 
by the estimate property value. 
Since 2010, all the State-licensed 
home appraisers have been required to 
meet minimum Federal education ex-
perience 
and 
examination 
require-
ments set by the Appraiser Qualifica-
tions Board. 
So the standards set by the Appraiser 
Qualifications Board are fully suffi-
cient for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
and they should be for the FHA as well. 
Unfortunately, until this bill passes, 
appraisers for FHA mortgages must 
meet the higher standard. This creates 
a shortage of appraisers who can do 
FHA appraisals. 
By helping address the shortage of 
appraisers that plague many areas, this 
legislation will provide much-needed 
assistance for first-time, low-and-mod-
erate income and minority homebuyers 
who rely on FHA mortgages or rely on 
mortgages that may become FHA 
mortgages during the process. 
Over 83 percent of the FHA home 
mortgages made in 2018 were to first- 
time homebuyers and over one-third of 
all FHA loans were obtained by minor-
ity households. I am pleased to say 
that with the support of this House, we 
passed the Homebuyer Assistance Act 
in 2019 with overwhelming bipartisan 
support, 419–5. 
Today, I hope the House renews that 
wisdom, and I hope to see a similar 
level of wisdom in the Senate. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend, the gentleman from California 
(Mr. SHERMAN), for his hard work on 
this bill. 
I hope that we are able to get it over 
the finish line and to the President’s 
desk. 
I 
appreciate 
Senator 
THUNE 
working on this in the Senate. 
It is an important piece of legislation 
that will aid, as Mr. SHERMAN outlined, 
first-time home buyers. A majority of 
this benefit speeds up that process for 
the family who is trying to buy their

enough in mortgage size to be insured

to do to speed access to the American 
Dream for low- to moderate-income 
families. 
I thank Mr. SHERMAN for his work, 
and I encourage all of my friends on 
both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 
3008, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SHERMAN) for bringing this legislation 
forward and for the support of the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. TAYLOR). 
This bill removes unnecessary bar-
riers 
to 
the

which will help millions of FHA bor-

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.

The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

INSIDER TRADING PROHIBITION 
ACT 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2655) to amend the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934 to prohibit certain 
securities trading and related commu-
nications by those who possess mate-
rial, nonpublic information, as amend-
ed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2461 
May 18, 2021 
This long-overdue bill creates a clear 
definition of illegal insider trading 
under the securities laws so that there 
is a codified, consistent standard for 
courts and market participants. This 
bill will help to better protect the 
hard-earned savings of millions of 
Americans and bring legal and regu-
latory certainty to U.S. securities mar-
kets. 
For nearly 80 years, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has sought 
to hold corporate insiders accountable 
for insider trading through general 
statutory 
antifraud 
provisions 
and 
rules it has promulgated under those 
provisions. This has resulted in a web 
of court decisions that generally pro-
hibit insiders with a duty of trust and 
confidence to a corporation from se-
cretly trading on material, nonpublic 
corporate information for their own 
personal gain. 
These insiders are also generally pro-
hibited from tipping outsiders, known 
as tippees, who then trade on the infor-
mation themselves, even though they 
knew it was wrongly obtained. But be-
cause there isn’t a statutory definition 
of insider trading, there is uncertainty 
around who is subject to insider trad-
ing prohibitions. 
Further, with various court deci-
sions, liability for this type of viola-
tion has shifted. For example, in 2014, 
an appeals court added a brand-new re-
quirement that the tippee must not 
just know that information was wrong-
fully disclosed but must also know 
about the specific personal benefit that 
the insider received. This decision has 
severely hampered the SEC’s ability to 
prosecute insider trading cases. 
According to Preet Bharara, the 
former U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, this decision 
‘‘provides a virtual roadmap for savvy 
hedge-fund managers to insulate them-
selves from tippee liability by know-
ingly placing themselves at the end of 
a chain of insider information and 
avoiding learning details about the 
sources of obvious confidential and im-
properly disclosed information.’’ 
I am pleased that this bill codifies 
existing case law and overturns this 
new controversial requirement, cre-
ating a clear, consistent standard for 
the SEC, the courts, and market par-
ticipants to follow. 
Last Congress, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed this commonsense 
bipartisan bill with an overwhelmingly 
bipartisan vote of 410–13. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
once again support this important bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, stopping and punishing 
bad actors for illegal insider trading is 
a top priority for House Republicans. 
This illegal activity hurts everyday 
Main Street investors as well as the in-
tegrity and efficiency of our markets. 
Trading on material insider informa-
tion in breach of fiduciary duty is cur-
rently prohibited by court-made law 
under the antifraud provisions of the 
Federal securities laws. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, the SEC, and the Department 
of Justice have the power to bring in-
sider trading cases, and both agencies 
regularly exercise this power. 
One body of insider trading law that 
has been developed is through the 
courts. Decades of judicial precedent 
are in place to protect investors and 
markets by punishing bad actors who 
illegally trade on insider information. 
Codifying nuanced case law and regu-
lations that have been developed over 
the decades into a single statute pro-
hibiting insider trading is a serious un-
dertaking, and the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) has tackled 
this challenging task. 
To be explicitly clear, this legisla-
tion’s intent is to codify, and neither 
expand nor contract, insider trading 
law as it is currently understood and 
interpreted by the Federal courts. 
Again, there should not be a single 
cause of action available under this law 
that would not otherwise be available 
to Federal prosecutors or SEC enforce-
ment attorneys under the already ex-
isting securities laws. I underscore this 
point because both Republican and 
Democratic SEC Commissioners have 
expressed 
concerns 
about 
Congress 
drafting a statute that accurately cap-
tures this expansive body of law with-
out expanding it. 
I agree with them. I think it would 
be tough to draft a perfect insider trad-
ing law. But with that said, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Connecti-
cut’s intentions not to expand the 
scope of current insider trading en-
forcement and his willingness to work 
with us in a bipartisan manner last 
Congress and again in this Congress. 
Specifically, Ranking Member PAT-
RICK MCHENRY’s amendment last Con-
gress, included in the base text of this 
year’s provision, provides the needed 
changes to align the explicit personal 
benefit test more closely with Supreme 
Court precedent. It also clarifies am-
biguous wording to ensure that judges 
and prosecutors know that this bill is 
not intended to expand or create new 
insider trading liability. 
Republicans will continue to speak 
out and support efforts to combat ille-
gal insider trading. We look forward to 
working with our colleagues on the 
House Financial Services Committee 
and in the Senate, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES), who is also a 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
EMANUEL CLEAVER for yielding, and I 
thank my subcommittee ranking mem-
ber, Mr. HILL, for a very good charac-
terization of the project we are under-
taking here. 
I will emphasize two things. 
Number one, at a moment when we 
are working hard to find ways to work 
in a bipartisan fashion in the public in-
terest, this is landmark legislation. As 
Mr. HILL pointed out, we passed it in 
the last Congress with a vote of 410–13, 
and that was the result of a very com-
prehensive and fairly technical nego-
tiation around the fine points of in-
sider trading. 
The second thing I would point out is 
that everyone in this Chamber should 
agree that law is to be made in this 
Chamber, not in the chambers of 
unelected judges throughout the land. 
While Mr. HILL is correct that there 
has been a vast body of court-made law 
around insider trading developed over 
the generations, that is far from ideal 
and, frankly, an abrogation of the leg-
islative responsibilities of the United 
States Congress. So, we are where we 
are. 
We have attempted to make clear 
and clear up a great deal of the uncer-
tainty, the reversed convictions, the 
activities in the Second Circuit that 
have overturned convictions and cre-
ated uncertainty in the law. This is an 
effort to make clear what I think ev-
eryone understands, which is that if 
you trade on information that you 
know to have been wrongly obtained or 
that you wrongly obtained or that you 
recklessly disregard was wrongly ob-
tained, you are doing something wrong. 
In this case, with the passage of this 
legislation, it will be clear that you 
have violated the law. 
I am excited for the passage of this 
legislation because I am a believer that 
it is, in fact, the elected legislators of 
this country and not the judges, as im-
portant as their role may be, who 
should determine what we consider 
wrong in statute and what we punish 
people for doing. 
Finally, of course, it is essential that 
everyone out there have confidence in 
our markets. Every time there is an-
other headline about an insider trader 
or a reversed conviction of insider trad-
ing, that confidence is damaged. So, I 
applaud the bringing of this bill to the 
floor. 
b 1345 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Connecticut for his vig-
orous defense, always welcome on the 
House floor, of Article I power here in 
the Congress. Both sides of the aisle 
are grateful for that, as we defend it on 
a regular basis. We thank him for his 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
HUIZENGA), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Investor Protection, 
Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets 
of the House Financial Services Com-
mittee to speak on the topic of this 
bill. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
with my friend and colleague from Ar-
kansas to acknowledge the work that 
has been put in by our colleague from 
Connecticut. This has been a long dis-
cussion that we have had various 
points where we have debated, and this 
is a positive thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2462 
May 18, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, pre-
venting fraud and abuse within our fi-
nancial system and cracking down on 
bad actors for illegal insider trading is 
a nonpartisan priority. We all believe 
that this is a good thing. In fact, this 
kind of fraud and illegal activity hurts 
everyday Main Street investors. It also 
makes our capital markets less effi-
cient, accurate, and fair to all inves-
tors. 
Now, current law prohibits trading 
on material insider information in 
breach of a fiduciary duty under the 
antifraud provisions of the Federal se-
curities laws. Let me just repeat that. 
Current law prohibits those activities. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission and the Department of Justice 
are the Federal agencies tasked with 
enforcing insider trading laws. Both 
agencies regularly use their authority 
to bring insider trading cases against 
these bad actors who violate our in-
sider trading laws. 
However, the bill we are discussing 
here today, H.R. 2655, is flawed and 
could potentially create even more 
confusion and uncertainty within the 
law of insider trading. It could expand 
liability for good-faith traders, which 
would 
weaken 
investor 
confidence, 
chill vital information-gathering, and 
hurt the efficiency of our markets. 
I believe it is important to note that, 
once again, the SEC is not asking for 
this bill or, frankly, any other legisla-
tive help on this issue. That is, the cop 
on the beat is not saying we need addi-
tional tools. Moreover, Democrats have 
not identified a problem within the 
current body of law that inhibits the 
prosecution of bad actors who illegally 
trade on material, nonpublic informa-
tion. Again, the regulators have the 
tools that they need. 
Republican and Democrat SEC chairs 
alike, with vastly different approaches 
to 
enforcement 
matters, 
have 
ex-
pressed concerns over Congress codi-
fying a prohibition on insider trading 
into one single statute, as we are 
doing. Specifically, they voiced con-
cerns that Congress would write a law 
that would be both overly broad, yet 
too narrow. Now, that is an odd phrase. 
Former SEC Chair Mary Jo White, 
during 2015 testimony—by the way, she 
was President Obama’s SEC chair—be-
fore our Financial Services Committee, 
when asked whether or not Congress 
should pursue an explicit statutory 
prohibition, stated: ‘‘I think it is chal-
lenging to codify it clearly in a way 
that is both not too broad and retains 
the strength of the common law.’’ 
Additionally, former SEC Chair Jay 
Clayton voiced similar concerns that 
Congress could write an insider trading 
law that is both too broad and too nar-
row. 
I want to commend the gentleman 
from Connecticut for his dedicated 
work over the years on this issue, and 
I appreciate his efforts to try and cod-
ify a specific insider trading prohibi-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an ad-
ditional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. However, codifying 
very nuanced case law and regulations 
that have been developed over decades 
to prohibit insider trading is a signifi-
cant task and undertaking. We all 
know that case law does oftentimes 
dictate the nuances. I fear that this 
bill could add more confusion and un-
certainty around insider trading law 
with rogue judges and prosecutors 
using the language to expand the 
bounds of insider trading laws. 
It was mentioned that this bill 
passed this body 410–13, and I was one 
of the 13. 
We have to ask ourselves: Why was 
the bill ignored by the Senate? 
There isn’t a compelling problem to 
solve is why it was ignored. This is a 
solution in search of a problem. 
I believe H.R. 2655, the Insider Trad-
ing Prohibition Act, which we are de-
bating today, is both too broad and too 
narrow, just as former SEC Chair 
White warned was possible, and I con-
tinue to be opposed to the legislation. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I must say, 
as much respect as I have for Mr. 
HUIZENGA—I have been around here a 
little while—I think this may be the 
first time I have heard from my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that the regulators deserve deference 
on this, that the regulators are not 
asking us to make a statutory change. 
I have never heard that in this Cham-
ber—this Chamber—which, under Arti-
cle I of the Constitution, is charged 
with writing the laws of this country. 
Apparently, my Republican friends, 
who don’t typically defer to regulators, 
are now saying the SEC is, at best, 
neutral on this law. 
Is there damage? 
I would urge anybody who wants to 
know about that to read the activities 
of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals 
in the overturning of conviction after 
conviction of hedge fund managers and 
others around points of technical com-
plexity. 
We make the laws. We don’t ask the 
regulators whether they would like us 
to, or whether they would cheer us on 
in making laws. We make the laws. If 
we are going to send people to jail, if 
we are going to stop the confusion of 
judge-made law, let’s do our job and 
pass this legislation. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. HUIZENGA). 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, let me 
throw out one name—I guess it is actu-
ally, technically, two names: Dodd- 
Frank. 
My friends on the other side wrote a 
massively expansive bill that did turn 
over all of that authority to come up 
and promulgate rules out of whole 
cloth. 
What we are talking about here is a 
very key word: materiality. 
We are having this exact debate 
about the environmental, social, and 
governance issues, the ESG of the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission, 
and the boundaries of those rules. This 
is the balance between making sure 
that the legislature and our constitu-
tional powers do not contradict the 
powers that are given to those regu-
lators. 
Yet, at the same time, we need to 
make sure that the regulators, based 
on case law, based on experience and 
the flexibility that they may need to 
go and do a law enforcement action, 
that they have those tools and that 
they are not pulled back from them. 
If the gentleman’s sort of example 
was to hold true, then we would have 
to eliminate all corporate law and 
every single publicly traded company 
that incorporates in Delaware. Dela-
ware’s entire corporate structure is 
based on case law and what has gone 
on. It is widely accepted throughout 
the United States that it is solid and 
positive, and that is what we are trying 
to do here today. 
We are not trying to hand over more 
power to the bureaucrats. We are try-
ing to make sure that the system that 
is in place, that everybody understands 
the rules of the road, that they then 
are going to be used to be enforced. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good 
debate. Again, I thank my friend from 
Michigan and my friend from Con-
necticut for the quality of that debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2655, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 2655, the Insider Trading Prohi-
bition Act, is a long overdue piece of 
legislation that simply spells out the 
definition of illegal insider trading 
under the security laws. It creates clar-
ity for participants in financial mar-
kets, and empowers the SEC to punish 
bad actors. 
This bill is supported by groups, in-
cluding the Council of Institutional In-
vestors, the California State Teachers’ 
Retirement System, the North Amer-
ican Securities Administrators Asso-
ciation, and Public Citizen. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLEAVER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2655, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

COVID–19 FRAUD PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2959) to establish the Consumer 
and Investor Fraud Working Group to 
help protect consumers and investors 
from fraud during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, to assist consumers and inves-
tors affected by such fraud, and for 
other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Representative AXNE for her leadership 
on H.R. 2959, the COVID–19 Fraud Pre-
vention Act. 
This bill would create a joint Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau 
and the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission fraud working group to better 
protect 
consumers 
and 
investors 
against fraudulent schemes during and 
after the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In the wake of the pandemic out-
break in the United States last year, 
millions of American families lost 
work and struggled to keep food on the 
table, pay their bills, and a roof over 
their heads. As early as April 2020, the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 
that more than 20 million workers had 
lost their jobs. 
As consumers across the country 
struggled with their finances and to 
stay protected against infection, preda-
tory scammers and unscrupulous ac-
tors have profited from consumers’ 
concerns and anxiety. 
Scams 
targeting 
consumers’ 
eco-
nomic stimulus payments and unem-
ployment benefits have delayed or pre-
vented consumers from receiving the 
resources that they desperately need. 
At the Subcommittee on Consumer 
Protection and Financial Institutions 
hearing held in March entitled ‘‘Slip-
ping Through the Cracks: Policy Op-
tions to Help America’s Consumers 
During the Pandemic,’’ Carla Sanchez- 
Adams, managing attorney with the 
Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, shared the 
story of a client she called Ms. Y, who 
lost her job because of the pandemic, 
fell ill from COVID–19, and became a 
victim of fraud. 
Ms. Sa´nchez-Adams said: ‘‘Ms. Y 
qualified for unemployment benefits 
through the Texas Workforce Commis-
sion. Ms. Y does not have a bank ac-
count, so her only option to receive her 
unemployment benefits was to have 
the funds deposited on a prepaid card 
. . . ’’ The Texas Workforce Commis-
sion ‘‘disbursed $6,000 in unemployment 
benefits through the’’ card. ‘‘Soon after 
receiving her card, Ms. Y got COVID–19 
and had to be hospitalized. When she 
was released, she tried to access the 
funds . . . and discovered there was’’ 
not one single penny left. ‘‘When she 
called . . . to inquire about the prob-
lem, she was told that someone had 
called, requested a new card be issued 
to an address in Michigan, and that 
someone in Michigan had used all the 
funds.’’ 
Ms. Y is, unfortunately, not alone in 
experiencing this kind of shameless 
profiteering during a national crisis. 
Representative AXNE’s bill would help 
ensure that consumers who have been 
impacted by fraud can report it and 
have access to legal resources to com-
bat it. It would also provide coordina-
tion between the CFPB and the SEC to 
combat these fraudulent schemes. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Iowa for reintroducing 
this bill. There is no doubt that 
fraudsters and other bad actors have 
been out taking advantage of con-
sumers during the pandemic because 
they are out taking advantage of con-
sumers every day anyway. Moreover, 
many of them are disproportionately 
targeting seniors. 
The Federal Trade Commission, look-
ing over the pandemic, has some 436,000 
reports of fraud amounting to some al-
most $400 million. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission has stopped 49 
companies from trading, suspended for 
concerns over misleading information. 
The Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, the CFPB, has gotten almost 
half a million complaints. 
So this effort among the regulators 
that Mrs. AXNE is proposing in H.R. 
2959 establishes the Consumer and In-
vestor Fraud Working Group. This 
working group includes representatives 
from the CFPB, the SEC, and is estab-
lished to help coordinate and share in-
formation across the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The working group will focus on pro-
viding resources to consumers and in-
vestors and help them avoid falling vic-
tim to the fraudulent schemes and 
scams that have occurred during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and after. 
In addition, the working group will 
produce a quarterly report to the 
House Financial Services Committee 
and the Senate Banking Committee. 
This will allow Congress to monitor its 
actions and resources as it is made 
public. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers and am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time until Mr. HILL yields back.

H2464 
May 18, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Missouri for his leader-
ship today on these House Financial 
Services Committee bills. I appreciate 
the hard work on a bipartisan basis on 
these measures. I have no additional 
speakers on the Republican side. I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 Fraud 
Prevention Act led by Representative 
AXNE would provide essential resources 
and support for consumers and inves-
tors to protect them against fraudulent 
schemes that have been rampant dur-
ing this tragic pandemic. 
The House passed this unanimously 
by voice vote in September of 2020. I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to join me again in supporting 
this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CHU). The question is on the motion of-
fered by the gentleman from Missouri 
(Mr. CLEAVER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2959, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 937) to facilitate the expedited 
review of COVID–19 hate crimes, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 937 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Following the spread of COVID–19 in 
2020, there has been a dramatic increase in 
hate crimes and violence against Asian- 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
(2) According to a recent report, there were 
nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian dis-
crimination and incidents related to COVID– 
19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 
2021, in all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia. 
(3) During this time frame, race has been 
cited as the primary reason for discrimina-
tion, making up over 90 percent of incidents, 
and the United States condemns and de-
nounces any and all anti-Asian and Pacific 
Islander sentiment in any form. 
(4) Roughly 36 percent of these incidents 
took place at a business and more than 
2,000,000 Asian-American businesses have 
contributed to the diverse fabric of Amer-
ican life. 
(5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander older adults, particularly 
those older adults who are recent immi-
grants or have limited English proficiency, 
may face even greater challenges in dealing 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, including dis-
crimination, economic insecurity, and lan-
guage isolation. 
(6) In the midst of this alarming surge in 
anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, a 
shooter murdered the following 8 people in 
the Atlanta, Georgia region, 7 of whom were 
women and 6 of whom were women of Asian 
descent: 
(A) Xiaojie Tan. 
(B) Daoyou Feng. 
(C) Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonza´lez. 
(D) Paul Andre Michels. 
(E) Soon Chung Park. 
(F) Hyun Jung Grant. 
(G) Suncha Kim. 
(H) Yong Ae Yue. 
(7) The people of the United States will al-
ways remember the victims of these shoot-
ings and stand in solidarity with those af-
fected by this senseless tragedy and inci-
dents of hate that have affected the Asian 
and Pacific Islander communities. 
SEC. 3. REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 7 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General shall designate an officer 
or employee of the Department of Justice 
whose responsibility during the applicable 
period shall be to facilitate the expedited re-
view of hate crimes (as described in section 
249 of title 18, United States Code) and re-
ports of any such crime to Federal, State, 
local, or Tribal law enforcement agencies. 
(b) APPLICABLE PERIOD DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means 
the period beginning on the date on which 
the officer or employee is designated under 
subsection (a), and ending on the date that is 
1 year after the date on which the emergency 
period described in subparagraph (B) of sec-
tion 1135(g)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1320b–5(g)(1)) ends, except that the At-
torney General may extend such period as 
appropriate. 
SEC. 4. GUIDANCE. 
(a) GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGEN-

SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes.

may order, as an explicit condition of super-
vised release, that the defendant undertake

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on S. 937. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act is important and timely 
legislation to address the disturbing 
rise in violence directed at Asian 
Americans during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Among other things, this legislation 
would help DOJ expedite review of re-
ported cases of hate crimes during the 
pandemic and provide guidance to 
State and local law enforcement agen-
cies for collecting better and more ac-
curate data. 
It also incorporates the Jabara-Heyer 
NO HATE Act, which includes meas-
ures to encourage the adoption and im-
plementation of the National Incident- 
Based Reporting System to facilitate 
the reporting of hate crimes by local 
police departments to the FBI. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken 
almost 600,000 lives in the U.S. It has 
also, unfortunately, deepened existing 
divisions in our country. Racist, hate-
ful rhetoric blaming the pandemic on 
Asian Americans fanned the flames of 
discord and resulted in a disgraceful, 
sickening, and ongoing spate of vio-
lence and discrimination against Asian 
people across our country. 
Stop AAPI Hate has collected reports 
of over 6,000 anti-Asian hate crimes and 
incidents since the pandemic began in 
March 2020. Just this month, they re-
leased four more heartbreaking attacks 
on Asian Americans in New York City 
alone. These cases are, unfortunately, 
part of a broader and deeply troubling 
uptick in hate crimes generally since 
2015, with a surge in such crimes in 
2019. 
This legislation addresses this dis-
turbing trend by helping policymakers 
determine 
where 
critical 
resources 
should be focused, identifying trends 
that can be interrupted, and directing 
public education campaigns. 
I thank my good friends, Congress-
woman 
GRACE
MENG
and 
Senator 
MAZIE
HIRONO, for championing this 
bill; Congressman DON BEYER and Sen-
ator RICHARD
BLUMENTHAL
for their 
leadership on the Jabara-Heyer NO 
HATE Act; Chairman STEVE COHEN, for 
holding an important hearing in his 
subcommittee on hate crimes and vio-
lence against Asian Americans; and 
Congresswoman JUDY CHU, you, Madam 
Speaker, chair of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus, for 
your tireless advocacy for the AAPI 
community. 
The Senate passed this bill almost 
unanimously. I urge my colleagues to 
do so as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We all condemn violence against peo-
ple based on their race. In America, no 
one should live in fear that they will be 
a victim of a crime based on their be-
liefs, the color of their skin, or the 
country in which they were born. 
We have seen reports of violence di-
rected at Asian Americans increase re-
cently in some places around our coun-
try. While the perpetrators of these 
violent acts must be held accountable, 
we have serious concerns about some 
aspects of this legislation and the proc-
ess behind moving it forward. 
For instance, the legislation sets up 
ambiguous hotlines for people to report 
anything they find troubling. These 
hotlines are separate from traditional 
law 
enforcement 
reporting 
mecha-
nisms, such as calling 911 or your local 
police 
department’s 
nonemergency 
line, and they could enable anyone to 
report anything that that individual 
may find offensive. 
All crimes should be reported, inves-
tigated by law enforcement, and pros-
ecuted. Telling the public that crimi-
nal complaints shouldn’t be reported to 
law enforcement but, instead, to a new 
unrelated State office creates unneces-
sary confusion and could harm public 
safety. 
In addition, this bill establishes on-
line reporting for complaints about 
‘‘incidents,’’ but, of course, the bill 
doesn’t specify what an incident is; no 
definition at all. This means, essen-
tially, that we are asking State gov-
ernments to act as speech police, and 
creates a precedent that could extend 
to any manner of things someone may 
deem offensive. 
We were hopeful that there could be 
a meaningful discussion and input on 
this bill, but the chairman pulled the 
bill from our scheduled markup in the 
Judiciary Committee last month, pre-
venting Republicans from offering any 
amendments. Republicans had a num-
ber of amendments that would have en-
sured that the reporting hotlines were 
focused on actual criminal conduct and 
not random citizen complaints. 
Finally, it is important to note that 
the Democrats have attempted to 
blame President Trump for this rise in 
violence against Asian Americans, but 
the facts tell an entirely different 
story. This violence, by and large, is 
happening in Democrat-controlled cit-
ies, 
many 
of 
which, 
interestingly 
enough, have defunded their police de-
partments. 
For example, New York City saw a 
223 percent increase in reported Asian- 
American hate crimes, while defunding 
their police over $1 billion. San Fran-
cisco saw a 140 percent increase in re-
ported Asian-American hate crimes, 
while defunding their police by $120 
million. Los Angeles, 80 percent in-
crease in reported anti-Asian hate 
crime, while defunding their police $175 
million. 
One report found that nearly 60 per-
cent of the reported hate crime inci-
dents from March of 2020 to February 
of 2021, the past year, were from these 
two States, California and New York. 
It sort of begs the obvious question. 
Maybe if we weren’t defunding the po-
lice, if these Democrat-controlled cit-
ies weren’t defunding the police, we 
would not have the rise in incidents 
and the rise in hate crime for Asian 
Americans. If money wasn’t taken 
from police and they were allowed to 
do their jobs, we would probably be in 
an entirely different position. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MENG). 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, for over 
a year, against the backdrop of a rag-
ing COVID–19 virus and an economic 
crisis, Asian Americans have been 
fighting an additional pandemic: the 
virus of hate and bigotry. 
Over 
6,600 
incidents 
of 
physical, 
verbal, and online attacks against 
those of Asian descent have been re-
ported since March 2020. Of these, 
about two-thirds were reported by 
women.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2467 
May 18, 2021 
Throughout this pandemic, over 2 
million Asian Americans served our 
Nation as frontline workers, including 
those in healthcare, and yet some of 
these same Asian Americans became 
victims of hate as they were com-
muting to or from work. 
Children as young as my two boys 
have been attacked on playgrounds in 
their own neighborhoods across the 
country in every single State. Elderly 
are being assaulted, tragically result-
ing in deaths. This culminated in the 
worst kind of tragedy, with the mass 
shootings in Atlanta. 
We need to address this hate once 
and for all. That is why I introduced 
the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act. I am 
proud the Senate companion bill, led 
by Senator HIRONO, passed in the Sen-
ate last month with resounding bipar-
tisan support, 94–1. 
The COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act is a 
necessary step to confront the second 
pandemic of racism and discrimina-
tion. We cannot mend what we do not 
measure. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to 
stand with me and vote for the passage 
of this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, as one of the first Korean- 
American women to serve in Congress, 
I am proud to rise today in solidarity 
with the Asian American Pacific Is-
lander community and in strong sup-
port of the Senate-amended, bipartisan 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, S. 937. I 
also note the concerns raised by my 
colleague, Mr. JORDAN. 
As 
we 
celebrate 
AAPI 
Heritage 
Month throughout the month of May, 
it cannot be ignored that the hate and 
bias targeting the AAPI community 
are on the rise. Hate against any eth-
nic group is unacceptable. This is not 
who we are as Americans, and it is not 
reflective of the country that wel-
comed me and my family into its fab-
ric. 
That is why I am glad Congress is 
coming together in a bipartisan way to 
take steps against the hate targeting 
communities like the AAPI commu-
nity. However, let’s also recognize that 
we cannot legislate hate out of people’s 
hearts and minds. We must treat each 
other with respect and see each other 
as Americans. I will continue to do my 
part, and I will always stand in soli-
darity with my AAPI community. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
thank you to my colleague, Congress-
woman MENG, for her tireless efforts in 
combating hate crimes during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and championing 
this legislation. Thank you, Madam 
Speaker, for your extraordinary leader-
ship as well. 
In the past year, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has not only been a significant 
threat to public health; in some in-
stances, it has brought out the worst 
impulses in people. Since the start of 
the pandemic, there has been a spike in 
hate crimes and acts of hate against 
Asian Americans, with thousands of re-
ported hate incidents across this coun-
try. Asian Americans have been ver-
bally accosted and frequently told to 
go back where they came from. Count-
less Asian Americans have been pushed 
to the ground, shoved, punched, beaten, 
and struck with weapons all across our 
country. We are still mourning the 
eight victims shot in an Atlanta spa in 
March, six of whom were of Asian de-
scent. 
Asian 
Americans 
are 
being 
scapegoated for the ongoing health cri-
sis. It is disgraceful, and we must act. 
By 
passing 
the 
COVID–19 
Hate 
Crimes Act, we are sending a message 
that hatred and bigotry have no place 
in the United States of America. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
b 1415 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY), and I ask unanimous consent 
that he be permitted to control the bal-
ance of the Republican time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today to condemn the discrimi-
nation and violence that our Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity has experienced. 
Between March and December of last 
year, nearly 4,000 firsthand accounts of 
anti-AAPI hate crimes were recorded 
in the United States. It is heart-
breaking to read the news stories of 
these crimes, and my heart goes out to 
all those who have been victims of this 
violence. 
I have experienced this type of dis-
crimination and racism firsthand. I 
have been called racist slurs and been 
treated differently because I am an 
Asian American. 
As a proud American and someone 
who loves this country dearly, I take 
this rise in violence against our Asian 
community very seriously. 
That is why, in February, the very 
first bill I introduced was a bipartisan 
resolution to condemn these crimes 
and encourage better coordination be-
tween State, local, and Federal govern-
ments to track hate against the AAPI 
community. 
Combating hate is a nonpartisan 
issue, and I am proud that my resolu-
tion gained bipartisan support. I am 
very disappointed that my bipartisan 
bill was not part of this week’s con-
versation and that we haven’t had the 
opportunity to vote on it yet. 
Despite my history of work on this 
and my personal experience, no one in 
the majority sought out my partner-
ship or input on the anti-Asian hate 
bills before us today. 
I would have welcomed the oppor-
tunity for partnership, and I would 
have thought that my colleagues would 
seek input from one of only two Repub-
lican Asian-American women in the 
House. Our voices matter in this dis-
cussion. 
I am proud to be standing here today 
to condemn these violent acts and sup-
port my community. 
While I disagree with my Democratic 
colleagues on many things, this is one 
area 
where 
we 
can 
find 
common 
ground. That is what bipartisanship is, 
disagreeing with someone but finding 
issues where there is an opportunity to 
work together for the good of the coun-
try. 
I will continue to work on behalf of 
our AAPI community in Congress and 
condemn hate in all forms because this 
is not a partisan issue. We are all 
Americans. 
I hope that, moving forward, we have 
an opportunity to hear from more 
AAPI voices and that we work together 
to put an end to hate. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, we 
are here today for Soon Chung Park, 
Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Hyun Jung 
Grant, Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng, 
Amarjeet Kaur Johal, Jasvinder Kaur, 
Jaswinder Singh, Amarjit Sekhon, and 
too many others. 
This bill is an important step to ad-
dress and prevent hate crimes as we 
deal with the root causes of hate and 
violence. That means providing basic 
economic security, including housing, 
social 
services, 
education, 
and 
healthcare. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote says that we won’t 
stand by as our children are bullied on 
playgrounds and our elders are beaten 
in the streets. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote says to Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders—Chinese, 
Korean, 
Indian, 
Vietnamese, 
Thai, 
Pakistani, Japanese, Filipino, Native 
Hawaiian, 
Laotian, 
Hmong, 
Cam-
bodian, Burmese, Bangladeshi, Bhuta-
nese, Indonesian, Tibetan, Sri Lankan, 
Tongan, Malaysian, Mongolian, Tai-
wanese, 
Fijian, 
Singaporean, 
Chamorro, 
Nepalese, 
Samoan, 
Bruneian, Afghani, Micronesian, and 
Marshallese—that we are visible and 
that we matter. 
We, too, are America. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, how much 
time is remaining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 121⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 14 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

H2468 
May 18, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank you for 
your leadership. I thank Congress-
woman MENG for her power and passion 
and the hurt that we saw as she pro-
ceeded to say something has to be 
done. I thank Senator HIRONO, the bi-
partisan supporters, and the Tri-Cau-
cus that was led to believe that we had 
to stand together as those who have 
been impacted by hate. I thank Mr. 
BEYER
for his initiative, bipartisan-
ship, and for reporting hate. 
It is important to note that there 
were nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti- 
Asian discrimination and incidents re-
lated to COVID–19 between March 19, 
2020, and February 28, 2021. During that 
time, race had been cited as a factor, 
and then the worst among many, sen-
iors being beat brutally to the ground, 
dying, injured, and hurt for life. 
Then, in Atlanta, the unspeakable 
occurred for seven women, six of whom 
were of Asian descent. 
It is time for this House, in a bipar-
tisan manner, as in the Senate with 
over 90 supporting it in its final pas-
sage, it is time for us to raise our 
voices emotionally and make a com-
mitment, no matter what color we are, 
as we see people of our color attacking 
Asian Americans, we should stand and 
be heard. No hate crime should be al-
lowed to stand. We, of course, have 
seen that all over. 
I ask my colleagues to rise to support 
S. 937 and the Beyer bill because no 
hate crime should be allowed to stand 
in America. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
this important and timely bill to address the ur-
gent issue of hate crimes. 
For the past year, I have expressed great 
concern about the increase in violence against 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. It is 
outrageous. Madam Speaker, many of us 
awoke in March to the horrific news that in 
suburban Atlanta, Georgia, a 21-year old 
angry white man murdered 8 persons at three 
Asian massage spas. 
Among the innocent victims were 6 young 
Asian American women who worked in the es-
tablishments. 
The suspected perpetrator of these brutal 
crimes has been arrested and charged with 8 
counts of murder. 
According to the Atlanta Police Department, 
the killer is reported to have told police that he 
has an issue, what he considers a ‘‘sex addic-
tion,’’ and ‘‘sees these [Asian massage spa] 
locations as something that allows him to go 
to these places’’ and ‘‘it is a temptation for him 
that he wanted to eliminate.’’ 
Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic in March 2020, there 
has been a significant increase in harassment 
and violence against the Asian American com-
munity. 
Unfortunately, this is not new; there is a 
long history of racism again Asian Americans, 
especially during times of social and economic 
unrest. 
Throughout American history, Asian Ameri-
cans are often blamed for the emergence of 
pandemics and diseases, even if the sickness 
originated far outside the Asian American 
community. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is no exception, 
as American citizens, and residents of actual 
or perceived Chinese descent, have received 
intense and unjust scrutiny, violence, and har-
assment as perpetrators associate them with 
the cause of the pandemic and resulting social 
and economic turmoil. 
And the racist practice of the 45th President 
of always referring to the coronavirus as the 
‘‘China Virus,’’ or ‘‘Kung Flu’’ certainly contrib-
uted to, and inflamed, an already dangerous 
climate for persons of Asian descent. 
Examples of additional violent physical as-
saults against the Asian American community 
over the last year include: 
A sixteen-year-old boy was sent to the 
emergency room after being physically at-
tacked at his high school by an assailant who 
claimed the boy had COVID–19 simply be-
cause he was Asian. 
An 81-year-old woman was punched in the 
face and lit on fire outside her home. 
A woman was kicked, punched, and hit with 
an umbrella in a subway station in New York. 
A man and his ten-year-old son were fol-
lowed to a bus station by a man who was 
yelling and cursing at them before eventually 
hitting the man over the head. 
A 61-year-old man was slashed across the 
face with a boxcutter on the subway in New 
York City. His injuries required him to receive 
nearly 100 stitches. 
A woman was doused in a caustic chemical 
as she took out the trash, resulting in chemical 
burns on her face, neck, and back. 
A 52-year-old woman was shoved to the 
ground and hit her head on a metal news-
paper stand. 
A 51-year-old man was beaten with his own 
cane at a bus stop. His injuries were so se-
vere, he lost part of a finger. 
In my hometown of Houston, Texas, we 
know all too well the fear, horror, and heart-
break inflicted on members of vulnerable and 
marginalized communities when they are tar-
geted by hate crime violence. 
Madam Speaker, hate crimes are among 
the worst atrocities that exist in modern day 
society. 
A hate crime is defined as the incidence of 
violence motivated by the actual or perceived 
race, color, national origin, relation, sexual ori-
entation, gender, and disability of the victim. 
Unfortunately, 
hate 
crimes 
are 
under-
reported for several reasons, including fear 
and intimidation. 
The Department of Justice must better focus 
its resources on prosecuting these hate 
crimes, and this bill is needed to help expedite 
investigations of these offenses during the 
pandemic. 
The bill also will provide greater support for 
prevention and community relations programs 
related to hate crimes, as well as improve 
data collection. 
We need to stand together to send a clear 
message that this kind of behavior will not be 
tolerated. 
We also need to stand in solidarity with the 
victims and communities impacted by these 
terrible crimes. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, 
so that we can send it to the President’s desk 
without delay. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my most capable and socially aware 
counsel to my subcommittee, the Sub-
committee 
on 
Constitution, 
Civil 
Rights, 
and 
Civil 
Liberties, 
who 
brought this issue to my attention long 
before the tragedy in Atlanta, the at-
tacks that have been launched upon 
people of Asian-American descent in 
New York, California, and other places 
in this Nation. 
We held a hearing after the awful at-
tacks in Atlanta, but it was because of 
the earlier attacks and the fact that 
attacks on any Americans because of 
their racial or national background is 
totally improper and wrong. Religion, 
race, national origin should not be a 
basis for any discrimination. 
I am pleased that these bills are 
being offered, that they are going to 
pass this House, and that, hopefully, 
they will pass the Senate. The report-
age will be better, enforcement will be 
better, and maybe we will see an end to 
this intolerance. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act. 
The past year has been one of the 
most difficult periods in our Nation’s 
history. And for some of our fellow 
Americans, the pandemic has also re-
sulted in an alarming uptick in ra-
cially based hate crimes. 
Racism, bigotry, and discrimination 
have no place in our communities. We 
must do our part to help stop all forms 
of violence here in America and all 
over the world. And I will continue to 
fight to help keep all families in Amer-
ica safe. 
That is why I was proud to cosponsor 
this legislation, which will facilitate 
the expedited review of hate crimes 
and strengthen hate crimes reporting. 
We still have a long way to go to en-
sure that those who commit these 
crimes of hate are held accountable, 
and we must do better at all levels of 
government to protect the most vul-
nerable among us. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
nobody 
in 
this 
Chamber believes that there isn’t work 
to do in the area of ensuring that 
crimes are not committed against any 
American but, in particular, due to 
their race, their color, their national 
origin, or anything about who they are. 
Many on this side of the aisle, includ-
ing the gentlewoman who spoke before 
from California, raised concern about 
the sort of nature of this legislation 
and a lot of the concerns that have 
been raised about its continued focus 
on hate crimes in many ways at the ex-
pense of our focusing on crime, crime 
itself. 
In the findings in this piece of legis-
lation, of course, we reference the ter-
rible tragedy that unfolded in Atlanta,

Georgia, and much of that was a rush 
to be included in the form of hate 
crimes when the facts being borne out 
in the investigation among prosecutors 
and the investigators in Georgia are in-
dicating that that was not at all or 
didn’t seem to be the motivation. And 
I use careful words like ‘‘seem to be’’ 
because, as a former Federal pros-
ecutor, I like to wait until you do the 
investigation before you jump to the 
conclusion of what the motive was or 
what actually went into the crime at 
hand. 
As in the words of Chief Justice Rob-
erts when he said that it is a ‘‘sordid 
business, this divvying us up by race,’’ 
I think we do our Nation a disservice 
when we spend every waking moment 
on this floor divvying us up by race. In-
creasingly, that is what we are doing. 
This legislation is well-intended, but 
this legislation, in the eyes of many in 
this body, is flawed, in terms of having 
in it things like the Health Equity 
Task Force or designate an officer or 
employee at DOJ whose responsibility 
shall be to facilitate the expedited re-
view of hate crimes. We have provi-
sions in the legislation to encourage 
the collection of data, encourage local 
law enforcement to collect data on 
hate crimes, but to seek to do so spe-
cifically to focus on hate crimes. 
It is the contention of many of my 
colleagues that this is, in fact, a con-
tinued focus of division in our country, 
rather than focusing on the fact of the 
crime itself, the murder itself. 
We all, of course, thought that the 
crime in Georgia was awful. But, again, 
the crime doesn’t seem to have been 
motivated by race, yet it is being 
brought into the context of a hate 
crime. 
Perhaps we should spend some time 
investigating 
sex 
trafficking 
and 
human trafficking in the form of mas-
sage parlors and people who are basi-
cally indentured servants or slaves in 
the form of the sex trade; the cartels 
that are along our southern border that 
are forcing young girls into the sex 
trade; the people who were bound in a 
car in Boerne, Texas, in suburban San 
Antonio, being forced into the sex 
trade en route to a stash house in 
Houston, Texas, because they were 
being run by the Cartel del Noreste of 
Los Zetas out of Nuevo Laredo—lit-
erally, just occurring in the district 
that I represent in Boerne, Texas. 
Perhaps we can focus on this kind of 
criminal activity and what that actu-
ally means for young women and young 
individuals in our country. 
b 1430 
We talk about is it a hate crime when 
we have seen data of a young Black 
male in San Francisco hitting an elder-
ly Asian man on the streets of San 
Francisco. We have seen that footage. 
It’s probably a hate crime, but it is a 
crime. If that guy was a White guy or 
a Black guy, it is a crime. It is a crime 
going after this elderly man, an Amer-
ican citizen. 
And I think when we think about jus-
tice, the reason the blindfold exists on 
Lady Justice is we are supposed to 
have blind justice. We all acknowl-
edged that we have not had blind jus-
tice at many points in the history of 
our country, but that blind justice is 
what we seek when we seek equal jus-
tice under law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, as we 
near the beginning of the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it is long past 
time to confront what my colleague 
and dear friend, Representative MENG, 
has described as the additional pan-
demic of hatred, violence, and discrimi-
nation against our Asian American and 
Pacific Islander communities. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
today. 
I would like to address our AAPI 
communities directly: I cannot know 
exactly what you are feeling in this 
moment, but as an openly gay Black 
man in America, I know what it is like 
to be marginalized and to be harassed 
because of who you are. 
I turned 34 years old today, and while 
the end product may look okay, there 
is a lot that I carry with me. I know 
what it is like to feel both invisible and 
exposed, both unseen and targeted. I 
know what it is like to have to fight 
for rights that you should just be able 
to take for granted. And I know that in 
the United States of America no one 
should ever have to feel this way. 
So what I want the AAPI community 
to know is this: As surely as the Earth 
revolves around the Sun, I will be with 
you always because we can only get 
through this together. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, as the 
gentleman said, as a 34-year-old, the 
end product may look okay. This 48- 
year-old may not be able to make a 
similar statement. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
wish the gentleman from New York a 
happy birthday. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for yielding. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has brought 
with it a deadly public health emer-
gency, an economic crisis, and a dis-
turbing rise in anti-Asian hate. 
Unfortunately, 
discrimination 
against the AAPI community is not 
new. From the Chinese Exclusion Act 
to the internment of Japanese Ameri-
cans, the U.S. has a long history of dis-
crimination towards AAPI immigrants 
and their descendants. This new wave 
of xenophobia has led to fear, threats, 
and outright violence. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
by 
passing 
the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act today, we 
are standing up for our neighbors and 
against discrimination. We take this 
vote during AAPI Heritage Month, a 
time to acknowledge incredible con-
tributions of this community and also 
the interconnection of the American 
story and our mutual security. 
I am proud to represent a large and 
vibrant AAPI community in my dis-
trict, and I have seen that community 
come together over the last year and 
joined to help their neighbors and de-
mand justice for all. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port this bill today. It is critical and 
long overdue. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act, which incorporates my bill 
with you, Madam Speaker—Ms. CHU, 
Representatives 
UPTON
and 
BUCHANAN—the 
Jabara-Heyer 
NO 
HATE Act. 
This is a bill my team started back 
in 2015 to respond to hate crimes in 
Northern Virginia, but it breaks my 
heart to hear about the abuse our Afri-
can-American friends in this body— 
Democrat and Republican—have expe-
rienced in the last few years. But we 
are very proud of our bipartisan, bi-
cameral creation of a bill to address 
the underreporting of hate crimes. 
I want to thank the families of 
Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer for 
allowing us to use their names and 
highlight why we are here today. 
I thank now-retired Representative 
Pete Olson and his team for being true 
partners on this bill, along with Rep-
resentatives UPTON and BUCHANAN. 
I thank Senators BLUMENTHAL and 
MORAN for leading the fight in the Sen-
ate and getting this packaged bill to 
the House. 
Most importantly, I thank JUDY CHU, 
GRACE
MENG, 
and 
RAJA 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. Without their voices, 
and without the leadership of Chair-
man NADLER, we would not be here 
today addressing anti-Asian hate, and 
we would not be moving this legisla-
tion forward today. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Virginia reminds me—and 
we have not discussed this—that I first 
met the gentleman from Virginia when 
I was in college at the University of 
Virginia and he was the Lieutenant 
Governor of Virginia, and I was an in-
structor for a golf camp that summer 
in Charlottesville for his daughter, I 
believe Stephanie. Pulling out of my 
memory banks. And that is where I 
first met him. Again, 20—whatever I 
was—23 or 22 years old, right out of col-
lege. 
But he reminds me that one of my 
college teammates at the University of 
Virginia was a gentleman by the name 
of Lewis Chitengwa. Lewis is not some-
body you all would know, but you do 
know the name Tiger Woods. And Tiger

May 18, 2021 
was asked after his infamous 1997 year 
when he won the Masters—obviously 
breaking down the color barrier at Au-
gusta Masters. He was asked if he had 
ever been disappointed in sports. And 
he said he was disappointed once when 
he lost the Orange Bowl, the biggest 
amateur tournament down in Miami, 
where you would expect that to be. And 
he 
lost 
it 
to 
my 
friend, 
Lewis 
Chitengwa. 
Lewis is the first Black to win the 
South African Open. It was a monu-
mental event, I believe in the early 
1990s, when he won that tournament 
before he came to the University of 
Virginia, where he ultimately grad-
uated. Unfortunately, he passed away 
20 years ago this summer from menin-
gitis. 
He had played golf in the Canadian 
tour in Vancouver and shot, I think, 
68–69 Thursday or Friday, and passed 
away Saturday morning. Talk about a 
pandemic. He passed away from viral 
meningitis. 
I raise Lewis just because Lewis, 
when he went home, he passed away 
that summer, they had to wait about a 
month to bury him because of the 
AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe, where he 
was from. 
Lewis was the recipient of unspeak-
able hate when we were in college 
around the Charlottesville community 
in the 1990s. And we would often dis-
cuss that and talk about that and 
about those changing times. But it was 
fascinating for me to watch a man like 
Lewis, who came from Zimbabwe and 
experienced a lot of what was apartheid 
in South Africa and being the first 
Black to win the South African Open, 
to him talking about the greatness of 
this country and justice in this coun-
try and what this country has meant as 
a beacon for people around the world 
and justice. And we talked about it at 
length. 
I understand the intent behind this 
bill, and I just want to say that I share 
that intent; and I know in speaking for 
Mr. JORDAN, who had to relinquish the 
time to me, that we share that intent. 
We 
just 
have 
serious 
reservations 
about defining hate crimes and going 
down the road of collecting data and 
the way we are doing it and how that 
divvies us up by race. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
CHU), one of the sponsors of this legis-
lation. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the COVID– 
19 Hate Crimes Act. 
Since the start of this pandemic, 
Asian Americans have been terrified by 
the near-daily attacks in our commu-
nities. Shocking videos like the fatal 
assault 
of 
84-year-old 
Vicha 
Ratanapakdee, and the horrific shoot-
ings of eight people at three Asian- 
owned spas in Georgia brought na-
tional attention to this issue, but it 
also showed that our national response 
to combating hate crimes is lacking. 
That is why today’s vote is so impor-
tant. The bill would create a new posi-
tion at the U.S. Department of Justice 
to better track and address COVID–19 
hate crimes. It also includes the text of 
the bill I co-lead, the NO HATE Act, 
which improves hate crime reporting 
by 
law 
enforcement 
and 
provides 
grants for community-centered solu-
tions to fight hate. 
After a year in which we have seen 
over 6,600 anti-Asian hate crimes and 
incidents, finally we are helping the 
Asian-American 
community 
fight 
back. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, there is no place in 
America for hate. Well, at least there 
should be no place in America for hate. 
There should be no place in our coun-
try for exclusion, for bigotry, or racial 
violence. 
And, frankly, I tell my friend from 
Texas, it is not enough just to say that 
we are against that. We need to do 
something. This bill takes a step to 
doing something. 
Disturbingly, over the past few years, 
we have seen these evils emerge out of 
their dark hiding places. While we have 
always struggled as a nation to con-
front hatred and injustice, this past 
year we have been tested in ways we 
have not seen in some period of time. 
Madam Speaker, in particular, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has unleashed an 
onslaught of hatred directed against 
Asian Americans, and other minorities 
as well. These men and women, our fel-
low citizens, have endured vile words 
and violent blows. They have been 
made to feel unsafe and made to feel 
apart. 
Congress is taking action today, led 
by my friends Senator HIRONO, Rep-
resentative 
MENG, 
Representative 
BEYER, and Representative CHU. I am 
so proud to align myself with their ef-
forts to make it clear that hate crimes 
against Asian Americans will be pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent possible 
and that they will never be tolerated in 
our country, ever, as they have been 
tolerated too often in the past. 
Representative CHU, as chairwoman 
of the Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus, has put forward a 
resolution 
condemning 
the 
deadly 
shootings in Atlanta in March, which 
killed six Asian-American women and 
two others. I am strongly supporting 
both 
her 
resolution 
and 
Senator 
HIRONO’s hate crimes legislation, which 
has already passed the Senate, 94–1. 
Mr. HAWLEY of Missouri was the sole 
exception, 
the 
Senator 
who 
gave 
thumbs-up to the insurrectionists. 
That bill is the companion to Rep-
resentative MENG’s legislation, and she 
has instructed my office she wants to 
see this adopted as soon as possible. We 
would have brought her bill to the 
floor, but she said, no, let’s do the Sen-
ate bill because it can move more 
quickly. And she deserves full credit 
for bringing this issue forward. 
Madam Speaker, I commend her for 
her tireless efforts to stand up against 
hate targeting in the Asian-American 
community and in every other commu-
nity—indivisible, one Nation. 
Together, as the Nation’s representa-
tives, we must make it absolutely clear 
that racism and intolerance have no 
home here in America. Very frankly, 
the people who look at this vote will 
not parse it. They will interpret it as 
those who are against hate and those 
who thought this bill wasn’t perfect in 
saying that we are against hate. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join in sending that message 
with a strong bipartisan vote on both 
of these measures. Let us reject hate 
and remind our Asian-American broth-
ers and sisters that we are one Nation 
indivisible, 
standing 
together 
and 
building our common future together. 
We haven’t always been that Nation. 
We haven’t always been the perfect 
union to which we inspire. Too often, 
we have held others who are not like us 
as less than us. That has been a trag-
edy of mankind wherever one lived. 
This is a small step, but it is an impor-
tant step. Let’s take it. 
b 1445 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I do think it is impor-
tant what the majority leader just 
said. I mean, first of all, we will never 
be a perfect union. All we can do is 
strive, of course, to achieve the ideals 
set out in our founding and throughout 
our history. 
But I do take issue; as the distin-
guished majority leader knows, I stood 
on this floor recognizing my concerns 
about January 6. But to suggest that 
the Senator from Missouri, Senator 
HAWLEY, is somehow giving a thumbs- 
up to insurrection, as opposed to en-
gaging in speech and debate about his 
beliefs and his beliefs under the Con-
stitution; I think that is wrong. 
And I think we are continuing to go 
down this road of back and forth on 
these issues, as opposed to having a 
deep discussion about what occurred 
and what didn’t occur. But, impor-
tantly, on this issue, you know, taking 
the Senator’s word that he has some 
concerns, as I do. 
I mean, I have sat here and expressed 
my solidarity and hope and desire, 
again, as a former Federal prosecutor, 
figuring out how to root out hate and 
stop crime. I happen to believe that we 
should do that through the lens of 
being color blind, and attacking our 
criminal justice system the way we 
should to try to root it out, but not to 
embed in our code the continued

divvying us up by race. That is just 
how I view it. 
That is how I view it with a number 
of friends of mine of all walks of life, of 
all political persuasions, of all racial 
persuasions; and I think that we should 
be mindful of that. 
And the majority leader, I think, 
gave it up a little bit in saying that, 
you know, this vote will be seen either 
as A or B, right? It will be seen as you 
are either for hate or you are against 
hate. That is, I think, one of the funda-
mental problems we have in this body, 
is that we can’t engage in a reasonable 
debate about what we are seeing here 
and concerns we might have. And being 
equally opposed to hate, or equally op-
posed, or wanting to go root out crime, 
but have a differing view about how we 
get there; that doesn’t mean it is A or 
B, you are for hate or you are against 
hate. 
But that is what we do; we drop a $2 
trillion, 2,000-page bill on the floor, and 
you say, well, you are either with us or 
against us. Vote for this bill, it is 
named fill-in-the-blank. Right? Come 
up with a great name, you can’t oppose 
that. 
Suddenly then, that is what is put 
out in the headlines, you know, CHIP 
ROY votes for hate, right, instead of 
having an actual, robust debate here on 
the floor about how we want to carry 
the country forward. I think that is 
what we ought to have. 
I actually enjoy this part of our job. 
I enjoy having numbers of Members on 
the floor engaging back and forth 
about these issues that are important, 
rather than just seeking the headline 
and running out to the triangle and 
giving a press conference, divvying us 
up further in our ideologies, or in the 
name of a certain or particular bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership in bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor. It real-
ly is representative of his lifetime of 
service to our country for liberty and 
justice for all, the term that our distin-
guished leader mentioned in his com-
ments—liberty and justice for all. 
I want to spring from that and talk 
about e pluribus unum. When our 
Founders established that as a prin-
ciple, as a guide, e pluribus unum, from 
many, one, they could never have 
imagined how many we would be or 
how different we would be from each 
other, but they knew we had to be one, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for 
all. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the leader 
for framing it in that way, and I thank 
the chairman for bringing us together 
around this legislation put forth by 
Representative GRACE
MENG, a real 
champion in Congress, who has long led 
the charge against anti-AAPI bigotry, 
and all forms of bigotry and violence, 
and who sees this impact firsthand in 
her district in Queens. I have visited 
her there, seeing the beautiful diver-
sity of her community, even diversity 
within the Asian-American commu-
nity, as diverse as it is, and the trust 
that they place in her, well-placed. 
And I salute CAPAC chair, JUDY CHU, 
an historic leader, who every day is en-
suring that the AAPI community has a 
powerful voice and strong representa-
tion in the United States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I was listening to 
the gentleman’s comments, and I was 
recalling when this resolution came to 
the floor last year, and the leader on 
the other side said: Nobody in the 
kitchen tables of America is talking 
about this. Another Member said that I 
was wasting the Congress’ time, as 
Speaker, to be addressing this AAPI vi-
olence, or any of the hate COVID ini-
tiatives. It was ridiculous to say we 
were wasting time. It is important, it 
is the work of the Congress. This is an 
issue for us, it is a value. It is a value 
that is reaffirmed by overwhelming 
vote in a bipartisan way in the United 
States Senate. 
I know that Representative MENG 
considered it a happy day when we 
were on the Senate side, in the leader-
ship of CHUCK SCHUMER, with Senator 
MAZIE
HIRONO, 
Senator 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH, our colleague, ANDY KIM, 
and, of course, our lead sponsor, GRACE 
MENG, as that bill was being brought 
forward on the Senate side, which, as 
we all know, received very strong, 
overwhelming bipartisan support. 
So, today, in the House, we see rep-
resentation in action as we bring to the 
House floor important legislation to 
address a grave and growing crisis to 
the AAPI community and our entire 
country, the COVID–19 Hate Crimes 
Act. 
And, again, I will salute MAZIE 
HIRONO
and TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, our 
leaders in the Senate, where the legis-
lation passed almost unanimously, a 
clear sign of the Congress’ unity on 
this priority. 
I, too, am blessed to represent a dis-
trict that is blessed with a large AAPI 
population. And I have seen, as have 
some of our other colleagues, firsthand, 
the hate crimes exacted against them, 
intensified since last year. Over 6,600 
incidences of anti-AAPI discrimination 
and violence from March of last year to 
March of this year, in all 50 States, 
have been reported: businesses vandal-
ized, seniors attacked, families living 
in fear, and hundreds more occur unre-
ported in the shadows. This is what we 
know. 
These attacks are even more shame-
ful in light of the heroism of our AAPI 
community 
during 
the 
pandemic, 
against which 2 million Asian-Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders are fighting 
on the front lines as healthcare pro-
viders, as first responders, our police 
and fire, and other essential workers. 
As a Californian, again, I have seen 
firsthand the pain in my community at 
an AAPI-serving healthcare clinic in 
Chinatown last month, and in con-
versations with the AAPI groups. We 
have these regular conversations at 
this time, sadly, taking this form. 
This epidemic of anti-AAPI bigotry is 
a challenge really, Madam Speaker, to 
the conscience of our country, which 
demands bold, effective, and immediate 
action. 
As the House prepares to pass this 
legislation today, I also join my col-
leagues in support of Chair JUDY CHU’s 
resolution condemning the deadly at-
tack targeting the AAPI community in 
Georgia last month. These shootings 
were a vicious and vile act that com-
pound the terror and pain that Asian- 
Americans and Pacific Islanders face 
each day. 
This bill that we have on the floor 
today, the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, 
will strengthen our defenses against 
any anti-AAPI violence, speeding our 
response to hate crimes, supporting 
State and local governments as they 
improve reporting, and ensuring that 
hate crimes information is more acces-
sible to the Asia-American commu-
nities. 
This legislation also includes bipar-
tisan measures to further improve hate 
crimes reporting and promote a better 
response to those hate crimes of any 
kind. 
Madam Speaker, it is really impor-
tant if we are going to address the mat-
ter, if we are going to help solve the 
problem, we have to have an account-
ing of what it is. As I said, 6,600 in the 
past year, a lot of it intensified toward 
the end of that year. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive DON BEYER for his leadership in 
the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, now 
as an amendment to this bill. This bill 
also builds on steps taken by President 
Biden, including his day one executive 
order to marshal Federal resources to 
combat xenophobia against Asian-Pa-
cific and Pacific Islanders, and his 
March 30 announcement of additional 
steps to combat anti-AAPI bigotry. 
Together, these steps would make a 
significant difference to address hate 
crimes in America, not only during 
this pandemic, but for years to come. 
This month, May, is AAPI Heritage 
Month, and in this month we celebrate 
the many blessings that the AAPI com-
munity has bestowed on our Nation 
over the generations. 
As we do so, let us honor those con-
tributions with action: ensuring that 
every Asian-American and Pacific Is-
lander and their families and loved 
ones can live with safety, dignity, and 
pride. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote for the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act, and ask for the Chu resolu-
tion condemning the shootings of Geor-
gia, when that comes up. I look for-
ward to seeing the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act go directly to the Presi-
dent’s desk, as it has already passed 
the Senate, and be swiftly signed into 
law in a strong, bipartisan way.

May 18, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong 
‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The gentleman from Texas has 
21⁄4 minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from New York has 41⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of this leg-
islation, and I thank my dear friends 
and colleagues, GRACE MENG and JUDY 
CHU, for their passionate leadership on 
this issue, and for leading the charge 
on this bill today. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, this country has witnessed a 
shocking rise in hate crimes against 
the AAPI communities. I am proud to 
represent New York City’s Chinatown 
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan 
and Brooklyn’s Chinatown around 8th 
Avenue and Sunset Park. 
It goes without saying that my con-
stituents, and every one of our con-
stituents, ought to be able to go to 
work, walk to the grocery store, or ride 
public transportation without fear of a 
bigoted, and even dangerous attack. 
We need to bring justice to all the 
victims of these heinous crimes. That 
is why passing this bill is a must. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ and let’s lead with action. Let’s 
send a strong message that hate and 
bigotry will not be tolerated in the 
United States of America. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to give voice, not just to the 80 
percent of my constituents whose her-
itage lies in Asia and the Pacific, but 
to all I represent; that we join with our 
brothers and sisters across our country 
in solidarity; that hate against any of 
us based on our race, our ethnicity, our 
heritage, is hate against us all; that 
this must end here now. 
I rise today to recognize my Senator, 
MAZIE HIRONO, a pioneer in her own 
right, who brought this message to us 
in anger and in faith. I rise today for 
my granddaughter, 2-year-old, Cadence 
Masako Ansdell, and for millions like 
her for whom we must, today, make 
this choice, that when they come of 
age, they will know only the harsh les-
sons of their past and not the tragic re-
ality of their present. 
Madam Speaker, I rise for us all. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, of which I 
am a proud cosponsor. I applaud the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act’s passage in 
the Senate, and I thank Representa-
tives MENG, CHU, BEYER, and Senators 
HIRONO and DUCKWORTH for leading the 
call to address the rise in hate crimes 
against the AAPI community. 
b 1500 
The COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act will 
help ensure that we are measuring the 
severity of hate crimes in this Nation 
so we can implement systemic change. 
It is time that we address the rise in 
hate crimes against Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders. We cannot ignore 
the fear and the heartbreak that 
plagues our AAPI communities. We 
cannot ignore the hate and the vio-
lence perpetrated upon the AAPI com-
munity. We cannot ignore the fact that 
there have been at least 2,800 incidents 
of anti-Asian hate in the United States 
since the pandemic began and 1,226 in-
cidents taking place in California and 
728 crimes in the Bay Area alone. Un-
fortunately, this is only a fraction of 
anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents 
that we know because so many go un-
reported. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act so that we can continue to 
fight against hate and violence and 
support justice, equality, and safety for 
the AAPI community. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, those who tolerate hate perpetuate 
hate. A brief story: I saw the picture, 
the film, the depiction of the lady in 
New York when she was approached by 
a man who kneed her in her stomach, 
forced her to the ground, and kicked 
her with his feet on multiple occasions. 
That kind of hate we cannot tolerate. 
He happened to have been a person of 
color. It must be known that regardless 
as to who you are, regardless as to your 
race or your color, Madam Speaker, if 
you perfect that kind of hate, you 
should be prosecuted to the fullest ex-
tent that the law allows. Those who 
tolerate hate perpetuate hate. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman 
from California earlier made a good 
point, and I am going to use my own 
words to paraphrase what she said 
when she said that we can’t legislate 
away hate. 
The perspective of many of us is that 
we don’t need new laws, we don’t need 
more committees, and we don’t need 
more bureaucracy. We need to give our 
police the resources they need to do 
their job. We need to make sure that 
we are rooting out crime wherever it 
may exist between whatever commu-
nities it may exist. We need more em-
phasis on family, more emphasis on 
community, more emphasis on the 
Lord Almighty, and less reliance on 
the Federal Government to make our 
communities better. 
As I said earlier, I can get into the 
intricacies of the bill, but we have al-
ready gone over it. The concern of 
many on my side of the aisle is in this 
continued sordid business of divvying 
us up on race and focusing on race. 
We have spent the better part of the 
last year rightfully concerned, focused, 
and outraged on what we saw with re-
spect to Mr. Floyd. But we have had a 
continued focus on race over the last 
year, and I think one can look at the 
impact on communities and the impact 
on Black communities throughout the 
United States’ cities, businesses that 
have been closed down, and crime 
sprees that have occurred and wonder 
what this continued focus on race is 
doing to better our great Nation. 
I would posit that we are a far better 
country when we follow Lady Justice 
with the blindfold and that we seek to 
achieve that recognizing our failure to 
do so in the past but seeking our desire 
to achieve that blindfolded justice 
going forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, our country is expe-
riencing a devastating rise in hate, par-
ticularly against Asian 
Americans, 
throughout this pandemic. The COVID– 
19 Hate Crimes Act responds to this ur-
gent problem and will help our govern-
ment position itself to act quickly on 
reports of hate crimes. It will ensure 
we have accurate data on the size and 
scope of the problem. With this infor-
mation, the Department of Justice will 
be better positioned to act on reported 
hate crimes and to prevent future ones. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation and to send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk without delay, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 937. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

by striking ‘‘May 20, 2021’’ each place it ap-
pears and inserting (in each instance) ‘‘July 
1, 2021’’. 
SEC. 5. (a) At any time through the legisla-

Speaker may entertain motions offered by 
the Majority Leader or a designee that the 
House suspend the rules as though under

measures described in subsection (b), and the 
Chair shall put the question on any such mo-
tion without debate or intervening motion. 
(b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) 
includes any measure that was the object of 
a motion to suspend the rules on the legisla-
tive day of May 17, 2021, or May 18, 2021, in 
the form as so offered, on which the yeas and 
nays were ordered and further proceedings 
postponed pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX. 
(c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant 
to subsection (a) concerning multiple meas-
ures, the ordering of the yeas and nays on 
postponed motions to suspend the rules with

withdrawn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 403, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Ex-
clusivity Act, under a closed rule. It 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. It 
also provides for one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H. Res. 275, the condemning 
the horrific shootings in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, on March 16, 2021, and reaffirming 
the House of Representatives’ commit-
ment to combating hate, bigotry, and 
violence against the Asian-American 
and Pacific Islander community, under 
a closed rule. 
It provides 1 hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
The rule deems as passed H. Res. 398, 
a resolution recognizing the forth-
coming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre. 
The rule amends H.R. 188 to provide 
recess instructions, suspension author-
ity, and same-day authority through 
July 1, 2021. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested rollcall votes on sus-
pension bills considered on May 17 or 
18. This authority lasts through May 
20. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
consider two timely and important 
bills. The first is a resolution from our 
colleague, Congresswoman JUDY CHU, 
condemning the horrific, shootings, in 
Atlanta, Georgia, in March, and con-
firming the House of Representatives’ 
commitment to combating hate and vi-
olence against the Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander community. 
I want to start by offering my condo-
lences, prayers, and support for the 
family and friends of the eight people 
murdered in Atlanta on March 16 and 
the thousands of Asian Americans who 
have been physically or verbally at-
tacked over the course of the pan-
demic. 
The horrific act of gun violence that 
took eight lives in Atlanta, including 
six Asian women, is a tragedy unam-
biguously rooted in hate. It is a trag-
edy that followed 4,000 reported hate 
crimes against Asian Americans over 
the past year, and it is a tragedy that 
followed decades of bigotry, discrimi-
nation, and indifference toward the 
AAPI community. 
We must recognize that physical and 
verbal attacks against people of Asian 
descent are not a new phenomenon and 
that our country has a shameful past of 
violence and discrimination directed 
against Asian Americans. From the 
Chinese Exclusion Act to the intern-
ment of Japanese Americans, to the in-
numerable acts of individual violence 
that have cost so many their lives or 
livelihoods, a vile and persistent rac-
ism has denied many people the basic 
safeties and individual freedoms that 
some others take for granted. 
But we also need to recognize that at 
a time when we are all dealing with the 
hardships caused by the pandemic, 
Asian Americans have had to deal with 
additional pain, fear, and loss brought 
on by the callous and careless rhetoric 
of opportunistic politicians and bigots. 
I have heard from my constituents and 
staff members in my office about the 
pain that the increase in verbal and 
physical attacks has caused through-
out our community. 
b 1515 
I admire the incredible work being 
done by AAPI advocates and organizers 
in 
southeastern 
Pennsylvania 
and 
across the Nation to bring attention to 
anti-Asian discrimination and to call 
for change. Groups in my district, such 
as Asian Americans United, Cambodian 
Association of Greater Philadelphia, 
Laos In The House, VietLead, and oth-
ers across the United States, have mo-
bilized whole communities to come to-
gether and stand firm against hate and 
racism. 
The anti-hate rallies and vigils orga-
nized in response to this year’s shock-
ing attacks are a resounding reminder 
that hate is not welcome in our cities 
and towns, but also that standing up to 
hatred 
requires 
more 
than 
just 
thoughts and prayers. It requires all of 
us to recognize and call out racism 
when we see it, to work with our neigh-
bors to protect everyone in our com-
munities, and to lift up voices that 
aren’t always heard. 
As we continue to confront the sys-
temic racism that plagues so much of 
our culture, the passage of this resolu-
tion by the House must be part of a 
greater holistic effort to provide all 
Americans with prosperity, justice, and 
freedom from fear. 
Congress cannot keep waiting for 
problems to boil over in order to do 
something about them. I ask that all of 
my colleagues keep that in mind as we 
work to address systemic racism and 
the other pressing problems of our day. 
I thank Congresswoman CHU for her 
leadership, and I thank her and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2474 
May 18, 2021 
members of the Georgia delegation for 
introducing this important resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise in sup-
port of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Or-
phan Drug Exclusivity Act. This bill is 
sponsored by my good friend and col-
league from the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, Congresswoman DEAN, 
who has bravely shared her family’s ex-
perience with the hardships caused by 
substance use disorder, and who has 
been a tireless advocate for Federal so-
lutions to the opioid epidemic. 
This much-needed bill would close a 
loophole in our Federal drug approval 
laws, promoting greater competition 
and lower prices and allowing more 
medications to treat opioid use dis-
order, as well as other diseases, to 
come to market. Closing this loophole 
would 
increase 
access 
to 
low-cost 
treatments and would prevent pharma-
ceutical companies from abusing the 
current law to boost drug prices for 
medications that could be sold by com-
petitors at much lower prices. 
In particular, this bill would reduce 
the price of buprenorphine, a drug that 
is critically important for medically 
assisted treatment, or MAT, of opioid 
abuse disorder, but which has been 
made more costly and less available 
due to abuse of the current laws. 
The opioid epidemic has devastated 
families in my district and across the 
country. Too many communities have 
experienced the terrible toll of opioid 
addiction, and I am glad this is an 
issue on which Democrats and Repub-
licans have been able to work together 
and achieve real results for the Amer-
ican people. 
Since 2018, Congress has been able to 
pass multiple bipartisan bills to in-
crease funding for substance use dis-
order, provide more treatments and 
medications for those suffering from 
opioid addiction, and improve access to 
mental health services. 
The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclu-
sivity Act is a straightforward bill 
with bipartisan support and sponsor-
ship that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives last Congress, and it was 
on track to pass this Congress last 
week before inexplicably being derailed 
when 
one 
of 
its 
former 
sponsors 
whipped votes against it. 
I thank my Pennsylvania colleagues, 
Representatives 
DEAN
and 
FITZPATRICK, for their bipartisan lead-
ership on this bill, which is so impor-
tant, not just for Pennsylvanians, but 
for families across this country who 
have struggled to obtain effective and 
affordable treatment for loved ones 
suffering from substance use disorder. I 
urge its prompt passage. 
Lastly, I want to voice my support 
for H. Res. 398, a resolution introduced 
by Congresswoman JACKSON LEE to rec-
ognize the forthcoming centennial of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This 
event was one of the most abhorrent 
instances of racial violence in our Na-
tion’s history, and it is history that we 
should not ignore or forget. 
With this resolution, we can at least 
recognize the people, families, and de-
scendants irreparably harmed that day, 
even if we cannot give them the justice 
they deserved. 
I thank my colleague, Congress-
woman JACKSON LEE, for her work to 
bring this resolution to the floor and to 
ensure that we recognize this terrible 
moment in our collective past. 
I thank all of my colleagues who 
helped craft the bills we are consid-
ering today. I look forward to sup-
porting this rule, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Penn-
sylvania for yielding me the customary 
30 minutes, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
debate the rule governing the consider-
ation of the Fairness in Orphan Drug 
Exclusivity Act and the resolution to 
condemn the horrific shootings in At-
lanta this past March. 
I want to say right away that it is 
not the substance of these two bills to 
which I take exception; it is the proc-
ess the majority is following or not fol-
lowing to move legislation forward. 
The first bill in this rule is H. Res. 
275, a resolution condemning the hor-
rific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, 
this past March. As Members of the 
House of Representatives, we unequivo-
cally 
condemn 
violence 
and 
hate 
against any person or group of people. 
What happened in Atlanta is an un-
imaginable tragedy that must be de-
nounced in no uncertain terms. I sup-
port the idea of the resolution, but not 
the way my colleagues in the majority 
are handling it. 
The majority chose to circumvent 
the prescribed process for a resolution 
of this nature, bypassing the usual 
committee 
markup 
altogether 
and 
sidestepping an opportunity for the 
majority to address concerns from the 
minority and allow the House to speak 
with one unified voice. 
That is not the way the people’s 
House was intended to work, and it 
negatively affects both Members of 
this body and our constituents when we 
can’t have the kind of discussion re-
quired on important pieces of legisla-
tion like this. 
The other underlying bill, H.R. 1629, 
the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclu-
sivity Act, came before the House last 
week and failed to garner the two- 
thirds majority needed to pass on sus-
pension after one of our Republican 
colleagues was left off the bill that he 
had long championed, left off the bill 
for an issue unrelated to the bill. 
Again, I support H.R. 1629 and hope 
you will, too. But not only did the 
Democrats ignore the spirit of biparti-
sanship by which they claim to abide 
and block Republican Members from 
signing on to this bill, they did so by 
continuing to ram through bills with-
out any respect for process, rules, or 
courtesy, which brings me to the ex-
tension of rule changes included in the 
resolution. 
It has been 1 year since this body in-
stituted martial law, as my friend and 
colleague Ranking Member COLE said 
during the Rules Committee hearing 
yesterday. While at the time there was 
certainly a need for changes to the 
rules to rapidly move legislation at the 
onset of the pandemic, the landscape 
has dramatically shifted, and we are 
more than ready to get back to normal. 
Instead, more than 1 year later, we 
are still being governed by martial law 
in what has become the least trans-
parent Congress ever. Democrats in the 
majority continue to chip away at the 
rights of the minority. Before we know 
it, those in the minority will have no 
rights left at all. 
The majority of us in this body are 
fully vaccinated. The science says that 
fully vaccinated individuals can and 
should resume prepandemic behavior. 
So why won’t the Democratic majority 
follow the science and resume regular 
order in this body? 
It is the American people who are 
losing out, and it would behoove the 
Democratic majority to bring the 
time-tested processes and transparency 
back to this institution. 
Madam Speaker, I do support the un-
derlying bills. However, I have serious 
concerns over the continuance of meas-
ures in this rule that limit trans-
parency and strip the minority’s rights 
in this body. It is for this reason that 
I oppose the rule, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, like 
many, I am so excited to see our coun-
try begin to unwind many of the 
COVID–19 precautions of the last year, 
but we are not in the clear yet. 
It is no secret that many Members of 
this body have refused to be vac-
cinated, and many of the same Mem-
bers have also shown repeated dis-
regard for the dangers posed by the 
pandemic. We need to extend certain 
measures in the House to provide the 
House with flexibility to ensure that 
Congress can expeditiously respond to 
the future needs created by the pan-
demic and the economy and to keep all 
of those who serve here safe. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
MATSUI), a former member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the rule providing for consider-
ation of Representative CHU’s resolu-
tion condemning the horrific shootings 
in Atlanta and reaffirming the House’s 
commitment to combating hate and vi-
olence against the AAPI community. 
Earlier 
today, 
I 
joined 
Speaker 
PELOSI, Representatives CHU and MENG, 
and others at an event to mark the im-
portance of the steps we are taking on 
the House floor today. Together, Rep-
resentatives CHU
and MENG’s bills 
make a statement of commitment to a 
sacred American value: celebrating our

diversity as a force against hate and 
discrimination. 
As we honor AAPI Heritage Month, 
we stand amidst a reckoning on racial 
justice and discrimination. We must be 
intentional about how we uplift our 
voices, how we listen, and how we en-
sure dignity and respect throughout 
our communities. 
As the past few years have shown, 
hateful rhetoric can easily spiral into 
scapegoating and violence. Xenophobia 
and blame have proliferated, from the 
highest levels of government to our 
local communities. This cannot be 
overlooked. I have shared my own fam-
ily’s story of the consequences of inac-
tion. 
The fear of ‘‘the other’’ is nothing 
new, but it has been chipping away at 
our social conscience for far too long. 
This is what we are working to root 
out. We must stop it at the source with 
a united front. 
Today’s vote is a reminder that our 
country is capable of growth; that this 
legislative body will not sit in silence 
while a community suffers racism and 
hatred. Future generations are listen-
ing, 
and 
together, 
Americans 
are 
standing up and speaking out. 
It has been encouraging to see the co-
hesion amongst Asian Americans and 
all Americans in the fight against 
AAPI hate. I have been heartened to 
see individuals, leaders, and organiza-
tions come together to help heal our 
communities 
from 
these 
historical 
traumas and move forward united. 
I am proud to support this rule and 
this bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if the issue that the 
majority has with reopening is related 
to vaccinations, I understand the ma-
jority claims that their side is 100 per-
cent vaccinated. I would just say that 
if that is the case, science says they 
have nothing to worry about coming to 
the House floor or being in public. But 
that is not what this is all about. This 
is about the Speaker holding on to her 
slim and tenuous majority by any 
means necessary, even weaponizing the 
House rules to do so. 
If we do defeat the previous question, 
I will offer an amendment to the rule 
to provide for consideration of Rep-
resentative MAST’s H.R. 261, the Pales-
tinian International Terrorism Support 
Prevention Act of 2021. 
I ask unanimous consent to insert 
the text of my amendment in the 
RECORD, along with the extraneous ma-
terials, immediately prior to the vote 
on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
the Israelis are among our greatest al-
lies and a critical strategic partner in 
the international fight against ter-
rorism. 
Congressman 
MAST
under-
stands this better than most. 
H.R. 261 sanctions foreign govern-
ments and persons who provide support 
for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
MAST), who represents the 18th Con-
gressional District. 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Why at this time should we come to-
gether bipartisanly on this vote? That 
is the question that I am going to at-
tempt to answer. 
Members of this body are going to 
have the opportunity as we move for-
ward here to either support Hamas or 
to not, to fight against them. The 
choice will be made. People will decide 
which direction they want to go. 
My bill, H.R. 261, the Palestinian 
International Terrorism Support Pre-
vention Act of 2021, would make clear 
that the United States stands with 
Israel and would sanction those who 
provide financial support to Hamas. It 
is that simple. 
Now, why do we need to do that? Why 
is it important to come together on 
this? To put a fine point on it, this is 
not one pissed-off Palestinian that 
picked up a shoulder-fired RPG, put it 
on their shoulder, and fired it 100 yards 
over at Israel. That is not what we are 
talking about here. 
Hamas is sophisticated. They are 
well organized, and there is a complex 
infrastructure involved in getting them 
their weapons. They don’t just go down 
to the Gaza Strip rocket depot in order 
to pick up these things. They are 
smuggled across Iraq, Syria, Jordan, 
into one of the most densely populated 
areas of the world without anybody no-
ticing or saying anything. That is why 
we need these sanctions. 
b 1530 
Why 
should 
we 
come 
together 
bipartisanly on this to support our 
friend and ally Israel to stand against 
Hamas? 
Because the rockets that Hamas 
smuggles and fires at Israel are not 
science-fair bottle rockets. Many of 
them are Fajr-5 missiles, 21-plus feet 
long. That is longer than a Chevy Sub-
urban. There are hundreds of pounds of 
explosives on the end of that. 
The explosives that detonated under-
neath my legs were about 5 pounds to 
10 pounds of explosives, to put that 
into perspective. 
Why come together bipartisanly to 
support this? 
Because Hamas is not firing these 
rockets in order to make a pretty fire-
works show. They use these missiles 
specifically to target large towns and 
cities with the express hope of killing 
Israeli civilians, like so many that we 
have heard about. 
Ido Avigal was a 5-year-old boy who 
was murdered when shrapnel from a 
rocket ripped through his window in a 
fortified room that he was hiding in 
with his mother. 
Daniel Tragerman was a 4-year-old 
Israeli boy who was killed by a mortar 
shell fired by Hamas in 2014. 
Soumya Santosh was killed when a 
rocket fired on Israel by Hamas on May 
11th 
detonated 
close 
to 
her. 
She 
worked as a caretaker to an elderly 
woman who had been living in Israel 
for the last 7 years. 
These individuals and so many others 
are not just collateral damage. They 
and millions of other Israeli civilians 
are targeted. They are targets of 
Hamas. 
After I was blown up in Afghanistan, 
I volunteered to serve alongside Israel 
Defense Forces. There, I served along-
side soldiers that were driven by their 
love for their fellow man, rather than 
by hatred for their enemies. 
I had the honor of getting to know 
some of the most creative and caring 
people I have ever met, who adapted to 
some of the worst situations that any-
body could be placed into. Every fam-
ily that I encountered during my time 
in Israel shared a desire for their chil-
dren to grow, like we do, and to be edu-
cated 
safely 
without 
the 
looming 
threat of war. 
I learned at the Shabbat tables of my 
hosts there just how much each family 
truly desires peace between every 
neighbor of Israel, regardless of reli-
gion, regardless of history. They don’t 
want to be attacked. They want to live 
in peace. They want to see their chil-
dren grow. 
So why support bipartisanly this leg-
islation? 
Because Hamas, on the other hand, 
uses their own people as shields and 
cannon fodder. They don’t stand for 
their people. They don’t defend their 
people. They stand behind their people. 
They build their command and control 
infrastructure 
inside 
hospitals 
and 
schools. They launch their missiles 
from heavily populated areas. 
And this recent round of fighting be-
tween Hamas and Israel is exactly 
that, a round in an ongoing conflict 
that goes back decades. Hamas has 
consistently launched thousands and 
thousands of rockets into Israel, kill-
ing and maiming hundreds of civilians. 
Why come together bipartisanly? 
Because in the last week alone, they 
have fired more than 3,000 rockets into 
Israel. This didn’t make the news, but 
in April, over 44 rockets fired into 
Israel. In January, three rockets fired 
into Israel. That is just this year. 
Why come together bipartisanly? 
In 2020, more than 130 rocket attacks. 
In 2019, 650 rocket attacks. In 2018, 350 
rocket attacks. 
That is more than one a day. Imagine 
if that was going on here in the United 
States. 
Why come together bipartisanly? 
To make sure that we sanction the 
enablers of Hamas. 
In 2016, Hamas bombed a bus in Jeru-
salem, killing 2 and wounding 21. 
At another time, a Hamas suicide 
bomber killed one and injured nine. 
Another bombing, Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad claims responsibility for a 
suicide bombing in a neighborhood 
bakery.

May 18, 2021 
Another bombing in a shawarma res-
taurant in Tel Aviv killed 11 and 
wounded 70. Palestinian Islamic Jihad 
claimed responsibility, one of the list-
ed sanctioned groups in this bill. 
In another bombing, at a vegetable 
market, seven people killed. Pales-
tinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsi-
bility. 
In another bombing, two commuter 
buses in Beersheba, 16 people killed and 
over 100 wounded. Hamas claimed re-
sponsibility. 
Why is this bill needed? Why do we 
need to come together? 
Because Hamas does not finance ter-
rorism with bake sales. They receive 
significant support from individual 
groups and foreign governments, like 
Iran. 
The U.S. Government has estimated 
that Iran, by itself, has provided as 
much as $100 million annually to 
Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, 
and other Palestinian terrorist organi-
zations. These foreign sponsors seek to 
bring death to the Jewish state. It is 
that simple. 
Under my bill, the United States will 
sanction these groups that are sup-
porting terrorism. If we do not pass 
this bill, we will not stand together to 
sanction these groups that are enabling 
this terrorism. 
This is common sense, which is why 
it passed the House of Representatives 
without any opposition last Congress. 
The bill even includes humanitarian 
exemptions that Democrats in the For-
eign Affairs Committee wrote last Con-
gress, before all voting in favor of this 
piece of legislation. 
Given the ongoing attacks on Israel, 
and the bipartisan support for this bill 
last Congress, I have asked that this 
bill be expedited for consideration 
again. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues are now pushing the opposite 
direction for the United States to with-
hold American weapons shipments to 
Israel, but they will not support steps 
to cut off the flow of weapons and fund-
ing from Iran to Hamas that is killing 
our Israeli friends. There is a false 
equivalency that is going on, and there 
is a rooting for a terrorist organization 
that is happening as well. 
So, Madam Speaker, this is my re-
quest. Many of you supported this bill 
2 years ago. Support it again now. 
Stand with our ally, Israel. Stand 
against Hamas. Stand against their 
enablers. Pass this bill unanimously. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, with all due respect 
to my colleagues, I must respectfully 
decline to chase the red herring that 
has been lobbed onto the House floor. 
A vote on the PQ is strictly a proce-
dural vote to move a bill forward. And 
as our colleagues know, voting ‘‘no’’ 
would simply mean that we would hand 
control of the House floor to them, 
which I decline to do. 
As our colleagues know, they are 
under no obligation to offer any spe-
cific amendment, even if they faith-
fully promise to do so. So let’s not dis-
tract from the bills that we are here to 
move forward today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), the lead sponsor of H. 
Res. 398, recognizing the forthcoming 
centennial of the 1921 Tulsa massacre. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the manager for her leadership. 
I also thank all of those on the floor 
who understand the indignity of mas-
sacres, racism, and devastating his-
tories that our country has faced. 
We, too, are Americans, and I love 
this country. 
Last night, on the floor of the House, 
I said that, as a young girl, I knew 
about the Nina, the Pinta, and the 
Santa Maria; I knew about Columbus 
and 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
and 
George 
Washington. 
And 
that 
was 
well, 
though, obviously, there are challenges 
to that history, even today. That is 
what we knew. But we did not know 
the history—the slave history or even 
the fact that there was something 
called Tulsa, Oklahoma, a bright and 
shining star of economic opportunity. 
This picture shows young girls danc-
ing in a parade, just like today, with 
cowboy hats on, the high school dance 
team, if you will. None of that was 
taught to any of us, this prosperous 
place. 
And then a community known as 
Greenwood, in June of 1921, after a se-
ries of heinous events that nearly en-
tirely destroyed Greenwood. We knew 
nothing about this. A hundred years; 
three living descendants. We will be on 
our way. 
I thank the Congressional Black Cau-
cus for championing this with me, and 
Chairwoman BEATTY for understanding 
the validity of telling the truth. 
In this story, they saw men, women, 
and children driven like cattle, huddled 
like horses, and treated like beasts. I 
saw hundreds—this is a testimony—of 
men march through the main business 
section with their hats off, their hands 
up, with dozens of guards marching 
them with guns and cursing them from 
everything mentionable. Three hun-
dred of them died, and are buried in un-
marked graves. They were murdered. 
The attackers looted and inten-
tionally burned an estimated 1,256 
homes in Greenwood, America’s Black 
Wall Street, along with nearly all of 
the district’s churches, schools, and 
businesses. 
When others began to say, ‘‘Pull 
yourself up by your bootstraps,’’ these 
freed slaves, for barely 100 years, devel-
oped Greenwood. 
Yet this is what happened. This is the 
body of a charred Negro killed in the 
riot. 
How many were like that? 
As I said, the death toll came about 
because something happened in an ele-
vator, a word, something like Emmett 
Till said to a White woman. In a 
firestorm of hatred and violence, that 
is perhaps unequal in peacetime in the 
history of the United States, the White 
mob destroyed almost 40 square blocks, 
left almost 9,000 Greenwood district 
residents homeless. 
So this is a story from 100 years ago. 
Look at the smoke coming from the 
buildings that were industries. People 
had ice cream parlors, restaurants, and 
boarding houses burned to the ground. 
We come today to say, the burned- 
out ruins of Greenwood—there is one 
door left in Tulsa, to be able to em-
brace those from Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
They will be here tomorrow for a hear-
ing in the Judiciary Committee. I am 
honored this legislation will honor 
them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we will know and history will tell us 
that embedded in the annals of the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD will be H. Res. 
398 that talks about that story. 
Yet we rise above that, not so much 
to ignore it, but we ask that we con-
demn the violence in this resolution. 
We ask for rejection and active opposi-
tion to the false ideology of white su-
premacy. We ask for tolerance and 
unity. We ask and are calling upon 
Americans to celebrate ethnic, racial, 
and religious diversity. 
We, too, mourn those who were killed 
in Atlanta for Asian hate. It says, en-
couraging all persons in the United 
States to reflect upon all of our his-
tory. Yes, we can rise above it, but we 
must know that the stories that are 
told say that Tulsa must have some re-
pair, some say reparations. 
Finally, as I close, we hear a testi-
mony from the great-granddaughter of 
Howard and Harriet Ector. They were 
builders and pillars of Black Wall 
Street. They were featured in the 
Smithsonian. As a little girl, their 
great-great-granddaughter was saved 
by hiding in a chicken coop at age 9 to 
dodge bullets. It was a race war. We 
should not ignore our differences, but 
we should be unified by who we are. 
I am delighted to support this resolu-
tion, and I ask my colleagues to vote 
for it. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a report by the Oklahoma 
Commission to Study the Tulsa Race 
Riot of 1921.

SOURCE—TULSA RACE RIOT: A REPORT BY THE 
OKLAHOMA COMMISSION TO STUDY THE TULSA 
RACE RIOT OF 1921, FEB. 28, 2001 
Following World War I, Tulsa, Oklahoma 
was recognized nationally for its affluent Af-
rican American community known as the 
Greenwood District. This thriving business 
district and surrounding residential area was 
referred to as ‘‘Black Wall Street.’’ In June 
1921, a series of heinous events nearly de-
stroyed the entire Greenwood area.

like cattle, huddled like horses and treated 
like beasts. Thus, I fully realized the atti-
tude of the Southern white man when he has

May 18, 2021 
through the main business section of ‘‘White 
Town’’ with their hats off and their hands 
up, with dozens of guards marching them 
with guns, cursing them for everything men-
tionable. I saw large trucks following up the 
invaders, as they ran the colored people from 
their homes and places of business. Every-
thing of value was loaded on these trucks 
and everything left was burned to ashes. I 
saw machine guns turned on the colored men 
to oust them from their stronghold.’’ —Anony-
mous primary source 
Starting late on the evening on May 31 and 
continuing into the day of June 1, 1921, a 
White mob attacked the Greenwood district 
of Tulsa, Oklahoma, razing it to the ground. 
The 
attackers 
looted 
and 
intentionally 
burned an estimated 1,256 homes in Green-
wood—America’s 
‘‘Black 
Wall 
Street’’— 
along with nearly all the district’s churches, 
schools, and businesses. 
The number of persons killed in the riot 
may never be known, but a 2001 report by a 
commission created by the Oklahoma legis-
lature estimated, based on available evi-
dence at that time, that at least 75 to 100 
people died in the Massacre, and found that 
one credible contemporary source estimated 
the death toll at 300 people. All told, in what 
the late historian and Tulsa survivor John 
Hope Franklin described as a ‘‘firestorm of 
hatred and violence that is perhaps un-
equaled in the peace time history of the 
United States,’’ the White mob destroyed al-
most forty-square-blocks and left almost 
9,000 Greenwood district residents homeless. 
As the White invaders moved through the 
district, a violent pattern of murder, looting, 
and arson emerged. Armed Whites would 
force Black residents from their homes or 
businesses where they were held at ‘‘a grow-
ing number of internment centers,’’ loot 
what valuables or furnishings they could 
carry, and then torch the structure. They 
summarily shot any Black men found in a 
home with a firearm as well as anyone else 
who resisted. This pattern was repeated, 
‘‘[h]ouse by house, block after block’’ until 
all of the city’s Black neighborhoods were 
engulfed in flames. 
Whites engaged in the attack also com-
mitted numerous other atrocities. According 
to one Black eyewitness, White looters mur-
dered a Black elderly disabled man who, de-
spite having expressed a willingness to do so, 
could not comply with their order to leave 
his home. According to one White eye-
witness, prominent Black surgeon Dr. A.C. 
Jackson was gunned down on his front lawn 
with his hands up after attempting to com-
ply with the White rioters. Another Black 
eyewitness recounted how he and 30 or 40 
other men who had surrendered to the riot-
ers were lined up and forced to run with 
hands over their heads to an interment cen-
ter located at Convention Hall, all while 
some of their White captors shot at their 
heels with guns. A group of White men even 
ran a car into the group, knocking over two 
or three of their number. In another horri-
fying display of brutality, a Black disabled 
homeless man was tied by his leg to a car 
and dragged by ‘‘white thugs’’ through the 
streets of the downtown business district 
where he panhandled. 
While some might attribute these atroc-
ities to the actions of a few ‘‘rogue’’ officers, 
the ‘‘official’’ police response to the violence 
also appears to have been, at best, mired in 
confusion and, at worst, to have reflected un-
founded racial fears of a so-called ‘‘Negro up-
rising.’’ Responding to the baseless rumors 
that Blacks were coming from outside of 
town, the police chief ordered roughly one- 
fifth of the officers on duty to setup check-
points on various roads leading into the city, 
and at the railroad station, wasting precious 
manpower that could have been used else-
where to prevent the violence and destruc-
tion. 
Following the Massacre, local authorities 
did less than nothing to provide justice for 
the many Black victims. Thousands of Black 
residents remained in internment camps in 
the days immediately following the Mas-
sacre. 
Local officials actively sought to hinder 
the Black community’s rebuilding efforts. 
Within a week of the Massacre, the Tulsa 
City Commission passed a fire ordinance 
aimed at preventing Black Tulsans from re-
building the Greenwood commercial district 
where it originally stood, and the so-called 
Reconstruction Commission established by 
White business and political leaders batted 
away offers of outside aid. Black Tulsans 
successfully challenged the ordinance, which 
was later struck down as unconstitutional by 
the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and managed 
to rebuild at least parts of the community 
where it once stood. Many other Black resi-
dents left homeless or rightfully feeling fear-
ful and unwelcome left Tulsa. Thousands of 
survivors were likely traumatized by the vio-
lence they witnessed or experienced in the 
Massacre. 
The Massacre also destroyed millions of 
dollars in Black-owned property. The 2001 
commission also estimated the property 
damage at 17 million in 1999 dollars, which 
would be more than 25 million today. An-
other source estimates the total value of the 
property destroyed at between 50 and 100 
million in today’s dollars. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the previous ques-
tion and, if defeated, I urge my col-
leagues to adopt H.R. 261 by my friend 
and colleague, Representative BRIAN 
MAST. 
This legislation places strict sanc-
tions on individuals who knowingly aid 
senior members or supporters of ter-
rorist organizations. This legislation, 
moving forward, is important in light 
of the terrorist acts conducted by 
Hamas against the State of Israel. 
These horrific scenes coming out of 
Jerusalem depict countless rockets 
being launched from Gaza with the in-
tent to massacre innocent civilians. 
What we have seen from the Iron 
Dome’s ability to intercept this high 
volume of rockets is really truly re-
markable, 
but 
it 
also 
underscores 
Israel’s security vulnerability. 
We are reminded this past week of 
why the United States must continue 
to be an ally of Israel and why our 
commitment to Israel’s sovereignty 
and independence is so crucial at a 
time of heightened regional hostility. 
Each rocket launched into Israel was 
paid for by a certain group or a certain 
individual, stemming from a vast net-
work of financiers, many from Iran, 
used by these terrorist organizations. 
By punishing those who bankroll 
Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist 
organizations, we are taking an impor-
tant step in providing Israel and the 
Jewish people a bold signal of support 
for their self-defense and their self- 
determination. 
b 1545 
This legislation will help put an end 
to a critical financial component of 
these terrorists by punishing those who 
facilitate 
transactions 
and 
launder 
funds on behalf of those terrorist orga-
nizations. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, I call on you to join our ef-
forts to support our ally Israel. ‘‘Never 
again’’ is a phrase we used to cement 
our determination to protect the Jew-
ish people around the world. At a time 
when terrorists are threatening the ex-
istence of Israel, Democrats should be 
willing to join us at the table for the 
reaffirmation of that commitment. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge unanimous support 
for H. Res. 398, recognizing the 100th 
anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre. As a former history teacher, 
I often quote George Santayana, who 
said, ‘‘Those who cannot remember the 
past are condemned to repeat it.’’ 
The Tulsa Race Massacre is a prime 
example of inflaming issues and ignor-
ing history. They both significantly 
lead to the inability and failure to 
learn the lessons that history can 
teach us. 
It was the inflammatory reporting of 
the chance encounter of a young Black 
man, Dick Rowland, and a young White 
elevator operator, Sarah Page, that ig-
nited one of the deadliest episodes of 
racial violence in our Nation’s history. 
On May 31, 1921, the Tulsa Tribune 
newspaper printed the headline, and I 
am quoting here, ‘‘Nab Negro for At-
tacking Girl in Elevator,’’ and the 
same edition included a report of a 
White mob’s plan to lynch Rowland. 
The newspaper account was based on 
false claims that Mr. Rowland sexually 
assaulted the White woman, and is 
cited as the spark that incited a mob 
to burn and loot 35 blocks in the Black 
Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa and 
kill an estimated 300 people. Green-
wood was known at the time as Black 
Wall Street due to its status as one of 
the most prosperous African-American 
communities in the country. 
The devastation wrought by the mob, 
many of whom had been deputized and 
armed by local officials, took the lives 
and livelihoods of many in the Green-
wood community. It caused irreparable 
damage to so many Black families who 
never received justice for their losses. 
This horrific incident was erased 
from collective memory when the 
Tulsa Tribune destroyed all original 
copies of the May 31, 1921, edition of 
the newspaper and removed all copies 
from their archives. Scholars later dis-
covered that police and State militia 
archives about the riot were missing as 
well. 
We cannot overcome the issues of 
race that have troubled our Nation 
since its inception by ignoring the 
failings of our past. To repair our 
faults, our country must acknowledge 
past mistakes and work to ensure that 
we don’t repeat them.

May 18, 2021 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, the great writer and intellectual 
Carlyle was right, ‘‘No lie can live for-
ever.’’ 
Kill 300 people? No lie can live for-
ever. 
Destroy an entire business district? 
Try to hide it? No lie can live forever. 
Hundreds hospitalized, families de-
stroyed. No lie can live forever. 
One 
hundred 
years 
later, 
truth 
crushed to Earth has arisen, and no lie 
can live forever. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H. Res. 398, the reso-
lution recognizing the forthcoming 
centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre. 
One hundred years ago, the city of 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, was home to the 
Greenwood district, a thriving, pros-
perous community where Black fami-
lies could pursue the American Dream. 
On May 31, 1921, this vibrant commu-
nity was attacked and destroyed by 
white supremacists in one of the worst 
acts of racial violence in American his-
tory. 
But today, Greenwood is rising again. 
H. Res. 398 commemorates the vic-
tims of the Tulsa Race Massacre and 
mourns the loss of Black Wall Street to 
hatred and bigotry. It celebrates the 
strength and perseverance of Black 
Americans, and it calls on all Ameri-
cans to work toward a more perfect 
Union, one that will finally fulfill our 
Nation’s promise of liberty and justice 
for all. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, 100 years ago this month, 
hundreds of Black men, women, and 
children were brutally terrorized, bru-
talized, and murdered in a massacre in 
the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Okla-
homa. Their homes, businesses, and 
churches were burned to the ground. 
Their land was stolen from them. The 
thousands of survivors were locked 
down and deprived of their liberty 
without charges. 
As the 100-year anniversary of the 
Greenwood massacre approaches, it is 
important that we bring a focus to and 
examine this piece of history that has 
been swept under the rug lest we be 
bound to repeat it. 
If the events of January 6 showed us 
anything, it is that we are so close to 
repeating history. That is why I stand 
today in full support of passing H. Res. 
398, a resolution offered by my good 
friend, Congresswoman SHEILA
JACK-
SON LEE, that commemorates in the 
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD
for posterity 
the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race 
Massacre. 
This resolution serves as a reminder 
that Black people in America to this 
day continue to fight to end racist vio-
lence perpetrated against Black people 
in America. 
H. Res. 398 also heralds a Congres-
sional Black Caucus initiative that 
CBC chair JOYCE BEATTY entrusted to 
my friend, Congresswoman BRENDA 
LAWRENCE and I to co-chair; that is, a 
commemorative virtual event which 
will commemorate and examine this 
horrific massacre. The virtual event we 
are hosting will take place on Thurs-
day evening, May 27, at 8 p.m., and is 
entitled, Remembering the Greenwood 
Massacre: 100 Years from Tulsa to the 
Insurrection (Reconciliation, Restora-
tion, and Reparations). 
Again, this virtual event will be held 
on May 27, Thursday, from 8 to 9 p.m. 
This event will be on Zoom, and we are 
encouraging all to attend. It is meant 
to both educate the public about this 
horrific attack on a thriving Black 
community and the massacre of its in-
habitants. It will highlight the rel-
evance and significance of this race- 
based attack, especially as it relates to 
the events of January 6 and the many 
similarities that exist between these 
two events. 
Anyone interested in attending this 
virtual event—and, again, I encourage 
all to do so within the sound of my 
voice—they can go to my website, 
HankJohnson.House.gov to sign up and 
receive the Zoom information. 
It is important that we all partici-
pate in this event, even if it is just by 
listening or hearing from others. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative SHEILA JACKSON LEE for re-
minding us what a difference 100 years 
make. But, you know, 100 years or so 
ago, there was a race riot in Searcy, 
Arkansas. Thousands of African Ameri-
cans were murdered. 
A little more than 100 years ago, 
there was a riot in Chicago, Illinois, 
where hundreds of African Americans 
were injured. But then 100 years ago in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, Black Wall Street, a 
community where people had labored, 
worked hard, seriously put everything 
into it that they could, was destroyed. 
Yet in my town, there is a John Rog-
ers, who is a descendant. His great 
grandfather owned the hotel. 
John Hope Franklin, the great histo-
rian, his relatives were part of that 
massacre and the events surrounding 
it. So Representative SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, thank you for reminding us that 
we can never forget and never go back. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, in 
closing, I just want to reiterate that 
while I do support the idea of the un-
derlying bills, I do not support the way 
the Democrats are running the House. 
The Democratic majority continues 
to move on bills with virtually no 
input from Republicans and continues 
to prioritize partisanship over the 
American people. We are making great 
progress with the pandemic and do not 
need to consider legislation in this 
manner. We have got this rule without 
a semblance of traditional process, and 
one of the resolutions contained in this 
rule was moved to the Rules Com-
mittee without any sort of markup, 
leaving the Members of this body with-
out the means to make amendments or 
lodge their objections. 
That is not the way this body should 
function. I urge the majority to make 
the necessary changes to restore reg-
ular order to the House of Representa-
tives. I do not believe that it is a 
healthy nor respectful way to govern. 
For this reason, I oppose this rule 
and urge my colleagues to oppose it as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1600 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I wanted to mention that Senator 
ELIZABETH WARREN, a native of Okla-
homa, carries the Senate version of H. 
Res. 398 recognizing the Tulsa centen-
nial. 
When I go home and meet with con-
stituents, they want to know what we 
are doing here to make their lives bet-
ter, not whether we have succeeded in 
obstructing the passage of necessary or 
popular legislation or in shutting down 
Congress. I suspect that is true for 
most Members, and I value those with 
whom I can work in good faith. 
This Congress has already seen its 
fair share of parliamentary tricks to 
disrupt the legislative process, and I 
applaud the leadership’s efforts to keep 
Members and staff safe, to advance leg-
islation that will end the pandemic, 
and to serve the American people. 
Let’s be honest about why we are 
taking up floor time to debate and pass 
the orphan drug bill today, a bill with 
broad bipartisan support that passed 
without a single objection last term. 
Last week’s ‘‘no’’ vote by some of our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
was incredibly disrespectful to the 
Americans we are all here to represent. 
Those Members voting ‘‘no’’ effectively 
told their constituents that they care 
more about whose name goes on a bill 
than they care about actually passing 
legislation. 
Like my colleagues, I am frustrated 
that this bill did not pass on suspen-
sion last week. The opioid epidemic is 
a serious issue. Families in my district 
and across the country know firsthand 
the hardships caused by opioid abuse 
and addiction, and this issue deserves 
to be taken seriously and addressed by 
Congress, which is why we are bringing 
this bill back to the floor a week after 
one of its former sponsors blocked its

passage because his feelings were hurt 
when he wasn’t asked to lead the bill 
this term. 
Our colleagues extol, when conven-
ient, the virtues of unity and biparti-
sanship, but it is important for them to 
realize that bipartisanship relies upon 
trust. And in the wake of January 6, 
despite having witnessed the carnage 
created by falsehoods about the elec-
tion results, the majority of our Re-
publican colleagues voted with no evi-
dence to cancel the electoral votes of 
several States. 
For those of us who represent Penn-
sylvania, which was ground zero for 
those falsehoods and the efforts to un-
dermine and overturn our electoral 
process, it is particularly tough to 
trust Members who have shown more 
interest in silencing those who would 
challenge the lies than in defending the 
Constitution. 
It is a shame that a bipartisan bill to 
combat opioid abuse needs to be recon-
sidered under a rule, and I hope this 
time around my colleagues do what is 
right and pass the bill to improve ac-
cess to low-cost medications to combat 
opioid addiction. 
We are here to pass legislation for 
the American people, not to put our 
names on things. Stunts like what we 
saw last week are disrespectful to the 
House, to its Members, and most of all 
to the people we are here to represent. 
I thank all of our colleagues who 
helped craft the bills we are consid-
ering today. I look forward to sup-
porting this rule, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 403 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this

RECOGNIZING THE FORTHCOMING 
CENTENNIAL OF THE 1921 TULSA 
RACE MASSACRE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
403, House Resolution 398 is hereby 
adopted. The text of H. Res. 398 is as 
follows: 
H. RES. 398 
Whereas, in the early 20th century, de jure 
segregation confined Tulsa’s Black residents 
into the ‘‘Greenwood District’’, which they 
built into a thriving community with a na-
tionally renowned entrepreneurial center 
known as the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’; 
Whereas, at the time, White supremacy 
and racist violence were common throughout 
the United States and went largely un-
checked by the justice system; 
Whereas reports of an alleged and disputed 
incident on the morning of May 30, 1921, be-
tween two teenagers, a Black man and a 
White woman, caused the White community 
of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Tribune, to call 
for a lynching amidst a climate of White ra-
cial hostility and White resentment over 
Black economic success; 
Whereas, on May 31, 1921, a mob of armed 
White men descended upon Tulsa’s Green-
wood District and launched what is now 
known as the ‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre’’; 
Whereas Tulsa municipal and county au-
thorities failed to take actions to calm or 
contain the violence, and civil and law en-
forcement officials deputized many White 
men who were participants in the violence as 
their agents, directly contributing to the vi-
olence through overt and often illegal acts; 
Whereas, over a period of 24 hours, the 
White mob’s violence led to the death of an 
estimated 300 Black residents, as well as over 
800 reports of injuries; 
Whereas the White mob looted, damaged, 
burned, or otherwise destroyed approxi-
mately 40 square blocks of the Greenwood 
district, including an estimated 1,256 homes 
of Black residents, as well as virtually every 
other structure, including churches, schools, 
businesses, a hospital, and a library, leaving 
nearly 9,000 Black Tulsans homeless and ef-
fectively wiping out tens of millions of dol-
lars in Black prosperity and wealth in Tulsa; 
Whereas, in the wake of the Tulsa Race 
Massacre, the Governor of Oklahoma de-
clared martial law, and units of the Okla-
homa National Guard participated in the 
mass arrests of all or nearly all of Green-
wood’s surviving residents, removing them 
from Greenwood to other parts of Tulsa and 
unlawfully detaining them in holding cen-
ters; 
Whereas Oklahoma local and State govern-
ments dismissed claims arising from the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre for decades, and the 
event was effectively erased from collective 
memory and history until, in 1997, the Okla-
homa State Legislature finally created a 
commission to study the event; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2001, the commis-
sion issued a report that detailed, for the 
first time, the extent of the Massacre and 
decades-long efforts to suppress its recollec-
tion; 
Whereas none of the law enforcement offi-
cials nor any of the hundreds of other White 
mob members who participated in the vio-
lence were ever prosecuted or held account-
able for the hundreds of lives lost and tens of 
millions of dollars of Black wealth de-
stroyed, despite the Tulsa Race Massacre 
Commission confirming their roles in the 
Massacre, nor was any compensation ever 
provided to the Massacre’s victims or their 
descendants; 
Whereas government and city officials not 
only abdicated their responsibility to rebuild 
and repair the Greenwood community in the 
wake of the violence, but actively blocked 
efforts to do so, contributing to continued 
racial disparities in Tulsa akin to those that 
Black people face across the United States; 
Whereas the pattern of violence against 
Black people in the United States, often at 
the hands of law enforcement, shows that 
the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues; and 
Whereas the year 2021 marks the 100th an-
niversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that the United States 
can achieve a more perfect union—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2482 
May 18, 2021 
(1) by condemning the violence and de-
struction perpetrated against the African- 
American 
community 
of 
Greenwood, 
in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, the scene of the then-larg-
est single instance of domestic terror against 
American citizens; 
(2) through the rejection and active opposi-
tion to the false ideology of White suprem-
acy and condemnation of all groups and or-
ganizations that ascribe to this false system 
of belief and seek to perpetuate their views 
through violence and unlawful conduct; 
(3) by promoting tolerance and unity and 
taking actions to ensure that governmental 
policies and actions do not foster division, 
disharmony, or intolerance; 
(4) by calling upon all Americans to cele-
brate the ethnic, racial, and religious diver-
sity that has made the United States the 
leader of the community of nations and the 
beacon of hope and inspiration to oppressed 
persons everywhere; 
(5) encouraging all persons in the United 
States to reflect upon the history of the 
United States as an imperfect but committed 
journey to establish a more perfect union 
and to cherish and exercise the rights, privi-
leges, and responsibilities guaranteed by the 
Constitution; and 
(6) recognizes the commitment of Congress 
to acknowledge and learn from the history of 
racism and racial violence in the United 
States, including the Tulsa Race Massacre, 
to reverse the legacy of White supremacy 
and fight for racial justice.

MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES 
AND PASS CERTAIN BILLS 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to section 5 of House Resolution 403, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 144, H.R. 204, H.R. 210, H.R. 240, 
H.R. 707, H.R. 711, H.R. 1157, H.R. 1447,

and H.R. 3008. 
The Clerk read the title of the bills. 
The text of the bills are as follows: 
SUPPORTING EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS ACT 
H.R. 144 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supporting 
Early-Career Researchers Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Nation’s universities and industrial 
research labs are facing unprecedented budg-
et pressure as part of the COVID–19 health 
crisis, resulting in considerably fewer open-
ings for research and teaching positions. 
(2) Emergency funding is needed to fore-
stall the loss of research talent likely to 
occur if early-career researchers are forced 
to seek employment outside of research due 
to the sharp economic decline caused by the 
COVID–19 health crisis. 
(3) The future of America’s defense will 
rely on advanced technologies to maintain 
its military superiority over its rivals, in-
cluding China. These technologies will re-
quire new levels of scientific and engineering 
aptitude and understanding. Early career re-
searchers will play a critical role in the de-
velopment of these technologies, and the loss 
of an entire generation of researchers due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic will be detrimental 
to the United States national security. 
SEC. 3. EARLY-CAREER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 
PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the Na-
tional Science Foundation may establish a 2- 
year pilot program to award grants to highly 
qualified early-career investigators to carry 
out an independent research program at the 
qualified institution of higher education cho-
sen by such investigator, to last for a period 
not greater than 2 years. 
(b) SELECTION PROCESS.—The Director of 
the National Science Foundation shall select 
grantees under subsection (a) from among 
citizens, nationals, and lawfully admitted 
permanent resident aliens of the United 
States. 
(c) OUTREACH.—The Director shall conduct 
program outreach to recruit fellowship ap-
plicants— 
(1) from all regions of the country; 
(2) from historically underrepresented pop-
ulations in the fields of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics; and 
(3) who graduate from or intend to carry 
out research at a variety of types of institu-
tions of higher education, including— 
(A) Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities; 
(B) Hispanic-Serving Institutions; 
(C) Tribal Colleges and Universities; and 
(D) institutions of higher education that 
are not among the top 50 institutions in an-
nual Federal funding for research. 
(d) SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.—The Director 
shall give special consideration to an appli-
cation from an individual who graduated 
from or is intending to carry out research at 
an institution of the type listed in sub-
section (c)(3). 
(e) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after 
the conclusion of the second year of the pilot 
program, the Director shall submit a report 
to Congress that includes— 
(1) statistical summary data on fellowship 
awardees disaggregated by race, ethnicity, 
gender, age, years since completion of doc-
toral degree, and institution type; 
(2) an assessment, drawing on feedback 
from the research community and other 
sources of information, of the effectiveness 
of the pilot program for mitigating the loss 
of research talent due to the pandemic; and 
(3) if determined effective, a plan for per-
manent implementation of the pilot pro-
gram. 
(f) QUALIFIED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDU-
CATION DEFINED.—The term ‘‘qualified insti-
tution of higher education’’ has the meaning 
given the term in section 102 of the Higher 
Education of Act of 1965, except that such 
term does not include an institution de-
scribed in subsection (a)(1)(C) of such sec-
tion. 
SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There is authorized to be appropriated to 
the Director of the National Science Founda-
tion $250,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2022 to carry out the activities in 
this Act. 
STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACT 
H.R. 204 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; 
FINDINGS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘STEM Opportunities Act’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; find-
ings. 
Sec. 2. Purposes. 
Sec. 3. Federal science agency policies for 
caregivers. 
Sec. 4. Collection and reporting of data on 
Federal research grants. 
Sec. 5. Policies for review of Federal re-
search grants. 
Sec. 6. Collection of data on demographics 
of faculty. 
Sec. 7. Cultural and institutional barriers to 
expanding the academic and 
Federal STEM workforce. 
Sec. 8. Research and dissemination at the 
National Science Foundation. 
Sec. 9. Research and related activities to ex-
pand STEM opportunities.

and 
Universities 
Program. 
Sec. 11. Report to Congress. 
Sec. 12. Merit review. 
Sec. 13. Determination of budgetary effects. 
Sec. 14. Definitions. 
(c) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) Many reports over the past decade have 
found that it is critical to our Nation’s eco-
nomic leadership and global competitiveness 
that the United States educates and trains 
more scientists and engineers. 
(2) Research shows that women and mi-
norities who are interested in STEM careers 
are disproportionately lost at nearly every 
educational transition and at every career 
milestone. 
(3) The National Center for Science and 
Engineering 
Statistics 
at 
the 
National 
Science Foundation collects, compiles, ana-
lyzes, and publishes data on the demo-
graphics of STEM degrees and STEM jobs in 
the United States. 
(4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of 
all STEM bachelor’s degrees, but major vari-
ations persist among fields. In 2017, women 
earned only 20 percent of all bachelor’s de-
grees awarded in engineering and 19 percent 
of bachelor’s degrees awarded in computer 
sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics data, jobs in computing occupations are 
expected to account for nearly 60 percent of 
the projected annual growth of newly cre-
ated STEM job openings from 2016 to 2026. 
(5) In 2017, underrepresented minority 
groups comprised 39 percent of the college- 
age population of the United States, but only 
18 percent of students who earned bachelor’s 
degrees in STEM fields. The Higher Edu-
cation Research Institute at the University 
of California, Los Angeles, found that, while 
freshmen from underrepresented minority 
groups express an interest in pursuing a 
STEM undergraduate degree at the same 
rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent 
of Latino students, 18.4 percent of African- 
American students, and 18.8 percent of Na-
tive American students studying in STEM 
fields complete their degree within 5 years, 
compared to approximately 33 percent of 
White students and 42 percent of Asian stu-
dents who complete their degree within 5 
years. 
(6) In some STEM fields, including the 
computer sciences, women persist at about 
the same rate through doctorate degrees. In 
other STEM fields, women persist through 
doctorate degrees at a lower rate. In mathe-
matics, women earn just 26 percent of doc-
torate degrees compared with 42 percent of 
undergraduate 
degrees. 
Overall, 
women 
earned 38 percent of STEM doctorate degrees 
in 2016. The rate of minority students earn-
ing STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9 
percent, compared with 15 percent for bach-
elor’s 
degree. 
Students 
from 
underrep-
resented minority groups accounted for only 
11.5 percent of STEM doctorate degrees 
awarded in 2016. 
(7) The representation of women in STEM 
drops significantly from the doctorate de-
gree level to the faculty level. Overall, 
women hold only 26 percent of all tenured 
and tenure-track positions and 27 percent of 
full professor positions in STEM fields in our 
Nation’s universities and 4-year colleges. 
Black and Hispanic faculty together hold 
about 6.8 percent of all tenured and tenure- 
track positions and 7.5 percent of full pro-
fessor positions. Many of the numbers in the

American Indian or Alaskan Native and Na-
tive Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander cat-
egories for different faculty ranks were too 
small for the National Science Foundation 
to report publicly without potentially com-
promising confidential information about 
the individuals being surveyed. 
(8) The representation of women is espe-
cially low at our Nation’s top research uni-
versities. Even in the biological sciences, in 
which women now earn more than 50 percent 
of the doctorates and passed the 25 percent 
level 37 years ago, women make up only 25 
percent of the full professors at the approxi-
mately 100 most research-intensive univer-
sities in the United States. In the physical 
sciences and mathematics, women make up 
only 11 percent of full professors, in com-
puter sciences only 10 percent, and across en-
gineering fields only 7 percent. The data sug-
gest that approximately 6 percent of all ten-
ure-track STEM faculty members at the 
most 
research-intensive 
universities 
are 
from underrepresented minority groups, but 
in some fields the numbers are too small to 
report publicly. 
(9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities 
will comprise 52 percent of the college-age 
population of the United States. If the per-
centage of female students and students 
from underrepresented minority groups earn-
ing bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields does 
not significantly increase, the United States 
will face an acute shortfall in the overall 
number of students who earn degrees in 
STEM fields just as United States companies 
are increasingly seeking students with those 
skills. With this impending shortfall, the 
United States will almost certainly lose its 
competitive edge in the 21st century global 
economy. 
(10) According to a 2014 Association for 
Women in Science survey of over 4,000 sci-
entists across the globe, 70 percent of whom 
were men, STEM researchers face significant 
challenges in work-life integration. Re-
searchers in the United States were among 
the most likely to experience a conflict be-
tween work and their personal life at least 
weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed 
said that ensuring good work-life integration 
has negatively impacted their careers, and, 
of researchers intending to leave their cur-
rent job within the next year, 9 percent indi-
cated it was because they were unable to bal-
ance work and life demands. 
(11) Female students and students from 
underrepresented minority groups at institu-
tions of higher education who see few others 
‘‘like themselves’’ among faculty and stu-
dent populations often do not experience the 
social integration that is necessary for suc-
cess in all disciplines, including STEM. 
(12) One in five children in the United 
States attend school in a rural community. 
The data shows that rural students are at a 
disadvantage with respect to STEM readi-
ness. Among STEM-interested students, 17 
percent of students in rural high schools and 
18 percent of students in town-located high 
schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark, 
compared with 33 percent of students in sub-
urban high schools and 27 percent of students 
in urban high schools. 
(13) A substantial body of evidence estab-
lishes that most people hold implicit biases. 
Decades of cognitive psychology research re-
veal that most people carry prejudices of 
which they are unaware but that nonetheless 
play a large role in evaluations of people and 
their work. Unintentional biases and out-
moded institutional structures are hindering 
the access and advancement of women, mi-
norities, and other groups historically under-
represented in STEM. 
(14) Workshops held to educate faculty 
about 
unintentional 
biases 
have 
dem-
onstrated success in raising awareness of 
such biases. 
(15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (in this 
Act referred to as ‘‘NASA’’) completed a re-
port that— 
(A) is specifically designed to help NASA 
grant recipients identify why the dearth of 
women in STEM fields continues and to en-
sure that it is not due to discrimination; and 
(B) provides guidance that is usable by all 
institutions of higher education receiving 
significant Federal research funding on how 
to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of 
campus culture and policies. 
(16) The Federal Government provides 55 
percent of research funding at institutions of 
higher education and, through its grant- 
making policies, has had significant influ-
ence on institution of higher education poli-
cies, including policies related to institu-
tional culture and structure. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
The purposes of this Act are as follows: 
(1) To ensure that Federal science agencies 
and institutions of higher education receiv-
ing Federal research and development fund-
ing are fully engaging the entire talent pool 
of the United States. 
(2) To promote research on, and increase 
understanding of, the participation and tra-
jectories of women, minorities, and other 
groups 
historically 
underrepresented 
in 
STEM studies and careers, including persons 
with disabilities, older learners, veterans, 
and rural, poor, and tribal populations, at in-
stitutions of higher education and Federal 
science agencies, including Federal labora-
tories. 
(3) To raise awareness within Federal 
science agencies, including Federal labora-
tories, and institutions of higher education 
about cultural and institutional barriers 
limiting the recruitment, retention, pro-
motion, and other indicators of participation 
and achievement of women, minorities, and 
other groups historically underrepresented 
in academic and Government STEM research 
careers at all levels. 
(4) To identify, disseminate, and imple-
ment best practices at Federal science agen-
cies, including Federal laboratories, and at 
institutions of higher education to remove or 
reduce cultural and institutional barriers 
limiting the recruitment, retention, and suc-
cess of women, minorities, and other groups 
historically underrepresented in academic 
and Government STEM research careers.

RURAL STEM EDUCATION RESEARCH ACT 
H.R. 210 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rural STEM 
Education Research Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The supply of STEM workers is not 
keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs 
of the public and private sector, resulting in 
a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills 
shortage. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need one mil-
lion additional STEM professionals than it is 
on track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
wages, more opportunities for advancement, 
and a higher degree of job security than non- 
STEM jobs. 
(4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United 
States who live in rural settings are signifi-
cantly under-represented in STEM. 
(5) According to the National Center for 
Education Statistics, nine million students 
in the United States—nearly 20 percent of 
the total K–12 population—attend rural 
schools, and for reasons ranging from teach-
er quality to shortages of resources, these 
students often have fewer opportunities for 
high-quality STEM learning than their peers 
in the Nation’s urban and suburban schools. 
(6) Rural areas represent one of the most 
promising, yet underutilized, opportunities 
for STEM education to impact workforce de-
velopment and regional innovation, includ-
ing agriculture. 
(7) The study of agriculture, food, and nat-
ural resources involves biology, engineering, 
physics, chemistry, math, geology, computer 
science, and other scientific fields. 
(8) Employment in computer and informa-
tion technology occupations is projected to 
grow 11 percent from 2019 to 2029. To help 
meet this demand, it is important rural stu-
dents have the opportunity to acquire com-
puting skills through exposure to computer 
science learning in grades Pre-K through 12 
and in informal learning settings. 
(9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the 
United States use high-speed broadband to 
work, learn, access healthcare, and operate 
their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals 
in the United States still lack access to 
high-speed broadband. Rural areas are hard-
est hit, with over 26 percent of individuals in 
rural areas in the United States lacking ac-
cess to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 
percent of individuals in urban areas in the 
United States. 
SEC. 3. NIST ENGAGEMENT WITH RURAL COMMU-
NITIES.

GHOST ARMY CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
H.R. 707 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ghost Army 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
comprised of the 23d Headquarters and Head-
quarters Company, Special Troops, the 603d 
Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th 
Combat Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal 
Service Company and the Signal Company, 
Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops 
and the 3133d Signal Service Company were 
top-secret units of the United States Army 
that served in Europe during World War II. 
(2) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
was actively engaged in battlefield oper-
ations from June of 1944 through March of 
1945. The 3133d Signal Service Company was 
engaged in operations in Italy in 1945. 
(3) The deceptive activities of these units 
were integral to several Allied victories 
across Europe and reduced American casual-
ties. 
(4) In evaluating the performance of these 
units after the War, a U.S. Army analysis 
found that ‘‘Rarely, if ever, has there been a 
group of such a few men which had so great 
an influence on the outcome of a major mili-
tary campaign.’’. 
(5) Many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen- 
soldiers recruited from art schools, adver-
tising agencies, communications companies, 
and other creative and technical professions. 
(6) The first four members of the 23d Head-
quarters, Special Troops, landed on D-Day 
and two became casualties while creating 
false beach landing sites. 
(7) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
secret deception operations commenced in 
France on June 14, 1944, when Task Force 
Mason, a 17-man detachment of the 23d led 
by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, landed 
at Omaha Beach. Task Force Mason con-
ducted Operation ELEPHANT between 1 and 
4 July, 1944, to draw enemy fire and protect 
the 980th Field Artillery Battalion (VIII 
Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign. 
(8) Operation ELEPHANT was a prelude to 
21 full-scale tactical deceptions completed by 
the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops. 
(9) Often operating on or near the front 
lines, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
used inflatable tanks, artillery, airplanes 
and other vehicles, advanced engineered 
soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio 
trickery to create the illusion of sizable 
American forces where there were none and 
to draw the enemy away from Allied troops. 
(10) The 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service 
Companies, activated in Pine Camp (now 
Fort Drum), New York, at the Army Experi-
mental Station in March 1944, were the only 
two active duty ‘‘sonic deception’’ ground 
combat units in World War II. 
(11) Soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Spe-
cial 
Troops, 
impersonated 
other, 
larger 
Army units by sewing counterfeit patches 
onto their uniforms, painting false markings 
on their vehicles, and creating phony head-
quarters staffed by fake generals, all in an 
effort to feed false information to Axis spies. 
(12) During the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
Headquarters, Special Troops, created coun-
terfeit radio traffic to mask the efforts of 
General George Patton’s Third Army as it 
mobilized to break through to the 101st Air-
borne and elements of 10th Armored Division 
in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne. 
(13) 
In 
its 
final 
mission, 
Operation 
VIERSEN, in March 1945, the 23d Head-
quarters, Special Troops, conducted a tac-
tical deception that drew German units down 
the Rhine River and away from the Ninth 
Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross the 
Rhine into Germany. On this mission, the 
1,100 men of the Ghost Army, with the assist-
ance of other units, impersonated forty thou-
sand men, or two complete divisions of 
American forces, by using fabricated radio 
networks, soundtracks of construction work 
and artillery fire, and more than 600 inflat-
able vehicles. According to a military intel-
ligence officer of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is 
no doubt that Operation VIERSEN materi-
ally assisted in deceiving the enemy with re-
gard to the real dispositions and intentions 
of this Army.’’. 
(14) Three soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops, gave their lives and dozens 
were injured in carrying out their mission. 
(15) In April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
Company conducted Operation CRAFTSMAN 
in support of Operation SECOND WIND, the 
successful allied effort to break through the 
German defensive position to the north of 
Florence, Italy, known as the Gothic Line. 
Along with an attached platoon of British 
engineers, who were inflatable decoy special-
ists, the 3133d Signal Service Company used 
sonic deception to misrepresent troop loca-
tions along this defensive line.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2490 
May 18, 2021 
(16) The activities of the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company remained highly classified for 
more than forty years after the war and were 
never formally recognized. The extraor-
dinary accomplishments of this unit are de-
serving of belated official recognition. 
(17) The United States is eternally grateful 
to the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Spe-
cial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company for their proficient use of innova-
tive tactics throughout World War II, which 
saved lives and made significant contribu-
tions to the defeat of the Axis powers. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make

propriate design to the 23d Headquarters, 
Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company, known as the ‘‘Ghost Army’’, col-
lectively, in recognition of its unique and in-
credible service during World War II. 
(b) DESIGN
AND STRIKING.—For the pur-
poses of the award referred to in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (in this 
Act referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall 
strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, 
devices, and inscriptions, to be determined 
by the Secretary. 
(c) SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Following the award of 
the gold medal in honor of the Ghost Army, 
the gold medal shall be given to the Smith-
sonian Institution, where it will be available 
for display as appropriate and available for 
research. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
the Congress that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion should make the gold medal awarded 
pursuant to this Act available for display 
elsewhere, particularly at appropriate loca-
tions associated with the Ghost Army, and 
that preference should be given to locations 
affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
The Secretary may strike and sell dupli-
cates in bronze of the gold medal struck 
under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover 
the costs of the medal, including labor, ma-
terials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead 
expenses. 
SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDAL. 
The gold medal struck pursuant to this 
Act is a national medal for purposes of chap-
ter 51 of title 31, United States Code. 
SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

TITLE 
I—ORGANIZATION 
AND 
OPER-
ATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
SEC. 1001. DIPLOMATIC PROGRAMS. 
For ‘‘Diplomatic Programs’’, there is au-
thorized to be appropriated $9,170,013,000 for 
fiscal year 2022. 
SEC. 1002. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE 
OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE’S WORK. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) United States global engagement is key 
to a stable and prosperous world; 
(2) United States leadership is indispen-
sable in light of the many complex and inter-
connected threats facing the United States 
and the world; 
(3) diplomacy and development are critical 
tools of national power, and full deployment 
of these tools is vital to United States na-
tional security; 
(4) challenges such as the global refugee 
and migration crises, terrorism, historic 
famine and food insecurity, and fragile or re-
pressive societies cannot be addressed with-
out sustained and robust United States dip-
lomatic and development leadership; 
(5) the United States Government must use 
all of the instruments of national security 
and foreign policy at its disposal to protect 
United 
States 
citizens, 
promote 
United 
States interests and values, and support 
global stability and prosperity; 
(6) United States security and prosperity 
depend on having partners and allies that 
share our interests and values, and these 
partnerships are nurtured and our shared in-
terests and values are promoted through 
United States diplomatic engagement, secu-
rity cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
assistance that helps further economic de-
velopment, good governance, including the 
rule of law and democratic institutions, and 
the development of shared responses to nat-
ural and humanitarian disasters; 
(7) as the United States Government agen-
cies primarily charged with conducting di-
plomacy and development, the Department 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) require sus-
tained and robust funding to carry out this 
important work, which is essential to our 
ability to project United States leadership 
and values and to advance United States in-
terests around the world; 
(8) the work of the Department and USAID 
makes the United States and the world safer 
and more prosperous by alleviating global 
poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and 
other infectious diseases, strengthening alli-
ances, expanding educational opportunities 
for women and girls, promoting good govern-
ance and democracy, supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts, driving economic development 
and trade, preventing armed conflicts and 
humanitarian crises, and creating American 
jobs and export opportunities; 
(9) the Department and USAID are vital 
national security agencies, whose work is 
critical to the projection of United States 
power and leadership worldwide, and without 
which Americans would be less safe, United 
States economic power would be diminished, 
and global stability and prosperity would 
suffer; 
(10) investing in diplomacy and develop-
ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and 
(11) the contributions of personnel working 
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United 
States to maintain its leadership around the 
world. 
SEC. 1003. BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND LABOR.

SEC. 1008. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
TRAINING TO NATIONAL SECURITY. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that—

eign and Civil Service, require the best pos-
sible training at every stage of their careers 
to prepare them to promote and defend 
United States national interests and the 
health and safety of United States citizens 
abroad; 
(2) the Department of State’s investment 
of time and resources with respect to the 
training and education of its personnel is 
considerably below the level of other Federal 
departments and agencies in the national se-
curity field, and falls well below the invest-
ments many allied and adversarial countries 
make in the development of their diplomats; 
(3) the Department faces increasingly com-
plex and rapidly evolving challenges, many 
of which are science and technology-driven, 
and which demand the continual, high-qual-
ity training and education of its personnel; 
(4) the Department must move beyond reli-
ance on ‘‘on-the-job training’’ and other in-
formal mentorship practices, which lead to 
an inequality in skillset development and ca-
reer advancement opportunities, often par-
ticularly for minority personnel, and to-
wards a robust professional tradecraft train-
ing continuum that will provide for greater 
equality in career advancement and increase 
minority participation in the senior ranks;

(5) the Department’s Foreign Service Insti-
tute and other training facilities should seek 
to substantially increase its educational and 
training offerings to Department personnel, 
including developing new and innovative 
educational and training courses, methods, 
programs, and opportunities; and 
(6) consistent with existing Department 
gift acceptance authority and other applica-
ble laws, the Department and Foreign Serv-
ice Institute may accept funds and other re-
sources from foundations, not-for-profit cor-
porations, and other appropriate sources to 
help the Department and the Institute en-
hance the quantity and quality of training 
offerings, especially in the introduction of 
new, innovative, and pilot model courses. 
(b) TRAINING
FLOAT.—Not later than 90 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of State shall develop and 
submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a strategy to establish a ‘‘train-
ing float’’ to allow for up to 15 percent of the 
Civil and Foreign Service to participate in 
long-term training at any given time. The 
strategy should identify steps necessary to 
ensure implementation of the training prior-
ities identified in subsection (c), sufficient 
training capacity and opportunities are 
available to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers, equitable distribution of long-term 
training opportunities to Civil and Foreign 
Service officers, and any additional re-
sources or authorities necessary to facilitate 
such a training float, including programs at 
the George P. Schultz National Foreign Af-
fairs Training Center, the Foreign Service 
Institute, 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Security 
Training Center, and other facilities or pro-
grams operated by the Department of State. 
The strategy shall identify which types of 
training would be prioritized, the extent (if 
any) to which such training is already being 
provided to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers by the Department of State, any factors 
incentivizing or disincentivizing such train-
ing, and why such training cannot be 
achieved without Civil and Foreign Service 
officers leaving the workforce. In addition to 
training opportunities provided by the De-
partment, the strategy shall consider train-
ing that could be provided by the other 
United States Government training institu-
tions, as well as non-governmental edu-
cational institutions. The strategy shall con-
sider approaches to overcome disincentives 
to pursuing long-term training. 
(c) PRIORITIZATION.—In order to provide the 
Civil and Foreign Service with the level of 
education and training needed to effectively 
advance United States interests across the 
globe, the Department of State should— 
(1) increase its offerings— 
(A) of virtual instruction to make training 
more 
accessible 
to 
personnel 
deployed 
throughout the world; or 
(B) at partner organizations to provide use-
ful outside perspectives to Department per-
sonnel; 
(2) offer courses utilizing computer-based 
or assisted simulations, allowing civilian of-
ficers to lead decision-making in a crisis en-
vironment; and 
(3) consider increasing the duration and ex-
panding 
the 
focus 
of 
certain 
training 
courses, including— 
(A) the A-100 orientation course for For-
eign Service officers, and 
(B) the chief of mission course to more ac-
curately reflect the significant responsibil-
ities accompanying such role. 
(d) 
OTHER
AGENCY
RESPONSIBILITIES.— 
Other national security agencies should in-
crease the enrollment of their personnel in 
courses at the Foreign Service Institute and 
other Department of State training facilities 
to promote a whole-of-government approach 
to mitigating national security challenges. 
SEC. 1009. CLASSIFICATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF

ed by adding at the end the following new

sure that any employee subjected to an as-
signment restriction or preclusion shall have

tims, about the causes and consequences of

ment, including, as appropriate, requiring

condoning public corruption, including the 
investigation, prosecution, and conviction of 
such officials;

fluences, inducements, pressures, threats, or 
interferences, whether direct or indirect,

works and in other cooperative efforts to 
combat serious, significant corruption, in-
cluding cooperating with the governments of 
other countries to extradite corrupt actors;

lic corruption, ensures their access to jus-
tice, and takes steps to prevent such victims 
from being further victimized or persecuted 
by corrupt actors, government officials, or 
others; and

victims of public corruption or whistle-
blowers due to such persons having assisted

MSI STEM ACHIEVEMENT ACT 
H.R. 2027 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘MSI STEM 
Achievement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Evidence suggests that the supply of 
STEM workers is not keeping pace with the 
rapidly evolving needs of the public and pri-
vate sector, resulting in a deficit often re-
ferred to as a STEM skills shortage. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need one mil-
lion additional STEM professionals than it is 
on track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, 
more opportunities for advancement, and a 
higher degree of job security than non-STEM 
occupations. 
(4) The composition of the STEM work-
force does not reflect the current or pro-
jected diversity of the Nation, with His-
panics, African Americans, and other racial 
and ethnic minorities, significantly under-
represented in the STEM workforce com-
pared to their presence in the workforce 
more generally. 
(5) A stronger national commitment to in-
creasing the diversity of the STEM work-
force is needed to help address the STEM 
skills shortage. 
(6) According to a 2019 National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine re-
port entitled ‘‘Minority Serving Institutions: 
America’s 
Underutilized 
Resource 
for 
Strengthening the STEM Workforce’’, 2- and 
4-year minority serving institutions enroll 
nearly 30 percent of all undergraduate stu-
dents—a percentage that is expected to grow 
in the coming years—in the United States 
higher education system and play a critical 
role in providing important pathways to 
STEM-related education, training, and ca-
reers for students of color. 
(7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly suc-
cessful at educating underrepresented minor-
ity students in STEM fields and can serve as 
best practice models for other colleges and 
universities to further expand participation 
of underrepresented minorities in the STEM 
workforce. 
(8) Increased investment in STEM infra-
structure at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs has the 
potential to increase these institutions’ abil-
ity to educate even more students in the 
STEM disciplines. 
(9) With the demand for STEM skills ex-
ceeding the supply of STEM graduates, suc-
cess of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in educating 
and training science and engineering leaders 
is increasingly important for United States 
economic growth and competitiveness. 
SEC. 3. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 
REVIEW. 
Not later than 3 years after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Comptroller General 
of the United States shall report to Con-
gress— 
(1) an inventory of competitive funding 
programs and initiatives carried out by Fed-
eral science agencies that are targeted to 
HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs or partnerships with 
HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs; 
(2) an assessment of Federal science agen-
cy outreach activities to increase the par-
ticipation and competitiveness of HBCUs, 
TCUs, and MSIs in the funding programs and 
initiatives identified in paragraph (1); and 
(3) recommendations of the Comptroller 
General to increase the participation of and 
the rate of success of HBCUs, TCUs, and 
MSIs in competitive funding programs of-
fered by Federal science agencies.

NATIONAL ESTUARIES AND ACIDIFICATION 
RESEARCH ACT OF 2021 
H.R. 2533 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Es-
tuaries and Acidification Research Act of 
2021’’ or the ‘‘NEAR Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Ocean acidification impacts human 
health, natural resources, and the environ-
mental, economic, and recreational uses of 
the coastline. 
(2) The current understanding of ocean 
acidification 
impacts 
on 
estuarine 
eco-
systems is inadequate to fully prepare and 
manage for changing environmental condi-
tions in nearshore locations. 
(3) While pH can be measured with high 
precision and accuracy in open ocean envi-
ronments, more understanding of the car-
bonate system in estuarine ecosystems is 
needed for precise and accurate measure-
ments and observations. 
(4) The interaction of multiple stressors, 
including salinity, pH, temperature, sea 
level rise, and nutrient input, within estua-
rine ecosystems is inadequately understood 
for managing the health, economic, rec-
reational, and environmental impacts driven 
by these interactions. 
(5) A better understanding is needed of how 
anthropogenic influences in coastal environ-
ments affect estuarine ecosystems. 
(6) More integration and coordination is 
needed among regional, national, and global 
environmental observations in estuarine en-
vironments, supporting prior investments in 
related topics such as nutrient loading, hy-
poxia, ocean acidification, and harmful algae 
bloom research and observational systems. 
SEC. 3. STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF 
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND OTHER 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
STRESSORS 
ON 
ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Commerce shall make appro-
priate arrangements with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘National 
Academies’’) under which the National Acad-
emies shall conduct a study that— 
(1) examines the existing science of ocean 
acidification in estuarine environments; 
(2) examines the challenges to studying 
ocean acidification and ocean acidification’s 
interactions 
with 
other 
environment 
stressors in estuarine environments; 
(3) provides recommendations for improv-
ing future research with respect to ocean 
acidification in estuarine environments; and 
(4) identifies pathways for applying science 
in management and mitigation decisions re-
lating to ocean acidification in estuarine en-
vironments. 
(b) CONTENTS
OF STUDY.—The study de-
scribed under subsection (a) shall include— 
(1) the behavior of the carbonate system 
within estuarine environments; 
(2) the interactions of the carbonate sys-
tem with other biotic and abiotic character-
istics of estuarine ecosystems; 
(3) how environmental and anthropogenic 
changes or disturbances could affect abiotic 
and biotic processes within estuaries; 
(4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic proc-
esses will be affected under predicted envi-
ronmental changes; 
(5) the current state of data collection, in-
terpretation, storage, and retrieval and ob-
servational infrastructure of abiotic and bi-
otic parameters in estuarine ecosystems;

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the 
‘‘Combating 
Sexual 
Harassment 
in 
Science Act’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows:

Sec. 5. Data collection. 
Sec. 6. Responsible conduct guide. 
Sec. 7. Interagency working group. 
Sec. 8. National academies assessment. 
Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) According to the report issued by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual 
Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and 
Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine’’— 
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in insti-
tutions of higher education; 
(B) the most common type of sexual har-
assment is gender harassment, which in-
cludes verbal and nonverbal behaviors that 
convey insulting, hostile, and degrading atti-
tudes about members of one gender; 
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the aca-
demic workplace experience sexual harass-
ment, the second highest rate when com-
pared to the military, the private sector, and 
Federal, State, and local government; 
(D) women who are members of racial or 
ethnic minority groups are more likely to 
experience sexual harassment and to feel un-
safe at work than White women, White men, 
or men who are members of such groups; 
(E) the training for each individual who 
has a doctor of philosophy in the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
fields is estimated to cost approximately 
$500,000; and 
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
(2) Sexual harassment undermines career 
advancement for women. 
(3) According to a 2017 University of Illi-
nois study, among astronomers and plan-
etary scientists, 18 percent of women who 
are members of racial or ethnic minority 
groups and 12 percent of White women 
skipped professional events because they did 
not feel safe attending. 
(4) Many women report leaving employ-
ment at institutions of higher education due 
to sexual harassment. 
(5) Research shows the majority of individ-
uals do not formally report experiences of 
sexual harassment due to a justified fear of 
retaliation or other negative professional or 
personal consequences. 
(6) Reporting procedures with respect to 
such harassment are inconsistent among

CONDEMNING 
THE 
HORRIFIC 
SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA, GEOR-
GIA, ON MARCH 16, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to 
House Resolution 403, I call up the res-
olution (H. Res. 275) condemning the 
horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, 
on March 16, 2021, and reaffirming the 
House of Representative’s commitment 
to combating hate, bigotry, and vio-
lence against the Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander community, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 403, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 275 
Whereas, on March 16, 2021, a shooter mur-
dered 8 people and injured 1 in the Atlanta, 
Georgia, region in 3 separate shootings that 
took place at Asian-owned spas; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
mourn the 8 innocent lives lost, 7 of whom 
were women, 6 of whom were women of Asian 
descent, and several of whom were immi-
grants; 
Whereas 
the 
victims 
included 
Xiaojie 
‘‘Emily’’ Tan, Daoyou Feng, Delaina Ashley 
Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Yong Ae Yue, 
Soon Chung ‘‘Julie’’ Park, Hyun Jung Grant, 
and Sun Cha Kim; 
Whereas 49-year-old Xiaojie ‘‘Emily’’ Tan, 
a hardworking mother and the owner of 1 of 
the spas, was a dedicated and caring business 
owner who is survived by her daughter and 
husband; 
Whereas 44-year-old Daoyou Feng was an 
employee who recently began working at 1 of 
the spas; 
Whereas 33-year-old Delaina Ashley Yaun, 
a newlywed and mother of 2, was at 1 of the 
spas to receive a couple’s massage with her 
husband when her life was cut short; 
Whereas 54-year-old Paul Andre Michels 
was a caring husband and a United States 
Army veteran who did maintenance work for 
1 of the spas and is survived by his wife; 
Whereas 63-year-old Yong Ae Yue was a 
mother of 2 sons who was known for her 
kindness and generosity and her love of her 
pet Shih Tzu; 
Whereas 74-year-old Soon Chung ‘‘Julie’’ 
Park was a mother and grandmother who 
helped manage 1 of the spas and helped to 
prepare meals for the employees; 
Whereas 51-year-old Hyun Jung Grant was 
a former elementary school teacher and 
hardworking single mother who dedicated 
her whole life to raising her 2 sons; 
Whereas 69-year-old Sun Cha Kim was a 
wife, mother, and grandmother who enjoyed 
line dancing and had been married for more 
than 50 years; 
Whereas during an interview with the 
Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office, the suspect 
stated that the shootings were not ‘‘racially 
motivated’’, but the investigation is still on-
going and authorities have not ruled out the 
possibility of classifying the attacks as a 
‘‘hate crime’’; 
Whereas the Georgia shooting came in the 
midst of an alarming surge in anti-Asian 
hate crimes and incidents, which has caused 
many Asian Americans across the United 
States to feel fearful and unsafe; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID–19, such as 
the ‘‘Chinese virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan virus’’, and 
‘‘kung flu’’, has perpetuated anti-Asian stig-
ma that has resulted in Asian Americans 
being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated 
for the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas anti-Asian hate crimes increased 
by nearly 150 percent in major cities 
throughout the United States in 2020; 
Whereas according to a recent report by 
Stop AAPI Hate, there were nearly 3,800 re-
ported cases of anti-Asian discrimination re-
lated to COVID–19 between March 19, 2020, to 
February 28, 2021; 
Whereas 68 percent of reported incidents of 
anti-Asian hate targeted Asian-American 
women, a population that has been histori-
cally 
marginalized, 
sexualized, 
and 
fetishized; 
Whereas, on March 19, 2021, President Joe 
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met 
with Asian-American leaders in Georgia and 
reaffirmed their strong commitment to con-
demn and combat racism, xenophobia, and 
violence targeting the Asian-American com-
munity; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
will always remember the victims of these 
shootings and stand in solidarity with those 
affected by this senseless tragedy: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the heinous and inexcusable 
acts of gun violence that led to the tragic 
loss of 8 lives in Georgia on March 16, 2021; 
(2) condemns any racism and sexism in the 
choice of the shooter to target Asian-owned 
businesses and murder 7 women, 6 of whom 
were of Asian descent; 
(3) honors the memory of the victims, of-
fers heartfelt condolences to their families, 
and recognizes that the healing process will 
be long and difficult for the Asian-American 
and Pacific Islander community and all com-
munities impacted by this tragedy; and 
(4) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States Federal Government to com-
bat hate, bigotry, and violence against Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders and to pre-
vent tragedies like this from ever happening 
again. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. FALLON) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognize the gentlewoman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and insert extra-
neous materials on H. Res. 275. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2521 
May 18, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H. Res. 275, condemning the horrific 
shootings that led to the tragic loss of 
eight American lives in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, on March 16. The people of the 
United States mourn the eight inno-
cent lives lost, six of whom were 
women of Asian descent, and several of 
whom were immigrants. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Congresswoman JUDY CHU for her lead-
ership on this issue and for introducing 
this important legislation. 
Over the past year, Asian-Americans 
have been attacked and harassed be-
cause of misinformation and xeno-
phobia that wrongly blamed them for 
the coronavirus pandemic. And, sadly, 
incidents of violence against Asian- 
Americans are on the rise across our 
country. 
The heinous shootings in Georgia was 
a wake-up call for the public to the re-
ality the Asian-American community 
is facing each and every day. Acts of 
violence like these demonstrate why 
we must always call out bigotry and 
hate whenever or wherever we see it. 
We must all speak out against it. 
In New York City, the number of 
anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the 
police increased by 833 percent last 
year, the most out of any major city in 
America. This is simply unacceptable. 
By voting to pass this resolution, the 
House of Representatives will clearly 
state our condemnation of the heinous 
and inexcusable acts of gun violence 
that led to the tragic loss of eight lives 
in Georgia on March 16. 
The resolution also condemns any 
racism and sexism that contributed to 
the shooter’s targeting of the Asian- 
owned businesses and murder of seven 
women, six of whom were of Asian de-
scent. 
This resolution honors the memory 
of the victims and the loved ones they 
leave behind. The healing process will 
be long and difficult for the Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity, and all communities impacted by 
this tragedy. 
b 1830 
Importantly, the resolution affirms 
the commitment of the Federal Gov-
ernment to combat hate, bigotry, and 
violence against Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders, and to prevent trage-
dies like this in the future, a commit-
ment I hope all of my colleagues can 
agree on. 
I am proud to stand in solidarity 
with the Asian-American and Pacific- 
Islander community in calling for an 
end to the targeted attacks like the 
one we saw in Atlanta. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this resolution, I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, what happened on 
March 16, 2021, in Atlanta is a senseless 
tragedy. It is an unconscionable act of 
irrational violence. We grieve with the 
victims’ families, friends, and loved 
ones as they now must cope with this 
tremendous loss. 
Justice must prevail, and the perpe-
trator must be held to account for 
these atrocious murders. That is why it 
is so very unfortunate that this resolu-
tion that we are discussing and consid-
ering tonight on the floor came on a 
rule when it wasn’t even marked up in 
committee. I want to talk about the 
process—both the committee process 
and due process. 
Taking the former first, the com-
mittee process, I have only spent 4 
months here in Washington serving 
this august Chamber, but I did serve 8 
years in the Texas legislature. What I 
noticed was nearly all legislation be-
comes better when it goes through the 
committee process. 
So if this issue was so important, as 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle state—and it should be, it is very 
important—then Members would have 
been allowed to offer amendments 
through the proper committee process, 
which might have, and most likely 
would have, greatly improved this reso-
lution as it comes to the floor today 
and helped garner broader support. 
Our aim should be to send the strong-
est message possible to the American 
people that all bigotry is to be con-
demned and not tolerated. 
We are the most diverse nation on 
the face of the Earth, and our diversity 
is our strength. We value the priceless 
contribution of our American brothers 
and sisters of Asian descent, and that 
should be the point, not to make this 
resolution unnecessarily partisan and 
eventually become specious political 
talking points. 
To the latter point, due process, this 
resolution threatens the rule of law by 
assuming facts in an individual case 
that have yet to be proven. There is no 
question that the shootings in Atlanta 
were horrific, but their motivation has 
yet to be determined under law. 
While all illegal violence will and 
should be roundly and justifiably con-
demned, it is inappropriate for the 
House of Representatives to opine on 
the facts of an individual case when 
those facts will be decided by an 
impaneled jury, a jury that will hear 
all that evidence. A jury should not be 
pressured into deciding the facts one 
way or the other based on political spin 
and partisan pressure directed by this 
Chamber. 
Do my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle understand how this resolu-
tion could damage the ideal of legal 
due process by putting forth an asser-
tion of facts before our justice system 
has had the ability to function? 
The trial for this tragedy in Atlanta 
isn’t over. In fact, it hasn’t even start-
ed yet. This resolution sets a dan-
gerous precedent at this time the way 
it is written. It is a possibly reckless 
path to embark down for such an im-
portant legislative body as the United 
States House of Representatives. 
While this resolution threatens some 
political theater, it is remarkable also 
for what it seems to be conveniently 
omitting from this resolution address-
ing anti-Asian bias. 
House Democrats have left out the 
many ongoing and high-profile lawsuits 
filed by Asian Americans alleging anti- 
Asian discrimination in schools’ and 
universities’ admissions policies. 
So why would our friends across the 
aisle ignore these allegations in this 
resolution? 
At the same time, this resolution in-
cludes the strange statement that ref-
erences the Wuhan virus as anti-Asian. 
There are other elements that are 
clearly anti-Asian that are in this reso-
lution, and should be. But the Wuhan 
virus is where this virus originated. 
Historically, viruses are often named 
for their place of origin. A case in point 
is the West Nile virus. It wasn’t in 
Montana. It was in the West Nile dis-
trict of Uganda. 
Zika was named after the Zika For-
est in Uganda. Ebola was named after 
the Ebola River in Zaire, in central Af-
rica. 
Here in America, we have the Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever named after a 
big mountain chain in the West. A dis-
ease in my native New England, Lyme 
disease, was found in Old Lyme, Con-
necticut. 
So is that going to be geographically 
prejudiced? 
Of course not. 
There are no resolutions condemning 
the use of the words Ebola, Zika, or 
West Nile. So not only have we not 
seen 
resolutions 
condemning 
these 
names, they have also been embodied 
in the United States Code many times 
in reference to the very diseases being 
combated. It is just descriptive. It is 
not insulting by any stretch. 
I could go on, but I think the point is 
made. 
We should be more cautious in this 
legislative body with the statements 
we pass as certainty and the procedural 
precedents we set forth in the context 
of the judicial system. We should be fo-
cused on allowing the due process to 
play out with justice served, and con-
tinue to condemn vile and evil acts of 
violence against all Americans. 
We should say this to our brothers 
and sisters of Asian descent: We appre-
ciate you, we respect you, we love you, 
and we grieve with you. 
When you break down Americans de-
mographically, Asian Americans are a 
successful group in our country. Asian 
Americans, in their journey, epitomize 
the promise of America. 
I thought it was interesting, the U.S. 
Census Bureau in 2019, the median 
household income for Asian Americans 
was $98,174 compared to, for all Ameri-
cans, $68,703. That is 43 percent higher. 
The history of the Asian-American 
journey is one of prosperity, hope, and 
promise fulfilled. Our Asian-American 
brothers and sisters should be con-
gratulated, admired, and emulated. 
Our hearts go out to the families of 
the victims.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2522 
May 18, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. CHU), who is the chair-
woman of the Congressional Asian Pa-
cific American Caucus and sponsor of 
this important resolution. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of my resolu-
tion, H. Res. 275, to condemn the hor-
rific shootings in Georgia and to reaf-
firm the House of Representatives’ 
strong commitment to combating anti- 
Asian hate, bigotry, and violence. 
As we commemorate Asian American 
and Pacific Islander Heritage Month 
this May, the Asian-American and Pa-
cific-Islander community continues to 
be terrified by the alarming rise in 
anti-Asian hate and violence that have 
become near daily tragedies. 
The bigotry and xenophobia were 
fueled by former President Donald 
Trump and his followers, who used ra-
cial slurs like China virus, Wuhan 
virus, and Kung flu to direct blame and 
anger at innocent Asian Americans, 
who have put lives at risk despite the 
fact that the CDC and World Health Or-
ganization said not to name a virus 
after geographical locations because of 
the stigma it would cause. 
In fact, to date, there have been over 
6,600 anti-Asian hate incidents reported 
in just the past year alone, and two- 
thirds of those have targeted Asian 
women. 
In March, the fear that many Asian 
Americans were feeling reached a crisis 
point when a gunman targeted three 
Asian-owned spas in Georgia, killing 
eight 
people, 
including 
six 
Asian 
women. This killer, so motivated by 
hate, intentionally sought out Asian 
immigrant women. 
In response, I organized a congres-
sional delegation to Atlanta to meet 
with the victims’ families, as well as 
local AAPI leaders. We went there with 
a purpose: to follow the murderer’s 
steps to show how deliberate he was in 
targeting three Asian-owned businesses 
that were nearly 30 miles apart from 
each other. 
Local sheriffs have tried to diminish 
these crimes by saying that the shoot-
er had a sex addiction and a bad day. 
But he had plenty of other places to go 
in that time. Instead, he chose three 
places where Asian women would be 
killed. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
this was a hate crime. That is why I am 
glad 
that 
Georgia prosecutors an-
nounced last week they will be seeking 
enhanced hate crime charges against 
the murderer. 
The victims of these tragic shootings 
were hardworking mothers and grand-
mothers, many in their fifties, sixties, 
and as old as 74. I met with the families 
of two of these women. 
Xiaojie Tan was the owner of one of 
the spas and a mother, who worked 7 
days a week to provide for her family. 
Her 
daughter, 
Jami, 
spoke 
to 
us 
through tears about how unfair it was 
that her mother’s life was cut short on 
her 50th birthday. 
Then there was Young Ae Yue, whose 
son, Robert, told me about his mother 
and how she adored her children and 
loved being a Har Mul Ni, or grand-
mother. She would share her love 
through cooking and karaoke. But 
amid his pain, Robert was angry, too— 
angry that it happened, angry at a nar-
rative that tried to justify it by victim 
blaming, and angry that people moved 
on so quickly. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield an addi-
tional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from California. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, we will 
not move on, and that is what today’s 
resolution is about. We must remember 
Young Ae Yue, Xiaojie Tan, and other 
victims of these horrific shootings in 
Georgia. We must stand up for all of 
those who have been terrorized by anti- 
Asian hate and violence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolu-
tion. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my fellow Texan, Representative 
FALLON, for the opportunity to speak. 
To my colleague, JUDY CHU, I have 
enjoyed working with her and serving 
with her on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, and I have respect for her. 
Let me be clear, Madam Speaker, the 
Atlanta shootings were heartbreaking 
and absolutely unconscionable. I con-
demn, as I imagine all of my colleagues 
do, all hate and all violence against 
any person for any reason. I mourn for 
all Americans who have lost their lives 
to any senseless act of violence. 
Today, my colleagues have brought 
forth a resolution that I believe is 
laced with political jabs and unsub-
stantiated assertions about labeling a 
virus by its geographical origin. 
To say that the term ‘‘Wuhan virus’’ 
drove this individual to commit un-
thinkable crimes is both premature 
and illogical, and it needlessly politi-
cizes this horrible tragedy. It is inap-
propriate, and I believe it is unwise, for 
Congress to presume a motive in the 
middle of an ongoing investigation. 
For the sake of our country, we must 
stop politicizing heinous acts of vio-
lence committed by sick, evil individ-
uals. We must stop making claims that 
supersede and ignore personal responsi-
bility. When an individual commits a 
crime, they are responsible for that 
crime, and our judicial system is there 
to ensure that the individual is held ac-
countable and brought to swift and cer-
tain justice. 
Again, I mourn for the lives lost in 
Georgia, but today’s resolution does 
not strike me as simply and only a sin-
cere attempt to highlight injustice or 
to condemn hate crimes. It reeks, 
Madam Speaker, of scoring political 
points. That is my read. 
It seems to be a veiled criticism of 
President Trump. It is needless and 
more divisive identity politics. We defi-
nitely don’t need more of that in this 
country. I think it is political oppor-
tunism. So I encourage my Democrat 
colleagues and my Republican col-
leagues to reject this and to vote ‘‘no’’ 
for those reasons. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. MFUME), who is a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, Ms. CHU, for bringing us to this 
point. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H. Res. 275, condemning the horrific 
shootings 
in 
Atlanta, 
Georgia, 
on 
March 16, 2021, and reaffirming this 
body’s commitment to combating hate, 
combating bigotry, and combating vio-
lence against the Asian-American com-
munity and the Asia-Pacific Islander 
community. 
b 1845 
It is consistent with this body’s ap-
proach to racism that has affected Af-
rican Americans, Latinos, and Native 
Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I am a bit lost at 
some of the comments that I have lis-
tened to because, on the other side of 
the House, someone mentioned that 
this has everything to do with the 
trial. This has nothing to do with the 
trial. This has to do with those inno-
cent people who were murdered. The 
trial never came up. 
This has nothing to do with trying to 
point fingers. This is about people who 
got up that day with families and all 
died because they happened to be in a 
certain place at a certain time. 
Sometimes when I listen to that, I 
say to myself: Well, you really don’t 
understand. You really don’t under-
stand. Maybe it is nice to be born male 
and White when no one has ever at-
tacked you because of your skin color, 
because of your heritage, because you 
are male. 
I just repudiate all of that. It sickens 
me to see the level of violence being 
perpetrated against Asian Americans 
who represent our friends. They are our 
neighbors. They are our fellow Ameri-
cans, our coworkers. 
Over 600 cases have dotted the news 
throughout this Nation in just the first 
few months of this year, with two- 
thirds of those cases being against 
Asian-American women, where they 
were kicked, and they were beaten, and 
they were stabbed, and they were hit 
with bricks. 
Doesn’t that sicken us to the point 
that we really want to just condemn 
this, as we should? 
In an era of smaller vision, rampant 
apathy, and celebrated mediocrity, we 
desperately need those who will stand

up for that which is right and to fight 
like hell against that which is wrong. I 
urge passage of this resolution. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
My colleague just mentioned that it 
must be nice to be born male and 
White. I was born both, and I didn’t 
choose it. That is the way it happened. 
And then he went on to say: Must be 
nice that no one has ever attacked you 
because you are male and White. 
That is an interesting comment be-
cause I have a dear friend who was 
beaten to within an inch of his life in 
a section of town that was right out-
side of Duke University, and he was 
beaten primarily because he didn’t ‘‘be-
long in that neighborhood.’’ And do 
you know who is at fault for that? The 
very people who beat him. No one else. 
Unfortunately, hate occasionally fills 
all hearts, regardless of someone’s 
shape, size, or shade. 
And that comment in and of itself 
was divisive. On this solemn occasion, 
when we are discussing condemning 
hate, I just find that unfortunate and 
disturbing, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. JOHNSON), a distinguished member 
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H. Res. 275, which is legislation 
introduced by my friend, Congress-
woman JUDY
CHU, which puts the 
House on record condemning the racist 
shootings in Atlanta. 
That is what it does. That is all it 
does, plain and simple. There are no 
politics, no hidden meanings, no digs at 
ex-President Donald Trump. That has 
nothing to do with it. It is just putting 
Congress on record condemning the 
racist shootings in Atlanta. 
Atlanta and the South are no strang-
ers to White folks utilizing violence to 
terrorize and harm communities of 
color, but even though the cities past 
and present are marred by white su-
premacy, Atlanta is also a city too 
busy to hate. It is a city that continues 
to be a catalyst for progress and tri-
umph. 
Madam Speaker, it is a hotbed in the 
South for justice. The city’s heart bled 
for the victims killed on March 16, but 
that heart did not stop beating. 
Last summer, we marched for Black 
lives. Today, I stand for my Asian 
brothers and sisters, calling for a stop, 
an end to Asian hate. 
I thank Representative CHU for her 
leadership, and I am proud to support 
this commonsense, straightforward leg-
islation. I urge as strongly as I can, 
with as much moral clarity as I can, 
every Member of this body, both on the 
other side of the aisle and also on this 
side of the aisle, to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CONNOLLY), a distinguished mem-
ber of the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee and the chairman of the Gov-
ernment Operations Subcommittee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship. 
I also want to salute our colleague, 
Congresswoman CHU, for her persistent 
advocacy and her moral clarity on the 
subject we address today. 
I commend the House for passing the 
resolution to condemn the horrific 
shootings in Atlanta on March 16 and 
to reaffirm the House’s commitment to 
combating hate, bigotry, and violence 
against the AAPI community. 
Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, we have seen 
racist sentiment, discrimination, and 
hate crimes targeting Asian Americans 
skyrocket to alarming levels. Members 
of the AAPI community have been call-
ing out for help for over a year now. 
They should not have to live in fear of 
facing discrimination, hate, or violence 
while walking in their neighborhood, 
going to the grocery store, or going to 
work. 
Since the pandemic’s outbreak, there 
was a 1,900 percent increase in violence 
against this community in 2020 alone 
and a 150 percent increase in hate 
crimes against AAPIs in America’s 
major cities. 
There were 3,800 reported cases of 
Asian-American discrimination related 
to COVID–19 over the past year, 68 per-
cent of which targeted Asian-American 
women. Three in five Asian Americans 
have experienced discrimination during 
the pandemic. 
Let me be clear: These events do not 
occur in a vacuum. America has a dark 
history of vilifying minorities, includ-
ing targeting the Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander community, in par-
ticular, and using Federal law to en-
able that discrimination and even vio-
lence. 
Look no further than the Chinese Ex-
clusion Act in 1882, the first Federal 
law to bar an entire group of people 
from immigrating purely based on 
their race, and the internment of Japa-
nese Americans in 1942. 
No one should feel unsafe in America 
ever. We all play a role in stopping the 
spread of violence and racism against 
the AAPI community. Solidarity is 
greater than racism. Today, we are all 
Asian Americans. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
agree with my colleague that no one, 
no American, should live in fear, Asian 
American, African American, European 
American, Hispanic American, or oth-
erwise. No one. Because if you are not 
safe, then you are not free. 
That is what we are here for, to guar-
antee equal protection under the law. 
Safety and freedom are our most sol-
emn tasks while serving in this Cham-
ber. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a co-lead-
er of this resolution. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this bicameral resolu-
tion denouncing anti-Asian hate, and I 
offer once again my deepest condo-
lences to the families that have suf-
fered these hate tragedies. 
I thank Representative CHU for this 
very critical and timely legislation. 
Too often, we have seen hate and dis-
crimination turn to violence and ter-
ror, and we must reaffirm again our 
commitment to stand against all forms 
of bigotry and hatred. Racism simply 
has no place in our communities in this 
Nation. 
As I travel across Georgia’s Sixth 
District, I am very privileged to inter-
act with so many members of the 
Asian-American community. They are 
our small business owners, teachers, 
doctors, electricians, contractors, and 
financial analysts. 
I actually had the opportunity to 
spend time with one of the families 
who had suffered one of these tragedies 
there in Atlanta, I believe within the 
Chair’s district. I can tell you the pro-
found pain that emanated from them 
and that grief, and I understand that 
completely. 
We have to remember that we are all 
made stronger by the community that 
surrounds us, who lifts us up in time of 
need, and who makes our home the 
best place to live and raise a family, 
and that is right here in the United 
States of America. We must never lose 
sight of the power of walking in each 
other’s shoes. And, yes, I have walked 
in these families’ shoes. 
We must never lose sight of under-
standing the path that others have 
traveled and of celebrating the wonder-
ful differences that we all bring to this 
great Nation today. 
We again stand with our friends and 
our neighbors in the Asian-American 
community to denounce hate and to 
work together toward a future filled 
with love, acceptance, and faith for a 
brighter world. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX), co- 
leader of this resolution. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for yield-
ing. 
Across our country, the Asian-Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander community 
has felt deeply under attack. Over the 
past year, xenophobic political leaders 
used dangerous rhetoric to stir up ha-
tred against many immigrant commu-
nities, including the Asian-American 
community during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Soon, words became action, and on 
March 16, 2021, the Atlanta area saw

the tragic and, in some ways, inevi-
table result when eight lives were 
taken from us. 
The victims of this attack included 
mothers and grandmothers, fathers and 
sons, teachers and veterans. These are 
lives that cannot be restored, leaving 
pain that cannot be forgotten. 
Today, we honor their memories. To-
morrow, the House will vote on a bipar-
tisan and bicameral resolution that I 
coauthored with Chair JUDY CHU of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus. It calls on Congress to affirm 
our commitment to combat hate and 
bigotry against the AAPI community 
and condemns the hateful actions 
taken in Atlanta. 
It is a step in the right direction, but 
only a step. America is and has always 
been a nation of immigrants, a fact 
that deserves to be celebrated. I proud-
ly represent one of the most diverse 
districts in the Nation, with about a 
quarter of my constituents having been 
born in another country. 
When one group of Americans is 
hurting, we are all hurting. Watching 
my son grow up in our diverse commu-
nity reminds me that none of us are 
born with hatred in our hearts. Rather, 
it is something that is taught. 
As we vote today, let’s teach compas-
sion, let’s teach acceptance, let’s teach 
empathy. I rise in support of this reso-
lution. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1900 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GREEN), a distinguished member of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Ms. CHU for her diligence 
and her persistence in getting this 
done. 
This is a moment for sober reflection. 
This is a time for us to understand that 
there is a lot of pain in the Asian- 
American community. 
There are people who are suffering, 
and it gives us an opportunity now to 
let them know that they are not alone, 
to let them know that liberty and jus-
tice for all applies to them, to let them 
know that we will stand against the 
hate as we stand with them. It is a 
time for sober reflection. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I will close with a 
statement of principle that no House 
resolution can come close to matching 
in its compelling moral clarity. It is 
the statement of one of the greatest 
Americans who ever lived, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. 
I will be honest, it gave me goose 
bumps as a child and it gives me goose 
bumps every time I hear it or if I say 
it. 
To quote this great man: ‘‘I have a 
dream my four little children will one 
day live in a nation where they will not 
be judged by the color of their skin, 
but by the content of their character.’’ 
Asian Americans certainly have dem-
onstrated great character with their 
numerous and countless contributions 
to this American experiment. 
We all mourn the victims of this at-
tack, including the family members 
and community they leave behind. 
I join my colleagues in seeking the 
fullest expression of justice that our 
system is designed to deliver. 
That gets back to culture, the cul-
ture of this Chamber. Sometimes you 
hear from the mouth of babes. Well, I 
am a rookie and a freshman. I have 
only been here 4 months. This is the 
most hyperpartisan legislative body in 
this country, and it is awful. I am not 
saying that my party may not have 
done something similar in the past. I 
don’t know; I wasn’t here. 
I served in the Texas Legislature, 
both the House and the Senate, and I 
was very proud of the fact that almost 
99 percent of the things we passed in 
that body had at least some bipartisan 
support because we worked together, 
for the betterment of our State, to 
make Texas better. 
Why can’t we do that here, for the 
betterment of our country? 
Not everything has to be partisan. I 
know it is now, but it doesn’t have to 
be. We need to work together to change 
that culture. 
I am a back-benching freshman. I 
don’t have a lot of say. My voice isn’t 
really heard here yet. That is okay. 
But if there is ever a day where it is, I 
pledge to do everything I can to work, 
when possible, on a bipartisan basis be-
cause it is better for this country. 
We don’t always have to score cheap 
political points, looking down the road 
for the next fundraiser or the next elec-
tion. We can really do what is best for 
the country. Not red America, not blue 
America. America. 
We had that opportunity here with 
this resolution. It could have been 
written if we had the committee proc-
ess. The minority party could have 
contributed to it. We could have 
worked together on it. We could have 
pretty much guaranteed a 435-to-noth-
ing vote. Because, at the end of the 
day, what I can recall in the Rules 
Committee was talking about sending 
a strong message that hate will not be 
tolerated, bigotry will not be tolerated. 
Yes, this country has had an ugly 
past. It disgusts me. But when you are 
raised the right way, you see it for 
what it is: evil, unacceptable. 
We are the greatest country history 
has ever known. By working together, 
we can ensure that our children and 
their children enjoy the fruits and the 
benefits and the labor and the bounty 
of this country. I wish that were the 
case with this resolution, because it 
could have been. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my distin-
guished 
colleagues, 
Representative 
CHU, Representative MCBATH, and Rep-
resentative 
BOURDEAUX, 
for 
their 
thoughtful and important resolution. 
The House of Representatives must 
take a stand against anti-Asian bigotry 
and hate, and condemn the terrible 
shootings in Atlanta. 
H. Res. 275 does just that. I urge 
every Member on both sides of the aisle 
to support this resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
millions of people here and around the globe 
were shocked to learn of the shootings at 
three Atlanta spas last March that killed eight 
people and injured one. Six of the eight vic-
tims were of Asian descent. 
Many of us saw a link between the discrimi-
natory and often hateful rhetoric against the 
Asian-American 
community 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic and this unspeakable 
act of violence. In fact, the last year has seen 
an unacceptable rise in anti-Asian racism and 
violent attacks, especially against the elderly. 
There are many such incidents across the na-
tion that are said to be unreported as well. 
As the Dean of the Georgia Delegation, I 
strongly condemn these heinous acts of vio-
lence against our Asian-American brothers 
and sisters. They have no place in Georgia or 
anywhere else in our nation for that matter. 
I therefore urge my colleagues to support 
not only this important resolution to condemn 
this act of violence and to remember the lives 
that were so tragically taken from us last 
March in Atlanta. I also urge them to support 
the bipartisan COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act to 
bolster the investigation and prosecution of 
hate crimes in the United States. 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, we cannot 
countenance the culture of hate in our nation 
that leads to Asian and Pacific Islander Ameri-
cans 
being 
harassed, 
assaulted, 
and 
scapegoated for the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Hateful rhetoric has deadly consequences. 
Xiaojie ‘‘Emily’’ Tan, Daoyou Feng, Delaina 
Ashley Yaun Gonzalez, Paul Andre Michels, 
Yong Ae Yue, Soon Chung ‘‘Julie’’ Park, Hyun 
Jung Grant, and Suncha Kim were forever 
taken from their families on March 16 in a 
shooting fueled by this racist hate. 
These eight victims deserve swift justice for 
the heinous and inexcusable act of gun vio-
lence that ended their lives. 
But all Asian and Pacific Islander Americans 
deserve for this Congress to stand up, con-
demn the violence, and commit to ending ha-
tred and bigotry. That is why I am a cosponsor 
of H. Res. 275. 
On behalf of the majority Asian/Pacific Is-
lander community I represent, I join my col-
leagues in expressing our condolences to the 
families of the victims of the Atlanta shooting. 
And I join all those voting for H. Res. 275 
in affirming that crimes of hate against Asians, 
Pacific Islanders, or any racial or ethnic group 
have no place in America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 403, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
resolution and the preamble. 
The question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
they ayes appeared to have it.

CONGRATULATING THERESA 
MORRIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR) is recognized for 60 minutes as 
the designee of the majority leader. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the achieve-
ment and advancement of a longtime 
member of our Ninth Congressional 
District team, Theresa Morris of To-
ledo, Ohio. 
Theresa is an intelligent, compas-
sionate daughter born into a working- 
class family in Toledo. She is a true 
public servant. Theresa has served as a 
congressional aide in our office for 27 
tireless and honorable years. 
She has advanced her capacities 
across a wide spectrum of duties, such 
as outreaching to small businesses, co-
ordinating the district’s efforts on the 
Congressional Art Competition, serving 
as a grants and funding coordinator, 
and being a dependable project assist-
ant. 
She developed firsthand experience 
on a far-ranging set of issues relating 
to immigration, the State Department, 
and Homeland Security. Her service 
has been invaluable to thousands upon 
thousands of our citizenry. 
Theresa knows and loves our Toledo 
community as fiercely and as well as 
anyone. That is why I am thrilled that 
she was recently appointed to serve on 
the City Council of Toledo, Ohio, tak-
ing her first step into elected office. I 
could not be more proud of her, her 
family, and all those who treasure The-
resa as a coworker, a friend, and a con-
fidante. 
Theresa is a graduate of Start High 
School in Toledo; Alma College in 
Michigan; and Lourdes University in 
Sylvania, Ohio, where she earned her 
bachelor of arts and master of organi-
zational leadership degrees, respec-
tively. 
Theresa has served on the boards of 
the YWCA of Greater Toledo, the City 
of Toledo Youth Commission, Team 
Recovery, WGTE Public Media, and the 
Arts Council of Lake Erie West. 
Theresa received the 2018 Distin-
guished Hispanic Ohioan Award. She 
has a certificate in Minority Executive 
Leadership, and is a graduate of the 
Toledo Citizens Police Academy. 
Her interests are wide-ranging and 
unending. Some have observed she may 
be the longest-serving Hispanic con-
gressional staff member in United 
States history. Mark that one down for 
the record. 
Madam Speaker, Theresa is made of 
good humor, tenacity, and grit. She al-
ways has a smile. While we are sad to 
see her go, I can tell you with absolute 
certainty that no one is better pre-
pared to fight for the working people of 
Toledo than Theresa. 
Along with the entire staff, I wish 
her fair winds and following seas as she 
takes her career in public service to 
new heights on the ‘‘Good Ship To-
ledo.’’ I look forward to working close-
ly with Toledo Councilwoman Morris 
as she ably steers her craft full steam 
ahead. 
Onward, Councilwoman Theresa Mor-
ris. God bless you. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES OF 
OUR CHOICES IN ELECTIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, right now, 
we are facing a critical question for our 
country. It is a question about whether 
our country wants to be first or last. 
A lot has been made, obviously, of 
the former President’s agenda, which 
he referred to as ‘‘America First.’’ 
I think, unfortunately, we are sitting 
here right now, and our country is now 
too often looking at America last. 
There are a number of issues that are 
facing the constituents that I rep-
resent, but I believe this is true for 
people all across the country. I have 
spoken many times here on this floor 
about this. 
In Texas, our border is under siege. 
In Texas, it is a very real impact on 
our life, our communities. I share that 
with my colleagues all across the coun-
try, all 50 States represented here. 
It is very real in Texas, but it is very 
real in our country about the impact of 
the broken border. It is very real right 
now with people who run small busi-
nesses and need to hire people and they 
can’t because we are paying people 
more not to work than to work. 
It is very real when people are going 
to buy gas at the pump, and it is well 
over $3 a gallon. 
It is very real when you try to buy a 
house, and lumber is up 470 percent. 
It is very real when you want to go 
get the healthcare of your choice and 
you can’t. 
It is very real when you turn on the 
TV, and you watch what was Middle 
East peace now turning into chaos as 
our friends in Israel are being at-
tacked. 
There 
are 
consequences 
to 
our 
choices in elections. There are con-
sequences to the leadership you have in 
your country. There are consequences 
to the decisions we make. 
I would think that all Americans, re-
gardless of which side of the aisle you 
fall, whether you are in Congress or 
you are back home watching, you want 
America to be first. You want America 
to succeed. You want America to do 
well. You want our allies to succeed. 
As you see, I am putting a compari-
son here of what the world looks like 
with America first and what the world 
looks like with America last. 
Admittedly, we had the intermittent 
reality of dealing with the pandemic. 
But just over a year ago, we were deal-
ing with record low unemployment, 
record levels of employment for minor-
ity communities in our country, a 
booming economy, with strong eco-
nomic growth. America was leading 
and moving the world forward. 
Today, we have jobs that are vacant, 
not being filled. Small businesses com-
ing up to me, saying: ‘‘Our whole liveli-
hoods are getting destroyed; we are 
going to lose everything we have built, 
because we can’t hire anybody.’’ 
I go to restaurants and I see ‘‘help 
wanted’’ signs. They are struggling to 
have anybody there to serve. People 
are going back. It is not the virus. Peo-
ple are going back. They just can’t get 
service. Every businessperson I talk to 
in the State of Texas faces the same di-
lemma, the same problem: They can’t 
hire anybody. 
b 1915 
Now why might that be? Could it be 
that in the infinite wisdom of this body 
that we have spent $6 trillion over the 
last year—$6 trillion over the last 
year—and that, as part of doing that, 
we have funded unemployment at lev-
els that is making it more attractive 
for Americans to choose not to work 
than to work. Americans are logical 
human beings. When presented with 
that choice, they are going to make 
that choice. Some aren’t, but many do. 
And now, you are owning a res-
taurant and you are trying to have 
wait staff or people to bus tables or 
cooks, and you can’t hire them. You 
are trying to run a landscaping com-
pany, you can’t hire them. You are try-
ing to run a cleaning business, you 
can’t hire them. 
This is real, and it is happening right 
now in real time. The result, an econ-
omy stagnating. We are not taking off 
with growth. Now we have got infla-
tionary pressures because we just spent 
$6 trillion. You run the risk of stagfla-
tion, low economic growth, higher cost 
of goods, all while we are now dealing 
with the uncertainty of a world in 
chaos. 
A year ago, small businesses were 
thriving. Now, small businesses are 
getting crushed. A year ago, not too 
long ago, gas was $1.77 a gallon. Now 
we are looking at gas over $3 per gal-
lon. As I said, lumber prices are up 478 
percent; copper is up, I think, 50 to 70 
percent. 
My parents right now are trying to 
go through building a house, and they 
are not sure if the dollars they have 
got set aside to do it are going to work, 
because all of these prices are going up, 
up, up at extraordinary rates. 
There is a cost to bad leadership and 
bad decision-making. Our border was 
well on its way to becoming secure. In 
April last year, we had 20,000 apprehen-
sions. How many apprehensions did we

May 18, 2021 
have this year in April? 178,000. We 
have had over 530-something thousand 
apprehensions from January 1 through 
the end of April. We have had almost 
600,000 apprehensions to date, based on 
the information I have through mid- 
May. My sources at the border tell me 
that we have had 300,000 individuals 
who have gotten away or who have 
been released. 
I went down to the border, one of the 
many trips I have taken to the border 
because the district I represent is 
about 150 miles away. I went down at 
night, and I met with about 50 different 
migrants who had just come across the 
Rio Grande. This was a group that I 
just met with, and they are driving 
back down the road. I actually followed 
them in my truck with the headlights 
on, so they weren’t just walking in the 
middle of the darkness to go get over 
to where the processing center is. 
America first looks like this. Signifi-
cant amounts of immigration. Legal 
immigration hasn’t dipped below a mil-
lion per year in some 20 years. Amer-
ica’s doors are open, you-all. The idea 
that people want to say ‘‘Close our 
doors,’’ that is not the case. But you 
want to have operational control of 
your border. 
I am going to talk about Israel in a 
minute. Israel put fences in place be-
cause they wanted to control their bor-
ders. You know what? They worked. Of 
course they worked. 
We have fences in place in southern 
California. Illegal immigration in the 
1990s, which was astronomical, over 
half a million, dropped to 40- or 50,000. 
Why? Fences work. In Brownsville- 
McAllen, there is fences and there is 
infrastructure 
around 
Brownsville. 
There isn’t in McAllen. Guess where 
the traffic goes? McAllen. 
This is not rocket science. When you 
are putting America first, you put in 
infrastructure. Border Patrol wants it, 
they have asked for it. It works. Yes, 
some people go around, yes, some peo-
ple try to go over, but if you have ever 
spent a minute at our southern bor-
der—side note I would offer to the Vice 
President of the United States, that 
should she actually wish to do her job 
in supposedly running this whole bor-
der security task force, come on down 
to Texas. So far she hasn’t. In the 2 
months that she has been allegedly in 
charge, our Madam Vice President 
could come see that instead of secu-
rity, we have utter chaos. 
Here is the thing. These are human 
beings. These are not political pawns. 
These are human beings, seeking a bet-
ter life. I don’t begrudge any one of 
these immigrants who are seeking to 
come to our country. God bless them. I 
would try to help any one of them that 
were coming across to figure out where 
they needed to go. They are human 
beings, all of God’s creatures, but they 
shouldn’t be endangered because we are 
sending up false signals that it is a 
good idea for people like the 7-year-old 
girl that I talked to on the border who 
was all by herself coming from Guate-
mala to America. She didn’t have a 
parent, didn’t have an uncle, didn’t 
have an aunt, didn’t have a brother, 
didn’t have a sister. She was by herself. 
The young man who was right next to 
her, I said, ‘‘Where did you meet this 
young girl?’’ He said, ‘‘Midway through 
Mexico.’’ She was 7, you-all, 7. 
Depending on which nonprofit, non-
partisan groups you listen to, we know 
that upwards of 20 to 30 percent of 
women that are on this journey get 
abused. We know the cartels are mak-
ing massive amounts of money moving 
human beings for profit. 
We know that fentanyl, the most 
dangerous narcotic that is currently 
out there, or one of the most, we have 
now had more in 2021 in this calendar 
year in 41⁄2 months than in all of 2020. 
Fentanyl. Our kids are dying. There is 
an opioid epidemic. 
What does this administration do? 
Hey, I have got a good idea, let’s have 
processing centers in McAllen, let’s 
have all of the Border Patrol go down 
to McAllen and have to run processing 
centers instead of actually policing our 
borders between the ports of entry and 
trying to stop the flow of fentanyl and 
dangerous narcotics into our country. 
There is a consequence to not doing 
your job. This administration is not 
doing its job. This administration, 
worse than not doing its job, it is pur-
posely harming our country in the 
false name of compassion. Instead of 
having secure borders, instead of allow-
ing people to come to our country le-
gally, safely, we endanger immigrants 
and say that that is somehow being 
compassionate. 
How is that compassionate? How is it 
compassionate when the Gulf Cartel, 
the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel 
is making millions of dollars moving 
human beings for profit? How is it com-
passionate when the Cartel del Noreste 
of Los Zetas in Nuevo Laredo is mak-
ing millions of dollars moving human 
beings for profit? 
When the district attorney in Ken-
dall County, Nicole Bishop, a county I 
represent, and I visited, and she talked 
about the nine illegal immigrants 
found in an automobile being driven by 
an American citizen employee of that 
Cartel del Noreste. It had nine illegal 
immigrants in there, two tied up in the 
trunk, and they were being taken to a 
stash house in Houston, Texas, to be 
put into the human trafficking and sex 
trafficking trade. 
America first is about jobs, economic 
growth, a strong border, standing with 
our friends in Israel, affordable com-
modities like gas. America last is a 
wide open border in which Americans 
are endangered, ranches are overrun, 
cartels are empowered, immigrants are 
abused, prices go up, commodity prices 
go up, businesses can’t hire people, and 
we abandon Israel. 
America first versus America last. I 
have got more to say about this, which 
will surprise no one. But my friend 
from Pennsylvania is here, and I would 
certainly love to turn the floor over to 
my good friend from Pennsylvania 
should he wish to opine. 
Mr. PERRY. I would, and I thank the 
great gentleman from Texas. I agree 
with him on the position he is taking, 
America first versus this America last 
agenda. 
I am from Pennsylvania. People say, 
‘‘Well, what do you care? You are a 
long way from the border.’’ And I will 
tell you another great Pennsylvanian 
is now running for governor, Lou 
Barletta. He was just a small-town 
mayor in Pennsylvania coal country, 
as far away from the border as you 
would have thought, but he realized 
just over the course of a couple years 
his tax base stayed the same, Chip, 
stayed exactly the same, but his popu-
lation in his little town doubled. And 
the crime in his town doubled. He could 
no longer afford the police budget. 
When a gentleman, one of the resi-
dents, confronted a person who was a 
member of the Latin Kings and said, 
‘‘Stop trying to sell drugs to my chil-
dren,’’ and that man pulled out—the 
gentleman, not the gentleman, the car-
tel member, illegal foreign national, il-
legal alien pulled out his gun and shot 
that man right in the head right there 
in the street. 
And that started this movement that 
illegal immigration—it shouldn’t even 
be called that. Immigration is legal. It 
is not illegal. It is not immigration. 
This illegal crossing into our country, 
it is cultural piracy. It is piracy of our 
country, of our economy, of our safety. 
A lot of attention was drawn in the 
little town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, 
because of Mayor Lou. He said, ‘‘I am 
not going to stand for it, and I don’t 
agree with the Federal Government’s 
policies, and we are going to fight right 
here in our State and end this cra-
ziness.’’ Then, of course, they took him 
to court. The United States Govern-
ment fought their own citizen to put 
American citizens last and these other 
folks first. 
Representative ROY, I just came back 
from the border. You live close to it. I 
go from Pennsylvania down to the bor-
der. Some things that you know are 
true, but you have got to see them with 
your own eyes. Maybe people don’t re-
alize. They think, Well, this is all poor, 
downtrodden, fearful people coming 
from Mexico or Central America. Two- 
thirds of the people that we saw com-
ing across the border at that time, two- 
thirds were coming from other than 
Central America and Mexico. 
I have got a news flash for everybody. 
You can’t come to Mexico with a one- 
way plane ticket. You have got to get 
your way in and you have to have a 
plane ticket to leave. So these people, 
they are flying into Cancun, they are 
walking up to the border, and they are 
discarding their go-home ticket be-
cause if the Border Patrol catches 
them with that ticket, they can return 
them to that country. So they leave it 
right there at the border. These people 
are flying to Mexico to walk across our 
border. Two-thirds of them.

So the last people I saw before I left 
that trip, Chip, the Border Patrol was 
detaining and processing, so to speak, 
Russian, Azerbaijan, and Cuban. All of 
them flew into Mexico to cross our bor-
der. 
And the other thing we found on the 
other side of the wall because, as you 
talk about, and I know you have, the 
breaks in the wall where construction 
was stopped by the Biden administra-
tion, so you can walk right around the 
other side, not only all the little shoes, 
the little shoes of little kids that they 
leave right there, it is heartbreaking 
when you see those. I have got chil-
dren, you have children, those little 
shoes. That is an indicator of all those 
kids that walked the whole way up to 
the border. 
But you know what else is heart-
breaking? The packages of Plan B left 
on the other side of the wall. You know 
what that is for, right? Because all 
these little girls and these ladies were 
abused coming up to our border by the 
cartels. 
When I got there, of course we 
watched people coming across the bor-
der, and the cartel members are stand-
ing right on the other side, waving to 
us, giving us the old one-finger salute, 
making a joke of all of us in this coun-
try and the people they just trafficked 
into this country. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware 
that the Vice President was tapped by 
the President to take charge of this 
crisis? 
Mr. PERRY. I am aware of that. Of 
course, when I was there, at the time I 
think it was 44 days since the Vice 
President was tapped to take charge of 
the border. 
Mr. ROY. To your knowledge, has the 
Vice President visited the southern 
border of the United States in the now 
almost 2 months that she has been al-
legedly in charge? 
Mr. PERRY. Not unless it was a se-
cret mission. 
Mr. ROY. When you think about the 
various things it is impacting—you 
represent 
constituents 
in 
Pennsyl-
vania, and I in Texas—you talked 
about the reach of illegal immigration, 
narcotics, 
cartels, 
and 
gangs 
into 
Pennsylvania. 
Does the gentleman agree, when we 
had the previous administration put-
ting America first, does the gentleman 
agree that our economic situation and 
job situation and price of goods and 
services situation was far better and 
that small businesses were thriving 
versus today when small businesses 
can’t hire anybody? 
Does the gentleman agree that com-
modities—gasoline, wood, housing sup-
plies—were cheaper and more afford-
able, and today they are now sky-
rocketing through the roof after $6 tril-
lion of spending? 
Does the gentleman agree that the 
border was becoming secure under an 
America First agenda, and now it is 
wide open and being abused? 
Does the gentleman agree that we 
had historic Middle East peace with 
our friends in Israel, and making our 
country safer, by the way, in the proc-
ess in holding the line against Iran and 
our enemies, and now we have got 
Israel under attack and an administra-
tion saddling up with our stated 
enemy, Iran? 
Does the gentleman agree that all of 
these are stark contrasts? 
Mr. PERRY. I do agree. By the way, 
while I was at the border, individuals 
from Iran illegally entered the coun-
try. In 4 to 5 months in this country 
under this administration, we have 
gone back four to five decades in infla-
tion, gas lines, illegal immigration, 
and wide open border. 
I mean, everything is turned on its 
head. Everything that was good about 
America 5 months ago is now turning 
the other direction just because of 
these 
policy 
changes. 
These 
are 
changes made in this House of Rep-
resentatives. These are made right at 
the top by the President unilaterally 
destroying the opportunity for Ameri-
cans, importing unskilled, unprepared 
labor. One of the places that we visited, 
Chip, was a food bank right on the bor-
der. 
b 1930 
The Biden administration will say 
these foreign nationals, these illegal 
aliens, don’t avail themselves to the 
public largesse, that they don’t get 
money from the American taxpayer. 
Meanwhile, they wanted to get rid of 
the public charge requirement. If they 
didn’t care about it, why was it such a 
big deal? 
Also, your tax dollars go to the food 
bank. They don’t necessarily go to the 
illegal foreign national. They go to the 
food bank, and then the food bank 
gives the food to the illegal foreign na-
tionals. 
They are taking away opportunity. 
They are taking away the labor that 
Americans need for their first jobs. 
When your child gets out of high 
school, looking for their first job— 
when I was 13 and got my first job, I 
didn’t have any skills. Do you know 
what I could do? I could show up on 
time with a good attitude. That is 
what I could do. 
Well, if somebody is willing to work 
for half price and show up on time with 
a good attitude, guess what? This 
American citizen doesn’t get a job. 
That is what is happening in the last 4 
to 5 months. 
Mr. ROY. I will be mindful of your 
time whenever you have to go on, but 
would you agree that if you go back 
and say, all right, let’s go look at how 
the America First agenda was per-
forming a couple of years ago, that the 
unemployment rate in April 2018 was 
3.6 percent, that today the unemploy-
ment rate is 6.1 percent, that the pov-
erty rate in 2019 was 101⁄2 percent, that 
the poverty rate today is 13.7 percent 
projected, that the Consumer Price 
Index in April 2019 was 2 percent, that 
today the Consumer Price Index is at 
4.2 percent and skyrocketing. 
If you compare where we were with 
respect to energy a couple of years 
ago—and I know that my friend has a 
heart for energy; obviously, it is very 
important to his State as it is to mine 
in Texas—that under the Trump ad-
ministration for the first time in near-
ly 70 years, the United States became a 
net energy exporter, right? 
Mr. PERRY. Right. 
Mr. ROY. Making us freer, stronger, 
with more abundant, more affordable 
energy, we became the number one pro-
ducer of oil and natural gas in the 
world, ahead of Russia and Saudi Ara-
bia. 
Natural gas production reached a 
record high of 34.9 quads in 2019 fol-
lowing record production in 2018 and 
2017. The average American family 
saved $2,500 a year in lower electric 
bills. 
Now, what do we have? A shutdown 
Keystone pipeline, and an administra-
tion saying we can’t frack in Western 
lands. 
We rejoined the Paris climate agree-
ment to have the United States foot 
the bill, billions to the United Nations 
climate fund. 
We have suspended the leases on Fed-
eral lands. As I said, a complete Fed-
eral land ban would increase foreign 
dependence by 2 million barrels a day. 
Gas prices are at a 7-year high. I could 
go on and on. 
Does the gentleman agree that there 
are consequences to an agenda like the 
previous administration’s that puts the 
country first versus an administration 
that is perfectly fine putting the coun-
try last in order to go achieve some 
sort of, I don’t know, fealty to the Eu-
ropean social welfare state and make 
yourself seem, I don’t know, welcomed 
in Davos? 
Mr. PERRY. It does make you won-
der, the good gentleman from Texas, 
who these folks that get elected to of-
fice represent. Do they represent their 
constituents, American citizens, or 
somebody else? 
You talked about closing the Key-
stone pipeline. Now, what does that do? 
Does everybody think that we don’t get 
any oil anymore? No. We just pay more 
for it, right? 
We put it on trucks. We put it on 
trains instead of through a pipeline. 
Somehow, that makes us feel good. 
That costs us all a lot more money, 
and if you are not making much 
money—first of all, I remember the 
days when I couldn’t fill up my gas 
tank. You would get five bucks, and 
you would make that last all week. 
Those were the same days when me and 
my boss—since I was underage, my 
boss pumped gas with a firearm on his 
hip because there were even and odd 
days. You could only get gas, based on 
your license plate, on an even or odd 
day because there wasn’t enough, and 
prices were going through the roof 
then. And we are back into it now. 
At the same time, like I said, you 
wonder whose constituency is this. Is 
this America first or somebody else 
first?

They closed the Keystone pipeline, 
and then we talk about relieving sanc-
tions for Nord Stream 2. That is the 
Russian pipeline. Oh, well, I am glad 
we are happy to support Russia getting 
all the gas to where they want to get, 
to their market, but apparently, Amer-
ica is not allowed to do that. 
Whether it is inflation—oh, by the 
way, you don’t see that happening ei-
ther, as if it were true. There is noth-
ing happening at the border, and infla-
tion is not occurring. Go buy a 2 by 4 
right now. 
Mr. ROY. Yes, a piece of plywood. 
Mr. PERRY. Go by a sheet of ply-
wood, right? Exactly. 
You are paying $100 for a three-quar-
ter-inch sheet of plywood, and you are 
paying eight bucks for a 2 by 4, which 
5 months ago was two bucks. That is 
inflation. 
They can tell us all they want to that 
this agenda that they have works for 
America. We are Americans. It is not 
working for us. 
Mr. ROY. I was just explaining, be-
fore the gentleman arrived, that my 
parents are in the midst of building a 
house. They are beginning to wonder 
now whether or not they are going to 
be able to afford it by the end of the 
build because of the price of lumber, 
because of the price of concrete that is 
going up, because you have to have 
forms for the concrete and you have to 
have labor. 
Now, we are having a shortage of 
labor because we are paying people 
more to not work than to work, in the 
infinite wisdom of my colleagues on 
the other side of aisle who believe you 
can throw $6 trillion into the economy 
and not have consequences. 
Is the gentleman aware that it only 
took us $4.1 trillion in today’s dollars 
to win all of World War II from begin-
ning to end? Yet, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle felt like it would 
be a good idea to dump $6 trillion into 
the 
economy 
and 
believe 
that 
it 
wouldn’t have the consequence of infla-
tion, that it wouldn’t have the con-
sequence of paying people more not to 
work than to work, and destroy jobs, 
destroy livelihoods, destroy small busi-
nesses. 
Now, we see the America First en-
ergy policy under the previous admin-
istration where we had abundant oil, 
abundant energy, and now an America 
last where you have lines. I mean, who 
is President? Is it Jimmy Carter or Joe 
Biden? 
Mr. PERRY. It is Jimmy Carter, too, 
right? It is not only the third term of 
Obama, but it is the second term of 
Jimmy Carter. 
We lived through that energy crisis, 
and we were told then that we were 
running out of fuel. But that was yet 
another lie, and, of course, now we 
don’t have any jobs, right? 
Meanwhile, we closed down the Key-
stone pipeline. How many jobs was 
that? And we are told that you can go 
make solar panels. It is not America 
First; it is China first. Those solar pan-
els, what they call rare-earth minerals, 
that is another fallacy. They are not 
rare. They are only rare in the United 
States because we are not allowed to 
get them because we have laws that 
preclude us from going to get them 
that makes them cost-ineffective, so 
we have to import them from China or 
other places. 
China does well. This is a China first 
policy, not an America First policy. 
This is coming from this administra-
tion and other administrations or aco-
lytes to those policies. 
Mr. ROY. I saw a photograph today 
that had a person who was driving a 
Tesla. And God bless Tesla for making 
technology. I am all for it. But the per-
son in their virtue-signaling, self-con-
gratulation of driving their Tesla is 
driving around with a license plate 
that says: ‘‘NO FUEL,’’ right? Does 
somebody want to go, ‘‘Wait. Hold on,’’ 
knock on the door and say: ‘‘Excuse 
me, where do you think the power is 
coming from?’’ Is it magic power? 
‘‘Well, we just get power from elec-
tricity,’’ as if the electricity comes 
from nothing, as if the Tesla is just 
magically powered and suddenly just 
drives around without having abundant 
availability of energy. 
Is the gentleman aware and would he 
agree with me that China has about 70 
percent of the world’s rare-earth re-
serves, and that when we are going 
down the road of solar panels and other 
alternative 
forms 
of 
energy—and, 
again, Texas embraced wind power; 
Texas embraced solar power. We can 
have these as part of our grid, but then 
what happens on a windless, cloudy 
day? You have China being empowered. 
One more question for the gen-
tleman: Is the gentleman aware that 
we just saw a report that China is pro-
ducing more of the emissions and CO2 
than the rest of the world combined? 
My colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle want us to join the Paris Agree-
ment, which we were outperforming 
without being a part of it. They want 
us to bow down to the altar of the Chi-
nese and say: ‘‘Oh, please let us be a 
part of this whole exercise,’’ while 
China is pumping out more actual pol-
lutants and more CO2 than anybody 
else in the world. 
Mr. PERRY. I am aware, and I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for bringing 
it up. 
We keep hearing about getting to 
net-zero, net-zero carbon. What is fas-
cinating is, people don’t realize that we 
could do that. If we actually did that, 
China would eclipse everything that we 
just did by going from our current 
economy to net zero in a few weeks’ 
time, literally a few weeks’ time. So, 
we do all that, take ourselves back to 
essentially the seventh century, and 
China would eclipse it in just a few 
weeks’ time. 
First of all, there are not enough 
critical minerals. There are not enough 
mines on the planet to transfer this en-
ergy economy into a solely wind- and 
solar-powered economy. There is just 
not. 
So, we have to get real about what 
this is. I think the pipeline shutdown 
that you just saw on the East Coast 
here is indicative of how important and 
how tied to energy the vitality of this 
economy is and this America First 
agenda is. Tinkering with it even just 
the slightest bit has drastic con-
sequences. 
My good friend, the gentleman from 
Texas, endured it. All of Texas endured 
it this past winter. Their power got 
shut off, and the backup power for 
them, for their wind and solar grid, was 
natural 
gas 
pumps. 
Unfortunately, 
they are electric-powered, and the rea-
son they chose electricity to power 
their backup pumps is to come below 
the emissions standards. Well, guess 
what? When your electricity is off be-
cause the Sun is not shining and the 
wind is not blowing and everything is 
frozen up, the electric pump doesn’t 
work either. 
This is insanity. We are choosing 
this. We are doing this by design. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware 
that human life expectancy, if you 
track it on a chart, is almost directly 
correlated to the availability of abun-
dant energy and that we have seen the 
lifesaving advances that cause human 
flourishing, the ability to save people’s 
lives, the advancement of modern tech-
nology for medicine, to be able to 
spread that around the world? 
There are still 3 billion people in the 
world right now who are not living 
with abundant energy, and what do we 
want to do as the greatest country in 
the history of the world? We want to 
slam the brakes on this great economy 
with this magic unicorn dust of a view 
toward how we are going to have our 
energy policy while we throttle us 
back, empower China, allow China to 
be able to continue to pollute what 
they want to in the atmosphere. Mean-
while, human beings suffer. 
Mr. PERRY. It is not only just allow-
ing China to pollute at an unprece-
dented level. Maybe for people who 
don’t like colonialism and think that 
America throws its weight around too 
much, maybe that is China’s business, 
trying to lift their impoverished people 
out of poverty and give them power. As 
you said, not just hundreds of lives, not 
just hundreds of thousands of lives, but 
literally millions of lives will be saved 
with power. 
But what is the insult upon the in-
jury is the Paris climate accord, where 
we actually pay China, which takes 
your tax dollars to take your energy 
away and pay them so that they can 
pollute even more while you can’t live 
in the First World, in the 21st century. 
That is the insult upon injury here. 
Mr. ROY. I heard the gentleman, who 
I should thank for his military service, 
his long career in serving in our Armed 
Forces. I appreciate your service. I 
know the gentleman is concerned a lot 
about national security, as well. 
With respect to pipelines, you alluded 
to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. I believe 
today we learned that the administra-
tion was backing away from sanctions,

which is perfectly fine, having the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline funneling all sorts of 
fossil fuels to Germany, but forsaking 
our friends in Ukraine, by the way, in 
doing so. 
You get a twofer out of this adminis-
tration: undermine our national secu-
rity while harming our friends in 
Ukraine who are trying to push back 
against Putin. But, oh, by the way, you 
are advancing a pipeline over there 
while you refuse to have pipelines in 
the United States of America. 
Mr. PERRY. Yes. The gentleman 
probably knows this, but Pennsylvania, 
of course, a great energy State, has 
been for a long time—Titusville, you 
know the Drake Well and so on and so 
forth, it goes back a long time for us. 
We can’t get our natural gas to market 
in New England because we can’t get a 
pipeline through. They won’t allow it. 
So, where does New England get its 
natural gas in the wintertime when 
times are tough? They buy it from Rus-
sia. Talk about a national security 
issue. Again, more insult to injury. 
None of this is based on an America 
First agenda. It is almost like every-
body else other than America is first. 
These are political leaders and policy-
makers elected by their American con-
stituency. You would think that they 
would want to support that constitu-
ency first, do what is best for them, 
ease their concerns when they have to 
make the bills, pay the mortgage or 
the gas bill, or pay for their child’s 
education. And the prices just keep 
going up because of decisions that are 
made based on politics, not based on ef-
ficacy and what is good for people in 
America. 
Mr. ROY. I know the gentleman prob-
ably has things he needs to do, but be-
fore he leaves, I wanted to address one 
other issue on national security be-
cause I know he has a passion for this, 
as well. 
We have talked about the impact on 
our economy of America First versus 
America last. We talked about the im-
pact on the border of America First 
versus America last. We talked about 
the impact on energy and availability 
of energy of America First versus 
America last. 
Now, let’s talk a little bit about the 
impact on the stability in the world on 
Middle East peace, on our national se-
curity and the national security of our 
friends and allies, and, in particular, 
our friends in Israel. 
I know the gentleman, like I, has 
traveled to Israel. I have been there a 
couple of times. I am sure the gen-
tleman has been there a few times. In 
my experience in Israel, it is an ex-
traordinary place with extraordinary 
people with a pluralistic culture, a 
multifaith culture. But it is a bur-
geoning democracy, a strong economy, 
and it is probably our strongest ally in 
the world—if not in the world, cer-
tainly in the Middle East. The previous 
administration was doing what for dec-
ades previous administrations had said 
was impossible and was striking his-
toric peace deals with Arab nations, 
working and interacting with Israel, 
with direct flights from Arab nations 
to Israel occurring. The Abraham Ac-
cords, we had significant peace in the 
Middle East, yet what do we have 
today? In a few short months under the 
wisdom of the current administration, 
we have massive attacks on our friends 
in Israel. 
b 1945 
We have massive loss of life. And God 
bless the previous relationships with 
our country and Israel to produce the 
technology that Iron Dome offers to 
the people of Israel so that they are 
not getting slaughtered by the rockets 
that are coming from Hamas, being 
supported, by the way, by the policies 
of this administration, in empowering 
Hamas to be taking shots at our 
friends in Israel, where our friends in 
Israel are under attack. 
Thank the good Lord above that we 
have Iron Dome and the ability to pro-
tect our friends in Israel and work with 
them so that we also have strong mis-
sile defense technology. 
Would the gentleman agree that that 
is the current state of affairs? 
Mr. PERRY. This is one of the sad-
dest things we have seen in the few 
short months of this administration. 
The change of the Abraham Accords 
and the lowering of tensions in the 
Middle East between these nations and 
the resolve to be peaceful. The great 
track that we were on in just a few 
short months, it goes from that picture 
to the picture with the rockets being 
sent to Israel. Of course, being deliv-
ered—the explosives being delivered by 
the technology produced in Iran, by the 
avowed enemy of Israel, Hamas, who 
seeks not to find some resolution, but 
seeks death. 
It is in their charter. So if you don’t 
like what I am saying, I am just a mes-
senger. It is in their charter that their 
job is to kill every single Jew. That is 
what they seek to do, in just a few 
short months. Everyone knew and ev-
eryone knows every administration 
will be tested by these foreign adver-
saries, and this one is being tested 
right now. And, of course, in my opin-
ion, and obviously from the photo-
graphs, they are failing this test. 
Is the gentleman aware that there is 
a proposal potentially coming to stop 
the sale of armament to Israel to 
rearm their missile defense system? 
Mr. ROY. I saw the same stories that 
my 
friend 
from 
Pennsylvania 
saw 
about some of our democratic col-
leagues, I think here in the House and 
in the Senate, who were starting to say 
that we needed to back off of that and 
not provide the hellfire missiles or any 
of the resources that we worked in col-
laboration with our friends in Israel in 
order to make sure they are protected, 
and particularly in the use of the Iron 
Dome. Literally protecting millions of 
people, by the way. 
There is 150,000 rockets sitting in 
Lebanon, sitting and pointing right at 
northern Israel. By the way, the popu-
lated area in that northern part of 
Israel is about the size of a portion of 
the district I represent in that stretch 
between San Antonio and Austin. 
I took a helicopter tour going up to 
Jordan, up the north side of Israel, 
back down to Tel Aviv and back down 
to Jerusalem in a few hours. 
Can you imagine? That is the size of 
Israel. 
And they have 150,000 rockets in Leb-
anon pointing from the north, and they 
have got Gaza over here firing all these 
missiles coming in from Gaza. Hamas 
launching them in at Israel, and they 
are actually benefiting from the tech-
nology we are providing. And now you 
have got Democrats saying they want 
to pull that away. 
Now, the good news is I also saw a 
story today with a couple of them 
starting to walk that back, because 
hopefully they are starting to feel the 
pressure the American people want us 
to stand with Israel. The American 
people want us to stand with our allies 
who stand with us, and that is what 
Israel has done. 
And I would tell the gentleman, I am 
sure he has experienced what I experi-
enced when I was at the Sea of Galilee. 
And I was on the floor the other night 
with BRIAN MAST, your fellow veteran, 
who lost his legs in service to our coun-
try. He also served 2 years in the Israel 
Defense Forces. Well, Brian and I were 
both sharing the story about when we 
were sitting on a pier in the Sea of Gal-
ilee, and the Israelis, who were on that 
pier, stood up and looked at us and 
they all sang ‘‘God Bless America.’’ 
And they all stood up and thanked us 
one by one for what we do in defense of 
Israel and our partnership with them. 
And this administration is walking 
away from that. This administration is 
hugging 
Iran. 
This 
administration 
wants to cut deals with Iran, provide 
resources to Hamas in the Gaza Strip, 
which undermines Israel and under-
mines our national security. And the 
American people, when they know this, 
they don’t want it. 
Mr. PERRY. I will close with this, as 
I am sure the gentleman has much 
more he would like to talk about, and 
I have kind of interrupted him here a 
little bit. 
Mr. ROY. It has been great. 
Mr. PERRY. But I’ve so appreciated 
his work. 
Our relationship with Israel is much 
closer than just friendship. We depend 
on one another in so many ways that 
are unseen and unknown. And just one 
thing that had crossed my mind on 
many occasions—when you fly the 
most lethal attack helicopter in the 
world, the AH–64 Apache—— 
Mr. ROY. You know something about 
that? 
Mr. PERRY. You have a helmet sys-
tem that is linked to the camera sys-
tem, linked to the gun, that the place-
ment of your head is followed by those 
cameras so you can fly the aircraft, is 
followed by that weapon system so

that you can defend yourself at a mo-
ment’s notice at all times. 
And that following that is done with 
that helmet—which is very expensive— 
is made by our friends in Israel, be-
cause we are together. 
Now, what breaks my heart, among 
other things, is that there are people 
right in this body—I mean, I hate to 
say it—they might as well be called the 
Hamas Caucus. 
And I shudder to say that, especially 
in terms of what I just said Hamas 
stands for: The death of every single 
Jew in Israel. That is what they stand 
for, by their own accord, by their own 
account. That we would have people in 
this body say that Israel is an apart-
heid government and we should be sup-
porting Hamas and what is happening, 
what they are doing sending these mu-
nitions over. It is an insult. 
Arabs in Israel are the freest Arabs 
in that part of the world. They serve in 
government. They have their own po-
litical parties. They have their own 
free speech in Israel. It is an insult. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware 
that a few of our colleagues actually 
were lamenting that Iron Dome was 
preventing casualties in Israel because, 
for some reason, that might be seen as 
disproportionate with respect to what-
ever damage and casualties might be 
occurring in Gaza? 
And it seemed to me that the simple 
answer—I mean, just color me crazy 
here, my friend from Pennsylvania— 
might be stop firing rockets from Gaza, 
stop firing rockets at Israel. 
Would the gentleman also agree that 
our friends in Israel, the Israelis, call 
ahead, give them notice, tell them the 
missiles are coming in? 
They say, ‘‘vacate the block because 
in 15 minutes that building is going to 
be gone.’’ 
And then we heard our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle lamenting 
that somehow AP or Al Jazeera were in 
a building that was taken out. 
Yet there is ample evidence that they 
knew full well that Hamas was oper-
ating in that building. They knew it, 
yet they were doing it anyway and 
they didn’t care. 
Mr. PERRY. Is the gentleman from 
Texas aware that Hamas routinely lo-
cates their firing batteries, their muni-
tion stocks in schools, in populated 
areas with civilians, and fire from 
those locations for multiple purposes, 
propaganda purposes? 
That is the depth of depravity where 
they would use small children as props, 
even to have them killed in a response 
as Israel defends itself. This is all a re-
sponse to an attack. 
Mr. ROY. Does the gentleman agree 
that Israel not only has a right to de-
fend itself—and I was thankful to hear 
the President at least utter those 
words, that they have a right to defend 
themselves. 
Does he not agree with me that they 
have a duty, a responsibility to defend 
themselves in the same way that we 
would if 1,500—well, actually, up to 
3,300 rockets have been launched by 
Hamas in the last 8 days. 
Can you imagine what the American 
people will be saying and doing if I was 
sitting in San Antonio or Austin and 
3,300 rockets were coming at us from 
Nuevo Laredo, from across the border 
in Mexico? 
Would we just be sitting back and 
saying, well, I mean, I wonder what 
kind of proportionate response should 
look like? 
Or would you just be responding back 
with overwhelming force to say under 
no circumstances do you shoot one 
rocket into our country, much less 
3,300? 
Mr. PERRY. That is the fundamental 
duty of those who take the oath of the 
Constitution: Defense. Defense of your 
Nation. Defense of this liberty. 
And it can’t be defended if it is under 
attack from a foreign nation. So, abso-
lutely, Israel has the right to defend 
itself and to respond to attacks. 
Again, it is abhorrent and completely 
insulting to refer to it as they do, and 
to take the side of the aggressor in this 
regard and say that, well, the response 
is disproportionate. 
What is the proportionate response 
when your innocent family is killed 
under the barrage of an unwarranted 
unprovoked missile attack from across 
the closed border? What is the appro-
priate response? 
If it were your family, I guarantee 
you, I would want a very robust re-
sponse to stop,—to stop the missiles 
coming in. 
Mr. ROY. The gentleman is welcome 
to stay as long as he wants, but I think 
he has other places to go. But I would 
just say that I appreciate the gen-
tleman joining me. 
I know he agrees with me that an 
‘‘America first’’ agenda that is pro- 
jobs, pro-affordable prices, pro-border 
security, pro-Israel, pro-national secu-
rity, pro-abundant energy is much bet-
ter than an ‘‘America last’’ agenda in 
which we abandon our own allies, aban-
don our own national security, have 
wide open borders, have skyrocketing 
prices, inflation going through the 
roof, and joblessness because people 
can’t find jobs, because people are get-
ting paid more not to work than to 
work. 
Mr. PERRY. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania does completely agree, 
and I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I would close a lit-
tle bit here out on Israel by saying just 
a few things I didn’t get into in terms 
of the details, because these matters. 
These details matter. 
I said before, in the last 8 days, 
Hamas has launched more than 3,300 
rockets at our friends in Israel. Think 
about that. We have had 10 people in 
Israel 
been 
killed—both 
Jews 
and 
Arabs. 
I read a story of a young Indian 
woman, who was visiting Israel, who 
also lost her life. 
Iron Dome has intercepted 90 percent 
of the rockets. Hamas is trying to over-
whelm the defense system and destroy 
Israel. 
Madam Speaker, 70 percent of Israel 
civilians have run into a bomb shelter 
this week. Parents and children were 
being woken up in the middle the night 
by sirens alerting them that they have 
90 seconds to get inside a bomb shelter. 
We had Esther Schlesinger huddled 
with her 1-year-old son on Tuesday. 
When speaking about the event, Esther 
said: I didn’t have time to grab any-
thing. I didn’t have time to grab my 
phone. We just ran into the shelter and 
kept hearing explosion after explosion. 
I feel terrible for these parents who 
have to try and explain what is going 
on. I literally was holding my son in 
the bomb shelter, and I am thinking I 
am grateful he isn’t old enough to un-
derstand why I had to quickly grab 
him. Despite all this, I don’t doubt my 
decision to live here. Even in these 
crazy times. It is so important for me 
to be here as a Jew. 
Madam Speaker, we are seeing the 
result of a failed policy of this adminis-
tration. When you think about it, 
President Trump called Prime Minister 
Netanyahu 2 days after his inaugura-
tion. The current President took over a 
month to call the Prime Minister of 
Israel—arguably, our closest ally in the 
world, certainly our closest ally in the 
Middle East. 
When asked, President Biden’s sec-
retary couldn’t even say whether Israel 
remains, ‘‘important ally of the United 
States.’’ 
The 
Biden 
administration 
has 
emboldened Iran, the number one state 
sponsor of terrorism, dedicated to the 
destruction of Israel in the United 
States, by restarting negotiations on 
the failed 2015 Iran nuclear deal. They 
rewarded the PA by restoring millions 
of dollars in funding to the West Bank 
in Gaza; undermined Israel and inter-
national organizations by restoring 
$150 million in funding to the UNRWA 
and rejoining the Israel-hating United 
Nations Human Rights Council without 
much-needed reforms. 
It is one hit after another, one punch 
to the gut after another to our friends 
in Israel, while we are funding Hamas 
and their ability to fire rockets at our 
friends in Israel. This is a pattern. 
I will just tell my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, to ask yourself 
a question for the American people who 
are watching all of this: Do you want 
America to be first? Or do you want 
America to be last? 
Because the current administration, 
the current policies of this body, the 
current policies of the Senate are tak-
ing us down a road which we had long 
since left behind in the days of the Car-
ter era, in the late 1970s, when you had 
long lines at the gas pump, sky-
rocketing gas prices, inability to get 
jobs, stagflation, inflationary pres-
sures. 
Most people today don’t really re-
member. I remember when my parents

got their mortgage rate down from 14 
percent, 12 percent, 10 percent—man, 
when they got to single digits. Today, 
those rates have been hovering around 
3 percent. 
People don’t understand what they 
are facing, and they are going to see it 
soon, as they are seeing these prices 
skyrocket and they can’t afford houses 
and they can’t afford gas and they 
can’t afford basic commodities and 
goods and services, and they can’t hire 
people, and their small businesses are 
going out of business because of the 
policies of this administration. 
America first. People have jobs, busi-
nesses thrive, gas is affordable, housing 
is affordable, our border is becoming 
secure. A border, by the way, that still 
allowed people to legally migrate to 
our country, but to do so in a much 
safer way; without empowering cartels 
to be able to move human beings for 
profit, put them into the sex traf-
ficking trade, the human trafficking 
trade, make millions of dollars in the 
process. 
America first is putting our friends 
in Israel first and standing alongside 
them for their interest, yes, but also 
for our national security interest. 
b 2000 
One or two more thoughts on the bor-
der because it has hit so close to home 
in the State of Texas, which I rep-
resent. 
Now, I have taken multiple trips to 
the border, and I have spoken about it 
many times on this floor and else-
where. But it is not just some esoteric 
concept that doesn’t impact our whole 
country, but it certainly impacts Texas 
very directly. 
I said we had 178,000 migrants appre-
hended in April, we are now over 600,000 
for the calendar year, 300,000 that have 
been released or got-aways that have 
gotten into our country. Those are real 
numbers, they are published numbers. 
Some of them are—the got-away num-
bers are numbers you get when you 
talk to people who know what is going 
on who work in DHS or work down at 
the border. 
April’s CBP’s numbers show more 
fentanyl seized in the first 5 months in 
2021 than in all of 2020. Fentanyl is a 
dangerous narcotic. Do we not care? I 
mean, it is a legitimate question. Do 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, do they literally not care? I have 
never once heard one of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle address 
this issue, not once. 
I put something out on social media 
the other day telling the Vice Presi-
dent that I would be happy to meet her 
anywhere, anytime, to debate the issue 
of border security. She is allegedly in 
charge of it. Well, Madam Vice Presi-
dent, I am here on the floor of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives, Article I in the Constitution; you 
are now serving in Article II as the 
Vice President, with a foot over in the 
Article I Senate as President. I am 
happy to debate anytime, anywhere, 
the status of the border of the United 
States, and how it is endangering 
American citizens, endangering ranch-
ers, endangering border patrol, endan-
gering law enforcement officers, endan-
gering Texans, allowing fentanyl and 
dangerous narcotics to flow into our 
communities, empowering the sex traf-
ficking trade and the human traf-
ficking trade, and empowering cartels 
to be able to carry out their heinous 
activities. 
They just uncovered a burial pit just 
across the Rio Grande, where these 
dangerous cartels bury people that 
they murder. Stories of people being 
locked into bars, chained doors, and 
the building lit on fire, people being 
hung from bridges, people being burned 
alive. This is all happening literally 
across the Rio Grande, and we are em-
powering it. We are empowering it with 
an America-last agenda where cartels 
are empowered, our borders are run by 
cartels, human beings are mistreated 
in the name of compassion. 
The American people are tired of all 
of the swamp drama. That is all we get 
here is swamp trauma, every single 
day. We have more conversations about 
splitting us up by race. We have more 
conversations about January 6 com-
missions. We have more conversations 
about masks or not masks. Meanwhile, 
the American people are hurting. 
The American people can’t hire peo-
ple. The American people are dealing 
with wide open borders. The America 
people can’t afford goods and services. 
The American people can’t have their 
kids in schools without worrying about 
what is happening to their kids. All of 
the videos we are now seeing pop up 
with 
children 
testifying 
at 
school 
board hearings, saying, I have been 
spending a year wearing a mask, and I 
have been being yelled at, and I have 
been beat up because I am being told, 
you know, I got to wear a mask, and 
shut my ability to see people. I want to 
see people’s faces. What are we doing to 
our children? We are decimating a gen-
eration of Americans. 
The American people are tired of 
this. We spent $6 trillion in the last 
year, you can’t really make it up. What 
are we doing? I mean, with all due re-
spect to the Speaker, Speaker PELOSI, 
and the majority leader, and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
What are we doing? We are destroying 
the American economy. We are killing 
small businesses. We are destroying 
our own dollar, our own economy. We 
are driving up the prices of goods and 
services. We are preventing people 
from being able to hire people. We are 
scaring the heck out of our children. 
We are allowing our schools to shut 
them down and not teach them. We are 
siding with our enemies in Iran instead 
of our friends in Israel. We are allowing 
wide open borders to endanger our peo-
ple with fentanyl. We are empowering 
cartels. 
How on Earth is the people’s House 
allowing this to happen to the United 
States of America? The American peo-
ple have had it. The American people 
want sanity, they don’t want us talk-
ing about tweets and talking about all 
the drama in this town and what posi-
tions people have or don’t have. They 
just want us to lead. They just want us 
to come into this body and not be here, 
like I am right now, by myself, with all 
due respect to the Madam Speaker, but 
by myself addressing an empty Cham-
ber. 
This is what debate has been reduced 
to, and I have talked about that before, 
but I will keep talking about it. This is 
what debate has been reduced to. I 
chastised the majority leader earlier 
today because we were talking about a 
bill that was labeled a hate crimes pre-
vention bill that came over from the 
Senate, and the majority leader said: 
Well, if you are for this bill, you are 
against hate; if you are against this 
bill, you are for hate. And that is how 
that is going to be seen. 
And I told the majority leader, I said, 
that is the problem. I mean, do you 
really believe that is true? That if I 
have 
a 
different 
view 
about 
how 
divvying us up by race is a bad idea and 
how categorizing us in categories of 
race, 
and 
then 
creating 
thought 
crimes, and having government going 
around and policing our thoughts and 
go tracking us down, based on what we 
say or do, as opposed to: Hey, you com-
mitted a crime. But if I vote against 
the bill, oh, I am for hate. That is what 
we have reduced this body to. 
And, again, I get it, these are polit-
ical slogans to my left and right, right? 
There is a purpose to this. There is a 
purpose to me putting this up, and say-
ing, American first versus America 
last. Okay. I would love it if we could 
sit here in this Chamber, and say, you 
know what, maybe spending $6 trillion 
is a bad idea. 
Why don’t we rewind some of those 
dollars and see if we can tone down 
that inflation? Why don’t we tighten 
our belt a little bit. Why don’t we get 
the dollars flowing in for unemploy-
ment that is crippling the ability of 
businesses to hire people? Why don’t 
we pull that back a little bit? Why 
don’t we just sit down at a table, roll 
our sleeves up, and figure out how to 
make it work? 
Why don’t we say, Hey, wide open 
borders being run by cartels is a bad 
idea. Let’s figure out how to secure the 
borders. We are a sovereign Nation, 
that is not a crazy thought. Why don’t 
we say, Hey, what are we getting out of 
our relationship with Israel and peace 
in the Middle East, and standing side 
by side, and the strength that that 
makes for our country and for them. 
Madam Speaker, I am nearing the 
end of my time, and I have a colleague 
over here that I believe is going to 
have a few thoughts to share, and so I 
will wind down here in the next couple 
of minutes. I will alert my friend. 
But I would just say, you know—first 
of all, let me just say, I appreciate the 
staff who are down here and keep this 
place running, and you have to sit

here, and the stenographer is writing 
everything down that we are saying 
and, you know, the clerks that keep ev-
erything going. You are here because 
we are here, and I appreciate it. As a 
former staffer myself, we very much 
appreciate you all being here. 
It is an honor to serve in this body, 
but it is an honor because of what we 
need to achieve, not what we are doing. 
It is an honor to serve in the House of 
Representatives because of where this 
country can go, where it needs to go on 
behalf of its citizenry, not because of 
what we are doing today. Because what 
we are doing today is undermining the 
health of this Republic. 
I will just close by saying that one of 
the things that I have been talking to 
my constituents about when I go home 
is asking the very simple question: Are 
we free? Are we actually free? Are we 
free if we have $30 trillion of debt and 
we are undermining our economy? Are 
we free if people can’t hire people in 
their small businesses in order to sur-
vive? 
Are we free if we have open borders 
that are being run by cartels? Are we 
free if we are not standing with our al-
lies, but instead, we are standing with 
some of our enemies? Are we free if 
China controls much of our supply 
chains? Are we free if the unborn never 
get a shot at life? Are we free if our 
children are being taught that America 
is evil in the schools? 
I would argue that we are not as free 
as we ought to be. We are not as free as 
we need to be. And that we are not as 
free as is necessary to ensure that our 
kids and grandkids can inherit this 
great birthright of being an American 
citizen. I believe we should put Amer-
ica first. I do not believe that we 
should have America in last place. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
THE DIRE SITUATION IN THE 
KLAMATH BASIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to stand up here with my 
friend and colleague, Representative 
CLIFF BENTZ of Oregon, as we both go 
over in detail the dire situation cur-
rently happening in the Klamath Basin 
in the area bordering northern Cali-
fornia and southern Oregon here, upper 
Klamath Lake. 
So this has been an ongoing problem 
over several decades, really. In March 
of this year, the Bureau of Reclama-
tion, which oversees the water in the 
Klamath Project promised that the 
growers there in the basin would re-
ceive 130,000 acre feet of water. This on 
the heels of 2020 with a similar situa-
tion where the Bureau promised water 
to the growers in the amount of 140,000 
acre feet. 
Now, this is of a total of a true water 
right of 390,000 acre feet that is prom-
ised in the basin for the project. These 
are already big cuts to what the origi-
nal project intent was, with 390,000 acre 
feet, and the amount that these folks 
have endured in cuts in recent years. 
So when they made that initial 
March allocation, the Bureau followed 
up in April, cutting that figure another 
70 percent. Remember, 390,000 acre feet 
cut to 130,000. In April, they cut, addi-
tionally, 70 percent more down to 33,000 
acre feet. So that is 8 percent of the 
water the irrigators would have been 
promised initially. 
Last week, another cut was made, 
now down to just 3,000 acre feet. An 
acre foot, for those scoring at home, is 
about 326,000 gallons, or the amount of 
water it takes to cover 1 acre with a 
foot of water. 
At that point, the 3,000-acre delivery, 
the Bureau has decided, is not worth 
the effort to deliver into the district 
into the canals, et cetera. 
So basically what this means, in 2021, 
no water would flow to the Klamath 
Project, this is for the first time since 
1907, the headgates of the A Canal 
would remain closed. 
b 2015 
From June 1907 to May 2021, some 
amount of water has always flowed 
into the Klamath project. From the 
upper lake here to the A canal. I will 
show you more pictures later, Madam 
Speaker, on how the A canal works to 
feed much of the district. 
This area, of course, is populated by 
Tribes, descendants of pioneers, fron-
tiersmen, and veterans of World War I 
and World War II who quite literally 
won a lottery to homestead in the foot-
print of Lake Modoc. 
The 
water 
hasn’t 
always 
been 
enough, 
and 
a 
mountain 
of 
unpleasantries have been shared over 
the allocation of this resource, but 
there has always been water at least. 
So, I would like to start the con-
versation on the Klamath going back 
to the fundamental water rights. The 
first private ditch in the basin was dug 
in 1868, and the few irrigation projects 
that were there at the time were quite 
small. In 1882, the first bit of land with-
in the current project was irrigated. 
Authorized by Congress in 1905, it is 
the second oldest project in the West. 
There are several hundred miles of 
main canals, lateral canals, and drain-
age ditches, and 200,000 acres of irri-
gated farmland across 1,400 farms. Ex-
cuse me, 27,000 irrigable land in the 
lower Klamath, and to the Lake Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge. 
Today, it is over $200,000 worth of 
value in alfalfa, hay, wheat, and pota-
toes, including the ones you would get 
at In-N-Out Burger french fries as well 
as pasture. 
In 1917, the rock sill between Upper 
Klamath Lake and the Link River was 
lowered allowing more flows to agri-
culture areas and downstream basins. 
In 1921, the Link River Dam was com-
pleted allowing water to be retained 
during spring peaks and increasing the 
total amount of water in the lake. 
After nearly 50 years of construction, 
the final piece of the project was com-
pleted in 1964 with the Iron Gate Dam 
along the Klamath River, one of four 
dams that are providing hydroelectric 
power and are currently in peril, too, 
due to a fish passage issue. 
In total, the project allows for nearly 
600,000 acre-feet of water to be stored. 
So the Bureau of Reclamation has 
been making an incorrect claim for 
quite a while to the Klamath project 
water. They have been involved, of 
course, since Congress authorized the 
project in 1905. Every year, the farmers 
in the basin spend about $30 million to 
maintain this project, paying the gov-
ernment for that. 
The Bureau has acted and operated 
the project and the head works of the 
irrigation systems. In 1970 and 1973, 
Congress passed the National Environ-
mental Policy Act, known as NEPA, 
and the Endangered Species Act, both 
well-intended. This legislation effec-
tively requires, according to interpre-
tation, the bureau to prioritize the en-
vironment over the well-being and eco-
nomic security of humans. That is not 
the original intent of Congress. This is 
what courts have ruled over the years. 
So the fish involved in the current 
issues are several species. The Lost 
River sucker fish and the shortnose 
sucker only exist in the Upper Klamath 
Lake. From 1984 to 1986, the sucker 
population began a steep decline head-
ing to their listing as endangered in 
1988. 
The biological opinions which heav-
ily influence water decisions and allo-
cations coming out of the Upper Klam-
ath Lake are the results of Interior at-
torneys—longtime career attorneys— 
here in Washington, D.C. So the recent 
biological opinions put out in the end 
of the Trump administration were 
partly 
responsible 
for 
setting 
the 
record straight and helping last year to 
get a little bit more water to the farm-
ers, as we had to rescue that situation 
in May in order to have their alloca-
tion kept at 140,000. 
So when the Lost River sucker was 
listed, two Klamath scholars actually 
noted that no one seems to anticipate 
that the listing of the sucker fish 
might have serious impacts on the op-
eration of Klamath Project, which the 
impacts economically to people are re-
quired as originally part of the Endan-
gered Species Act. That has all seemed 
to have gone out the window. 
Coho salmon is the other population 
of fish native to the Klamath basin and 
adjacent rivers and rivers all up and 
down the West Coast. Salmon popu-
lations have followed a general trend of 
decline that is seen all across the Pa-
cific Coast. 
With all these populations, they are 
not just in the Klamath River, so year 
after year, extra water flows down the 
Klamath River have been used to deal 
with what is known as the C. shasta 
virus. 
Now, there is a lot of debate whether 
these flows are actually effective or

not. There are counter opinions that 
keeping the river wet and all these 
flushes actually help propagate the 
virus instead of drying it out and mak-
ing the virus dry out basically on the 
vine. 
Then there is a similar debate with 
the sucker fish in the lake that a high 
level of water in the lake will cause 
them to be more subject to predators 
in the lake where the lower level, since 
they are bottom feeder fish and it is 
less conducive for the atmosphere for 
the predators of those fish. 
So it is seemingly going in opposite 
directions. But we also have counter 
purposes for the Federal agencies that 
are regulating right now, Fish and 
Game, Fish and Wildlife, that are try-
ing to preserve the deep lake for the 
sucker and at the same time they want 
to have the flows go down the river to 
take care of the C. shasta virus for the 
salmon—you can’t do both—as well as 
have any water available for agri-
culture, for the communities, and for 
the refuges for the wildlife. 
So the irrigators despite their receiv-
ing no water, the Bureau still plans to 
send 375,000 acre-feet downstream for 
salmon. 
Now, let’s get to what the water 
rights look like. In 1975, shortly after 
NEPA and the Endangered Species Act 
went into effect, the Oregon Water Re-
sources Department began the process 
of detailing and adjudicating the water 
rights of irrigators. Under Oregon law 
Chapter 539, it lays out the process of 
determining water rights before 1909, 
when the water rights code in Oregon 
was initiated, and a large part of this is 
on the Oregon side of the lake. 
This process culminated in the 2013 
Findings of Fact and Order of Deter-
mination, which were then amended in 
2014. Oregon water laws uphold the 
rights of the irrigators and distributes 
water based on the seniority of the 
claim. 
So what are the ramifications for 
failing to deliver the water? 
Now, there is still work to be done in 
reaffirming 
these 
property 
rights, 
which at the time seemed to be iron-
clad, but everything is fudgeable these 
days. So securing the property and 
water rights of the basin will still con-
tinue to be a battle. 
While we continue that fight, we 
must highlight the dire straits of the 
basin today without water. The canals, 
the ditches, and the irrigation districts 
are drying up. This will cause perma-
nent damage to the ditches and the ir-
rigation system there. Basically it is 
kind of like a wooden boat. They need 
to be gotten wet, each irrigation sys-
tem. Also, the groundwater recharges 
provide for the people and the nearby 
neighbors with their domestic wells. 
Every year the project goes dry or 
loses water the costs of returning to 
standard operations will increase. As I 
mentioned with the canals coming 
apart, the first water that needs to go 
in them is actually absorbed by the ca-
nals to get them back into shape. 
So when I mention the 3,000 acre-feet 
that are cut down to and the Bureau 
decided that is not even worth deliv-
ering, at least that could be positively 
used, to some extent, for those sys-
tems, as well as I mentioned the 
groundwater damage without the re-
charge. 
So, most of the basin has to plan and 
plant, based on what the Bureau tells 
them in April will be their allocation. 
For example, one grower there, a fellow 
named Scotty Fenters, notes that the 
panic set in when the Bureau revised 
down their allocation last year in May 
2020. He had already bought seed, al-
ready paid the rent, and already put 
the fertilizer in fields. 
Can you imagine, you have some-
thing halfway done and committed, 
and they say, No, you are not going to 
have the inputs anymore to finish? 
So in total, about $75 million had 
been spent planning and preparing. 
Now, last year again in 2020 after the 
Bureau initially reduced their alloca-
tion, the basin community rallied. 
There was a convoy of tractors and 
trucks that stretched 30 miles to say, 
You have to keep your word, Federal 
Government. 
So, indeed, it was an impressive turn-
out. 
So we come back to the water rights 
being upheld. 
Last year, Klamath irrigation took 
the Bureau of Reclamation to court 
over its decision to increase down-
stream flows for salmon in the Klam-
ath River. The State ultimately agreed 
with KID stating that the Bureau had 
the right to store water in the Upper 
Klamath Lake, but it does not own 
that water. It only has the right to 
move the water on behalf of the grow-
ers and the intent of the project. They 
do not have the right to take the water 
for salmon or suckers—salmon in the 
rivers and suckers in the lake. 
Madam Speaker, may I ask how 
much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 17 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Now, there is still 
much ground we need to cover here to-
night, but I think I have set the table 
for what we are looking at and the dev-
astation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) for his 
presentation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman LAMALFA for his years of 
work on the extraordinary problems in 
the Klamath. 
Let me, again, by talking briefly 
about drought and what it means. I se-
lect this as a starting place because 
many out here in the East have the op-
posite problem—too much water. 
Sadly, to those of us in the West, the 
term drought is all too familiar. We 
know what the word means because we 
have lived in drought conditions for 
years. Drought means no water. It 
means bankruptcy. It means catas-
trophe. It means the death of trees, 
plants, animals, and dreams. In antici-
pation of drought, out in the West, we 
have developed means of surviving 
when droughts occur. We have built 
reservoirs, 
dams, 
canals, 
pipelines, 
drains, wells, and legal systems to deal 
with the supply and allocation, legally 
and practically, of water—this most 
precious, essential, and life-giving re-
source. 
These systems, legal and hydraulic, 
provided the essential and irreplace-
able foundation of communities in the 
West. These laws, and the water di-
vided under them, provided a reliable 
and dependable system upon which fu-
tures 
were 
planned, 
families 
were 
raised, and rural towns with churches, 
schools, 
and 
hospitals 
were 
built. 
Droughts were expected, but Western 
communities 
were 
prepared—or 
at 
least they thought they were. But 
change has come. Change has come in 
the form of the Endangered Species Act 
and in the form of even hotter and 
drier weather. This law and these 
warmer, hotter conditions have upset— 
some would say, destroyed—the sys-
tems that entire communities have re-
lied upon for well over a century. 
Let me be clear: The Endangered 
Species Act is the law, and I am not 
suggesting we break or violate it. Re-
cently, I called for unity in the Klam-
ath basin urging calm and cooperation 
in the face of this incredible and dam-
aging challenge. But if ever there was 
an example of the need to refine and 
better implement the Endangered Spe-
cies Act, what is happening to the 
Klamath basin this year is that reason. 
But it is simply not possible to 
change the way the ESA is imple-
mented in time to help this year. As I 
mentioned, and all of us know, there is 
another thing happening: it is getting 
hotter and drier, and all of our sys-
tems, manmade and natural, are under 
stress—the stress of severe drought and 
an ever-increasing demand for water: 
demand from fish, demand from wild-
life, demand from agriculture, and de-
mand, soon, from rural homes which 
rely on wells for their water. 
What can we do? 
First, we must do our best to tell the 
Nation that some 60 to 70 million peo-
ple across the Western United States 
will be suffering this year from the 
cost and the loss of severe drought. The 
Klamath basin in Oregon and Cali-
fornia unfortunately is the poster child 
for this disaster. 
Secondly, we must call out clearly 
and loudly that our laws, as written 
and enforced, when faced with the 
choice of instream use for ESA pur-
poses on one hand or the community 
on the other, will allocate all of the 
water to instream use, letting other 
needs go begging. 
It must be noted that the water being 
given by the law and the means of en-
forcing it operates to give all of the 
water to the instream interests, even 
though this allocation is in excess of 
that 
which 
would 
have 
naturally 
flowed down the river during summer 
months.

May 18, 2021 
Once again, I want to be clear that 
this allocation of stored water for 
instream purposes is a choice of what 
to save and what to let go. That choice 
has costs—incredible costs. 
Now, it is not my goal today to at-
tack the administration, the Depart-
ment of the Interior, or the Bureau of 
Reclamation. It is my goal to call out 
that this country has, through its gov-
ernment and its laws—the Endangered 
Species Act—made a decision to take 
water from a community and to use it 
for another purpose, placing the burden 
of that choice on people and other less 
fortunate creatures not protected by 
the ESA. 
What is that cost? 
Some have said at least $400 million 
will be lost in the Klamath community 
this year. But that hardly tells the 
story. So let me elaborate. 
The average farmer has mortgage 
payments, property taxes, irrigation 
district assessments, equipment pay-
ments, and most important of all, the 
need to house and take care of his or 
her family. Without water, there are no 
crops, no income, and no ability to pay 
the bills all families have. 
Many producers in the basin have 
supply 
contracts 
that 
they 
have 
worked for years and years to achieve 
and retain. If producers cannot deliver 
on those contracts, for example, with 
Safeway and Whole Foods Market, 
those contracts are lost to other com-
petitors, and many times to other 
countries, such as Mexico, Chile, Aus-
tralia, and Brazil. Oftentimes, these 
contracts can never be recovered. 
Beef and dairy producers lack grass 
for cattle because there has been no 
rain and they cannot irrigate. Hay is in 
short supply and prices for hay have in-
creased dramatically. Beef and dairy 
producers are forced to sell their cattle 
because they cannot afford the cost of 
buying hay. Rebuilding these herds will 
require years and years and much more 
debt. In addition, the increased supply 
of cattle to market causes immediate 
reduction in prices, adding insult to in-
jury. 
Then there are jobs. Thousands of ag-
riculture-related jobs will be lost. Peo-
ple who have been employed in the 
farming area for years will move away, 
and many will never return. 
Then there are farms. This is the sec-
ond consecutive year of what may be 
many years of too little water to meet 
the many needs of the community. As 
the level of uncertainty regarding the 
future becomes ever more pronounced, 
more and more young people raised on 
farms lose faith in the future of farm-
ing and ranching and choose other ca-
reers. The average age of the American 
farmer is now late fifties, and it keeps 
going up. This trend means that we 
will become more and more dependent 
upon foreign countries to sell us food. 
But everyone agrees, in principle, we 
should grow our food here at home. The 
pandemic and more recently the ship-
ping crisis have shown us that a global 
supply chain is not always dependable. 
b 2030 
This choice, along with many others, 
to treat farmers and ranchers as 
though they are expendable, is bad for 
our Nation and bad for our future. 
When we talk about infrastructure, 
let’s not forget that those who know 
how to operate farms and ranches are 
part of the essential infrastructure of 
our Nation. These choices that don’t 
balance the needs of our environment 
and the community are driving food 
production into other countries, put-
ting us all at risk. 
In addition, this drought will create 
and is creating extraordinarily nega-
tive environmental, public health, and 
safety impacts. The waterfowl, reptile, 
and amphibians mentioned by Con-
gressman LAMALFA that rely on our 
canal system, ditch banks, and irri-
gated fields will simply not be there. 
They will die, as there is no water in 
the canals or on the fields for them. 
There have been and will continue to 
be dust storms—think dust bowl. And 
this is no exaggeration. Two national 
wildlife refuges rely exclusively on the 
Klamath Project for water. They will 
receive no water for those wetlands and 
habitats this year. They will dry up. 
The waterfowl that use them will be 
hurt. 
There are 1,800 domestic water wells 
in Oregon within the geographic area 
served by the project. These will be af-
fected. 
The drought comes with another side 
effect, increased wildfire risks. Last 
summer, my district was devastated by 
once-in-a-generation, supposedly, fires 
that burned over a million acres in Or-
egon, destroyed thousands of homes 
and businesses, wiped away two entire 
towns, and killed 11 people. Dry vegeta-
tion and forests, combined with poor 
management, are the perfect storm for 
out-of-control wildfires. Those fires 
will damage the Klamath watersheds, 
making this bad situation worse. 
What can we do? In the short term, 
Representative LAMALFA and I are pro-
posing a $47 million critical aid pack-
age to help those hit hardest by the 
drought in the Klamath. Congressman 
LAMALFA will go through it in more 
detail. 
Long term, we strongly believe there 
are critical legal issues that need to be 
addressed. Farmers in irrigation dis-
tricts have strong objections to the re-
allocation of stored water. Dams and 
reservoirs were built to capture water 
during the wet time of year to have 
water available during the dry time of 
year. We have done that in the Klam-
ath Project, and irrigation districts 
pay for the infrastructure that pro-
vides that storage. But now the govern-
ment is requiring that we direct the re-
lease of stored water away from farms 
to artificially increase the amount and 
flow in the Klamath River. 
During the irrigation season, the 
Klamath Project will be providing 
much more flow in the Klamath River 
than ever would have occurred natu-
rally before the project existed. This is 
a legal problem, and it needs to be ad-
dressed. 
More water storage is needed. A fu-
ture of hotter, drier summers means 
this problem is not going to go away. 
In the Klamath and across the West, 
we need better infrastructure and a 
long-term plan so we have enough 
water for farms, cities, fish, and ref-
uges. As snowpack decreases, and it is, 
water storage is critical, to have a reli-
able 
store 
of 
water 
when 
these 
droughts occur. 
For long-term stability, we need the 
community to come together and fig-
ure out how to escape the zero-sum 
game that gives all the water to one 
use, ignoring others. There are critical 
parties to make this happen, and we 
need support of that work from the 
State, the Federal Government, and 
our community. Agreement can be 
reached. This has been done elsewhere. 
As mentioned earlier, we need to pro-
tect and improve our watersheds. This 
means our forests. Each year, all 
stakeholders face uncertainty and risk. 
This fight over water has fractured the 
Klamath community and will fracture 
others. 
To address these extraordinarily dif-
ficult problems, we must work together 
toward a long-term solution because 
this situation is not sustainable. 
Next year’s weather may well be 
worse than what we are facing now. Ev-
erybody is being harmed. There are no 
winners in this situation. Fish popu-
lations are not recovering; farms are 
not receiving enough water; refuges are 
going dry. 
In the short run, perhaps, we can get 
through this year with the govern-
ment’s help. But in the long run, the 
Klamath community will have to de-
cide what kind of future they want. 
Congressman LAMALFA and I stand 
ready to work with everyone in the 
Klamath Basin to come up with real 
long-term solutions. It is time to sit 
down together and figure this out. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate us being able to team up on 
this dire situation up in our common 
area like that. 
Let me just touch on this part here. 
Going into the wildlife refuge aspect 
and the areas there in the basin that 
have sustained much wildlife and wa-
terfowl over the years, this is 2020, 
when deliveries were already inad-
equate. 
Now, it might be hard to see on cam-
era here, but this is a photo of part of 
the duck kill and the birds that were 
plucked out of the Tule Lake area here. 
You can see some of the dots here that 
indicate dead ducks. 
I volunteered one day to go out and 
help retrieve some of that, to get this 
problem out of the water there. 
They become infested with maggots, 
and they help spread disease and all 
that. So this is what this really looks 
like, the waterfowl that is being dev-
astated up there in 2020, even when it 
had some water. There were 44,000 acre- 
feet delivered then. Sixty thousand wa-
terfowl are estimated to have died in

2020. This year, if zero acre-feet are de-
livered, what is that number going to 
look like? What is that going to mean 
for the fly away? 
This is one duck we managed to res-
cue. They had an operation up there to 
take them back and pluck the live ones 
that were sick and take them to a 
nursery and spiff them up and release 
them once again. That was one small 
positive. Indeed, part of the bill pack-
age that Mr. BENTZ and I will be work-
ing on, we will have funding for that. 
Let’s get down to the bottom line 
here. What do we have that we could be 
doing this year? This chart indicates 
the Klamath Project water, what it 
brings to the table. This is stored 
water from the 4,143 mark here down to 
4,136. This is what mankind can have 
influence over, and actually, it can be 
used for a lot of things. I think a lot 
more of this needs to go back into agri-
culture and be used for the wildlife ref-
uges as well. 
Currently, the lake sits at 4,140. That 
is 307,000 acre-feet of available water, 
down to the level where you can’t con-
trol it anymore. It becomes what they 
call dead pool. 
This is what the suckerfish need here 
in this zone. This is deemed by U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife, the additional 2 feet, 
134,000 acre-feet, as the suckerfish 
number that they want to see. 
So if we look at this total number, 
we still have available, between the 
current level and the 4,138, 173,000 acre- 
feet in this lake that could go right 
now to help keep those canals going, 
whatever agriculture still could use at 
this late date in mid-May, and go into 
the refuges. And it still concedes the 2 
feet of surface water, 134,000 acre-feet, 
to the suckerfish, which is above what 
is really their right as the Klamath 
Project is designed and intended and 
dedicated to agriculture when it was 
built over 100 years ago. 
So, we have 173,000 acre-feet above 
this arbitrary U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
number for suckerfish that we could 
use and put into play. 
Will that happen? It is hard telling. 
It is probably going to take yet more 
litigation up there to back up what the 
Oregon courts have already ruled does 
belong, under the Federal law, to the 
growers, to the project. 
Will we see water going down this A 
canal here, the initial canal coming 
out? I don’t know. 
Do we see it coming through this 
river dam to get to these end needs? 
Who knows. Things have gone a dif-
ferent direction under this administra-
tion right now. 
It is tragic, tragic what is going to be 
happening to the wildlife I showed you, 
to agriculture, to the products that we 
still need. 
In the interim, Mr. BENTZ mentioned 
that. We are going to be introducing 
legislation that has a total package of 
about $57 million: $40 million will help 
to fill in what is going to be lost to ag-
riculture and irrigators there; $2.5 mil-
lion for refuges, which will include the 
botulism assistance for the disease 
that is going to be out there for all the 
dead ducks that are going to happen; 
$2.5 million for residential wells, as 
some of them could be going dry if A 
canal and others are not recharging 
and replenishing the groundwater sup-
ply; $3 million for commercial fisher-
men; $4 million to repair the inevitable 
damage that is going to happen to 
these canals if they don’t get wet like 
my wooden boat analogy; $5 million for 
food aid through USDA and the BIA, 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, for Tribes and 
Tribal governments and their food aid. 
Also, at this same time, the Bureau 
of Reclamation has an expansion and 
construction of a new headquarters in 
Klamath Falls that the growers get the 
bill for in order to get no water this 
year. We are setting aside, in this legis-
lation, the concept that they need a 
new building up there to house who 
knows how many personnel that aren’t 
doing the original goal of the project. 
Madam Speaker, $4.3 million is cur-
rently obligated. This needs to go back 
into the relief of what it is going to 
take to either run the district as it is 
and direct relief. 
Finally, the relief to the farmers 
themselves is not having to make the 
payments to the Bureau of Reclama-
tion that they do every year to help 
pay the bills and keep things going be-
cause they are not getting the water. 
I am proud to offer that legislation 
with Mr. BENTZ and bring the relief 
they need. But wouldn’t it be some-
thing to actually bring them the water 
that is going to be much more sus-
taining for the wildlife, for the infra-
structure, for the domestic wells, for 
agriculture, since everybody watching 
this probably enjoys some of these food 
products, whether it is the french fries, 
the horseradish, the mint, the alfalfa 
that goes for feed for many of the beef 
products. 
There are amazing things that they 
do up there when you tour that area 
and talk to these good people who are 
just trying to do what they have done 
for generations, what they were prom-
ised by the Federal Government, espe-
cially our returning veterans after 
World War I and World War II who were 
given this promise, especially in lieu, 
in some cases, of their after-war bonus 
that they would receive. We need to up-
hold this promise and quit jerking the 
chain on the people of the Klamath 
Basin. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-

State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, do not permit nega-
tivity to triumph over us. Use our Sen-
ators to remind us with their faith and 
works that the best is yet to be. As 
they 
remember 
that Your mighty 
power is at work in our Nation and 
world, may their optimism create a 
contagion of hope. 
Lord, continue to accomplish in our 
lives infinitely more than we request 
or imagine. We exalt You, for You con-
tinue to rescue us. We trust You to 
save us though the storms may rage. 
We pray in Your glorious Name. 
Amen.

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a 
landmark 
report 
from 
the 
Inter-
national Energy Agency says countries 
need to move faster and more aggres-
sively to cut planet-warming pollution. 
That is from the New York Times 
this morning. The International En-
ergy Agency, for the first time, is rec-
ommending specific steps to accom-
plish the drastic cuts in carbon emis-
sions that nearly every developed coun-
try has pledged to achieve. One of the 
principal 
recommendations 
is 
‘‘the 
rapid phase-out of gasoline-powered ve-
hicles.’’ 
It just so happens that this report 
lands on the same day that President 
Biden is in Michigan to celebrate the 
release of a new line of electric pickup 
trucks. As one of the best-selling cars 
in America, replacing gasoline pickups 
with electric pickups could save us 
huge amounts of carbon. 
But we shouldn’t stop there. Trans-
portation still accounts for roughly 
one-third of America’s carbon output. 
There is no way the United States can 
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 
without looking out how Americans 
drive. 
So I have put forward an ambitious, 
comprehensive proposal to accelerate 
our country’s transition to zero-emis-
sion vehicles. We call it Clean Cars for 
America. The goal of that plan is that 
by 2040, all vehicles on the road should 
be clean. The International Energy 
Agency, by the way, recommends the 
world reach that target by 2050. So we 
beat them by 10 years, if this proposal 
goes into effect. 
My plan would help us get there 10 
years ahead of time. It is one of the 
many reasons that President Biden put 
Clean Cars for America at the heart of 
his American Jobs Plan, something I 
hope and expect he will discuss today 
in Michigan. 
I want to thank the Biden adminis-
tration. They have been open to many 
new ideas: the American Competitive 
Innovation Act that we will be debat-
ing today and Clean Cars for America, 
which they have more or less adopted 
in whole and put into their Build Back 
Better plan. 
The benefits would be far-reaching, 
far beyond the subject of climate 
change. For a long time, critics have 
been saying you can’t help the environ-
ment without hurting the economy or 
costing jobs. Not so, it is actually the 
reverse. 
We negotiated the Clean Cars for 
America proposal with the unions, with 
the environmental groups, and with 
the auto companies, and all three are 
onboard. The good news is that Clean 
Cars for America would create tens of 
thousands of good-paying union jobs in 
battery manufacturing, construction, 
and auto making. Through targeted in-
vestments, it would put Americans to 
work all across the country building 
charging stations for a new fleet of 
electric cars. Right now, China leads 
the world in the electric vehicle mar-
ket, overtaking us in 2015. We need to 
take back the initiative and create 
thousands upon thousands of good-pay-
ing jobs as we do. 
I am very glad that the Biden admin-
istration has taken this proposal and 
adopted it. We worked, as I said, long 
and hard, for the first time on a major

environmental proposal to bring our 
friends in the union movement onboard 
so that workers saw that their future— 
a bright future, a prosperous future— 
was with clean energy, that we weren’t 
excluding them but including them. 
That is why, unlike many proposals 
in the past, my Clean Cars for America 
proposal 
unites 
the 
environmental 
community, the labor movement, and 
major automakers. The Sierra Club, 
UAW, Ford, and GM are all supportive. 
Isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that great? 
When you want to get something 
done in Washington, you need to build 
a broad and powerful coalition for sup-
port. That is what we did with Clean 
Cars for America. The Senate and the 
country should prioritize it this year. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, on the Endless 
Frontier Act, last night the Senate 
voted to move forward with the End-
less Frontier Act with a vote of 86 to 
11. It is likely that today the Senate 
will take another step to begin debate 
on the bill. It is my intention to have 
an open, bipartisan amendment proc-
ess. 
The Endless Frontier Act already in-
cludes more than 20 bipartisan amend-
ments from the Commerce Committee, 
under the leadership of Senator CANT-
WELL and Ranking Member WICKER. I 
will expect we will consider several 
more here on the floor of the Senate. 
Later today, I will file a substitute 
amendment that pulls together more 
bipartisan legislation from across Sen-
ate committees into our comprehen-
sive bill that we are now calling the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. 
In addition to Chairwoman CANTWELL 
and Ranking Member WICKER, I want 
to thank Chairman MENENDEZ
and 
Ranking Member RISCH of Foreign Re-
lations; Chairman BROWN and Ranking 
Member TOOMEY of Banking; Chairman 
PETERS and Ranking Member PORTMAN 
of HSGAC; Chairwoman MURRAY and 
Ranking Member BURR of HELP; and 
Chairman DURBIN, Ranking Member 
GRASSLEY, and Senator KLOBUCHAR of 
Judiciary. 
Finally, I want to thank the bipar-
tisan group of Senators working on the 
CHIPS and 5G proposals throughout 
the process—not only Senators CANT-
WELL and WICKER but Senators WAR-
NER, KELLY, CORNYN, COTTON, LEAHY, 
and STABENOW. 
Restoring 
America’s 
competitive 
edge should unite Senators from both 
sides of the aisle. The foundation of the 
past century of American prosperity 
has been our leadership in science, 
technology, and innovation. If we are 
going to win the next century, the 
United States needs to be the one dis-
covering the next groundbreaking tech-
nology. 
We had that opportunity, for in-
stance, with tech, and we lead the 
world because of early investments by 
NSF and DARPA. We have the oppor-
tunity now to set our country on a 
path to outinnovate, outproduce, and 
outcompete the world in emerging in-
dustries of the 21st century, with pro-
found consequences for our economic 
and national security. If we don’t lead 
in science and innovation, we will fall 
way behind. If we don’t lead in science 
and innovation, millions of good-pay-
ing jobs that will be available to this 
generation and the next one will go 
poof—gone. We have no choice. We 
have no choice. 
We have always led, and now we have 
fallen behind. Other countries are in-
vesting more than we are. They are not 
as good at it as we are. They are not as 
innovative as we are. But if they put in 
the dollars and we don’t, woe is us. Woe 
is us. 
So when you ask Americans why 
they are upset and they say: We are not 
sure about our future. We are not sure 
if our children will have better jobs 
than we will. We are not sure that our 
jobs will grow. This is the way to do it. 
This is the key. This unlocks our fu-
ture to a bright, sunny America, the 
way we have always had, but we may 
have lost in the last few years, at least 
to some extent. 
I am so glad that this legislation, 
which we worked so hard on, has bipar-
tisan support. It is a place where we 
can unite America and say we will stay 
No. 1, and we are giving our country, 
our universities, our businesses, our 
workers tools to do it. 
f 
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Next is the EEOC 
CRA. Today, the Senate will vote to 
overturn yet another terrible regula-
tion approved during the final days of 
the Trump administration, a rule that 
actually makes it harder for victims of 
employment discrimination to get jus-
tice. 
For decades, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, has 
protected employees against workplace 
discrimination. If a worker believes 
they were targeted by their employer 
because of their age, their sex, their re-
ligion, their disability, or any other 
unlawful basis—their race—the EEOC 
can conduct an investigation and begin 
a conciliation process. 
Rather than force employees to sue 
in court, where well-heeled corpora-
tions can afford high-priced lawyers 
and the plaintiff almost has no chance 
of 
winning, 
conciliation 
gives 
the 
EEOC the power to fight on workers’ 
behalf against discriminatory behavior 
and win some speedy and effective re-
sults. 
So, of course, the Trump administra-
tion, in another example of their cal-
lousness, another example where they 
talk about working people but don’t 
care about them and do things to help 
them, 
sort 
of 
nastily—almost 
vi-
ciously—changed the rules on concilia-
tion at the EEOC to put a large thumb 
down on the scale in favor of corpora-
tions and against individuals who were 
discriminated against or at least who 
allege discrimination, making it easier 
for corporations to slow down inves-
tigations and even retaliate against 
workers. 
Today’s vote will use the Congres-
sional Review Act process to imme-
diately repeal this rule change. 
At every opportunity, the Trump ad-
ministration 
seemingly 
relished 
in 
making life harder for working Ameri-
cans, while stacking the deck in favor 
of unscrupulous corporations. Now that 
Donald Trump is President no more— 
thank God, I say—we have a chance to 
undo this terrible rule and give work-
ers the confidence that the Federal 
Government is in their corner. 
f 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, on Asian 
hate crimes, I am delighted the House 
will pass the Anti-Asian hate crimes 
bill today, which passed the Senate 
last month with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. Once the legislation is 
approved by the House, it will go di-
rectly to the President’s desk. I expect 
it will be signed into law later this 
week. 
Discrimination against Asian Ameri-
cans is, sadly, not a new phenomenon 
in our Nation’s history, but the pan-
demic brought old biases and preju-
dices back to the foreground. 
This legislation will strengthen law 
enforcement’s ability to detect, deter, 
and prosecute hate crimes of all vari-
eties, especially hate crimes involving 
Asian Americans. It sends a powerful 
message of solidarity to all our friends 
in the Asian American community. It 
is so important, so vital, so strong, and 
an important piece of the puzzle of how 
we build a better future in America. 
I thank my colleagues from both 
Chambers, from Senators Hirono and 
Duckworth in the Senate to Represent-
ative MENG in the House and all those 
who improved the legislation through 
the amendment process here in the 
Senate. 
Today, we are another step closer to 
making progress in the fight against 
racial 
discrimination 
and 
violence 
aimed at Asian Americans in recent 
months. The Senate can be proud it 
took the lead. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2555 
May 18, 2021 
STATE BUDGETS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, re-
cent headlines have reinforced a warn-
ing that Republicans and economic ex-
perts have been articulating literally 
for months: The massive spending the 
Democrats insisted upon at the outset 
of the Biden administration was not in 
step with actual needs. 
Yesterday, I talked about some of the 
ways the multitrillion-dollar spending 
spree rammed through in March has 
actually delayed our reopening and our 
recovery: about the disappointing fall- 
off in hiring, despite a historic number 
of open jobs, after the Democrats re-
newed a Federal program that pays 
people extra not to work. Well, here is 
another misplaced priority from that 
spending spree: our Democratic friends’ 
insistence on stuffing another wheel-
barrow of cash into the accounts of 
State and local governments that were 
already rebounding from the crisis. 
Back in February, as the Democrats 
insisted States were in dire need of an-
other huge bailout, 29 of the 50 States 
were actually closing a 12-month chap-
ter in which their revenues met or ex-
ceeded the year before. Twenty-nine of 
the fifty States were actually closing a 
12-month chapter in which their reve-
nues met or exceeded the year before 
the pandemic. 
The faster-than-expected economic 
recovery, combined with the five bipar-
tisan bills Congress passed in 2020, left 
a lot of cities and States in even better 
shape in exiting the pandemic than 
they were heading into it. Rising tax 
revenues had put these States in a po-
sition not only to weather pandemic- 
related downturns but to fill in pre-
existing budgetary potholes that actu-
ally had nothing to do with COVID 
hardships. 
Of course, that didn’t stop the Demo-
crats from cramming nearly another 
$200 billion in State bailouts into the 
American Rescue Plan. Impressively, 
California got its hands on $26 billion 
of the $200 billion. By the way, the 
State of California now claims it al-
ready has a budget surplus three times 
that size—three times that size of a 
budget surplus—and we are sending 
them another $26 billion. 
They are having to brainstorm new 
ideas to spend the unneeded avalanche 
of cash. I understand the State’s Gov-
ernor has come up with one idea he 
likes. He is planning to cut a timely 
round of State-level stimulus checks to 
include people who are in the country 
illegally—just in time for his recall 
election later this year. Is that the 
kind of urgent priority the Democrats 
had in mind when they used COVID to 
push through what they called the 
‘‘most progressive’’ legislation in his-
tory? 
Experts warned it was poorly tar-
geted, and Republicans said American 
families deserved better, but the big 
catalog of political payouts was pushed 
right through. Let’s remember exactly 
how this played out before we are 
doomed to repeat it again. 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on an entirely different matter, 
yesterday, the Senate took a step to-
ward considering wide-ranging legisla-
tion that would touch on multiple 
parts of the U.S. economy in the name 
of increasing innovation and competi-
tiveness. 
A secure, productive, and innovative 
America that can outcompete China is 
something that all 100 Senators want. 
Of course, in a place like the Senate, 
you are guaranteed to find a wide vari-
ety of different ideas about the best 
ways to encourage that. A number of 
our colleagues have assembled a pro-
posal that touches on a long list of sub-
jects—everything from funding univer-
sities, to regional economic develop-
ment, to Indo-Pacific geopolitics, to 
artificial intelligence, to cyber secu-
rity, and beyond. Legislation this 
broad needs a thorough, robust, and bi-
partisan floor process, including a 
healthy series of amendment votes. 
As one of my Republican colleagues— 
the ranking member on the Commerce 
Committee—explained, as he supported 
moving the legislation out of com-
mittee, the current draft is ‘‘not ready 
for prime time’’ yet and deserves a ro-
bust process here on the floor. 
I understand this bill has come to the 
floor with a bipartisan understanding 
and the Democratic leader’s assurances 
that there won’t be an effort to close 
debate on amendments prematurely. 
So I look forward to the Senate’s con-
sidering these important issues, and I 
hope all of this interest in our competi-
tion with China will lead our Demo-
cratic friends to rethink President 
Biden’s intention to cut our defense 
spending after inflation. The single 
best thing we can do to stay competi-
tive with China is to give our Armed 
Forces the resources they need to stay 
competitive with China. 
f 
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
one final matter, sometime soon, we 
also expect to vote on a Democratic 
resolution to overturn a rule put in 
place by the previous administration. 
Under Republican leadership, the Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commis-
sion—an aggressive Washington regu-
lator of the American job market— 
issued modified marching orders that 
increased transparency and decreased 
the odds of expensive lawsuits. 
Several years back, one investigation 
found the EEOC had become very ag-
gressive and was perpetrating a kind of 
legal harassment on job creators, often 
leaving American taxpayers on the 
hook for court cases which the Com-
mission had actually lost. Taxpayers 
were paying to sue job creators and 
lose in court, so the Republicans up-
dated their guidance. It was the first 
substantial update of the way the 
EEOC handles disputes and concilia-
tion since 1977. It said that the em-
ployer in question deserves a written 
summary of the facts behind a com-
plaint, a written explanation of the 
legal justification, a few other details, 
and 14 days to respond. Sounds pretty 
reasonable. This helps ensure the Com-
mission is making a good-faith effort 
to see if the dispute can be settled out-
side of court before beginning a costly, 
adversarial process. 
Apparently, even these modest steps 
were too much for my friends on the 
Democratic side. They want to roll 
back this progress. A number of groups 
have asked them not to do this, from 
small business owners, to builders and 
contractors, to restaurant owners, to 
retailers, and beyond. These are the 
same employers who are already strug-
gling to climb back out of this pan-
demic and rehire workers. They don’t 
need any more Washington headwinds 
in their faces, and taxpayers don’t need 
more of their dollars being funneled 
back toward trial lawyers. So I would 
urge Senators to vote against this reso-
lution so the current, improved rule 
can actually be left in place. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2556 
May 18, 2021 
He was partially joking, of course, 
but what he was getting at is that gov-
ernment is not always the solution, 
and the government can sometimes do 
more harm than good, and we are defi-
nitely seeing some evidence of that 
right now. 
On May 7, the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics released the April jobs report. 
With businesses desperate to hire and 
vaccinations increasing daily, the re-
port was expected to be big, with a 
good chance that a million or more 
workers would be hired. 
But that is not what happened. Just 
266,000 workers were hired, despite the 
fact that there were 8.1 million job 
openings as of the end of March, and 
the unemployment rate ticked up. 
That is right. Despite the fact that 
businesses are desperate to hire work-
ers, the unemployment rate actually 
increased, and it turns out that we 
don’t have to look far for one of the 
reasons—Democrats’ massive, partisan 
spending bill, which, among others 
things, extended the expanded unem-
ployment benefits to September of this 
year, to the point where many workers 
are making more staying home than 
they would be going back to work. 
Increasing 
unemployment 
benefits 
was the right thing to do early in the 
pandemic. 
Businesses 
were 
closed, 
workers were being forced to say home, 
and the landscape was bleak. But even 
last year it became clear that our econ-
omy was starting to rebound. 
That didn’t mean it was time to 
eliminate all government help, but it 
did mean that we needed to calibrate 
the help to actual need. 
But Democrats consistently rejected 
that line of thinking, and despite the 
fact that we had passed our fifth bipar-
tisan COVID relief bill in December— 
bringing the total amount of COVID 
funding the Federal Government had 
provided to $4 trillion—weeks later, 
Democrats announced that we needed 
another massive COVID relief bill. 
Republicans tried to suggest that 
maybe we should keep it carefully tar-
geted to meet remaining needs without 
wasting taxpayer dollars or running 
the risk of overstimulating the econ-
omy and driving up inflation, but 
Democrats were having none of that. 
This was urgently needed funding, we 
were told. America needed a massive 
rescue plan to save us from the virus, 
and Democrats were going to make it 
happen. 
Well, as it turns out, that massive 
rescue package was too massive. Demo-
crats insisted on extending increased 
unemployment benefits to September 
of this year, and now we are seeing the 
result. 
Reports suggest that many people 
are declining to return to work because 
they can make more money staying 
home and drawing unemployment ben-
efits. That is right. Jobs are avail-
able—the number of job openings is 
very high—but thanks to Democrats’ 
long-term extension of increased unem-
ployment benefits, some workers are 
staying on the sidelines. 
It is not surprising. If individuals can 
make as much or more sitting at home 
instead of working, it is not very 
shocking that many would choose not 
to work. 
The long-term increase in unemploy-
ment benefits is not, of course, the 
only factor keeping people from re-
turning to the workforce, but it is 
clear that it is one substantial reason 
why businesses are struggling to find 
workers. 
In the wake of April’s dismal jobs re-
port, Democrats, of course, were quick 
to discredit or downplay any associa-
tion between increased unemployment 
benefits and the reluctance of some 
workers to come off the sidelines. 
The President’s Treasury Secretary 
suggested that a significant reason for 
not returning to work was the fact that 
schools have not fully reopened. Well, 
that is definitely another factor, and it 
is a problem Democrats could have ad-
dressed with their March COVID legis-
lation. 
Democrats directed tens of billions of 
additional dollars to schools in their 
legislation, most of which will be used 
long after the pandemic is over. 
Republicans repeatedly urged Demo-
crats to tie this funding to school re-
opening, but the teachers unions were 
not too interested in returning to 
school, and Democrats have made it 
very clear that unions’ wish is Demo-
crats’ command. 
And so Democrats gave schools bil-
lions of additional dollars to respond to 
COVID, 
without 
actually 
requiring 
schools to follow the science and re-
open. 
And so, yes, many parents are strug-
gling with returning to work because 
their kids are still not fully back to in- 
person learning, and it is too bad that 
Democrats were more committed to 
satisfying the teachers unions than 
getting kids back to the classroom. 
Before 
Democrats 
passed 
their 
COVID bill, there were concerns that 
the size of it could end up overstimu-
lating the economy and thus driving up 
inflation. Even some liberal econo-
mists sounded the alarm over the size 
of Democrats’ coronavirus legislation. 
But, again, Democrats were not about 
to listen to any calls to reduce the size 
of their massive spending bill. 
And while the full results of Demo-
crats’ spending spree have yet to be 
seen, there are already signs that infla-
tion may be becoming a problem. 
Consumers are seeing increases—in 
some cases, steep increases—in the 
price of everything from groceries to 
used cars, to trucks. 
There is no question that govern-
ment had a significant role to play in 
responding to the COVID crisis. That is 
why a Republican-led Senate passed 
five—five—COVID relief bills, totaling 
$4 trillion, and why we supported ev-
erything from increased unemploy-
ment benefits to forgivable loans to 
help small businesses weather the 
virus. 
But as the crisis wanes, so should the 
role of government. American workers 
are no longer being forced to stay home 
while businesses close their doors. Our 
economy is back up and running, and 
businesses are desperate for workers. 
We should be doing everything that 
we can to get Americans back to work, 
and Democrats’ $1.9 trillion boondoggle 
isn’t helping us with that goal. 
A Democratic operative famously 
said: ‘‘Never let a serious crisis go to 
waste.’’ And as our economy has recov-
ered, a lot of Democrats have seemed 
very unwilling to let go of the pan-
demic. I don’t know if that is because 
Democrats want to take credit for get-
ting our Nation out of this, even 
though all the essential groundwork 
for our massive vaccination campaign 
and our economic recovery was laid in 
the previous administration or if it is 
because Democrats think that the 
COVID crisis will provide them with 
the cover they need to permanently in-
crease government spending and gov-
ernment intervention on a massive 
scale. But whatever their motivation, 
the fact is that Democrats need to real-
ize that it is time—it is time to get 
government out of the way of the re-
covery, and that should start with in-
creasing, not decreasing, incentives for 
Americans to get back to work. 
As we are seeing right now, some-
times throwing government money at a 
situation can do more harm than good. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, over the 
weekend, Israeli fighter jets demol-
ished an office building in Gaza that 
housed the members of Hamas, the ter-
rorist organization dedicated to wiping 
Israel and its people off the map, and 
they are actively pursuing that mis-
sion as we speak by firing thousands of 
rockets and missiles indiscriminately 
into Israeli cities. 
To minimize civilian casualties, the 
Israeli Defense Forces gave persons in 
the building 1 hour advance notice the 
building was coming down. Everyone 
evacuated safely, including, one sadly 
assumes, Hamas fighters. When the air-
strike came, there were no reported ci-
vilian casualties. 
Certain activists in the press seem to 
meet every Israeli airstrike against 
terrorists with outrage, but this one 
elicited even more self-righteous indig-
nation than usual. It quickly came to 
light that the Associated Press and Al 
Jazeera had news bureaus in that very 
building. The AP had lost prime real 
estate in the strike—real estate with a 
rooftop terrace. Some even lost their 
cameras.

S2557 
May 18, 2021 
The AP’s top newsman said he was 
‘‘shocked and horrified’’ by an air-
strike that caused no casualties. He 
also 
disclaimed 
any 
knowledge 
of 
Hamas’s presence in the building, de-
spite 
‘‘actively 
check[ing].’’ 
Many 
other journalists and their advocacy 
organizations also mounted up on their 
moral high horses against Israel. 
But the AP story just didn’t add up. 
So I asked a few basic questions in a 
speech right here yesterday afternoon; 
namely, why was the Associated Press 
sharing a building with Hamas in the 
first place? Did it knowingly allow its 
journalists to be used as human shields 
by a U.S.-designated terrorist organiza-
tion? Did the AP pull its punches and 
decline to report for years on Hamas’s 
misdeeds? 
One would think that these are sim-
ple and reasonable questions, but I di-
rected them to a media organization. 
So the usual suspects circled the wag-
ons, expressing more outrage at my au-
dacity to question AP’s leadership than 
they do at Hamas for trying to kill 
Jews by the thousands. 
Keith Olbermann called me an ‘‘anti- 
Constitution, anti-Free Press, racist 
fascist.’’ One Slate reporter wrote that 
I was making ‘‘deranged insinuations’’ 
and going to ‘‘bat against civilians in a 
war-zone,’’ even though no civilians 
had been harmed in this airstrike. 
The constant refrain of their criti-
cism was that I was attacking the 
brave 
reporters 
of 
the 
Associated 
Press’s Gaza bureau. My claims were 
baseless, reckless, ‘‘without evidence,’’ 
they claimed. But, in fact, there is 
plenty of evidence that some media 
outlet station in Gaza allowed them-
selves to be used as pawns by Hamas. 
According to an article from the At-
lantic magazine in 2014, written by 
none other than, yes, a former Associ-
ated Press reporter, the AP had abun-
dant reason to suspect Hamas’s pres-
ence years before the IDF informed 
them by telephone last weekend. Ac-
cording to the article, Hamas fighters 
burst into the AP’s Gaza bureau during 
a previous conflict and threatened the 
staff. Hamas also launched missiles 
right outside the AP’s office. In each 
case, somehow the intrepid reporters of 
the Associated Press’s Gaza bureau 
didn’t even report on these incidents. 
The AP instead turned a blind eye to 
terrorism and embraced a culture of si-
lence on behalf of murderers who ac-
tively endangered its own reporters 
and staff. What is equally scandalous is 
that the AP continued to locate their 
offices in a building they knew was 
dangerous. The AP had been in that 
building for 15 years. Hamas fighters 
had threatened AP staff and its offices 
and launched missiles right outside on 
the street. In 15 years did no one ever 
say: Gosh, I wonder why Hamas keeps 
running around our office building? Did 
no one in AP’s leadership think: You 
know, maybe we should move our peo-
ple to a safer building in a better 
neighborhood? 
Under the circumstances, I am not 
sure what is worse, that the AP knew 
they shared their building with Hamas 
or that they didn’t know. 
Instead of uncovering the truth, the 
AP concealed it. Then, when the IDF 
carried out its fully justified and whol-
ly appropriate airstrike, the AP con-
demned Israel in one final parting gift 
to their neighbors from Hamas. 
Now, one would think that this epi-
sode might result in some soul-search-
ing. The AP’s leadership might see it 
as a humbling moment, instead of an 
opportunity to self-aggrandize and play 
the victim. But the AP’s willingness to 
double down on their Hamas apologism 
raises, yet again, some more uncom-
fortable questions. Would the AP allow 
its reporters to share a building with 
al-Qaida? What about ISIS? Because 
there are little differences between 
these U.S.-designated terrorist organi-
zations and Hamas. 
Some prestigious news outlets have 
fallen pretty far from the heights they 
once occupied. Being a reporter, and, 
certainly, a war correspondent, can be 
honorable 
work. 
Great 
men 
and 
women, including Winston Churchill, 
have dedicated themselves to the pro-
fession. Correspondents have gone to 
the frontlines and reported on some of 
the deadliest conflicts in human his-
tory with courage, commitment to 
truth, and patriotism. 
During the Second World War, for ex-
ample, a great American named Ernie 
Pyle marched alongside GIs in North 
Africa, Italy, Normandy, and the Pa-
cific, reporting right up until the mo-
ment he was killed by Japanese ma-
chine-gun fire. He did some of his very 
best work for none other than the As-
sociated Press. 
Ernie Pyle was the farthest thing 
from an old press hack. He described 
the fighting up close and advocated for 
better pay and conditions for the 
troops. He could be critical of the serv-
ices when they were wrong, but he 
never forgot whose side he was on, and 
he never gave up his commitment to 
telling the stories of normal people and 
the hard-working troops on the front-
line. 
Before America’s entrance into the 
war, Pyle reported from the streets of 
London during the Blitz, recounting 
the terrifying scenes for readers back 
home in the States. He told the story 
of a resolute people under siege and 
forced into bombshell shelters by an in-
discriminate and evil attacker—a peo-
ple unbent and unbroken by terror, 
dedicated to victory, no matter the ad-
versity. 
We often learn from reporting like 
that, but you may not read it these 
days in the Associated Press. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

The Senator from Iowa. 
PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
May 7, we learned of a cyber attack on 
the Colonial Pipeline. This resulted in 
gas shortages and lines across the east 
coast. You see it on television every 
day. 
During a news conference, Energy 
Secretary Granholm said: ‘‘Pipelines 
are the best way to transport fuel.’’ 
This is certainly a fact. Pipelines are 
much safer than transporting oil by 
rail or truck. Iowa has over 40,000 miles 
of pipeline which go largely unnoticed 
but play a large role in providing our 
Nation’s transportation fuel. 
It is not lost on millions of Ameri-
cans that this statement from the En-
ergy Secretary comes from the same 
administration that, on day one, Janu-
ary 20, shut down the Keystone Pipe-
line. On day one, January 20, this ad-
ministration cut 10,000 jobs. Remem-
ber, they ran on a platform of creating 
jobs. This has already resulted in rising 
gas prices like we are seeing across the 
country. In fact, gas prices will soon be 
more expensive than at any time since 
the Obama administration. 
This cyber attack on Colonial showed 
America just how critical pipeline in-
frastructure is for transportation and 
how that affects national security. For 
an administration that is stressing in-
frastructure, maybe they should take a 
second look at the decision on January 
20 to shut down the Keystone XL Pipe-
line. I shudder to think that if the Co-
lonial Pipeline were attempting to get 
a permit today, this administration 
might not even allow the construction. 
The United States should be encour-
aging private infrastructure invest-
ment, not getting in the way of 
progress that investment would bring. 
As long as our country is still relying 
on oil to fill our gas tanks, we need to 
have the infrastructure and security in 
place so that what happened last week 
never happens again. 
When there is a shortage of oil, then 
biofuels can be an easy substitute that 
can be subbed in, but again, govern-
ment redtape is getting in the way. 
The Environmental Protection Agency 
should quickly finalize a rule to broad-
en the availability of existing infra-
structure for use with E15 ethanol and 
related labeling requirements. This 
would allow more gas stations to use 
their current tanks for E15. 
We need a balanced approach, and 
biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel 
can help achieve greenhouse gas reduc-
tions and strengthen our national secu-
rity, keeping gas prices in check and 
helping agriculture of America at the 
same time. 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER 
Mr. President, on another matter, I 
have heard from a large number of 
Iowans convinced that our Republic is 
effectively lost with the election of 
President Biden. This seems to be like 
the Flight 93 election theory in the 2016 
election, where some conservatives felt 
that, if Clinton won, the country would

be lost for good. So, like the Flight 93 
passengers who rushed the cockpit in a 
last-ditch attempt to avert a cata-
strophic outcome that probably would 
have hit this Capitol Building, they ar-
gued that any alternative to Clinton 
was justified. 
The left, then, felt the same way 
after Trump won. When President 
Trump was elected, I received an out-
pouring of messages expressing a truly 
startling degree of fear and anguish. It 
is as if we had just elected an evil King 
or dictator. 
Understanding human nature, the 
Framers of our Constitution set up a 
system of separation of powers, know-
ing it was not safe to just trust the 
character of individual public officials. 
The President is supposed to, as the 
Constitution said, ‘‘see that the laws 
be faithfully executed,’’ not to be some 
all-powerful, elected King. 
The American Presidency shouldn’t 
be and was never supposed to be so im-
portant or so powerful that Americans 
ought to feel that their entire future is 
at stake every 4 years. Yet many 
Americans do feel that way, and it 
isn’t all just a misunderstanding. 
Presidential power has grown beyond 
its proper bounds intended by the Con-
stitution. Why is that? That ‘‘Why is 
it?’’ lies right here with the Congress 
of the United States because, over 
time, Congress has delegated too much 
authority piece by piece, in countless 
bills, and failed to this very day to do 
much to take back that authority. 
During the Trump administration, I 
worked to reclaim some delegated pow-
ers over tariffs, emergency declara-
tions, and regulations but lacked suffi-
cient bipartisan support to get the job 
done. I have no illusions that a Demo-
cratic Congress will limit President 
Biden’s powers, but perhaps we could 
agree to reclaim powers for Congress 
with some future effective date. 
So much focus on one person, wheth-
er it is a Republican or a Democrat, 
and one election every 4 years, like we 
worried about 2016 or people are still 
worrying about 2020—that is not a 
healthy environment for a democracy. 
Restoring the proper balance between 
the Presidency and the Congress can 
help restore some balance to our fiscal 
discourse. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, Winston 
Churchill is often credited with the 
apocryphal quote that ‘‘we sleep sound-
ly in our beds because rough men stand 
ready in the night to visit violence on 
those who would do us harm.’’ 
This is still true, but the 21st century 
has gotten more complicated. We live 
in an era of hybrid wars. There are 
fewer D-days on enemy beaches and 
more zero-day exploits in enemy serv-
ers. 
Americans sleep soundly at night be-
cause, in addition to these rough men 
at the ready, brilliant men and women 
work around the clock to develop na-
tional security technology that defends 
our interests and undermines our en-
emies. DARPA—the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency—is on the 
frontlines of that work. They are rac-
ing against our adversaries. 
Our technology struggle against the 
Chinese Communist Party is the defin-
ing national security challenge of our 
time. Chairman Xi and his techno-au-
thoritarian regime are fundamentally 
opposed to not just American values 
but American interests all around the 
globe. 
Our citizens watching this Chamber 
on most days might think that most of 
their political leaders are content to 
ignore this reality, but I assure my col-
leagues in this Chamber that the CCP 
is not asleep at the switch. 
Beijing is aggressively investing in 
machine learning and artificial intel-
ligence and in quantum computing. 
They are hacking and stealing Amer-
ica’s research and America’s intellec-
tual property. The Chinese Communist 
Party is on a mission, and they make 
no attempt to hide it. They want to be-
come the world’s preeminent super-
power, and they think that by claiming 
first-mover advantage in the cyber do-
main, they can achieve this. We can’t 
let that happen. 
My amendment to today’s legislation 
is simple: It doubles DARPA’s budget, 
$3.5 billion to $7 billion a year for each 
of the next 5 years. The work of the Na-
tional Science Foundation is important 
as well, and I support that work. I sup-
port that research. But the NSF’s re-
search is broad. DARPA’s research is 
directly applied to our most critical 
national security challenges. 
Cutting-edge, classified tech develop-
ment is in DARPA’s DNA. When we 
talk about identifying and disrupting 
the CCP’s AI-enabled cyber and infor-
mation campaigns, we want DARPA to 
be leading that work. When we talk 
about developing new technological 
tools to push back on the CCP’s hybrid 
warfare, we want DARPA to be leading 
that work. 
If we want American democracy to 
outlast 
Chinese 
techno- 
authoritarianism, we can make this in-
vestment. Doubling DARPA’s budget is 
a cost-effective investment that bol-
sters that work, and it bolsters the 
work of the Endless Frontier legisla-
tion we are debating this week, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from Florida. 
CHINA 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a year ago 
Saturday, the previous administration, 
the Trump administration, launched 
something 
called 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed. At that time, it was a $10 billion 
program by the government, and it was 
designed to incentivize pharmaceutical 
companies to invest in developing, re-
searching, 
and 
producing 
effective 
treatments and a vaccine for a disease 
that was ravaging and continues to 
ravage the world today. 
Less than 4 months later, a new anti-
body treatment was beginning to save 
American lives and improving the out-
comes of patients with COVID–19 here 
in America. And less than 7 months 
after that Operation Warp Speed pro-
gram began, Americans began receiv-
ing the first dose of two different and 
highly effective vaccines. 
Why did the government have to step 
in? Why did the government have to 
provide the money? Wouldn’t the mar-
ket have solved this? There was cer-
tainly a demand. There was certainly a 
need for it. In fact, I would argue that 
people probably would have paid what-
ever it took to get their hands on a 
vaccine and on new treatments given 
the level of desperation that existed in 
May of last year here and around the 
world. 
Yes, the market would have eventu-
ally developed the antivirals, would 
have developed the antibody treat-
ments, and would have developed the 
vaccine. The market would have even-
tually done it without the government 
stepping in, in this dramatic way. But 
it wouldn’t have done it in the timing 
that we needed it. We needed it right 
away. Our economy was shut down. 
Children were not going to school. 
Workers had no jobs. Small businesses 
were being wiped out. Hospitals were 
being overrun, and people were dying. 
We were facing a global crisis and a na-
tional emergency. It was a moment 
that required urgent attention and the 
fastest results possible. So for the com-
mon good of our country, our govern-
ment partnered with the private sector 
to reach a targeted end, one that 
served the interest of our country and 
our people. In short, we pursued ‘‘in-
dustrial policy’’ and almost 1 year to 
the very day, it was announced that 
life in America is, slowly but steadily, 
returning to normal. 
I first spoke about the need for a 21st 
century American industrial policy 
well over a year before the pandemic 
hit. Let me tell you that for much of 
my adult life, much of the time I even 
paid attention to policy, ‘‘industrial 
policy’’ was generally sort of a dirty 
phrase for me. Politically, I was raised 
capitalist orthodox. It is an economic 
faith grounded in the belief of less 
taxes and less government and more 
freedom. 
I still believe in less taxes and less 
government and more freedom, and my 
faith in capitalism has only grown be-
cause, unlike socialism, the market al-
ways produces the most efficient out-
come and, usually, generally, invari-
ably, the result of that is prosperity 
and opportunity. The free market— 
capitalism—has eradicated more pov-
erty than all the socialist programs in 
the world combined.

May 18, 2021 
But 
the 
market 
is 
agnostic. 
It 
doesn’t take into account the impact 
that an efficient outcome, a market 
outcome, would have on its people. 
Thus the market does not take into ac-
count its national interests. It is ag-
nostic. 
We in public policy cannot be agnos-
tic. The job of those of us who serve in 
the American Government is to make 
decisions that are in the best interests 
of America and the people that we 
serve. I believe that, generally and in-
variably, 
that 
usually means sup-
porting a vibrant system of free enter-
prise in which private businesses invest 
and innovate and produce, and govern-
ment makes it easier for them to do 
that and gets out of the way. 
But what do we do, what should we 
do, when the market reaches the most 
efficient outcome and the most effi-
cient outcome is one that is bad for 
America, bad for Americans, or doesn’t 
meet a crisis at hand fast enough? 
What is our role when we face such a 
crisis, when we must address one that 
has to be addressed faster than the 
market’s ability to do it? 
This is not a hypothetical question. 
It describes what we faced in May of 
last year, when Operation Warp Speed 
was announced, and it describes many 
of the important challenges we face 
today. 
Over the last 20 years—maybe 25 
years—the market sent American fac-
tories and jobs to other countries. This 
was the most efficient decision to 
make because workers in other coun-
tries cost less, and so it lowered labor 
costs and increased profits. It was the 
market’s decision. It was the efficient 
decision, but it destroyed the jobs of 
Americans. It shattered families. It 
gutted once-vibrant communities. 
Major 
American 
corporations 
headquartered 
here 
in 
the 
United 
States—multinationals—have 
allowed 
China to steal trade secrets and cheat 
on trade because, for them, gaining ac-
cess to even a small sliver of the grow-
ing Chinese market of over a billion 
people led to profits. This, indeed, did 
create short-term profits and extrava-
gant wealth for some, but in the proc-
ess it began transforming America 
from a country that invents and makes 
things into one that increasingly just 
finances and buys them. 
It is, indeed, more efficient to make 
the active ingredients in many of our 
medicines in China. It is cheaper to do 
it. So, today, we find ourselves depend-
ing on China to produce the active in-
gredients in everything from acetami-
nophen, which is generic for Tylenol, 
all the way to blood thinners and ev-
erything in between. 
It was cheaper to buy rare-earth min-
erals from China—it still is—than to 
produce and mine our own. Today, we 
depend on them for almost 90 percent 
of these valuable metals that are need-
ed not just for advanced electronics but 
for our own major weapons systems. 
We made the decision to allow Chinese 
companies free rein to own and to buy 
and to make money in America, almost 
without restrictions, because we are 
capitalists. 
They, on the other hand, restrict and 
ban our businesses from doing work in 
China because they are nationalists. 
None of this is an accident. China has 
a plan. It has a plan to overtake Amer-
ica as the world’s leading economic, 
technological, geopolitical, diplomatic, 
and military power. I don’t say this to 
you based on some supersecret intel-
ligence document or an educated guess. 
They put it on paper. They have writ-
ten this out for everyone to see in 2015. 
The Chinese Communist Party laid out 
a plan with a title called ‘‘Made in 
China 2025.’’ 
It basically is a plan to invest in and 
overtake us in 10 of the industries that 
will define the 21st century economy— 
biomedicine, advanced technology, air 
and space, artificial intelligence, quan-
tum computing, telecommunications, 
5G, rail systems, ship building. They 
intend to lead the world in all of these 
areas, and they are executing on a plan 
to carry that out, and we have been 
complacent and distracted. 
So while China channels every ele-
ment of their national power, every 
element that you can imagine—while 
they channel all of it—to dominate 
these key industries and to do it at our 
expense, we assume that our position 
in the world will continue on its own 
without having to do anything to 
maintain it. 
While China is pursuing economic 
and technological dominance, we find 
ourselves here busy canceling people, 
demanding the use of the right pronoun 
to describe people, or claiming that re-
quiring a photo ID to vote is the return 
of a Jim Crow era. 
We have placed ourselves on the road 
of decline and humiliation, headed to-
ward a world in which a totalitarian 
regime—one guilty right now, as we 
speak, of committing genocide against 
Uighur Muslims—becomes the leading 
power on the planet and relegating our 
country, America, into the status of a 
once great nation in decline. 
We do not need to abandon cap-
italism and embrace socialism to take 
on this challenge. I believe socialism 
would only accelerate the damage our 
decisions are doing to our country. We 
need capitalism, but it must be a cap-
italism geared toward promoting the 
national interest and the common 
good, where the private market drives 
our economic decisions. And in those 
instances where the market outcome is 
bad for our country, in those instances 
in which the market’s most efficient 
outcome is one that is bad for our peo-
ple, for our national security, for our 
national interests, bad for America—in 
those instances—what we need is tar-
geted industrial policy to further the 
common good and to protect our peo-
ple, our country, and our future. We 
need an industrial policy targeted not 
to every industry or to the one who 
hires the right lobbyist. No, we need an 
industrial policy like Operation Warp 
Speed, targeted to urgent national 
needs; policies like my Medical Manu-
facturing, Economic Development, and 
Sustainability Act, which would help 
bring back our ability to make medi-
cines in this country again, including 
in places like Puerto Rico that need 
the economic growth and jobs; like the 
CHIPS Act we passed last year to make 
sure we never have to depend on China 
or any other country, for that matter, 
for semiconductors. 
In 2019, well before the pandemic, I 
proposed modernizing the Small Busi-
ness Administration and aligning its 
programs to the national interest, like 
my American Innovation and Manufac-
turing Act, which would incentivize 
private investment in small American 
manufacturers through the SBA. 
And even as we make these sorts of 
targeted industrial policy decisions, we 
need to make sure that we are pro-
tecting them from being stolen from 
us. One of the changes we need to make 
in the China bill that is now before the 
Senate is we need to have stronger pro-
tections against the research that we 
are funding from being stolen. 
First, more of this money should be 
invested through agencies like DARPA, 
as an example, which has very good 
safeguards in place. 
Second, we should prohibit any enti-
ty from receiving the funds called for 
in this bill if they receive China-based 
financial or in-kind support, or if they 
otherwise failed to disclose foreign 
funding in the past 10 years. 
Third, we should require certification 
that a potential recipient of the fund-
ing has sufficient protections in place 
to guard against IP theft and other 
threats from foreign governments be-
fore they were giving them the money. 
It would be something if we appro-
priate all this money for industrial pol-
icy, we invest it, and then we see it 
stolen. 
Fourth, we should prohibit Federal 
employees and contractors from par-
ticipating in any foreign government 
talent recruitment program, and we 
should require Federal contractors to 
disclose any commercial ties they 
might have to the Communist Party in 
China. 
And, fifth, we should establish a sys-
tem of outbound investment screening. 
Even if we are successful in preventing 
adversarial actors from acquiring Fed-
eral research dollars or intellectual 
property developed by it, there is noth-
ing to stop nationless corporations 
from simply buying the IP and using it 
to develop capacities to benefit China 
and hurt our interests. 
This is an important moment, I 
think, one that will define the remain-
der of the century. When the book 
about the 21st century is written, it 
will have a few chapters about a lot of 
different things. But that book is going 
to be about the relationship between 
China and the United States and what 
happened, and what happened is in very 
many ways being decided right now.

We must ensure that our public poli-
cies are aligned to the urgent chal-
lenges of our time. Our job here is to 
promote the common good and to de-
fend the national interest. By and 
large, that is a free enterprise, capi-
talist economy that will produce the 
innovation, the investments, and all of 
the things necessary to make that pos-
sible. 
Yet, in those instances in which a na-
tional need is urgent, in which the out-
come that the market has delivered is 
harming our country and its long-term 
future, we have an obligation to act on 
the common good. We should not allow 
orthodoxy or policies that made a lot 
of sense in the 1980s—a very different 
world from today—to stand in the way 
of the sorts of targeted government- 
private partnerships needed: the kinds 
of partnerships that gave us a vaccine 
that is bringing us back to normal; the 
kind of partnership that will allow us 
to tackle the challenges we face now so 
that the 21st century will ultimately 
be an American century and so that 
our leadership in these key industries 
that will define the century is neither 
endangered nor lost. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, one of 
the topics of discussion right now here 
in Washington, DC—actually, there are 
many different topics of discussion, but 
one of those is infrastructure. Depend-
ing on who you ask, you are likely to 
get different answers on what exactly 
people mean when they say the word 
‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
When I and my constituents in Texas 
think about infrastructure, we think 
about our highways and bridges. Now, 
those are two of the big things that 
come to mind. We are home to the larg-
est network of highways in the Nation, 
as well as the largest number of 
bridges, and these structures are sup-
porting more and more Texans by the 
day. It is no secret that, in the last 
decade, Texas has grown by nearly 4 
million people—roughly the population 
of our neighbor to the north, Okla-
homa. If we want to get all 29 million 
Texans and our visitors and our crucial 
commercial cargo around the State 
safely and efficiently, we need a reli-
able network of transportation infra-
structure, and there is a lot of room for 
improvement over the status quo. 
Every year, the American Society of 
Civil Engineers evaluates America’s in-
frastructure and issues a report card 
that lets us know how we are doing. 
Well, America is barely passing with a 
C-minus. Texas is faring only slightly 
better than the rest of the class with a 
C. There is no doubt about it—it is 
time for an investment in our infra-
structure. Now more than ever, that in-
vestment must be made responsibly. 
We just spent trillions of dollars to 
help the American people and our econ-
omy get through a pandemic, and our 
national debt is at its highest level 
since World War II. I have told my 
friends back home that this is the do-
mestic equivalent to a world war. We 
didn’t ask in World War II: How much 
money can we spend? We needed to de-
feat our enemies, and we did. Then we 
needed to come together responsibly 
and figure out how to pay for it. 
We don’t need to quit spending alto-
gether, but we surely must take a clos-
er look at what is necessary and what 
is desirable and what is something we 
would like to have but that could be 
put off for another day. Think of the 
Goldilocks principle: not too hot, not 
too cold. In this case: not too small, 
not too big. We need to find the right 
size, and we need to agree on what that 
means. 
The most recent highway and transit 
funding bill that became law was the 
FAST Act of 2015. That bill came in 
right around $300 billion. Last Con-
gress, before the pandemic hit, it 
looked like we were poised to pass a 
similar 
bill 
at 
roughly 
the 
same 
pricetag. I think we can all agree that, 
now, something of that size is probably 
too small. We need to invest in our in-
frastructure—repair 
our 
roads, 
our 
bridges, our airports, our levees, and 
other 
transportation 
infrastructure 
that is long overdue. 
The pandemic has highlighted the 
need to expand that definition, though; 
for example, to strengthen broadband 
and internet access. For many Ameri-
cans, the daily commutes to work or to 
school have been replaced by virtual 
classrooms and telework. Our 21st-cen-
tury economy and society depend on 
internet connections, and we need to 
do more to improve access, especially 
in rural areas, where the big internet 
companies don’t find it commercially 
advantageous to offer service. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that, this time around, we need a larg-
er investment in our Nation’s infra-
structure, but, frankly, the proposal 
from President Biden is far too big. 
The nonpartisan Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget estimates it 
would cost an additional $2.65 trillion— 
roughly nine times the recent highway 
bill that became law—and that is on 
top of the $1.9 trillion that the Senate 
majority and the House and the Presi-
dent just passed into law purportedly 
for additional COVID–19 relief, al-
though only about 10 percent of it ac-
tually addressed COVID–19. The point 
is, we have been spending a lot of 
money, and we can’t keep spending 
money that we are borrowing from fu-
ture generations. 
Not surprisingly, only a fraction of 
the President’s infrastructure bill is 
dedicated to roads and bridges—5 per-
cent, in fact. The vast majority of the 
funding goes toward a long list of pro-
grams and policies that are unrelated 
to 
infrastructure—for 
example, 
caregiving for the elderly and disabled; 
community colleges; programs to im-
prove diversity in STEM careers. All of 
those are important topics, but they 
are 
not 
infrastructure, 
and 
we 
shouldn’t be paying for them by bor-
rowing money from future generations. 
We ought to figure out appropriate off-
sets and pay-fors like we used to do 
here before the pandemic hit. Our job is 
to find the right-sized bill that suits 
our needs without going overboard 
with unnecessary and unrelated spend-
ing. 
Fortunately, Mrs. CAPITO, the Sen-
ator from West Virginia, is leading the 
way to find that Goldilocks just-right 
fit. She and a number of our colleagues 
have outlined to President Biden and 
our Democratic colleagues a frame-
work to improve our Nation’s infra-
structure. The plan they have proposed 
comes in at $568 billion—more than we 
have spent in the past but far less than 
the President’s proposal. 
When we talk about the need for bi-
partisan compromise, this is a great 
place to start. The Republican plan in-
cludes nearly $300 billion for roads and 
bridges—21⁄2 times the President’s plan 
for roads and bridges. It also invests in 
airports, drinking and waste water, 
ports and waterways, broadband, and 
some of the most urgent infrastructure 
priorities in our country. 
Last week, Senator CAPITO and five 
of our Republican colleagues met with 
Vice President HARRIS and President 
Biden to discuss a path forward. They, 
apparently, had a productive meeting, 
and the President seemed to be recep-
tive to many of the ideas that were 
shared. I hope this is the starting point 
for a consensus package that addresses 
our infrastructure needs. 
There is a question that almost no-
body wants to talk about, but thanks 
to Senator RON WYDEN of Oregon and 
Senator MIKE CRAPO of Idaho, we actu-
ally had a virtual hearing on this this 
morning in the Senate Finance Com-
mittee to answer the taboo question 
that nobody really wants to talk 
about, which is, How do we pay for it? 
As I said, this was the subject of the 
Senate Finance Committee hearing 
this morning, and I am sure some of 
the ideas that were put forward will 
begin to start to take traction and, 
hopefully, lead us to a way to respon-
sibly pay for this infrastructure bill. 
In the past, funding for infrastruc-
ture bills has come from the highway 
trust fund, but for years, it has faced 
severe shortfalls. To a serious degree, 
my constituents in Texas have footed 
the bill for those shortfalls. We are one 
of the few States, for example, that re-
ceives less than it contributes to the 
highway trust fund. In other words, we 
are a donor State. For every dollar we 
put into the highway trust fund, we get 
95 cents back. Well, that is not the 
same treatment every State is getting. 
In fact, we have a lower rate of return 
than every other State. If we want to 
have any long-term success in main-
taining our roads and bridges, we have 
to bring this formula up to date, and it 
has to be equitable. 
The smart spending, though, can’t 
stop there. We need to repurpose the 
mountain of unused Federal funds from

the 
so-called 
COVID–19 
relief 
bill. 
States are awash with cash that they, 
frankly, don’t know how to spend. The 
massive $1.9 trillion bill became law 
without the support of a single Repub-
lican because it was so extravagant and 
poorly targeted. Case in point: the blue 
State bailout. This legislation sent 350 
billion additional dollars to State and 
local governments, many of which were 
not facing any budgetary shortfalls. 
We have started to see a flurry of 
news stories in the past few weeks that 
have demonstrated exactly why we 
were opposed to this reckless spending. 
For example, California has reported a 
$75 billion budget surplus—a massive 
amount of money. Governor Newsom 
says this will be used to pay down past 
State debts, send direct checks to Cali-
fornians, and add to its rainy day fund. 
In addition to California, you have New 
York, Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota. 
Each of these States is expected to 
have more than a $1 billion surplus— 
again, because of the massive shuffling 
of cash out of Washington, DC, into the 
States 
that 
was 
not 
targeted 
to 
COVID–19 relief. 
This is exactly why we advocated 
against this tidal wave of funding for 
States that were not even operating in 
the red. Taxpayer dollars shouldn’t be 
spent to erase the debts of mismanaged 
States or to add to their rainy day 
funds. They have the ability to raise 
revenue themselves, so it shouldn’t be 
the responsibility of the Federal tax-
payers to bail them out or to provide 
them with this huge cash cushion with 
their looking to try to find responsible 
ways to spend it. 
Tens of billions of unused dollars 
from 
this 
legislation 
should 
be 
repurposed to help cover the costs of 
these investments without driving our 
national debt even higher. It is com-
mon sense, and I actually believe that 
there is a way to incentivize the States 
to use that additional cash for infra-
structure 
purposes, 
whether 
it 
is 
through modifications and cost sharing 
between State and local governments. 
Many of those States are struggling to 
find a way, within the guidelines and 
guardrails that we have provided for 
COVID–19 relief, to spend it anyway, so 
why not spend it for infrastructure? 
Maybe there is a win-win there. 
There are a number of ideas now on 
the table about how to pay for this in-
frastructure bill, but I hope we can all 
agree that the massive tax hike that 
President Biden is proposing is not the 
answer. This would constitute the larg-
est set of tax hikes in more than half a 
century, and these increases would do 
serious damage to our economy just as 
we are coming out of a pandemic-in-
duced recession. 
At a time when our economy is al-
ready on fragile footing, the tax burden 
on Americans would be greater than 
that of our biggest trading partners 
and competitors, and this would have 
far-reaching consequences for our com-
petitiveness and our economy as a 
whole. After all, we know these tax 
hikes won’t be reflected in lower earn-
ings for CEOs. The brunt will be borne 
by consumers, who will pay higher 
prices, and by workers, who will earn 
lower wages, and let’s not forget those 
whose jobs have disappeared entirely. 
We are already seeing some price hikes 
on some of our most used consumer 
products, covering everything from ce-
real, to diapers, to lumber, and to cars. 
This is not the time to increase taxes 
and drive inflation across our economy, 
which is, actually, a tax increase on 
low- and middle-income people. We 
need to find responsible ways to fund 
an investment in our infrastructure 
without hurting our economy and the 
people we represent. Right now, it ap-
pears that bipartisan progress is being 
made toward that just-right-sized pol-
icy and for it to be paid for in a respon-
sible way or, at least, that is my opti-
mistic hope. 
So I want to thank Senator CAPITO 
for her leadership on this effort and all 
those who have been working with our 
Democratic colleagues and the admin-
istration and encourage them to con-
tinue to work with folks on our side of 
the aisle so we can get this done on a 
timely basis.

TAXES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes-
terday marked the deadline for filing 
personal income taxes in America. I 
am sure many people spent the past 
weekend surrounded by 1099 forms and 
shoe boxes full of receipts, hoping to 
claim a well-deserved tax refund after 
a year of financial stress due to the 
pandemic. 
That is another reason why the 
American Rescue Plan that Congress 
passed earlier this year was such a 
major accomplishment. It included, 
that plan, included the largest, single- 
year tax cut for middle- and low-in-
come earners in the history of the Na-
tion. Let me repeat that. This year’s 
American Rescue Plan included the 
largest, single-year tax cut for middle- 
and low-income earners in America’s 
history. 
But for a privileged few, those tax 
cuts are pennies compared to the de-
ductions they enjoy every year because 
of Republican tax proposals, proposals 
like the Trump tax plan that Repub-
licans signed into law in 2017, just 4 
years ago. Over the next few years, it is 
estimated that more than 80 percent of 
the benefits from this Trump tax plan 
will go exclusively to the top 1 percent 
of American earners—the top 1 percent. 
It is nothing more than welfare for the 
wealthiest. 
Perhaps the most egregious aspect of 
the Trump tax plan is the billions of 
taxpayer dollars it will give to the 
world’s wealthiest individuals and cor-
porations over the next decade. We are 
already feeling the devastating impact 
this corporate giveaway has had on 
America’s economy. 
Listen to this now, if you just turned 
in your taxes. Last year, 55 of the larg-
est companies in America paid zero— 
zero dollars in Federal taxes despite 
making more than $40 billion in prof-
its. Forty billion dollars in profits; zero 
taxes. It is a glaring example of the im-
balance in our tax system. 
I don’t think there is any rational ex-
planation for having schoolteachers 
and janitors pay more in taxes than 
the largest corporations, but it seems 
the folks on the other side of the aisle 
disagree. 
When Senator MCCONNELL met with 
President Biden last week, he said that 
raising 
taxes 
on 
corporations—the 
same corporations that paid zero last 
year in taxes—is a ‘‘red line’’ when it 
comes to funding the President’s infra-
structure package. That means Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, the Republican leader 
in the Senate, would rather cut taxes 
for the ultrawealthy than repair Amer-
ica’s crumbling roads and bridges. 
Did you see that picture in the news? 
Of the bridge? I think it was in Ten-
nessee, on one of the interstates. It 
cracked so badly, they had to close it, 
close an interstate bridge. We remem-
ber just a few years ago in Minnesota, 
an interstate highway collapsed, tak-
ing American lives. It can happen and 
will continue to happen unless we do 
our part. That is not just bad policy; it 
is dangerous. 
I guess this is the picture that I 
brought to show what was happening 
with this bridge in Tennessee. You can 
see the crack in the steel girders there 
and the reason they closed the bridge. 
God forbid some other bridge is in that 
same shape and we haven’t discovered 
it or we won’t discover it soon enough. 
We need to put some money in our 
infrastructure. We count on it every 
day. People rely on the safety of these 
bridges and other facilities, and it is 
our job to make sure they are kept up. 
That is not just bad policy, saying no 
tax increases for corporations if it 
means paying for infrastructure that 
way; it is dangerous. 
Take a look at what happens when 
we fail to adequately invest in our in-
frastructure. That photo tells it all. A 
‘‘structural crack’’ they called it. That 
was found in a bridge in Memphis, TN, 
last week. Tens of thousands of vehi-
cles drive over that bridge every day. It 
connects commuters and commercial 
traffic between Arkansas and Ten-
nessee. If not for a scrupulous engineer 
who caught the crack, local authorities

said it would have led to a ‘‘cata-
strophic’’ result. Luckily, the catas-
trophe was averted. 
But now the people of Memphis and 
across America have a different prob-
lem. Repairs take time. That means 
the economic damage caused by the 
bridge’s closure is going to last for 
months. And it means that shipping 
and transportation networks will have 
to reroute for the foreseeable future. 
So it has a national impact on the 
economy, one bridge. 
Is this what we have come to in 
terms of infrastructure in America? 
Are we supposed to accept bridges 
hanging by a thread? 
This closure happened the same week 
that cyber criminals shut down one of 
the largest petroleum pipelines in the 
United States. Did you see the news-
cast? Did you see the lines of people 
and their panicked buying? They didn’t 
know if there would be enough gas to 
get to work, to get the kids to school, 
or in emergencies, so they went and 
filled their tanks, and we had a real 
mess on our hands. We saw the chaos 
that was created by that ransomware 
attack: cars lining up in every direc-
tion; people actually filling—and this 
is dangerous—plastic bags with gaso-
line. 
While it may have been a bridge in 
Memphis or a pipeline on the east coast 
last week, what is next? 
According to the American Society 
of Civil Engineers, 43 percent of our 
public roadways are in poor or medi-
ocre condition. Maybe that just means 
potholes and banging up your car or 
slowing down the traffic, but it could 
be worse. 
All of these signs point to the same 
conclusion: We are living on borrowed 
funds from a previous generation. We 
are using the infrastructure that they 
paid for because we don’t want to cre-
ate our own infrastructure. 
Cutting corners is simply not an op-
tion. That is exactly where we are 
going to end up if Senator MCCON-
NELL’s redline becomes the standard 
for deciding if we have infrastructure. 
And it is predicated on a failed eco-
nomic theory. 
The Republican approach—the so- 
called aptly named Laffer curve—be-
lieves if you just cut taxes on the 
wealthiest people, that will take care 
of the whole economy. Everybody is 
going to get well if the wealthiest have 
more money. I don’t buy it. 
It is time to wake up from the trick-
le-down fever dream. Look at where 50 
years of cutting taxes on the extra- 
wealthy has brought us: bridges on the 
verge of collapse; pipelines held for 
ransom; the most unequal economy 
since the Gilded Age in American his-
tory. 
The economic consensus is clear: Tax 
cuts on the wealthy have never created 
jobs. They have never boosted eco-
nomic growth. They just boost the 
banks accounts of the people who al-
ready have it. The benefits rise all the 
way to the top of the economic ladder 
and stay there. 
If we want to rebuild America, we 
need to invest in America. To do that, 
we need the wealthiest Americans and 
massive corporations to step up and 
pay their fair share. 
If you think you paid your fair share 
or more yesterday, how about the cor-
porations that paid zero on $40 billion 
of profit? 
President Biden understands this. 
That is why he has proposed the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan. It is going to grow our 
economy by putting millions of people 
to work rebuilding roads and bridges, 
like the Hernando de Soto Bridge. And 
it would make our crucial infrastruc-
ture more resilient to 21st-century 
threats like ransomware and cyber 
criminals. 
President Biden also has a plan to 
pay for these investments, unlike the 
Trump tax plan. To start, the Presi-
dent’s plan would raise hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars by holding tax cheats 
accountable and rolls back the tax 
breaks that encourage corporations to 
ship jobs overseas. 
This is something that boils my 
blood. Here is a corporation—and many 
of them have been located in my 
State—doing well, making a handsome 
profit, and expanding their business. 
They sit down with their counsel, law-
yers, and come up with a brandnew 
idea: Well, let’s just move our head-
quarters out of the United States, out 
of the State of Illinois, and put it in 
some foreign country. Think of how 
much we will save by not paying our 
fair share of taxes in the United States. 
We get all the benefits in this country. 
We use its infrastructure. We locate 
here. We actually live here. But we 
take a post office box in some faraway 
place and skip paying taxes to Amer-
ica. 
What a grand idea that is for some. 
For me, it is just deception and fraud. 
The only people who would see their 
taxes increase under President Biden’s 
proposals 
are 
those 
making 
over 
$400,000 a year. Now, if you are making 
over that amount of money and don’t 
want to announce it publicly, but you 
are sick and tired of DURBIN’s speech, 
get up and leave at this point. But if 
you are making under $400,000 a year, 
stick around because President Biden 
has made sure these tax increases will 
not affect you. 
Let me put it another way. We can 
fund President Biden’s infrastructure 
plan without raising a single tax on ac-
tual working families in America. How 
about that? Frankly, it is about time 
we balance the scales of our tax sys-
tem. 
During the pandemic, how did the 
richest 1 percent of Americans do? 
What was their struggle during this 
crisis? They saw, the 1 percent, saw 
their net worth increase by $4 trillion— 
not a bad year. 
If we want to get serious about cre-
ating jobs in America, everybody has 
to do their part. And this isn’t just 
about rebuilding our country. It is the 
next century of global leadership at 
stake. 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, this week, the Senate 
will consider the Endless Frontier Act, 
a bipartisan measure introduced by 
Senator SCHUMER, a Democrat, and 
Senator YOUNG, a Republican. It is pri-
marily focused on investing in Amer-
ica’s leadership in scientific and tech-
nological innovation and making sure 
those investments create jobs—good- 
paying 
jobs—in 
manufacturing 
and 
emerging industries. I am sure there 
are some worthwhile amendments that 
should be voted on, but I think it is an 
excellent example of the legislative 
process at work. 
With the Endless Frontier Act, Re-
publicans and Democrats are coming 
together to recognize that we need to 
invest in our capacity to compete with 
China and the rest of the world. This is 
one of our highest priorities. 
While this bill is a promising starting 
point, remember, it is just a starting 
point. I hope it is the beginning of a 
new bipartisan agenda for the future. 
We can’t afford to stand still. While we 
might not agree on every solution, I 
am sure we share the same goal—put 
America on track to win in the 21st 
century. 
I have listened carefully to many of 
my Republican colleagues who say 
President 
Biden 
is 
too 
ambitious, 
wants to invest too much money, and 
has too many big ideas. These Repub-
licans have a solid second-place strat-
egy for America. I don’t want to be 
part of that. 
This country can prosper and lead 
with the right inspiration. President 
Biden is bringing that to the table. 
That is what the American Jobs Plan 
is all about, President Biden is calling 
on everybody—everybody—to play a 
part in building that future. 
Let’s invest in America and create 
millions of good-paying jobs in the 
process. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Utah. 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise 
today to oppose the nomination of 
Kristen Clarke to be the Assistant At-
torney General for the Civil Rights Di-
vision. 
As I have said multiple times, I am 
not here to call into question Ms. 
Clarke’s motives, nor am I here to call 
into question whether she is a good 
person. In fact, I am willing to assume 
and even concede, for purposes of our 
conversation today, that she is a good 
person and that her motives are good. 
It is not my job as a Member of the 
Senate to go beyond that, but I do have 
some very serious concerns reflected in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2563 
May 18, 2021 
Ms. Clark’s record, concerns that, re-
grettably, she has failed to rebut. 
First, given the importance of the 
Civil Rights Division to the enforce-
ment of our Nation’s anti-discrimina-
tion laws, I am concerned about past 
instances in which she has publicly 
pushed the Department of Justice to 
not pursue egregious instances of voter 
intimidation. 
Ms. Clarke criticized the Department 
of Justice’s decision to prosecute Ike 
Brown for voter intimidation and sup-
pression. As a reminder, in that case, 
the case involving Ike Brown, a Mis-
sissippi Democratic official engaged in 
rampant vote manipulation and absen-
tee ballot fraud. 
Rather than praising the Justice De-
partment’s successful prosecution of 
the case, she criticized the decision, 
stating that some of the claims were 
‘‘weak.’’ 
When 
asked 
point-blank 
whether she agreed with DOJ’s decision 
to prosecute two members of the New 
Black Panther Party who, by the way, 
showed up to a polling place wielding a 
billy club, she demurred, saying: 
I believe the leadership of the Justice De-
partment had the prerogative to bring the 
cases that it deemed appropriate to bring. 
Well, that is a completely nonrespon-
sive answer. It is a little like saying 
Congress has the prerogative to pass 
the legislation that it deems appro-
priate to pass. 
In short, Ms. Clarke was unwilling to 
decry outrageous voter suppression and 
intimidation when Democrats were im-
plicated. She showed no corresponding 
hesitancy in challenging commonsense 
election security laws, like voter iden-
tification requirements, passed by Re-
publican State legislatures. 
Indeed, she has frequently challenged 
State election laws attempting to 
paint ballot security measures as cat-
egorically 
racially 
discriminatory, 
which raises the question: Does Ms. 
Clarke, in fact, oppose all voter intimi-
dation 
or 
just 
voter 
intimidation 
against certain groups? When the posi-
tion the nominee is applying for in-
volves being the head of the Civil 
Rights Division at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice—the very division that 
is responsible for overseeing voter 
rights laws—that is not a question that 
you want to have to ask. 
Second, Ms. Clarke has shown a trou-
bling disregard toward certain con-
stitutional rights. A few years ago, she 
decried the Trump administration’s 
creation of a Religious Liberty Task 
Force, saying that the goal was ‘‘to 
make it easier for people to use reli-
gion to mask their discriminatory 
goals. Shameful.’’ 
I would remind Ms. Clarke that the 
very first sentence of the Bill of Rights 
safeguards the very religious freedoms 
that she accuses of ‘‘masking discrimi-
natory goals.’’ 
Again, late last year, Ms. Clarke at-
tacked the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, say-
ing the Court’s ruling wrongly privi-
leged ‘‘religious freedom above all 
else.’’ 
Now, by way of reference here, just 
to set the context straight, that deci-
sion in the Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo sim-
ply stated that commonsense propo-
sition—one 
that 
is, 
in 
my 
view, 
unremarkable—that the government 
must treat mosques and synagogues 
and churches the same way that it 
treats liquor stores and acupuncture 
clinics. 
Statements like these give religious 
Americans like myself pause. Why 
should we believe that she will defend 
the civil rights, including the religious 
rights of all Americans, not just those 
with whom she happens to agree? 
Finally, I am worried about Ms. 
Clarke’s failure adequately to address 
her troubling history of inflammatory 
statements and irresponsible activism. 
In college, she wrote an article stat-
ing that ‘‘Melanin endows Blacks with 
greater mental, physical, and spiritual 
abilities—something which cannot be 
measured based on Eurocentric stand-
ards.’’ 
Not 
surprisingly, 
she 
was 
asked 
about this at the Senate Judiciary 
Committee hearing. And when she was 
asked about it at her hearing, she 
claimed this statement was meant to 
be satirical. But at no point—not dur-
ing the hearing, not in connection with 
followup questions for the record—did 
Ms. Clarke ever acknowledge the obvi-
ous; that these statements were unac-
ceptable, regardless of whether she in-
tended them to be satirical. 
Likewise, rather than express regret 
for her decision to participate and as-
sist in a conference defending cop kill-
ers and domestic terrorists in law 
school, she merely said that she ‘‘pro-
vided logistical support.’’ That con-
tradicts the statements made by nu-
merous speakers at the conference who 
personally thanked her for her efforts. 
In preparation for that same con-
ference, Ms. Clarke recommended that 
an article entitled ‘‘Mumia, ‘Lynch 
Law,’ and Imperialism’’ be included in 
the conference newspaper and discussed 
in connection with one of the panels. 
That article contains some of the 
most inflammatory anti-police rhet-
oric I have ever seen. Here is a quote 
from it, an actual quote: ‘‘The Klan is 
now the Police, with Blue uniforms re-
placing the sheets and hoods. The cor-
rupt racist Judges, are petty Klan ad-
ministrators.’’ 
When asked about her promotion of 
this article in her questions for the 
record before the Judiciary Committee, 
Ms. Clarke stated that she ‘‘ha[d] no 
independent 
recollection 
of 
that 
email.’’ 
Now, once again, we have here a com-
plete nonanswer. Ms. Clarke declined 
to explain, much less take responsi-
bility for, associating herself with ex-
traordinarily, 
obscenely 
dangerous 
rhetoric. 
Moreover, if Ms. Clarke were to be 
confirmed, she would be responsible for 
overseeing pattern and practice inves-
tigations of law enforcement agencies, 
which makes her unexplained, inexcus-
able involvement with anti-law en-
forcement activities all the more trou-
bling. 
I would also point out that the arti-
cle’s author, Amiri Baraka, was—like 
Professor Martin mentioned a moment 
ago—famously anti-Semitic. On one oc-
casion, he wrote, in reference to Jews, 
that he had ‘‘the extermination blues.’’ 
So, again, we have Ms. Clarke casually 
associating herself with a virulently 
anti-Semitic thinker. 
Ms. Clarke also denied on the record 
that she had served on the editorial 
staff of a college journal with Amiri 
Baraka. But a simple Google search of 
‘‘Kristen Clarke’’ and ‘‘Amiri Baraka’’ 
shows that when she was an assistant 
editor of that journal, Amiri Baraka 
was a contributing editor. Her denial of 
this easily verifiable fact is hard to un-
derstand. 
Now, let’s be perfectly clear. I don’t 
bring any of this up to suggest that all 
of it is unforgivable. Look, everyone 
has, from time to time, said or done 
things that they later come to regret, 
but let’s keep in mind what we are 
looking at here. Ms. Clarke, herself, is 
asking us to apply a very different 
standard to her than we have applied 
to others—a different standard, in 
many ways, than she has asked be ap-
plied to others. 
In 2019, her name appeared on a letter 
sent by the Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights, where she sat 
on the board of directors of that orga-
nization, opposing the nomination of a 
lawyer named Ryan Bounds, who had 
been nominated to serve on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
That 
letter 
stated 
that, 
‘‘[w]hile 
[Bounds] recently apologized for those 
comments’’—comments that had come 
up in connection with his confirmation 
proceedings—‘‘the timing of that apol-
ogy suggests it is one of convenience 
rather than remorse, offered in a last- 
ditch effort to salvage his nomina-
tion.’’ 
In her hearing testimony, Ms. Clarke 
provided no explanation for why we 
should overlook her extraordinarily 
controversial activities and statements 
while she was a student. Rather, she 
attempted to minimize or, in some 
cases, even evade her actions. 
Ms. Clarke’s history of irresponsible 
actions and words didn’t end with law 
school. In 2019, she signed a letter de-
fending Tamika Mallory, a woman who 
stated that ‘‘white Jews’’ ‘‘uphold 
white supremacy’’ and associated her-
self with Louis Farrakhan. 
When pressed on this point, she gave 
no explanation for her statement of 
support, other than saying that the let-
ter ‘‘denounce[d] . . . antisemitism.’’ 
Now, I am confused. How can a letter 
defending a woman accused of making 
anti-Semitic statements actually be a 
letter that is denouncing anti-Semi-
tism? Either anti-Semitism is bad or it 
is not. You can’t have your cake and 
eat it too. The way I read that letter, 
I don’t see the letter as saying, yes,

May 18, 2021 
that statement was bad, but there are 
other circumstances that should be 
considered. Instead, I see a whole-
hearted defense of the individual her-
self. 
Likewise, just last year, Ms. Clarke 
wrote an article titled ‘‘I Prosecuted 
Police Killings, Defund the Police—But 
Be Strategic.’’ 
When pressed about this by my col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee, 
Ms. Clarke, once again, sought to evade 
responsibility, saying that she has ‘‘de-
veloped a practice of being deferential 
to editors on title selection.’’ But I 
don’t think that is how this works. The 
article does, in fact, have her name on 
it. Even if she were deferential, the 
fact that she is describing herself as 
deferential here suggests that she did, 
in fact, make a conscious decision to 
defer. She didn’t say: I had absolutely 
no choice in it. I didn’t see the title. 
She just said that she adopted a prac-
tice of being deferential. 
In any event, you can hardly blame 
the editor for the title that he or she 
chose. Ms. Clarke wrote three times in 
that piece—three times—‘‘We must in-
vest less in police.’’ 
In short, Ms. Clarke’s record reflects 
a consistent pattern of inflammatory 
statements and actions, followed by a 
disclaimer of responsibility and a lack 
of candor and remorse. Moreover, her 
record gives us reason to doubt that 
she will defend the civil rights of all 
Americans, not just her political allies. 
For these reasons, I regretfully can-
not support her nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, very 
shortly, we will be voting on the 
Kristen Clarke nomination to the De-
partment of Justice. This week is an 
apt time to start the discussion about 
her nomination because it marks the 
anniversary of two of the most impor-
tant Supreme Court decisions in the 
history of America. The first is the in-
famous Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 
1896, wherein the Supreme Court estab-
lished a standard of separate but equal. 
That was the standard that was used to 
justify—legally 
justify—racial 
dis-
crimination 
throughout 
America. 
Sixty years later, in the landmark de-
cision of Brown v. Board of Education, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
unanimously— 
unanimously—rejected that shameful 
document and blazed a trail for the 
modern civil rights movement. 
This year, 2021, the Senate has a 
chance to continue America’s long 
march toward equality and racial jus-
tice by confirming principled, experi-
enced leaders to the Department of 
Justice. The Senate should work expe-
ditiously to consider and confirm these 
nominees. We have already confirmed 
Attorney General Merrick Garland, 
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, 
and Associate Attorney General Vanita 
Gupta. The next one in the order of the 
administration’s priority on hiring in 
the Department of Justice is Kristen 
Clarke. President Biden has nominated 
her to lead the Justice Department’s 
Civil Rights Division. 
Ms. Clarke is the right person to re-
store credibility to the Civil Rights Di-
vision. Under the previous President, 
the former Attorneys General Sessions 
and Barr, that Division was warped 
into a target and a tool to discriminate 
against marginalized Americans. Dur-
ing that previous administration, the 
Division 
rescinded 
guidance 
that 
strengthened 
protections 
for 
transgender students. They prohibited 
the use of consent decrees with local 
police departments that engaged in 
systemic misconduct. And they aban-
doned the longstanding principle of de-
fending Americans’ right to vote. Now 
we have an opportunity for a course 
correction in the Civil Rights Division 
by confirming a proven civil rights 
leader to head that Division. 
As a former trial attorney in the Di-
vision’s Voting Section and as a pros-
ecutor in its Criminal Section, Ms. 
Clarke has clearly played in the big 
leagues. She personally understands 
the role that the Division’s line attor-
neys play on a day-to-day basis. Ms. 
Clarke knows that these career attor-
neys must be independent from polit-
ical pressure in order to carry out the 
mission to defend the civil rights of all 
Americans, and her diverse background 
as a legal expert will serve her well. 
As the former codirector of the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund’s voting rights group, Clarke con-
fronted assaults on voting rights and 
ballot access, like those we are seeing 
in State legislatures across America 
today. As the former chief of the New 
York Attorney General’s Civil Rights 
Bureau, she helped establish the Office 
of Religious Rights Initiative, defend-
ing the First Amendment rights of 
workers throughout the State. 
You would find it hard to believe 
about Ms. Clarke and the issue of free-
dom of religion, based on some of the 
earlier statements made on the floor, 
and to then learn that she established 
the office’s Religious Rights Initiative 
in New York. Today, as the president 
and executive director of the Lawyers’ 
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, 
Ms. Clarke has spearheaded new initia-
tives to address civil rights issues cre-
ated by new technologies. 
She is singularly qualified to head 
the Civil Rights Division at this mo-
ment. She brings with her a wealth of 
expertise and experience needed to lead 
this Division at this moment in his-
tory. 
She also boasts broad, enthusiastic 
support from the law enforcement com-
munity. If you were on the floor and 
heard the statement previously made 
by the senior Senator from Utah, you 
would find it hard to believe that law 
enforcement 
would 
support 
this 
woman. Some of the things they say 
about her in criticizing her record sug-
gest that those in the law enforcement 
community are her natural enemies. 
The opposite is true. 
Throughout 
her 
decades 
of 
civil 
rights work—20 years of working in 
civil rights that included several years 
as a prosecutor—she has partnered 
closely with law enforcement. Many of 
them have publicly endorsed her, and I 
will get to that in a moment. Yet, if 
you were to listen to the arguments 
from the other side of the aisle—and we 
heard them in committee—you would 
think this amazing woman must be so 
gifted that she can engage in the prac-
tice of law for 20 years in the same the-
ater, including with law enforcement 
leaders from all over America, and 
somehow they never caught on to the 
fact, according to them, that she was 
virulently against law enforcement. In 
fact, they came out and said the oppo-
site. She was fair. She was objective. 
She was a good partner in trying to re-
solve difficult issues. 
They would have us believe that she 
has this mystical power to take people 
in law enforcement and delude them 
because secretly she is a radical, a So-
cialist radical. Not true. The partner-
ship she has had with law enforcement 
began when she prosecuted hate crimes 
in the Civil Rights Division, and it con-
tinues to this day through her work on 
the Lawyers’ Committee James Byrd 
Jr. Center to Stop Hate. This center 
provides community resources, train-
ing, and support for law enforcement to 
better identify, investigate, prosecute, 
and report hate crimes. 
In each of these roles throughout her 
history as a professional prosecutor at 
the highest levels in the United States 
of America, Ms. Clarke has earned the 
respect and trust of members of law en-
forcement, reflected in their strong 
support for her nomination. 
Listen to some of the groups that 
openly support her and then reflect on 
some of the charges that were just 
made against her on the floor by the 
Senator from Utah. 
She has support from the Major Cit-
ies Police Chiefs Association. She has 
the support of the National Organiza-
tion of Black Law Enforcement Execu-
tives. She has the support of Women in 
Federal Law Enforcement; the His-
panic American Police Command Offi-
cers Association; over 40 prominent po-
lice chiefs and sheriffs; and Sheriff 
David Mahoney, who just this month 
stepped down as president of the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association. 
Ms. Clarke’s critics would come to 
the floor and have you believe she has 
deluded all of them. She has deceived 
all of them. Despite the work they 
have done with her, she secretly can’t 
stand them. 
Well, it is not true. And it is not 
true, and they know it. I think the 
Senators on the other side of the aisle 
should know it as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2565 
May 18, 2021 
Ms. Clarke has the support of a bipar-
tisan group of former Justice Depart-
ment officials who wrote to the com-
mittee and said: ‘‘Ms. Clarke’s experi-
ence, in addition to her high character, 
make her a superior choice to lead’’ the 
Civil 
Rights 
Division. 
People 
who 
worked with her have endorsed her for 
promotion. 
Although Ms. Clarke’s record dem-
onstrates that she has devoted her life 
to advancing the civil rights of all 
Americans, in recent weeks, she has 
been 
the 
target 
of 
an 
incredible 
amount of baseless, vitriolic attacks. 
I don’t understand what is going on 
around here sometimes when I look at 
these nominations and wonder how 
people like her—Kristen Clarke, Vanita 
Gupta, and others—really enrage peo-
ple on the other side of the aisle, to the 
point where organizations are making 
concerted efforts to really twist and 
distort their life’s work, their values, 
and the talents that they bring. 
Listen to one of these attacks that 
was just made again on the floor of the 
Senate. The attack is that she person-
ally defended Mumia Abu-Jamal, who 
was convicted in 1982 of the murder of 
a Philadelphia police officer named 
David Faulkner. 
The attack is missing one key point. 
Ms. Clarke never—never—worked on 
the Abu-Jamal case. You wouldn’t 
know that from the charges made. 
But perhaps the most vicious attack 
against her is the false accusation of 
anti-Semitism. 
Now, I am not Jewish, and the Sen-
ator who suggested that she was anti- 
Semitic in some of the things that she 
had said and done is not Jewish either, 
but those who are of the Jewish faith 
have considered the charges made 
against her. Let me tell you what they 
found. 
They 
found 
these 
accusations 
couldn’t be further from the truth. Ms. 
Clarke has spent much of her career de-
fending the rights of Jewish Ameri-
cans. 
At the New York State attorney gen-
eral’s office, she repeatedly defended 
Jewish employees’ right to observe the 
Sabbath in the workplace. 
Does that sound like someone who is 
negative on the issue of freedom of re-
ligion or anti-Semitic? 
She has also been at the forefront of 
confronting the growth of anti-Semitic 
hate and harassment online through 
her work with the Lawyers’ Com-
mittee. For instance, she helped shut 
down a virulent White Supremacist and 
anti-Semitic 
website 
called 
Stormfront. 
Several Jewish groups have emphati-
cally denounced the baseless attacks, 
which continue to be made, even to 
this day, against this woman. 
Notably, the Union for Reform Juda-
ism, the Nation’s largest Jewish de-
nomination, wrote to the Judiciary 
Committee to voice unwavering sup-
port for Ms. Clarke’s nomination. 
Let me tell you what they said. 
‘‘We’ve heard the voices who have 
hurled accusations of antisemitism at 
Ms. Clarke, and we reject them. They 
do not comport with the career and 
record of the colleague we have worked 
with throughout her career.’’ 
These 
attempts 
to 
smear 
Ms. 
Clarke’s record are a last-ditch effort 
to discredit a nominee with exemplary 
qualifications. 
The bottom line is this: Ms. Clarke is 
the right person to lead the Civil 
Rights Division. It is a difficult assign-
ment. At any time in our history, it is 
difficult, probably more so today than 
ever. She is the person for the job. 
At this moment in history, our coun-
try needs her combination of expertise, 
experience, skills, and thoughtfulness 
to ensure the Civil Rights Division will 
again work for all Americans. 
If she is confirmed to be part of 
Merrick Garland’s team at the Depart-
ment of Justice, Ms. Clarke would cer-
tainly make history, being the first 
Black woman confirmed by the Senate 
to lead the Justice Department’s Civil 
Rights Division—the first. 
I look forward to supporting her 
nomination on the floor, as we con-
tinue this process, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote to discharge her 
nomination from committee and ulti-
mately confirm her to this critical po-
sition at the Justice Department. 
My assignment on the Senate Judici-
ary Committee is a challenging one. 
The committee is evenly divided 11 to 
11. There are some of the fiercest and 
strongest partisans from the other side 
of the aisle as part of this committee 
structure. 
I marvel sometimes at things that 
are said in the committee. When I look 
at the evidence—certainly when it 
comes to Ms. Clarke, her actual life, 
her career, her experience, and what 
she has done—it belies some of the 
baseless criticism that is made. 
I just wonder, What is it about this 
woman that drives some Members into 
a rage? I have met her. I have heard 
her questioned in the committee. I be-
lieve she has proven throughout her 
life that she is the right person to 
move up into this critical position at 
this moment in history. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
LOUISIANA 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today to bring attention to an on-
going situation in South Louisiana. 
Heavy rains are hammering our com-
munities. A state of emergency exists 
across the area, with more rain ex-
pected today. 
It has been a difficult 2 years, pan-
demic aside. Eight months ago, Lake 
Charles was devastated by Hurricanes 
Delta and Laura, one of the few times 
in history in which a hurricane fol-
lowed upon a hurricane, almost identi-
cally tracking. 
Yesterday, areas got anywhere from 8 
to 15 inches of rain in 12 hours. It was 
heartbreaking to see Lake Charles hit 
again by natural disaster. 
And this is 18 to 15 inches in 12 hours, 
and there you can see the impact of 
cars flooded up almost to their window. 
There is a home in the background, and 
you can see where the water level is 
relative to that home. 
And here we have another example of 
vehicles flooded, to give you an idea of 
how much rain occurred in a short pe-
riod of time. 
Now, other floods and disasters in 
parts of the country—often floods and 
disasters in parts of the country, other 
than the west and the east coasts, get 
overlooked. I am here to make the case 
to not overlook. We cannot ignore the 
pain and destruction left in the wake of 
these storms. 
Overnight, 80 people were rescued 
from flash flooding in Lake Charles. On 
top of the rain and submerged roads, 
there were warnings for possible torna-
does, prompting shelter-in-place pre-
cautions. 
I heard from constituents that stu-
dents were kept in schools until late 
into the night. 
Now, it is not just Lake Charles; 
Baton Rouge flooded as well. In Baton 
Rouge, more than 250 people were res-
cued after the city got a deluge of over 
13 inches of rain on Monday night. 
And this is Baton Rouge—not as bad 
as Lake Charles in that picture, but 
even more people had to be rescued. 
This morning, at least 15,000 homes 
and businesses were without power in 
East Baton Rouge Parish. 
The number of homes and businesses 
flooded in Lake Charles and Baton 
Rouge combined is not known, but I 
can promise we will continue to hear 
distressing and saddening stories about 
the loss of both life and property 
throughout South Louisiana in the 
coming days. 
Now, through firsthand accounts, so-
cial media posts, and local news cov-
erage, we have already heard emotional 
stories. In Lake Charles, a resident and 
their newborn had to swim to safety as 
water levels rose. In Baton Rouge, a 
body was found submerged in a vehicle 
that had gone into a canal. 
Water rescues and emergency evacu-
ations have been underway for the last 
24 hours, but Americans are at our best 
when we help those in need, and folks 
in Louisiana are resilient. 
So I give thanks to all the brave men 
and women of local fire and police de-
partments for their work in saving 
lives. We will get through this to-
gether. 
When I was in Lake Charles after the 
last hurricane, Hurricane 
Delta, 
I 
picked up a bracelet that read ‘‘Lake 
Charles Strong.’’ We are Lake Charles 
Strong; we are Baton Rouge Strong; we 
are Louisiana Strong. 
While some outside of our State have 
already forgotten about the natural 
disasters of 2020, Louisiana has not. 
Many have yet to return to their 
homes. 
Just 2 weeks ago, President Biden 
visited Lake Charles, talking about in-
frastructure in front of the Calcasieu

River Bridge. Well, when I met him, I 
raised the issue of a disaster relief 
package. 
Our State was hit by hurricanes and 
winter storms, as well as the pandemic. 
A record five main storms made land-
fall last year in my State. The strong-
est was Laura, a category 4 hurricane, 
hitting Lake Charles, followed by Hur-
ricane Delta, a category 2, just a 
month later. 
Louisiana farmers were also hit with 
catastrophic 
damage 
to 
livestock, 
crops, and structures during unprece-
dented winter storms. 
We need a disaster supplemental leg-
islation to help communities strug-
gling to recover. We cannot afford to 
allow the impact of an entire year’s 
worth 
of 
natural 
disasters 
to 
go 
unaddressed. 
Our best line of defense for these nat-
ural disasters is coastal resiliency, 
which in our State is funded through 
what is called GOMESA. That is rev-
enue from offshore oil and gas develop-
ment. 
And folks wonder why I fight so hard 
to preserve that funding for GOMESA. 
GOMESA allows Louisiana to rebuild 
our coastline so if there is a hurricane 
coming onshore, there is the resiliency 
from a coastline which is built out 
with wetlands to absorb the strength of 
that hurricane. 
We need to preserve GOMESA to con-
tinue having dollars flow not just to 
Louisiana but to other Gulf Coast 
States to protect against natural disas-
ters. 
It will be raining today and maybe 
longer, but to those—oh, one more 
thing to mention. 
There is a portion of the Presi-
dent’s—a portion of the President’s in-
frastructure bill which has not at-
tracted a lot of notice but which I 
would agree with. It is called nature re-
silience—using the natural structures 
of our coastlines in order to increase 
resiliency against water events and 
other events. 
And in a spirit of bipartisanship, but 
once seeing the necessity of it, I would 
support that provision as I now under-
stand it. 
So for all those in South Louisiana, 
please stay safe, listen to local officials 
for further instructions. 
I will continue to monitor the situa-
tion and help, as possible, with recov-
ery efforts. My office is in contact with 
the White House, ensuring the full sup-
port of the Federal Government is 
there to help now and then to help re-
covery. 
Our prayers are with those experi-
encing flooding and other hardships. 
We thank the American people for 
their support. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor this afternoon to talk 
about the economy, how to get it on 
the right track and particularly how to 
deal with the jobs crisis we face right 
now. It is a different kind of crisis than 
we normally talk about. There are a 
lot of jobs open, and the workers who 
are needed are not coming forward. 
Washington needs to change direction 
to get the economy on the right track. 
Current law provides that at least 
until Labor Day—that is in September 
of this year—there will be a Federal 
supplemental payment of $300 per week 
added to the State unemployment ben-
efit. So if somebody is on unemploy-
ment insurance, they will get their 
normal State benefit, which in Ohio is 
about half of whatever your income 
was, but on top of that, now there is a 
$300 Federal supplement. It was put in 
place during COVID–19, but it con-
tinues until at least September. 
By doing so, adding that $300, it near-
ly doubles the unemployment insur-
ance benefit, on average. It also results 
in about 42 percent of those people who 
are on unemployment insurance mak-
ing more on UI than they were making 
at work. It has the effect of, in most 
States, more than doubling the amount 
of unemployment insurance, and it also 
doubles the minimum wage. So you can 
imagine why this is a disincentive for 
some people to go back to work, if they 
can make more not working. 
On top of that, Democrats here in 
Congress, during the COVID legisla-
tion, added another benefit to people 
on unemployment insurance compared 
to people who are working, and that is 
to say that your first $10,000 of unem-
ployment insurance is tax-free. So if 
you are a truckdriver making 35,000, 
40,000 bucks a year, you don’t get that 
tax benefit, but if you are on unem-
ployment insurance, you do get that 
benefit—again, another disincentive to 
go back to work. 
People are logical. If the government 
is going to pay you more not to work 
than to work, it creates a problem. And 
you can see that problem. We have a 
record number of job openings right 
now; 8.1 million jobs are open in Amer-
ica today. 
The economic recovery we all are 
looking forward to is being hampered 
by what? A lack of workers. If you go 
down your Main Street wherever you 
live, you will see the ‘‘help wanted’’ 
signs up. If you go by your restaurants, 
you will see, instead of the marquees 
saying ‘‘Come and check out our great 
apple pie or our hamburgers,’’ they say 
‘‘We are paying signing bonuses’’—$500, 
$250. I went by a Frisch’s Big Boy on 
the way to the airport on Monday, and 
that is what I saw—McDonald’s offer-
ing a $500 bonus. 
There are manufacturers I know in 
the State of Ohio I represent offering 
much more in terms of signing bo-
nuses. I talked to a woman last week, 
who is a friend of mine, who runs a 
manufacturing company, a great little 
company, which has about 200, 250 em-
ployees. She is looking for 60 people 
right now. She is offering a $1,000 sign-
ing bonus plus other incentives, bene-
fits, to be able to come to work, and 
she can’t get people to show up to 
apply for work. So this is a real prob-
lem in terms of our interest in getting 
this economic recovery going. 
It is time to stop this extraordinary 
Federal unemployment supplement. By 
keeping in place this $300 per week on 
top of this UI benefit and not taxing 
that benefit, President Biden and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are putting us in a tough position and, 
I think, on the verge of a real jobs cri-
sis because some of these jobs will end 
up going away, some permanently, if 
we don’t do something about it. 
I believe the Federal unemployment 
insurance was necessary, the Federal 
supplement, when we were at the heat 
of the COVID–19 crisis—let’s say a year 
ago now. People were losing their jobs 
through no fault of their own. Their 
businesses were shutting down, in part 
because the government was putting in 
place social distancing guidelines or 
otherwise saying that businesses had 
to temporarily close. A lot of people 
lost their jobs. 
In my view, Congress rightly put in 
place expanded unemployment benefits 
to help those families get by when the 
economy was largely shut down, but we 
are in an entirely different place now, 
entirely different place. Again, 8.1 mil-
lion jobs are open right now. It is a his-
toric time. We have never had this 
many jobs open in America. 
Thanks to the hard work of a lot of 
our researchers and scientists, this 
vaccine has gotten out there at record 
pace. We now have had vaccinations at 
levels that we had all hoped for earlier. 
As a result, with more than half of 
Americans already having had one vac-
cination—in my State of Ohio, it is 
even better than that—restrictions are 
easing, and businesses are opening up, 
fully open again. In my home State of 
Ohio, there is no longer a mask man-
date. Here in the U.S. Senate is an ex-
ample. Things are opening up. With 
that reopening, again, comes all these 
job openings that can’t be filled. 
The economic recovery you would ex-
pect right now is not happening be-
cause people are not getting back to 
work. 
We just had the jobs numbers from 
last month. The country added 266,000 
jobs in April. This was alarming be-
cause it was only one-quarter of what 
the economists predicted, only 25 per-
cent of what people predicted. It is an 
early warning sign that should not be 
ignored. 
These disappointing monthly job re-
ports typically tell bad news on two 
fronts. One is that there haven’t been 
as many new jobs added as you would 
want, and that is certainly true. 
But second, it says there are not 
enough available jobs out there. There

aren’t enough open jobs out there. 
That is not the problem now. Adequate 
number of jobs is not the problem. The 
jobs are available. But if the President 
and Congress don’t change course, that 
could become a problem. If steps aren’t 
taken to dismantle some of the dis-
incentives to work, some of these 
record number of available jobs we 
talked about are going to go away. 
Let me give an example. There is a 
restaurant called Geordie’s in Colum-
bus, OH. They have closed down. 
Geordie’s is closed down. They can’t 
find workers. That is the reason. The 
owner was quoted as saying something 
like: You know, COVID–19 didn’t take 
me down. He got the PPP loan. He kept 
going, and he struggled through, and 
he was staying open. He said: My own 
government has taken me down, be-
cause he can’t compete with unemploy-
ment insurance at that level. 
We have lots of other businesses in 
Ohio. Here are some. Your Pizza Shop, 
Muddy’s, 
Donatos—all 
in 
Wooster, 
OH—have told me that they are closing 
down 1 day a week or more because 
they are understaffed. Facing no alter-
native, other businesses are figuring 
out ways to permanently move forward 
with fewer employees. 
This concerns me. In some cases, 
they tell me they are just downsizing 
their business. If you can’t find those 
60 employees and you are the manufac-
turer right now, what do you do? You 
are restricting your business. You are 
not opening new markets, and you are 
closing down maybe even some existing 
customers because you can’t serve 
them. So these jobs are going. Others 
are figuring out ways to do it with 
fewer people. Again, some might say 
that is a good thing—using technology 
and 
using 
automation 
to 
displace 
workers. I don’t think it is a good 
thing. I would rather have more people 
working. That is what they want, too, 
but they can’t afford it, so they are 
going to more automation, they tell 
me, going to anything they can do to 
do it with fewer workers. 
This is a problem, and again, Wash-
ington is creating this problem. Why 
would we do that? Again, I understood 
it and supported it when we had the 
COVID–19 crisis. People were losing 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own. But the opposite is happening 
now. 
We have to change gears. We are at a 
crossroads. We can continue to have 
this economy stagnate, continue to 
hurt working families, or we can get 
people back to work and create robust 
and sustained economic growth. 
I would take the $300 a week, by the 
way, and shift it to a 6-week temporary 
bonus of $100 a week to go to work, a 
work bonus. You could do that imme-
diately even while keeping the $300 in 
place for a short period of time be-
cause, right away, you could help peo-
ple to get back to work. It would hap-
pen. 
By the way, some States have de-
cided on their own just to get rid of the 
$300 because they know it is not work-
ing for the small businesses; it is not 
working for the economy; it is not 
working for individuals who are not 
getting back to their career track, who 
are losing training and losing the abil-
ity to keep up with what is going on at 
work because they are, again, given 
this disincentive to go back. 
It is working. There was a hotel, I am 
told, in the first State that decided to 
do this, which was Montana—did it 
about 2 weeks ago—a hotel where they 
were offering every week to hire more 
employees. They were looking for more 
employees. They were getting 1 person 
a week to show up; last week, 60 peo-
ple—60 people—because they are not of-
fering the $300 anymore. They are giv-
ing the money back. 
The Biden administration, as you 
know, would like to spend a lot more 
money on a lot of different things— 
that totals about $6 trillion when you 
add it all up—to prime the pump, more 
stimulus, get the country back to 
work, as they say. 
What has happened is, a lot of this 
stimulus money, particularly in the 
$1.9 trillion COVID package, has over-
heated the economy—and you can see 
it in the higher inflation numbers— 
which is what a lot of people predicted, 
including Democratic economists and 
former Secretary of Treasury Larry 
Summers. A lot of us on the Repub-
lican side were concerned about this. 
Well, it is happening. And we are see-
ing more and more proposals for more 
and more stimulus. Inflation is not 
what we need. 
By the way, that spending of $6 tril-
lion is about six times what the gov-
ernment spent during the New Deal in 
the 1930s, and that is inflation-ad-
justed. I mean, this is a lot of money. 
Instead, what we ought to do is help 
get people back to work and encourage 
them and let this economy grow on its 
own, which it is going to do. During the 
COVID–19 discussion, the Congressional 
Budget Office—a nonpartisan group 
here in Washington and Congress—told 
us that the economy is going to re-
cover to its pre-COVID level by mid-
year if we do nothing, no more stim-
ulus. Yet people insisted on more and 
more stimulus, and we can see what is 
happening. 
Part of that stimulus, part of that 
spending, was this $300 until Labor 
Day, $300 week per week in expanded 
unemployment benefits from the Fed-
eral Government, on top of the fact 
that you don’t get taxed on your first 
$10,000. Again, that $300 is on top of 
whatever the State benefit is. 
Are there other factors that are lead-
ing to this labor problem we have now 
in our country? I think there are. I 
think there are. One is that we have a 
situation now where some people just 
can’t afford childcare. So they are not 
only getting more money on unemploy-
ment, perhaps, than they are getting at 
work; if they go to work, they have to 
pay for childcare. And childcare is too 
expensive, and I would like to work on 
that. 
One of the reasons, we are hearing, is 
that schools are not open, so they have 
to use childcare because their kids are 
not in school. With only 54 percent of 
K–8 
schools 
actually 
being 
open 
today—that is the latest number we 
have—that is a real problem. Again, 
that is one we can solve. The CDC is 
playing a role in that by saying: Get 
the kids back to school. They can do so 
safely. There certainly should not be 
any reason for this now, given the fact 
that so many people have been vac-
cinated and, thank goodness, the infec-
tion levels are going down so much. 
So I know that is an issue. Childcare 
is an issue. 
The other issue, I think, that we have 
to know is that some people are con-
cerned about still getting infected at 
work and what the virus might, you 
know, lead to in terms of an unsafe 
workplace. But I will tell you, that 
concern is a lot less now. Again, so 
many people have been vaccinated, and 
the CDC again has responded to that 
and said: You can have a safe work-
place. You can have a safe school. It is 
not hard to do. 
So let’s get back to work, and par-
ticularly, let’s deal with this unem-
ployment insurance issue because that 
is the main reason people are not re-
turning to work, I am told by the em-
ployers out there. With more than 40 
percent of workers making more with 
unemployment insurance and that sup-
plement than they would in their jobs, 
businesses just can’t compete. 
Think how tragic this is. A small 
business owner works tirelessly to keep 
the lights on through COVID–19—again, 
maybe uses the PPP or otherwise and 
stays in business—and finally, after 
more than a year, reaches a point 
where the virus is in retreat—we are 
doing all the things we should be doing 
to make our workplaces safe—and now 
they might have to close because they 
just can’t find people to work. 
The same story is being told all over 
the country and certainly all over my 
State. Again, this is why 21 States now, 
as of this afternoon, including my 
home State of Ohio, have decided to 
give the $300 back. But we shouldn’t, 
here in Washington, continue to pro-
vide that $300 to everybody else. 
Governors in these States understand 
that encouraging workers to return to 
the job market is essential to the econ-
omy, but it is also good for the work-
force to get back to work, get back to 
what happens when you go to work, 
which is you have that sense of fulfill-
ment, that dignity and self-respect 
that come with work, and you are 
keeping up with whatever the techno-
logical changes at work are and getting 
back on your career track. 
Guidance from the Biden administra-
tion, the CDC, says we can move for-
ward with getting back to normal. It is 
time for President Biden to follow that 
advice and to end the disincentive to 
work that is holding back the eco-
nomic recovery. 
These are simple steps we can take. 
Again, I would do a $100 bonus to go

back to work for 6 weeks. But the most 
important thing is to end the $300 and 
to let people once again have the op-
portunity to pursue their American 
dream, which is not unemployment; it 
is getting a job. With 8.1 million jobs 
being offered—a historic number, the 
most ever—it is time to make that 
change. 
I urge my colleagues and I urge the 
administration to change course. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will 
not be voting to discharge the nominee 
Kristen Clarke to run the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice, 
so I come to the floor to explain to my 
colleagues why I feel this way. 
While Ms. Clarke may be a very good 
attorney—in fact, I don’t think there is 
any doubt that she is—she continues 
the trend of politicized nominees to the 
Justice Department under this Presi-
dent. While I disagree with her strong-
ly on some of her views, especially 
when it comes to defunding the police, 
my issues with Ms. Clarke go beyond 
that. 
The Justice Department and espe-
cially the Civil Rights Division need to 
be committed to impartial and equal 
justice. In the wrong hands, the Civil 
Rights Division can be used to target 
and harass the President’s political op-
ponents. It can threaten law enforce-
ment, school choice advocates, reli-
gious schools, red States, and pro- 
lifers. 
This isn’t a hypothetical. Under Ms. 
Gupta, the Civil Rights Division de-
fended an effort to take over Louisi-
ana’s school choice program. Now, can 
you imagine that? Luckily, a group of 
African-American 
mothers 
stopped 
them in the Fifth Circuit. Just think— 
African Americans stopped an obvious 
injustice by the Justice Department. 
The fact is that our civil rights laws 
are broad, and the mere threat of their 
enforcement can chill legitimate polit-
ical opposition. Because of that, I 
think that the head of the Civil Rights 
Division needs to be above reproach 
when it comes to partisanship. 
Unfortunately, Ms. Clarke is a liberal 
partisan. She has opposed the enforce-
ment of the law against Ike Brown, a 
Mississippi voter suppressor, either be-
cause of the color of his skin or be-
cause he was a Democrat. Neither an-
swer is acceptable. She has disparaged 
religious freedom groups like the Alli-
ance Defending Freedom. She has op-
posed important Supreme Court deci-
sions protecting religious liberty, indi-
vidual Supreme Court Justices, and 
even some of my colleagues. She has 
held Republican nominees to a stand-
ard she didn’t want to apply to herself. 
Ms. Clarke has run away from her 
record. I asked her at the hearing 
whether Mumia Abu-Jamal, the coun-
try’s most notorious cop killer, was a 
political prisoner, like someone said at 
a conference that she helped organize. 
She wouldn’t answer, telling me she 
was unfamiliar with the case. Given 
her youthful activism, I find that very 
hard to believe. Last summer, she 
wrote an article in Newsweek advo-
cating for defunding the police, but she 
insists the words on the page aren’t 
what she meant. I am sorry, but if it is 
not what she meant, then she shouldn’t 
have said it. 
I don’t think she is the right person 
for this job at this time. A nominee to 
lead the Civil Rights Division should be 
nonpartisan, should be independent, 
and should be upfront about her beliefs. 
Unfortunately, I think Ms. Clarke 
misses all three marks. 
As I have said, I don’t want to return 
to the Eric Holder days, so I will vote 
no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Good afternoon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Good 
afternoon. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I am adding a little 
stability and friendship to these august 
proceedings, I hope you realize. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
Mr. President, I know of no further 
debate on the motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
agreeing to the motion to proceed. 
The motion was agreed to.

(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call 
up amendment 1502. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHUMER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1502. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
going to speak on this amendment for 
a minute, then we will move to the mo-
tion to discharge Kristen Clarke. 
Mr. President, I have just filed a sub-
stitute amendment to the Endless 
Frontier Act that will pull together bi-
partisan legislation from across the 
Senate committees into a single com-
prehensive bill to restore America’s 
competitive edge. 
This new bill will be called the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act, and it 
will include bipartisan legislation from 
the Foreign Relations Committee to 
strengthen 
our 
alliances 
and 
hold 
China accountable for predatory trade 
practices; bipartisan legislation from 
the Homeland Security committee to 
invest in AI, cyber security, and poli-
cies to make sure American taxpayer 
money is used to buy American prod-
ucts; bipartisan legislation from the 
HELP Committee to protect our re-
search and invest in STEM; bipartisan 
legislation from the Judiciary Com-
mittee to bolster antitrust enforce-
ment; 
bipartisan 
legislation 
from 
Banking to sanction predatory behav-
ior from the Chinese Communist Party. 
And, very importantly, the substitute 
amendment will now include a historic 
$52 billion investment to make sure the 
United States stays on the cutting 
edge 
of 
chip 
production—semicon-
ductor chip production—which is essen-
tial for this country’s economy, includ-
ing our auto industry, our tech indus-
try, and our military. 
Again, this legislation will now in-
clude a historic and immediate infu-
sion of Federal money in the semicon-
ductor industry to boost domestic pro-
duction and shore up critical supply 
chains. 
This is a very big deal. It fits in with 
the concept of the Endless Frontier 
Act, and I am very pleased it will be in 
the bill. 
American manufacturing has suffered 
rather dramatically from a chip short-
age. We have all heard about auto 
plants in our States that are closed or 
operating in reduced capacity because 
they can’t get the chips. The shortage 
in our tech industry shows how vulner-
able our supply chains are. 
We simply cannot rely on foreign 
processors for chips. This amendment 
will make sure we don’t have to. 
America invented the semiconductor 
chip. We are still at the cutting edge of 
research, but fewer than 12 percent of 
them are made in America. And if this 
bill doesn’t pass, it will go down to 6. 
Other countries—notably, China—will 
become the leaders, not just in chip 
manufacturing and chip production but 
in the many industries that depend on 
chips. We cannot let that happen. 
The best way to do that is to add this 
amendment to the bill, which I have 
just done, and make sure it passes. 
The substitute amendment is dra-
matic not only in terms of chips but in 
terms of American investment in re-
search, in science, and innovation. 
When we invest in research and science 
and innovation, millions of good-pay-
ing jobs follow, and the American econ-
omy leads the world. Our failure to in-
vest will displace us from that position 
and all too soon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2569 
May 18, 2021 
All told, the substitute amendment 
will mean that the legislation we are 
about to debate is the product of a half 
a dozen Senate committees, with input 
from just about every Member of the 
Senate. This legislation, I am proud to 
say, is thoroughly bipartisan, and it 
shows. When our colleagues will work 
with us, we want to work together 
whenever we can. 
Now, these policies may sound com-
plicated, but they are propelled by a 
simple motivation—making sure the 
United States stays the global eco-
nomic leader. In the 20th century, 
American prosperity was anchored in 
our unmatched capacity for innovation 
and invention. Researchers at Amer-
ican universities and laboratories fash-
ioned marvels that changed the way we 
work, the way we communicate, and 
the way we live. American workers and 
businesses brought those innovations 
to a global market, producing the larg-
est middle class in the world and an al-
most innate optimism about the fu-
ture. 
Here, unfortunately, in the 21st cen-
tury, America is falling behind. Other 
countries are investing more in their 
economies and training their focus on 
beating the United States to the key 
technologies of the future. If we don’t 
step up now—now, not 2 years from 
now—and if we don’t step up in a big 
and bold way, we risk missing out on a 
generation of good-paying jobs, mil-
lions and millions of them. We risk 
ceding the mantle of global economic 
leadership to our adversaries. We risk 
losing the sunny optimism that has de-
fined the American character for gen-
erations. 
This is an issue where we can unite 
our country behind the goal of keeping 
America No. 1 in science and in tech-
nology, and this bill puts us a giant 
step closer to keeping America one 
step ahead for decades to come.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 
8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES 
CODE, OF THE RULE SUBMITTED 
BY 
THE 
EQUAL 
EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION RE-
LATING TO ‘‘UPDATE OF COM-
MISSION’S CONCILIATION PROCE-
DURES’’—Motion to Proceed 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, right 
now, Democrats are hard at work 
building back an economy that works 
for everyone, not just those at the top. 
We are committed to fighting for work-
ers. And we have big, bold ideas to do 
that, like establishing national paid 
sick, family and medical leave policies; 
rebuilding our childcare infrastructure; 
raising the Federal minimum wage to 
$15 an hour; ending the wage gap; and 
strengthening our Nation’s labor laws. 
But after 4 years of nonstop attacks 
on workers’ rights, it is also critical 
that we undo the damage done by the 
Trump administration. So I am urging 
my colleagues to join me in voting to 
overturn a Trump administration rule 
that imposed strict limits on the Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commis-
sion’s ability to address workplace dis-
crimination. 
The EEOC is a critical Agency. It is 
responsible for holding employers ac-
countable for following workplace dis-
crimination laws. And when they don’t, 
it is one of the few places a worker can 
go to make sure they get a fair hear-
ing, accountability, and justice. But in 
January, the Trump administration’s 
Republican Commissioners voted to fi-
nalize a rule that tipped the scales in 
favor of employers in EEOC’s process 
to settle discrimination cases. 
That rule gave employers access to 
information about the worker’s case, 
but not the other way around. It made 
it easier for employers to demand the 
identity of victims and witnesses, in-
creasing the risk of retaliation. And it 
was set to worsen the backlog of cases 
at the EEOC, forcing workers to wait 
longer for justice. Put simply, that 
rule was designed to make it easier for 
employers to delay or deny justice to 
workers who have experienced dis-
crimination on the job. 
We cannot accept a system that is 
designed to let employers get away 
with violating workers’ rights. So we 
absolutely cannot let this rule stand. 
Let’s overturn this rule and restore a 
fair settlement process for the tens of 
thousands of workers who file discrimi-
nation charges with the EEOC each 
year. 
This is a small but important step in 
the fight to build a more fair and inclu-
sive economy for all workers, and I be-
lieve every one of us who thinks work-
ers deserve to do their jobs free from 
harassment and discrimination can 
support this. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, I move to proceed to 
S.J. Res. 13. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The bill clerk read as follows:

IDAHO GOLD STAR FAMILIES 
MEMORIAL MONUMENT 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH 
and Representative MIKE
SIMPSON, I 
congratulate all those who worked on 
the completion of the Idaho Gold Star 
Memorial Monument to honor Idaho’s 
fallen servicemembers and commemo-
rate the enormous cost of our freedoms 
shouldered by their families. 
We commend the members of the 
Idaho Gold Star Families Memorial 
Monument Committee on their work to 
see this project through to completion. 
Bringing together the partners, volun-
teers, and many supporters to make 
the monument happen was no small 
undertaking. 
We 
extend 
a 
special 
thank you to the committee’s chair-
person, Gold Star mother Rebecca 
Webb, for leading the establishment of 
the memorial. You have turned your 
profound sorrow for the loss of your 
son, MSG Christopher Webb, and the 
grief of all Gold Star Families, into a 
profound tribute to the great strength 
and devotion of our Nation’s service-
members and their families. 
How great it is to reach the final 
stage in the transformation of a piece 
of Idaho into an enduring memorial. 
From the memorial’s large, central 
gold star symbolizing the great loss ex-
perienced by loved ones of fallen serv-
icemembers, to the inherent recogni-
tion of the service of those who laid 
down their lives for our country, the 
depth of your love is clear in every 
thoughtful detail. You honor not only 
the memories of your loved ones but 
also the lives of the servicemembers 
and families who served our country 
before them and those who will follow 
in their eternal footsteps. 
We are blessed to have this out-
standing tribute in Idaho and to be 
part of the network of Gold Star me-
morials nationwide. You have created a 
beautiful place of tribute to Gold Star 
Families, who give far more to our 
country than we can ever reciprocate. 
The Idaho Gold Star Families Memo-
rial stands as a lasting place for all 
Americans to remember fallen service-
members and the great sacrifice of the 
families who stood with them and will 
always love them.

NATIONAL LUPUS AWARENESS 
MONTH 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today in recognition of National 
Lupus Awareness Month. 
This is an important time to pause to 
reflect on what more we can do to solve 
the cruel mystery of this disease, while 
providing 
caring 
support 
to 
those 
across our Nation who suffer from its 
impact. Lupus affects around 1.5 mil-
lion Americans and 100,000 Floridians, 
including men, women, and children of 
all ages. It is a chronic autoimmune 
disease that is difficult to diagnose, 
and there is no known cause or cure. 
I want to recognize the hard-working 
Americans fighting to understand, edu-
cate, and find a cure for this disease, 
and I want to thank the Florida Chap-
ter of the Lupus Foundation of Amer-
ica for their work to raise awareness, 
support research, and conduct edu-
cation programs so every Floridian af-
fected by lupus can have an improved 
quality of life. 
I also want to thank the volunteers 
that 
generously 
give 
their 
time 
throughout the year to educate and 
help patients with lupus, including two 
outstanding Floridians: Anne Bright 
and Denise Brown. 
Anne Bright, who suffers from lupus 
herself, is one of the founding members 
of the Florida chapter and has dedi-
cated her life to growing the organiza-
tion and providing help to so many 
Floridians struggling with lupus. Anne 
leads the Butterfly Bash committee, 
which has raised over half a million 
dollars over the past decade. As a spir-
ited lupus advocate, she touches count-
less lives, providing hope, resources, 
and comfort to those affected by lupus. 
Denise Brown lost her 18-year-old 
daughter, Brooke, to lupus in 2017. 
Brooke had been diagnosed with lupus 
at the age of 12, and her courageous 
battle with lupus inspired her dreams 
to become a nurse. Unfortunately, 
Brooke never got to pursue those 
dreams. Denise honors Brooke’s mem-
ory every day by dedicating her life to 
raising awareness of lupus and its ef-
fect on people of all ages, especially 
children, 
and 
helping 
those 
going 
through the unimaginable stress and 
hardship of this disease. 
This 
Lupus 
Awareness 
Month, 
I 
thank the brave and hard-working vol-
unteers like Anne and Denise and the 
wonderful organizations in Florida and 
across the Nation working hard to im-
prove the quality for those struggling 
with lupus and getting us closer to a 
cure.

HONORING SEAMAN SECOND 
CLASS HOWARD SCOTT MAGERS 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, during Me-
morial Day weekend in my home com-
munity, a fleet of cars will depart a 
local funeral home and make the 25- 
mile trip to Merry Oaks United Meth-
odist Church Cemetery in neighboring 
Smiths Grove, KY. This will be the 
final leg of a journey that began over 
6,000 miles and nearly 80 years ago. 
U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class Howard 
Scott Magers was one of the 429 crew 
members who perished aboard the USS 
Oklahoma on December 7, 1941. Scott 
was 18 years old. The tragedy of his 
death was made ore unbearable because 
he was buried in a mass grave along-
side those of his shipmates who were 
also unable to be identified. 
Thankfully, beginning in 2015, new 
dental, 
anthropological, 
and 
mitochondrial DNA analyses were em-
ployed to identify those who had fallen

TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF DAVID 
MAHONEY 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to honor David Mahoney, sheriff 
of Dane County, WI, on his retirement. 
Throughout his long and notable career 
in law enforcement, Sheriff Mahoney 
has been a champion of those in the 
profession and an advocate of deep-
ening community engagement. 
After earning degrees from Madison 
College and the University of Wis-
consin-Madison, 
Sheriff 
Mahoney 
began his 41-year career in law enforce-
ment, all but one of which was spent in 
the Dane County Sheriff’s Office. He 
also graduated from the National Sher-
iffs’ Institute Executive Management 
Program and the FBI National Acad-
emy for Executive Management. Sher-
iff Mahoney’s distinguished career in-
cludes extensive experience in labor 
management, having served 12 years as 
a local, State, and national labor exec-
utive officer, including several years as 
head of the Wisconsin Professional Po-
lice Association. His leadership abili-
ties were recognized when he was ap-
pointed president of the National Sher-
iffs’ Association and the Badgerland 
Sheriffs’ Association. 
Sheriff Mahoney was elected as the 
52nd sheriff of Dane County in 2006. He 
won reelection in 2010, 2014, and 2018. 
As Sheriff, Dave led an organization of 
600 staff in a county spanning 1,238 
square miles with over 575,000 resi-
dents. He was a steadfast advocate for 
justice, safety, taxpayers, and the men 
and women in uniform who served on 
his team. 
During his tenure, Sheriff Mahoney 
worked hard to reduce recidivism and 
engage in partnerships to promote 
criminal justice reform. He is espe-
cially respected for his work in under-
standing the reasons people enter the 
criminal justice system and developing 
programming in a jail setting to ad-
dress these reasons. He has been a 
strong advocate for more humane con-
ditions in the county’s aging jail facili-
ties, including improving access to 
mental health and substance abuse 
treatment. He also expanded electronic 
monitoring programs to reduce a grow-
ing jail population and ended a costly 
program that transferred inmates to 
facilities in other counties. 
But Sheriff Mahoney is perhaps best 
known for his efforts to expand com-
munity engagement and rebuild trust 
between communities of color and law 
enforcement. Under his leadership, the 
sheriff’s office partnered with the Jus-
tified Anger Coalition, a local initia-
tive designed to eliminate racial dis-
parities and create opportunities for 
African Americans. He also served on 
the county’s Criminal Justice Council, 
which pursues reform across both the 
legal and penal systems. 
While Sheriff Mahoney is retiring 
from the Dane County Sheriff’s Office, 
he is not retiring from his dedication 
to safety and security. He will continue 
his leadership in his new role as the di-
rector of Strategy and Support in the 
Protective Services Division of Amer-
ican Family Insurance, and he will re-
main a strong voice in the commu-
nity’s pursuit of racial justice reform. 
I am proud to honor Sheriff David 
Mahoney’s four decades of protecting 
Dane County citizens with respect and 
grace, and I am grateful to call him my 
friend. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MAJOR AIMEE A. 
MACK 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to recognize MAJ Aimee A. 
Mack, U.S. Army, on the conclusion of 
her current assignment. Since May 
2020, Major Mack has served with great 
distinction as the legislative liaison for 
the 
Countermeasures 
Acceleration 
Group, which was previously known as 
Operation Warp Speed. Throughout the 
development, production, and distribu-
tion of the various coronavirus vac-
cines, Major Mack has been an out-
standing source of information for my 
staff and me, helping us understand a 
fast-moving and game-changing pro-
gram that is saving millions of Amer-
ican lives. 
I think we all need to pause and mar-
vel at the miracle that Operation Warp 
Speed fostered. Today, based on the 
successful foundational work of Oper-
ation Warp Speed, it is extremely easy 
for any eligible American to receive a 
coronavirus vaccine. So it might be 
hard to remember just how far-fetched 
that objective seemed when Operation 
Warp Speed was launched during the 
height of the pandemic, approximately 
1 year ago. At the time, many in the 
mainstream media doubted that a 
coronavirus vaccine could be produced 
so quickly. President Trump’s plan to 
make a coronavirus vaccine available 
by the end of 2020 was repeatedly ‘‘fact 
checked,’’ and leading political and 
medical figures viewed the program as 
either a low-odds gamble or a political 
stunt. 
This was the very difficult informa-
tion environment that Major Mack 
confronted when she was appointed as 
Operation Warp Speed’s legislative liai-
son in May 2020, but she was uniquely 
suited for the assignment. Like all of 
the best legislative liaisons, Major 
Mack had the confidence of her com-
manding 
officer, 
GEN 
Gustave 
A. 
Perna, and was meticulous in her pro-
vision of precise, detailed information 
to Congress. She is also a Nurse Corps 
officer, and her medical knowledge 
made her an exceptional asset to Mem-
bers of Congress and their staffs, par-
ticularly when it came to explaining 
the program’s revolutionary scientific 
and medical testing decisions, which 
were vital to finding, testing, and re-
ceiving emergency approval for three 
vaccines in record time. In this sense, 
Major Mack was not merely a source of 
information but of education. Thanks 
to 
her 
efforts, 
when 
the 
first 
coronavirus vaccines were adminis-
tered in December 2020, there was 
broad, bipartisan congressional con-
fidence in the vaccines’ safety and effi-
cacy because she taught our staffs and 
us what we needed to know. 
In the months that followed, as at-
tention shifted from the development 
of the vaccines to their production and 
delivery, Major Mack continued to pro-
vide regular and detailed updates for 
Members and staff. Again, I think we 
need to admire Operation Warp Speed’s 
achievement here: For the first time in 
history, vaccines are effectively going 
from conveyor belts to arms within 
days. Major Mack’s deep knowledge of 
the process and her outstanding work 
in sharing it with us bolstered congres-
sional confidence in the program. To 
put a finer point on it, when our State 
health departments needed the latest 
information on vaccine allotments and 
projections, we knew who to call—MAJ 
Aimee Mack. 
Major Mack will soon depart for 
Command and General Staff College at 
Fort Leavenworth, KS, and she will be 
greatly missed. I want to thank her for 
her exceptional service and thank her 
family as well—her husband, MAJ 
Jamaal Mack, and her children, Daunte 
and Alisa. I wish her every success in 
the future and sincerely hope we get to 
work with her again soon.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ANTHONY V. SANTINO 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a great American and 
an exceptional member of the United 
States Air Force. On this occasion, I 
believe it is fitting to recognize Lt. 
Col. Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Santino’s distin-
guished service and dedication to fos-
tering the relationship between the 
U.S. Air Force and this Chamber. 
Lieutenant Colonel Santino has dis-
tinguished himself through his profes-
sional character and leadership by 
serving this Nation in uniform. A lead-
er and expert communicator, he has 
provided exemplary service to our 
country while assigned to the Air 
Force Senate Liaison Office. Tony is a 
senior missileer, operating at the high-
est levels of America’s nuclear enter-
prise, ensuring the United States and 
its allies are strategically prepared to 
defend this great nation from external 
threats.

May 18, 2021 
Prior to his current assignment, 
Tony had the privilege of being an Air 
Force fellow for Representative LIZ 
CHENEY. In addition to his numerous 
and impressive professional accom-
plishments, it is worth noting he flaw-
lessly balanced his duties, evidenced by 
his ability to allocate personal time to 
selflessly volunteer as local neighbor-
hood math tutor, where Tony’s enthu-
siastic service empowered DC youth 
and inspired community partnership. 
His passion for not only the organiza-
tion he works for but also the commu-
nity in which he resides is unrivaled. 
As a legislative liaison in the Air 
Force Senate Liaison Office from No-
vember 2019 to May 2021, Lieutenant 
Colonel Santino expertly performed his 
duties without reservation. His stra-
tegic thinking and strategic foresight 
helped to strengthen and improve our 
national security. Tony accomplished 
this by utilizing his in depth Air Force 
knowledge 
with 
numerous 
engage-
ments between Congress and the De-
partment of the Air Force. During this 
assignment, Tony conducted congres-
sional engagements to provide Mem-
bers of Congress and staff insights into 
the Air Force we need and Air Force 
required to support the national de-
fense strategy. Tony transformed con-
gressional engagement norms amidst 
coronavirus limitations, leading more 
than 40 remote and virtual engage-
ments between Air Force senior leaders 
and U.S. Senators, exponentially in-
creasing 
trust 
and 
mutual 
under-
standing. 
Tony’s innovative efforts and trusted 
credibility on Capitol Hill enabled the 
passage of foundational legislation in 
support of Air Force priorities, secur-
ing more than $170 billion in annual re-
quirements and directly contributing 
to the stand-up of the United States 
Space Force. All of these conversations 
and engagements helped stakeholders 
understand the defense equities and 
impact on national security. Tony re-
mained engaged with Members of Con-
gress to ensure all were informed, ad-
vised, and educated on initiatives im-
portant to the Air Force and the citi-
zens of this great country. Due to his 
direct involvement and stewardship, 
Members of Congress were able to 
make informed decisions and ensure 
the Department of the Air Force was 
properly resourced and funded. 
After concluding this challenging as-
signment, Lieutenant Colonel Santino 
will move to his next duty station at 
Vandenberg AFB, where he will be the 
director of operations for the 576th 
Flight Test Squadron. Tony has sac-
rificed much in service to our Nation. I 
am eternally thankful for Tony’s self-
less service and superb work with my 
office and the Senate over the past 18 
months on issues important to the 
State of Iowa and this great Nation. I 
salute this American patriot whose 
selfless service has kept our country 
safe and strong. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE LINTON HIGH 
SCHOOL STUDENT RADIO PRO-
GRAM 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, as an-
other school year comes to a close, I 
want to recognize the students at one 
North Dakota school for their accom-
plishments in a remarkable program. 
Students in Linton operate my State’s 
first and only high school radio sta-
tion. KLHS AM 1620 is a full-fledged 
AM station that went live in 2017. 
Since then, it has given students 
hands-on experience in broadcasting, 
interviewing, and news writing. 
KLHS and now KLPS play rock, 
oldies, and country music and feature 
local weather, news, and sports. It is 
all done by the students enrolled in the 
Linton High School radio broadcasting 
classes who write and produce all pro-
grams heard on the air. While mas-
tering broadcasting, they also learn to 
operate a console board and other 
skills like speaking, articulation, pro-
duction, script writing, and inter-
viewing. 
These Linton students have also at-
tended the annual national conferences 
of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting 
System, and their accomplishments 
have 
been 
recognized 
with 
many 
awards. At this year’s conference, the 
Linton students took home 20 Golden 
Microphone Awards, in categories such 
as best promotional event, most cre-
ative show, best station logo, best 
sports play-by-play, and best website. 
I also want to salute the founder of 
the Linton High School program, long-
time 
State 
radio 
veteran 
Jay 
Schmaltz. The idea for a high school 
broadcasting program originated after 
he 
became 
the 
supervisor 
of 
the 
Emmons County alternative education 
programs. 
Today, 
it 
is 
the 
most 
popoular elective class at the school 
and remains the only high school radio 
station in North Dakota. 
Mr. President, there are many good 
jobs in broadcasting in North Dakota 
and around the world. These Linton 
High School students are receiving a 
head start in the professional world of 
communications and will be able to 
apply the valuable skills they learn in 
many directions in their future profes-
sions. I commend Linton High School 
for offering such a valuable program 
and Jay Schmaltz for his dedication to 
its success, and I congratulate the 
Linton High School broadcasting stu-
dents for recognizing the value of 
learning a skill that will benefit them 
the rest of their lives. I know we will 
be hearing much more from these 
broadcasting entrepreneurs for many 
years to come.∑

REMEMBERING ERNEST EDISON 
WEST 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Ernest 
Edison West not only served his coun-
try in the U.S. Army during the Korean 
war but embarked on a lifetime of serv-
ice, consistently demonstrating cour-
age, selflessness, and, above all, broth-
erhood. Orphaned at an early age, Mr. 
West was raised in a children’s home 
that stressed this important concept— 
a value that was repeatedly put to the 
test in the Korean war. Once, despite 
losing an eye under intense enemy gun-
fire, he retreated and saved two wound-
ed fellow soldiers and carried his in-
jured patrol leader to safety while kill-
ing three enemy combatants. In the 
immediate aftermath, he said he had 
no idea that he was even wounded and 
that his fellow soldiers would have 
done the same for him. 
President Dwight Eisenhower was set 
to award Ernest the Medal of Honor. 
His sense of brotherhood on full dis-
play, West initially declined, asserting 
that everyone was doing his duty and 
that all were equal to him. He reluc-
tantly accepted the Medal of Honor and 
was later awarded a Purple Heart. 
Fortunately, Mr. West’s selfless serv-
ice did not end with his enlistment. 
In 1954, he married Gwendolyn Staf-
ford in a nationally televised ceremony 
on an episode of the CBS show ‘‘Bride 
and Groom.’’ He and Gwen moved back 
to Wurtland, KY, along the Ohio River 
in beautiful Greenup County. There, 
Ernest would later serve as mayor and 
play a huge part in creating a State 
veterans cemetery, where he is now 
buried. 
Mayor West was admired for his will-
ingness to get his hands dirty—quite 
literally—like 
digging 
water 
lines 
along county roads. He coached youth 
basketball and football and used sports 
to pass along his strong sense of broth-
erhood. How can we even measure the 
impact he made on all of those young 
lives? 
Ernest Edison West, who was born in 
Russell, KY, on September 2, 1931, died 
this year on May 1, at the age of 89. 
While his daughter, Amy Hogsett, his 
many grandchildren, his community, 
and the Commonwealth are saddened 
to say goodbye to this extraordinary 
man, we are not left emptyhanded. We 
are left with a powerful example of 
brotherhood lived out.∑

S. RES. 219 
Whereas Court Appointed Special Advocate 
(referred to this preamble as ‘‘CASA’’) and 
Guardian ad Litem (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘GAL’’) volunteers are trained and 
qualified to advocate nationwide for the best 
interests of children before courts in cases 
with allegations of abuse or neglect; 
Whereas more than 424,000 children in the 
United States enter the foster care system, 
through no fault of their own, due to allega-
tions of abuse or neglect and rely on adults 
to advocate on their behalf; 
Whereas children of color are more likely 
to stay in the foster care system for longer

periods of time and are less likely to be re-
united with their biological families; 
Whereas CASA and GAL volunteers, ap-
pointed by a judge— 
(1) provide the court with the comprehen-
sive and objective information the court 
needs to make the most well-informed deci-
sions and help ensure positive outcomes for 
children and youth; and 
(2) take time to build meaningful and au-
thentic relationships with such children and 
youth; 
Whereas CASA and GAL communities 
across the country remain committed to the 
recruitment and retention of volunteers who 
reflect the diversity of the children they 
serve; 
Whereas research shows that when a caring 
and consistent adult like a CASA or GAL 
volunteer is assigned to a case, outcomes are 
strengthened for children and families, a 
higher number of services are ordered, and 
children are significantly less likely to reen-
ter the child welfare system, perform better 
academically and behaviorally, and have 
higher levels of hope; 
Whereas, in January 1974, Congress enacted 
the Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act 
(42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.); 
Whereas the Child Abuse Prevention Treat-
ment Act provides financial assistance to 
States for the prevention and treatment of 
child abuse and neglect and includes a re-
quirement that in every case a GAL must be 
appointed to represent the best interest of 
the child; 
Whereas such GAL requirement was subse-
quently amended to provide that the GAL 
may be an attorney or a court-appointed spe-
cial advocate; and 
Whereas, today, CASA and GAL volunteers 
span 49 States and the District of Columbia, 
including 948 State organizations and local 
programs, and more than 96,000 volunteers 
offer their services to nearly 277,000 children, 
youth, and families: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 18, 2021, as ‘‘National 
CASA/GAL Volunteers’ Day’’; and 
(2) commends and celebrates CASA and 
GAL volunteers for their dedication and hard 
work in advocating for the best interest of 
children so that every child who has experi-
enced abuse or neglect can be safe, have a 
permanent home, and have the opportunity 
to thrive.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
220—CALL-
ING UPON THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE TO GIVE ITS ADVICE 
AND CONSENT TO THE RATIFICA-
TION OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF 
THE SEA 
Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, and Mr. KAINE) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 220 
Whereas the United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted 
by the Third United Nations Conference on 
the Law of the Sea in December 1982 and en-
tered into force in November 1994 to estab-
lish a treaty regime to govern activities on, 
over, and under the world’s oceans; 
Whereas the UNCLOS builds on four 1958 
Law of the Sea conventions to which the 
United States is a party, namely the Conven-
tion on the Territorial Sea and the Contig-
uous Zone, the Convention on the High Seas, 
the Convention on the Continental Shelf, 
and the Convention on Fishing and Con-
servation of the Living Resources of the 
High Seas; 
Whereas the UNCLOS and an associated 
1994 agreement relating to implementation 
of the treaty were transmitted to the Senate 
on October 6, 1994, and, in the absence of Sen-
ate advice and consent to ratification, the 
United States is not a party to the treaty or 
the associated 1994 agreement; 
Whereas the treaty has been ratified by 167 
parties, which includes 166 countries and the 
European Union, but not the United States; 
Whereas the United States, like most other 
countries, maintains that coastal States 
under the UNCLOS have the right to regu-
late economic activities in their Exclusive 
Economic Zones (EEZs), but do not have the 
right to regulate foreign military activities 
in their EEZs; 
Whereas the treaty’s provisions relating to 
navigational rights, including navigational 
rights in EEZs, reflect the diplomatic posi-
tion of the United States on the issue dating 
back to the adoption of the UNCLOS in 1982; 
Whereas becoming a party to the treaty 
would codify the United States’ current posi-
tion of recognizing the provisions within the 
UNCLOS as customary international law; 
Whereas becoming a party to the treaty 
would give the United States standing to 
participate in discussions relating to the 
treaty and thereby improve the ability of the 
United States to intervene as a full party to 
disputes relating to navigational rights and 
to defend United States interpretations of 
the treaty’s provisions, including those re-
lating to whether coastal States have a right 
under the UNCLOS to regulate foreign mili-
tary activities in their EEZs; 
Whereas 
relying 
on 
customary 
inter-
national norms to defend United States in-
terests in those issues is not sufficient, be-
cause customary international law is not 
universally accepted and is subject to change 
over time based on state practice; 
Whereas relying on other countries to as-
sert claims on behalf of the United States at 
the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The 
Hague is woefully insufficient to defend and 
uphold United States sovereign rights and 
interests; 
Whereas the Permanent Court of Arbitra-
tion, in the July 12, 2016, ruling on the case 
In the Matter of the South China Sea Arbi-
tration, stated that ‘‘the Tribunal forwarded 
to the Parties for their comment a Note 
Verbale from the Embassy of the United 
States of America, requesting to send a rep-
resentative to observe the hearing’’, and 
‘‘the Tribunal communicated to the Parties 
and the U.S. Embassy that it had decided 
that ‘only interested States parties to the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea will be admitted as observers’ and 
thus could not accede to the U.S. request’’; 
Whereas, on November 25, 2018, the Russian 
Federation violated international norms and 
binding agreements, including the UNCLOS, 
in firing upon, ramming, and seizing Ukrain-
ian vessels and crews attempting to pass 
through the Kerch Strait; 
Whereas, on May 25, 2019, the International 
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in a 
vote of 19–1 that ‘‘[t]he Russian Federation 
shall immediately release the Ukrainian 
naval vessels Berdyansk, Nikopol and Yani 
Kapu, and return them to the custody of 
Ukraine’’ and that ‘‘[t]he Russian Federation 
shall immediately release the 24 detained 
Ukrainian servicemen and allow them to re-
turn to Ukraine’’, demonstrating the Tribu-
nal’s rejection of the Russian Federation’s 
arguments in that matter in relation to the 
Law of the Sea; 
Whereas, despite the Tribunal’s ruling 
aligning with the position of the United 
States Government on the November 25, 2018, 
incident, the continued nonparticipation of 
the United States in the UNCLOS limits the 
ability of the United States to effectively re-
spond to the Russian Federation’s actions 
and to any potential future violations by the 
Russian Federation and any other signatory 
of UNCLOS; 
Whereas the current Secretary of Defense, 
the Honorable Lloyd Austin, stated that 
‘‘the United States has long treated the 
UNCLOS’s provisions related to navigation 
and overflight as reflective of longstanding 
and customary international law. Our mili-
tary already acts in a manner consistent 
with these rights and freedoms, so accession 
to the Convention will not impact the man-
ner in which we conduct our operations’’, in 
response to a question for the record from 
Senator Hirono on January 21, 2021; 
Whereas the current Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Michael Gilday, stated that 
‘‘becoming a party to the Convention would 
reinforce freedom of the seas and the naviga-
tional rights vital to our global force posture 
in the world’s largest maneuver space. Join-
ing the Convention would also demonstrate 
our commitment to the rule of law, and 
strengthen our credibility with other Con-
vention parties’’, in response to advance pol-
icy questions on July 30, 2019, before the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the current Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Michael Gilday, further stat-
ed that ‘‘acceding to the Convention would 
strengthen our strategic position on issues 
pertaining to the [South China Sea and the 
Arctic]. The United States would have in-
creased credibility when responding to exces-
sive maritime claims and militarization ef-
forts in the South China Sea. With respect to 
the Arctic, becoming a party to the Conven-
tion would allow the U.S. to position itself 
to safeguard access for the purposes of mari-
time traffic, resource exploitation, and other 
human 
activities, 
while 
ensuring 
other 
states comply with the law of the sea’’, in re-
sponse to advance policy questions on July 
30, 2019, before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the current Commander of the 
United States Indo-Pacific Command, Admi-
ral John C. Aquilino, stated that ‘‘there’s 
really two main reasons [to ratify the 
UNCLOS]: as the group gets together, it 
would be certainly beneficial if we had a seat 
at the table when there were discussions oc-
curring as it applied to potential adjust-
ments and the interpretations of those inter-
national laws and the second reason is it 
puts us in an increased position of credibility 
. . . we adhere to the UNCLOS treaty in our 
operations, and it would make our position 
must stronger if we were signatories’’, on 
March 23, 2021, at his nomination hearing be-
fore the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate; 
Whereas the Commander, North American 
Aerospace Defense Command and United 
States Northern Command, General Glen 
VanHerck, stated, ‘‘It would be [in the inter-
ests of the United States to accede to the 
UNCLOS because] it gives us a better pos-
ture, a seat at the table, more credibility 
when we work many of the issues that we 
have to work around the globe with allies, 
partners, and potential competitors’’, on 
March 16, 2021, before the Committee on 
Armed Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the Commander, North American 
Aerospace Defense Command and United 
States Northern Command, General Glen 
VanHerck, further stated in regard to United 
States ratification of the UNCLOS that ‘‘as 
Russia takes over the Arctic Council in May 
[2021], it’s never been more crucial for us 
with our like-minded nations and allies and 
partners that we come to agreement to not 
allow Russia and China to exploit any seams

mittee on Armed Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the Commander, North American 
Aerospace Defense Command and United 
States Northern Command, General Glen 
VanHerck, stated ‘‘I support the accession to 
UNCLOS. I think it puts us in a more stra-
tegic position when we address these issues 
internationally, globally, with competitors 
or our allies and partners as well’’, on April 
14, 2021, before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the House of Representatives; 
Whereas the Commander, United States 
European Command, General Tod Wolters, 
answered in the affirmative under ques-
tioning from Congressman Joe Courtney on 
whether 
General 
Wolters 
supported 
the 
United States becoming a full participant to 
the UNCLOS, on April 15, 2021, before the 
Committee on Armed Services of the House 
of Representatives; 
Whereas the past Commander of United 
States Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil-
ip S. Davidson, stated that ‘‘our accession to 
the UNCLOS would help our position legally 
across the globe and would do nothing to 
limit our military operations in the manner 
in which we’re conducting them now’’, on 
April 17, 2018, before the Committee on 
Armed Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the past Commander of United 
States Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil-
ip S. Davidson, further stated, ‘‘I’m on 
record saying that [ratification of the 
UNCLOS] would be good for us, I think we 
would be hard-pressed to find a Navy Admi-
ral that’s said otherwise’’, on March 9, 2021, 
before the Committee on Armed Services of 
the Senate; 
Whereas the past Commander of United 
States Pacific Command, retired Admiral 
Harry B. Harris, stated ‘‘I believe that 
UNCLOS gives Russia the potential to, 
quote, unquote ‘own’ almost half of the Arc-
tic Circle, and we will not have that oppor-
tunity because of, we’re not a signatory to 
UNCLOS’’, on March 15, 2018, before the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate; 
and 
Whereas the past Commander of United 
States Pacific Command, Admiral Harry B. 
Harris, stated ‘‘I think that by not signing 
onto it that we lose the creditability for the 
very same thing that we’re arguing for’’, and 
‘‘which is the following—accepting rules and 
norms in the international arena. The 
United States is a beacon—we’re a beacon on 
a hill but I think that light is brighter if we 
sign on to UNCLOS’’, on February 23, 2016, at 
a hearing before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the past Secretary of the Navy, 
the Honorable Ray Mabus, stated that ‘‘the 
UNCLOS treaty guarantees rights such as in-
nocent passage through territorial seas; 
transit passage through, under and over 
international straits; and the laying and 
maintaining of submarine cables’’, and ‘‘the 
convention has been approved by nearly 
every maritime power and all the permanent 
members of the UN Security Council, except 
the United States’’, on February 16, 2012, be-
fore the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate; 
Whereas the past Secretary of the Navy, 
the Honorable Ray Mabus, further stated, 
‘‘Our notable absence as a signatory weakens 
our position with other nations, allowing the 
introduction of expansive definitions of sov-
ereignty on the high seas that undermine 
our ability to defend our mineral rights 
along our own continental shelf and in the 
Arctic.’’ and that ‘‘the Department strongly 
supports the accession to UNCLOS, an action 
consistently recommended by my prede-
cessors of both parties’’, on February 16, 2012, 
before the Committee on Armed Services of 
the Senate; 
Whereas the past Chairman of the Joints 
Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph F. Dunford, 
stated, ‘‘The Convention provides legal cer-
tainty in the world’s largest maneuver 
space.’’, that ‘‘access would strengthen the 
legal foundation for our ability to transit 
through 
international 
straits 
and 
archipelagic waters; preserve our right to 
conduct military activities in other coun-
tries’ Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) 
without notice or permission; reaffirm the 
sovereign immunity of warships; provide a 
framework to counter excessive maritime 
claims; and preserve or operations and intel-
ligence-collection activities’’, and ‘‘joining 
the Convention would also demonstrate our 
commitment to the rule of law, strengthen 
our credibility among those nations that are 
already party to the Convention, and allow 
us to bring the full force of our influence in 
challenging excessive maritime claims’’, on 
July 9, 2015, before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the past Chairman of the Joints 
Chief of Staff, General Joseph F. Dunford, 
further stated that ‘‘by remaining outside 
the Convention, the United States remains 
in scarce company with Iran, Venezuela, 
North Korea, and Syria’’ and ‘‘by failing to 
join the Convention, some countries may 
come to doubt our commitment to act in ac-
cordance with international law’’, on July 9, 
2015, before the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate; 
Whereas the past President and Chief Exec-
utive Officer of the United States Chamber 
of Commerce, Mr. Thomas J. Donahue, stat-
ed that ‘‘we support joining the Convention 
because it is in our national interest—both 
in our national security and our economic 
interests’’, ‘‘becoming a party to the Treaty 
benefits the U.S. economically by providing 
American companies the legal certainty and 
stability they need to hire and invest’’, and 
‘‘companies will be hesitant to take on the 
investment risk and cost to explore and de-
velop the resources of the sea—particularly 
on the extended continental shelf (ECS)— 
without the legal certainty and stability ac-
cession to LOS provides’’, on June 28, 2012, 
before the Committee on Foreign Relations 
of the Senate; 
Whereas the past President and Chief Exec-
utive Officer of the United States Chamber 
of Commerce, Mr. Thomas J. Donahue, fur-
ther stated that ‘‘the benefits of joining cut 
across many important industries including 
telecommunications, mining, shipping, and 
oil and natural gas’’, and ‘‘joining the Con-
vention will provide the U.S. a critical voice 
on maritime issues—from mineral claims in 
the Arctic to how International Seabed Au-
thority (ISA) funds are distributed’’, on June 
28, 2012, before the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate; 
Whereas the past Commandant of the 
United States Coast Guard, retired Admiral 
Paul Zukunft, stated on February 12, 2016, 
‘‘With the receding of the icepack, the Arctic 
Ocean has become the focus of international 
interest.’’, ‘‘All Arctic states agree that the 
Law of the Sea Convention is the governing 
legal regime for the Arctic Ocean . . . yet, 
we remain the only Arctic nation that has 
not ratified the very instrument that pro-
vides this accepted legal framework gov-
erning the Arctic Ocean and its seabed.’’, and 
‘‘Ratification of the Law of the Sea Conven-
tion supports our economic interests, envi-
ronmental protection, and safety of life at 
sea, especially in the Arctic Ocean.’’; 
Whereas the past Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral John M. Richardson, stated 
that ‘‘acceding to the Convention would 
strengthen our credibility and strategic posi-
tion’’, and ‘‘we undermine our leverage by 
not signing up to the same rule book by 
which we are asking other countries to ac-
cept’’, on July 30, 2015, in his nomination 
hearing before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate; 
Whereas the past Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral John M. Richardson, further 
stated that ‘‘becoming a part of [the 
UNCLOS] would give us a great deal of credi-
bility, and particularly as it pertains to the 
unfolding opportunities in the Arctic’’, and 
‘‘this provides a framework to adjudicate 
disputes’’, on July 30, 2015, in his nomination 
hearing before the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate; and 
Whereas the past United States Special 
Representative of State for the Arctic and 
former Commandant of the Coast Guard, Ad-
miral Robert Papp, Jr., stated that ‘‘as a 
non-party to the Law of the Sea Convention, 
the U.S. is at a significant disadvantage rel-
ative to the other Arctic Ocean coastal 
States’’, ‘‘those States are parties to the 
Convention, and are well along the path to 
obtaining legal certainty and international 
recognition of their Arctic extended conti-
nental shelf’’, and ‘‘becoming a Party to the 
Law of the Sea Convention would allow the 
United States to fully secure its rights to 
the continental shelf off the coast of Alaska, 
which is likely to extend out to more than 
600 nautical miles’’, on December 10, 2014, be-
fore the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, 
and Emerging Threats of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs of the House of Representa-
tives: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms that it is in the national inter-
est for the United States to become a formal 
signatory of the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), done at 
Montego Bay December 10, 1982; 
(2) urges the United States Senate to give 
its advice and consent to the ratification of 
the UNCLOS; and 
(3) recommends the ratification of the 
UNCLOS remain a top priority for the Fed-
eral Government, the importance of which 
was most recently underscored by the stra-
tegic challenges the United States faces in 
the Asia-Pacific, the Arctic, and the Black 
Sea regions.

SENATE RESOLUTION 221—RECOG-
NIZING THE CULTURAL AND HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
CINCO DE MAYO HOLIDAY 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
CORNYN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 221 
Whereas May 5, or ‘‘Cinco de Mayo’’ in 
Spanish, is celebrated each year as a date of 
importance by Mexican and Mexican-Amer-
ican communities; 
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday com-
memorates May 5, 1862, the date on which 
Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle 
of Puebla, one of the many battles that the 
Mexican people won in their long and brave 
fight for independence, freedom, and democ-
racy; 
Whereas the victory of Mexico over France 
at Puebla represented a historic triumph for 
the Mexican government during the Franco- 
Mexican war fought between 1861 and 1867 
and bolstered the resistance movement; 
Whereas the success of Mexico at the Bat-
tle of Puebla reinvigorated the spirits of the 
Mexican people and provided a renewed sense 
of unity and strength; 
Whereas the French army, which had not 
experienced defeat against any of the finest 
troops of Europe in more than half a cen-
tury, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands 
of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but

highly spirited and courageous, Mexican 
army; 
Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexi-
can General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men 
displayed during that historic battle can 
never be forgotten; 
Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo 
symbolizes the right of a free people to self- 
determination, just as Benito Juarez, the 
president of Mexico during the Battle of 
Puebla, once said, ‘‘El respeto al derecho 
ajeno es la paz’’, meaning ‘‘respect for the 
rights of others is peace’’; 
Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters 
was instrumental in keeping Mexico from 
falling under European domination while, in 
the United States, the Union Army battled 
Confederate forces in the Civil War; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder that the foundation of the United 
States was built by people from many coun-
tries and diverse cultures who were willing 
to fight and die for freedom; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a re-
minder of the close ties between the people 
of Mexico and the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the 
celebration of a legacy of strong leaders and 
a sense of vibrancy in communities; and 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder to provide more opportunity for fu-
ture generations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historic struggle of the 
people of Mexico for independence and free-
dom, which Cinco de Mayo commemorates; 
and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Cinco de Mayo with appro-
priate ceremonies and activities. 
f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 222— 
OFFICIAL TITLE NOT AVAILABLE 
Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 222 
Whereas the Senate is committed to the 
awareness, prevention, and deterrence of sex-
ual violence affecting individuals in the 
United States; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’), 1 in 4 women 
and 1 in 10 men experience sexual or physical 
violence and stalking by an intimate part-
ner; 
Whereas, according to the 2019 Child Mal-
treatment Report of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, child protection 
service agencies throughout the United 
States substantiated, or found strong evi-
dence to indicate that, 60,927 children under 
18 years of age were victims of sexual abuse 
that year; 
Whereas children and young adults are at 
significant risk of experiencing sexual as-
sault, as up to 69 percent of sexual assault 
victims are under 34 years of age; 
Whereas sexual violence is a burden for 
many individuals who serve in the Armed 
Forces, and the Department of Defense esti-
mates that approximately 20,500 members of 
the Armed Forces, including approximately 
13,000 women and 7,500 men, experienced 
some form of contact or penetrative sexual 
assault during 2018; 
Whereas, due to the unprecedented chal-
lenges presented by the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, including manda-
tory stay-at-home orders, the needs of sexual 
assault victims have become even more com-
plex and challenging; 
Whereas, according to a March 2020 survey 
by the National Alliance to End Sexual Vio-
lence, 62 percent of rape crisis centers have a 
waiting list for counseling services, 35 per-
cent lack a therapist on staff, and 40 percent 
of programs have an increased demand for 
services since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas the American Journal of Emer-
gency Medicine reported a 10 to 30 percent 
increase in reports of family violence since 
the beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas sexual assault does not discrimi-
nate on any basis and can affect any indi-
vidual in the United States; 
Whereas sexual violence may take many 
forms, 
including 
acquaintance, 
stranger, 
spousal, and gang rape, incest, child sexual 
abuse, elder sexual abuse, sexual abuse and 
exploitation of disabled persons and mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community, commercial 
sex trafficking, sexual harassment, and 
stalking; 
Whereas studies have suggested that the 
rate at which American Indians and Alaska 
Natives experience sexual violence is signifi-
cantly higher than for other populations in 
the United States; 
Whereas, according to a 2010 CDC survey, 
approximately 1 in 8 lesbian women (13 per-
cent or 214,000), nearly half of all bisexual 
women (46 percent or 1,500,000), and 1 in 6 
heterosexual women (17 percent or 19,000,000) 
have been raped in their lifetime; 
Whereas, according to the National Alli-
ance to End Sexual Violence, in addition to 
the immediate physical and emotional costs, 
sexual assault has numerous adverse con-
sequences, which can include post-traumatic 
stress disorder, substance abuse, major de-
pression, homelessness, eating disorders, and 
suicide; 
Whereas, according to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, an average of only 34 
percent of rapes or sexual assaults in the 
United States were reported to law enforce-
ment agencies; 
Whereas many sexual assaults are not re-
ported to law enforcement agencies, and 
many States have restrictive criminal stat-
utes of limitations, which enable many per-
petrators to evade punishment for their 
crimes; 
Whereas advances in deoxyribonucleic acid 
(commonly known as ‘‘DNA’’) technology 
have enabled law enforcement agencies to 
identify and prosecute the perpetrators in 
tens of thousands of previously unsolved sex-
ual assault cases; 
Whereas incarceration of sexual assault 
perpetrators can prevent perpetrators from 
committing additional crimes; 
Whereas national, State, territorial, and 
Tribal coalitions, community-based rape cri-
sis centers, and other organizations across 
the United States are committed to— 
(1) eliminating sexual violence through 
prevention and education; and 
(2) increasing public awareness of sexual 
violence and the prevalence of sexual vio-
lence; 
Whereas important partnerships have been 
formed among criminal and juvenile justice 
agencies, health professionals, public health 
workers, educators, first responders, and vic-
tim service providers; 
Whereas thousands of volunteers and staff 
at rape crisis centers, State coalitions 
against sexual assault, and nonprofit organi-
zations across the United States play an im-
portant role in making crisis hotlines and 
other services available to survivors of sex-
ual assault; 
Whereas free, confidential help is available 
to all victims and survivors of sexual assault 
through— 
(1) the victim service programs of the 
Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network 
(commonly known and referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘RAINN’’), including the Na-
tional Sexual Assault Hotline— 
(A) by telephone at 800–656–HOPE; and 
(B) online at https://hotline.rainn.org; 
and 
(2) more than 1,500 sexual assault service 
providers across the United States; 
Whereas the victim service programs of 
RAINN, including the National Sexual As-
sault Hotline, helped a total of 60,437 victims 
receive help in May and June of 2020, up 18 
percent from the same time period in 2019; 
Whereas the Department of Defense pro-
vides the Safe Helpline, Safe HelpRoom, and 
Safe Helpline mobile application, each of 
which provide support and help to members 
of the Department of Defense community— 
(1) by telephone at 877–995–5247; and 
(2) online at https://SafeHelpline.org; 
Whereas individual and collective efforts 
reflect the dream of the people of the United 
States— 
(1) for individuals and organizations to ac-
tively work to prevent all forms of sexual vi-
olence; and 
(2) for no victim of sexual assault to be 
unserved or feel that there is no path to jus-
tice; and 
Whereas April 2021 is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Sexual Assault Awareness and Preven-
tion Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(A) National Sexual Assault Awareness and 
Prevention Month provides a special oppor-
tunity to— 
(i) educate the people of the United States 
about sexual violence; and 
(ii) encourage— 
(I) the prevention of sexual assault; 
(II) improvement in the treatment of sur-
vivors of sexual assault; and 
(III) the prosecution of perpetrators of sex-
ual assault; 
(B) it is appropriate to properly acknowl-
edge survivors of sexual assault and to com-
mend the volunteers and professionals who 
assist those survivors in their efforts to heal; 
(C) national and community organizations 
and private sector supporters should be rec-
ognized and applauded for their work in— 
(i) promoting awareness about sexual as-
sault; 
(ii) providing information and treatment 
to survivors of sexual assault; and 
(iii) increasing the number of successful 
prosecutions of perpetrators of sexual as-
sault; and 
(D) public safety, law enforcement, and 
health professionals should be recognized 
and applauded for their hard work and inno-
vative strategies to ensure perpetrators of 
sexual assault are held accountable; and 
(2) the Senate supports the goals and ideals 
of National Sexual Assault Awareness and 
Prevention Month.

LUJA´ N, and Mr. KING) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources: 
S. RES. 224 
Whereas the United States enjoys an abun-
dance of clean energy resources, world-class 
research facilities, cutting-edge industrial 
capabilities, and an unrivaled culture of en-
trepreneurship and technological innovation; 
Whereas, as of the date of adoption of this 
resolution, technology exists to power the 
majority of energy systems in the United 
States with zero-emission electricity; 
Whereas achieving widespread electrifica-
tion— 
(1) will reduce the overall energy needs of 
the United States economy by up to 50 per-
cent; and 
(2) can substantially decrease overall con-
sumer energy costs while maintaining the 
same or better lifestyles for individuals and 
families in the United States; 
Whereas national and subnational econo-
mies around the world, including in the 
United States, are engaged in a fundamental 
transition away from energy systems based 
on fossil fuels to zero-emission energy sys-
tems; 
Whereas the United States has the oppor-
tunity to become a clean energy superpower, 
and in the process has the opportunity— 
(1) to become a net exporter of bulk zero- 
emission electricity and of products made 
with zero-emission electricity; 
(2) to capture new and expanding power 
and technology markets; 
(3) to benefit from the ongoing global tran-
sition away from fossil fuel energy towards 
widespread electrification using zero-emis-
sion electricity; and 
(4) to become an international leader in 
the production and adoption of zero-emission 
vehicles; 
Whereas climate change caused by human 
activities, especially by greenhouse gas 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion, rep-
resents a serious, present, and growing 
threat— 
(1) to human health, security, and eco-
nomic well-being; and 
(2) to the environment; 
Whereas 
low-income 
communities 
and 
communities of color are disproportionately 
impacted by the harmful effects of climate 
change and air pollution, including being at 
a higher risk of experiencing— 
(1) severe floods, droughts, and wildfires; 
(2) economic dislocation; and 
(3) significant health problems, including 
pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, heart at-
tacks, strokes, and lung cancer; 
Whereas transitioning the energy systems 
of the United States to zero-emission elec-
tricity would— 
(1) drastically reduce net greenhouse gas 
emissions in the United States; 
(2) improve air and water quality through-
out the United States; and 
(3) improve numerous health conditions as-
sociated with the burning of fossil fuels for 
millions of individuals in the United States; 
Whereas the work required to electrify the 
economy of the United States would produce 
millions of high-paying, sustainable jobs 
that would— 
(1) be created throughout the United 
States, including in urban, rural, suburban, 
and Tribal communities; and 
(2) require directly translatable skills from 
individuals who, as of the date of adoption of 
this resolution, hold jobs in— 
(A) the fossil fuel industry; 
(B) the construction and building indus-
try; 
(C) the electricity industry, including 
residential and commercial electricians; 
and 
(D) the automotive industry; 
Whereas the average household in the 
United States spends, as of the date of adop-
tion of this resolution, approximately $4,500 
per year on energy, including $2,000 per year 
on vehicle fuel; 
Whereas, with supportive policy, house-
holds in the United States can save up to 
half of their annual energy costs by electri-
fying their household energy systems, in-
cluding through— 
(1) the installation of— 
(A) rooftop or distributed photovoltaic 
solar and home battery systems; 
(B) electric heat pumps and electric heat 
pump water heaters; and 
(C) electric household appliances; and 
(2) the purchase of electric vehicles; 
Whereas many low- and moderate-income 
families in the United States lack access to 
credit and financing options that would en-
able those families to install money-saving 
electrified household energy systems; 
Whereas reaping the benefits of electrifica-
tion could be made more accessible and cost- 
effective 
for 
individuals 
in 
the 
United 
States, so that the access and costs compare 
more favorably with other countries, by— 
(1) reducing the up-front capital outlays 
typically required; and 
(2) decreasing the cost of local permitting 
and regulations for rooftop solar and other 
distributed renewable energy generation in 
the United States; 
Whereas investments in energy efficiency 
programs can— 
(1) reduce the size and cost of electric heat-
ing systems; 
(2) help increase systemic resiliency to pe-
riods of extreme temperature; and 
(3) in addition to other investments in in-
frastructure, help improve the ability of the 
electric power grid to serve peak electric de-
mand; 
Whereas utility-scale wind and solar in-
stallations 
are 
among 
the 
lowest-cost 
sources of electricity available in the United 
States; 
Whereas 
additional 
interregional 
high- 
voltage 
direct-current 
electricity 
trans-
mission capacity— 
(1) is critical to the development of new 
clean energy generation; and 
(2) can help ensure reliable and consistent 
electricity supply; and 
Whereas supporting rapid electrification 
and innovation in all sectors of the United 
States economy while transitioning to zero- 
emission electricity production using proven 
generation technologies is one of the fastest, 
most efficient ways to reduce United States 
greenhouse gas emissions, reduce the aver-
age energy bills of people of the United 
States, and create millions of good-paying 
jobs to put individuals in the United States 
back to work in response to the COVID–19 
pandemic: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the United States must seize the oppor-
tunity to create millions of jobs, become a 
net exporter of clean energy, and secure a 
better, more equitable future by accelerating 
the electrification of households, buildings, 
and businesses in the United States, modern-
izing the United States electricity grid, and 
continuing 
on 
the 
path 
towards 
decarbonizing electricity generation in the 
United States by 2035; 
(2) the goals described in paragraph (1) are 
consistent with, and should be achieved 
through, efforts that prioritize the objectives 
of— 
(A) creating millions of good-paying jobs, 
with collective bargaining agreements, and 
advancing a thriving, equitable economy 
with an expanded middle class; 
(B) maintaining the global leadership of 
the United States in innovation; 
(C) ensuring that not less than 40 percent 
of the benefits of Federal investments in 
electrification efforts flow to historically 
marginalized communities and individuals 
disproportionately affected by the health 
and environmental impacts of fossil fuels;

SEC. 2114. HANDS-ON LEARNING PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Developing a robust, talented, and 
homegrown workforce, particularly in the

the United States innovation economy. 
(2) The United States educational system 
is not producing a sufficient number of work-
ers with the necessary STEM expertise to 
meet the needs of the United States industry 
in STEM fields. 
(3) Hands-on and experiential learning op-
portunities outside of the classroom are crit-
ical for student success in STEM subjects 
and careers, stimulating students’ interest, 
increasing confidence, and creating motiva-
tion to pursue a related career. 
(4) Hands-on and experiential learning op-
portunities can be particularly successful in 
inspiring interest in students who tradition-
ally have been underrepresented in STEM 
fields, including girls, students of color, and 
students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
(5) An expansion of hands-on and experien-
tial learning programs across the United 
States would expand the STEM workforce 
pipeline, developing and training students 
for careers in STEM fields. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.— 
(1) ESEA TERMS.—The terms ‘‘elementary 
school’’, ‘‘high school’’, ‘‘secondary school’’, 
and ‘‘State’’ have the meanings given the 
terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
7801). 
(2) 
ELIGIBLE
NONPROFIT
PROGRAM.—The 
term ‘‘eligible nonprofit program’’— 
(A) means a nonprofit program serving pre-
kindergarten, elementary school, or sec-
ondary school students; and 
(B) includes a program described in sub-
paragraph (A) that covers the continuum of 
education 
from 
prekindergarten 
through 
high school and is available in every State. 
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this section 
are to— 
(1) provide effective, compelling, and en-
gaging means for teaching and reinforcing 
fundamental STEM concepts and inspiring 
the youth of the United States to pursue ca-
reers in STEM-related fields; 
(2) expand the STEM workforce pipeline by 
developing and training students for careers 
in United States STEM fields; and 
(3) broaden participation in the STEM 
workforce by underrepresented population 
groups.

technology advancement by defining and es-
tablishing common foundations for inter-
operability, product differentiation, techno-
logical innovation, and other value-added 
services. 
(2) Standards also promote an expanded, 
more interoperable, and efficient market-
place. 
(3) Global cooperation and coordination on 
standards for emerging technologies will be 
critical for having a consistent set of ap-
proaches to enable market competition, pre-
clude barriers to trade, and allow innovation 
to flourish. 
(4) The People’s Republic of China’s Stand-
ardization Reform Plan and Five-Year Plan 
for Standardization highlight its high-level 
goals to establish China as a standards power 
by 2020, participate in at least half of all 
standards drafting and revision efforts in 
recognized international standards setting 
organizations, and strengthen China’s par-
ticipation in the governance of international 
standards setting organizations. 
(5) As emerging technologies develop for 
global deployment, it is critical that the 
United States and its allies continue to par-
ticipate in the development of standards 
that underpin the technologies themselves, 
and the future international governance of 
these technologies. 
(6) The United States position on standard-
ization in emerging technologies will be crit-
ical to United States economic competitive-
ness. 
(7) The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology is in a unique position to 
strengthen

States 
leadership 
in 
standards 
development, 
particularly 
for 
emerging technologies, to ensure continuing 
United States economic competitiveness and 
national security. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the principles of openness, trans-
parency, due process, and consensus in the 
development of international standards are 
critical; 
(2) voluntary consensus standards, devel-
oped through an industry-led process, serve 
as the cornerstone of the United States

tion. 
(2) The large and complex innovative and 
technological capabilities of global supply 
chains and manufacturing economies, which 
influence the course of national and inter-
national manufacturing and innovative rel-
evance, require appropriate attention, in-
cluding long-range inclusive planning and 
more immediate program development, to 
encourage and support private manufac-
turing growth in the United States and par-
ticipation in the public decision-making 
process.

pabilities of business in the United States, 
when properly fostered, applied, and sup-
ported, can effectively assist in improving 
the quality of life for people in the United 
States, 
in 
anticipating 
and 
addressing 
emerging international, national, and local 
problems,

strengthening 
the 
inter-
national economic engagement and pio-
neering leadership of the United States. 
(4) Just as Federal funding for science and 
technology represents an investment in the 
future, strategically addressing gaps in the 
innovation pipeline of the United States 
would— 
(A) contribute to converting research and 
development investments into high-value, 
quality job-creating product production and 
capture domestic and global markets; and 
(B) strengthen the economic posture of the 
United States. 
(5) The capabilities of the United States at 
both the Federal and State levels need en-
hanced strategic planning and influence over 
policy formulation for industrial innovation 
and technology development, as well as a 
means to ensure an adequate workforce. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—

SEC. 3002. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is 
leveraging its political, diplomatic, eco-
nomic, military, technological, and ideolog-
ical power to become a strategic, near-peer, 
global competitor of the United States. The 
policies increasingly pursued by the PRC in 
these domains are contrary to the interests 
and values of the United States, its partners, 
and much of the rest of the world. 
(2) The current policies being pursued by 
the PRC— 
(A) threaten the future character of the 
international order and are shaping the 
rules, norms, and institutions that govern 
relations among states; 
(B) will put at risk the ability of the 
United States to secure its national inter-
ests; and 
(C) will put at risk the future peace, pros-
perity, and freedom of the international 
community in the coming decades. 
(3) After normalizing diplomatic relations 
with the PRC in 1979, the United States ac-
tively worked to advance the PRC’s eco-
nomic and social development to ensure that 
the PRC participated in, and benefitted 
from, the free and open international order. 
The United States pursued these goals and 
contributed to the welfare of the Chinese 
people by— 
(A) increasing the PRC’s trade relations 
and access to global capital markets; 
(B) promoting the PRC’s accession to the 
World Trade Organization; 
(C) providing development finance and 
technical assistance; 
(D) promoting research collaboration; 
(E) educating the PRC’s top students; 
(F) permitting transfers of cutting-edge 
technologies and scientific knowledge; and 
(G) providing intelligence and military as-
sistance. 
(4) It is now clear that the PRC has chosen 
to pursue state-led, mercantilist economic 
policies, an increasingly authoritarian gov-
ernance model at home through increased re-
strictions on personal freedoms, and an ag-
gressive and assertive foreign policy. These 
policies frequently and deliberately under-
mine United States interests and are con-
trary to core United States values and the 
values of other nations, both in the Indo-Pa-
cific and beyond. In response to this stra-
tegic decision of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP), the United States has been 
compelled to reexamine and revise its strat-
egy towards the PRC. 
(5) The General Secretary of the CCP and 
the President of the PRC, Xi Jinping, has 
elevated the ‘‘Great Rejuvenation of the Chi-
nese Nation’’ as central to the domestic and 
foreign policy of the PRC. His program de-
mands— 
(A) strong, centralized CCP leadership; 
(B) concentration of military power; 
(C) a strong role for the CCP in the state 
and the economy; 
(D) an aggressive foreign policy seeking 
control over broadly asserted territorial 
claims; and 
(E) the denial of any values and individual 
rights that are deemed to threaten the CCP. 
(6) The PRC views its Leninist model of 
governance, ‘‘socialism with Chinese charac-
teristics’’, as superior to, and at odds with, 
the constitutional models of the United 
States and other democracies. This approach 
to governance is lauded by the CCP as essen-
tial to securing the PRC’s status as a global 
leader, and to shaping the future of the 
world. In a 2013 speech, President Xi said, 
‘‘We firmly believe that as socialism with 
Chinese characteristics develops further . . . 
it is . . . inevitable that the superiority of 
our socialist system will be increasingly ap-
parent . . . [and] our country’s road of devel-
opment will have increasingly greater influ-
ence on the world.’’. 
(7) The PRC’s objectives are to first estab-
lish regional hegemony over the Indo-Pacific 
and then to use that dominant position to 
propel the PRC to become the ‘‘leading world 
power,’’ shaping an international order that 
is conducive to the CCP’s interests. Achiev-
ing these objectives require turning the PRC 
into a wealthy nation under strict CCP rule 
and using a strong military and advanced 
technological capability to pursue the PRC’s 
objectives, regardless of other countries’ in-
terests. 
(8) The PRC is reshaping the current inter-
national order, which is built upon the rule 
of law and free and open ideals and prin-
ciples, by conducting global information and 
influence operations, seeking to redefine 
international laws and norms to align with 
the objectives of the CCP, rejecting the le-
gitimacy 
of 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights, and seeking to co-opt the 
leadership and agenda of multinational orga-
nizations for the benefit of the PRC and 
other authoritarian regimes at the expense 
of the interests of the United States and the 
international community. In December 2018, 
President Xi suggested that the CCP views 
its ‘‘historic mission’’ as not only to govern 
China, but also to profoundly influence glob-
al governance to benefit the CCP. 
(9) The PRC is encouraging other countries 
to follow its model of ‘‘socialism with Chi-
nese characteristics’’. During the 19th Party 
Congress in 2017, President Xi said that the 
PRC could serve as a model of development 
for other countries by utilizing ‘‘Chinese wis-
dom’’ and a ‘‘Chinese approach to solving 
problems’’. 
(10) The PRC is promoting its governance 
model and attempting to weaken other mod-
els of governance by— 
(A) undermining democratic institutions; 
(B) subverting financial institutions; 
(C) coercing businesses to accommodate 
the policies of the PRC; and 
(D) using disinformation to disguise the 
nature of the actions described in subpara-
graphs (A) through (C). 
(11) The PRC is close to its goal of becom-
ing the global leader in science and tech-
nology. In May 2018, President Xi said that 
for the PRC to reach ‘‘prosperity and reju-
venation’’, it needs to ‘‘endeavor to be a 
major world center for science and innova-
tion’’. The PRC has invested the equivalent 
of billions of dollars into education and re-
search and development, and has established 
joint scientific research centers and science 
universities. 
(12) The PRC’s drive to become a ‘‘manu-
facturing and technological superpower’’ and 
to promote ‘‘innovation with Chinese charac-
teristics’’ is coming at the expense of human 
rights and longstanding international rules 
and norms with respect to economic com-
petition, and presents a challenge to United 
States national security and the security of 
allies and like-minded countries. In par-
ticular, the PRC advances its illiberal polit-
ical and social policies through mass surveil-
lance, social credit systems, and a signifi-
cant role of the state in internet governance. 
Through these means, the PRC increases di-
rect and indirect government control over 
its citizens’ everyday lives. Its national 
strategy of ‘‘Military-Civil Fusion’’ man-
dates that civil and commercial research, 
which increasingly drives global innovation, 
is leveraged to develop new military capa-
bilities. 
(13) The PRC and the CCP are committing 
crimes against humanity and are engaged in 
an ongoing genocide, in violation of the Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris De-
cember 9, 1948, against the predominantly 
Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and reli-
gious minority groups in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur 
Autonomous 
Region, 
including 
through campaigns of imprisonment, tor-
ture, rape, and coercive birth prevention 
policies. 
(14) The PRC is using legal and illegal 
means to achieve its objective of becoming a 
manufacturing 
and 
technological 
super-
power. The PRC uses state-directed indus-
trial policies in anticompetitive ways to en-
sure the dominance of PRC companies. The 
CCP engages in and encourages actions that 
actively undermine a free and open inter-
national market, such as intellectual prop-
erty theft, forced technology transfers, regu-
latory and financial subsidies, and manda-
tory CCP access to proprietary data as part 
of business and commercial agreements be-
tween Chinese and foreign companies. 
(15) The policies referred to in paragraph 
(14) are designed to freeze United States and 
other foreign firms out of the PRC market, 
while eroding competition in other impor-
tant markets. The heavy subsidization of 
Chinese companies includes potential viola-
tion of its World Trade Organization com-
mitments. In May 2018, President Xi said 
that the PRC aims to keep the ‘‘initiatives 
of innovation and development security . . . 
in [China’s] own hands’’. 
(16) The PRC is advancing its global objec-
tives through a variety of avenues, including 
its signature initiative, the Belt and Road 
Initiative (BRI), which is enshrined in the 
Chinese Constitution and includes the Dig-
ital Silk Road and Health Silk Road. The 
PRC describes BRI as a straightforward and 
wholly beneficial plan for all countries. How-
ever, it eventually seeks to advance an eco-
nomic system with the PRC at its center, 
making it the most concrete geographical 
representation of the PRC’s global ambi-
tions. BRI increases the economic influence 
of state-owned Chinese firms in global mar-
kets, enhances the PRC’s political leverage 
with government leaders around the world, 
and provides greater access to strategic 
nodes such as ports and railways. Through 
BRI, the PRC seeks political deference 
through economic dependence. 
(17) The PRC is executing a plan to estab-
lish regional hegemony over the Indo-Pacific 
and displace the United States from the re-
gion. As a Pacific power, the United States

May 18, 2021 
has built and supported enduring alliances 
and economic partnerships that secure peace 
and prosperity and promote the rule of law 
and political pluralism in a free and open 
Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the PRC uses eco-
nomic and military coercion in the region to 
secure its own interests. 
(18) The PRC’s military strategy seeks to 
keep the United States military from oper-
ating in the Western Pacific and to erode 
United States security guarantees. 
(19) The PRC is aggressively pursuing ex-
clusive control of critical land routes, sea 
lanes, and air space in the Indo-Pacific in the 
hopes of eventually exercising greater influ-
ence beyond the region. This includes lanes 
crucial to commercial activity, energy ex-
ploration, transport, and the exercise of se-
curity operations in areas permitted under 
international law. 
(20) The PRC seeks so-called ‘‘reunifica-
tion’’ with Taiwan through whatever means 
may ultimately be required. The CCP’s in-
sistence that so-called ‘‘reunification’’ is 
Taiwan’s only option makes this goal inher-
ently coercive. In January 2019, President Xi 
stated that the PRC ‘‘make[s] no promise to 
renounce the use of force and reserve[s] the 
option of taking all necessary means’’. Tai-
wan’s embodiment of democratic values and 
economic liberalism challenges President 
Xi’s goal of achieving national rejuvenation. 
The PRC plans to exploit Taiwan’s dominant 
strategic position in the First Island Chain 
and to project power into the Second Island 
Chain and beyond. 
(21) In the South China Sea, the PRC has 
executed an illegal island-building campaign 
that threatens freedom of navigation and the 
free-flow of commerce, damages the environ-
ment, bolsters PLA power projection capa-
bilities, and coerces and intimidates other 
regional claimants in an effort to advance its 
unlawful claims and control the waters 
around neighboring countries. Despite Presi-
dent Xi’s September 2015 speech, in which he 
said the PRC did not intend to militarize the 
South China Sea, during the 2017 19th Party 
Congress, President Xi announced that ‘‘con-
struction on islands and reefs in the South 
China Sea have seen steady progress’’. 
(22) The PRC is rapidly modernizing the 
PLA to attain a level of capacity and capa-
bility superior to the United States in terms 
of equipment and conduct of modern mili-
tary operations by shifting its military doc-
trine from having a force ‘‘adequate [for] 
China’s defensive needs’’ to having a force 
‘‘commensurate with China’s international 
status’’. Ultimately, this transformation 
could enable China to impose its will in the 
Indo-Pacific region through the threat of 
military force. In 2017, President Xi estab-
lished the following developmental bench-
marks for the advancement of the PLA: 
(A) A mechanized force with increased 
informatized and strategic capabilities by 
2020. 
(B) The complete modernization of China’s 
national defense by 2035. 
(C) The full transformation of the PLA 
into a world-class force by 2050. 
(23) The PRC’s strategy and supporting 
policies described in this section undermine 
United States interests, such as— 
(A) upholding a free and open international 
order; 
(B) maintaining the integrity of inter-
national institutions with liberal norms and 
values; 
(C) preserving a favorable balance of power 
in the Indo-Pacific; 
(D) ensuring the defense of its allies; 
(E) preserving open sea and air lanes; 
(F) fostering the free flow of commerce 
through open and transparent markets; and 
(G) promoting individual freedom and 
human rights. 
(24) The global COVID–19 pandemic has in-
tensified and accelerated these trends in the 
PRC’s behavior and therefore increased the 
need for United States global leadership and 
a competitive posture. The PRC has capital-
ized on the world’s focus on the COVID–19 
pandemic by— 
(A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong 
Kong’s autonomy, including imposing a so- 
called ‘‘national security law’’ on Hong 
Kong; 
(B) aggressively imposing its will in the 
East and South China Seas; 
(C) contributing to increased tensions with 
India; and 
(D) engaging in a widespread and govern-
ment-directed disinformation campaign to 
obscure the PRC government’s efforts to 
cover up the seriousness of COVID–19, sow 
confusion about the origination of the out-
break, and discredit the United States, its 
allies, and global health efforts. 
(25) The CCP’s disinformation campaign re-
ferred to in paragraph (24)(D) has included— 
(A) concerted efforts, in the early days of 
the pandemic, to downplay the nature and 
scope of the outbreak in Wuhan in the PRC, 
as well as cases of person-to-person trans-
mission; 
(B) claims that the virus originated in 
United States biological defense research at 
Fort Detrick, Maryland; 
(C) Chinese state media reports insinuating 
a possible link between the virus and other 
United States biological facilities; and 
(D) efforts to block access to qualified 
international infectious disease experts who 
might contradict the CCP’s narrative. 
(26) In response to the PRC’s strategy and 
policies, the United States must adopt a pol-
icy of strategic competition with the PRC to 
protect and promote our vital interests and 
values. 
(27) The United States’ policy of strategic 
competition with respect to the PRC is part 
of a broader strategic approach to the Indo- 
Pacific and the world which centers around 
cooperation with United States allies and 
partners to advance shared values and inter-
ests and to preserve and enhance a free, 
open, democratic, inclusive, rules-based, sta-
ble, and diverse region. 
(28) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–409) contributed to a 
comprehensive framework for promoting 
United State security interests, economic in-
terests, and values in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, investing $7,500,000,000 over 5 years— 
(A) to support greater security and defense 
cooperation between the United States and 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion; 
(B) to advance democracy and the protec-
tion and promotion of human rights in the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(C) to enhance cybersecurity cooperation 
between the United States and partners in 
the Indo-Pacific; 
(D) to deepen people-to-people engagement 
through programs such as the Young South-
east 
Asian 
Leaders 
Initiative 
and 
the 
ASEAN Youth Volunteers program; and 
(E) to enhance energy cooperation and en-
ergy security in the Indo-Pacific region.

SEC. 3004. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
(a) OBJECTIVES.—It is the policy of the 
United States, in pursuing strategic com-
petition with the PRC, to pursue the fol-
lowing objectives: 
(1) The United States global leadership role 
is sustained and its political system and 
major foundations of national power are pos-
tured for long-term political, economic, 
technological, 
and 
military 
competition 
with the PRC. 
(2) The balance of power in the Indo-Pa-
cific remains favorable to the United States 
and its allies. The United States and its al-
lies maintain unfettered access to the re-
gion, including through freedom of naviga-
tion and the free flow of commerce, con-
sistent with international law and practice, 
and the PRC neither dominates the region 
nor coerces its neighbors. 
(3) The allies and partners of the United 
States— 
(A) maintain confidence in United States 
leadership and its commitment to the Indo- 
Pacific region; 
(B) can withstand and combat subversion 
and undue influence by the PRC; and 
(C) align themselves with the United 
States in setting global rules, norms, and 
standards that benefit the international 
community. 
(4) The combined weight of the United 
States and its allies and partners is strong 
enough to demonstrate to the PRC that the 
risks of attempts to dominate other states 
outweigh the potential benefits. 
(5) The United States leads the free and 
open international order, which is comprised 
of resilient states and institutions that up-
hold and defend principles, such as sov-
ereignty, rule of law, individual freedom, and 
human rights. The international order is 
strengthened to defeat attempts at desta-
bilization by illiberal and authoritarian ac-
tors. 
(6) The key rules, norms, and standards of 
international engagement in the 21st cen-
tury are maintained, including— 
(A) the protection of human rights, com-
mercial engagement and investment, and 
technology; and 
(B) that such rules, norms, and standards 
are in alignment with the values and inter-
ests of the United States, its allies and part-
ners, and the free world. 
(7) The United States assures that the CCP 
does not— 
(A) subvert open and democratic societies; 
(B) distort global markets; 
(C) manipulate the international trade sys-
tem; 
(D) coerce other nations via economic and 
military means; or 
(E) use its technological advantages to un-
dermine individual freedoms or other states’ 
national security interests.

SEC. 3005. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the execu-
tion of the policy described in section 3004(b) 
requires the following actions: 
(1) Strategic competition with the PRC 
will require the United States— 
(A) to marshal sustained political will to 
protect its vital interests, promote its val-
ues, and advance its economic and national 
security objectives for decades to come; and 
(B) to achieve this sustained political will, 
persuade the American people and United 
States allies and partners of— 
(i) the challenges posed by the PRC; and 
(ii) the need for long-term competition to 
defend shared interests and values. 
(2) The United States must coordinate 
closely with allies and partners to compete 
effectively with the PRC, including to en-
courage allies and partners to assume, as ap-
propriate, greater roles in balancing and 
checking the aggressive and assertive behav-
ior of the PRC. 
(3) The President of the United States 
must lead and direct the entire executive 
branch to treat the People’s Republic of 
China as the greatest geopolitical and 
geoeconomic challenge for United States for-
eign policy, increasing the prioritization of 
strategic competition with the PRC and 
broader United States interests in the Indo- 
Pacific region in the conduct of foreign pol-
icy and assuring the allocation of appro-
priate resources adequate to the challenge. 
(4) The head of every Federal department 
and agency should designate a senior official 
at the level of Under Secretary or above to 
coordinate the department’s or agency’s 
policies with respect to strategic competi-
tion with the PRC. 
(5) The ability of the United States to exe-
cute a strategy of strategic competition with 
the PRC will be undermined if our attention 
is repeatedly diverted to challenges that are 
not vital to United States economic and na-
tional security interests. 
(6) In the coming decades, the United 
States must prevent the PRC from— 
(A) establishing regional hegemony in the 
Indo-Pacific; and

resource all instruments of United States na-
tional power; and

are used.

lenge posed by the PRC requires— 
(A) bipartisan cooperation within Con-
gress; and

collaboration and consultation between the 
executive branch and Congress. 
(9) The United States must ensure close in-
tegration among economic and foreign pol-
icymakers, the private sector, civil society, 
universities and academic institutions, and 
other relevant actors in free and open soci-
eties affected by the challenges posed by the 
PRC to enable such actors— 
(A) to collaborate to advance common in-
terests; and 
(B) to identify appropriate policies— 
(i) to strengthen the United States and its 
allies; 
(ii) to promote a compelling vision of a 
free and open order; and 
(iii) to push back against detrimental poli-
cies pursued by the CCP.

nized to reflect the fact that strategic com-
petition with the PRC is the United States’ 
greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic chal-
lenge, including through the assigned mis-
sions and location of United States Govern-
ment personnel, by— 
(A) dedicating more personnel in the Indo- 
Pacific region, at posts around the world, 
and in Washington DC, with priorities di-
rectly relevant to advancing competition 
with the People’s Republic of China; 
(B) placing greater numbers of foreign 
service officers, international development 
professionals, members of the foreign com-
mercial service, intelligence professionals,

vilian and military, has the training in lan-
guage, technical skills, and other com-
petencies required to advance a successful 
competitive strategy with the PRC. 
(11) The United States must place renewed 
emphasis on strengthening the nonmilitary 
instruments of national power, including di-
plomacy, information, technology, econom-
ics, foreign assistance and development fi-
nance, commerce, intelligence, and law en-
forcement, which are crucial for addressing 
the unique economic, political, and ideolog-
ical challenges posed by the PRC. 
(12) 
The 
United 
States

tive, which shall be aligned with the over-
arching political and diplomatic objectives 
articulated in the Asia Reassurance Initia-
tive Act (Public Law 115–409), and must 
prioritize the military investments nec-
essary to achieve United States political ob-
jectives in the Indo-Pacific, including— 
(A) promoting regional security in the 
Indo-Pacific; 
(B) reassuring allies and partners while

the United States;

(2) total or partial ownership or acquisi-
tion of, or a significant financial stake or 
physical presence in, certain types of infra-
structure, including ports, energy grids, 5G 
telecommunications networks, and undersea 
cables, can provide an advantage to coun-

(3) the United States must continue to 
prioritize support for infrastructure projects 
that are physically secure, financially via-
ble, economically sustainable, and socially

(5) the GICC represents an important and 
concrete step towards better communication 
and coordination across the United States 
Government of economic tools relevant to 
supporting infrastructure that is physically 
secure, financially viable, economically sus-
tainable, and socially responsible, and should 
be continued; and

DIGITAL 
AUTHORITARIANISM.—It is the sense of Con-
gress that the United States, along with al-
lies and partners, should lead an inter-
national effort that utilizes all of the eco-
nomic and diplomatic tools at its disposal to

SEC. 3133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION 
WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
OPERATIONS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In the report to Congress required under 
section 1261(b) of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), the President 
laid out a broad range of malign activities 
conducted by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and its agents and enti-
ties, including— 
(A) propaganda and disinformation, in 
which ‘‘Beijing communicates its narrative 
through state-run television, print, radio, 
and online organizations whose presence is 
proliferating in the United States and 
around the world’’; 
(B) malign political influence operations, 
particularly ‘‘front organizations and agents 
which target businesses, universities, think 
tanks, scholars, journalists, and local state 
and Federal officials in the United States 
and around the world, attempting to influ-
ence discourse’’; and 
(C) malign financial influence operations, 
characterized as the ‘‘misappropriation of 
technology and intellectual property, failure 
to appropriately disclose relationships with 
foreign 
government 
sponsored 
entities, 
breaches of contract and confidentiality, and 
manipulation of processes for fair and merit- 
based allocation of Federal research and de-
velopment funding’’. 
(2) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are ongoing. In 
January 2019, then-Director of National In-
telligence, Dan Coats, stated, ‘‘China will 
continue to use legal, political, and eco-
nomic levers—such as the lure of Chinese 
markets—to shape the information environ-
ment. It is also capable of using cyber at-
tacks against systems in the United States 
to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems po-
litically sensitive.’’. 
(3) In February 2020, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of the House of Representatives that 
the People’s Republic of China has ‘‘very ac-
tive [malign] foreign influence efforts in this 
country,’’ with the goal of ‘‘trying to shift 
our policy and our public opinion to be more 
pro-China on a variety of issues’’. 
(4) The PRC’s information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations continue to adopt 
new tactics and evolve in sophistication. In 
May 2020, then-Special Envoy and Coordi-
nator of the Global Engagement Center 
(GEC), Lea Gabrielle, stated that there was a 
convergence of Russian and Chinese nar-
ratives surrounding COVID–19 and that the 
GEC had ‘‘uncovered a new network of 
inauthentic Twitter accounts’’ that it as-
sessed was ‘‘created with the intent to am-
plify 
Chinese 
propaganda 
and 
disinformation’’. In June 2020, Google re-
ported that Chinese hackers attempted to 
access email accounts of the campaign staff 
of a presidential candidate. 
(5) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are a threat to the 
national security, democracy, and economic 
systems of the United States and its allies 
and partners. In October 2018, Vice President 
Michael R. Pence warned that ‘‘Beijing is 
employing a whole-of-government approach, 
using political, economic, and military tools, 
as well as propaganda, to advance its influ-
ence and benefit its interests in the United 
States.’’. 
(6) In February 2018, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the Senate that the People’s 
Republic of China is taking advantage of and 
exploiting the open research and develop-
ment environments of United States institu-
tions of higher education to utilize ‘‘profes-
sors, scientists and students’’ as ‘‘nontradi-
tional collectors’’ of information. 
(b) PRESIDENTIAL DUTIES.—The President 
shall— 
(1) protect our democratic institutions and 
processes from malign influence from the 
People’s Republic of China and other foreign 
adversaries; and 
(2) consistent with the policy specified in 
paragraph (1), direct the heads of the appro-
priate Federal departments and agencies to 
implement Acts of Congress to counter and 
deter PRC and other foreign information 
warfare and malign influence operations 
without delay, including— 
(A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), which author-
izes a coordinator position within the Na-
tional Security Council for countering ma-
lign foreign influence operations and cam-
paigns; 
(B) section 228 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92), which authorizes additional re-
search of foreign malign influence operations 
on social media platforms; 
(C) section 847 of such Act, which requires 
the Secretary of Defense to modify con-
tracting regulations regarding vetting for 
foreign ownership, control and influence in 
order to mitigate risks from malign foreign 
influence; 
(D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires 
an update of the comprehensive strategy to 
counter the threat of malign influence to in-
clude the People’s Republic of China; 
(E) section 5323 of such Act, which author-
izes the Director of National Intelligence to 
facilitate the establishment of Social Media 
Data and Threat Analysis Center to detect 
and study information warfare and malign 
influence operations across social media 
platforms; and 
(F) section 119C of the National Security 
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes 
the establishment of a Foreign Malign Influ-
ence Response Center inside the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence. 
SEC. 3134. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS 
FOR 
THE 
FULBRIGHT-HAYS 
PRO-
GRAM. 
There are authorized to be appropriated, 
for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 
2021, 
$105,500,000, 
to 
promote 
education, 
training, research, and foreign language 
skills through the Fulbright-Hays Program, 
in accordance with section 102(b) of the Mu-
tual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act 
of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2452(b)). 
SEC. 3135. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING 
ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND DISCRIMI-
NATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, crimes and discrimination against 
Asians and those of Asian descent have risen 
dramatically worldwide. In May 2020, United 
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 
said ‘‘the pandemic continues to unleash a 
tsunami 
of 
hate 
and 
xenophobia, 
scapegoating 
and 
scare-mongering’’ 
and 
urged governments to ‘‘act now to strength-
en the immunity of our societies against the 
virus of hate’’. 
(2) Asian American and Pacific Island 
(AAPI) workers make up a large portion of 
the essential workers on the frontlines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, making up 8.5 percent 
of all essential healthcare workers in the 
United States. AAPI workers also make up a 
large share—between 6 percent and 12 per-
cent based on sector—of the biomedical field. 
(3) The United States Census notes that 
Americans of Asian descent alone made up 
nearly 5.9 percent of the United States popu-
lation in 2019, and that Asian Americans are 
the fastest-growing racial group in the 
United States, projected to represent 14 per-
cent of the United States population by 2065. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the reprehensible attacks on people of 
Asian descent and concerning increase in 
anti-Asian sentiment and racism in the 
United States and around the world have no 
place in a peaceful, civilized, and tolerant 
world; 
(2) the United States is a diverse nation 
with a proud tradition of immigration, and 
the strength and vibrancy of the United 
States is enhanced by the diverse ethnic 
backgrounds and tolerance of its citizens, in-
cluding Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers; 
(3) the United States Government should 
encourage other foreign governments to use 
the official and scientific names for the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as recommended by the 
World Health Organization and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention; and 
(4) the United States Government and 
other governments around the world must 
actively oppose racism and intolerance, and 
use all available and appropriate tools to 
combat the spread of anti-Asian racism and 
discrimination.

public diplomacy including influence cam-
paigns, advertising, and investments into 
state-sponsored media publications outside 
of the PRC. These include, for example, more 
than $10,000,000,000 in foreign direct invest-
ment 
in 
communications 
infrastructure, 
platforms, and properties, as well as bringing 
journalists to the PRC for training pro-
grams. 
(2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, 
the United Front Work Department (UFWD), 
and UFWD’s many affiliates and proxies, has 
obtained unfettered access to radio, tele-
vision, and digital dissemination platforms 
in numerous languages targeted at citizens 
in other regions where the PRC has an inter-
est in promoting public sentiment in support 
of the Chinese Communist Party and expand-
ing the reach of its misleading narratives 
and propaganda. 
(3) Even in Western democracies, the PRC 
spends extensively on influence operations, 
such as a $500,000,000 advertising campaign to 
attract cable viewers in Australia and a 
more than $20,000,000 campaign to influence 
United States public opinion via the China 
Daily newspaper supplement. 
(4) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this sub-
section as ‘‘RFA’’), a private nonprofit 
multimedia news corporation, which broad-
casts in 9 East Asian languages including 
Mandarin, Uyghur, Cantonese, and Tibetan, 
has succeeded in its mission to reach audi-
ences in China and in the Central Asia region 
despite the Chinese Government’s— 
(A) 
efforts 
to 
practice 
‘‘media 
sov-
ereignty,’’ which restricts access to the free 
press within China; and 
(B) campaign to spread disinformation to 
countries abroad. 
(5) In 2019, RFA’s Uyghur Service alerted 
the world to the human rights abuses of 
Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in Chi-
na’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
(6) Gulchehra Hoja, a Uyghur journalist for 
RFA, received the International Women’s 
Media Foundation’s Courage in Journalism 
Award and a 2019 Magnitsky Human Rights 
Award for her coverage of Xinjiang, while 
the Chinese Government detained and har-
assed Ms. Hoja’s China-based family and the 
families of 7 other RFA journalists in retal-
iation for their role in exposing abuses. 
(7) In 2019 and 2020, RFA provided widely 
disseminated print and digital coverage of 
the decline in freedom in Hong Kong and the 
student-led protests of the extradition law. 
(8) In March 2020, RFA exposed efforts by 
the Chinese Government to underreport the 
number 
of 
fatalities 
from 
the 
novel 
coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan Province, 
China. 
(b) THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR GLOB-

TITLE II—INVESTING IN ALLIANCES AND 
PARTNERSHIPS 
Subtitle A—Strategic and Diplomatic Matters 
SEC. 3201. APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CON-
GRESS DEFINED. 
In this subtitle, the term ‘‘appropriate 
committees of Congress’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3202. UNITED STATES COMMITMENT AND 
SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND PART-
NERS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States treaty alliances in 
the Indo-Pacific provide a unique strategic 
advantage to the United States and are 
among the Nation’s most precious assets, en-
abling the United States to advance its vital 
national interests, defend its territory, ex-
pand its economy through international 
trade and commerce, establish enduring co-
operation among like-minded countries, pre-
vent the domination of the Indo-Pacific and 
its surrounding maritime and air lanes by a 
hostile power or powers, and deter potential 
aggressors; 
(2) the Governments of the United States, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand are critical allies 
in advancing a free and open order in the 
Indo-Pacific region and tackling challenges 
with unity of purpose, and have collaborated 
to advance specific efforts of shared interest 
in areas such as defense and security, eco-
nomic 
prosperity, 
infrastructure 
connectivity, and fundamental freedoms; 
(3) the United States greatly values other 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding with India, Singapore, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam as well 
as regional architecture such as the Quad, 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Community (APEC), which are essential to 
further shared interests; 
(4) the security environment in the Indo- 
Pacific demands consistent United States 
and allied commitment to strengthening and 
advancing our alliances so that they are pos-
tured to meet these challenges, and will re-
quire sustained political will, concrete part-
nerships, economic, commercial, and techno-
logical cooperation, consistent and tangible 
commitments, high-level and extensive con-
sultations on matters of mutual interest, 
mutual and shared cooperation in the acqui-
sition of key capabilities important to allied 
defenses, and unified mutual support in the 
face of political, economic, or military coer-
cion; 
(5) fissures in the United States alliance 
relationships 
and 
partnerships 
benefit 
United States adversaries and weaken collec-
tive ability to advance shared interests; 
(6) the United States must work with allies 
to prioritize human rights throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(7) as the report released in August 2020 by 
the Expert Group of the International Mili-
tary 
Council 
on 
Climate 
and 
Security 
(IMCCS), titled ‘‘Climate and Security in the 
Indo-Asia Pacific’’ noted, the Indo-Pacific 
region is one of the regions most vulnerable 
to climate impacts and as former Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Installations 
and Environment Sherri Goodman, Sec-
retary General of IMCCS, noted, climate 
shocks act as a threat multiplier in the Indo- 
Pacific region, increasing humanitarian re-
sponse 
costs 
and 
impacting 
security 
throughout the region as sea levels rise, fish-
ing patterns shift, food insecurity rises, and 
storms grow stronger and more frequent; 
(8) the United State should continue to en-
gage on and deepen cooperation with allies 
and partners of the United States in the 
Indo-Pacific region, as laid out in the Asia 
Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115– 
409), in the areas of— 
(A) forecasting environmental challenges; 
(B) assisting with transnational coopera-
tion on sustainable uses of forest and water 
resources with the goal of preserving bio-
diversity and access to safe drinking water; 
(C) fisheries and marine resource conserva-
tion; and 
(D) meeting environmental challenges and 
developing resilience; and 
(9) the Secretary of State, in coordination 
with the Secretary of Defense and the Ad-
ministrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development, should facilitate 
a robust interagency Indo-Pacific climate re-
siliency and adaptation strategy focusing on 
internal and external actions needed— 
(A) to facilitate regional early recovery, 
risk reduction, and resilience to weather-re-
lated impacts on strategic interests of the 
United States and partners and allies of the 
United States in the region; and 
(B) to address humanitarian and food secu-
rity impacts of weather-related changes in 
the region. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to deepen diplomatic, economic, and se-
curity cooperation between and among the 
United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, in-
cluding through diplomatic engagement, re-
gional development, energy security and de-
velopment, scientific and health partner-
ships, educational and cultural exchanges, 
missile defense, intelligence-sharing, space, 
cyber, and other diplomatic and defense-re-
lated initiatives; 
(2) to uphold our multilateral and bilateral 
treaty obligations, including— 
(A) defending Japan, including all areas 
under the administration of Japan, under ar-
ticle V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation 
and Security Between the United States of 
America and Japan; 
(B) defending the Republic of Korea under 
article III of the Mutual Defense Treaty Be-
tween the United States and the Republic of 
Korea; 
(C) defending the Philippines under article 
IV of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between 
the United States and the Republic of the 
Philippines; 
(D) defending Thailand under the 1954 Ma-
nila Pact and the Thanat-Rusk communique 
of 1962; and 
(E) defending Australia under article IV of 
the Australia, New Zealand, United States 
Security Treaty; 
(3) to strengthen and deepen the United 
States’ bilateral and regional partnerships, 
including with India, Taiwan, ASEAN, and 
New Zealand; 
(4) to cooperate with Japan, the Republic 
of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and 
Thailand to promote human rights bilat-
erally and through regional and multilateral 
fora and pacts; and 
(5) to strengthen and advance diplomatic, 
economic, and security cooperation with re-
gional partners, such as Taiwan, Vietnam, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and India. 
SEC. 3203. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COOPERA-
TION WITH THE QUAD. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States should reaffirm our 
commitment to quadrilateral cooperation 
among Australia, India, Japan, and the 
United States (the ‘‘Quad’’) to enhance and 
implement a shared vision to meet shared re-
gional challenges and to promote a free, 
open, inclusive, resilient, and healthy Indo- 
Pacific that is characterized by democracy, 
rule of law, and market-driven economic 
growth, and is free from undue influence and 
coercion; 
(2) the United States should seek to expand 
sustained dialogue and cooperation through 
the Quad with a range of partners to support 
the rule of law, freedom of navigation and 
overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, 
democratic values, and territorial integrity, 
and to uphold peace and prosperity and 
strengthen democratic resilience; 
(3) the United States should seek to expand 
avenues of cooperation with the Quad, in-
cluding more regular military-to-military 
dialogues, joint exercises, and coordinated 
policies related to shared interests such as 
protecting cyberspace and advancing mari-
time security;

Quad leaders meeting on March 12, 2021, to

STATES
EDU-
CATIONAL
AND
EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS
WITH 
TAIWAN.— 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES- 
TAIWAN
CULTURAL
EXCHANGE
FOUNDATION.— 
The Secretary of State should consider es-
tablishing an independent nonprofit that— 
(A) is dedicated to deepening ties between 
the future leaders of Taiwan and the United 
States; and

tricts and educational institutions to send

SEC. 3214. TAIWAN FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Fellowship Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 
96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United 
States policy ‘‘to preserve and promote ex-
tensive, close, and friendly commercial, cul-
tural, and other relations between the people 
of the United States and the people on Tai-
wan, as well as the people on the China 
mainland and all other peoples of the West-
ern Pacific area’’. 
(2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance 
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), 
the United States has grown its strategic 
partnership with Taiwan’s vibrant democ-
racy of 23,000,000 people. 
(3) Despite a concerted campaign by the 
People’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan 
from its diplomatic partners and from inter-
national organizations, including the World 
Health Organization, Taiwan has emerged as 
a global leader in the coronavirus global 
pandemic response, including by donating 
more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and other 
medical equipment to the United States. 
(4) The creation of a United States fellow-
ship program with Taiwan would support— 
(A) a key priority of expanding people-to- 
people exchanges, which was outlined in 
President Donald J. Trump’s 2017 National 
Security Strategy; 
(B) President Joseph R. Biden’s commit-
ment to Taiwan, ‘‘a leading democracy and a 
critical economic and security partner,’’ as 
expressed in his March 2021 Interim National 
Security Strategic Guidance; and 
(C) April 2021 guidance from the Depart-
ment of State based on a review required 
under the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (sub-
title B of title III of division FF of Public 
Law 116–260) to ‘‘encourage U.S. government 
engagement with Taiwan that reflects our

rector-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros

termining how this pandemic emerged.

cies, and executive offices of the most likely 
source or origin of the SARS–CoV–2 virus,

States Government has taken to identify and 
investigate the source of the SARS–CoV–2

operate with, impede, or obstruct any in-
quiry or investigation to determine the

ting human rights abuses;

cil actions aimed at censuring governments 
credibly accused of committing or permit-
ting the commission of human rights viola-

Subtitle B—International Security Matters 
SEC. 3221. DEFINITIONS. 
In this subtitle: 
(1) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES
OF
CON-
GRESS.—The term ‘‘appropriate committees 
of Congress’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the Committee on Armed Services, and the 
Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; 
and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the 
Committee on Armed Services, and the Com-
mittee on Appropriations of the House of

(A) includes national security forces that

SEC. 3222. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China aims to 
use its growing military might in concert 
with other instruments of its national power 
to displace the United States in the Indo-Pa-
cific and establish hegemony over the re-
gion. 
(2) The military balance of power in the 
Indo-Pacific region is growing increasingly 
unfavorable to the United States because— 
(A) the PRC is rapidly modernizing and ex-
panding the capabilities of the PLA to 
project power and create contested areas 
across the entire Indo-Pacific region; 
(B) PLA modernization has largely focused 
on areas where it possesses operational ad-
vantages and can exploit weaknesses in the 
United States suite of capabilities; and 
(C) current United States force structure 
and presence do not sufficiently counter 
threats in the Indo-Pacific, as United States 
allies, bases, and forces at sea in the Indo- 
Pacific region are concentrated in large 
bases that are highly vulnerable to the 
PRC’s strike capabilities. 
(3) This shift in the regional military bal-
ance and erosion of conventional and stra-
tegic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region— 
(A) presents a substantial and imminent 
risk to the security of the United States; and 
(B) left unchecked, could— 
(i) embolden the PRC to take actions, in-
cluding the use of military force, to change 
the status quo before the United States can 
mount an effective response; and 
(ii) alter the nuclear balance in the Indo- 
Pacific. 
(4) The PRC sees an opportunity to dimin-
ish confidence among United States allies 
and partners in the strength of United States 
commitments, even to the extent that these 
nations feel compelled to bandwagon with 
the PRC to protect their interests. The PRC 
is closely monitoring the United States reac-
tion to PRC pressure and coercion of United 
States allies, searching for indicators of 
United States resolve. 
(5) Achieving so-called ‘‘reunification’’ of 
Taiwan to mainland China is a key step for 
the PRC to achieve its regional hegemonic 
ambitions. The PRC has increased the fre-
quency and scope of its exercises and oper-
ations targeting Taiwan, such as amphibious 
assault and live-fire exercises in the Taiwan 
Strait, PLA Air Force flights that encircle 
Taiwan, and flights across the unofficial me-
dian line in the Taiwan Strait. The Govern-
ment of the PRC’s full submission of Hong 
Kong potentially accelerates the timeline of 
a Taiwan scenario, and makes the defense of 
Taiwan an even more urgent priority. 
(6) The defense of Taiwan is critical to— 
(A) defending the people of Taiwan; 
(B) limiting the PLA’s ability to project 
power beyond the First Island Chain, includ-
ing to United States territory, such as Guam 
and Hawaii; 
(C) defending the territorial integrity of 
Japan; 
(D) preventing the PLA from diverting 
military planning, resources, and personnel 
to broader military ambitions; and 
(E) retaining the United States credibility 
as a defender of the democratic values and 
free-market principles embodied by Taiwan’s 
people and government; 
(7) The PRC capitalized on the world’s at-
tention to COVID–19 to advance its military 
objectives in the South China Sea, inten-
sifying and accelerating trends already un-
derway. The PRC has sent militarized survey 
vessels into the Malaysian Exclusive Eco-
nomic Zone, announced the establishment of 
an administrative district in the Spratly and 
Paracel Islands under the Chinese local gov-
ernment of Sansha, aimed a fire control 
radar at a Philippine navy ship, encroached 
on Indonesia’s fishing grounds, sunk a Viet-
namese fishing boat, announced new ‘‘re-
search stations’’ on Fiery Cross Reef and 
Subi Reef, landed special military aircraft 
on Fiery Cross Reef to routinize such deploy-
ments, and sent a flotilla of over 200 militia 
vessels to Whitsun Reef, a feature within the 
exclusive economic zone of the Philippines. 
(8) On July 13, 2020, the Department of 
State clarified United States policy on the 
South China Sea and stated that ‘‘Beijing’s 
claims to offshore resources across most of 
the South China Sea are completely unlaw-
ful’’. 
(9) These actions in the South China Sea 
enable the PLA to exert influence and 
project power deeper into Oceania and the 
Indian Ocean. As Admiral Phil Davidson, 
Commander of Indo-Pacific Command, testi-
fied in 2019, ‘‘In short, China is now capable 
of controlling the South China Sea in all sce-
narios short of war with the United States.’’. 
(10) The PLA also continues to advance its 
claims in the East China Sea, including 
through a high number of surface combatant 
patrols and frequent entry into the terri-
torial waters of the Senkaku Islands, over 
which the United States recognizes Japan’s 
administrative control. In April 2014, Presi-
dent Barack Obama stated, ‘‘Our commit-
ment to Japan’s security is absolute and ar-
ticle five of the U.S.-Japan security treaty 
covers all territory under Japan’s adminis-
tration, including the Senkaku islands.’’. 
(11) On March 1, 2019, Secretary of State 
Michael R. Pompeo stated, ‘‘As the South 
China Sea is part of the Pacific, any armed 
attack on Philippine forces, aircraft, or pub-
lic vessels in the South China Sea will trig-
ger mutual defense obligations under Article 
4 of our Mutual Defense Treaty.’’. 
(12) The PLA also continues to advance its 
influence over the Korean Peninsula, includ-
ing through a series of joint air exercises 
with the Russian Federation in the Republic 
of Korea’s Air Defense Identification Zone. 
(13) The PLA is modernizing and gaining 
critical capability in every branch and every 
domain, including— 
(A) positioning the PLA Navy to become a 
great maritime power or ‘‘blue-water’’ navy 
that can completely control all activity 
within the First Island Chain and project 
power beyond it with a fleet of 425 battle 
force ships by 2030; 
(B) increasing the size and range of its 
strike capabilities, including approximately 
1,900 
ground-launched 
short- 
and 
inter-
mediate-range missiles capable of targeting 
United States allies and partners in the First 
and Second Island chains, United States 
bases in the Indo-Pacific, and United States 
forces at sea; 
(C) boosting capabilities for air warfare, 
including with Russian-origin Su–35 fighters 
and S–400 air defense systems, new J–20 5th 
generation stealth fighters, advanced H–6 
bomber variants, a long-range stealth bomb-
er, and Y–20 heavy lift aircraft; 
(D) making critical investments in new do-
mains of warfare, such as cyber warfare, 
electronic warfare, and space warfare; and 
(E) increasing the size of its nuclear stock-
pile and delivery systems. 
(14) The PRC is pursuing this moderniza-
tion through all means at its disposal, in-
cluding its Military-Civil Fusion initiative, 
which enlists the whole of PRC society in de-
veloping and acquiring technology with mili-
tary applications to pursue technological ad-
vantage over the United States in artificial 
intelligence, hypersonic glide vehicles, di-
rected 
energy 
weapons, 
electromagnetic 
railguns, counter-space weapons, and other 
emerging capabilities. 
(15) The United States lead in the develop-
ment of science and technology relevant to 
defense is eroding in the face of competition 
from the PRC. United States research and 
development spending on defense capabilities 
has declined sharply as a share of global re-
search and development. The commercial 
sector’s leading role in innovation presents 
certain unique challenges to the Department 
of Defense’s reliance on technology for bat-
tlefield advantage. 
(16) The PRC has vastly increased domestic 
research and development expenditures, sup-
ported the growth of new cutting-edge indus-
tries and tapped into a large workforce to in-
vest in fostering science and engineering tal-
ent. 
(17) The PRC is increasing exports of de-
fense and security capabilities to build its 
defense technology and industrial base and 
improve its own military capabilities, as 
well as its influence with countries that pur-
chase and become dependent on its military 
systems. 
SEC. 3223. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
BOLSTERING SECURITY PARTNER-
SHIPS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
It is the sense of Congress that steps to 
bolster United States security partnerships 
in the Indo-Pacific must include— 
(1) supporting Japan in its development of 
long-range precision fires, munitions, air and 
missile defense capacity, interoperability 
across all domains, maritime security, and 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais-
sance capabilities; 
(2) launching a United States-Japan na-
tional security innovation fund to solicit and 
support private sector cooperation for new

between Japan and Australia, including sup-
porting reciprocal access agreements and tri-
lateral United States-Japan-Australia intel-
ligence sharing;

accelerated acquisition of asymmetric de-
fense capabilities, which are crucial to de-
fending the islands of Taiwan from invasion,

tions, anti-ship missiles, coastal defense, 
anti-armor, air defense, undersea warfare, 
advanced command, control, communica-
tions, computers, intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and resilient 
command and control capabilities, and in-
creasing the conduct of relevant and prac-
tical training and exercises with Taiwan’s 
defense forces; and 
(5) prioritizing building the capacity of 
United States allies and partners to protect 
defense technology. 
SEC. 3224. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

United States foreign policy, and prioritize 
resources for achieving United States polit-
ical and military objectives in the region;

States and Japan, signed at Washington Jan-
uary 19, 1960; 
(B) Article III of the Mutual Defense Trea-
ty between the United States and the Repub-
lic of Korea, signed at Washington October 1, 
1953; 
(C) Article IV of the Mutual Defense Trea-
ty between the United States and the Repub-
lic of the Philippines, signed at Washington 
August 30, 1951, including that, as the South 
China Sea is part of the Pacific, any armed

self-defeating; and 
(F) collaborating with allies and partners 
to accelerate their roles in more equitably 
sharing the burdens of mutual defense, in-
cluding through the acquisition and fielding

ON 
ARTIFICIAL 
LAND 
FEA-
TURES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress— 
(1) condemns coercive and threatening ac-
tions or the use of force to impede freedom of 
operations in international airspace by mili-
tary or civilian aircraft, to alter the status 
quo, or to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region; 
(2) urges the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China to refrain from imple-
menting the declared East China Sea Air De-
fense Identification Zone (ADIZ), or an ADIZ 
in the South China Sea, which is contrary to 
freedom of overflight in international air-
space, and to refrain from taking similar 
provocative actions elsewhere in the Indo- 
Pacific region; 
(3) reaffirms that the 2016 Permanent 
Court of Arbitration decision is final and le-
gally binding on both parties and that the 
People’s Republic of China’s claims to off-
shore resources across most of the South 
China Sea are unlawful; and 
(4) condemns the People’s Republic of 
China for failing to abide by the 2016 Perma-
nent Court of Arbitration ruling, despite the 
PRC’s obligations as a state party to the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States to— 
(1) reaffirm its commitment and support 
for allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, including longstanding United States 
policy regarding Article V of the United 
States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty 
and reaffirm its position that Article V of 
the United States-Japan Mutual Defense 
Treaty applies to the Japanese-administered 
Senkaku Islands; 
(2) oppose claims that impinge on the 
rights, freedoms, and lawful use of the sea, 
or the airspace above it, that belong to all 
nations, and oppose the militarization of new 
and reclaimed land features in the South 
China Sea; 
(3) continue certain policies with respect 
to the PRC claims in the South China Sea, 
namely— 
(A) that PRC claims in the South China 
Sea, including to offshore resources across 
most of the South China Sea, are unlawful; 
(B) that the PRC cannot lawfully assert a 
maritime claim vis-a`-vis the Philippines in 
areas that the Permanent Court of Arbitra-
tion found to be in the Philippines’ Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) or on its continental 
shelf; 
(C) to reject any PRC claim to waters be-
yond a 12 nautical mile territorial sea de-
rived from islands it claims in the Spratly 
Islands; and 
(D) that the PRC has no lawful territorial 
or maritime claim to James Shoal; 
(4) urge all parties to refrain from engag-
ing in destabilizing activities, including ille-
gal occupation or efforts to unlawfully assert 
administration over disputed claims; 
(5) ensure that disputes are managed with-
out intimidation, coercion, or force; 
(6) call on all claimants to clarify or adjust 
claims in accordance with international law; 
(7) uphold the principle that territorial and 
maritime 
claims, 
including 
territorial 
waters or territorial seas, must be derived 
from land features and otherwise comport 
with international law; 
(8) oppose the imposition of new fishing 
regulations covering disputed areas in the 
South China Sea, regulations which have 
raised tensions in the region; 
(9) support an effective Code of Conduct, if 
that Code of Conduct reflects the interests of 
Southeast Asian claimant states and does 
not serve as a vehicle for the People’s Repub-
lic of China to advance its unlawful mari-
time claims; 
(10) reaffirm that an existing body of inter-
national rules and guidelines, including the 
International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 
1972 (COLREGs), is sufficient to ensure the 
safety of navigation between the United 
States Armed Forces and the forces of other 
countries, including the People’s Republic of 
China; 
(11) support the development of regional 
institutions 
and 
bodies, 
including 
the 
ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN De-
fense Minister’s Meeting Plus, the East Asia 
Summit, and the expanded ASEAN Maritime 
Forum, to build practical cooperation in the 
region and reinforce the role of international 
law; 
(12) encourage the deepening of partner-
ships with other countries in the region for 
maritime domain awareness and capacity 
building, as well as efforts by the United 
States Government to explore the develop-
ment of appropriate multilateral mecha-
nisms for a ‘‘common operating picture’’ in 
the South China Sea among Southeast Asian 
countries that would serve to help countries 
avoid destabilizing behavior and deter risky 
and dangerous activities; 
(13) oppose actions by any country to pre-
vent any other country from exercising its 
sovereign rights to the resources of the ex-
clusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental 
shelf by making claims to those areas in the 
South China Sea that have no support in 
international law; and 
(14) assure the continuity of operations by 
the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, 
including, when appropriate, in cooperation 
with partners and allies, to reaffirm the 
principle of freedom of operations in inter-
national waters and airspace in accordance 
with established principles and practices of 
international law.

SEC. 3234. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING 
UNIVERSAL 
IMPLEMENTATION 
OF 
UNITED 
NATIONS 
SANCTIONS 
ON 
NORTH KOREA. 
It is the policy of the United States to sus-
tain maximum economic pressure on the 
Government of the Democratic People’s Re-
public of Korea (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘DPRK’’) until the regime undertakes 
complete, verifiable, and irreversible actions 
toward denuclearization, including by— 
(1) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
to implement and enforce existing United 
Nations sanctions with regard to the DPRK; 
(2) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
and in accordance with United Nations Secu-
rity Council resolutions, to end the practice 
of hosting DPRK citizens as guest workers, 
recognizing that such workers are dem-
onstrated to constitute an illicit source of 
revenue for the DPRK regime and its nuclear 
ambitions; 
(3) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
to pursue rigorous interdiction of shipments 
to and from the DPRK, including ship-to- 
ship transfers, consistent with United Na-
tions Security Council resolutions;

ica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act 
(Public Law 115–44), the Otto Warmbier

States executive orders. 
SEC. 3235. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO COUN-
TRIES HOSTING CHINESE MILITARY 
INSTALLATIONS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) although it casts the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative (BRI) as a development initiative, the 
People’s Republic of China is also utilizing 
the BRI to advance its own security inter-
ests, including to expand its power projec-
tion capabilities and facilitate greater access 
for the People’s Liberation Army through 
overseas military installations; and 
(2) the expansion of the People’s Liberation 
Army globally through overseas military in-
stallations will undermine the medium- and 
long-term security of the United States and 
the security and development of strategic 
partners in critical regions around the world, 
which is at odds with United States goals to 
promote peace, prosperity, and self-reliance 
among partner nations, including through 
the Millennium Challenge Corporation. 
(b) LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE.—Except as 
provided in subsection (c), for fiscal years 
2022 through 2031, the government of a coun-
try that is hosting on its territory a military 
installation of the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China or facilitates the ex-
pansion of the presence of the People’s Lib-
eration Army for purposes other than par-
ticipating in United Nations peacekeeping 
operations or for temporary humanitarian, 
medical, and disaster relief operations in 
such country shall not be eligible for assist-
ance under sections 609 or 616 of the Millen-
nium Challenge Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7708, 
7715). 
(c) 
NATIONAL
INTEREST
WAIVER.—The 
President may, on a case by case basis, waive 
the limitation in subsection (b) if the Presi-
dent submits to the appropriate congres-
sional committees— 
(1) a written determination that the waiver 
is important to the national interests of the 
United States; and 
(2) a detailed explanation of how the waiv-
er is important to those interests.

lies and partners—

from pursuing military aggression; 
(C) to promote the peaceful resolution of

term economic development while coun-
tering efforts by the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to leverage predatory 
economic practices as a means of political 
and economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific 
region and beyond; 
(E) to promote the values of democracy 
and human rights, including through efforts 
to end the repression by the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party 
of 
political 
dissidents, 
Uyghurs, and other ethnic Muslim minori-
ties, Tibetan Buddhists, Christians, and 
other minorities; 
(F) to respond to the crackdown by the 
Chinese Communist Party, in contravention 
of the commitments made under the Sino- 
British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the 
Basic Law of Hong Kong, on the legitimate 
aspirations of the people of Hong Kong; and 
(G) to counter the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s efforts to spread disinformation in the 
People’s Republic of China and beyond with 
respect to the response of the Chinese Com-
munist Party to COVID–19.

raphy, extensive personal connections, deep 
economic ties, mutual defense commitments, 
and a shared vision to uphold democracy, 
human rights, and the rules based inter-
national order established after World War 
II; 
(2) the United States and Canada can bet-
ter address the People’s Republic of China’s 
economic, political, and security influence 
through 
closer 
cooperation 
on 
counter-
narcotics, environmental stewardship, trans-
parent practices in public procurement and

and connectivity issues, trade and commer-
cial relations, bilateral legal matters, and

spect to the People’s Republic of China, and

challenges, 
including 
pandemics, energy security, and environ-
mental stewardship; 
(4) the United States and Canada should 
enhance cooperation to counter Chinese 
disinformation, influence operations, eco-
nomic espionage, and propaganda efforts; 
(5) the People’s Republic of China’s infra-
structure investments, particularly in 5G 
telecommunications technology, extraction 
of natural resources, and port infrastructure, 
pose national security risks for the United 
States and Canada; 
(6) the United States should share, as ap-
propriate, intelligence gathered regarding—

continue to advance collaborative initiatives 
to implement the January 9, 2020, United 
States-Canada Joint Action Plan on Critical 
Minerals Development Collaboration; and

prioritize cooperation on continental defense 
and in the Arctic, including by modernizing

mand (NORAD) to effectively defend the 
Northern Hemisphere against the range of 
threats by peer competitors, including long- 
range missiles and high-precision weapons. 
SEC. 3246. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE’S RE-
PUBLIC OF CHINA’S ARBITRARY IM-
PRISONMENT OF CANADIAN CITI-
ZENS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s apparent arbitrary detention 
and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals 
Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in appar-
ent retaliation for the Government of Can-
ada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou is deeply con-
cerning; 
(2) the Government of Canada has shown 
international leadership by— 
(A) upholding the rule of law and com-
plying with its international legal obliga-
tions, including those pursuant to the Extra-
dition Treaty Between the United States of 
America and Canada, signed at Washington 
December 3, 1971; and 
(B) launching the Declaration Against Ar-
bitrary Detention in State-to-State Rela-
tions, which has been endorsed by 57 coun-
tries and the European Union, and reaffirms 
well-established prohibitions under inter-
national human rights conventions against 
the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals 
to be used as leverage in state-to-state rela-
tions; and 
(3) the United States continues to join the 
Government of Canada in calling for the im-

Congress that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China is exporting its model for inter-

(2) the inclusion of communication net-
works and communications supply chains 
with equipment and services from companies 
with close ties to or that are susceptible to

PART II—TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE 
SEC. 3255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TRANS-
ATLANTIC ALLIANCE. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries are close partners, shar-
ing values grounded in democracy, human 
rights, transparency, and the rules-based 
international order established after World 
War II; 
(2) without a common approach by the 
United States, European Union, and Euro-
pean 
countries 
on 
connectivity, 
trade, 
transnational problems, and support for de-
mocracy and human rights, the People’s Re-
public of China will continue to increase its 
economic, political, and security leverage in 
Europe; 
(3) the People’s Republic of China’s deploy-
ment of assistance to European countries 
following the COVID–19 outbreak showcased 
a coercive approach to aid, but it also high-
lighted Europe’s deep economic ties to the 
People’s Republic of China; 
(4) as European states seek to recover from 
the economic toll of the COVID–19 outbreak, 
the United States must stand in partnership 
with Europe to support our collective eco-
nomic recovery, reinforce our collective na-
tional security, and defend shared values; 
(5) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries should coordinate on 
joint strategies to diversify reliance on sup-
ply chains away from the People’s Republic 
of China, especially in the medical and phar-
maceutical sectors; 
(6) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries should leverage their re-
spective economic innovation capabilities to 
support the global economic recovery from 
the COVID–19 recession and draw a contrast 
with the centralized economy of the People’s 
Republic of China; 
(7) the United States, United Kingdom, and 
European Union should accelerate efforts to 
de-escalate their trade disputes, including 
negotiating a United States-European Union 
trade agreement that benefits workers and 
the broader economy in both the United 
States and European Union; 
(8) the United States, European Union, and 
Japan should continue trilateral efforts to 
address economic challenges posed by the 
People’s Republic of China; 
(9) the United States, European Union, and 
countries of Europe should enhance coopera-
tion to counter PRC disinformation, influ-
ence operations, and propaganda efforts; 
(10) the United States and European na-
tions share serious concerns with the repres-
sions being supported and executed by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, and should continue implementing 
measures to address the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China’s specific abuses 
in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, and 
should build joint mechanisms and programs 
to prevent the export of China’s authori-
tarian governance model to countries around 
the world; 
(11) the United States and European na-
tions should remain united in their shared 
values against attempts by the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China at the 
United Nations and other multilateral orga-
nizations to promote efforts that erode the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, like 
the ‘‘community of a shared future for man-
kind’’ and ‘‘democratization of international 
relations’’; 
(12) the People’s Republic of China’s infra-
structure investments around the world, par-
ticularly in 5G telecommunications tech-
nology and port infrastructure, could threat-
en democracy across Europe and the na-
tional security of key countries; 
(13) as appropriate, the United States 
should share intelligence with European al-
lies and partners on Huawei’s 5G capabilities 
and the intentions of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China with respect to 
5G expansion in Europe; 
(14) the European Union’s Investment 
Screening Regulation, which came into force 
in October 2020, is a welcome development, 
and member states should closely scrutinize 
PRC investments in their countries through 
their own national investment screening 
measures; 
(15) the President should actively engage 
the European Union on the implementation 
of the Export Control Reform Act regula-
tions and to better harmonize United States 
and European Union policies with respect to 
export controls; 
(16) the President should strongly advocate 
for the listing of more items and tech-
nologies to restrict dual use exports con-
trolled at the National Security and above 
level to the People’s Republic of China under 
the Wassenaar Arrangement; 
(17) the United States should explore the 
value of establishing a body akin to the Co-
ordinating Committee for Multilateral Ex-
port Controls (CoCom) that would specifi-
cally coordinate United States and European 
Union export control policies with respect to 
limiting exports of sensitive technologies to 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(18) the United States should work with 
counterparts in Europe to— 
(A) evaluate United States and European 
overreliance on goods originating in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, including in the 
medical and pharmaceutical sectors, and de-
velop joint strategies to diversify supply 
chains; 
(B) counter PRC efforts to use COVID–19- 
related assistance as a coercive tool to pres-
sure developing countries by offering rel-
evant United States and European expertise 
and assistance; and 
(C) leverage the United States and Euro-
pean private sectors to advance the post- 
COVID–19 economic recovery.

human activity in the Arctic region where 
search and rescue capacity remains very lim-
ited; and

SEC. 3295. REPORT ON COUNTERING ILLEGAL, 
UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED 
FISHING IN OCEANIA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) many countries of the Oceania region 
depend on commercial tuna fisheries as a 
critical component of their economies; 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has used its licensed fishing fleet 
to exert greater influence in Oceania, but at 
the same time, its licensed fishing fleet is 
also a major contributor to illegal, unre-
ported, and unregulated fishing (in this sec-
tion referred to as ‘‘IUU fishing’’) activities; 
(3) the sustainability of Oceania’s fisheries 
is threatened by IUU fishing, which depletes 
both commercially important fish stocks 
and non-targeted species that help maintain 
the integrity of the ocean ecosystem; 
(4) in addition, IUU fishing puts pressure 
on protected species of marine mammals, sea 
turtles, and sea birds, which also jeopardizes 
the integrity of the ocean ecosystem; 
(5) further, because IUU fishing goes unre-
corded, the loss of biomass compromises sci-
entists’ work to assess and model fishery 
stocks and advise managers on sustainable 
catch levels; 
(6) beyond the damage to living marine re-
sources, IUU fishing also contributes di-
rectly to illegal activity in the Oceania re-
gion, such as food fraud, smuggling, and 
human trafficking; 
(7) current approaches to IUU fishing en-
forcement rely on established methods, such 
as vessel monitoring systems, logbooks 
maintained by government fisheries enforce-
ment authorities to record the catches land-
ed by fishing vessels, and corroborating data 
on catches hand-collected by human observer 
programs; 
(8) such established methods are imperfect 
because— 
(A) vessels can turn off monitoring sys-
tems and unlicensed vessels do not use them; 
and 
(B) observer coverage is thin and subject to 
human error and corruption; 
(9) maritime domain awareness technology 
solutions for vessel monitoring have gained 
credibility in recent years and include sys-
tems such as observing instruments deployed 
on satellites, crewed and uncrewed air and 
surface systems, aircraft, and surface ves-
sels, as well as electronic monitoring sys-
tems on fishing vessels; 
(10) maritime domain awareness tech-
nologies hold the promise of significantly 
augmenting the current IUU fishing enforce-
ment capacities; and

(11) maritime domain awareness tech-
nologies offer an avenue for addressing key 
United States national interests, including 
those interests related to— 
(A) increasing bilateral diplomatic ties 
with key allies and partners in the Oceania 
region; 
(B) countering illicit trafficking in arms, 
narcotics, and human beings associated with 
IUU fishing; 
(C) advancing security, long-term growth, 
and development in the Oceania region; 
(D) supporting ocean conservation objec-
tives;

(F) countering attempts by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
grow its influence in the Oceania region.

mandant of the Coast Guard, and the Sec-
retary of Defense, shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a report as-
sessing the use of advanced maritime domain 
awareness technology systems to combat 
IUU fishing in Oceania. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a review of the effectiveness of existing 
monitoring 
technologies, 
including 
elec-
tronic monitoring systems, to combat IUU 
fishing; 
(B) recommendations for effectively inte-
grating effective monitoring technologies 
into a Oceania-wide strategy for IUU fishing 
enforcement; 
(C) an assessment and recommendations 
for the secure and reliable processing of data 
from such monitoring technologies, includ-
ing the security and verification issues; 
(D) the technical and financial capacity of 
countries of the Oceania region to deploy 
and maintain large-scale use of maritime do-
main awareness technological systems for 
the purposes of combating IUU fishing and 
supporting fisheries resource management; 
(E) a review of the technical and financial 
capacity of regional organizations and inter-
national structures to support countries of 
the Oceania region in the deployment and 
maintenance of large-scale use of maritime 
domain awareness technology systems for 
the purposes of combating IUU fishing and 
supporting fisheries resource management; 
(F) an evaluation of the utility of using 
foreign assistance, security assistance, and 
development assistance provided by the 
United States to countries of the Oceania re-
gion to support the large-scale deployment 
and operations of maritime domain aware-
ness systems to increase maritime security 
across the region; and 
(G) an assessment of the role of large-scale 
deployment and operations of maritime do-
main awareness systems throughout Oceania 
to supporting United States economic and 
national security interests in the Oceania re-
gion, including efforts related to countering 
IUU fishing, improving maritime security, 
and countering malign foreign influence.

OF POLICY.—It is the 
policy of the United States, as provided 
under section 342(b) of division FF of the

the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China or any other government in the proc-
ess of recognizing a successor or reincarna-
tion of the 14th Dalai Lama and any future

dhists the 15th Dalai Lama; and

gious freedom of Tibetan Buddhists. 
SEC. 3308. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TREATMENT 
OF UYGHURS AND OTHER ETHNIC 
MINORITIES 
IN 
THE 
XINJIANG 
UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Uyghurs are one of several pre-
dominantly Muslim Turkic groups living in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
(XUAR) in the northwest of the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). 
(2) Following Uyghur demonstrations and 
unrest in 2009 and clashes with government 
security personnel and other violent inci-
dents in subsequent years, PRC leaders 
sought to ‘‘stabilize’’ the XUAR through 
large-scale arrests and extreme security 
measures, under the pretext of combatting 
alleged terrorism, religious extremism, and 
ethnic separatism. 
(3) In May 2014, the PRC launched its 
‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism’’ 
campaign, which placed further restrictions 
on and facilitated additional human rights 
violations against minorities in the XUAR 
under the pretext of fighting terrorism. 
(4) In August 2016, Chinese Communist 
Party 
(CCP) 
Politburo 
member 
Chen 
Quanguo, former Tibet Autonomous Region 
(TAR) Party Secretary, known for over-
seeing intensifying security operations and 
human rights abuses in the TAR, was ap-
pointed as Party Secretary of the XUAR. 
(5) Beginning in 2017, XUAR authorities 
have 
sought 
to 
forcibly 
‘‘assimilate’’ 
Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities into 
Chinese society through a policy of cultural 
erasure known as ‘‘Sinicization’’. 
(6) Since 2018, credible reporting including 
from the BBC, France24, and the New York 
Times has shown that the Government of the 
PRC has built mass internment camps in the 
XUAR, which it calls ‘‘vocational training’’ 
centers, and detained Uyghurs and other 
groups in them and other facilities. 
(7) Since 2015, XUAR authorities have arbi-
trarily 
detained 
an 
estimated 
1,500,000 
Uyghurs—12.5 percent of the XUAR’s official 
Uyghur population of 12,000,000—and a small-
er number of other ethnic minorities in the 
‘‘vocational training’’ centers and other de-
tention and pre-detention facilities. 
(8) In 2017, the XUAR accounted for less 
than two percent of the PRC’s total popu-
lation but 21 percent of all arrests in China. 
(9) The Atlantic, Radio Free Asia, and 
other sources have revealed that detainees 
are forced to renounce many of their Islamic 
beliefs and customs and repudiate Uyghur 
culture, language, and identity. 
(10) Investigations by Human Rights Watch 
and other human rights organizations have 
documented how detainees are subject to po-
litical indoctrination, forced labor, crowded 
and unsanitary conditions, involuntary bio-
metric data collection, both medical neglect 
and intrusive medical interventions, food 
and water deprivation, beatings, sexual vio-
lence, and torture. 
(11) Research by the Australian Strategic 
Policy Institute suggests that, since late 
2019, many detainees have been placed in 
higher security facilities and convicted of 
formal crimes. 
(12) Human Rights Watch has reported that 
the PRC uses data collection programs, in-
cluding facial recognition technology, to 
surveil Uyghurs in the XUAR and to identify 
individuals whom authorities may detain. 
(13) PRC authorities have placed countless 
children whose parents are detained or in 
exile in state-run institutions and boarding 
schools without the consent of their parents. 
(14) New York Times reporting revealed 
that numerous local PRC officials who did 
not agree with the policies carried out in 
XUAR have been fired and imprisoned. 
(15) Associated Press reporting documented 
widespread and systemic efforts by PRC au-
thorities to force Uyghur women to take 
contraceptives or to subject them to steri-
lization or abortion, threatening to detain 
those who do not comply. 
(16) PRC authorities prohibit family mem-
bers and advocates inside and outside China 
from having regular communications with

relatives and friends imprisoned in the 
XUAR, such as journalist and entrepreneur 
Ekpar Asat. 
(17) PRC authorities have imposed perva-
sive restrictions on the peaceful practice of 
Islam in the XUAR, to the extent that 
Human Rights Watch asserts the PRC ‘‘has 
effectively outlawed the practice of Islam’’. 
(18) Individuals who are not detained in 
camps have been forced to attend political 
indoctrination sessions, subjected to move-
ment restrictions, mass surveillance sys-
tems, involuntary biometric data collection, 
and other human rights abuses. 
(19) International media, nongovernmental 
organizations, scholars, families, and sur-
vivors have reported on the systemic nature 
of many of these abuses. 
(20) On June 26, 2020, a group of 50 inde-
pendent United Nations experts jointly ex-
pressed alarm over China’s deteriorating 
human rights record, including its repression 
in Xinjiang, and called on the international 
community ‘‘to act collectively and deci-
sively to ensure China respects human rights 
and abides by its international obligations’’. 
(21) On October 6, 2020, 39 United Nations 
member countries issued a public statement 
condemning human rights violations by PRC 
authorities and calling on the PRC to allow 
the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights unfettered access to Xinjiang. 
(22) The United States Congress passed the 
Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 
(Public Law 116–145). 
(23) The United States Congress passed the 
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public 
Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), which has 
been used to sanction PRC officials and enti-
ties for their activities in the XUAR. 
(24) The United States Government has im-
plemented additional targeted restrictions 
on trade with Xinjiang and imposed visa and 
economic sanctions on PRC officials and en-
tities for their activities in the XUAR. 
(25) The United States Government has 
documented human rights abuses and viola-
tions of individual freedoms in the XUAR, 
including in the 2019 Department of State 
Report on International Religious Freedom. 
(26) On January 19, 2021, then-Secretary of 
State Michael Pompeo ‘‘determined that the 
PRC, under the direction and control of the 
CCP, has committed genocide against the 
predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang’’. 
(27) On January 19, 2021, during his con-
firmation 
hearing, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony Blinken testified that ‘‘forcing men, 
women, and children into concentration 
camps, trying to in effect reeducate them to 
be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
Party—all of that speaks to an effort to com-
mit genocide’’. 
(28) On January 19, 2021, Secretary of the 
Treasury Janet L. Yellen, during her con-
firmation 
hearing, 
publicly 
stated 
that 
China is guilty of ‘‘horrendous human rights 
abuses’’. 
(29) On January 27, 2021, in response to a 
question 
from 
the 
press 
regarding 
the 
Uyghurs, Secretary Blinken stated that his 
‘‘judgement remains that genocide was com-
mitted against the Uyghurs’’. 
(30) On March 10, 2021, in response to a 
question on Xinjiang during his testimony 
before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives, Secretary 
Blinken reiterated, ‘‘We’ve been clear, and 
I’ve been clear, that I see it as genocide, 
other egregious abuses of human rights, and 
we’ll continue to make that clear.’’. 
(31) The 2020 Department of State Country 
Reports on Human Rights Practices: China 
states that ‘‘[g]enocide and crimes against 
humanity occurred during the year against 
the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and 
other ethnic and religious minority groups 
in Xinjiang’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the atrocities committed by the CCP 
against Uyghurs and other predominantly 
Muslim Turkic groups in Xinjiang, including 
forced labor, sexual violence, the internment 
of over 1,000,000 individuals, and other hor-
rific abuses must be condemned; 
(2) the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the United States Ambassador to the 
United Nations should speak publicly about 
the ongoing human rights abuses in the 
XUAR, including in formal speeches at the 
United Nations and other international fora; 
(3) the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the United States Ambassador to the 
United Nations should appeal to the United 
Nations Secretary-General to take a more 
proactive and public stance on the situation 
in the XUAR, including by supporting calls 
for an investigation and accountability for 
individuals and entities involved in abuses 
against the people of the XUAR; 
(4) the United States should continue to 
use targeted sanctions and all diplomatic 
tools available to hold those responsible for 
the atrocities in Xinjiang to account; 
(5) United States agencies engaged with 
China on trade, climate, defense, or other bi-
lateral issues should include human rights 
abuses in the XUAR as a consideration in de-
veloping United States policy; 
(6) the United States supports Radio Free 
Asia Uyghur, the only Uyghur-language news 
service in the world independent of Chinese 
government influence; and 
(7) the United States recognizes the re-
peated requests from the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
unfettered access to the XUAR and the 
PRC’s refusal to comply, and therefore— 
(A) PRC authorities must allow unfettered 
access by the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
XUAR; 
(B) the United States should urge collabo-
rative action between the United States Gov-
ernment and international partners to pres-
sure PRC authorities to allow unfettered ac-
cess to the XUAR; 
(C) the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the United States Ambassador to the 
United Nations should simultaneously out-
line a strategy to investigate the human 
rights abuses and crimes that have taken 
place in the XUAR, collect evidence, and 
transfer the evidence to a competent court; 
and 
(D) United States partners and allies 
should undertake similar strategies in an ef-
fort to build an international investigation 
outside of the PRC if PRC authorities do not 
comply with a United Nations investigation 
in the XUAR.

Joint Declaration by suppressing the basic 
rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers.

lic of China continues to utilize the National

(4) Article 9 of the National Security Law

TITLE IV—INVESTING IN OUR ECONOMIC 
STATECRAFT 
SEC. 3401. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS 
REGARDING THE PRC’S INDUSTRIAL 
POLICY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China, at the 
direction of the Chinese Communist Party, is 
advancing an ecosystem of anticompetitive 
economic and industrial policies that— 
(A) distort global markets; 
(B) limit innovation; 
(C) unfairly advantage PRC firms at the 
expense of the United States and other for-
eign firms; and 
(D) unfairly and harmfully prejudice con-
sumer choice. 
(2) Of the extensive and systemic economic 
and industrial policies pursued by the PRC, 
the mass subsidization of PRC firms, intel-
lectual property theft, and forced technology 
transfer are among the most damaging to 
the global economy. 
(3) Through regulatory interventions and 
direct financial subsidies, the CCP, for the 
purposes of advancing national political and 
economic objectives, directs, coerces, and in-
fluences in anti-competitive ways the com-
mercial activities of firms that are directed, 
financed, influenced, or otherwise controlled 
by the state, including state-owned enter-
prises, and ostensibly independent and pri-
vate Chinese companies, such as technology 
firms in strategic sectors. 
(4) The PRC Government, at the national 
and subnational levels, grants special privi-
leges or status to certain PRC firms in key 
sectors designated as strategic, such as tele-
communications, oil, power, aviation, bank-
ing, and semiconductors. Enterprises receive 
special state preferences in the form of fa-
vorable loans, tax exemptions, and pref-
erential land access from the CCP. 
(5) The subsidization of PRC companies, as 
described in paragraphs (3) and (4)— 
(A) enables these companies to sell goods 
below market prices, allowing them to out-
bid and crowd out market-based competitors 
and thereby pursue global dominance of key 
sectors; 
(B) distorts the global market economy by 
undermining longstanding and generally ac-
cepted market-based principles of fair com-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2692 
May 18, 2021 
(6) The CCP incentivizes and empowers 
PRC actors to steal critical technologies and 
trade secrets from private and foreign com-
petitors operating in the PRC and around 
the world, particularly in areas that the CCP 
has identified as critical to advancing PRC 
objectives. The PRC, as directed by the CCP, 
also continues to implement anti-competi-
tive regulations, policies, and practices that 
coerce the handover of technology and other 
propriety or sensitive data from foreign en-
terprises to domestic firms in exchange for 
access to the PRC market. 
(7) Companies in the United States and in 
foreign countries compete with state-sub-
sidized PRC companies that enjoy the pro-
tection and power of the state in third-coun-
try markets around the world. The advan-
tages granted to PRC firms, combined with 
significant restrictions to accessing the PRC 
market itself, severely hamper the ability of 
United States and foreign firms to compete, 
innovate, and pursue the provision of best 
value to customers. The result is an unbal-
anced playing field. Such an unsustainable 
course, if not checked, will over time lead to 
depressed competition around the world, re-
duced opportunity, and harm to both pro-
ducers and consumers. 
(8) As stated in the United States Trade 
Representative’s investigation of the PRC’s 
trade practices under section 301 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411), conducted 
in March 2018, ‘‘When U.S. companies are de-
prived of fair returns on their investment in 
IP, they are unable to achieve the growth 
necessary to reinvest in innovation. In this 
sense, China’s technology transfer regime di-
rectly burdens the innovation ecosystem 
that is an engine of economic growth in the 
United States and similarly-situated econo-
mies.’’. 
(9) In addition to forced technology trans-
fers described in this subsection, the United 
States Trade Representative’s investigation 
of the PRC under section 301 of the Trade 
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) also identified re-
quirements that foreign firms license prod-
ucts at less than market value, government- 
directed and government-subsidized acquisi-
tion of sensitive technology for strategic 
purposes, and cyber theft as other key PRC 
technology and industrial policies that are 
unreasonable and discriminatory. These poli-
cies place at risk United States intellectual 
property rights, innovation and techno-
logical development, and jobs in dozens of in-
dustries. 
(10) Other elements of the PRC’s ecosystem 
of industrial policies that harm innovation 
and distort global markets include— 
(A) advancement of policies that encourage 
local production over imports; 
(B) continuation of policies that favor 
unique technical standards in use by PRC 
firms rather than globally accepted stand-
ards, which often force foreign firms to alter 
their products and manufacturing chains to 
compete; 
(C) requirements that foreign companies 
disclose proprietary information to qualify 
for the adoption of their standards for use in 
the PRC domestic market; and 
(D) maintenance of closed procurement 
processes, which limit participation by for-
eign firms, including by setting terms that 
require such firms to use domestic suppliers, 
transfer know-how to firms in the PRC, and 
disclose proprietary information. 
(11) The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and 
associated industry-specific efforts under 
this initiative, such as the Digital Silk Road, 
are key vectors to advance the PRC’s mer-
cantilist policies and practices globally. The 
resulting challenges do not only affect 
United States firms. As the European Cham-
ber of Commerce reported in a January 2020 
report, the combination of concessional lend-
ing to PRC state-owned enterprises, non-
transparent procurement and bidding proc-
esses, closed digital standards, and other fac-
tors severely limit European and other par-
ticipation in BRI and make ‘‘competition 
[with PRC companies] in third-country mar-
kets extremely challenging’’. This under-
scores a key objective of BRI, which is to en-
sure the reliance of infrastructure, digital 
technologies, and other important goods on 
PRC supply chains and technical standards. 
(12) On January 9, 2021, the Ministry of 
Commerce of the PRC issued Order No. 1 of 
2021, entitled ‘‘Rules on Counteracting Un-
justified Extraterritorial Application of For-
eign Legislation and other Measures’’, which 
establishes a blocking regime in response to 
foreign sanctions on Chinese individuals and 
entities. That order allows the Government 
of the PRC to designate specific foreign laws 
as ‘‘unjustified extraterritorial application 
of foreign legislation’’ and to prohibit com-
pliance with such foreign laws. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the challenges presented by a non-
market economy like the PRC’s economy, 
which has captured such a large share of 
global economic exchange, are in many ways 
unprecedented and require sufficiently ele-
vated and sustained long-term focus and en-
gagement; 
(2) in order to truly address the most detri-
mental aspects of CCP-directed mercantilist 
economic strategy, the United States must 
adopt policies that— 
(A) expose the full scope and scale of intel-
lectual property theft and mass subsidiza-
tion of Chinese firms, and the resulting harm 
to the United States, foreign markets, and 
the global economy; 
(B) ensure that PRC companies face costs 
and consequences for anticompetitive behav-
ior; 
(C) provide options for affected United 
States persons to address and respond to un-
reasonable and discriminatory CCP-directed 
industrial policies; and 
(D) strengthen the protection of critical 
technology and sensitive data, while still 
fostering an environment that provides in-
centives for innovation and competition; 
(3) the United States must work with its 
allies and partners through the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), the World Trade Organization, and 
other venues and fora— 
(A) to reinforce long-standing generally ac-
cepted principles of fair competition and 
market behavior and address the PRC’s anti-
competitive economic and industrial policies 
that undermine decades of global growth and 
innovation; 
(B) to ensure that the PRC is not granted 
the same treatment as that of a free-market 
economy until it ceases the implementation 
of laws, regulations, policies, and practices 
that provide unfair advantage to PRC firms 
in furtherance of national objectives and im-
pose unreasonable, discriminatory, and ille-
gal burdens on market-based international 
commerce; and 
(C) to align policies with respect to curbing 
state-directed subsidization of the private 
sector, such as advocating for global rules 
related to transparency and adherence to no-
tification requirements, including through 
the efforts currently being advanced by the 
United States, Japan, and the European 
Union; 
(4) the United States and its allies and 
partners must collaborate to provide incen-
tives to their respective companies to co-
operate in areas such as— 
(A) advocating for protection of intellec-
tual property rights in markets around the 
world; 
(B) fostering open technical standards; and 
(C) increasing joint investments in over-
seas markets; and 
(5) the United States should develop poli-
cies that— 
(A) insulate United States entities from 
PRC pressure against complying with United 
States laws; 
(B) counter the potential impact of the 
blocking regime of the PRC described in sub-
section (a)(12), including by working with al-
lies and partners of the United States and 
multilateral institutions; and 
(C) plan for future actions that the Govern-
ment of the PRC may take to undermine the 
lawful application of United States legal au-
thorities, including with respect to the use 
of sanctions.

TITLE V—ENSURING STRATEGIC 
SECURITY 
SEC. 3501. FINDINGS ON STRATEGIC SECURITY 
AND ARMS CONTROL. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and the PRC have 
both made commitments to advancing stra-
tegic security through enforceable arms con-
trol and non-proliferation agreements as 
states parties to the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Wash-
ington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968. 
(2) The United States has long taken tan-
gible steps to seek effective, verifiable, and 
enforceable arms control and non-prolifera-
tion agreements that support United States 
and allied security by— 
(A) controlling the spread of nuclear mate-
rials and technology; 
(B) placing limits on the production, 
stockpiling, 
and 
deployment 
of 
nuclear 
weapons; 
(C) decreasing misperception and mis-
calculation; and 
(D) avoiding destabilizing nuclear arms 
competition. 
(3) In May 2019, Director of the Defense In-
telligence Agency Lieutenant General Rob-
ert Ashley stated, ‘‘China is likely to at 
least double the size of its nuclear stockpile 
in the course of implementing the most rapid 
expansion and diversification of its nuclear 
arsenal in China’s history.’’. The PLA is 
building a full triad of modernized fixed and 
mobile ground-based launchers and new ca-
pabilities for nuclear-armed bombers and 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 
(4) In June 2020, the Department of State 
raised concerns in its annual ‘‘Adherence to 
and Compliance with Arms Control, Non-
proliferation, and Disarmament Agreements 
and Commitments’’ report to Congress that 
the PRC is not complying with the ‘‘zero- 
yield’’ nuclear testing ban and accused the 
PRC of ‘‘blocking the flow of data from the 
monitoring stations’’ in China. 
(5) The Department of Defense 2020 Report 
on Military and Security Developments In-
volving the People’s Republic of China states 
that the PRC ‘‘intends to increase peacetime 
readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to 
a launch on warning posture with an ex-
panded silo-based force’’. 
(6) The Department of Defense report also 
states that, over the next decade, the PRC’s 
nuclear stockpile—currently estimated in 
the low 200s—is projected to least double in 
size as the PRC expands and modernizes its 
nuclear force. 
(7) The PRC is conducting research on its 
first potential early warning radar, with 
technical cooperation from Russia. This 
radar could indicate that the PRC is moving 
to a launch-on warning posture. 
(8) The PRC plans to use its increasingly 
capable space, cyber, and electronic warfare 
capabilities against United States early 
warning systems and critical infrastructure 
in a crisis scenario. This poses great risk to 
strategic security, as it could lead to inad-
vertent escalation. 
(9) The PRC’s nuclear expansion comes as 
a part of a massive modernization of the 
PLA which, combined with the PLA’s ag-
gressive actions, has increasingly desta-
bilized the Indo-Pacific region. 
(10) The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), 
which was elevated in 2015 to become a sepa-
rate branch within the PLA, has formed 11 
new missile brigades since May 2017, some of 
which are capable of both conventional and 
nuclear strikes. Unlike the United States, 
which separates its conventional strike and 
nuclear capabilities, the PLARF appears to 
not only co-locate conventional and nuclear 
forces, including dual-use missiles like the 
DF–26, but to task the same unit with both 
nuclear and conventional missions. Such 
intermingling could lead to inadvertent es-
calation in a crisis. The United States De-
fense Intelligence Agency determined in 
March 2020 that the PLA tested more bal-
listic missiles than the rest of the world 
combined in 2019. 
(11) A January 2021 report from the Insti-
tute for Defense Analysis found that many 
United States and international observers 
viewed China’s no first-use policy with skep-
ticism, especially in the wake of the expan-
sion and modernization of its nuclear capa-
bilities. 
(12) The long-planned United States nu-
clear modernization program will not in-
crease the United States nuclear weapons 
stockpile, 
predates 
China’s 
conventional 
military and nuclear expansion, and is not 
an arms race against China. 
(13) The United States extended nuclear de-
terrence— 
(A) provides critical strategic security 
around the world;

(B) is an essential element of United States 
military alliances; and 
(C) serves a vital non-proliferation func-
tion. 
(14) As a signatory to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done 
at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 
1968, the PRC is obligated under Article Six 
of the treaty to pursue arms control negotia-
tions in good faith. 
(15) The United States has, on numerous 
occasions, called on the PRC to participate 
in strategic arms control negotiations, but 
the PRC has thus far declined. 
(16) The Governments of Japan, the United 
Kingdom, Poland, Slovenia, Denmark, Nor-
way, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Nether-
lands, 
Romania, 
Austria, 
Montenegro, 
Ukraine, Slovakia, Spain, North Macedonia, 
Sweden, the Czech Republic, Croatia, and Al-
bania, as well as the Deputy Secretary Gen-
eral of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, have all encouraged the PRC to join 
arms control discussions. 
SEC. 3502. COOPERATION ON A STRATEGIC NU-
CLEAR DIALOGUE. 
(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to pursue, in coordination with United 
States allies, arms control negotiations and 
sustained and regular engagement with the 
PRC— 
(A) to enhance understanding of each oth-
er’s respective nuclear policies, doctrine, and 
capabilities; 
(B) to improve transparency; and 
(C) to help manage the risks of miscalcula-
tion and misperception; 
(2) to formulate a strategy to engage the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China on relevant bilateral issues that lays 
the groundwork for bringing the People’s Re-
public of China into an arms control frame-
work, including— 
(A) fostering bilateral dialogue on arms 
control leading to the convening of bilateral 
strategic security talks; 
(B) negotiating norms for outer space; 
(C) developing pre-launch notification re-
gimes aimed at reducing nuclear miscalcula-
tion; and 
(D) expanding lines of communication be-
tween both governments for the purposes of 
reducing the risks of conventional war and 
increasing transparency; 
(3) to pursue relevant capabilities in co-
ordination with our allies and partners to 
ensure the security of United States and al-
lied interests in the face of the PRC’s mili-
tary modernization and expansion, includ-
ing— 
(A) ground-launched cruise and ballistic 
missiles; 
(B) integrated air and missile defense; 
(C) hypersonic missiles; 
(D) intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance; 
(E) space-based capabilities; 
(F) cyber capabilities; and 
(G) command, control, and communica-
tions; 
(4) to maintain sufficient force structure, 
posture, and capabilities to provide extended 
nuclear deterrence to United States allies 
and partners; 
(5) to maintain appropriate missile defense 
capabilities to protect against threats to the 
United States homeland and our forces 
across the theater from rogue interconti-
nental ballistic missiles from the Indo-Pa-
cific region; and 
(6) to ensure that the United States declar-
atory policy reflects the requirements of ex-
tended deterrence, to both assure allies and 
to preserve its non-proliferation benefits. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) in the midst of growing competition be-
tween the United States and the PRC, it is in 
the interest of both nations to cooperate in 
reducing risks of conventional and nuclear 
escalation; 
(2) a physical, cyber, electronic, or any 
other PLA attack on United States early 
warning satellites, other portions of the nu-
clear command and control enterprise, or 
critical infrastructure poses a high risk to 
inadvertent but rapid escalation; 
(3) the United States and its allies should 
promote international norms on military op-
erations in space, the employment of cyber 
capabilities, and the military use of artifi-
cial intelligence, as an element of risk reduc-
tion regarding nuclear command and con-
trol; and 
(4) United States allies and partners should 
share the burden of promoting and pro-
tecting such norms by voting against the 
PRC’s proposals regarding the weaponization 
of space, highlighting unsafe behavior by the 
PRC that violates international norms, such 
as in rendezvous and proximity operations, 
and promoting responsible behavior in space 
and all other domains.

and if necessary a separate classified annex, 
that examines the approaches and strategic 
effects of engaging the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China on arms control 
and risk reduction, including— 
(1) areas of potential dialogue between the 
Governments of the United States and the 
People’s Republic of China, including on bal-
listic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missiles, 
conventional forces, nuclear, space, and 
cyberspace issues, as well as other new stra-
tegic domains, which could reduce the likeli-
hood of war, limit escalation if a conflict 
were to occur, and constrain a destabilizing 
arms race in the Indo-Pacific; 
(2) how the United States Government can 
incentivize the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China to engage in a construc-
tive arms control dialogue; 
(3) identifying strategic military capabili-
ties of the People’s Republic of China that 
the United States Government is most con-
cerned about and how limiting these capa-
bilities may benefit United States and allied 
security interests; 
(4) mechanisms to avoid, manage, or con-
trol nuclear, conventional, and unconven-
tional 
military 
escalation 
between 
the 
United States and the People’s Republic of 
China;

scribes— 
(1) a concrete plan for arms control talks 
that includes both the People’s Republic of 
China and the Russian Federation; 
(2) if a trilateral arms control dialogue

States extended deterrence assurances to al-
lies and partners if the United States is faced 
with two nuclear-armed peer competitors 
and any likely corresponding implications 
for regional security architectures; 
(4) efforts at engaging the People’s Repub-
lic of China to join arms control talks, 
whether on a bilateral or multilateral basis; 
and 
(5) the interest level of the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China in joining

multilateral basis. 
(c) APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS 
DEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘appro-
priate committees of Congress’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations,

of the Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the 
Committee on Armed Services, and the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3504. COUNTERING THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-
LIC OF CHINA’S PROLIFERATION OF 
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND NUCLEAR 
TECHNOLOGY TO THE MIDDLE EAST. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China became 
a full participant of the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group in 2004, committing it to apply a 
strong presumption of denial in exporting 
nuclear-related items that a foreign country 
could divert to a nuclear weapons program. 
(2) The People’s Republic of China also 
committed to the United States, in Novem-
ber 2000, to abide by the foundational prin-
ciples of the 1987 Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) to not ‘‘assist, in any way, 
any country in the development of ballistic 
missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear 
weapons (i.e., missiles capable of delivering a 
payload of at least 500 kilograms to a dis-
tance of at least 300 kilometers)’’. 
(3) The 2020 Department of State Report on 
the Adherence to and Compliance with Arms 
Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament 
Agreements and Commitments found that 
the People’s Republic of China ‘‘continued to 
supply MTCR-controlled goods to missile 
programs of proliferation concern in 2019’’ 
and that the United States imposed sanc-
tions on nine Chinese entities for covered 
missile transfers to Iran. 
(4) A June 5, 2019, press report indicated 
that the People’s Republic of China allegedly 
provided assistance to Saudi Arabia in the 
development of a ballistic missile facility, 
which if confirmed, would violate the pur-
pose of the MTCR and run contrary to the 
longstanding United States policy priority 
to prevent weapons of mass destruction pro-
liferation in the Middle East. 
(5) The Arms Export and Control Act of 
1976 (Public Law 93–329) requires the Presi-
dent to sanction any foreign person or gov-
ernment who knowingly ‘‘exports, transfers, 
or otherwise engages in the trade of any 
MTCR equipment or technology’’ to a coun-
try that does not adhere to the MTCR. 
(6) The People’s Republic of China con-
cluded two nuclear cooperation agreements 
with Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2017, respec-
tively, which may facilitate the People’s Re-
public of China’s bid to build two reactors in 
Saudi Arabia to generate 2.9 Gigawatt-elec-
tric (GWe) of electricity. 
(7) On August 4, 2020, a press report re-
vealed the alleged existence of a previously

undisclosed uranium yellowcake extraction 
facility in Saudi Arabia allegedly con-
structed with the assistance of the People’s 
Republic of China, which if confirmed, would 
indicate significant progress by Saudi Arabia 
in developing the early stages of the nuclear 
fuel cycle that precede uranium enrichment. 
(8) Saudi Arabia’s outdated Small Quan-
tities Protocol and its lack of an in-force Ad-
ditional Protocol to its International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Comprehensive Safe-
guards Agreement severely curtails IAEA in-
spections, which has led the Agency to call 
upon Saudi Arabia to either rescind or up-
date its Small Quantities Protocol. 
(b) MTCR TRANSFERS.—Not later than 30 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the President shall submit to the appro-
priate committees of Congress a written de-
termination, and any documentation to sup-
port that determination detailing— 
(1) whether any foreign person in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China knowingly exported, 
transferred, or engaged in trade of any item 
designated under Category I of the MTCR 
Annex to any foreign person in the previous 
three fiscal years; and 
(2) the sanctions the President has imposed 
or intends to impose pursuant to section 
11B(b) of the Export Administration Act of 
1979 (50 U.S.C. 4612(b)) against any foreign 
person who knowingly engaged in the export, 
transfer, or trade of that item or items. 
(c) THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA’S NU-
CLEAR FUEL CYCLE COOPERATION.—Not later 
than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a report 
detailing— 
(1) whether any foreign person in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China engaged in coopera-
tion with any other foreign person in the 
previous three fiscal years in the construc-
tion of any nuclear-related fuel cycle facility 
or activity that has not been notified to the 
IAEA and would be subject to complemen-
tary access if an Additional Protocol was in 
force; and 
(2) the policy options required to prevent 
and respond to any future effort by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to export to any for-
eign person an item classified as ‘‘plants for 
the separation of isotopes of uranium’’ or 
‘‘plants for the reprocessing of irradiated nu-
clear reactor fuel elements’’ under Part 110 
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ex-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2698 
May 18, 2021 
PART I—BUY AMERICA SOURCING 
REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 4111. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the United States must make signifi-
cant investments to install, upgrade, or re-
place the public works infrastructure of the 
United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the in-
frastructure of the United States, taxpayers 
expect that their public works infrastructure 
will be produced in the United States by 
American workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested 
in public infrastructure should not be used 
to reward companies that have moved their 
operations, investment dollars, and jobs to 
foreign countries or foreign factories, par-
ticularly those that do not share or openly 
flout the commitments of the United States 
to environmental, worker, and workplace 
safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed 
Federal assistance should give a common-
sense procurement preference for the mate-
rials and products produced by companies 
and workers in the United States in accord-
ance with the high ideals embodied in the en-
vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and 
other regulatory requirements of the United 
States; 
(5) common construction materials used in 
public works infrastructure projects, includ-
ing steel, iron, manufactured products, non- 
ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based 
products (including polyvinylchloride, com-
posite building materials, and polymers used 
in fiber optic cables), concrete and other ag-
gregates, glass (including optic glass), lum-
ber, and drywall are not adequately covered 
by a domestic content procurement pref-
erence, thus limiting the impact of taxpayer 
purchases to enhance supply chains in the 
United States; 
(6) the benefits of domestic content pro-
curement preferences extend beyond eco-
nomics; 
(7) by incentivizing domestic manufac-
turing, domestic content procurement pref-
erences reinvest tax dollars in companies 
and processes using the highest labor and en-
vironmental standards in the world; 
(8) strong domestic content procurement 
preference policies act to prevent shifts in 
production to countries that rely on produc-
tion practices that are significantly less en-
ergy efficient and far more polluting than 
those in the United States; 
(9) for over 75 years, Buy America and 
other domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws have been part of the United 
States procurement policy, ensuring that the 
United States can build and rebuild the in-
frastructure of the United States with high- 
quality American-made materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this 
Act, a domestic content procurement pref-
erence requirement may not apply, may 
apply only to a narrow scope of products and 
materials, or may be limited by waiver with 
respect to many infrastructure programs, 
which necessitates a review of such pro-
grams, including programs for roads, high-
ways, and bridges, public transportation, 
dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime fa-
cilities, intercity passenger and freight rail-
roads, freight and intermodal facilities, air-
ports, water systems, including drinking 
water and wastewater systems, electrical 
transmission facilities and systems, utili-
ties, broadband infrastructure, and buildings 
and real property; 
(11) Buy America laws create demand for 
domestically produced goods, helping to sus-
tain and grow domestic manufacturing and 
the millions of jobs domestic manufacturing 
supports throughout product supply chains; 
(12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
domestic content procurement preference 
policies apply to all Federal Government 
procurement and to various Federal-aid in-
frastructure programs; 
(13) a robust domestic manufacturing sec-
tor is a vital component of the national secu-
rity of the United States; 
(14) as more manufacturing operations of 
the United States have moved offshore, the 
strength and readiness of the defense indus-
trial base of the United States has been di-
minished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the inter-
national obligations of the United States; 
and 
(B) together with the government procure-
ments to which the laws apply, are impor-
tant levers for ensuring that United States 
manufacturers can access the government 
procurement markets of the trading partners 
of the United States.

of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or man-
ufactured goods.

conducting the assessment under subpara-
graph (A) shall consult with the Inter-

strong and consistent demand signal from 
the Federal Government providing the nec-
essary certainty to expand production capac-
ity investment in the United States.

vestment in the United States and the re- 
shoring of manufacturing, long-term con-
tracts must be no shorter than three years in 
duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United 
States should seek to ensure compliance 
with its international obligations, such as 
its commitments under the World Trade Or-
ganization’s Agreement on Government Pro-
curement and its free trade agreements, in-
cluding by invoking any relevant exceptions 
to those agreements, especially those related 
to national security and public health. 
(7) The United States needs a long-term in-
vestment strategy for the domestic produc-
tion of PPE items critical to the United 
States national response to a public health 
crisis, including the COVID–19 pandemic.

enforcement investigations have consist-
ently been impeded by an inability to reli-
ably and promptly obtain information iden-
tifying the persons that ultimately own cor-
porations, limited liability companies, or 
other similar entities suspected of engaging 
in illicit activity, as documented in reports 
and testimony by officials from the Depart-
ment of Justice, the Department of Home-
land Security, the Department of the Treas-
ury, the Government Accountability Office, 
and other agencies. 
(5) In the National Strategy for Combating 
Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, issued 
in 2020, the Department of the Treasury 
found the following: ‘‘Misuse of legal entities 
to hide a criminal beneficial owner or illegal 
source of funds continues to be a common, if 
not the dominant, feature of illicit finance 
schemes, especially those involving money 
laundering, predicate offences, tax evasion, 
and proliferation financing.’’. 
(6) Federal legislation, including the Anti- 
Money Laundering Act of 2020 (division F of 
Public Law 116–283) and the Corporate Trans-
parency Act (title LXIV of division F of Pub-
lic Law 116–283), combating the crime of 
money laundering and providing for the col-
lection of beneficial ownership information 
by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Net-
work of the Department of the Treasury (re-
ferred to in this section as ‘‘FinCEN’’) with 
respect to corporations, limited liability 
companies, or other similar entities formed 
under the laws of the States has recently 
been enacted to— 
(A) set a clear Federal standard for incor-
poration practices; 
(B) better enable critical national security, 
intelligence, and law enforcement efforts to 
identify and counter money laundering, the 
financing of terrorism, and other illicit ac-
tivity; and 
(C) bring the United States into compli-
ance with international standards with re-
spect to anti-money laundering and coun-
tering the financing of terrorism. 
(7) Providing beneficial ownership informa-
tion to FinCEN is especially important in 
cases in which foreign firms, including those 
in the People’s Republic of China or subject 
to the jurisdiction of the People’s Republic 
of China, seek to acquire United States firms 
and the valuable intellectual property of 
those firms in a manner that poses a threat 
to the national security of the United 
States. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury 
should implement the Anti-Money Laun-
dering Act of 2020 (division F of Public Law 
116–283), including the Corporate Trans-
parency Act (title LXIV of division F of Pub-
lic Law 116–283), within the timelines re-
quired under those Acts, including the ele-
ments of those Acts designed to enhance the 
ability of financial services providers to 
adopt and implement anti-money laundering 
best practices, mitigate burdens on small 
businesses, ensure the security of beneficial 
ownership information as provided for by 
those Acts, and address specific concerns re-
lating to abuses of anonymous shell compa-
nies by Chinese entities and the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China.

dents of the United States from such entities 
that sequence, analyze, collect, or store 
human genomic information and which the 
Director of National Intelligence or the head 
of another Federal department or agency 
reasonably anticipates may use such infor-
mation in a manner inconsistent with the 
national security interests of the United 
States; 
(B) whether the Department or recipient of 
such funds from the Department sought to 
provide funding to, or to use, domestic enti-
ties with no such ties to the country or coun-
tries of concern for such purposes and any 
barriers to the use of domestic entities; and 
(C) whether data use agreements, data se-
curity measures, and other such measures 
taken by the Department or recipient of 
such funds from the Department are suffi-
cient to protect the identifiable, sensitive in-
formation of the people of the United States 
and the national security interests of the 
United States; and 
(2) make recommendations to address any 
vulnerabilities to the United States national 
security identified, as appropriate. 
(c) ESTIMATION.—In conducting the study 
under this section, the Comptroller General 
may, as appropriate and necessary to com-
plete such study, investigate specific in-
stances of such utilization of genetic se-
quencing services or genetic services, as de-
scribed in subsection (a), to produce esti-
mates of the potential prevalence of such 
utilization among entities in receipt of De-
partmental funds.

‘‘(b)(1) It shall be the duty of the Secretary

appropriated to the fund. 
‘‘(2) Subject to paragraph (3), investments 
of amounts appropriated to the fund shall be 
made in public debt securities of the United 
States with maturities suitable to the fund. 
For such purpose, such obligations may be 
acquired— 
‘‘(A) on original issue at the issue price; or 
‘‘(B) by purchase of outstanding obliga-
tions at the market price. The purposes for 
which obligations of the United States may 
be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United 
States Code, are hereby extended to author-
ize the issuance at par of special obligations 
exclusively to the fund. Such special obliga-
tions shall bear interest at a rate equal to 
the average rate of interest, computed as to 
the end of the calendar month next pre-
ceding the date of such issue, borne by all 
marketable interest-bearing obligations of 
the United States then forming a part of the 
public debt, except that where such average 
rate is not a multiple of 1⁄8 of 1 percent, the 
rate of interest of such special obligations 
shall be the multiple of 1⁄8 of 1 percent next 
lower than such average rate. Such special 
obligations shall be issued only if the Sec-
retary determines that the purchases of 
other interest-bearing obligations of the 
United States, or of obligations guaranteed 
as to both principal and interest by the 
United States or original issue or at the 
market price, is not in the public interest.

Notwithstanding 
paragraph 
(2), 
upon receiving a determination of the Board 
described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary 
shall invest up to 40 percent of the fund’s as-
sets in securities other than public debt se-
curities of the United States, provided that 
the securities are traded in established 
United States markets. 
‘‘(B) A determination described in this sub-
paragraph is a determination by the Board 
that investments as described in subpara-
graph (A) are necessary to enable the Foun-
dation to carry out the purposes of this title 
without any diminution of the number of fel-
lowships provided under section 804. 
‘‘(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be 
construed to limit the authority of the 
Board to increase the number of fellowships 
provided under section 804, or to increase the 
amount of the fellowship authorized by sec-
tion 809, as the Board considers appropriate 
and is otherwise consistent with the require-
ments of this title.’’.

sion, or commonwealth of the United States. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Recent research has demonstrated 
that— 
(A) new businesses (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘startups’’)— 
(i) are disproportionately responsible for 
the innovations that drive economic growth; 
and 
(ii) account for virtually all net new job 
creation; 
(B) the rate of formation of United States 
businesses has fallen significantly in recent 
years; and 
(C) as determined by widely cited research, 
the decline in the rate described in subpara-
graph (B) is occurring in all 50 States, in all 
but a handful of 360 metro areas examined, 
and across a broad range of industry sectors. 
(2) Before policymakers can identify ways 
in which the decline in the rate described in 
paragraph (1)(B) may be counteracted, the 
underlying causes of the decline must be 
identified. 
(3) Economists have identified several fac-
tors that may explain the decline in the rate 
described in paragraph (1)(B), including— 
(A) demographic changes caused by an 
aging workforce and slowing population 
growth; 
(B) increased industry concentration that 
may make it more difficult for new market 
entrants to compete with established compa-
nies; 
(C) increased risk-aversion following the fi-
nancial crisis and recession that occurred in 
2008 and 2009 and deterioration of household 
balance sheets; 
(D) difficulties relating to access to cap-
ital, particularly difficulties encountered by 
underserved populations, women, and mem-
bers of minority groups; 
(E) the concentration of venture capital in 
only a few cities; 
(F) record levels of student debt; and 
(G) inefficiencies or other difficulties relat-
ing to the commercialization of federally 
funded research and innovation. 
(c) ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS.— 
(1) ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS REQUIRED.— 
Not later than 2 years after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Bureau of 
the Census and the Director of the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis of the Department of 
Commerce, shall conduct an assessment and 
analysis regarding the reasons for the state 
of the formation of new United States busi-
nesses during a period— 
(A) that the Secretary determines appro-
priate based on the data described in para-
graph (2)(A)(i); and 
(B) ending on the date on which the assess-
ment and analysis is conducted. 
(2) CONSIDERATIONS AND CONSULTATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—In conducting the assess-
ment and analysis required under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary shall— 
(i) notwithstanding any other provision of

Reserve System; and 
(VII) any other Federal or State agency, or 
public or private sector organization, that 
the Secretary determines appropriate; 
(ii) with respect to the formation of new 
United States businesses, consider the im-
pact of— 
(I) demographic changes caused by an 
aging workforce and slowing population 
growth; 
(II) increased industry concentration and 
whether such concentration may make it 
more difficult for new market entrants to 
compete with established companies; 
(III) increased risk-aversion following the 
financial crisis and recession that occurred 
in 2008 and 2009 and deterioration of house-
hold balance sheets; 
(IV) difficulties relating to access to cap-
ital, particularly difficulties encountered by 
underserved populations, women, and mem-
bers of minority groups; 
(V) the concentration of venture capital in 
only a few cities; 
(VI) record levels of student debt; 
(VII) inefficiencies or other difficulties re-
lating to the commercialization of federally 
funded research and innovation; 
(VIII) the use of federally funded research 
and innovation in the commercial market; 
(IX) regulatory burden, overlap, com-
plexity, and uncertainty at the Federal and 
State levels; 
(X) aspects of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 that penalize, obstruct, or otherwise dis-
advantage new businesses, or investors in 
new businesses, relative to incumbent busi-
nesses, or investors in incumbent businesses, 
respectively; 
(XI) foreign-born entrepreneurs and the 
impact of those entrepreneurs on job cre-
ation; and

CRITICAL 
MINERALS 
SUPPLY 
CHAINS AND RELIABILITY. 
(a) DEFINITION
OF CRITICAL MINERAL.—In 
this section, the term ‘‘critical mineral’’ has 
the meaning given the term in section 7002(a) 
of the Energy Act of 2020 (30 U.S.C. 1606(a)). 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) critical minerals are fundamental to 
the economy, competitiveness, and security 
of the United States; 
(2) many critical minerals are only eco-
nomic to recover when combined with the 
production of a host mineral; 
(3) to the maximum extent practicable, the 
critical mineral needs of the United States 
should be satisfied by minerals responsibly 
produced and recycled in the United States; 
and 
(4) the Federal permitting process has been 
identified as an impediment to mineral pro-
duction and the mineral security of the 
United States. 
(c) FEDERAL PERMITTING AND REVIEW PER-
FORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS.—To improve the 
quality and timeliness of Federal permitting 
and review processes with respect to critical 
mineral production on Federal land, the Sec-
retary of the Interior, acting through the Di-
rector of the Bureau of Land Management, 
and the Secretary of Agriculture, acting 
through the Chief of the Forest Service (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘Secre-
taries’’), to the maximum extent practicable, 
shall complete the Federal permitting and 
review processes with maximum efficiency 
and effectiveness, while supporting vital eco-
nomic growth, by— 
(1) establishing and adhering to timelines 
and schedules for the consideration of, and 
final decisions regarding, applications, oper-
ating plans, leases, licenses, permits, and 
other use authorizations for critical mineral- 
related activities on Federal land; 
(2) establishing clear, quantifiable, and 
temporal permitting performance goals and 
tracking progress against those goals; 
(3) engaging in early collaboration among 
agencies, project sponsors, and affected 
stakeholders— 
(A) to incorporate and address the inter-
ests of those parties; and 
(B) to minimize delays; 
(4) ensuring transparency and account-
ability by using cost-effective information 
technology to collect and disseminate infor-
mation regarding individual projects and 
agency performance; 
(5) engaging in early and active consulta-
tion with State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments— 
(A) to avoid conflicts or duplication of ef-
fort; 
(B) to resolve concerns; and 
(C) to allow for concurrent, rather than se-
quential, reviews; 
(6) providing demonstrable improvements 
in the performance of Federal permitting 
and review processes, including lower costs 
and more timely decisions; 
(7) expanding and institutionalizing Fed-
eral permitting and review process improve-
ments that have proven effective; 
(8) developing mechanisms to better com-
municate priorities and resolve disputes 
among agencies at the national, regional, 
State, and local levels; and 
(9) developing other practices, such as 
preapplication procedures. 
(d) REVIEW AND REPORT.—Not later than 1 
year after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretaries shall submit to Congress a 
report that— 
(1) identifies additional measures, includ-
ing regulatory and legislative proposals, if 
appropriate, that would increase the timeli-
ness of permitting activities for the explo-
ration and development of domestic critical 
minerals; 
(2) identifies options, including cost recov-
ery paid by permit applicants, for ensuring 
adequate staffing and training of Federal en-
tities and personnel responsible for the con-
sideration of applications, operating plans, 
leases, licenses, permits, and other use au-
thorizations for critical mineral-related ac-
tivities on Federal land; 
(3) quantifies the period of time typically 
required to complete each step associated 
with the development and processing of ap-
plications, operating plans, leases, licenses, 
permits, and other use authorizations for 
critical mineral-related activities on Federal 
land, including by— 
(A) calculating the range, the mean, the 
median, the variance, and other statistical 
measures or representations of the period of 
time; and 
(B) taking into account other aspects that 
affect the period of time that are outside the 
control of the Executive branch, such as ju-
dicial review, applicant decisions, or State 
and local government involvement; and 
(4) describes actions carried out pursuant 
to subsection (c). 
(e) PERFORMANCE METRIC.—Not later than 
90 days after the date of submission of the 
report under subsection (d), and after pro-
viding public notice and an opportunity to 
comment, the Secretaries, using as a base-
line the period of time quantified under 
paragraph (3) of that subsection, shall de-
velop and publish a performance metric for 
evaluating the progress made by the Execu-
tive branch to expedite the permitting of ac-
tivities that will increase exploration for, 
and development of, domestic critical min-
erals, 
while 
maintaining 
environmental 
standards. 
(f) ANNUAL REPORTS.—Not later than the 
date on which the President submits the 
first budget of the President under section 
1105 of title 31, United States Code, after 
publication of the performance metric re-
quired under subsection (e), and annually 
thereafter, the Secretaries shall submit to 
Congress a report that— 
(1) summarizes the implementation of rec-
ommendations, measures, and options identi-
fied in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 
(d); 
(2) using the performance metric developed 
under subsection (e), describes progress made 
by the Executive branch, as compared to the 
baseline developed pursuant to subsection 
(d)(3), in expediting the permitting of activi-
ties that will increase exploration for, and 
development of, domestic critical minerals; 
and 
(3) compares the United States to other 
countries in terms of permitting efficiency 
and any other criteria relevant to the glob-
ally competitive critical minerals industry. 
(g) 
INDIVIDUAL
PROJECTS.—Each 
year, 
using data contained in the reports sub-
mitted under subsection (f), the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget shall 
prioritize inclusion of individual critical 
mineral projects on the website operated by 
the Office of Management and Budget in ac-
cordance with section 1122 of title 31, United 
States Code.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2862 
CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT SUICIDE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2862, the ‘‘Campaign 
to Prevent Suicide Act,’’ which creates an edu-
cational campaign recommended by suicide 
prevention advocates and the Federal Com-
munications 
Commission 
(FCC) 
to 
raise 
awareness for a three-digit suicide lifeline 
phone number, suicide prevention resources, 
and more effective discourse on how to pre-
vent suicide. 
This bipartisan legislation is designed to 
help change the culture around suicide so that 
all Americans know to engage rather than ig-
nore individuals who might be experiencing 
suicidal thoughts, and it would: 
Fund campaigns to share information about 
suicide prevention resources like the suicide 
prevention lifeline, which has been shown to 
save lives; and 
Create new media tools to help television 
and social media know how to shape the na-
tional conversation we need to reduce suicide. 
America and Texas face a suicide crisis, 
and we must come together to fight this tragic 
epidemic. 
Each day in Texas there are more than 6 
suicide deaths and nearly 30 hospitalizations 
for attempted suicide. 
Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death 
for Texans and the third leading cause of 
death among youth ages 15 to 24. 
60 percent of Texas suicide deaths occur 
among people 25 to 64 years of age. 
Rates of suicide among Whites increased 
12 percent since 2000, particularly among fe-
males; rates among Blacks and Hispanics 
have remained stable during the same time. 
Estimated medical costs of Texas hos-
pitalizations for suicide attempts average 
$8,849 per patient, or more than $95.6 million 
annually. 
We need to start talking about suicide, and 
we need to keep talking. 
For this reason, in 2019, I convened a panel 
to discuss mental health and suicide and an 
all-youth panel to account for how students 
handle their mental health and what policies 
they want to see come from Congress. 
It was a beautiful and absolutely necessary 
convening of young people. 
They shared with us and tasked us with the 
solutions and measures they know will posi-
tively impact their communities and their gen-
eration. 
One problem was raised time and time 
again during the course of this panel: There 
are far too few resources available to our 
young people, especially our young people of 
color, to truly support the staggering preva-
lence of mental health ailments and effectively 
combat the growing number of youth suicide. 
Matthew 21:16 says: from the mouths of ba-
bies shall come praise, and on that day from 
the mouths of babies came solutions: 
Fund transportation infrastructure in the very 
communities you scrutinize for gang violence, 
help the children get home safely. 
Create and support more after school pro-
grams and activities. 
Provide students with mentors and exam-
ples of a life alternative to the poverty and vio-
lence that many of us are facing. 
Support mental health experts and trauma 
experts of color, who are specifically trained to 
deal with the unique trauma they face. 
I listened to young people share the heart- 
wrenching truths of encounters with gun vio-
lence, the broken juvenile justice system, and 
improperly 
trained 
mental 
health 
profes-
sionals—if they are afforded the opportunity to 
be in proximity to these professionals at all. 
Suicide prevention starts with recognizing 
the warning signs of suicide and taking them 
seriously, and talking openly about suicidal 
thoughts and feelings can save lives. 
Although suicide has long been a serious 
public health problem, the recent and sudden 
isolation, 
unemployment 
and 
precipitous 
change ushered in by COVID–19 threatens to 
increase the incidence of people for whom sui-
cide seems the only viable solution. 
By looking out for one another, matching 
people with the help they need, and helping 
those who are hurting feel more connected, 
people who are contemplating suicide have an 
opportunity to recover and live lives of mean-
ing and purpose. 
For this reason, I ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote in support of 
H.R. 2862.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER BOB 
WEIMER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Bob 
Weimer for his 21 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Weimer has worked throughout 
his career to serve the people of Somerset 
County. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I thank him for his work 
to protect life and property in our community 
and wish him continued health, safety, and 
success.

IN RECOGNITION OF QURISTIN 
WALKER 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Quristin Walker for her service in 
my office in Washington, D.C. 
Quristin joined our team as a staff assistant 
on my very first day in office in January of 
2019. She was one of just three original staff 
members charged with setting up a Congres-
sional office, a task which those who have 
done know is not for the faint of heart. Quristin 
played an integral role in setting up systems 
and ensuring every constituent, whether by 
walk-in, call, or tour request, was responded 
to in a timely, courteous manner that was de-
monstrative of my commitment of service to 
the people of the 14th Congressional District 
of Illinois. She went above-and-beyond in her 
role as intern coordinator, often giving life ad-
vice to young people with hearts for service 
that extended far past the walls of my office. 
She was a listening ear and source of support 
through moves, graduations, next career 
steps, and more, as an accessible mentor to 
so many who came through our internship 
program. 
Quristin’s respect for all who entered or 
called the office, cheery demeanor, and fre-
quent pick-me-up treats and Beyonce music 
for the team proved to be invaluable assets 
that kept our team smiling through all the joys 
and challenges of our work the past two-and- 
a-half years. Although Quristin may be leaving 
our office, our community in northern Illinois 
and my entire staff will always consider her 
Team Underwood. 
Prior to joining my staff, Quristin earned a 
Bachelor’s degree from Northern Illinois Uni-
versity and she currently is pursuing a Mas-
ter’s degree from American University. She is 
a proud alumna of the Congressional Black 
Caucus Foundation Fellowship Program. Our 
office will miss her. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally 
thank Quristin Walker for her service to my of-
fice, to Illinois’s 14th Congressional District, 
and to our country.

lead the world in science and innovation. We 
need a STEM workforce that is equipped with 
the knowledge and skills to meet the needs of 
today’s industries and make breakthrough dis-
coveries that will launch future industries. We 
are having a spirited debate in Congress 
about how best to position ourselves to main-
tain our leadership position in science and in-
novation, especially with respect to China. In 
debating how much we invest, at what agen-
cy, and in what form, we cannot lose sight of 
a key advantage of ours—our diversity. 
Research provides compelling evidence that 
diversity unlocks innovation, yet we have 
failed to fully leverage the diverse talent avail-
able to us. Of particular concern is the under-
representation of women and minority re-
searchers in STEM faculty positions. Accord-
ing to the National Science Foundation’s re-
cently released report entitled, Women, Minori-
ties, and Persons with Disabilities in Science 
and Engineering, women hold only 25 percent 
of full professor positions in STEM. The num-
bers are even more striking for faculty in racial 
and ethnic minority groups. Black STEM fac-
ulty represent only 2.5 percent of full profes-
sors across all science disciplines, while only 
4.6 percent of full professors are Hispanic. In 
some fields, the disparity is particularly stark. 
Women make up only 19 percent of full pro-
fessors in computer science and 11 percent in 
engineering. The number of Black and His-
panic professors in computer science are so 
small, they cannot be reported without com-
promising their privacy. In engineering, 2.5 
percent of professors are Black and 4.3 per-
cent are Hispanic. 
This lack of diversity in the academic work-
force is holding us back. It is critical to ensure 
STEM faculty resemble the students they are 
teaching. When students see someone who 
looks like them in a career they want to pur-
sue, they are more likely to see it as an 
achievable goal. Diversity of perspectives also 
advances research and leads to new lines of 
inquiry. Without diverse STEM faculty, we can-
not grow the STEM workforce and advance 
the research and innovation we need to take 
on the pressing challenges ahead and to com-
pete around the world. 
The STEM Opportunities Act would em-
power Federal agencies and universities to 
identify and lower barriers to the recruitment, 
retention, and advancement of women, minori-
ties, and other groups underrepresented in 
STEM studies and careers. The bill promotes 
an evidence-driven approach to these chal-
lenges. It requires agencies to collect com-
prehensive demographic data on the grant re-
view process and on STEM faculty at U.S. 
universities. The bill supports research on par-
ticipation and career trajectories and the im-
plementation of best practices for increasing 
the recruitment and retention of minority stu-
dents and faculty. 
This bill also pushes Federal agencies to do 
more to ensure all researchers have a fair 
shot at receiving funding for their work. The 
Office of Science and Technology Policy 
(OSTP) is directed to develop consistent fed-
eral policies for recipients of federal research 
awards who have caregiving responsibilities. 
The bill also requires consistent federal guid-
ance to grant reviewers and program officers 
on best practices to minimize the effects of im-
plicit bias in the review of federal research 
grants. It requires OSTP to develop guidance 
for universities and Federal laboratories to aid 
them in identifying any cultural and institutional 
barriers limiting the recruitment, retention, and 
achievement of underrepresented groups in 
academic and government STEM research ca-
reers, and in developing and implementing 
current best practices for reducing such bar-
riers. 
I have been working on a version of this 
legislation for nearly 15 years. I thank Ranking 
Member LUCAS for joining me last Congress, 
and again this Congress, in making this a bi-
partisan bill. I also thank the 25 organizations 
and institutions that have endorsed this legis-
lation. 
After the year we have just gone through, it 
is undeniable that science, and scientists, are 
critical to ensuring we are poised to handle 
the challenges ahead. We must act now to en-
sure we have the STEM workforce we will 
need. The STEM Opportunities Act is an im-
portant step in that direction. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in both bodies to 
get this legislation over the finish line.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT 
SPENDING 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this time today to warn my fellow law-
makers that the passage of any infrastructure 
legislation must hold contractors and project 
sponsors who receive federal dollars account-
able for their performance or risk another 
round of failed government projects, financed 
or bailed out at taxpayers’ expense. 
Too often, ventures financed by the federal 
government have failed to be completed or 
simply never worked and, in the end, it’s the 
taxpayers who are typically the big losers. 
I will be working with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to make sure that language 
is included in any infrastructure legislation that 
ensures that previous projects utilizing major 
federal assistance, that have defaulted and 
gone bust, cannot be eligible to reapply and 
do the same thing again. 
The now-famous Solyndra solar energy 
project—the first major alternative energy in-
frastructure project launched by the Obama 
Administration as part of the American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act,—cost taxpayers 
over $500 million, but the solar panel manu-
facturer went bankrupt within a few years leav-
ing taxpayers on the hook for almost all of a 
$535 million loan guarantee. 
Later in the Obama Administration, in what 
can only be described as Solyndra 2.0, the 
Department of Energy committed $737 million 
to the development of the Crescent Dunes 
solar energy project in Nevada, also in the 
form of loan guarantees. That project still 
doesn’t produce electricity and taxpayers are 
out as much as $234 million of the out-
standing DOE loan balance if not more. This 
is after the project received an additional $275 
million in taxpayer money under Treasury’s 
Section 1603 program in 2017. 
Only in Washington, DC does this scenario 
make sense. It is crucial that any energy infra-
structure projects funded going forward, espe-
cially now that Congress is considering a 
much broader definition of infrastructure, 
should build in the kind of oversight and ac-
countability measures that will minimize the 
potential for more boondoggles. 
If we fail to do this, taxpayers will once 
again be left holding the bag and we will have 
failed to do our duty in terms of overseeing 
the programs we support while protecting tax-
payers.

COMBATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
IN SCIENCE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States has made great strides in re-
cruiting more women to study science and en-
gineering and pursue research careers. De-
spite this progress, women researchers re-
main underrepresented in many STEM fields, 
particularly in senior positions. For a long time, 
many assumed that as the number of women 
earning STEM degrees increased, the dis-
parity at the top would narrow. But that has 
not been the case. Unfortunately, we continue 
to lose talented women at every stage of their 
research careers. 
In 2018, the National Academies released a 
consensus 
report 
examining 
the 
con-
sequences of sexual harassment on the ca-
reers of women in STEM. The report found 
that sexual harassment is pervasive in the 
sciences and it is banning women’s careers 
and driving talented researchers out of the 
field altogether. The report committee found 
that policies currently in place, such as Title 
IX, are ineffective at protecting individual re-
searchers. The committee called on Federal

science agencies, universities, and scientific 
societies to transparently examine the work-
place climate, and to go beyond a culture of 
compliance by taking proactive steps to foster 
a safe and welcoming research environment. 
The Combating Sexual Harassment in 
Science Act addresses key recommendations 
in the Academies report. This legislation di-
rects the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy to issue uniform guidance to all Federal 
science agencies to implement reporting re-
quirements for all grantees. I commend the 
National Science Foundation, the National In-
stitutes of Health, and the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration for their 
leadership in establishing such reporting re-
quirements ahead of any mandate to do so. 
The bill also supports research to inform up-
dated policies in the future, it seeks to 
incentivize culture change at universities, pro-
vide training for researchers, and it makes 
clear that sexual harassment should be con-
sidered as important as research misconduct, 
as recommended by the National Academies. 
I want to thank Ranking Member LUCAS for 
his partnership in developing and introducing 
H.R. 2695. I also want to thank the 24 organi-
zations that endorsed the legislation and the 
universities that provided input. I recognize 
that many universities continue to have con-
cerns with some of the details even as they 
support the overall goals. I believe we arrived 
at a good compromise that protects the most 
vulnerable. I also believe some of the con-
cerns are based on a misreading of the legis-
lation. H.R. 2695 does not interfere with due 
process. It simply requires transparency while 
protecting privacy. 
While sexual harassment in science is not a 
problem that can be solved with legislation 
alone, H.R. 2695 helps ensure that the Fed-
eral science agencies are doing their part. No 
researcher should be forced to choose be-
tween her passion for science and her right to 
feel safe. I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in both bodies to send this legisla-
tion to the President’s desk.

PREVENTION 
LIFELINE 
IM-
PROVEMENT ACT OF 2021 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2981, the ‘‘Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021,’’ 
which bolsters aid for local suicide crisis cen-
ters. 
This bipartisan legislation fully funds over-
burdened crisis centers, so that they can meet 
rising call volumes, and takes steps to allevi-
ate call wait times and make support re-
sources available to friends and family of 
those in crisis. 
Specifically, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
Improvement Act: 
Significantly increases authorized funding 
for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; 
Requires HHS to develop and implement a 
plan to increase quality assurance, eliminate 
call wait times, implement evidence-based 
practices like follow-up, ensure resources are 
available to friends and family of those in cri-
sis, and create guidelines to carry out periodic 
testing of the Lifeline; 
Requires increased coordination and data 
sharing between the Suicide Prevention Life-
line and the CDC; 
Creates a pilot program to research and 
employ innovative technologies for suicide 
prevention; 
Requires a study and report to Congress 
from both HHS and GAO on the plan imple-
mented by HHS to reform the Lifeline as well 
as other recommendations for improvement to 
the Lifeline’s operations. 
America and Texas face a suicide crisis, 
and we must come together to fight this tragic 
epidemic. 
In Texas, crisis centers handle the majority 
of local calls to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
But in recent years, rising rates of suicide 
and limited funding for call centers have made 
it nearly impossible to consistently provide 
quality and timely support for Texans in need. 
Making matters worse, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has added constraints and elevated 
rates of mental illness. 
Each day in Texas there are more than 6 
suicide deaths and nearly 30 hospitalizations 
for attempted suicide. 
Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death 
for Texans and the third leading cause of 
death among youth ages 15 to 24. 
60 percent of Texas suicide deaths occur 
among people 25 to 64 years of age. 
Rates of suicide among Whites increased 
12 percent since 2000, particularly among fe-
males; rates among Blacks and Hispanics 
have remained stable during the same time. 
Estimated medical costs of Texas hos-
pitalizations for suicide attempts average 
$8,849 per patient, or more than $95.6 million 
annually. 
We need to start talking about suicide, and 
we need to keep talking. 
Suicide prevention starts with recognizing 
the warning signs of suicide and taking them 
seriously, and talking openly about suicidal 
thoughts and feelings can save lives. 
Although suicide has long been a serious 
public health problem, the recent and sudden 
isolation, 
unemployment 
and 
precipitous 
change ushered in by COVID–19 threatens to 
increase the incidence of people for whom sui-
cide seems the only viable solution. 
By looking out for one another, matching 
people with the help they need, and helping 
those who are hurting feel more connected, 
people who are contemplating suicide have an 
opportunity to recover and live lives of mean-
ing and purpose. 
For this reason, I ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote in support of 
H.R. 2981.

Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of the Honorable Otto Beatty, 
Jr., of Columbus, Ohio, who passed away May 
14, 2021 at the age of 81. 
Mr. Beatty, the husband to our distinguished 
colleague, Congresswoman JOYCE
BEATTY, 
was an attorney and former state lawmaker, a 
leading figure in the fight for racial equality in 
Ohio. The couple married in 1992. 
As a lawyer, Otto was able to successfully 
use his Columbus law firm to fight discrimina-
tion and fight for a more even playing field for 
Black and minority-owned businesses. 
A true public servant, Mr. Beatty was first 
elected to the Ohio House in 1979, spending 
the next 18 years advocating for the disadvan-
taged, as well as for health care access and 
tort reform, He also served as special counsel 
to the Ohio attorney general, counsel to what 
would become the Ohio Legislative Black Cau-
cus, and chair of the Ohio Commission on Mi-
nority Health. 
Mr. Beatty was born in Columbus and re-
ceived bachelor’s and master’s degrees from 
Howard University and a law degree from the 
Ohio 
State 
University. 
His 
grandmother, 
Mayme Moore, was a civil-rights activist who 
stood alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. and helped found the Columbus NAACP. 
Otto and his family have been trailblazers 
and strong advocates in many ways—true in-
spirations to us all. Besides his wife and my 
friend, Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY, Otto is 
survived by two children: daughter Laurel 
Beatty Blunt, a judge on the 10th District Court 
of Appeals, and son Otto III, a Columbus at-
torney. 
There is no doubt that Mr. Beatty was an 
absolute giant, a man deep with integrity and 
great business and political skills. I will re-
member him for his wonderful sense of humor 
and how much he adored JOYCE. I was very 
sad to hear of his passing and my prayers go 
out to the gentlelady, Mrs. BEATTY, and to all 
of Otto’s family and friends. He has left behind 
a tremendous legacy in Central Ohio and for 
the entire state.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER MARK 
OHLER, SR. 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Mark 
Ohler, Sr. for his 21 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Ohler has worked throughout his 
career to serve the people of Somerset Coun-
ty. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank him for his work to pro-
tect life and property in our community and 
wish him continued health, safety, and suc-

SUPPORTING EARLY-CAREER 
RESEARCHERS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has created enormous 
disruptions to the scientific enterprise. The 
Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology held two hearings to explore the chal-
lenges and learn what is needed to help the 
scientific community recover. Researchers and 
their students were kept away from the lab, 
significantly slowing progress on the research 
and limiting opportunities for mentoring. Re-
search facilities were shuttered and con-
ferences cancelled. Travel restrictions resulted 
in missed field campaigns and kept inter-
national students from joining their research 
groups on campus. These setbacks affected 
researchers and students across all scientific 
disciplines. Women and historically underrep-
resented groups were particularly affected. 
While the full cost of the pandemic in terms of 
lost research is not yet known, the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) esti-
mates that NIH alone lost $16 billion of re-
search and the Director of the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) put the figure at $3 
billion for NSF-funded research. 
I am deeply concerned that these disrup-
tions will have long-lasting consequences for 
the research ecosystem. One of the most ur-
gent challenges we face is the potentially irre-
versible loss of research talent. The financial 
pressures of the pandemic forced many uni-
versities to institute hiring freezes for faculty 
positions. The STEM faculty job market con-
tracted as much as 70 percent in 2020. Early 
career researchers are the most vulnerable to 
this contraction, even if it is not permanent. 
Too many are currently in limbo. After years of 
hard work and an enormous investment of re-
sources to train these scholars, we simply 
cannot afford to let them slip through the 
cracks. If we are to keep ahead of our global 
competitors and ensure our security and pros-
perity, we must act now to mitigate a loss of 
human capital that would take decades to re-
coup. 
The Supporting Early-Career Researchers 
Act provides a bridge to help recent Ph.D. 
graduates stay on their chosen career path as 
they weather this turbulent period. The legisla-
tion establishes a two-year, $250 million agen-
cy-wide early career fellowship pilot program 
at NSF. This will enable two cohorts of 1,600 
fellows working in all STEM disciplines to 
carry out their research at the U.S. institutions 
of their choosing. 
More than 30 organizations have endorsed 
H.R. 144. I want to thank Ranking Member 
LUCAS for joining me in introducing this bill and 
bringing it to the House Floor. I look forward 
to working with my colleagues in both bodies 
to see it enacted and funded quickly.

FOR 
VET-
ERANS THERAPY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1448, the ‘‘PAWS for 
Veterans Therapy Act,’’ which is bipartisan 
legislation that directs the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs to carry out a pilot program on 
dog training therapy, and to amend title 38 of 
the United States Code to authorize the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to provide service 
dogs to veterans with mental illnesses who do 
not have mobility impairments. 
This legislation will reduce veteran suicide 
connected to mental health conditions by 
partnering veterans experiencing symptoms of 
PTSD and other post-deployment issues with 
service dogs through a Department of Vet-
erans Affairs pilot program. 
Dog therapy programs have a track record 
of reducing symptoms associated with PTSD, 
and through this pilot program, veterans are 
expected to experience an improved quality of 
life and ability to reenter society as well as in-
creased chances of survival. 
Many 
veterans 
have 
had 
their 
lives 
changed—in some cases, saved—by service 
dogs, and this bill would expand this treatment 
by launching a pilot program to make veterans 
with mental health issues such as depression 
eligible to receive service dogs. 
According to a report from the Department 
of Veteran Affairs: 
the number of veterans with mental health 
conditions such as post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD) and substance use disorders in-
creased from 27 percent in 2001 to more than 
40 percent in 2014, and an average of 20 vet-
erans per day died by suicide in 2014; 
11 to 20 out of every 100 veterans (or be-
tween 11 and 20 percent) who served in oper-
ations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom 
have PTSD in a given year; 
12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans (or 
12 percent) have PTSD in a given year; and 
An average of 20 veterans a day die by sui-
cide. 
PTSD symptoms can include crippling anx-
iety, emotional control issues, fear of public 
spaces, drug abuse, and most tragically, sui-
cide. 
A recent study led by the Purdue University 
College of Veterinary Medicine, found that vet-
erans with service dogs produce more cortisol, 
a biomarker used as a metric of the effects of 
chronic and acute stress, than military vet-
erans without a service dog in the home. 
Moreover, veterans with service dogs re-
ported having lower levels of anxiety, anger, 
sleep disturbances, and less alcohol abuse 
compared to veterans without service dogs. 
We must do everything possible to combat 
veteran suicide, including innovative treat-
ments like service dog therapy that address 
post-deployment mental health conditions. 
Our veterans deserve every tool in the tool-
box when it comes to their mental health, 
which is why I’m proud that this legislation en-
courages dog training therapy for veterans. 
Congress can, and must, give veterans the 
opportunity to utilize the treatments that work 
best for them.

IN RECOGNITION OF LANDON 
BAILEY 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Landon Bailey for his service in 
my office in Washington, D.C. 
Landon joined our office as scheduler at the 
beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. As our 
office transitioned to maximum telework status 
in March 2020 and we learned to serve Illinois’ 
14th District remotely, Landon played an inte-
gral role. He enthusiastically rolled up his 
sleeves and demonstrated patience, persever-
ance, and dedication to learning a new job, in-
tegrating with a new team, and serving the 
people of the 14th District of Illinois, all without 
the benefit of ever working in a physical office 
environment or meeting his colleagues face- 
to-face. While taking on that particular chal-
lenge is an experience shared by more than a 
few Americans during the coronavirus pan-
demic, the grace, humor, and kindness with 
which he approached the challenge sets him 
apart. 
During his tenure, Landon shifted our exter-
nal and internal scheduling processes from a 
primarily in-person operation to a primarily vir-
tual operation. He learned and taught others 
how to Zoom, use Teams, and participate in 
hearings via WebEx—and often navigate mul-
tiple virtual events simultaneously. He liaised 
with hundreds of constituents and made sure 
each of them was able to connect with our of-
fice. Without his efforts, our District would not 
have been as well-served during this chal-
lenging time. 
Landon’s collegiality, get-it-done attitude, 
and grace under pressure were invaluable as-
sets as we worked to keep our community 
safe, healthy, and informed in this unprece-
dented year. 
Prior to joining my staff, Landon earned a 
Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from 
Delaware State University, where he was a 
member of Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. and 
The Men of Color Alliance. He is currently pur-
suing a Master’s degree in Public Administra-
tion from Wilmington University. I am grateful 
he chose to continue his career in public serv-
ice by joining my office. Our office will miss his 
daily updates on our morning calls, his unfail-
ing love for Delaware State University, and his 
ability to narrate an impromptu team-building 
holiday fashion show like a pro. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally 
thank Landon Bailey for his service to my of-
fice, to Illinois’s 14th Congressional District, 
and to our country.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF DR. DEBRA A. DRAPER 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to honor the service of Dr. Debra A. 
Draper, a Director of Health Care at the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office (GAO), on 
the occasion of her upcoming retirement. Dr. 
Draper spent 14 years of her career at GAO, 
primarily overseeing evaluations of federal 
health care services for veterans and military 
servicemembers. Dr. Draper brought with her 
to GAO more than 25 years of experience in 
health care administration, health services re-
search, and health care consulting, as well as 
a Ph.D. in Health Services Organization and 
Research. 
As she retires, Dr. Draper will leave a last-
ing legacy—not only at GAO, but at the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and here 
in Congress. As Chairman of the House Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, I am especially 
grateful for the work Dr. Draper and her teams 
have done for this committee. As a Director at 
GAO, Dr. Draper has issued at least 80 writ-
ten products, more than 45 of which were re-
ports or written testimony prepared at the re-
quest or mandate of the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. Dr. Draper and her teams 
have made hundreds of recommendations to 
improve the delivery of health care services to 
our nation’s veterans, the majority of which 
have been implemented. 
Since 2010, Dr. Draper has testified at 12 
hearings convened by the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs or its Subcommittees. She 
has been a trusted voice and provided mean-
ingful insights on numerous issues within the 
Committee’s jurisdiction. However, Dr. Drap-
er’s most significant contributions as a hearing 
witness have been on the topic of veterans’ 
wait times for appointments at VA medical fa-
cilities, an issue that captured nationwide 
media attention in 2014. Dr. Draper’s testi-
mony and subsequent reports on this topic 
has been invaluable to helping the Committee 
understand VA’s appointment scheduling proc-
esses and the lack of transparency in VA’s re-
ported wait times. Dr. Draper’s body of work 
will continue to guide the Committee’s over-
sight in this area, even after her retirement. 
In 2015, GAO added VA health care to its 
biennial High Risk List, which focuses atten-
tion on federal programs and government op-
erations that are most vulnerable to waste, 
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. In desig-
nating VA health care as a high-risk area, 
GAO identified five areas of concern: (1) am-
biguous policies and inconsistent processes; 
(2) inadequate oversight and accountability; 
(3) information technology challenges; (4) in-
adequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear 
resource needs and allocation priorities. Since 
2015, amid significant leadership instability at 
VA, Dr. Draper has diligently monitored the 
Department’s response to GAO’s high-risk 
designation, engaging in countless meetings 
with VA officials and providing ongoing feed-
back on the Department’s plans for addressing 
GAO’s five areas of concern. While VA still 
has a significant amount of work to do to meet 
GAO’s criteria for removal from the High Risk 
List, Dr. Draper has established a solid foun-
dation for evaluating VA’s future progress. 
Please join me in thanking Dr. Draper for 
her many years of dedicated GAO service, 
which will have a lasting impact on veterans, 
VA, and the Congress. Throughout her time at 
GAO, she has been a highly respected leader, 
supervisor, mentor, and colleague, and she 
will undoubtedly be missed by those who have 
worked closely with her. My House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs colleagues and I, and our 
staffs, congratulate her and wish her well in 
her richly deserved retirement.

H.R. 210, RURAL STEM EDUCATION 
RESEARCH ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I was proud to join Ranking Member Lucas in 
introducing his Rural STEM Education Re-
search Act. Access to high-quality STEM edu-
cation has too long been place-based. For stu-
dents who grow up in rural areas of this coun-
try, even in states that boast some of the 
world’s best research universities, a STEM ca-
reer may seem unattainable. Many rural stu-
dents have never met a practicing scientist or 
engineer. Their teachers often struggle with 
limited resources for the STEM curriculum. It 
is unlikely that their schools have well 
equipped science laboratories that may pro-
vide hands-on experiences that are known to 
inspire scientific curiosity and a love of STEM 
at an early age. The nearest science museum 
may be too far for a field trip, if the district can 
even afford to transport them. And broadband 
access remains an urgent challenge. 
Yet we know with certainty that talent for 
science has nothing to do with one where is 
born, any more than it has to do with the color 
of one’s skin or one’s gender. Our country is 
filled with smart young people from all back-
grounds who may one day contribute to our 
science and innovation leadership. In fact, we 
need them to contribute to our science and in-
novation future if we are to continue to com-
pete on the global stage and develop solutions 
to our most pressing challenges. But these 
young people must first see it as a possibility 
for themselves, and that starts with access to 
high-quality STEM education and hands-on re-
search experiences in their local schools. 
The Rural STEM Education Act provides for 
research and development to increase access 
to STEM education opportunities in rural 
schools and to provide teachers with the re-
sources they need to teach more effectively. 
The bill also directs the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop 
a prize competition to advance research and 
development of creative technologies for ex-
panded broadband access. This bill further 
provides for assessments of Federal invest-
ments in rural STEM education to be con-
ducted by the National Academies and the 
Government Accountability Office. 
H.R. 210 is a good, bipartisan bill. I am 
pleased that the House passed it today along 
with a series of other bills focused on growing, 
diversifying, and strengthening our STEM 
workforce for the future. I look forward to 
working with Ranking Member Lucas and col-
leagues in both bodies to enact all of these 
bills.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

NATIVE AMERICAN CHILD 
PROTECTION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1688, the ‘‘Native 
American Child Protection Act,’’ (‘‘NACPA’’) 
which authorizes three programs aimed at en-
suring that Tribes have the tools they need to 
treat, prevent, investigate, and prosecute in-
stances of family violence, child abuse, and 
child neglect involving Native American chil-
dren and families. 
The original version of these programs 
passed as part of then-Senator John McCain’s 
Indian Child Protection and Family Violence 
Prevention Act, but the programs were never 
fully funded and have not been reauthorized 
by Congress. 
This legislation would do the following: 
Establish a new National Indian Resource 
Services Center to provide tribes with tech-
nical assistance, advice, and training on ad-
dressing child abuse, family violence, and 
child neglect. 
Support efforts to improve intergovernmental 
coordination between federal and tribal per-
sonnel responding to those issues. 
Authorize grants through the Indian Child 
Abuse Treatment Grant Program to establish 
treatment programs and culturally appropriate 
services for the victims of child abuse and ne-
glect in Indian Country. 
Authorize formula grants to Tribes under the 
Indian Child Protection and Family Violence 
Prevention Program to support the hiring of 
caseworkers and the establishment and ex-
pansion of tribal programs that investigate, 
prosecute, and prevent incidents of child 
abuse, child neglect, and family violence in In-
dian Country. 
American Indian and Alaska Native children 
and their families who experience child mal-
treatment or family violence often have few 
opportunities to find accessible, culturally-ap-
propriate services to help them address the 
trauma from these events. 
Furthermore, prevention funding is almost 
non-existent for this population, removing op-
portunities to prevent trauma— before it hap-
pens and avoid families and children slipping 
into crisis. 
The federal government has a solemn re-
sponsibility to ensure that the most vulnerable 
members of Indigenous communities—chil-
dren—are protected. 
Guarding against crimes committed against 
our Native communities will always be one of 
my highest priorities, and this bill is a strong 
step in the right direction. 
Native communities must have the support 
and resources necessary to help children 
learn, grow, and live healthy lives. 
In Texas and across the country, too many 
Indigenous children have been victims of vio-
lence, abuse, and neglect. 
The Federal government has an urgent re-
sponsibility to these children, and we should 
be doing all that we can to help them secure 
a bright future. 
This legislation fulfills a promise made years 
ago to address the impact of abuse of Native 
children in federally-run boarding schools and 
prevent anything like it from ever happening 
again. 
This promise was never fulfilled because 
these programs were never funded, and the 
Tribes never received the support they need-
ed. 
This is why we must pass this bill: to finally 
uphold our responsibility to help Tribes ensure 
that Native American children are safe and 
healthy. 
This legislation will help ensure that the 
Federal government is upholding its commit-
ments to help tribes and tribal organizations 
protect the next generation. 
Every Native child must have access to 
community-based, culturally appropriate serv-
ices that help them grow up safe, healthy, and 
spiritually strong—free from abuse, neglect, 
sexual exploitation, and the damaging effects 
of substance abuse. 
For this reason, I ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote in support of 
H.R. 1688.

IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN 
GEORGE SIRAGUSA 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Captain George Siragusa 
(USN, Ret.) on his retirement as the longtime 
Board Chair for Virginia’s 10th Congressional 
District, Service Academy Advisory Board. 
Captain Siragusa has served on the board 
since 2010 and as the Virginia District 10 
Board Chairman since 2014. The board has a 
body of over fifty military officers who annually 
screen high school students applying for a 
Congressional Nomination, a requirement for 
eligibility to obtain an appointment to the four 
Federal Service Academies. Under Captain 
Siragusa’s leadership, the board has success-
fully recommended nomination and subse-
quent admission to over 150 future members 
of the United States Armed Services to the 
four service academies. In addition to his lead-
ership 
to 
the 
board 
members, 
Captain 
Siragusa has served as an advisor and men-
tor to many of the candidates as they entered 
this rigorous and challenging endeavor. 
Outside of his service with the Federal Serv-
ice 
Academy 
Advisory 
Board, 
Captain 
Siragusa is a private sector consulting firm en-
trepreneur, investor, and adviser. He is also a 
seasoned leader-instructor at the university 
level for 10 years, having taught at the United 
States Naval Academy, George Washington 
University, Wake Forest University, and cur-
rently George Mason University where he is 
an adjunct professor at their Volgenau School 
of Engineering. He also serves as a Senior 
Business Adviser and Counselor to over 100 
clients in his portfolio at the George Mason’s 
Enterprise Center’s Small Business Develop-
ment Center. 
I congratulate Captain Siragusa on his re-
tirement and thank him for his service to Vir-

MSI STEM ACHIEVEMENT ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States is facing grave challenges on 
many fronts. We are only beginning to emerge 
from a global pandemic, with the outlook still 
uncertain. Our critical infrastructure, our Fed-
eral agencies, and companies across all sec-
tors are being hacked. We are racing to miti-
gate the destructive effects of climate change. 
Our economic competitiveness is threatened 
as competitors like China invest heavily in 
science and technology. 
To solve these problems, we need a cadre 
of trained scientists and engineers pushing the 
boundaries of what we know and what we can 
achieve. So far, we have led the world in 
science and innovation with a STEM work-
force that does not come close to representing 
the diversity of our nation. When a Black 
woman, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, is at the center 
of developing the mRNA vaccine that is help-
ing us conquer the pandemic, we treat it as 
exceptional, instead of expected. If we main-
tain such a narrow perspective on who should 
be a scientist, if we continue to leave behind 
so much of our nation’s brainpower, we can-
not succeed. 
The good news is, we have highly success-
ful models for increasing the diversity of STEM 
graduates. Minority serving institutions have 
long played a critical role in training and edu-
cating students of color in STEM fields. Stu-
dent bodies at Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities (TCUs), and Hispanic Serving Institu-
tions (HSIs) are the most diverse in the nation. 
These and other minority serving institutions 
(MSIs) offer access to STEM education and a 
pathway to research or other STEM careers to 
students who might otherwise have limited op-
portunities. MSIs employ tailored initiatives, 
policies, and practices that meet students 
where they are, academically, financially, and 
socially, while moving students toward higher 
levels of academic achievement. 
For instance, HBCUs play an outsized role 
in educating African American STEM grad-
uates. While HBCUs make up only 3 percent 
of the nation’s colleges and universities, they 
graduate 32 percent of African American stu-
dents earning bachelor’s degrees in the phys-
ical sciences, 29 percent in mathematics, and 
27 percent in the biological sciences. One 
quarter of African Americans with STEM PhDs 
earned their bachelor’s degree at an HBCU. 
MSIs have a proven track record of recruit-
ing, 
retaining, 
and 
graduating 
underrep-
resented minority students with STEM de-
grees. However, more investment and out-
reach is needed to enable MSIs to fully realize 
their potential to contribute to the STEM work-
force. The MSI STEM Achievement Act pro-
vides for increased transparency, account-
ability, and accessibility of Federal STEM edu-
cation and research funding for MSIs. The bill 
directs the Government Accountability Office 
to compile an inventory of programs targeted 
to MSIs and make recommendations for how 
agencies can increase competitiveness of 
MSIs in such programs. The bill also supports 
research on the challenges and successes 
MSIs have had in contributing to the STEM 
workforce, including support for MSI Centers 
of Innovation to help scale up successful prac-
tices pioneered at MSIs. Finally, the bill re-
quires the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP) to issue policy guidance for 
Federal science agencies to improve outreach 
to MSIs in order to increase awareness of and 
competitiveness in agency funding opportuni-
ties. 
I want to thank Rep. WALTZ for joining me 
in introducing this bipartisan legislation. I also 
want to thank the 24 organizations and institu-
tions that have endorsed H.R. 2027. 
MSIs have charted a course to developing 
the diverse STEM workforce we need to en-
sure continued leadership in science and inno-
vation. Let us empower these institutions, and 
others, to build on that success. I look forward 
to seeing a companion in the Senate and 
working with my colleagues in both bodies to 
get this legislation enacted.

CHIEF STANDING BEAR NATIONAL 
HISTORIC 
TRAIL 
FEASIBILITY 
STUDY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 810, legislation which 
authorizes the Department of the Interior to 
conduct a feasibility study of the Chief Stand-
ing Bear National Historic Trail. 
From his birth on the banks of the Niobrara 
River in Nebraska until his death in 1908, 
Chief Standing Bear spent his life in a con-
stant struggle to gain equality and justice for 
Native Americans. 
Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca Tribe 
were forced in 1877 by federal treaty to leave 
their homeland in Nebraska for Indian Territory 
in what is now Oklahoma. 
The hardship of travel and the conditions of 
Indian Territory caused the deaths of many 
members of the tribe, including Chief Standing 
Bear’s son. 
Determined to bury his son in his homeland, 
Chief Standing Bear led 30 members of his 
tribe back to Nebraska, where federal authori-
ties detained him. 
As a result, Chief Standing Bear became 
the first Native American recognized as a per-
son in a federal court decision rendered in 
Omaha at the trial following his return. 
Standing Bear’s case, United States, ex rel. 
Standing Bear, v. George Crook, started in 
May 1879. The U.S. government argued, ‘‘that 
[Standing Bear] was neither a citizen, nor a 
person, so he could not sue the government.’’ 
Standing Bear’s lawyers argued that under 
the Fourteenth Amendment, Standing Bear 
and his fellow Ponca were both citizens and 
people and entitled to the same constitutional 
rights as other citizens of the United States. 
The court fundamentally agreed with Stand-
ing Bear, writing, ‘‘That an Indian is a PER-
SON within the meaning of the laws of the 
United States . . .’’ 
Following the decision, the judge released 
Standing Bear and his people, and they re-
turned to their lands by the Niobrara where 
Standing Bear finally buried his son. 
The Chief Standing Bear National Historic 
Trail tracks the 550-mile path traces the jour-
ney the native Poncas were forced to make in 
1877 to Indian Territory in present-day Okla-
homa. 
The trail also marks the route the tribe took 
in 1879, when they returned to their home-
lands in present-day Nebraska. 
The nation has invested a great deal in pro-
tecting national parks and historic places due 
to their unique beauty, typographical features, 
or historic relevance. 
The stories that make up the American ex-
perience have, for far too long, been limited to 
those of one group of Americans. 
The limited view of what is of value or inter-
est to the American public has changed with 
the establishment of a Native American His-
tory Museum and most recently the opening of 
the National African American History and Cul-
ture on the Mall. 
The ‘‘whites-only’’ version of American his-
tory must end and at the same time we can 
make room for other American stories. 
The history of the United States is more 
complex and immensely richer than would be 
apparent if we only consider the history of one 
group of people. 
For this reason, last Congress I rose in sup-
port of the Emancipation National Historic Trail 
Act, which helped establish the Emancipation 
National Historical Trail, which will tell the 
story of African Americans and will preserve 
for future generations the rich history of the 
newlyfreed slaves who journeyed to Houston 
in search of economic and political oppor-
tunity, and greater religious and cultural free-
dom. 
Similarly, the development and designation 
of the Chief Standing Bear trail is one more 
important step in the ongoing goal to educate 
the public about Chief Standing Bear and the 
Ponca tribe’s forced relocation to Oklahoma. 
This story transcends race, ethnicity, cul-
ture, and serves as a starting point to bringing 
about a greater understanding of tribal sov-
ereignty, tribal rights, human rights, and equal-
ity for all peoples. 
The establishment of this trail will increase 
the general public’s knowledge and awareness 
of the story of Ponca Chief Standing Bear, in-
cluding his journey to Oklahoma and back and 
the historic court case in Omaha. 
For this reason, I ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote in support of 
H.R. 810.

HONORING ROBERT STENSRUD AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, as Mental 
Health Month begins, I rise to ask the House 
of Representatives to join me in honoring 
Drake University Graduate Professor of the 
School of Education’s Department of Leader-
ship, Counseling and Adult Development, 
Robert Stensrud. 
Professor Stensrud has been serving Iowa 
and its residents since he moved from Min-
nesota in 1970. He has dedicated his career 
to serving those with mental health needs and 
disabilities. He began his post-college career 
working with the Iowa Department of Edu-
cation’s Rehabilitation Education and Services 
Branch. It was here where he provided voca-
tional rehabilitation at the State Mental Health 
Institute serving inpatients experiencing acute 
psychosis, substance abuse, and related dis-
orders. In this position, he began to under-
stand the importance of having a solid, de-
pendable, and loving community. Most people 
who were released from his care did not have 
a community to return to, so they often strug-
gled to survive in society. 
Professor Stensrud has since dedicated his 
career to ensuring that all people feel impor-
tant and seen. Some of his recent research 
highlights the childhood to prison pipeline and 
school to prison pipeline, where without a 
sense of community and belonging, many indi-
viduals find themselves in less than ideal cir-
cumstances to combat their feeling of being 
an outcast. Professor Stensrud understood 
that in order to make a difference, it is essen-
tial to work with students from a young age to 
help combat these issues. Professor Stensrud 
has done research through a LAUNCH Grant 
funded by Drake Head Start and the Iowa De-
partment of Public Health on how mental 
health consultation can help improve coordina-
tion services for kids and their families, as well 
as how to train teachers and first responders 
to identify signs of trauma in children and act 
accordingly. 
Professor Stensruds next project will center 
around documenting the history and current 
operations of legacy farms in Iowa. Maintain-
ing long-standing legacy farms is no easy 
task, and the pressures often become too 
much for farmers. These stressors have been 
a large contributing factor to the increasing 
rate of suicide among farmers. Professor 
Stensrud wants to ensure that farmers in Iowa 
feel seen and appreciated while honoring their 
family’s legacy and incredible accomplish-
ments. 
If Professor Stensrud’s had one message to 
leave people with, it would be to show kind-
ness and compassion to others. It is essential 
that we take care of those around us who 
struggle with their mental health or who are in 
a tough situation. His greatest joy and the mo-
tivation he has for being a professor is watch-
ing his graduates go on to positively impact 
others and make the world a better place. As 
Professor Stensrud would say, you may not 
be able to change the world, but you can 
change a life that goes on to save another life, 
and another after that. Making people feel 
loved and wanted is the first step, and one I 
believe we should all strive to achieve. We 
should not allow people to suffer in silence, 
rather be an ear for them. It is my honor to 
recognize Professor Robert Stensrud as our 
Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
JOHN 
CARLSON’S CAREER IN PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of the career and service of Ho-
bart, Wisconsin resident, Mr. John Carlson. 
Mr. Carlson’s notable Transportation Secu-
rity Administration (TSA) career began in 
2002, serving as the Assistant Federal Secu-
rity Director (AFSD) for the Outagamie County 
Regional Airport, where he played a major role 
in the start-up of several TSA activities and 
assumed responsibility for day-to-day aviation 
security. In 2006, he was reassigned as the 
AFSD-Generalist at the Austin Straubel Inter-
national Airport (GRB) Hub and Spoke Federal 
Security Director (FSD) staff where he han-
dled compliance oversight, customer service, 
property accountability, safety, and model 
workplace strategies. 
Given his extensive knowledge and leader-
ship skills, Mr. Carlson would go on to assume 
roles where he was trusted to oversee a ma-
jority of TSA operations in four separate air-
ports in northern Wisconsin: Austin Straubel 
International Airport, (GRB), Central Wisconsin 
Airport (CWA), Rhinelander-Oneida County 
Airport (RHI) and Appleton International Air-
port (ATW formerly Outagamie County Re-
gional Airport). 
Before beginning his career of service with 
TSA, Mr. Carlson served the United States 
honorably for twenty years in the U.S. Army 
as an infantry and military intelligence officer 
until his retirement in 1995 as a Lieutenant 
Colonel. Mr. Carlson’s dedication and leader-
ship in the state of Wisconsin are incredibly 
valuable, and the service he provides to 
Northern Wisconsin and his country is remark-
able. 
As we look back on Mr. Carlson’s career, 
there is no doubt that he dedicated his life and 
career to making the world around him a 
safer, better place. Mr. Carlson’s continued 
service to both his country and his community 
is worthy of our highest admiration.

VA TRANSPARENCY & TRUST ACT 
OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
support Representative BOST’s bipartisan leg-
islation, the ‘‘VA Transparency and Trust Act,’’ 
or H.R. 2911, and for which Representative 
PAPPAS, Representative MANN, and I are origi-
nal co-sponsors. This bill provides additional 
oversight for the funds Congress made avail-
able 
to 
VA 
through 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act and the CARES 
Act in 2020, as well as the American Rescue 
Plan which we passed earlier this year. 
The purpose of H.R. 2911 is to direct the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to 
Congress a detailed plan for obligating and 
expending 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
funding 
made available to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs by the Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security, or CARES Act, or the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. H.R. 2911 
also requires the VA Office of Inspector Gen-
eral to report to Congress semi-annually on 
VA’s actual expenditures and obligations, 
comparing it to their detailed plan, and on 
other subjects. Finally, H.R. 2911 requires the 
Comptroller General of the United States to 
report to Congress twice—in 2022 and 2024—

on VA’s process for developing its funding re-
quest, among other subjects. 
Since the beginning of the coronavirus pan-
demic in early 2020, Congress has provided 
over $36 billion dollars in supplemental fund-
ing—that is, funds that are in addition to VA’s 
annual budget—to fund various pandemic-re-
lated operations and programs at VA. 
Specifically, Congress provided to VA: 
$60 million in the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act in March 2020 to support med-
ical services and medical community care; 
$19.5695 billion in the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security Act in March 2020 
to support medical services, community care, 
medical facilities, informational technology sys-
tems, general administration, and other pur-
poses; and $16.694 billion in the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 in January 2021 to 
support medical care and health needs, supply 
chain modernization, the VA Office of Inspec-
tor General, a COVID–19 veteran rapid re-
training assistance program, and other pur-
poses. 
With these significant investments in VA op-
erations and programs, legislation is needed 
to ensure that VA efficiently and effectively ob-
ligates and spends these funds to achieve De-
partment goals. The legislation provides ongo-
ing oversight opportunities for relevant Con-
gressional committees until all funds have 
been expended and provides for the VA Office 
of Inspector General and the Government Ac-
countability Office to provide intermittent re-
views of VA’s spending and allocation proc-
ess, similar to prior reporting. 
H.R. 2911 adds to the existing oversight on 
VA’s spending. It will enable greater trans-
parency for Congress and the public to ensure 
that these funds are spent wisely to support 
critical VA programs and services as we re-
cover from the COVID–19 pandemic.

IN MEMORY OF JAMES FRALEY 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor a special Kentuckian, Mr. James Fraley, 
from Bath County, Kentucky. 
Mr. Fraley was born May 7, 1928 in Mid-
land, Kentucky to World War I veteran Burns 
Fraley and Austa Fraley. He graduated from 
Salt Lick High School in 1948. After gradua-
tion, he enlisted in the United States Air 
Force, where he served in Korea, Japan, and 
stateside for 4 years. He was honorably dis-
charged in October of 1954. 
Following his military service, Mr. Fraley 
worked as one of the early Texas Eastern 
Transmission Pipeline employees in Wyoming 
for 35 years. After retiring, he drove a bus for 
Bath County Schools for 20 years, worked at 
Keeneland, was a 30-year member of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky’s 101 Club, and served on 
the Owingsville City Council. He was a 71- 
year member of the Free and Accepted Ma-
sons of Kentucky, where he served in several 
leadership roles. Mr. Fraley was also a mem-
ber of the Scottish Rite, the York Rite, Oleika 
Shrine Temple, and the Royal Order of Scot-
land. In 2018, Mr. Fraley received the Bath 
County Community Service Award in recogni-
tion for all the help and support he provided to 
an untold number of children in need of med-
ical assistance through the Shriners Hospital. 
Mr. Fraley was a servant leader who believed 
in helping others, particularly children. 
Mr. Fraley was married to his late wife 
Becky for 65 years and they had four children. 
Through his service to his country and to his 
local community, Mr. Fraley certainly left a 
positive mark on this world. Mr. Fraley, a great 
American, passed away on March 19, 2021. I 
am humbled to honor the memory of Mr. 
James Fraley before the United States Con-
gress.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
REVEREND E. BAXTER MORRIS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to Reverend E. Bax-
ter Morris, the ninth and longest-serving pastor 
of the iconic First Baptist Church in Mont-
gomery, Alabama. 
Rev. Morris was a graduate of Selma Uni-
versity with a Bachelor of Theology Degree. 
He studied at Alabama State University, 
Samford University Extension Division, and 
the National Baptist Congress of Christian 
Education. When he was still in school at 
Selma University, Rev. Morris was selected as 
First Baptist Church’s newest pastor in 1972. 
The First Baptist Church was founded by 
700 newly freed Black citizens after the Eman-
cipation Proclamation was recognized in Mont-
gomery in 1866. Church members completed 
the first church in 1867 on Columbus Street. 
The Columbus Street Church was destroyed 
by a fire, but was painstakingly rebuilt brick by 
brick using any bricks the parishioners could 
find. Completed in 1915, it became affection-
ately known as the ‘‘Brick A Day’’ Church. 
The First Baptist Church played a pivotal 
role in the civil rights movement. Under the 
pastorship of Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, it be-
came a meeting place for historic civil rights 
leaders. In 1961, it served as refuge for Free-
dom Riders who were subjected to mob vio-
lence at the Montgomery Greyhound Bus Sta-
tion and was the target of a Klu Klux Klan at-
tack when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other 
civil rights icons were worshipping inside. 
For almost 50 years, Rev. Morris led the 
Brick A Day congregation and made it his mis-
sion to acknowledge and preserve its rich his-
tory, while also continuing the church’s legacy 
of progress and social change. In addition to 
shepherding his own congregation, Rev. Mor-
ris served in various roles at several other reli-
gious 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Mont-
gomery-Antioch District Association of Baptist 
Churches and Missionary for the Alabama 
Baptist South East District State Convention. 
He also dedicated more than 20 years of serv-
ice to the Montgomery Police Department as 
chaplain. 
Rev. Morris was a pillar in his community 
and the true epitome of a servant leader. 
Buoyed by the strength and example of his 
predecessors, Rev. Morris lived his life to give, 
to support, and to uplift his fellow man. 
Every year, I bring young people from the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center in Oak-
land, CA on the Faith and Politics Congres-
sional Civil Rights Pilgrimage. Rev. Morris al-
ways greeted them with enthusiasm, kindness, 
and appreciation. Upon learning of his pass-
ing, they were heartbroken because he taught 
them so much and had earned their respect 
and admiration. 
Along with my youth leaders, I send our 
heartfelt condolences and love to Rev. Morris’ 
family, the First Baptist Church family, loved 
ones, friends, and community. 
Please join me in honoring Rev. E. Baxter 
Morris and his many contributions to First 
Baptist Church, and the community of Mont-
gomery, AL.
