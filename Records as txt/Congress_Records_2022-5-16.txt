Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MAY 16, 2022 
No. 83 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. ROSS). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
May 16, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DEBORAH 
K. ROSS to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m. 
f 
HIGH GAS PRICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as we stand here today, gaso-
line in my hometown of Altoona, Penn-
sylvania, costs an average of $4.49 per 
gallon; that is the highest price that 
we have ever paid for gasoline. 
On day one of his Presidency, Joe 
Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line. Just last week, President Biden 
doubled down on his failed policy of 
crushing American energy producers 
by canceling three key oil and natural 
gas leases. 
It is this reckless leadership that has 
led to record-breaking prices that have 
made it so hard for rural Americans to 
afford to drive to work, go to doctor 
appointments, visit relatives, or bring 
their kids to a baseball game. 
It is time to turn away from these 
failed policies and, once again, rely on 
the energy that lies beneath the feet of 
my 
constituents—the 
energy 
that 
comes from American coal, American 
oil, American natural gas, and Amer-
ican Marcellus shale. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot afford 
these high gas prices, and we cannot af-
ford this failed leadership.

CONGRATULATING ANDREW BURK, 
ST. JOHNS COUNTY TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Andrew 
Burk for being named St. Johns Coun-
ty Teacher of the Year. 
Mr. Burk received this honor for his 
work as band director and teaching 
sixth, seventh, and eighth grade music 
classes 
at 
Valley 
Ridge 
Academy. 
Teaching since 2017, he has received 
awards 
for 
both 
outstanding 
edu-
cational leadership and high academic 
classroom achievement. 
Mr. Burk uses innovative teaching 
methods to help students learn faster 
and play advanced music earlier in 
their musical development. Outside of 
the classroom, he was also a cofounder 
of the Collegiate Music Education Day 
at the Florida Capitol. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank Mr. 
Burk for his dedication to educating 
the students of northeast Florida and 
for his commitment to the success of 
his students and peers alike. 
CONGRATULATING THE FOAR FROM HOME 
ROWING TEAM 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate the FOAR 
From Home rowing team for crossing 
the Atlantic Ocean in 51 days, 11 hours, 
and 41 minutes. 
The team of four from Fernandina 
Beach rowed more than 3,000 miles, be-
ginning in the Canary Islands and end-
ing in Antigua. This unbelievable ac-
complishment was part of an annual 
race that takes place in December and 
included 30 different rowing teams. 
The FOAR From Home team con-
sisted of four American veterans: Billy 
Cimino of the United States Army, 
Cameron Hansen of the United States 
Air Force, A.M. Huppmann of the 
United States Navy, and Paul Lore of 
the United States Marine Corps. 
The team raised money to help end 
veteran suicide, with proceeds going to 
K9s for Warriors, an organization in 
northeast Florida that pairs service 
dogs with veterans suffering from 
PTSD. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank 
FOAR From Home for their individual 
service to our Nation, and I congratu-
late them on a once-in-a-lifetime team 
accomplishment. 
f 
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it 
has become painfully obvious in recent 
months how important energy and the 
energy supply is in all aspects of our 
lives here in the United States and to 
our allies around the world. 
The effect of not enough energy in-
deed has been very harmful to our 
economy, yet we are at a space where

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4974 
May 16, 2022 
we have so much abundance, so much 
potential, and so much we were doing 
just before this administration came 
into place. We are sitting on the larg-
est untapped oil reserve in the world— 
amazingly enough—here in the United 
States. 
If we had been utilizing this properly, 
instead of launching an assault on do-
mestic energy production, our Union 
would be in a much better state. As we 
know, on the first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden shut down the Keystone 
Pipeline, on and off, on and off over the 
years, suspended pending oil and gas 
leases, halted domestic energy produc-
tion, which stopped exports on lique-
fied natural gas to our allies overseas. 
We have seen how important that is 
when Europe has become so reliant on 
Russian natural gas. Poland recently 
just cut off supply buying from Russia 
so they would not be so dependent, as 
well as the Germans and other Eastern 
European countries. 
Now, what we have seen since all this 
lack of exploration and shortness of 
supply is the prices have skyrocketed 
on everybody. It is really hurting rural 
America, especially with the need for 
farming crops, fertilizer, all the dif-
ferent aspects that go into food produc-
tion, and that in return causes food 
shortages. 
We are really putting ourselves in a 
bad, bad position by having a lack of 
energy policy or one that is really an 
anti-energy policy. We have seen the 
national average for a gallon of gas up 
to $4.48. In California, it is getting clos-
er to $6 on average. 
What bothers me is that over time do 
people get lulled into this as being nor-
mal? No, folks, this is not normal, and 
it is not necessary. It doesn’t need to 
be this way because, as I mentioned, we 
have so much untapped energy in this 
country. The miracle of hydraulic frac-
turing has made natural gas so abun-
dant that we have been able to be a 
strong exporter of it. 
I remember not too many years ago 
we were figuring out, are we going to 
have to find a way to have our gas im-
ported and upgrade our ports to bring 
it in? No. Hydraulic fracturing has 
made possible cheap natural gas to ex-
port to our allies, such as in Western 
Europe. We need to be doing much, 
much more of that so we don’t have 
our friends, the Germans, and Poland, 
and others, that are reliant upon en-
ergy coming from Russia. 
With the regulatory and tax policies 
that have discouraged gas production, 
California only produces, for example, 
a fraction of what it is capable of when 
it was once one of the leading oil and 
gas-producing States. 
What would our Nation look like if 
we were producing to our full poten-
tial? It would probably look a lot like 
what we were 15–16 months ago when 
we had abundance in everything; en-
ergy, and food wasn’t emptying off the 
shelves. We would be in a much better 
space. 
Indeed, these short-sighted policies 
are harming regular, everyday Ameri-
cans. Food production, I can’t empha-
size enough, when we are running short 
on the shelves already—and this is be-
fore the 2022 crop has even been com-
pletely planted or come in—in my 
home State of California, probably half 
of agriculture is going to be shut down: 
half of agriculture. Why? Water policy. 
With that lack of water policy, all the 
water rushing out to the ocean in order 
to try to save an already missing fish 
or something called Delta salinity, we 
are not going to plant half of our agri-
culture in our home State. That has ef-
fects on American food: costs, avail-
ability, and quality. 
Are we just going to import it all? 
No, it is not going to work that way. It 
all strings together. It is all inter-
related. With that water policy, it also 
negatively affects energy because we 
are not going to make hydroelectric 
power like we can. 
This administration is hell-bent on 
getting rid of some of our dams in Cali-
fornia and others around the West that 
make 
hydroelectric 
power. 
Hydro-
electric power is CO2-free, no carbon di-
oxide. Our last nuclear power plant in 
California, they want to shut that 
down; CO2-free. 
The energy policy on all different as-
pects is collapsing. Indeed, 20 percent 
of the Nation’s power is from nuclear 
source, and about 25 percent of that 
power is threatened, that it will be 
shut down within the next 10 or 15 
years if things aren’t done to make up 
for that. We need an energy policy that 
makes sense.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Omnipotent God, ruler of the uni-
verse and source of all life, help us to 
love all that You are and all that You 
have created. May we show respect to 
both people and planet. In all that we 
see, may we regard everything as a pre-
cious gift from You to be revered and 
appreciated. 
At the same time, as we enjoy the 
amazing opportunities You have af-
forded us, the bounty of riches You 
have bestowed on us, the honor and 
privilege to have dominion over the 
Earth and all her resources, may our 
regard for the world never eclipse our 
love for You. 
We pray, instead, that You continue 
to reveal Yourself in the beauty of this 
Earth. May we have the faith to love 
You first, to look around at the re-
markable creation that surrounds us 
and see Your handiwork in all that we 
see. 
Likewise, we ask Your guidance that 
in the enjoyment of these countless 
gifts You have given us, that we wor-
ship the love that has provided them 
and not become so preoccupied with 
the gifts themselves that we cannot see 
the affection to be found in the hands 
that offer them. 
In all that surrounds us, may we 
know the love of the giver, and may 
our lives ever be lived in worship of 
You. 
By the power of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

PAIN AT THE PUMP 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
rising prices are straining families’ 
budgets and robbing them of the full 
benefits of our strong economic recov-
ery. 
Last year, we experienced the fastest 
rate of economic growth in four dec-
ades and the single greatest year of job 
creation ever. 
Thanks to this robust growth, work-
ers are securing better jobs with higher 
pay. Wages have risen more than 4 per-
cent since President Biden took office. 
Yet, even as inflation has slowed, ris-
ing prices are eating into families’ pay-
checks. To help cut costs for families, 
the House recently passed legislation 
to cap the price of insulin at $35. This 
week, the House will consider new leg-
islation to address pain at the pump. 
The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging 
Prevention Act would establish the 
first-ever Federal law against price 
gouging by oil and gas companies. 
Cutting costs and preventing profit-
eering, this is how we get our prices 
under control and put money back in 
people’s pockets.

May 16, 2022 
LICENSE NEW NUCLEAR 
REACTORS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden’s assault on domestic en-
ergy production isn’t limited to just 
gas and oil. A new report revealed that 
a quarter of nuclear power plants in 
the U.S. are at risk of closure in just a 
few years, raising already high energy 
costs to struggling families across the 
country. 
Despite being carbon-free, which my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
love to talk about carbon even though 
it represents only 0.04 percent of the 
gases in our atmosphere—let’s play 
along. 
Nuclear reactors make zero CO2, so 
why are we making it so difficult to 
put in place—indeed, only one nuclear 
reactor has started construction in the 
U.S. in the last three decades. Since 
2013, 12 reactors have closed, so none 
new have opened. 
Why are they making it so difficult 
to re-license existing plants or license 
new ones? 
Yes, we want to build in a strong 
safety factor. Why does it have to cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars or more 
to do the job to keep a CO2-free—0.04 
percent of our atmosphere—keep that 
CO2 down, keep these plants operating, 
and keep our homes lit up. 
f 
STAGFLATION IS COMING 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I come 
from the part of the country where 
people are used to working hard and 
making things. For some, it is pro-
ducing oil and natural gas. For others, 
it is farming. For me, it was owning a 
small business. 
What we do may be different, but 
why we do it is not. We want to provide 
a better life for our family and our 
children. That is the American Dream. 
That is what we strive for. That is 
what we sacrifice for. That is what 
Democrats’ radical policies are de-
stroying. 
Today, the ex-Chairman of the Fed-
eral Reserve said the U.S. economy is 
heading toward stagflation for the first 
time since the 1970s. Remember, in the 
late 1970s, Democrats had control of 
the White House, the Senate, and the 
House, just like they do now. 
The CEO of Goldman Sachs also said 
that the risk of falling into a recession 
is very high. 
Did you ever think that would hap-
pen in just 1 year of one-party rule? 
The last time we went through stag-
flation was in the 1970s after an oil sup-
ply shock. Today, Democrats’ radical 
policies are leading to a similar shock 
in terms of energy. 
Since April 2021, prices have risen at 
least 5 percent every month. This year, 
under one-party control, prices have 
risen at least 7 percent for 5 consecu-
tive months. 
Now, what does that mean to the av-
erage American? Well, it means to 
every single American, in gas costs 
alone, families will pay an extra $2,000 
this year to fill up at the pump. 
That is $2,000, Mr. Speaker. That is 
money that could have been used for 
their children’s education, summer va-
cation, or just paying the house pay-
ment or rent. 
Democrats are presiding over one of 
the costliest years in recent history, 
and the next year could be even worse. 
Americans 
need 
stable, 
competent 
leadership that understands the prob-
lems our country is facing. 
Want to lower the gas prices? The 
Republicans’ answer is to unleash 
American energy. The Democrats’ an-
swer is to hire another six-figure, out- 
of-touch Washington bureaucrat who 
has never run a business to tell people 
who work for a living what to do, or 
what the President did just a week ago: 
shut down more leases and opportunity 
for America to produce oil, but try to 
buy it somewhere else, maybe Russia. 
They are attacking energy producers 
to shift blame from their own failures. 
They have no better answers to the 
problems they created except to de-
mand more control. 
Mr. Speaker, that is what got us here 
in the first place. Last March, do we all 
remember when the Democrats dumped 
$2 trillion into a recovering economy 
and paid people not to work? 
I remember very well, Mr. Speaker. 
Over on this side of the aisle, we 
warned you if you go through with 
this, you will create inflation. 
Every single Democrat said no. They 
voted for it. Every single Republican 
knew what would happen, and they said 
no. They believed in the American peo-
ple: Don’t punish them. Don’t cost 
them more. 
Then, we heard the likes of it was 
transitory inflation; it wouldn’t last; it 
was only short term. Every month, 5 
percent growth, and then it went to 7 
percent, and now we have the ex-Fed 
Chair saying stagflation, something we 
haven’t seen since the 1970s. 
One-party rule, in only a year and a 
half, not only has created inflation like 
we haven’t seen in 40 years; it is put-
ting the punishment onto the Amer-
ican people. 
This $2 trillion that you claimed was 
going to go for COVID—when it is less 
than 9 percent—the scheme worked 
well for the well-connected when you 
are in one-party control. Blue States 
got bailouts. Washington Democrats 
got more power. Working families got 
crushed by the worst inflation in 40 
years. This is why Americans don’t 
trust Democrats. 
Mr. Speaker, for all of those watch-
ing, for all of those struggling to put 
gas in the tank and food on the table, 
we know Democrats think they can af-
ford to stay in power for 2 more years. 
The question is: Can you? 
EASE RESTRICTIONS ON 
CRIPPLING SUPPLY CHAINS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, every day, 
more and more families are struggling 
to find the basic goods they need to run 
their lives. This latest shortage, 40 per-
cent of all baby formula out of stock, 
highlights exactly how out of control 
this crisis has become. 
Orange 
County 
families 
are 
no 
stranger to the pressures of our broken 
supply chain. For months, we have 
been under the strain that millions of 
Americans are now experiencing. 
I have been calling on this adminis-
tration, as well as Governor Newsom, 
to ease the restrictions that are fur-
ther burdening our already crippled 
supply chains. 
From removing unworkable regu-
latory standards impacting the truck-
ing industry, to embracing American 
energy independence, there are con-
crete steps that the Governor and 
President can take to address this cri-
sis. 
They should do so immediately to 
provide relief to southern Californians 
and all Americans. 
f 
HONORING CHIEF COREY SIANEZ 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
during this National Police Week, I am 
delighted to rise today to honor Buena 
Park Police Chief Corey Sianez and his 
more than four decades of selfless serv-
ice to our community, including 11 
years as police chief. 
Throughout his many roles, Chief 
Sianez set an example of excellence in 
our police department and created the 
first 5-year strategic plan in the de-
partment’s history. 
While he is a well-known, active 
member of our Buena Park commu-
nity, his impact can also be seen across 
neighboring cities. He helped create 
the North Orange County Public Task 
Force, which is a partnership between 
cities that works to address pressing 
public safety issues such as homeless-
ness, 
incarceration, 
and 
gang 
and 
youth violence. 
Chief Sianez, thank you for your un-
relenting dedication to safety and the 
well-being of our community. I wish 
you a wonderful retirement.

organization, the Howard Area Lion’s 
Club, so I know firsthand the good that 
this club does around the world. 
Just a few years ago, during a Lion’s 
Club reception at the Capitol Visitor 
Center, I spoke with a Lion named 
Jimmy Ross. Jimmy is a past president 
of Lions Club International, and he or-
ganized the Capitol Hill visit that year. 
He shared an idea to create a congres-
sional caucus to highlight the work 
and the policies of nonprofit service or-
ganizations 
like 
Lions, 
Rotary, 
Kiwanis, Optimist, and others, and I 
loved the idea. 
Together with Congressman JIMMY 
PANETTA of California, who is a Rotar-
ian, we founded the Congressional 
Service Organization Caucus in 2019. 
Tomorrow, the Congressional Service 
Organization Caucus will host its first 
briefing. Speakers from Lions, Rotary, 
Kiwanis, and Optimist clubs will share 
how their members strive to make the 
world a better place one community at 
a time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join the Congressional Service Organi-
zation Caucus to ensure that service to 
others remains a vital part of Amer-
ican life for generations to come. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I wasn’t going 
to use this 1-minute time, but I just 
got a text from some contacts down on 
the border in south Texas from Eagle 
Pass with drone footage of yet another 
enormous group that is crossing ille-
gally onto private property around 
Eagle Pass. A Texas soldier tells us 
that there have been 2,000-plus cross-
ings in this specific spot in the last 8 
days, yet the Secretary of Homeland 
Security testified in the House Judici-
ary Committee that ‘‘he and this ad-
ministration have operational control 
of the border.’’ 
But this is factually incorrect. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle do not seem interested in hav-
ing a debate or a discussion here on the 
floor of the people’s House about a cri-
sis facing the State of Texas and the 
entire country. Over 107,000 Americans 
died last year from drug poisonings and 
drug overdoses, yet I get crickets from 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, do you want to know 
what is happening in south Texas? 
Hispanics in south Texas are flocking 
away from a party that doesn’t care if 
they suffer or if migrants suffer while 
dead bodies rack up in the Rio Grande 
and the ranches of south Texas. They 
have had enough, I have had enough, 
and the people of Texas have had 
enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4977 
May 16, 2022 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin debate on 
today’s legislation, I will take a mo-
ment 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
tragic, 
bloody events of this weekend in Mil-
waukee, Buffalo, and Orange County, 
California. The loss of life and extent 
of injury to innocent people, as we all 
know, are staggering. 
These incidents are all under inves-
tigation but, from a homeland security 
perspective, I will zero in, in par-
ticular, on the events in New York 
where we have, I think, a fairly good 
picture of what motivated a man to 
gun down innocent people, an event 
that has happened too many times in 
recent history in our country. 
This young man clearly was moti-
vated by an idea, a hateful idea and a 
racist idea, and one that is sadly famil-
iar to us. It is the same idea that moti-
vated another man to gun down Afri-
can Americans in Charleston, South 
Carolina. It is the same idea that moti-
vated yet another man to gun down 
Hispanic Americans in El Paso, Texas. 
It is the same idea that motivated an-
other man to gun down Jewish Ameri-
cans in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
It is an idea that spreads on the 
internet. But it doesn’t just spread or-
ganically. 
Social 
media 
companies 
write algorithms deliberately designed 
to connect people who are susceptible 
to this hateful idea to others who may 
be propagating it. It is an idea that 
sadly is sometimes amplified and le-
gitimized 
by 
political 
leaders 
and 
media personalities in our country. 
We have a domestic terrorism prob-
lem in America. We all understand that 
on the Homeland Security Committee. 
If this problem was coming from out-
side the United States, it would be easy 
for us to come together to deal with it. 
Imagine if after the September 11 at-
tacks there were cable news hosts who 
night after night propagated ideas 
straight from al-Qaida’s propaganda 
materials. We wouldn’t tolerate it. No-
body would for one moment think that 
was acceptable in the United States of 
America. But because it is a domestic 
problem rooted in our own society, it is 
harder. We have to find a way to come 
together, nonetheless. 
I think there are two kinds of leaders 
in America today, not Democrat, Re-
publican, 
liberal, 
or 
conservative. 
There are leaders who, when they see a 
fire burning, they reach for a bucket of 
water to put it out. And there are lead-
ers who, when they see a fire burning, 
reach for a can of gasoline to make 
that fire burn even more. We des-
perately need leaders in this country, 
of both political parties, who will try 
to calm things down and who will tamp 
down these horrible, hateful ideas, 
whether they are coming from the left 
or the right, wherever they are coming 
from, because these ideas are leading 
to people being gunned down in our 
country. It is unacceptable, and it has 
to stop. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s turn to the legisla-
tion before us today. 
Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we are for-
tunate to have so many dedicated pub-
lic servants who work for our Federal 
Government and help keep us safe. Un-
fortunately, they frequently go with-
out the recognition they deserve for 
their hard work. The President’s Cup 
Cybersecurity Competition Act author-
izes an innovative prize competition 
where cyber talent within the ranks of 
Federal departments and agencies is 
honored. 
Today, it is critical to our homeland 
and national security that the Federal 
Government attract, develop, and re-
tain dedicated and talented employees 
to carry out cybersecurity and cyber 
defense activities. It is not lost on me 
that, by choosing to work for the gov-
ernment rather than the private sec-
tor, 
these 
in-demand 
professionals 
often forgo more lucrative career op-
portunities. 
H.R. 6824 would authorize the cyber 
competition that CISA hosts and en-
sure that financial awards can be pro-
vided to the winning individuals and 
teams in recognition of their achieve-
ment. In the short period of time that 
the President’s Cup has been around, it 
has become a much-sought-after prize 
among talented Federal cyber practi-
tioners, many of whom are civilians or 
active military. By permanently au-
thorizing this competition, Congress 
can ensure that it remains a vital part 
of our strategy to identify, retain, and 
reward the best cybersecurity talent in 
the Federal Government. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Representa-
tive LURIA for her leadership in author-
ing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6824, the President’s Cup Cyber-
security Competition Act. 
Mr. Speaker, you merely have to 
turn on the news to hear about the lat-
est ransomware problem that con-
tinues to vex our country. According to 
research funded by the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology, 
there is a deficit of almost half a mil-
lion cybersecurity employees in the 
U.S. Now more than ever, it is critical 
that the Federal Government provide 
cybersecurity education and pathways 
to Federal employment and make Fed-
eral retention of this limited skill set a 
priority. 
One very important effort is under-
pinned by the President’s Cup Cyberse-
curity Competition Act. CISA launched 
the first President’s Cup Cybersecurity 
Act in 2019, as a national cybersecurity 
competition for both individuals and 
teams, aiming to identify, challenge, 
and reward the best cybersecurity tal-
ent in the Federal workforce. 
This bill grants CISA the authority 
to fully implement the cybersecurity 
competition with certain parameters 
and provide prizes to winning individ-
uals and teams. By codifying the cyber-
security 
competition, 
we 
further 
incentivize 
a 
skilled 
cybersecurity 
workforce. We also signal that Con-
gress is committed to addressing Fed-
eral cybersecurity recruitment and re-
tention challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 6824, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, the President’s Cup Cy-
bersecurity Competition has been an 
important part of our strategy to sup-
port a strong Federal cybersecurity 
workforce in recent years. Unfortu-
nately, without congressional author-
ization, it lacks the stability it needs. 
So thanks to this legislation, authored 
by 
my 
committee 
colleague, 
Rep-
resentative LURIA, we have the oppor-
tunity to authorize and preserve a key 
retention tool in the Federal toolbox to 
ensure that talented Federal cyber pro-
fessionals get the recognition they de-
serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6824, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, a critical element 
of strengthening our nation’s cybersecurity is 
ensuring the Federal government employs the 
best and the brightest with the most advanced 
cybersecurity skills. 
Whether at CISA, our intelligence agencies, 
our military, or at other departments across 
the Federal government, cybersecurity profes-
sionals play an essential role in keeping our 
nation safe, and we must prioritize their re-
cruitment, development, and retention. 
Unfortunately, it has been challenging to 
compete with the private sector for cyber tal-
ent, so we must look to creative ways to 
strengthen the Federal cyber workforce. 
The President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competi-
tion is one innovative part of that effort. 
Organized by CISA, this annual cybersecu-
rity competition brings together cybersecurity 
professionals, both civilian and military, from 
across the Federal government to compete in 
a series of challenges that test a wide range 
of cybersecurity skills. 
My legislation would authorize this competi-
tion to ensure it remains part of our Federal 
cyber workforce strategy and grants CISA the 
necessary authorities to fully carry out the pro-
gram. 
Importantly, it addresses legal barriers that 
have prevented CISA from directly providing 
cash prizes to winning teams and individuals 
that work in other departments or agencies. 
H.R. 6824 specifically authorizes CISA to 
confer cash prizes to the winners, many of 
whom are in the military, for their achieve-
ment. 
By passing this legislation, we demonstrate 
our commitment to further developing a com-
petitive and highly skilled Federal cybersecu-
rity workforce. 
I thank Representatives CONNOLLY
and 
GARBARINO
for cosponsoring this bill, and 
Chairman THOMPSON and Ranking Member 
KATKO for their support for authorizing this im-
portant program. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this bipartisan bill and look forward to 
working with them to get it enacted into law.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, in recent months the 
world has watched in horror as Russia 
launched its unprovoked and illegal in-
vasion of Ukraine. Russia’s actions 
have, once again, reminded us of the 
potential for cyberattacks on critical 
infrastructure 
here 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
With State and local governments 
operating large amounts of critical in-
frastructure, including essential public 
services like schools, emergency re-
sponse agencies, and water utilities, it 
is essential that State and local gov-
ernments have strong cybersecurity 
practices. 
In March, in response to the current 
threat landscape, President Biden sent 
a letter to the Nation’s Governors urg-
ing them to take actions to enhance 
their cyber defenses. The Federal Gov-
ernment must continue to expand our 
partnerships with States as they carry 
out this important national security 
work. 
Congress has already taken some 
critical steps in this effort this Con-
gress, thanks to the leadership of my 
colleagues on the Homeland Security 
Committee. 
Last 
year, 
the 
House 
passed 
Congresswoman 
YVETTE 
CLARKE’s State and Local Cybersecu-
rity Improvement Act which created a 
new grant program to assist State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial Govern-
ments with strengthening their cyber-
security. This legislation was signed by 
President Biden in the fall as part of 
the bipartisan infrastructure law and 
will provide $1 billion in much-needed 
help over the next 4 years. 
Additionally, 
last 
year, 
Congress 
passed the K–12 Cybersecurity Act in-
troduced by Senator PETERS and Con-
gressman LANGEVIN. That bill directs 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency to study the cyber 
risks posed to K–12 educational institu-
tions and provide them with additional 
resources to better defend themselves. 
Right now, I am proud to be working 
on a bipartisan basis with Senators 
Peters and Cornyn, and my Homeland 
Security Committee colleague Rep-
resentative GARBARINO, on the Sat-
ellite 
Cybersecurity 
Act, 
urgently 
needed legislation to better protect 
critical infrastructure used at the mu-
nicipal, State, and Federal level that 
relies on commercial satellite data to 
work properly. 
Passing S. 2520 will build on these ef-
forts by further strengthening the rela-
tionship between DHS and State and 
local Governments as they work to de-
fend our country against cyberattacks. 
More specifically, it would permit DHS 
to provide State and local Govern-
ments with access to cybersecurity re-
sources and encourage collaboration in 
using these resources, including joint 
cybersecurity exercises. 
b 1430 
Additionally, the bill will strengthen 
the relationship between DHS and the 
Multi State Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center to help State and local 
governments receive the most updated 
information 
regarding 
potential 
threats and gain access to greater tech-
nical assistance. 
I 
thank 
Senators 
PETERS
and 
PORTMAN for their leadership in intro-
ducing this bill, I urge my colleagues 
to support the legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4979 
May 16, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2520, the State and Local Govern-
ment Cybersecurity Act of 2021. 
Today, State and local governments 
are not in the position to defend their 
networks against cyberattacks from 
sophisticated foreign adversaries or 
cybercriminals. State and local govern-
ments are rich targets for cyber adver-
saries, and the frequency of attacks is 
only accelerating as budgets are in-
creasingly constrained. 
The Federal Government needs to re-
double their efforts to support State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial govern-
ment entities to bolster their cyberse-
curity posture. 
To help remedy this, this bill amends 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to 
provide for engagements with SLTT 
entities to increase Federal support 
and information sharing. 
Additionally, the bill expands DHS’ 
responsibilities concerning grants and 
cooperative agreements. The bill also 
provides DHS the ability to coordinate 
with SLTT entities to conduct exer-
cises, 
provide 
technical 
and 
oper-
ational cybersecurity training, as well 
as promote cybersecurity education 
and awareness. 
S. 2520 will help shore up SLTT vul-
nerabilities 
against 
malicious 
cyberattackers and will go a long way 
to strengthen our more localized enti-
ties that are closer to the everyday 
American. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting S. 2520, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we rely on State and 
local governments for some of our most 
basic and necessary public services. We 
have seen many communities across 
the country experience disruptions in 
those vital services due to ransomware 
attacks originating from Russia. 
In this current threat environment, 
with a heightened risk of even more 
dangerous cyberattacks, S. 2520 would 
enhance 
DHS’s 
collaboration 
with 
State and local governments in ad-
dressing this pressing national security 
threat. 
By passing this bill and sending it to 
the President, we will continue our on-
going efforts to expand critical Federal 
cybersecurity assistance to State and 
local governments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 2520, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 2520. 
The question was taken.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

BOMBING PREVENTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6873) to amend the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 to establish the Of-
fice for Bombing Prevention to address 
terrorist explosive threats, and for

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, between January 4 and 
February 16 of this year, there were 
over 50 bomb threats that dispropor-
tionately targeted historically Black 
colleges 
and 
universities, 
Black 
churches, mosques, and synagogues 
across our country. 
These racially and ethnically tar-
geted bomb threats have continued 
through the spring. They have sowed 
fear, disrupted academic instruction, 
and interfered with the ability of 
Americans to worship safely. 
They have also brought into focus 
the diversity of the current homeland 
security threat picture and reminded 
us that conventional threats, like

May 16, 2022 
bombings, deserve sustained attention, 
even as efforts to counter mass shoot-
ings and cyber threats have to be in-
tensified. 
I introduced H.R. 6873, the Bombing 
Prevention Act of 2022, for the first 
time to authorize the Office for Bomb-
ing Prevention. 
For the past 15 years, the Office for 
Bombing Prevention has been respon-
sible for coordinating DHS’ efforts at 
preventing, protecting against, miti-
gating the effects of, and responding to 
improvised explosive devices here do-
mestically, and helping our partners 
and allies around the world do the 
same. 
The Office for Bombing Prevention is 
squarely focused on protecting critical 
infrastructure, working with private 
sector partners, and supporting our 
Federal, State, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial entities to mitigate explosive ef-
fects on critical infrastructure. 
To that end, it regularly engages 
with 
stakeholders, 
including 
edu-
cational stakeholders, about accessing 
the office’s training and tools, such as 
its counter-IED capability. 
H.R. 6873 would bring needed perma-
nence and predictability to the oper-
ations of this office and position it to 
build capacity to meet growing de-
mands for its services. 
Importantly, my bill directs the of-
fice to develop a strategy that aligns 
its operations with the threat environ-
ment and stakeholder needs; improves 
the sharing of information about explo-
sive threats; and enhances awareness of 
the office’s capabilities to those around 
the country who are most at risk. 
The bill also directs the Secretary of 
the DHS to provide to public- and pri-
vate-sector entities technical assist-
ance services related to countering 
these explosive threats. 
Finally, to keep the office account-
able, H.R. 6873 requires an annual re-
port to Congress. 
This bipartisan legislation, which I 
was pleased to introduce with my col-
league from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD), 
will better position the Office for 
Bombing 
Prevention 
to 
provide 
counter-explosives resources to stake-
holders as the threat environment 
changes, making communities across 
America more secure and helping to 
ensure that in this country, no person 
should have to work, study, or worship 
while living in fear of a terrorist bomb-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6873, the Bombing Prevention 
Act of 2022. Between just January 4 and 
February 16 of this year, the FBI re-
ported more than 50 bomb threats 
against domestic targets. 
The DHS Office of Bombing Protec-
tion, or OBP, has a mission to protect 
life 
and 
critical 
infrastructure 
by 
building capabilities within the general 
public and across public and private 
sectors to prevent, protect against, re-
spond to, and mitigate bombing inci-
dents. 
To that end, this bill will more aptly 
enable OBP to conduct its mission by 
requiring: a strategy for securing crit-
ical infrastructure against terrorist ex-
plosives; promoting awareness of risks 
posed by the misuse of explosive 
chemicals and bomb-making materials; 
and a database of capabilities and re-
quirements to track public and private 
terrorist explosive threats. 
This legislation is a critical step to-
ward ensuring that threats to our do-
mestic security posed by bombings and 
malicious use of explosives is miti-
gated to the best of our ability. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 6873, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my cosponsor for his work on 
this, and I can’t tell you how thrilled I 
am to see this bill come to the House 
floor for consideration. 
As a former Army bomb tech, I know 
how critical it is for our military to be 
adequately equipped on the front lines 
to dispose of explosive threats. This is 
all the more true on our home front, 
where the public safety continues to be 
threatened by terrorists and other bad 
actors who consistently use bombs and 
explosive hazards to advance their 
agenda. 
But it should not take a tragedy to 
enact sensible change and to continue 
to equip our homeland security offi-
cials with the tools they need to miti-
gate bombing incidents and to protect 
the critical infrastructure of our Na-
tion and the lives of our citizens. 
The Office for Bombing Prevention, 
or OBP, was created in response to ter-
rorism events, both at home and 
abroad, including the bombing of a Pan 
Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 
1988; the World Trade Center in 1993; 
Oklahoma City in 1995; a Madrid train 
in 2004; London in 2005; the Boston Mar-
athon in 2013; and Nashville on Christ-
mas Day in 2020. 
OBP leads the Department of Home-
land Security’s efforts to implement 
the National Policy for Countering Im-
provised Explosive Devices and en-
hances the Nation’s ability to prevent, 
protect against, respond to, and miti-
gate the use of explosives against crit-
ical infrastructure, the private sector, 
and Federal, State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial entities. 
Currently, the OBP sits underneath 
the jurisdiction of the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or 
CISA. However, our recent history has 
proven that OBP needs a bit of pro-
motion in order to adequately inform 
the Secretary of Homeland Security on 
ongoing threats and to keep the gen-
eral public out of harm’s way. 
I say recent history because, unfortu-
nately, our Nation has not been safe 
from threats, most of which, thank-
fully, never led to serious injury, de-
struction, or death. The 2010 Times 
Square car bombing attempt, the IEDs 
left outside the RNC and DCCC on Jan-
uary 6, 2021, and over 50 reported bomb 
threats between January and February 
of this year targeted disproportion-
ately 
at 
HBCUs, 
Black 
churches, 
mosques, and synagogues. 
It is our responsibility as Members of 
Congress to lead and address these un-
acceptable 
threats 
while 
simulta-
neously reducing the amount of threats 
designed to instill fear in the public. I 
applaud my colleagues for responding 
to these events seriously and appro-
priately, and I have full confidence the 
OBP will have the tools necessary to 
carry out this mission. 
Our bill authorizes OBP and directs 
the office to develop a strategy for fur-
ther securing critical infrastructure 
against terrorist explosive threats and 
attacks and to evaluate effective tech-
nologies to defend against them. Fur-
ther, OBP will be required to promote 
security awareness of risks posed by 
the 
misuse 
of 
explosive 
precursor 
chemicals, 
bomb-making 
materials, 
providing technical assistance to the 
public and private sectors to support 
security 
preparedness, 
assist 
other 
agencies with information sharing and 
responding to various threats, and 
working with relevant stakeholder in-
terests in bettering this overall effort. 
It has come to my attention that in 
response to the bomb threats at our 
HBCUs, the OBP led a briefing with 150 
leaders on training opportunities and 
engaged with educational stakeholders 
about accessing OBP’s counter-IED ca-
pability development programs, infor-
mation, training, and tools. This kind 
of responsiveness to a dire situation 
only strengthens my confidence that 
the men and women at OBP are ready 
and informed to respond to ongoing 
bomb threats and prevent further inci-
dents and potential devastation. 
We should be proud, as Americans, to 
feel a sense of security each and every 
day. Security and strength are what 
brings us together and the foundation 
for what we fight for. Unfortunately, 
we live the reality that anyone can be 
a threat to this security and strength, 
even when we least expect it, from our 
grocery stores, to our places of wor-
ship, to our schools. We must continue 
to fight and ensure that Americans live 
free from fear of the malicious use of 
explosives and from the threat of a ter-
rorist’s agenda. Our citizens should feel 
and remain secure at their jobs, their 
schools, and, most importantly, around 
their families. That is my mission as a 
Member of Congress; that will be the 
mission of the Office for Bombing Pre-
vention, and that is why I support H.R. 
6873. 
I thank my co-lead, Representative 
MALINOWSKI, one more time, as well as

Representative KATKO for his leader-
ship on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, and for meeting with me to dis-
cuss my priorities for bombing preven-
tion from our service branches to the 
domestic front. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
Members to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in my home State of 
New Jersey, there have been more than 
25 bomb scares since 2020, threatening 
public schools, universities, commu-
nity centers, and religious institutions. 
Just last fall in my district, the 
Roxbury Township school system re-
ceived a bomb threat that led to panic 
and K9 sweeps on school property dur-
ing teaching hours, and nearby Hope-
well Valley Central High School en-
countered an explosive threat that 
forced the school to evacuate and shut 
down early for the day. 
In addition, 7 years ago this Sep-
tember, over a 2-day period, commu-
nities in Seaside Park and Elizabeth, 
New Jersey, as well as the Chelsea 
neighborhood 
of 
Manhattan 
were 
rocked by three bombings that wound-
ed 31 people. 
Subsequent analysis done by the Of-
fice for Bombing Prevention at DHS 
determined that each of the devices 
planted by the assailant was com-
pletely different from the others. 
Two of the bombs were pipe bombs, 
two were homemade pressure cooker 
bombs, some used modified Christmas 
tree lights and cellphones, and one of 
the pressure cooker bombs used two 
different chemicals that alone are not

The office concluded that while each 
of the bombs was different, all included 
elements detailed in several issues of 
al-Qaida’s Inspire magazine. 
The invaluable analysis carried out 
by the office in the wake of the Sep-
tember 2016 New Jersey-area attacks 
was shared with first responders and 
homeland security stakeholders all 
across the country, underscoring the 
expertise of the Office for Bombing 
Prevention and the important role it 
plays in equipping our communities 
with the best information available to 
keep the public safe. 
Today, the office provides critical 
support to help defend communities 
across America from the threats posed 
by explosives, but we need to empower 
it to do more. The Bombing Prevention 
Act does just that. It has been endorsed 
by the Anti-Defamation League and by 
the Jewish Federations of North Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6873, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6873, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6825, the Nonprofit Security 
Grant Program Improvement Act. 
More than 20 years after the Sep-
tember 11 attacks, the terrorism threat 
landscape has grown significantly more 
complex, and houses of worship and 
other nonprofits have become targets 
for domestic and foreign terrorists. 
Earlier this year, four Americans 
were held at gunpoint by a terrorist at 
a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. Dur-
ing the Colleyville attack, Rabbi Char-
lie Cytron-Walker used security train-
ing to help bring the standoff to an end 
without injury to his congregants. 
The training that proved so crucial 
that Sabbath was funded by the De-
partment of Homeland Security’s Non-
profit Security Grant Program. The 
NSGP, as it has come to be known, is 
a competitive grant program that pro-
vides funding to nonprofit organiza-
tions, such as religious institutions, at 
high risk of a terrorist attack to help 
bolster their security. 
Grant funding is primarily used to 
pay for active shooter training, fenc-
ing, barriers, and surveillance cameras. 
In recent years, demand for the pro-
gram has grown exponentially, given 
the heightened threat environment 
that we face. Over the past 3 years, to 
meet this demand, Congress has in-
creased funding almost threefold to 
$250 million in fiscal year 2022. 
Even with significant new resources, 
FEMA reported that, in fiscal year 
2021, there was a $200 million gap be-
tween applications and funding. To 
provide FEMA with more resources to 
help bolster the security of more at- 
risk nonprofits, H.R. 6825 authorizes 
$500 million in grant funding for fiscal 
years 2023 to 2028. 
This bipartisan bill, which was intro-
duced by the leaders of the Committee 
on 
Homeland 
Security, 
Chairman 
BENNIE THOMPSON and Ranking Mem-
ber JOHN KATKO, also includes a range 
of enhancements to the program’s op-
erations. 
H.R. 6825 would establish a dedicated 
program office to carry out education, 
outreach, and engagement to provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
support. 
Among other things, it includes tech-
nical changes to eliminate or prevent 
administrative or operational obstacles 
that may impact access by eligible ap-
plicants; sets baseline requirements for 
States that administer the program; 
and requires audits to prevent waste, 
fraud, and abuse. 
The legislation, which was developed 
in close coordination with FEMA, was 
unanimously supported by the com-
mittee in March. 
Before I conclude, I would like to ad-
dress an article that appeared in the 
Jewish Link, a prominent news outlet 
for the Jewish community in New Jer-
sey and New York, in which questions 
were raised about the grant guidance 
for the program for the current fiscal 
year. 
On behalf of Chairman THOMPSON, let 
me express my appreciation to Rep-
resentatives 
PASCRELL
and 
GOTTHEIMER, in particular, for alerting 
the committee to these concerns and 
the chairman’s commitment to engage 
FEMA about the questions that were 
raised. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6825, 
the Nonprofit Security Grant Program 
Improvement Act of 2022. 
FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant 
Program is an important resource 
available to nonprofit organizations, 
especially our houses of worship. As we 
all 
know, 
faith-based 
communities 
across the country face varying levels 
of discrimination, and it is vital that 
we strengthen our Nation’s emergency 
preparedness posture to prevent vio-
lence against all religious groups. 
H.R. 6825 expands the use of Non-
profit Security Grant Program funds to 
include alteration or remodeling of ex-
isting buildings or physical facilities 
and facility security personnel costs, 
including costs associated with con-
tracted security. 
This bill requires more account-
ability on the part of FEMA to Con-
gress by requiring the Administrator of 
FEMA to include information on the 
number of applications submitted by 
eligible nonprofit organizations to each 
State, the number of applications sub-
mitted by each State, and specific op-
erations of the grant office in FEMA’s 
annual report to Congress. 
Finally, this legislation also estab-
lishes an office within FEMA to pro-
vide outreach, engagement, education, 
and technical assistance to support eli-
gible nonprofit organizations. This will 
better ensure that eligible organiza-
tions, including houses of worship, 
know the resources available to them. 
I urge Members to support H.R. 6825, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4984 
May 16, 2022 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, as an 
original member of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee, I had the pleasure of 
serving with Chairman THOMPSON. It 
has only been lately that we under-
stand what he means to this country. 
Together, we worked to establish and 
grow the Nonprofit Security Grant 
Program into what it is now. 
I associate myself with the words of 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) and our associates from 
Arkansas and Kansas. I hope people lis-
tened to what they had to say on the 
previous bill because knowledge is 
power in trying to keep the American 
people safe. 
From Jersey City, to Colleyville, to 
Pittsburgh, our faith-based commu-
nities 
have 
become 
targets. 
Our 
churches, synagogues, and mosques are 
facing increased volatility, unpredict-
ability, and threats. Now, that is either 
a fact or it is not a fact. 
The Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram is a vital tool to help keep people 
safe from this dire threat. H.R. 6825 
recognizes this growing threat by in-
creasing the program’s authorization, 
as you just heard. It is money that will 
be well spent. 
We must ensure that every commu-
nity can get these resources. Too many 
communities do not have the historic 
ability to even write a grant, believe it 
or not. 
But revising the formula should not 
create obstacles for high-threat com-
munities or regions, like my home 
State of New Jersey. I am closely mon-
itoring the new formula FEMA has of-
fered. It will give preference to applica-
tions with a higher Social Vulner-
ability Index. 
It is one of the pillars of America 
that our neighbors are secure in their 
houses of worship. I will fight hard for 
fairness in distributing these funds. 
I applaud Chairman THOMPSON
for 
bringing this bill to the floor. Domestic 
terrorism threatens every community 
in our Nation, and we blew it 12 years 
ago. It is something I have warned 
about over a decade, and it is not abat-
ing but growing. 
This funding will save lives and se-
cure houses of worship. I urge swift 
passage of H.R. 6825. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I urge Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), chairman of the Homeland 
Security Committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, violence shattered commu-
nities across the country this weekend, 
making it a very sad one for this Na-
tion. 
First, on Friday night in Milwaukee, 
21 people were injured in a mass shoot-
ing as the city hosted the NBA play-
offs. Then, on Saturday, a gunman who 
posted a manifesto online espousing 
violent white supremacist viewpoints 
drove 2 hours to a grocery store in a 
predominantly Black area of Buffalo 
and opened fire on customers, killing 10 
innocent people. Finally, yesterday, in 
Laguna Woods, California, an armed in-
truder burst into a predominantly Tai-
wanese Christian congregation meeting 
in a Presbyterian church, killing one 
congregant and critically wounding 
four others. 
Today, we mourn with these commu-
nities and families who were rocked by 
this violence, but we also must con-
tinue asking tough questions about 
what is fueling such racially motivated 
violent extremism. 
Just months ago, FBI Director Chris-
topher Wray told Congress domestic 
terrorism is metastasizing through this 
country and was not going away any 
time soon. The intelligence community 
has recently warned that racially moti-
vated violent extremism poses the 
most lethal domestic terrorism threat. 
While Americans may not see eye-to- 
eye on what factors contribute to the 
current threat landscape, there seems 
to be general agreement that public 
spaces, in general, and houses of wor-
ship, in particular, need to be more se-
cure. 
That is where the Nonprofit Security 
Grant Program comes in. This grant 
program is incredibly important to at- 
risk nonprofits that need to bolster 
their security against mass shootings 
and terrorism threats. 
In 2020, I was proud to author legisla-
tion that was enacted into law to au-
thorize this program. Today, I am here 
in support of H.R. 6825, legislation I in-
troduced in the wake of a terrorist at-
tack on a synagogue in Colleyville, 
Texas, to expand the availability of 
crucial funding to more at-risk non-
profits and improve the program’s op-
erations. 
My legislation, Mr. Speaker, does so 
by increasing the authorization for 
funding 
to 
$500 
million 
annually 
through fiscal year 2028 and by estab-
lishing a dedicated program office. 
This past February, the National 
Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin 
stated: ‘‘Threats directed at histori-
cally Black colleges and universities 
and other colleges and universities, 
Jewish facilities, and churches cause 
concern and may inspire extremist 
threat actors to mobilize to violence.’’ 
b 1500 
With each passing day, the list of po-
tential targets for mass violence seems 
to expand, and FEMA has already told 
us that even with funding for the pro-
gram increasing roughly three-fold in 
just a few short years, the demand for 
funding is still outpacing available 
funding. The additional resources pro-
vided under my bill will help FEMA do 
more to help more at-risk nonprofits. 
Importantly, 
H.R. 
6825 
requires 
FEMA to provide outreach, engage-
ment, and technical support to non-
profits, with particular attention to el-
igible at-risk nonprofits in underserved 
communities. 
As was mentioned before, in recent 
days, questions have arisen about how 
FEMA plans to bring new at-risk non-
profits into the program, a goal that 
many of us support. 
I strongly believe that with the en-
hanced funding that Congress provides 
in this year’s appropriations, FEMA 
can expand the program’s reach while 
preserving funding to existing grantees 
that continue to be at risk. 
To that end, together with my col-
league, Mr. PASCRELL, I am engaging 
FEMA about its approach, and I look 
forward to resolving it. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to my 
colleagues’ support in passing this crit-
ical legislation. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, back home in New Jer-
sey, I make a point of checking in on 
faith communities as often as I can. We 
gather together, we talk about the 
issues of the day, we talk about how 
their members can help the community 
at large. And in every one of these con-
versations, I am sad to say, the issue of 
security comes up. We talk about this 
grant program and how it can help 
them protect themselves. 
It saddens me because I know that 
bulletproof glass is not the solution to 
hatred. Security guards and security 
cameras are not the solution to the vi-
olence that is plaguing our society. Se-
curity at the point of the religious in-
stitution is not the solution, it is the 
last resort. And yet, it is something 
that we have to do. Until we defeat the 
hatred, until we deal with how it 
spreads through our society, we have 
to harden our institutions so people 
can worship and gather peacefully in 
safety. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle in support of a bill that addresses 
this need, H.R. 6825, the Nonprofit Se-
curity Grant Program Improvement 
Act. It is a timely measure that is re-
sponsive to the current threat picture. 
Instances of anti-Semitic crime, for 
example, hit an all-time high in 2021 in 
America. My home State of New Jersey 
and the neighboring State of New 
York, accounted for nearly 30 percent 
of the reported total. 
The bill is endorsed by The Jewish 
Federations of North America, the 
Anti-Defamation League, the Sikh Co-
alition, the Secure Community Net-
work, the Union of Orthodox Jewish 
Congregations of America, and The Na-
tional Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. 
Just today, ahead of consideration of 
the bill, The Jewish Federations of 
North America reached out to say: 
‘‘The Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram is critically important to the 
safety and security of faith commu-
nities and others who are at risk. The 
Jewish 
Federations 
would 
like 
to

authorization bill that will strengthen 
the Nonprofit Security Grant Program 
and increase much-needed funding for 
at-risk institutions.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, 
while it is not enough, I do strongly be-
lieve that enactment of H.R. 6825 will 
position this program to be effective in 
the future. It will enable us to provide 
these essential grants to every faith in-
stitution that needs them. 
None of us want to communicate to 
folks in our district that we were able 
to help this synagogue, this mosque, 
this church, but the one across the 
street, the one in a different neighbor-
hood, we are sorry, we can’t help you 
because we ran out of money. That is 
absolutely unacceptable, and we are 
going to solve this program.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support 
of H.R. 6871, the DHS Acquisition Re-
form Act. The Committee on Homeland 
Security has examined for several 
years the Department of Homeland Se-
curity’s challenges in managing its ac-
quisition programs. 
The Department uses its acquisition 
system to carry out its critical mis-
sions, such as screening travelers, cy-
bersecurity, border security, and dis-
aster response. 
In 2016, the Government Account-
ability Office reported that one-third 
of the DHS major acquisition programs 
it reviewed experienced cost overruns 
and schedule delays, increasing costs 
by $1.7 billion. And just last year, GAO 
reported that 10 of the Department’s 24 
programs that it reviewed had failed to 
meet their cost or schedule targets 
during fiscal year 2020. 
To address DHS’ acquisition chal-
lenges, H.R. 6871 would centralize over-
sight of the Department’s portfolios of 
acquisition programs to guard against 
waste. The bill designates the Under 
Secretary for Management as the De-
partment’s chief acquisition officer and 
authorizes related oversight respon-
sibilities for other key officials. 
Under this act, the chief acquisition 
officer is charged with advising the 
Secretary of Homeland Security re-
garding acquisition activities that in-
corporate widely accepted program 
management best practices and stand-
ards. 
H.R. 6871 establishes an Office of Test 
and Evaluation to provide oversight of 
test and evaluation activities for major 
acquisition programs to ensure that 
those programs meet operational re-
quirements. Additionally, the bill es-
tablishes a Program Accountability 
and Risk Management Office to iden-
tify problems with cost, schedule, or 
performance that may need to be ad-
dressed 
to 
prevent 
cost 
overruns, 
schedule delays, or performance issues. 
The increased oversight provided in 
the DHS Acquisition Reform Act will 
help the Department to manage its 
major acquisitions more effectively. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I proudly rise in 
support of my bill, H.R. 6871, the DHS 
Acquisition Reform Act. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has many critical missions, includ-
ing: protecting the Nation from ter-
rorist attacks, enforcing our trade and 
immigration laws, and securing our 
borders, among many others. 
The goal of this legislation is to 
make DHS a better steward of taxpayer 
money. We need to ensure that tax-
payer dollars are spent in a way that is 
transparent and accountable to the 
American people. DHS continues to 
face challenges in its acquisition pro-
gram, such as the inconsistency of or-
ganizational and oversight structures, 
and variability in the application of 
Department policies. 
In January 2021, the Government Ac-
countability Office reported that of the 
24 acquisition programs it audited, 10 
had been in breach of their cost goals, 
schedule goals, or a combination of 
both, at some point during fiscal year 
2020. This means it will cost the De-
partment—and subsequently, the tax-
payer—more money to get what the 
Department needs. We need to do what 
we can to stop this. 
Further, in 2018, the inspector gen-
eral reported that DHS components 
have a habit of acquiring goods and 
services before they adequately define 
the requirements or develop perform-
ance measures. The more DHS tacitly 
accepts this type of behavior in its pro-
grams, the more program costs can be 
expected to grow. 
Given these challenges, and the sig-
nificant level of DHS investment in 
these programs, it is vital we ensure 
that the proper oversight and organiza-
tional structures are in place for DHS 
to acquire goods and services in the 
most efficient and effective way pos-
sible. 
This bill designates the DHS Under 
Secretary for Management as the De-
partment’s chief acquisition officer, or 
CAO, and outlines specific responsibil-
ities and authorities regarding acquisi-
tions. 
These responsibilities include over-
seeing the DHS Acquisition Review 
Board; exercising acquisition decision 
authority to approve, modify, or cancel 
acquisition programs; and establishing 
and distributing policies regarding ac-
quisitions. 
The bill also lays out in statute two 
critical offices at DHS: The Office of 
Test and Evaluation and its responsi-
bility to oversee independent testing of 
acquisition programs, and the Program 
Accountability and Risk Management 
Office and its role in DHS acquisitions. 
In addition, the bill describes the ac-
quisition responsibilities of other sen-
ior DHS leaders, including: the chief fi-
nancial officer, the chief information 
officer, and the Under Secretary of 
Strategy, Policy, and Plans. 
This bill will ensure that DHS has 
the appropriate mechanisms in place to 
succeed and will make its acquisition 
process open and transparent to the 
American taxpayer. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
Mr. TORRES, for cosponsoring this 
measure, as well as Ranking Member 
KATKO
and Chairman THOMPSON
for 
bringing it to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 6871, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6871 will help en-
sure that DHS acquisition programs re-
main on budget and on schedule while 
meeting performance requirements. 
In committee, this measure, intro-
duced by my colleague from Kansas, 
Mr. LATURNER, received strong bipar-
tisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6871, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6871. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cybersecurity 
Grants for Schools Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. STRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY EDU-
CATION SUPPORT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2220 of the Home-
land Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 665f) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsection: 
‘‘(e) 
GRANTS

gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, whenever you talk to 
experts working in cybersecurity, one 
of the first priorities they emphasize is 
how important it is to address the 
shortage of trained cybersecurity pro-
fessionals. We can invest in the latest 
technology, but if we don’t have the 
talent 
to 
implement 
cybersecurity 
practices, we will be left vulnerable. 
There are many programs in the Fed-
eral Government designed to help ad-
dress this problem, but one particu-
larly essential one is the Cybersecurity 
Education 
and 
Training 
Assistance 
Program, 
or 
CETAP. 
Operated 
by 
DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastruc-
ture Security Agency, CETAP supports 
K–12 cybersecurity education across 
the country. 
H.R. 6868 will strengthen this exist-
ing program by giving CISA the au-
thority to provide grants to State and 
local governments, colleges and univer-
sities, and nonprofit organizations to 
carry out the program and help address 
the shortage of cybersecurity profes-
sionals in the United States. 
The bill also includes an important 
amendment from Representative JACK-
SON Lee to ensure that CISA reports to 
Congress on how these grants are sup-
porting the cybersecurity education of 
women and underrepresented commu-
nities. 
b 1515 
As we address our cyber workforce 
challenges, we must make sure that no 
groups are excluded from that effort. 
I thank the sponsors of H.R. 6868, 
Representatives GARBARINO and TITUS, 
for their work on this bill. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6868, 
the Cybersecurity Grants for Schools 
Act of 2022. 
Last year, cybersecurity authorities 
observed 
incidents 
involving 
ransomware in nearly every critical in-
frastructure sector. Given the rise of 
cyber threats to our country, it is more 
important now than ever that we grow 
an expert cyber workforce capable of 
defending Americans against nation- 
state actors, criminals, and other mali-
cious cyber actors. 
Research estimates a deficit of 3.1 
million skilled cybersecurity profes-
sionals needed to perform this work 
and keep our country safe. There is a 
multitude of issues contributing to our 
cyber workforce shortage, which is par-
ticularly acute in the Federal sector. 
Lack of exposure, uneven education, 
and Federal agency onboarding issues 
all exacerbate the problem. 
This is why it is more critical than 
ever to support efforts that deliver cy-
bersecurity, STEM, and other com-
puter science curricula and resources 
to our K–12 educators. 
The Cybersecurity Grants for Schools 
Act of 2022 enables the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or 
CISA, to award grants or other finan-
cial assistance for cybersecurity and 
infrastructure security training and 
education programs at the elementary 
and secondary education levels. The 
ability to offer financial support for 
this cyber training will enhance cyber-
security education to bolster the coun-
try’s next generation of cybersecurity 
professionals. 
I thank my colleague on the Home-
land Security Committee, Representa-
tive GARBARINO, for his consistent lead-
ership on cybersecurity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 6868, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, expanding access to cy-
bersecurity 
education 
in 
our 
K–12 
schools will develop the next genera-
tion of cybersecurity professionals who 
have the knowledge needed to protect 
us in today’s connected world. 
CETAP has shown great success in 
addressing this challenge, and this bill 
will help us build on that progress. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
6868, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6868, as

SEC. 3. REPORT ON CYBERSECURITY ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPART-
MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination 
with the Director of the Cybersecurity and In-
frastructure Security Agency of the Department 
of Homeland Security, shall submit to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
Senate a report on the roles and responsibilities 
of the Department and its components relating 
to cyber incident response. 
(b) CONTENTS.—The report required under 
subsection (a) shall include the following: 
(1) A review of how the cyber incident re-
sponse plans under section 2210(c) of the Home-
land Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 660(c)) are 
utilized in the Federal Government’s response to

rity and its components with responsibility for, 
or in support of, the Federal Government’s re-
sponse to a cyber incident, including primary 
responsibility for working with impacted private 
sector entities. 
(3) An explanation of which and how authori-
ties of the Department and its components are 
utilized in the Federal Government’s response to 
a cyber incident. 
(4) Recommendations to provide further clar-
ity for roles and responsibilities of the Depart-
ment and its components relating to cyber inci-
dent response. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, given the magnitude 
and complexity of the current cyberse-
curity threat landscape, coordination 
among DHS components to address 
growing and evolving risks in cyberse-
curity is critical. It is important that 
DHS components coordinate in a man-
ner that reflects how their respective 
expertise can fit into the broader DHS 
cybersecurity strategy. 
While the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency has the 
most notable role in cybersecurity at 
DHS, other components also have con-
siderable cyber expertise. 
For example, the Secret Service has 
a 
critical 
role 
in 
investigating 
cybercrimes, and the Transportation 
Security Administration and the Coast 
Guard provide cybersecurity support 
for the transportation sector. 
As DHS develops its cybersecurity 
strategy and incident response plan-
ning, it must consider how best to use 
each of these components and must 
carefully define roles and responsibil-
ities so that components understand 
their duties during a cyber incident. 
To that end, H.R. 5658 directs DHS to 
provide a report to Congress that ex-
plains the roles and responsibilities of 
its components in cyber incident re-
sponse. The report is to include infor-
mation on how DHS’ authorities and 
CISA’s incident response plans are uti-
lized in the Federal Government’s over-
all cyber incident response efforts. 
This report will help ensure that 
DHS is developing a coordinated effort 
to provide Congress critical informa-
tion regarding the authorities needed 
to facilitate effective cyber incident re-
sponse. 
I thank Representative BACON
for 
collaborating with the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5658, 
the DHS Roles and Responsibilities in 
Cyber Space Act. 
Many recent cyber events, to include 
the Russian probing of U.S. critical in-
frastructure, have shown that enhanc-
ing the security and resilience of our 
critical infrastructure must be a top 
priority for Congress and for the Na-
tion. 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, or CISA, is the lead 
Federal Agency for asset response dur-
ing a significant cyber incident, as di-
rected by Presidential Policy Directive 
41. CISA is also the lead Federal coor-
dinator for securing critical infrastruc-
ture across all 16 sectors, in coordina-
tion with designated sector risk man-
agement agencies. 
This bill outlines specific reporting 
requirements that DHS, in concert 
with CISA, must submit to Congress. 
These requirements include: review of 
utilization of Federal cyber incident 
response plans; explanation of roles 
and responsibilities of DHS in the Fed-
eral Government’s response to a cyber 
incident; explanation of DHS authori-
ties and how its components respond to 
a cyber incident; and recommendations 
to provide further clarity on roles and 
responsibilities of DHS in cyber inci-
dent response. 
This bill will help clarify Federal 
roles in cyber incident response, there-
by eliminating confusion in the midst 
of an actual cyber event. 
I thank the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON) for sponsoring this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 5658, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in recent years, we have 
seen several cyber incidents that have 
demonstrated the importance of effec-
tive incident response planning. 
With 
cyber 
incidents 
occurring 
across many sectors, DHS plays a 
unique role as the lead Federal coordi-
nator for securing critical infrastruc-
ture. Passing this bill will help ensure 
that DHS and its components have the 
properly defined roles and responsibil-
ities necessary to carry out this mis-
sion effectively. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
5658. I am sure we all look forward to 
spending quality time together as we 
do roll call votes on all of these non-
controversial, 
bipartisan 
bills 
this 
week, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5658, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

ing the item relating to section 531 and in-
serting the following new item:

partment property.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 3527. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 3527, a com-
monsense piece of legislation intro-
duced by the chairman of the Senate 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee, 
JON 
TESTER. 
The purpose of this bill is to ensure 
the Secretary has the authority to 
transfer the name of a facility to an-
other physical property should VA de-
cide it needs to relocate the facility. 
Such a relocation could occur if there 
is a need to increase clinic space or to 
move a facility closer to the veteran 
population. 
I hope my colleagues see the benefit 
of such authority and will join me in 
supporting this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
3527. 
When Congress acts to name a VA 
medical facility in law, the name 
should stay with that facility even if it 
moves to another location in the same 
area. That is common sense, and it is 
what this bill would allow. 
A lot of thought and hard work goes 
into honoring a veteran or other indi-
vidual by naming a VA facility after 
them. The person who is honored this 
way often has a storied history that be-
comes 
important 
to 
the 
veterans 
served by that facility. That should not 
be taken away, and it should not be 
taken lightly. 
I am grateful to Senator TESTER for 
his work on this legislation. I urge all 
of my colleagues to join in supporting 
this bill today, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing S. 
3527, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3527. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

May 16, 2022 
Oahu will stand as a lasting testimony 
to his commitment to the men and 
women of the Armed Forces, providing 
countless services and benefits to our 
Nation’s veterans for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive KAI KAHELE, whose constituency 
includes parts of Oahu, for leading this 
effort on the House side. He grew up 
the son of a Native Hawaiian mother 
and a father of Chinese and Native Ha-
waiian heritage. As a student of Kame-
hameha, a high school for boys, a mili-
tary school, Senator Akaka’s path was 
forever changed after having witnessed 
firsthand Japanese fighter planes at-
tacking Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
Like most patriotic Americans dur-
ing World War II, Senator Akaka want-
ed to join in the U.S. effort to defend 
our freedom. He ultimately ended up 
joining the Army Corps of Engineers 
and served throughout the Pacific the-
ater. 
After the war, Senator Akaka took 
advantage of the GI Bill benefits, and 
earned both his bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees from the University of Hawaii. 
After working several years in State 
government, Akaka was persuaded to 
enter elected office to ensure there 
would be a Native Hawaiian presence in 
his State’s decisionmaking process. 
Elected to the House of Representa-
tives in 1977, Daniel Akaka became a 
congressional champion of indigenous 
and veteran issues. In 1990, he was 
elected to represent Hawaii in the 
United States Senate. 
Thanks to Senator Akaka’s commit-
ment to recognizing the military con-
tributions of the AAPI community, 
more than 30 Medals of Honor were 
awarded to Asian and Asian-American 
World War II veterans; a recognition of 
their patriotism and bravery that was 
long overdue. 
When it comes to the question of 
naming the VA community-based out-
patient clinic in Hawaii, I ask this 
body: Who better than Daniel Kahikina 
Akaka; a Hawaiian-born, Hawaiian- 
serving veteran whose life philosophy 
was sharing aloha and was a true pub-
lic servant for over three decades. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support from our colleagues 
in the Hawaiian Congressional Delega-
tion, the American Legion, the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, and the Dis-
abled American Veterans. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2021. 
Hon. JON TESTER, 
Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JERRY MORAN, 
Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN TESTER AND RANKING MEM-
BER MORAN: We, the Hawaii Congressional 
Delegation, write in support of legislation to 
designate the planned outpatient clinic on 
the Island of Oahu, Hawaii as the ‘‘Daniel 
Kahikina Akaka Department of Veteran Af-
fairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic,’’ 
to honor and commemorate Senator Daniel 
Akaka’s service to his country during World 
War II and his service to the people of Ha-
waii in Congress. 
Born in 1924 in Honolulu, Hawaii, Senator 
Akaka attended public grade school, but 
went to Kamehameha School for Boys and 
graduated from there in 1942. From 1943 to 
1945, after graduating from high school, he 
served as a civilian worker in the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers. He continued to serve in 
the Army Corps of Engineers after being 
drafted in 1945, including assignments on 
Saipan and Tinian, until being honorably 
discharged in 1947. 
He returned to Hawaii and pursued his edu-
cation at the University of Hawaii utilizing 
the GI Bill. He spent 15 years as an educator 
and administrator in public schools before 
transitioning into government service. Dur-
ing his time in government, he was the Chief 
Program Planner for the Hawaii Department 
of Education, Director of the Hawaii Office 
of Economic Opportunity, Director of the 
Progressive Neighborhood Program, and Spe-
cial Assistant in the Office of Governor 
George Ariyoshi. 
Senator Akaka was first elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, where 
he represented the people of Hawaii for 14 
years. In 1990, he was appointed to fill a Sen-
ate vacancy after the death of Senator Spark 
M. Matsunaga. He was elected to the seat 
that fall and continued to serve as Senator 
for 23 years until his retirement in 2013. Sen-
ator Akaka was the first U.S. Senator of Na-
tive Hawaiian ancestry, and during his ten-
ure was the only Chinese-American member 
of the Senate. 
Senator Akaka was a member of the Sen-
ate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC) 
from 1990 through 2013, and was the chairman 
of the committee from 2007 to 2011. During 
his tenure, he expanded benefits for veterans 
and worked to ensure those who had served 
our country were properly recognized for 
that service. 
Mr. Akaka sponsored legislation in 1996 to 
review the service records of Asian-Ameri-
cans who had fought in the 442nd Regimental 
Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Bat-
talion during World War II. The review re-
sulted in over 30 Medals of Honor being be-
latedly bestowed, some posthumously, on 
Asian-American veterans. Many of these vet-
erans were of Japanese heritage, and in-
cluded his fellow Senator from Hawaii, Dan-
iel K. Inouye. 
As chairman, in 2008, he oversaw the larg-
est increase ever in funding for the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA). At the time, 
he said it was important to ensure VA had 
the funding needed to respond to veterans’ 
needs. He said at the time, ‘‘as the ongoing 
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan continue, 
we must recognize that care for those 
wounded in combat is part of the cost of 
war.’’ 
In his farewell speech, Senator Akaka 
credited the GI bill with saving him from 
some of the effects of PTSD after returning 
from the war, saying he ‘‘would not be stand-
ing before you today without the oppor-
tunity the GI bill gave me, not only to get an 
education but to have structure and a path 
forward.’’ As chairman of SVAC, he worked 
with Senator Jim Webb to pass the Post 9/11 
Veterans Educational Assistance Act to up-
date and expand GI Benefits so that Iraq and 
Afghanistan war veterans had the same op-
portunities he was once afforded. 
Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye pur-
sued legislation to provide one-time com-
pensation for members of the Phillippine 
Scouts, an American-led unit of mostly Fili-
pino and Filipino-American recruits who 
fought alongside United States troops but 
did not qualify for Veterans Administration 
benefits. The Senators successfully secured 
the funding for this compensation in the 2009 
stimulus bill. 
While much of what Senator Akaka accom-
plished benefitted veterans across the coun-
try, he never stopped advocating for the Na-
tive Hawaiian veteran community. Using his 
roles on both SVAC and the Senate Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, he highlighted the 
unique challenges faced by Native Hawaiian 
veterans, including holding a field hearing in 
Hawaii in 2006 in which these specific issues 
were discussed. 
The Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of 
Veteran 
Affairs 
Community-Based 
Out-
patient Clinic is an appropriate and a mean-
ingful way to honor Senator Akaka’s life-
time of service to his country and to the peo-
ple of Hawaii and continue his legacy on be-
half of veterans. Senator Akaka in his fare-
well speech to Congress speak volumes as to 
his commitment to veterans: 
‘‘I want to take this moment to urge all of 
my colleagues and all of the incoming Sen-
ators and Representatives to do everything 
they can for our veterans and their families 
because we ask them to sacrifice so much for 
us. They put their lives on the line while 
their wives and husbands watch over their 
families. Caring for them is one of our most 
sacred obligations as a nation.’’ 
Legislation to name the clinic has been in-
troduced in the Senate (S. 1760) with a com-
panion measure introduced in the House 
(H.R. 3406). with the full support of Hawaii 
Congressional delegation. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
legislation. 
Sincerely, 
MAZIE K. HIRONO, 
U.S. Senator.

THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
DEPARTMENT OF HAWAII, 
Honolulu, HI, October 20, 2021. 
Subject: The proposed legislation to rename 
the Ewa Plain VA Outpatient Clinic 
(CBOC) the DANIEL KAHIKINA AKAKA 
VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). 
The American Legion Department of Ha-
waii fully supports legislation proposed by 
Hawaii US Senator Mazie Hirono to rename 
the Ewa Plain VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) 
the DANIEL KAHIKINA AKAKA VA Out-
patient Clinic (CBOC) after the late US Sen-
ator Daniel Akaka. 
Senator Akaka was a military veteran who 
served honorably in the US Army from 1945– 
1947 in Saipan and Tinian during World War 
II. Following military service, he returned to 
Hawaii to attend college, then pursued a ca-
reer of teaching. Eventually he entered poli-
tics, first as a US Congressman where he 
served his Hawaiian constituents for seven 
terms. Following Hawaii’s US Senator Mat-
sunaga’s death, he was appointed to fill his 
vacancy in US Senate. Senator Akaka then 
served successfully in the US Senate for 
three more terms. As Hawaii’s junior US 
Senator, he served on the US Senate’s Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs and on the US Sen-
ate’s Committee on Veterans Affairs. Two of 
the more prominent legislation that he 
championed and saw passed were: spear-
heading awarding nearly 2 dozen Medals of 
Honor to soldiers of the famous World War II 
442nd/100th ‘‘Go for Broke’’ Battalion; and 
passing legislation authorizing World War II 
Philippine Scouts just compensation for de-
nied veterans benefits. 
US Senator Akaka was a true pioneer, the 
first native Hawaiian to serve in the US Sen-
ate. He was also a military veteran who 
would take care of veterans while serving in 
the Senate. It is only appropriate that the 
Ewa Plain VA Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) be

VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS, 
DEPARTMENT OF HAWAII, 
Honolulu, HI, April 6, 2021. 
Hon. MAZIE HIRONO, 
U.S. Senator, the State of Hawaii, 
Washington DC. 
ALOHA SENATOR HIRONO: The Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, Department of Hawaii, is writ-
ing to support your legislation to name the 
ALOHA Project VA Clinic the ‘‘Department 
of Veterans Affairs Daniel Kahikina Akaka 
Community-Based Outpatient Clinic’’. We 
support this effort to celebrate our fellow 
veteran for his service in WWII and his serv-
ice as the first Native Hawaiian to serve in 
the U.S. Senate. 
During his twenty-three years on the Com-
mittee of Veterans Affairs and also serving 
as Chairman from 2007 to 2011, Senator 
Akaka sponsored legislation expanding bene-
fits, 
increasing 
funding 
for 
veteran 
healthcare, and ensuring proper recognition 
for our comrades who served, especially for 
those who had served in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. This included ensuring that the VA 
handles both PTSD and TBI claims with the 
respect they deserved and expanding the GI 
Bill. 
In 1996 he cosponsored legislation that re-
viewed the records of Asian-Americans in-
cluding Hawaii’s own 442nd Regimental Com-
bat Team and the 110th Infantry Battalion 
for action seen during WWII. As a result, 
many heroic actions were properly recog-
nized. This included thirty Medals of Honor, 
including for his fellow Senator from Hawaii, 
Daniel K. Inouye. 
Before leaving office, Senator Akaka initi-
ated the VA Aloha Project legislation. We 
believe that is fitting and pono to name this 
clinic after him. This action will ensure that 
his honor and his dedication to veterans will 
be remembered for generations to come. We 
respectfully request that the Senate Vet-
erans Affairs Committee quickly consider 
this important legislation.

DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS, 
DEPARTMENT OF HAWAII, 
Honolulu, HI, May 18, 2021. 
Re Support for Renaming the Department of 
Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Ewa 
Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, as the Daniel 
Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans 
Affairs Outpatient Clinic. 
Ms. Hirono plans to introduce the fol-
lowing bill: which is expected to be referred 
to the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs: A BILL To name the Department of 
Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Ewa 
Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, as the Daniel Kahikina 
Akaka 
Department 
of 
Veterans 
Affairs 
CommunityBased Outpatient Clinic. 
The Disabled Americans Veterans, Depart-
ment of Hawaii is writing this letter in sup-
port of legislation introduced by Ms. Hirono. 
The proposed legislation would name the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinic in 
Ewa Plain, Hawaii after Senator Daniel 
Kahikina Akaka. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs out-
patient clinic in Ewa Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, 
shall after the date of the enactment of this 
Act be known and designated as the Daniel 
Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic. 
Any reference to such outpatient clinic in 
any law, regulation, map, document, record, 
or other paper of the United States shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Daniel 
Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic. 
During World War II Senator Akaka served 
in the United States Army Corps of Engi-
neers, including service on Saipan and 
Tinian. He served from 1945 to 1947. 
Akaka was appointed by Governor John 
Waihee to the U.S. Senate in April 1990 to 
serve temporarily after the death of Senator 
Spark Matsunaga. During his tenure, Akaka 
served as the Chair of the United States Sen-
ate Committee on Indian Affairs and the 
United States Senate Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. 
He attended his final session in the Senate 
on December 12, 2012. He closed his speech 
with a traditional Hawaiian farewell, ‘‘a hui 
hou’’ (until we meet again). 
Former president Barack Obama remem-
bered Akaka as ‘‘a tireless advocate for 
working people, veterans, native Hawaiian 
rights, and the people of Hawaii . . . He em-
bodied the aloha spirit with compassion and 
care.’’ 
Akaka died of organ failure in the early 
hours of April 6, 2018, at the age of 93. 
Sincerly, 
GREGORRIO ALIP, 
Department Comander. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support S. 1760, to des-
ignate the soon-to-be-constructed VA 
community-based outpatient clinic in 
Oahu, Hawaii, after our friend and 
former 
colleague, 
Daniel 
Kahikina 
Akaka. In doing so, this body will ap-
propriately commemorate the signifi-
cant achievements of America’s first 
Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1760, a bill to name the VA com-
munity-based 
outpatient 
clinic 
in 
Oahu, Hawaii, after World War II vet-
eran and former Hawaiian Senator, 
Daniel Akaka. 
Senator Akaka has a long and proud 
record of service in a uniform and out. 
Following his time in the Army, he 
represented his fellow Hawaiians in 
both the House and the Senate. During 
that time in the Senate, he served as 
chairman of the Veterans Affairs’ Com-
mittee, where he also represented his 
fellow veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting that 
the community-based outpatient clinic 
in his hometown of Oahu be named in 
his honor. I am proud to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE), 
who serves on the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to join my colleagues, including my 
colleagues kindly speaking here today 
from Maryland and Illinois, in strong 
support of House passage of S. 1760, in-
troduced by my colleague Senator 
MAZIE HIRONO, and passed unanimously 
by the Senate. 
This critical measure, companion 
legislation to H.R. 3406, which I co-in-
troduced in the House with its prin-
cipal sponsor, my colleague and part-
ner, Congressman KAIALI’I KAHELE, will 
designate the new community-based 
outpatient clinic of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, now literally rising 
out of the ground at Kalaeloa in Ha-
waii, and known to date as the Ad-
vanced Leeward Outpatient Healthcare 
Access, or ALOHA project, as the Dan-
iel Kahikina Akaka Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs 
Community-Based 
Outpatient Clinic. 
Daniel K. Akaka was many things 
throughout his long and full 93 years of 
life: teacher, Member of this House 
from 1977 to 1991, the first U.S. Senator 
of Native Hawaiian ancestry from 1991 
to 2012, beloved mentor to generations, 
and on and on. Of all of these, he was 
a deeply proud veteran, having served 
in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 
the Second World War, deploying to 
the Western Pacific in support of the 
critical 
island-hopping 
campaign, 
which won the Pacific war. 
Senator Akaka carried his pride and 
passion and commitment to our Na-
tion’s veterans into his work in Con-
gress. As member and chair of the U.S. 
Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, he produced an unmatched record 
of progress on healthcare, compensa-
tion, and other benefits for veterans, 
including crafting the new veterans’ GI 
Bill in Congress to ensure more edu-
cation benefits for veterans of Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
In this Asian-Pacific Heritage Month, 
it is fitting to recognize his work fo-
cusing on specific issues affecting our 
Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and 
Pacific Islander veterans. 
The 
importance 
of 
the 
ALOHA 
project to our veteran ‘ohana, or fam-
ily, throughout Hawaii and the Pacific 
cannot be overstated. On its projected 
completion in late 2023, it will bring 
our VA healthcare system to our vet-
erans, relieving significant and grow-
ing pressure in Hawaii on that system, 
increasing healthcare access for Ha-
waii’s over 110,000 veterans and more, 
and alleviating significant and growing 
logistical and capacity challenges at 
Tripler Army Medical Center and the 
Spark M. Matsunaga Medical Center. 
I cannot think of a more deserving 
and appropriate individual to grace 
this facility and those who work and 
are healed there with his name and his 
still living, breathing spirit, than Dan-
iel Kahikina Akaka. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
measure so that it may be sent directly 
to the President for his consideration 
and enactment. 
‘‘Mahalo nui loa.’’ ‘‘Thank you very 
much.’’ 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

COL. GAIL S. HALVORSEN ‘‘CANDY 
BOMBER’’ VETERANS CENTER 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
2514) to rename the Provo Veterans 
Center in Orem, Utah, as the ‘‘Col. Gail 
S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans 
Center’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2514 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE COL. GAIL S. 
HALVORSEN ‘‘CANDY BOMBER’’ VET-
ERANS CENTER. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Gail Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, on October 10, 1920, and spent his 
youth with his family on small farms in 
Utah and Idaho. 
(2) After a brief stint at Utah State Univer-
sity, Gail Halvorsen joined the Civilian Pilot 
Training Program where he earned his pi-
lot’s license in 1941. During that same year, 
Halvorsen joined the Civil Air Patrol as a 
pilot. 
(3) Gail Halvorsen joined the United States 
Army Air Corps in 1942 and trained flying 
fighter jets with the Royal Air Force. Upon 
his return from training, he was assigned to 
fly transport missions in the South Atlantic 
Theater. 
(4) After World War II and the division of 
Berlin into occupation zones, disputes broke 
out between the Western Allies and the So-
viet Union over the future of Europe. 
(5) Negotiations deteriorated, and in June 
of 1948 Soviet forces locked down all land 
routes connecting Western Germany with 
the allied portions of Berlin. Approximately 
2,000,000 people in West Berlin were left com-
pletely isolated. Starvation, poverty, and 
desperate want ensued. 
(6) In an effort to alleviate the immense 
human suffering, the allies decided to drop 
supplies to people of West Berlin from the air 
until a diplomatic solution to the blockade 
could be reached. Termed by United States 
forces ‘‘Operation Vittles’’, the Berlin Airlift 
began on June 26, 1948. 
(7) Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Ger-
many in 1948 to work as an airlift pilot 
where he flew C–47 and C–54 cargo planes as 
part of Operation Vittles. 
(8) While on mission at Tempelhof Airport 
in Berlin, Halvorsen noticed a group of Ger-
man children standing just outside the barb 
wire fence. 
(9) The children were destitute and clearly 
had very little to eat. Halvorsen gave the 
children two sticks of gum he had in his 
pocket, which they split into little pieces to 
share among themselves. 
(10) Colonel Halvorsen was deeply affected 
by the experience and wanted to do more to 
help. He promised the children he would drop 
more candy to them from his plane as he 
flew his regular airlift missions. 
(11) Halvorsen told the children they would 
recognize his plane by a back-and-forth wag-
gle of his wings as he flew over. 
(12) Colonel Halvorsen enlisted his copilot 
and engineer in the project and began at-
taching their candy rations to miniature 
parachutes which they dropped from their 
plane to the starving children below. 
(13) The children of Berlin gave Halvorsen 
many nicknames including ‘‘Uncle Wiggly 
Wings’’, ‘‘The Chocolate Flier’’, ‘‘The Gum 
Drop Kid’’, and ‘‘The Chocolate Uncle’’. He 
eventually became known around the world 
as ‘‘The Candy Bomber’’. 
(14) Lieutenant General William H. Turner, 
who directed the Berlin Airlift, learned 
about Halvorsen’s efforts and officially ex-
panded the idea into a full-blown operation 
known as ‘‘Little Vittles’’ as a play on the 
broader operation’s name. 
(15) As the candy drops continued, word of 
Operation Little Vittles reached the United 
States. Families, schoolchildren, and candy-
makers in the United States began contrib-
uting candy and homemade parachutes that 
Halvorsen and other pilots could drop. 
(16) When the Berlin Airlift ended, an esti-
mated 250,000 parachutes containing approxi-
mately 21 tons of candy had been dropped by 
Halvorsen and his fellow airmen as a part of 
Operation Little Vittles. 
(17) Halvorsen retired from the military in 
1974 after 31 years of service and more than 
8,000 hours of flying time. 
(18) Since his retirement, Halvorson has 
continued his humanitarian service. He has 
voluntarily represented the United States 
Air Force and the United States abroad and 
has re-enacted his famous candy drops sev-
eral times in Berlin and around the world. 
(19) Halvorsen has also been a tremendous 
boon to his community through church serv-
ice and other local contributions. 
(20) Gail Halvorsen turned 100 years old on 
October 10, 2020. 
(b) DESIGNATION.—The Provo Veterans Cen-
ter of the Department of Veterans Affairs lo-
cated at 360 State Street, Orem, Utah, shall 
after the date of the enactment of this Act 
be known and designated as the ‘‘Col. Gail S. 
Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center’’. 
(c) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the veterans 
center referred to in subsection (b) shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Col. Gail 
S. Halvorsen ‘‘Candy Bomber’’ Veterans Cen-
ter. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on S. 2514. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my sup-
port for S. 2514, a bill to recognize and 
remember the life of Colonel Gail Sey-
mour Halvorsen, who passed away on 
February 16, 2022, at 101 years old. 
I thank Senator LEE and my col-
leagues from Utah’s congressional dele-
gation for their work to pay tribute to 
Colonel Halvorsen. Colonel Halvorsen 
was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and 
in 1942 he joined the Army Air Corps 
and trained as a fighter pilot. While 
stationed in Germany, where he flew C– 
47 and C–54 cargo planes as part of Op-
eration Vittles; Halvorsen noticed doz-
ens of hunger-starved German children 
outside of the barbed wire fence. Hav-
ing two pieces of gum, Halvorsen broke 
it into strips and gave it to the chil-
dren to share amongst them. Inspired 
by the children’s glee, Halvorsen com-
mitted to more frequently distributing 
candy from his plane to them. 
Earning his nickname ‘‘The Candy 
Bomber,’’ Halvorsen dropped miniature 
parachutes of candy rations in the 
street of Berlin to feed the children. By 
the end of the Berlin Airlift, Halvorsen 
and his fellow airmen distributed an es-
timated 250,000 parachutes with over 20 
tons of candy throughout Operation 
Little Vittles. 
The Provo Vet Center plays a vital 
role in the community and provides 
important services such as counseling 
for veterans with PTSD and confiden-
tial counseling sessions to those who 
have experienced military sexual trau-
ma—all free to the veterans, reservists, 
and members of National Guard—re-
gardless of service connection or VA 
health enrollment status. 
To rename this important vet center 
after Colonel Halvorsen would be a fit-
ting honor for one of the Beehive 
State’s most selfless members of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support from the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, the Disabled American 
Veterans, the American Legion, and a 
letter dated July 28, 2021, from the U.S. 
Senate.

Provo Veterans Center located at 360 South 
State Street Building C 103 in Orem, Utah be 
renamed after Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen, af-
fectionately known as the ‘‘Candy Bomber’’, 
who performed military service of an ex-
traordinarily distinguished character during 
the Berlin Airlift in 1948. 
Halvorsen’s 
creativity 
and 
compassion 
helped to heal the wounds of the Second 
World War and softened the relationship be-
tween an occupied Germany and the United 
States. Col. Halvorsen exemplifies the best 
of our brave veterans who have each dem-
onstrated service before self. 
Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Germany in 
1948 to work as an airlift pilot where he flew 
C–47 and C–54 cargo planes as part of Oper-
ation ‘‘Vittles’’. While on mission at Tem-
pelhof Airport in Berlin, Halvorsen noticed a

When the Berlin airlift ended, an estimated 
250,000 parachutes with 21 tons of candy had 
been dropped by Halvorsen and his fellow air-
men as part of Operation Little Vittles. 
Halvorsen’s candy drops had a significant 
impact on Berliners’ public perception of 
America. He retired from the military in 1974 
after 31 years of service and more than 8,000 
hours of flying time. Since his retirement, 
Halvorsen has continued his humanitarian 
and community service. He has voluntarily 
represented the U.S. Air Force and the 
United States abroad and has re-enacted his 
famous candy drops several times in Berlin, 
the Middle East, and around the world in an 
effort to bring peace and relief. He was 
awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, a 
German Order of Merit, an Air Force Com-
mendation Medal, and a Medal for Humane 
Action. Halvorsen has also been a tremen-
dous boon to his community through his 
church service. 
His non-profit organization, the Gail S. 
Halvorsen Aviation Education Foundation, 
advances 
aviation 
education, 
promotes 
youth 
leadership 
development, 
enhances 
community 
capacity

also provides education by giving free lec-
tures and multimedia presentations on avia-
tion, science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) topics at local schools, 
community groups, and at its own facility at 
the Spanish Fork Airport in Spanish Fork, 
Utah. 
Renaming the Provo Vet Center in Orem, 
Utah after Colonel Halvorsen is a fitting and 
deserved recognition for such an exemplary 
U.S. Air Force veteran and American hero.

DEAR CHAIRMAN TESTER, RANKING MEMBER

ter on behalf of Utah Department of Disabled 
American Veterans, in supporting the rec-
ommendation to change the name of the 
Provo Veterans Center in Orem, Utah to be 
renamed to honor Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen, 
exemplifying his compassion for humanity in 
a time of War. 
Colonel Halverson is one of the focal points 
to our Americanism program here in Utah. 
In our program, we highlight local military 
heroes and their impact in service militarily 
and civically. He makes such an impact on 
our youth when they hear of his compassion 
for the children of a war-torn country. The 
simple act of caring became more than an 
isolated incident. His action locally started 
an action that was heard throughout the 
world. The exposure was so great that Amer-
ican candy companies, children and families 
got involved in supplying candies and home-
made parachutes. 
I have met Col. Halvorson on several occa-
sions. He is a very caring and humble man, 
and not only a local treasure but a National 
Treasure as well. Gail had never thought 
that one simple act could make such an im-
pact on a nation or the world stage. 
Please help us here in Utah and the Nation 
by giving back a little to an American Icon 
and National Treasure in the renaming of 
the Provo Veterans Center to the ‘‘Colonel 
Gail Halverson Veteran Center’’.

Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2514, a bill to rename the Provo 
Veterans Center in Utah after Colonel 
Gail Halvorsen. 
Colonel Halvorsen is a Salt Lake City

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7500. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7500, the Fiscal Year 2022 Vet-
erans Affairs Major Medical Facility 
Authorization Act. 
I thank my colleague from Texas 
(Mr. ALLRED) for his work on this bill. 
I also thank the chairman of the Sen-
ate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sen-
ator TESTER, for introducing the Sen-
ate companion to this important legis-
lation. 
Each year, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs submits an annual budget 
request to Congress, and it is our job to 
authorize and appropriate the funding 
the VA needs to care for America’s vet-
erans and their families. 
Within that larger funding request is 
the VA’s request for funds to replace 
and modernize its medical facilities. 
This year’s major construction re-
quests total just over $3.4 billion. It 
will build a much-needed spinal cord 
injury center in Dallas, Texas; erect a 
new surgical intensive care unit and 
renovate operating rooms in Oklahoma 
City; construct a new critical care cen-
ter in West Los Angeles; and allow for 
the seismic retrofit and renovation of 
buildings in Portland, Oregon, among 
other things. 
Mr. Speaker, this Congress, the com-
mittee has highlighted VA’s aging in-
frastructure. During our oversight ef-
forts, the committee has learned that 
in order to fully recapitalize the De-
partment’s portfolio, the VA would 
need roughly $90 billion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4997 
May 16, 2022 
Delivering 21st century healthcare in 
buildings that were built during the 
latter half of the 19th century is far 
from ideal and certainly not what our 
veterans deserve. 
Given the severity of underfunding as 
it relates to the VA’s capital assets, we 
cannot afford to wait until the AIR 
Commission provides recommendations 
to Congress and the White House, as 
my colleagues across the aisle would 
advocate for. Life-safety and seismic 
issues across the portfolio must be rec-
ognized 
now. 
Regular 
maintenance 
should not be delayed because of budg-
etary concerns, nor should we delay 
retrofitting facilities to meet the VA’s 
fastest-growing population, women vet-
erans, or delay addressing the lessons 
learned from this Nation’s first pan-
demic in more than 100 years. 
If we are going to build back vet-
erans’ trust in the VA, we have to start 
making serious investments in the out-
dated infrastructure meant to serve 
them, 
and 
nearly 
three-fourths 
of 
Americans agree. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support and pass this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7500, the bill that would authorize VA 
major medical facility construction 
projects in Mississippi, New York, 
Texas, 
California, 
Kentucky, 
Okla-
homa, Oregon, and Missouri. 
It is well known that the VA 
healthcare system has very serious in-
frastructure issues. The average VA 
medical center is decades older than 
the average private-sector hospital. 
Authorizing these projects won’t fix 
that, but it will help thousands of vet-
erans who live in those eight States to 
have better access to the care that 
they have earned and deserve. 
I appreciate Congressmen Allred and 
Ellzey for their work introducing this 
important bill. It has my full support 
today. I encourage my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 7500. I yield back the balance of 
my time.

question is on the motion offered by

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

PATIENT ADVOCATE TRACKER 
ACT 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5754) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to improve the ability of 
veterans to electronically submit com-
plaints about the delivery of health 
care services by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5754 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Patient Ad-
vocate Tracker Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION 
OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DELIV-
ERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY 
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
AFFAIRS. 
Section 7309A(c) of title 38, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(3) Beginning not later than 18 months 
after the date of the enactment of this para-
graph, the Director shall establish an infor-
mation technology system that will allow a 
veteran (or the designated representative of 
a veteran) to electronically— 
‘‘(A) file a complaint that will be received 
by the appropriate patient advocate; and 
‘‘(B) at any time view the status of the 
complaint, including interim and final ac-
tions that have been taken to address the 
complaint.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5754. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5754, the Patient Advocate 
Tracker Act, sponsored by the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
This bill will require VA to create a 
system to allow veterans to electroni-
cally submit complaints about the de-
livery of VA healthcare services and to 
track the resolution of those com-
plaints by local VA patient advocates 
through an online system in real time. 
VA’s existing IT system only allows 
VA employees to track complaint reso-
lution, but not patients. 
This bill has garnered the bipartisan 
support of an impressive 115 cosponsors 
since it was introduced 7 months ago. 
H.R. 5754 is also endorsed by numerous 
veterans service organizations, includ-
ing the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Dis-
abled American Veterans, Paralyzed 
Veterans of America, and Student Vet-
erans of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5754, the Patient Advocate Tracker 
Act. This is an excellent piece of legis-
lation that is the brainchild of a vet-
eran named Cameron Zbikowski. 
Cameron worked on VA’s patient ad-
vocate program as a student veteran 
fellow for the VFW and Student Vet-
erans of America. During his fellow-
ship, he recognized that veterans would 
be better served if they could submit 
complaints to VA patient advocates 
online and track the status of those 
complaints online as well. 
Cameron was spot on, and this bill 
will require VA to make that happen. 
This will make patient advocates more 
accessible to veterans than ever before, 
and it will increase the transparency 
and accountability of the VA patient 
advocacy program so that we can make 
sure that it is working as it should for 
veterans across the country. 
I know Cameron is watching today, 
and from one veteran to another, I 
thank him for his great work. 
This bill is sponsored by the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
I thank her for her hard work on this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud supporter 
of this bill today, and I hope that all of 
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting it. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 5754, the Patient Advocate Track-
er Act, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
6604, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak in 
strong support of H.R. 6604, as amend-
ed, the Veterans Eligible to Transfer 
School (VETS) Credit Act. 
This bipartisan legislation is a prod-
uct of work from the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY) that, together, will make it easier 
for veterans and their dependents to 
use their earned benefits. 
Representative BUCHANAN’s legisla-
tion would provide students that qual-
ify a new provisional certificate of eli-
gibility for benefits that may have 
been unfairly lost due to circumstances 
outside of their control. That means if 
a student veteran is left in the unfortu-
nate 
situation 
where 
their 
school 
closes, they will be provided detailed 
information from the VA on how to re-
serve their benefits or have their bene-
fits restored or transferred to a new in-
stitution. 
H.R. 6604, as amended, would also en-
sure that clerical errors don’t rob vet-
erans of transferring their benefits to a 
dependent. Under current law, if a serv-
icemember accidentally makes a mis-
take on their paperwork, such as indi-
cating an expiration date for the bene-
fits, and the servicemember passes 
away before the benefits are used, 
there is no way for the paperwork to be 
changed to allow the dependent to use 
the benefits. 
This bill clarifies existing law and 
ensures that clerical errors do not pre-
vent dependents from receiving edu-
cational assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hard 
work of the members of the committee 
on this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6604, as amended, the Veterans 
Eligible to Transfer School Credit Act. 
This bill, authored by my friend from 
Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN), would help 
student veterans continue to use their 
GI Bill benefits if their school closes in 
the middle of a semester. 
Under current law, when a school 
closes, an eligible student can have 
their GI Bill benefits restored for the 
time they spent attending the shut-
tered school. This bill would stream-
line that process for these students to 
use their restored benefits at a new 
school. This will help student veterans 
quickly transfer to a new school and 
complete their degree using their GI 
Bill benefits. 
H.R. 6604, as amended, also includes 
the text of Congressman MURPHY’s bill, 
H.R. 6458. This bill eliminates the ex-
isting requirement for the servicemem-
ber to set a specific date for when any 
transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits 
would expire. 
b 1600 
Thus, this bill would prevent those 
who are entitled to these benefits from 
accidentally inputting the wrong date. 
These wrong dates have led to de-
pendents being barred from taking ad-
vantage of their education benefits. 
For example, there have been instances 
where a servicemember has put in their 
child’s 18th birthday by accident which 
then prevents the child from using the 
benefit. If the servicemember is alive, 
they can easily change this date in the 
system. However, if the servicemember 
has passed away before they make this 
change, then it is irreversible and the 
child can’t use their GI Bill benefit. 
I thank the Tragedy Assistance Pro-
gram for Survivors, or TAPS, for bring-
ing this transfer issue and solution to 
us. I also thank both Congressman 
BUCHANAN
and Congressman MURPHY 
for their hard work on these bills. I en-
courage all my colleagues to support 
H.R. 6604, as amended, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
BOST for yielding. 
I rise today to advocate for H.R. 6604, 
as amended, the Veterans Eligible to 
Transfer Schools (VETS) Credit Act. It 
corrects issues that veterans are hav-
ing when using their GI benefits when 
transferring schools after a school clo-
sure. The bill also includes provisions 
from my bill, H.R. 6458, which elimi-
nates the requirement to specify an ef-
fective period of a transfer of post-9/11 
educational assistance to a dependent. 
I am grateful to Representative VERN 
BUCHANAN for attaching my bill to H.R. 
6604. 
As Members of Congress, we realize 
the overall importance of the Post-9/11 
GI Bill. It has been a huge success in 
recruiting and retaining servicemem-
bers. Many servicemembers use the 
added benefit of being able to transfer 
their education benefits to their family 
members. With the cost of college edu-
cation so astronomical in this era, 
many servicemembers are using this 
opportunity. 
Under current law servicemembers 
are eligible to transfer their 36 months 
of Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility to their 
dependents if they have served at least 
6 years and incur a service obligation 
to serve an additional 4 years. 
The nonprofit Tragedy Assistance 
Program 
for 
Survivors, 
otherwise 
known as TAPS, has brought to our at-
tention that under current practice if a

servicemember accidentally puts on 
their GI Bill transfer form that the 
benefits for a child or other dependent 
expire on a certain date and the serv-
icemember later dies before the benefit 
is used, there is no way for the record 
to be changed to allow a dependent to 
use the benefit. 
If the veteran were still alive, they 
could go back in the system and 
change the date at any time. TAPS has 
seen this happen to several family 
members and has asked us to look into 
it and try to correct the problem. When 
we contacted the Department of De-
fense to see if they could address this 
with an administrative fix, we were 
told that a legislative correction was 
needed, and this is why we are here 
today to introduce my bill. 
The bill, as amended, includes this 
change that would eliminate the re-
quirement to specify a period of trans-
fer of Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement to a 
dependent. This would prevent those 
entitled to post-9/11 education benefits 
from accidentally inputting the wrong 
date and therefore preventing the de-
pendent from taking advantage of the 
benefit. 
It may seem a small detail, but for 
those individuals it is a very, very 
large benefit. I am grateful to TAPS 
for identifying this issue and grateful 
for Congressman BUCHANAN as well as 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber BOST for their support. I would like 
to thank the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs for their assistance. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
this important piece of legislation, 
H.R. 6604, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage

STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT FOR 
VETERANS ACT OF 2021

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

ening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. TESTIMONIAL SUBPOENA AUTHORITY OF 
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
VETERANS 
AF-
FAIRS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 312 of title 38, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following new subsection: 
‘‘(d)(1)(A) In addition to the authority oth-
erwise provided by the Inspector General Act 
of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) and in accordance with 
the requirements of this subsection, the In-
spector General, in carrying out the provi-
sions of this section, may require by sub-

nesses as necessary in the performance of the 
functions assigned to the Inspector General 
by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

priate district court of the United States. 
‘‘(B) The Inspector General may not re-

‘‘(B) Not later than 10 days after the date 
on which the Attorney General is notified 
pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Attorney

issuance of the subpoena if the subpoena will 
interfere with an ongoing investigation and, 
if the Attorney General makes such an ob-
jection, the Inspector General may not issue 
the subpoena. 
‘‘(C) If the Attorney General does not ob-
ject in writing to the issuance of the sub-

‘‘(B) provide the witness an opportunity to 
attend and testify voluntarily. 
‘‘(5) Whenever requiring by subpoena under

of a witness, the Inspector General shall, to 
the greatest extent practicable, travel to res-
idence of the witness, the principal place of 
business of the witness, or other similar lo-
cation that is in proximity to the residence 
of the witness. 
‘‘(6)(A) Along with each semiannual report 
submitted by the Inspector General pursuant

actment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas). Pursuant to the rule, 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE) and the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. BOST) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S. 2687. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this 
bipartisan 
bill, 
S. 
2687, 
the 
Strengthening Oversight for Veterans 
Act, introduced by Senator TESTER. I 
thank Representative RICE and Dele-
gate Radewagen for introducing the 
House companion to this bill. 
This bill seeks to strengthen the VA 
Office of the Inspector General by 
granting the office testimonial sub-
poena authority, an essential tool for 
conducting oversight. 
Too often, individuals with impor-
tant information relevant to an inves-
tigation retire or move to a position in 
another agency, thereby evading OIG 
investigations. Currently, the inspec-
tor general cannot require testimony 
of these former employees. Questioning 
these individuals could shed light on 
wrongdoing or mismanagement that 
puts the care and safety of our vet-
erans and their families at risk. 
This bill has bipartisan support in 
Congress as well as from Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan 
Veterans of America, and the Project 
on Government Oversight. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support the legislation. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of S. 2687, which would provide the 
VA inspector general with limited sub-
poena power. In some investigations, 
VA employees who may have impor-
tant information have left the Depart-
ment. At that point, the inspector gen-
eral has no authority to compel their

testimony, which can leave investiga-
tions weak or incomplete. This bill 
would give the inspector general the 
authority to subpoena those former 
employees. 
However, this authority is not with-
out checks and balances. The bill 
would require the IG to notify the At-
torney General before using the sub-
poena. The Attorney General may ob-
ject and prevent the IG from issuing 
the subpoena if doing so would inter-
fere with an ongoing investigation. 
This authority would sunset in May 
of 2025 and would require Congress to 
then evaluate the need for this author-
ity and if it should be continued. This 
is a good bill to expand oversight of the 
VA, and it has my full support. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join me in pass-
ing S. 2687, and I yield back the balance

OF 
VA 
EDUCATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE 
VIA 
ELECTRONIC 
FUND TRANSFER TO A FOREIGN 
INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDU-
CATION 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7375) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to update the pay-
ment system of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to allow for electronic 
fund transfer of educational assistance, 
administered by the Secretary, to a 
foreign institution of higher education. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7375 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PAYMENT OF VA EDUCATIONAL AS-
SISTANCE VIA ELECTRONIC FUND 
TRANSFER TO A FOREIGN INSTITU-
TION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Vet-

tem of the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
allow for electronic fund transfer of edu-
cational assistance, administered by the Sec-
retary, to a foreign institution of higher edu-
cation that— 
(1) provides an approved course of edu-
cation to an eligible recipient of such assist-
ance; and 
(2) does not have— 
(A) an employer identification number; or 
(B) an account with a domestic bank. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7375. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7375, introduced by Representative 
MIKIE SHERRILL. 
This legislation directs VA to finally 
update its student payment systems to 
allow for educational assistance funds 
to be transmitted electronically to a 
foreign institution of higher education, 
as long as the institution is providing 
an approved course of study. Our com-
mittee has heard from students and 
schools about the impact of VA’s in-
ability to modernize its systems for 
student payments. 
The bill has bipartisan support as 
well from Disabled American Veterans, 
Student Veterans of America, Veterans 
Education Success, and the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Representative 
SHERRILL’s legislation is a response to 
strong advocacy for our student vet-
erans studying abroad who are often 
unsure how their benefits will trans-
late overseas. 
Madam Speaker, I thank her for of-
fering this legislation, I urge support 
and passage, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7375, a bill that would 
streamline the payment of GI Bill ben-
efits. 
Specifically, the bill would require 
that, within 90 days of enactment, VA 
update the electronic fund transfer sys-
tem for education benefits. Without 
this change, an overseas school is re-
quired to maintain a U.S.-based bank 
account so that VA can electronically 
transfer payments for VA beneficiaries 
who attend their institution. This re-
quirement has kept some schools from 
participating in the GI Bill. This leads 
to fewer educational choices for our 
veterans. 
I am pleased that this bill would ad-
dress this issue and expand opportuni-
ties for veterans to use their hard- 
earned education benefits. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 7375, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join me in pass-
ing H.R. 7375, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I move

(H.R. 6376) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to extend eligibility for a 
certain work-study allowance paid by 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to

grams of rehabilitation, education, or 
training on at least a half-time basis, 
and for other purposes, as amended.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to insert 
extraneous material on H.R. 6376, as 
amended. 
b 1615 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I strongly support H.R. 6376, as 
amended, the Student Veteran Mod-
ernization Act, which would make 
much-needed improvements and mod-
ernizations to the VA work-study pro-
gram. 
This legislation will create a pilot 
program to allow part-time student 
veterans to access VA work-study pro-
grams for the next 5 years, ensuring 
they can complete their certification 
or degree without taking on unmanage-
able amounts of student debt and still 
care for themselves and their families. 
I would prefer this be a permanent 
change in the law, but I understand the 
need to review these changes in a pilot 
program. I hope that when this pilot 
program concludes, and we have an 
idea of how many veterans were helped, 
Congress will make this change perma-
nent. 
Currently, student veterans must 
maintain a full class load to be eligible 
for work-study, which is not feasible 
for many veterans who are balancing 
families or other work obligations. 
With this change, part-time student 
veterans will be able to earn a pay-
check while also earning workforce 
skills. 
I thank Representative AXNE for her 
hard work on the introduction of this 
bill. I also thank student veterans and 
the Department of Veteran Affairs for 
their feedback, which improved the bill 
and will bring more student veterans 
into the work-study program. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6376, as amended, the Stu-
dent Veteran Work Study Moderniza-
tion Act. 
This bill will make changes to the 
VA work-study program to allow stu-
dent veterans who are using the GI bill 
part-time to take advantage of the 
work-study benefit. The work-study 
benefit provides veterans with the op-
portunity to be paid for helping other 
veterans on campus or VA facilities. 
This is a win-win for the school and 
the veteran, as the school does not 
have to pay the veteran for their work, 
and the veteran receives a paycheck 
and great work experience. 
I am pleased that my amendment at 
the markup of this bill was accepted 
and that the bill is now fully offset. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6376, as amended, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

all my colleagues to join me and pass

Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7153) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress 
a plan to modernize the information 
technology systems of the Veterans 
Benefits Administration, and for other 
purposes, as amended.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department 
of Veterans Affairs Principles of Benefits Au-
tomation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs should increase 
automation in the processing of claims for 
benefits under the laws administered by the 
Secretary in accordance with the following 
principles: 
(1) The purpose of automation should be to 
increase the speed and accuracy of claims 
processing decisions. 
(2) Automation should be conducted in a 
manner that enhances the productivity of 
employees of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs. 
(3) Automation should be carried out in a 
manner that achieves greater consistency in 
the processing and rating of claims by rely-
ing on patterns of similar evidence in claim 
files. 
(4) To the greatest extent possible, auto-
mation should be carried out by drawing 
from information in the possession of the De-
partment, other Government agencies, and 
claimants for benefits. 
(5) Automation of any claims process or de-
termination should not be end-to-end. 
(6) Employees of the Department should 
continue to make decisions with respect to 
the approval of claims and the granting of 
benefits. 
(7) Automation should not be carried out 
in a manner that reduces or infringes upon— 
(A) the due process rights of claimants for 
benefits under the laws administered by the 
Secretary; or 
(B) the duties of the Secretary to assist 
and notify claimants. 
(8) Automation should be carried out while 
taking all necessary measures to protect the 
privacy of claimants and their personally 
identifiable information. 
(9) Automation of claims processing should 
not eliminate or reduce the Veterans Bene-
fits Administration workforce. 
SEC. 3. PLAN FOR MODERNIZATION OF VET-
ERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION

TECHNOLOGY 
SYS-
TEMS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days

cable, during the period covered by the plan. 
(2) A description of how the Secretary in-
tends to incorporate the principles referred

(4) Cost estimates for the modernization of 
each information system identified under 
paragraph (1) for each fiscal year covered by 
the plan and in total. 
(b) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate 
congressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and 
the Subcommittee on Military Construction, 
Veterans’ Affairs, and Related Agencies of 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5002 
May 16, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. TRONE) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7153, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7153, as amended, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs Principles of Bene-
fits Automation Act, introduced by 
Ranking Member BOST. 
This bill provides clarification on the 
sense of Congress on the automation of 
benefits claims and requires the VA to 
submit to Congress a plan for mod-
ernization of the information tech-
nology systems of the Veterans Bene-
fits Administration. 
As the VA moves toward greater au-
tomation, we must ensure that the VA 
does automation the right way for all 
stakeholders, including both veterans 
and the workforce. It is also important 
for the VA to identify systems in need 
of modernization to support successful 
implementation of bills, such as the 
PACT Act, and important initiatives 
such as the Secretary’s announcement 
of several new presumptions. 
I will reinforce that. On the topic of 
automation, it is not the intent of Con-
gress or the VA to use automation on 
claims to eliminate, reduce, or con-
tract out the duties of the VBA work-
force. We intend to conduct close over-
sight of the use of automation and po-
tential expansion. This bill is part of 
those efforts. 
When implemented in the right way, 
automation has the potential to reduce 
the day-to-day burden of employees by 
diminishing menial tasks and allowing 
the dedicated VA staff to focus on the 
kind of work that truly needs a human 
touch. Such an approach stands to ben-
efit the ultimate consumer of the VA: 
our veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill 
and encourage my colleagues to sup-
port it as well, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 7153, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Principles of 
Benefits Automation Act. 
The VA is embracing automation 
more than ever before. The early re-
sults are promising. When used prop-
erly, automation can improve claims 
processing for veterans. However, I am 
concerned that the VA has already 
started multiple automation projects 
without a clear plan or measurable 
goals. There is no consistent guidance 
from the VA on when, why, or how au-
tomation should be used. 
H.R. 7153 will establish the sense of 
Congress that the VA should increase 
automation in benefits processing, ac-
cording to certain principles. Automa-
tion should increase the speed, accu-
racy, and consistency of claims proc-
essing. Automation should also en-
hance employee productivity. Automa-
tion should always protect veterans’ 
privacy and preserve their rights to 
due process. 
However, automation should not nec-
essarily eliminate or reduce the VBA 
workforce. Employees should always 
make the final decision about approv-
ing claims and granting benefits. Let 
me be clear: The sense of Congress is 
that automation should enhance and 
support VBA employees, not replace 
them. I think these guiding principles 
will improve the claims process for vet-
erans and beneficiaries. 
Finally, my bill will require VA to 
submit a plan to Congress to modernize 
its benefits IT system over the next 5 
years. This plan is crucial. 
The expansion of benefits for toxic- 
exposed veterans will put an incredible 
strain on these IT systems. We need to 
be ready. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 7153, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
TRONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7153, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE OF THE GOOD COMMU-
NITY OF BUFFALO, NEW YORK 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, this past weekend, my com-
munity of Buffalo, New York, was rav-
aged by an act of domestic terror. 
A white supremacist used a weapon 
of mass destruction to brutally murder 
10 Black people who were just going 
about their business at the Tops 
Friendly Market on Jefferson Avenue. 
Three others were wounded. 
The victims were ages 32 through 86. 
They were mothers and grandmothers. 
They were fathers and grandfathers. 
They were young adults. They were 
good people of faith, a retired teacher, 
and a retired police officer. 
This premeditated act was planned to 
be broadcast to the world on social 
media showcasing this massacre as the 
playing out of a vile racist fantasy. 
I rise today with my colleagues to 
honor those who have been lost. To 
honor them and to help heal our bro-
ken community, I urge all of my col-
leagues to think about what we can do 
to fight hate. 
We have the power, through our 
words and our votes, to promote civil-
ity, tolerance, and kindness. And we 
have the choice to do better and to 
work together to fight the evil that ex-
ists around us and throughout the 
world. 
Today, we bow our heads in silence, 
but tomorrow—tomorrow—we raise our 
voices loudly against hate. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the victims of the re-
cent shooting in Buffalo, New York. 
DHS 
ROLES 
AND 
RESPONSIBIL-
ITIES IN CYBER SPACE ACT 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8 
of rule XX, the unfinished business is 
the vote on the motion to suspend the 
rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5658) to re-
quire the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity to submit a report on the cyberse-
curity roles and responsibilities of the 
Federal Government, and for other pur-
poses, as amended, on which the yeas 
and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, as amended. 
This is a 5-minute vote. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 313, nays

AMERICAN ENERGY EXCELLENCE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
tonight in strong support of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce’s inquiry 
into China’s predatory trade practices, 
their hacking of U.S. firms, and wide-
spread dumping of foreign solar compo-
nents into the United States. 
While 
China 
routinely 
violates 
human rights and churns out inferior 
products, 
American 
companies 
are 
breaking new ground in the solar sec-
tor and supporting thousands of good- 
paying jobs for middle-class workers 
and families. 
Northwest Ohio is home to two re-
markable such firms: First Solar and 
Toledo Solar. These domestic indus-
tries are charting a course for a new 
era of American energy independence. 
Our energy independence, security, 
and national strength demand we make 
and build solar components right here 
at home. Our Nation must stop relying 
on other countries for far too much of 
what we use. 
We have the workforce and skill sets 
to get the job done right here. Let us 
unleash American energy ingenuity for 
our workers, our communities, and for 
a secure energy future for our Nation 
in perpetuity. 
REMEMBERING HANK LEHWALD 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of a Benedictine High School and 
Savannah baseball star, Hank Lehwald. 
The Benedictine Cadets in Savannah 
have a rich history of success. On top 
of multiple State titles in multiple 
sports, they won a football State title 
this past season. 
That legacy of victory began with a 
baseball team that won the school’s 
first State title, led by Hank. At catch-
er, Hank was a standout. His team-
mates referred to him as ‘‘the general’’ 
due to his tremendous leadership. Hank 
was a 4-year letterman in baseball, 
football, and basketball, and he earned 
many scholarship offers to play foot-
ball from schools like the University of 
Florida. Hank chose to pursue baseball 
and was drafted by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers right out of high school. 
After his baseball days were behind 
him, Hank attended Georgia Military 
College and Georgia Southern Univer-
sity. He was drafted into the United 
States Army and went to Officer Can-
didate School. 
When Hank left the military, he 
founded a successful investment bank-
ing firm in Boca Raton, Florida. In 
2016, Hank was honored by his induc-
tion into the Greater Savannah Area 
Hall of Fame. He is remembered as 
being as good of a person as he was an 
athlete, and he will be dearly missed. 
f 
OUTRAGE OVER SHOOTING IN 
BUFFALO 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in out-
rage over the Buffalo massacre. The 
deaths of the 10 African Americans who 
were 
just 
shopping 
cannot 
go 
unavenged. 
We must punish the vile predator to 
the fullest extent of the law. This 
white supremacist committed an act of 
domestic terrorism and specifically 
targeted a Black community because 
of the rhetoric, such as the false white 
replacement theory pushed by the pre-
vious administration. 
He was also empowered by social 
media websites, such as Twitch and 
Discord, which did not correctly filter 
his hate comments. We must quash the 
growing levels of hate and make sure 
that such an act never happens again. 
We need a national background check 
law to prevent radicalized individuals 
from getting their hands on military- 
style assault weapons. 
A single tragedy of this magnitude is 
a travesty, but allowing all of these 
shootings to become normalized is a 
crime against the American people.

UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise as average gas prices across the 
country approach $4.50. The average 
American household will now have to 
spend an extra $2,000 per year thanks to 
President Biden’s war on American en-
ergy. 
On his very first day in office, he can-
celed the Keystone pipeline. He has 
since raided the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, leaving us unprepared for na-
tional security emergencies. He has 
made it more difficult and expensive to 
drill for oil. And just last week, Presi-
dent Biden canceled drilling permits in 
Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. It is ap-
parent that he wants gas prices to con-
tinue to rise. I don’t know how else to 
say it. 
The folks of middle Tennessee know 
exactly who to blame for rising energy 
costs: President Joe Biden. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden 
must do better. The President’s energy 
policies 
are 
crushing 
middle 
Ten-
nesseans while the answer to this crisis 
lies right under our feet. We can’t af-
ford to wait for the next President to 
unleash America’s energy independ-
ence. 
f 
CONGRATULATING LISA WILKINS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to congratulate my friend Lisa 
Wilkins—I used to know her when she 
was Lisa Morgan—on her retirement 
after 32 years of teaching in the Knox 
County school system. 
Lisa started teaching in 1987 as a 
first-grade teacher at Karns Elemen-
tary School, and she held that position 
for 17 long years. After that, she took 
a job at Rocky Hill Elementary School 
as a teacher for third and fourth grad-
ers, then became a literacy coach for 
Chilhowee Intermediate School, May-
nard Elementary School, and Sequoyah 
Elementary School. She then returned 
to teaching first graders for the last 8 
years of her career at Rocky Hill Ele-
mentary School. 
Lisa’s favorite thing about teaching 
these little kids was the joy she could 
see on their faces, Madam Speaker, 
every day. She loved seeing their sweet 
little faces light up every time they en-
tered her classroom, and she took great 
joy in seeing the proud looks on their 
faces when they finally understood a 
difficult concept. 
Lisa had a positive impact on so 
many students and teachers, Madam 
Speaker, throughout her career. She 
had a special talent for mentoring new 
teachers and helping them find their 
footing, and that talent will surely be 
missed. 
At a weak moment, she married her 
husband, Kent, and 31 wonderful years 
later, they have raised two daughters, 
Morgan and Madison, along with their 
two dogs, Baylee and Brentley. Kent 
adores his wife, as he should, and says 
she is the best mother, wife, and teach-
er anyone could ever dream of. 
I congratulate Lisa on her retire-
ment. I wish her all the best in the 
next chapter of her life. I can’t imagine 
her retiring, since she is 1 year younger 
than I am.

THE INFLATION CRISIS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we just got back from our home dis-
tricts, and we all heard different 
things, but I am sure I talked to doz-
ens, maybe over 100, people over the 
weekend. The number one topic of con-
cern is inflation. 
In particular, I ran across someone 
whose house sold for probably 50 per-
cent more than I would have thought 
that house would sell for a year-and-a- 
half ago. I am sure it was good for the 
person who sold the house, but I feel so 
sorry for young people today. 
Now, why is the cost of housing up so 
much? The same reason the cost of gas 
is up and the same reason the cost of 
food is up. It is because we have a 
greatly increased money supply. 
I encourage all Americans to get on 
your computers, look at M2 and M1, 
measure of the monetary supply. That 
is not something that has anything 
whatsoever to do with the war in 
Ukraine. It is simply overspending on 
the part of this Congress. 
The American Rescue Plan Act, the 
first big spending act of the new ad-
ministration, is one of the most fis-
cally irresponsible things I have ever 
seen. 
But I encourage all Americans, when 
you talk to your Congressman, tell 
them: ‘‘Government is big enough. 
Please don’t spend any more.’’

NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL 
REGULATIONS 
PURSUANT 
TO 
THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT 
MAY 16, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: On May 10, 2022, the 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1096, thereby approving the regula-
tions adopted by the Board of Directors of 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
that 
were 
promulgated 
under 
section 
220(e)(1) of the Congressional Accountability 
Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. § 1351(e)(1), to the extent 
such regulations are consistent with the pro-
visions of the CAA. The approved regulations 
govern unionizing and collective bargaining 
rights in the House offices listed in section 
220(e)(2) of the CAA. 
Section 304 of the CAA, (2 U.S.C. § 1384) pro-
vides that, after congressional approval of 
substantive regulations, the Board shall sub-
mit the regulations to the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and the President 
pro tempore of the Senate. Accordingly, on 
behalf of the Board of Directors of the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights, I am 
transmitting the enclosed Notice of Issuance 
of Final Regulations, together with a copy of 
the final regulations. 
The CAA further specifies that the en-
closed notice be published in the Congres-
sional Record on the first day on which both 
the House and the Senate are in session fol-
lowing this transmittal. Because the ap-
proved regulations only govern rights in the 
House offices listed in section 220(e)(2) of the 
CAA, the Board requests publication only in 
the Congressional Record for the House. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair of the Board of Directors, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (CAA) was enacted into law on January 
23, 1995. In general, the CAA applies the 
rights and protections of 14 federal labor and 
employment law statutes to covered congres-
sional employees and employing offices. Sec-
tion 220 of the CAA addresses the application 
of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code 
(chapter 71), relating to Federal Service 
Labor-Management Relations. Section 220(a) 
of the CAA applies the rights, protections, 
and responsibilities established under sec-
tions 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, 7119 
through 7122, and 7131 of chapter 71 to em-
ploying offices, covered employees, and rep-
resentatives of covered employees. 
Section 220(d) of the Act requires the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (Board) to issue 
regulations to implement section 220. The 
Board adopted final regulations under sec-
tion 220(d) on July 9, 1996; Congress subse-
quently approved those regulations; and they 
became effective on November 30, 1996. 
Section 220(e)(1) of the CAA further re-
quires that the Board issue regulations ‘‘on 
the manner and extent to which the require-
ments and exemptions of chapter 71 . . . 
should apply to covered employees who are 
employed in the offices listed in’’ section 
220(e)(2). The offices listed in section 220(e)(2) 
include: 
(A) the personal office of any Member of 
the House of Representatives; 
(B) a standing, select, special, permanent, 
temporary, or other committee of the House 
of Representatives; 
(C) the Office of the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, the Office of the Major-

On August 19, 1996, the Board, pursuant to 
section 220(e)(1), adopted and submitted for 
publication in the Congressional Record Reg-
ulations Relating to the House of Represent-
atives and Its Employing Offices, which are 
attached to this Notice. On May 10, 2022, the 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1096, thereby approving these regula-
tions to the extent such regulations are con-
sistent with the provisions of the CAA. 
Section 220(f)(2) of the CAA provides that, 
‘‘[w]ith respect to the offices listed in sub-
section (e)(2), to the covered employees of 
such offices, and to representatives of such 
employees, [section 220] shall be effective on 
the effective date of regulations under sub-
section (e).’’ Pursuant to section 304 of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384, approved regulations be-
come effective not less than 60 days after the 
date on which they are published in the Con-
gressional Record. Although the Board has 
the authority to provide for an earlier effec-
tive date for good cause found, the Board 
does not find good cause to provide for an 
earlier effective date for these regulations. 
Therefore, these regulations will become ef-
fective 60 days after the date on which they 
are published in the Congressional Record. 
Accordingly, having now been approved by 
the House, the Board submits its regulations 
to the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives for publication in the Congressional 
Record.

Let us pray. 
Gracious God, You have made of one 
blood all the nations of the Earth. As 
hate crimes rise nationwide, deliver us 
from permitting evil to triumph be-
cause we do nothing. Lord, make us a 
people who refuse to remain idle during 
a crisis. Inspire us to avoid the paral-
ysis of analysis. Remind us that injus-
tice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-
erywhere and that we are diminished 
by every death. 
Keep our lawmakers vigilant, pro-
viding our Nation with profiles of cour-
age through their striving. Lord, use 
our Senators to cause justice to shine 
upon those who sit in the shadows of 
despair. 
And, Lord, thank You for the safe re-

We pray in Your mighty Name.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, SHOOTING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 2 
days ago, barbarism descended upon 
the city of Buffalo. At about 2:30 p.m. 
on Saturday, in a predominantly Black 
neighborhood on Buffalo’s east side, a 
lone gunman, driving from 200 miles 
away, equipped with an assault rifle, 
body armor, and a video camera in his 
helmet, carried out a targeted attack 
against unarmed civilians inside a Tops 
Friendly supermarket. His goal? To 
kill as many Black Americans as pos-
sible. In a matter of minutes, 10 people 
were killed, including a former Buffalo 
Police officer who worked as a security 
guard. At least three more were wound-
ed. It was the deadliest shooting in the 
history of Buffalo and the worst mass 
shooting in America this year. 
Today, we hold in our hearts every 
single New Yorker whose life was trag-
ically cut short during Saturday’s vio-
lence. We weep, knowing nothing— 
nothing—will ever be able to bring 
them back. We mourn with their fami-
lies and with their friends, and with 
the 
entire 
community 
still 
shell-
shocked by this shooting. 
Tomorrow, I will join with President 
Biden, the First Lady, and others to 
travel to Buffalo in order to pay my re-
spects to those who died, as well as to 
visit with the families and to visit with 
the local officials still investigating 
the attack. We also, of course, thank 
our brave first responders who were at 
the scene moments after the shooting. 
Without 
them, 
more 
undoubtedly 
would have been killed. 
We stand—we stand strongly and 
proudly with the community of Buf-
falo, known as the ‘‘city of neighbors.’’ 
Buffalonians during times of crisis 
have always pulled together, and that 
is happening today. 
The East Side community, where the 
shooting occurred, is strong in faith. 
And I know it, along with the entire 
city and region, will overcome this 
tragedy. I say that because I know this 
community. Years ago, I worked hard 
to bring that grocery store to the east 
side of Buffalo because the community 
deserved a full-fledged supermarket. It 
was a much-needed oasis in what was 
then a total food desert. 
I know many in the community shop 
at that grocery store, whether to buy 
food on their way home from church or 
before the Bills games. It is where peo-
ple see friends and relatives and catch 
up on things in between errands. It has 
become a community center. Buffalo is 
the ‘‘City of Good Neighbors,’’ and no-
where is that truer than on the East 
Side. 
Now, I don’t know what could possess 
someone to bring violence to a place

S2508 
May 16, 2022 
like that. What I do know is that this 
weekend’s shooting is part of an ugly 
pattern—one that dates to the earliest 
days of this Nation. Racism has always 
been—and, unfortunately, still is—a 
poison—the poison of America. The 
original sin of slavery and the decades 
of racial terror, discrimination, sepa-
rate but equal, White supremacy, and 
bigotry that followed, unfortunately, 
continue to exert poisonous influence 
on our society—an influence so poi-
sonous that even today, after America 
elected a Black President, after Amer-
ica marched for racial justice, after the 
Senate confirmed a Black Supreme 
Court Justice—a Black woman Su-
preme Court Justice for the first time 
ever—we must still reckon with un-
speakable acts of racial violence like 
what happened Saturday on Jefferson 
Avenue. 
As I said, the community is strong in 
faith, and I know they will overcome 
this tragedy. I know that because I 
know Buffalo. 
Madam President, over the next few 
days, I will continue my conversations 
with local officials and Federal inves-
tigators to get to the bottom of this 
harrowing massacre. But while there is 
much that we don’t know yet about 
Saturday’s shooting, there are a few 
things that are already clear and which 
demand action. 
First, the victims on Saturday were 
not targeted at random, nor was this 
particular grocery store in this par-
ticular neighborhood of Buffalo a hap-
hazard selection. It was not. No, this 
was a racially motivated attack. The 
shooter made his choice by seeking the 
most predominantly Black neighbor-
hood in the region. Online, the shooter 
proudly 
professed 
himself 
as 
a 
neofascist, White supremacist, anti- 
Semite. His views, shared extensively 
online, embraced a dangerous ideology 
known as ‘‘the Great Replacement,’’ 
which asserts that a conspiracy exists 
to replace White Americans with immi-
grants and people of color. 
Racially motivated shootings are, 
sadly, not new in our country. The last 
decade alone holds too many examples 
of too many lives that have been extin-
guished at the hands of shooters har-
boring White racist, White supremacist 
views. It is the same hatred that moti-
vated the shooting at a Walmart in El 
Paso; the same poison that possessed 
the shooter at a synagogue in Pitts-
burgh; the same bigotry that murdered 
eight people in Atlanta last year; and 
the same evil that took the lives of 
nine 
worshippers 
at 
a 
church 
in 
Charleston. It was the same evil at 
play this Saturday in the beloved City 
of Buffalo, NY. 
Not long ago, views like replacement 
theory were only found in the darkest 
places in deranged minds. Then they 
came to be found in hardly viewed 
trenches of the internet and in chat 
rooms that most Americans never 
visit. To most Americans, these ideas 
are transparently repugnant and an af-
front to our core values. They directly 
contravene the message of welcome 
and opportunity symbolized by the 
Statue of Liberty. But, unfortunately, 
with each passing year, it seems harder 
and harder to ignore that the echoes of 
replacement theory and other racially 
motivated views are increasingly com-
ing out into the open and given pur-
ported legitimacy by some MAGA Re-
publicans and cable news pundits. 
The message is not always explicit, 
but we have all seen the pattern. Every 
time MAGA Republicans or pundits 
wrongly vilify immigrants and call 
them invaders, every time they falsely 
claim that millions of undocumented 
people cast ballots in our elections, 
every time loud, bigoted voices bemoan 
the 
disintegration 
of 
an 
imagined 
‘‘classic’’ America, the subtext is clear. 
These hard-right MAGA Republicans 
argue that people of color in minority 
communities are somehow posing a 
threat—a threat—to the American way 
of life. This is replacement theory in a 
nutshell. It is dangerous and a deeply 
anti-American world view. It is poi-
soning 
minds—people’s 
minds—who 
spend hours wandering the darkest 
wastelands of the internet. 
And let’s be clear. It is a message 
that has also found a special home in 
several right-wing outlets and on one 
cable news channel in particular—FOX 
News. In a craven quest for viewers and 
ratings, organizations like FOX News 
have spent years perfecting the craft of 
stoking cultural grievance and polit-
ical resentment that eerily mirrors 
these messages found in replacement 
theory. 
According to one measure by the New 
York Times, FOX’s top political pun-
dit—most 
widely 
watched—Tucker 
Carlson 
has 
spewed 
rhetoric 
that 
echoes replacement theory at least 400 
times on his show since 2016. 
Let me repeat that. According to one 
measure by the New York Times, 
FOX’s top political pundit, Tucker 
Carlson, 
has 
spewed 
rhetoric 
that 
echoes replacement theory at least 
400—400—times on his show since 2016. 
Four hundred times. This is a poison 
that is being spread by one of the larg-
est news organizations in our country. 
Now, to its credit, this morning the 
Wall Street Journal Editorial Board— 
which is run by the same elites who 
run FOX News, owned by the same peo-
ple—the Wall Street Journal Editorial 
Board wrote: 
Politicians and media figures have an obli-
gation to condemn such conspiratorial no-
tions as ‘‘white replacement theory.’’ 
Those are the words of the Wall 
Street Journal editorial page. They are 
right. Condemning racist ideologies 
and violence is necessary, but it is 
hardly sufficient. It is not enough for 
outlets like FOX News to simply con-
demn Saturday’s violence and condemn 
the shooter’s racist views and then re-
turn to their regularly scheduled pro-
gram. To have an impact in the fight 
against domestic violence and extre-
mism, FOX News and their hosts need 
to actually stop spreading dangerous 
ideas like replacement theory on their 
shows. 
Let me say that again. If organiza-
tions like FOX News truly want to con-
demn this weekend’s violence, they 
need to stop spreading ideas like re-
placement theory on their shows. We 
see, sadly, unfortunately, and on sev-
eral all too many occasions what hap-
pens when these views are given a plat-
form. 
Every single media pundit, every sin-
gle elected politician, and, indeed, 
every single voice of influence in this 
country should band together to stomp 
views like replacement theory out of 
existence. These views should have no 
place in American society and cer-
tainly no place in the segments of our 
most-watched news channels. What we 
need to do instead is to respond to 
tragedies like this one, like the one 
that occurred this weekend, with the 
resolve to root out hatred in our coun-
try; and we must leave no stone 
unturned in pursuing solutions that 
make these attacks less likely—these 
tragic, awful, horrible attacks. Just 
look at the pictures of the people who 
died. 
To be clear, denouncing and rooting 
out racist conspiracy theories spread 
by the hard-right is only one step we 
must take and certainly not a sub-
stitute for passing other meaningful 
legislation to address the gun violence 
epidemic. 
But as we mourn those lives that 
were taken away this weekend, as we 
grieve with the survivors, we must also 
make a commitment as Americans to 
oppose the old poisons of racism and 
White supremacy that have been with 
us far too long that inspire these vio-
lent attacks to begin with. 
If we don’t do that—if we don’t do 
that—I fear these attacks will continue 
and even multiply, and true justice in 
a Nation that aspires to E Pluribus 
Unum will continue to evade our great 
Nation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
one more matter that I would like to 
address briefly—and I appreciate the 
indulgence of my friend, the Senator 
from Illinois, who has waited. 
On one other subject, I want to begin 
this week by wishing our colleague and 
dear friend Senator VAN
HOLLEN
a 
smooth and speedy recovery after his 
announcement yesterday that he suf-
fered a mild stroke. Every single one of 
us is relieved—relieved—to hear he is 
doing well; that his incident was 
minor; and that there are no long-term 
effects. We wish our friend recovery 
and look forward to seeing him here in 
the Senate later this week. 
H.R. 7691 
Madam President, on the floor today, 
the Senate is going to hold an impor-
tant vote to move forward desperately 
needed aid for the people of Ukraine as 
they continue fighting against Russian 
aggression. We have a moral obliga-
tion—a moral obligation—to pass this 
assistance as soon as we can in the 
Senate. 
The vast majority of us in this Cham-
ber is united in getting this aid done as 
quickly as possible, including myself 
and the Republican leader, but last 
Thursday, the junior Senator from 
Kentucky prevented the Senate from 
getting Ukraine funding out the door 
and onto the President’s desk. 
The arguments he made on the floor 
last week made clear that he outright 
opposes giving aid to the people of 
Ukraine 
as 
they 
fight 
Russian 
authoritarianism. Senator PAUL’s ob-
struction of Ukraine funding is totally 
unacceptable 
and 
only 
serves 
to 
strengthen Putin’s hand in the long 
run. I urge him to drop his opposition 
so we can reach an agreement to get 
this package passed through the Sen-
ate as soon as we can. 
But, to be clear, his obstruction will 
not—will 
not—prevent 
Ukraine 
aid 
from ultimately passing the Senate. 
One way or another, we are going to 
get this done and send a clear message 
to Ukraine and to the world that 
America stands on the side of democ-
racy and against Putin’s deeply im-
moral campaign of violence. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me join the majority leader in best 
wishes to our colleague CHRIS VAN HOL-
LEN. 
It came as a surprise this morning, 
but we are heartened by the news that 
he is recovering, and we hope he will be 
back with us very, very soon. He is a 
wonderful Senator, who is representing 
his State effectively, and he is very 
close to Members on both sides of the 
aisle. So we wish him and his family all 
the strength and recovery as quickly as 
he can. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, this was another 
weekend of bloodshed and loss in Amer-
ica. 
In Chicago, five people were shot 
dead, including a 16-year-old boy— 
killed near ‘‘The Bean,’’ which those of 
us in Chicago know automatically as 
that sight in Millennium Park where 
people race to gather and take photo-
graphs. It is one of the most popular 
attractions in our city, and just this 
last weekend, it was the scene of a 
murder, with one teenager killing an-
other. 
In California yesterday, a gunman 
walked into a church and opened fire, 
killing 
one 
person 
and 
critically 
wounding four others. That same after-
noon, another gunman opened fire at a 
flea market in Houston, killing two 
and injuring three. 
A weekend in America. 
But both of these mass shootings 
happened less than 24 hours after a 
White supremacist massacred innocent 
shoppers at a grocery store in Buffalo, 
NY. The shooter was wearing tactical 
gear and carrying an AR–15 assault 
rifle—a weapon designed to kill people. 
He shot 13 people, 11 of whom were 
Black, in an act of racist violence; 10 of 
the victims died. Each of these 10 peo-
ple had left home Saturday, maybe to 
grab dinner or to buy groceries for the 
week, and they never returned. Now 
their families are facing the unimagi-
nable trauma of loss. In an instant, 
they lost a grandparent, a child, a 
spouse. 
To those families, I say: You do not 
grieve alone. America grieves with you. 
One of the victims was Aaron Salter. 
He was a retired police officer who was 
working as a security guard at the gro-
cery store when it was attacked. Offi-
cer Aaron Salter was a hero. When the 
gunman entered the store, Officer Salt-
er didn’t flinch; he leapt into action to 
save the lives of the shoppers and em-
ployees, but there was only so much he 
could do. He was armed with a handgun 
while the person who attacked the 
store was wearing a tactical vest and 
firing an assault rifle. Like so many of 
our police who risk their lives for us 
every 
day, 
Officer 
Salter 
was 
outgunned. 
As we mourn Officer Salter’s loss this 
week, our Nation’s Capital is wel-
coming law enforcement from across 
the country for Police Week. 
To every officer who protects our 
communities like Officer Salter did so 
valiantly, we give our thanks. 
No officers should ever find them-
selves in a situation where they are 
outgunned by an assailant, but that is 
exactly what happened in Buffalo this 
weekend, and it happens far too often 
in cities like Chicago. 
For decades, this Senate has failed to 
pass legislation that would close the 
gaping holes in our gun laws and re-
duce the shootings that tear apart law 
enforcement families and families of 
all kinds across the country. How 
many more lives will be lost before we 
act?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2510 
May 16, 2022 
When will the Members of the Senate 
finally join together in recognizing the 
role that White supremacy and White 
nationalism have played in fueling 
these violent terrorist attacks? 
Time and again, I have made my po-
sition on violent extremism as clear as 
I can: The use of violence to advance 
political goals is always—always—un-
acceptable. No matter the ideology, 
right or left, it is wrong, but we need to 
be clear-eyed about the nature of the 
threat that we face. Senior law en-
forcement and intelligence officials 
have warned us on numerous occasions 
that the biggest terrorism threat in 
America today is homegrown. It stems 
from White supremacists and violent 
militia extremists. 
I have been sounding this alarm for 
years. In 2012—2012—10 years ago—I 
first held a hearing on domestic ter-
rorism after a White supremacist mur-
dered seven Sikh worshippers in Oak 
Creek, WI. Today, a decade later, the 
threat is even worse. 
FBI Director Wray testified at the 
Judiciary Committee that the threat of 
domestic terrorism is ‘‘metastasizing 
across the country’’; and last year, the 
FBI reported that our Nation experi-
enced the highest level of hate crimes 
in over a decade. These attacks have 
targeted Black Americans, who have 
long been the target of the majority of 
race-based hate crimes in America, but 
they are not limited to just our Black 
American neighbors. They have also 
targeted Muslim Americans, Japanese 
Americans, members of the AAPI com-
munity, 
and 
members 
of 
other 
marginalized communities as well. 
They don’t happen in a vacuum, and 
it is clear that influential figures on 
the right have been fanning the flames 
of hate. The gunman who attacked the 
grocery store in Buffalo was an adher-
ent of the great replacement theory—a 
conspiracy theory that fuels White su-
premacy and White nationalism. It is 
the same White supremacist conspiracy 
theory that inspired those neo-Nazis to 
march through Charlottesville, VA, 
chanting: ‘‘Jews will not replace us.’’ 
You will remember that group. Presi-
dent Trump said at the time that he 
wasn’t sure that they were out of line. 
They have inspired multiple mass 
shootings, including the attack of Jew-
ish Americans at a Pittsburgh syna-
gogue in 2018, on Hispanic Americans 
at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, and on 
Muslims at two New Zealand mosques 
in 2019 as well. 
This once-fringe conspiracy theory— 
this so-called great replacement the-
ory—has been dragged into the main-
stream by media personalities like 
FOX TV’s Tucker Carlson. According 
to The New York Times, more than 400 
episodes—400 
episodes—of 
Tucker 
Carlson’s news program on FOX TV, 
which attracts more viewers than any 
other show in the history of cable 
news, have alluded to the great re-
placement theory. Tucker Carlson is a 
leading ideologue in the White su-
premacist movement. He has even in-
troduced 
racist 
terminology 
into 
America’s 
conversation, 
like 
the 
phrase ‘‘legacy Americans,’’ which re-
fers to the idea that immigrants aren’t 
real Americans. The phrase was first 
used on White supremacist forums and 
websites. Tucker Carlson is right at 
home with it. 
But here is what is the most shock-
ing to me: the number of elected offi-
cials who will jump at any chance to 
get featured on Carlson’s show and 
echo his White supremacist blather— 
his dark gospel of fear and hate and 
racism. We don’t have to look far to 
find those elected officials. The third- 
ranking House Republican claimed in a 
campaign ad that Democratic immi-
gration policies ‘‘will overthrow our 
current electorate.’’ 
What will it finally take for the Re-
publican Party to condemn this hate 
once and for all, and what will it take 
for Members of the Senate to join to-
gether in rooting out White suprema-
cist violence? 
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I will soon hold a hearing 
on 
domestic 
terrorism, 
and 
the 
ideologies like the great replacement 
conspiracy theory that inspired the 
acts of hate will be expounded on at 
that hearing by experts. 
We will also examine a piece of legis-
lation that I introduced 5 years ago, 
the Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act, which would strengthen Federal 
efforts to prevent and address White 
supremacist violence and other forms 
of domestic terrorism. This legislation 
is an opportunity for the Members of 
the Senate to stand united against 
hate. By passing it, along with com-
monsense gun safety measures, we can 
finally address the scourge of hate and 
violence that has claimed far too many 
American lives. 
Many Americans will be tuned in this 
week to Tucker Carlson’s show to see if 
he has any reaction to what happened 
in Buffalo. Could it be that, for one 
shining moment, he will finally realize 
his complicity in what happened after 
400 shows of spewing fear and hate and 
in subscribing to this great replace-
ment theory, resulting in hatred across 
this country which is visited on com-
munities every single day? 
Ten people died in Buffalo. Will 
Tucker Carlson take 10 minutes to say 
he is sorry for any role he might have 
played in that outcome? 
We will see. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, there was some sobering data 
that came out from the CDC last week. 
It was a new set of preliminary data on 
overdose deaths. Last year, we lost al-
most 108,000 people to the ravages of 
drug abuse. Almost 4,000 of those 
108,000 were Tennesseans. Those 2021 
numbers are the worst that we have 
ever seen, and I am concerned because 
it seems that my Democratic col-
leagues and their friends in the White 
House are not seeing the big picture on 
this issue. 
Now, the White House claims they 
have a plan to address the drug crisis 
in this country, but they have inten-
tionally ignored a key vulnerability 
when they do this. It is as if they are 
turning a blind eye to a key compo-
nent, to a key contributing factor, of 
this drug crisis, and they are refusing 
to talk about it. It is the reason that 
crime is on the rise in most of our 
American communities. It is also the 
reason it is easier for drug dealers to 
get their hands on fentanyl than on 
just about anything else, and it is the 
same reason that human traffickers 
now are pushing people—the sex traf-
ficking gangs, the labor gangs—into 
communities all across this country. 
Indeed, every town is a border town 
and every State a border State because 
of this key vulnerability. 
They don’t want to talk about this 
because I don’t think they want to 
admit that they have been so wrong. Of 
course, that vulnerability, whether you 
are talking about drugs, whether you 
are talking about crime in the streets, 
all comes down to talking about that 
wide-open southern border. Don’t take 
my word for it. Go talk to sheriffs in 
Tennessee. They will tell you that, 
with the open border, they are seeing 
the results of that on their streets and 
in their counties. 
Indeed, one of the sheriffs I visited 
with last week said 80 percent of the 
drug overdoses, 80 percent of the appre-
hended 
drugs 
in 
their 
county— 
fentanyl. Why is it there? The southern 
border being wide open. 
This is an area in which Tennesseans 
are wanting to see something done, and 
they can’t figure out why the Demo-
crats won’t make a priority of securing 
the southern border when they want to 
talk issues that stem from what is 
transpiring at the southern border. 
They feel that the Democrats are delib-
erately sabotaging our economic recov-
ery, our recovery from the pandemic, 
and they are making bad situations 
worse because they won’t talk about 
the root causes. 
The Biden administration never was 
interested in securing the border. In-
deed, he hasn’t been to the border. In 
fact, their official policy from day one 
has been: Let’s make that southern 
border more insecure. Isn’t that amaz-
ing? You have an administration and 
you have a DHS Secretary who don’t 
believe in a secure border. 
The radical left didn’t like the optics 
of 
border 
security, 
so 
Joe 
Biden 
stopped building the wall. Even though 
everything is purchased and it is 
there—the wall can be completed—he 
chose not to secure our border, and he 
stopped building the wall. 
The radical left wanted to change the 
definition of ‘‘asylum’’ without both-
ering to change the law, so Joe Biden 
threw away the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ 
policy. 
The radical left wanted their sanc-
tuary cities back, so Joe Biden tied the

hands of immigration officials. Go talk 
to them. They will tell you what they 
are no longer able to do, which is abide 
by the rule of law—the laws that are on 
the books. 
With each Executive order that he 
signed, Joe Biden sabotaged Border Pa-
trol and law enforcement, putting 
Americans in danger, and turned even 
more vulnerable women and children 
into victims of the sex trafficking 
trade. 
You have to ask yourself whose side 
the Biden administration is actually on 
when it comes to the issues of crime, 
when it comes to the issue of pro-
tecting women and children, because I 
can’t think of a single law-abiding 
American who is better off for all of 
this. But I do know that the cartels are 
happy because they are the ones who 
control the southern border on that 
Mexico side. You cannot cross that bor-
der into the United States unless you 
have gone through the cartel, so they 
are having to work out a way to pay 
their fee to the cartel, endangering 
their lives, seeing drugs pushed into 
this country. 
Last year, Border Patrol intercepted 
thousands of pounds of deadly drugs 
and 
repeatedly 
interrupted 
equally 
deadly migrant trafficking operations, 
but we will never be able to account for 
the ‘‘got-aways’’ who escaped into the 
country with their drugs and their 
human cargo intact. 
The level of self-sabotage has a pur-
pose. The Biden administration has 
made it clear that they are willing to 
risk lives and livelihoods to prove their 
commitment to what they are calling 
‘‘compassion.’’ 
Let me ask you this, Madam Presi-
dent: What is compassionate about 
women being pushed into the sex trade, 
little girls being sex trafficked, chil-
dren being thrown into gangs? What is 
compassionate about that? That is 
what is happening because of this open 
southern border. This is insanity. 
The cartels last year brought people 
from 160 different countries to our 
southern border. Those are stats from 
the Border Patrol. We know that, right 
now, they are anticipating bringing 
people in at the end of title 42. They 
are already working globally—glob-
ally—in order to hit these numbers. 
This is insanity. 
According to the Biden administra-
tion, we can’t secure the border and 
stop the flow of drugs, but the Federal 
Government can hand out fresh crack 
pipes to those with addiction. And as 
much as they tried to say, no, that was 
incorrect, we have all seen the photos. 
According to the Biden administra-
tion, we can’t allow shipments of per-
fectly safe, foreign-made baby formula 
into American communities. We can’t 
process those waivers, they say. That 
could possibly be dangerous. We can’t 
get a baby formula plant open in 
Michigan because the FDA is busy; 
they have other priorities. Meanwhile, 
parents are scrambling, trying to find 
formula for babies who have to have 
specific formulas. This is not compas-
sion; this is a tragedy. 
I saw a friend this weekend. She calls 
herself 
independent-minded, 
leans 
more moderate Democrat. She said: 
You know, we have always been a gov-
ernment of, by, and for the people, but 
right now, what do we see happening? 
We see this government using people to 
get power for themselves. That is what 
is going on. People realize this admin-
istration is void of priorities. 
The saddest thing about all of this is 
that the Biden administration, I think, 
knows what needs to be done. Many of 
my colleagues and I have been talking 
about it, that there should be priorities 
to secure this Nation and our sov-
ereignty. Priority No. 1 right now 
should be to keep title 42 in place until 
three things happen. 
First, DHS needs to present a thor-
ough and specific plan that would en-
able American officials to handle the 
anticipated 18,000 people per day who 
Border Patrol is saying will come to 
our border if those restrictions are lift-
ed. Right now, it is about 6,000 people 
per day. 
Now, 18,000—I looked it up. Illinois 
has 1,466 cities, and 1,324 of those cities 
have 18,000 or fewer citizens. That is 
their population. So that is the equiva-
lence that we are talking about. Our 
friend from Colorado was just on the 
floor. There are 482 cities there, and 439 
of them have 18,000 or fewer citizens. 
We have Alaska. We have 355 cities in 
Alaska, and 350 of them have 18,000 or 
fewer citizens. It is like a new city in 
Alaska or Colorado or Illinois or Ten-
nessee every single day. So DHS needs 
to come through. 
Second, Chairman DURBIN must sum-
mon Secretary Mayorkas to a hearing 
before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
so that we can subject that plan that 
has been missing to scrutiny. 
Third, they need to consult with Con-
gress to give Border Patrol and law en-
forcement the manpower and resources 
they need to execute the plan. 
Then and only then should we con-
sider title 42. 
Priority No. 2 is to stop playing poli-
tics and embrace President Trump’s 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. We know 
for a fact that it helped control the in-
flux of asylum seekers, which, in turn, 
took the pressure off our limited re-
sources at the border. 
Priority No. 3: The Biden administra-
tion must stop denying reality. Finish 
building the wall, which is what Border 
Patrol has been asking for for decades. 
Give them a physical barrier. Give 
them more officers and agents. Give 
them more technology so they can pro-
tect our Nation and our citizens. That 
is how we would get that border under 
control. 
As I said, it affects crime in the 
streets. It affects drugs and fentanyl. 
This affects our citizens, our families, 
who are heartbroken—heartbroken—by 
loss of lives to drugs, to crime. 
There is a starting point. There is a 
way to make a difference. But if this 
administration wants to do something 
about crime, if they want to do some-
thing about the drug crisis, they need 
to start it at the southern border. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, by the time the average Amer-
ican worker retires, they will have 
worked over 16,000 days. Put another 
way, by the time an individual reaches 
the average retirement age in the 
United States, they will have clocked 
approximately 133,000 hours—the point 
being, Americans work hard to retire 
comfortably. 
To help them reach their retirement 
goals, many employers offer retire-
ment savings and investment plans, 
commonly known as a 401(k). In fact, 91 
million Americans invest in a 401(k). 
Many of these plans have what is called 
a brokerage window, which is a tool 
used by retirement savers to self-select 
some of the things that they buy with-
in their brokerage account. They can 
do it themselves. The brokerage com-
pany does not do it. Simply put, they 
get to choose what their hard-earned 
money is invested in. 
If someone in Lamar County, AL, is 
getting up at the crack of dawn, 
clocking 14 hours at work, and knows 
their retirement goals and personal cir-
cumstances very well, who better to 
decide how to invest the money they 
are making? Who better to decide but 
them? But, as we have seen time and 
time again, common sense and indi-
vidual freedoms are the enemy of the 
Biden administration. The Biden ad-
ministration has their eyes set on 
Americans’ 
financial 
freedom 
yet 
again. This time, the Department of 
Labor is specifically targeting workers’ 
ability to invest their 401(k) savings 
and assets as they see fit. 
Recent regulatory guidance released 
by the Department of Labor’s Em-
ployee Benefits Security Administra-
tion attempts to bar 401(k) accounts 
from investing in cryptocurrency, sin-
gling out this specific investment type. 
The guidance threatens to investigate 
plans that allow participants to select 
investments in cryptocurrency, includ-
ing plans where retirement savers use 
brokerage windows to self-select in-
vestments in cryptocurrency. 
This 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
long-
standing practice. The Department of 
Labor has long permitted employers to 
offer brokerage windows as an option 
to employees who prefer to personally 
invest their own money and manage 
their own money within these windows. 
The Agency’s new guidance ends this 
tradition of economic empowerment in 
favor of Big Brother government con-
trol. 
The Employee Benefits Security Ad-
ministration goes a step further by 
seeking to place a massive new regu-
latory burden on 401(k) plan fiduciaries 
by requiring them to assess the suit-
ability of investments accessed using a

brokerage window. This would under-
mine the ability of retirement savers 
to invest as they see fit. It is their 
money; they should be able to invest it 
how they want to invest it. 
The Biden administration’s Depart-
ment of Labor—their guidance singles 
out this cryptocurrency for some rea-
son, but it is clear retirement savers 
want to have that option to invest 
their own money. 
Fidelity, one of the Nation’s No. 1 fi-
nancial agencies, is the largest 401(k) 
provider in the country and recently 
announced that it will make Bitcoin 
available on its platform. They aren’t 
the first provider to make this move. 
There are others. And they won’t like-
ly be the last. Sadly, the Department 
of Labor has already criticized these 
plans to empower investors. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
not 
just 
about 
cryptocurrency—and it could not be 
just about cryptocurrency. It is bigger 
than that. Today, the Biden adminis-
tration is targeting cryptocurrency. 
Which investment class is next? Is it 
fossil fuels? Is it oil companies? Is it a 
gun company, securities, other invest-
ments that don’t align with the envi-
ronmental, social, and corporate gov-
ernance 
preferences 
of 
President 
Biden? 
This is about Americans’ freedom to 
chart their own financial destiny. 
Americans should be able to invest 
their 
retirement 
savings 
as 
they 
choose. That is why I introduced the 
Financial Freedom Act. My bill would 
prohibit the Department of Labor from 
issuing any regulation or guidance lim-
iting the types of investments that 
self-directed 401(k) account investors— 
they do not limit what they can choose 
through a brokerage window. It would 
also push back on the Biden adminis-
tration’s plan to punish asset managers 
who authorize individual retirement 
savers to self-direct their investment 
choices using a brokerage window. 
The Financial Freedom Act empow-
ers the American retirement saver and 
preserves the precedent of investment 
freedom. For decades, 401(k) partici-
pants in plans with brokerage windows 
have been able to buy and sell invest-
ments of their choice. That freedom to 
choose is the entire purpose of the bro-
kerage window. The Department of 
Labor should not be able to limit the 
range or types of investments savers 
can select. 
The choice of what you invest your 
retirement savings in should be yours, 
not the government’s. The govern-
ment-knows-best 
approach 
being 
pushed by the current administration 
runs counter to the values that made 
our country the most prosperous Na-
tion in history. 
I urge my colleagues to support fi-
nancial choice and freedom, to uphold 
our tradition of economic empower-
ment. I hope my fellow Senators will 
join me in preserving the choice of 
every American worker. They should 
have their own financial decisions, 
where they can make those decisions 
for their future and for their family’s 
future, chart their own destiny, and 
reap the benefits of their hard work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
feel as though the Presiding Officer has 
the misfortune of being the Presiding 
Officer every time I come out here to 
speak. So I apologize for that, but I 
thank you for your patience and for 
your indulgence. 
Madam President, when I was in the 
second grade, we were asked to line up 
in our classroom by the people whose 
family had been here the shortest pe-
riod of time and whose family had been 
here the longest period of time, and I 
turned out to be the answer to both of 
those questions. My father’s family 
went all the way back to basically be-
fore the founding of the United States, 
and my mother had recently arrived, 
having survived the Holocaust in and 
around Warsaw with her parents, John 
and Helena Klejman, who came to this 
country to rebuild their shattered 
lives. So one person going back to the 
beginning; another person recently ar-
rived. 
That is not an unusual story for this 
country. That is a usual story for this 
country. It is an unusual story in the 
world because a lot of other countries 
aren’t like the United States of Amer-
ica in this way. There is literally no 
other country on the planet for which 
immigration is so central to its history 
and identity as the United States of 
America. 
People all over the world want to 
come here because we live in a country 
that respects human freedoms and re-
spects human rights. They want to 
share in the American dream. They 
want to be part of the oldest democ-
racy in human history. We should cele-
brate that on this floor. We should cel-
ebrate that fact on this floor. People 
aren’t lining up to go to Russia. They 
aren’t crossing the Gobi Desert to go to 
China. They want to come here. That 
should give us enormous pride as 
Americans. I feel proud of that. I am 
proud of that. 
My grandparents were filled with joy 
to be Americans. I have never met any-
body—I have traveled my State exten-
sively and the United States exten-
sively. I have never met a person who 
has a stronger accent than my grand-
parents had. And they are the greatest 
patriots I ever knew—not because they 
thought this country was perfect but 
because they believed we had a way of 
correcting our imperfections and that 
they could be part of that even though 
they came from someplace else and 
spoke a different language. 
Over our history, immigration has 
been a uniquely American strength. 
Today, immigrants lead one in four 
startups. They are more than half of 
all STEM workers with Ph.Ds. They 
are nearly 3 in 10 physicians in this 
country and nearly 4 in 10 home 
healthcare aides. And they are more 
than 70 percent—70 percent—of all 
farmworkers, the men and women who 
work tirelessly day after day after day, 
late into the night, to keep us fed and 
were doing that during the pandemic 
without rest. 
While other industrialized nations 
have seen their populations decline and 
their economies stagnate, immigration 
has been vital to the American econ-
omy. If you look at the history of the 
United States for the last 150 years or 
so, what you see is that there are vari-
ations. Sometimes we grow; sometimes 
we don’t. But, roughly, it is 3 percent a 
year of economic growth. Two percent 
of that is organic. One percent of that 
is immigration. If you cut off immigra-
tion, that is a third of our economic 
growth over the years. 
I think most of America understands 
this. I think people in Colorado under-
stand this well. They know that immi-
gration is fundamental to our history 
and to our identity, to our economy, 
but they also have a reasonable expec-
tation that the government is man-
aging immigration in a responsible 
way, in a way that is consistent with 
our best traditions as a nation and up-
holds the rule of law. 
After I was first elected to the Sen-
ate, one of the first things I worked on 
was something we called the Colorado 
Compact. I stole the idea from a Re-
publican. I think he was the attorney 
general of the State of Utah. He cre-
ated the Utah Compact. I went out 
with my friend, a former Senator, a Re-
publican from Colorado named Hank 
Brown, and we developed something 
called the Colorado Compact. I spent 18 
months working on it. We traveled 
6,300 miles around the State of Colo-
rado. We had 230 meetings. We talked 
to farmers and business owners, with 
law enforcement, educators, faith lead-
ers, ski resorts, Latino leaders. All of 
them were struggling with different 
pieces of our broken immigration sys-
tem. 
Not surprisingly when you have con-
versations like that around people’s 
kitchen tables or in the county court-
houses, we found that there was a lot 
more agreement on what immigration 
reform should look like than you would 
ever think possible if all you did was 
listen to the cable television at night 
or read your social media feed—neither 
of which I recommend anybody spend 
their time doing. 
We developed a set of principles in a 
bipartisan way, in rural parts of Colo-
rado as well as urban and suburban 
parts of the State. We had some of the 
most conservative organizations 
in 
Colorado—Club 20 comes to mind—that 
endorsed this and some of the most ag-
gressive immigrant rights groups who 
supported this. And the principles that 
we developed included a commitment 
to the rule of law, our heritage as a na-
tion of immigrants, and a secure bor-
der. That is how you get a broad coali-
tion together on immigration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2513 
May 16, 2022 
One thing we agreed on was that the 
issue needs more than piecemeal re-
forms. No State effort is a substitute 
for a commonsense national strategy 
to overhaul our immigration system. 
That is why, a few years later, I was 
one of four Democrats who served on 
the Gang of 8 here in 2013. We had four 
Republicans and we had four Demo-
crats, and we worked for months on a 
piece 
of 
legislation 
that 
became 
known, I guess, as the Gang of 8 bill. It 
was the first comprehensive immigra-
tion bill in years in this place, and the 
elements of it were aligned exactly 
with what we had said in the Colorado 
Compact: the tough but fair pathway 
to citizenship; the most progressive 
Dream Act that had ever been con-
ceived, much less written or voted on, 
on the floor of the Senate; a massive 
overhaul of our visa system; $46 billion 
of border security—not a medieval wall 
but 
state-of-the-art 
military 
tech-
nology so we could see every inch of 
the border. We doubled the number of 
border agents in that bill. We had 300 
miles—I think even more than that—of 
new fencing as a result of that bill. 
In a moment that today almost 
seems unimaginable—but this is why I 
wanted to come to the floor today, 
really, was to remind people of this; 
the pages who are here won’t even be-
lieve it—this came to the floor, and it 
passed with 68 votes. It almost got 70 
votes in 2013. 
Then it went over to the House of 
Representatives, and tragically—trag-
ically—instead of just putting the bill 
on the floor and letting the House work 
its will, the Freedom Caucus got to ex-
ercise a veto, and they said: If you 
can’t get a majority of the majority, 
we are not going to let you pass this 
bill—even though a majority of the 
House of Representatives wanted to 
pass the bill because there were enough 
people from both parties who could see 
the benefit of this comprehensive im-
migration bill. 
And I realize, you know, now we are 
in a different day. That was then; this 
is now. It was a different negotiation, a 
different deal. And it was a different 
Senate, for that matter. It was a Sen-
ate, thanks to John McCain, that occa-
sionally worked—and others like him. 
I think that we have got to figure out 
a way to get past this logjam and to-
ward a solution where we honor our 
heritage as a nation of immigrants, we 
secure the benefits to our economy of a 
working immigration system, we com-
ply with the rule of law, and we give 
the American people confidence that 
our border is secure. None of that is an 
unreasonable expectation, but we are 
nowhere near meeting that expectation 
today. Instead, politicians have used 
our broken immigration system as one 
more issue to bludgeon the other side, 
to not make progress. That was the 
theory of the people who killed the bill 
in 2013, was that they could get more 
out of the politics of not passing the 
bill than they would by passing the 
bill. 
I actually think—I think they got 
more than they were even bargaining 
for. They couldn’t have imagined when 
they voted against that bill that they 
would end up nominating a Presi-
dential candidate who rode an esca-
lator down in his building talking 
about how Mexicans are rapists and 
that that guy not only was nominated; 
he went on to become President of the 
United States. Staggering. Staggering. 
I think there is some question about 
whether American history would have 
changed in really profound ways if we 
had been able to pass that comprehen-
sive bill, and the cost has been just ter-
rible for the country for our inability 
to do it. 
Our businesses are desperate to hire 
computer scientists and engineers, but 
because our visa system is broken, we 
are literally training Ph.Ds and send-
ing them back to countries like India 
or China or to Canada. We have Dream-
ers who are living in perpetual fear, un-
able to plan for their future in the only 
country they have ever known. This 
Senate has been unable to deal with 
the issue of the Afghan interpreters 
who are people who fought side by side, 
worked side by side with our soldiers in 
Afghanistan because of our broken sys-
tem and the politics around immigra-
tion. 
In Colorado, we have a $47 billion ag-
riculture industry. It is lifeblood of our 
State. I have met vegetable growers in 
Brighton and peach growers in Palisade 
who don’t have enough labor to harvest 
the crops. And the system is broken. 
We fixed that in 2013, too. I nego-
tiated that with Orrin Hatch, God rest 
his soul, and MARCO RUBIO and DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN. That is who negotiated the 
agriculture provisions of the bill. 
In Colorado, it is not just farmers. 
We don’t have enough workers for our 
steer. Across the country, we don’t 
have enough doctors. We don’t have 
enough nurses or childcare providers or 
home health aides. We have 11 million 
unfilled jobs in this country right now 
because the economy has come back, 
but we haven’t been able to fill these 
vacancies. You can draw a straight line 
from our broken immigration system 
to the country’s labor shortages to 
some of the high prices that we see in 
this economy. 
So Americans—once again, no one 
around here bears the burden of not 
getting the job done, but Americans 
are paying the price for an immigra-
tion system that doesn’t work. The last 
time we reformed our immigration sys-
tem in a comprehensive way was 1986. 
For those keeping score, I was a junior 
in college then; I am 57 today. So that 
is an incredibly long period of time, 
and that was when Ronald Reagan was 
President. 
But a lot has changed in 36 years. 
Today, we are in an era of mass migra-
tion propelled by COVID, global insta-
bility, and climate change. And it is 
only going to get worse. Our immigra-
tion system, including our asylum sys-
tem, isn’t built for today’s conditions. 
It is one reason why we have a per-
petual 
humanitarian 
crisis 
at 
our 
southern border. And that crisis should 
not be an excuse to not act. That crisis 
should be a reason for us to act. 
Right now, the administration has 
the resources to process 3,500 migrants 
a day at the border, but they are re-
ceiving 8,000 a day, and we could see up 
to 18,000 a day by this summer. If that 
happens, the money is going to run out 
in July, overwhelming any border in-
frastructure and deepening the human-
itarian crisis that is there. 
None of this should surprise us. 
There is a surge at the border every 
summer; and since we know it is com-
ing, we need a plan. I am sorry to say 
this, but the administration doesn’t 
have one. I read what they put out last 
month. I didn’t see any benchmarks, 
any timelines, any accountability on 
implementation. I did see a lot of what 
I think is wishful thinking about ev-
erything being under control when 
they aren’t under control. That is not 
what the American people believe. 
That is not what public servants and 
organizations at the border report. 
And now the administration wants to 
lift title 42, which is going to make a 
bad situation even worse. We can’t 
keep title 42 forever. It is no substitute 
for a comprehensive plan, but lifting it 
now before we have a plan, I think is a 
mistake and it is going to erode the 
American people’s confidence that we 
have the situation at the border under 
control. And it is going to deepen the 
humanitarian crisis at the border. It is 
going to deepen the humanitarian cri-
sis at the border. 
By the way, part of that plan—if we 
had a plan—should be having a con-
versation—leading 
a 
conversation— 
with leaders across Latin America to 
see how we can come together as a re-
gion to help people that have been dis-
located by violence and by corruption. 
Until we solve this in a comprehen-
sive way, these issues are going to keep 
coming up and they are going to keep 
dividing us here. Today, it is title 42. 
And in the last administration, we lit-
erally shut the government down—lit-
erally shut the government down—over 
a debate about whether Mexico would 
pay for the wall, which, by the way, 
they were never going to do and they 
never did. We created DACA under one 
President only to see it canceled in the 
next Presidency. 
We could have spared America all of 
this. We could have spared America all 
of this if we had passed the Gang of 8 
bill in 2013. We could have spared the 
harm to our communities and our 
economy, but also the harm to our de-
mocracy from the mindless political 
fights over the past decade when people 
in the Senate turned immigration into 
political napalm instead of lifting it up 
as part of our history, a central part of 
who we are. 
If there is any silver lining to our 
failure to pass comprehensive reform 
in 2013, it is that we clearly dem-
onstrated that Democrats cannot fix

this by themselves. We are going to 
need two parties working together to 
do it. The good thing about immigra-
tion is that there are a lot of different 
issues, there are a lot of different con-
stituencies, and there are a lot of ways 
to construct a deal. 
The former chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee is on the floor, Senator 
LEAHY, from Vermont. If I am not mis-
taken, Senator LEAHY would chair the 
Judiciary Committee when we were 
considering the 2013 Gang of 8 bill. 
That was an extraordinary process, an 
open amendment process—I will yield 
for the chairman to speak. 
Mr. LEAHY. If I might say, the Sen-
ator was absolutely right. He was cen-
tral in putting that together. 
Unfortunately, it passed here; would 
have passed the House. They had 
enough votes—enough votes, Repub-
licans and Democrats. But the then- 
Speaker said he couldn’t bring it up be-
cause it didn’t have a majority of his 
party and it would violate the sacred 
Dennis Hastert rule. I don’t think they 
follow that rule after former-Speaker 
Hastert went to jail. 
Mr. BENNET. I thank the chairman 
for his historical recollection, which is 
100 percent correct. I just want to 
make it clear, again, how extraor-
dinary the process was. 
You know, when people—I think peo-
ple in this country are entitled to be-
lieve that the way this place works is 
the way that old ‘‘Schoolhouse Rock’’ 
cartoon said it worked about how a bill 
becomes a law. I think people ought to 
be entitled to believe this is the way 
this place works. It almost never works 
that way, but it did in the case of this 
bill and in the case of the chairman’s 
leadership in the Judiciary. 
We just need people who are willing 
to work together here. I have contin-
ued to work with MIKE CRAPO from 
Idaho, a Republican, working on a deal 
to try to create a pathway to legaliza-
tion for farmworkers. If we can do 
that, I don’t see a reason why we can’t 
raise our sights and come together as a 
Senate to finally fix our broken immi-
gration system. 
There is no one else to address this 
but the 100 Senators that are in this 
Chamber. I am prepared to work with 
any one of them—anybody here—to get 
it done because we don’t have to choose 
between our heritage as a Nation of im-
migrants and our commitment to the 
rule of law. We do not have to choose 
between a medieval wall and the Stat-
ue of Liberty. 
We can end the partisan warfare over 
immigration that has hurt our econ-
omy, our communities, and our stand-
ing in the world. We can give a real 
pathway to citizenship for those will-
ing to invest in the American dream. 
We can secure the border. We can make 
immigration the wind in our sails once 
again and give the American people 
confidence that we have a fair system 
in place to welcome people—like my 
mom and her parents—who want noth-
ing more than to contribute to this Na-
tion and to our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
finish my statement prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 7691 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the hor-
rors we have witnessed in the weeks 
and months following Vladimir Putin’s 
unprovoked attack on Ukraine are an 
abomination and an affront to all civ-
ilized 
people—entire 
communities 
wiped from the face of the earth; 
countless lives ruined; unarmed civil-
ians summarily executed randomly in 
the street; millions of desperate people 
fleeing 
everything 
they 
have 
ever 
known because of one man’s zeal to de-
stroy whatever is necessary to realize 
his own twisted vision of the world—all 
of this while fueling a broader humani-
tarian crisis across the region, spi-
raling costs, and sparking a global hun-
ger crisis. 
The need is clear for this Congress to 
act decisively and to act now to reaf-
firm our unwavering support for the 
Ukrainian people in protecting their 
lives and their country and to stem 
this global crisis. The United States 
stands against the atrocities inflicted 
upon the free people of Ukraine, an 
independent country with a democrat-
ically elected government. 
Last Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 
7691, providing more than $40 billion in 
emergency funding, with overwhelming 
bipartisan support. The Senate should 
have done the same, sending this bill to 
the President so that he could imme-
diately execute on it and get this 
much-needed aid into Ukrainian hands. 
Unfortunately, one Member has de-
cided to slow this process down. One 
Member has caused needless delay. In a 
few moments, we will vote to invoke 
cloture on the motion to proceed to 
H.R. 7691. Because of Senator PAUL’s 
objection, we must go through this 
step just to bring up the bill for debate. 
I urge everyone to vote yes. And I 
would urge the Senator from Kentucky 
to reconsider his objections and help us 
move quickly to get this bill to the 
President. 
This emergency bill provides $40.1 
billion—$7.1 billion more than the ad-
ministration 
requested—in 
critical 
military and humanitarian assistance 
for Ukraine, to help defend democracy 
abroad and to address the rising, global 
hunger crisis that the world is facing 
in large part due to Russia’s aggres-
sion. 
This includes $8.5 billion in addi-
tional Presidential drawdown author-
ity for critical weapons transfers and 
$6 billion for the Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative. This will allow us 
to continue to supply the Ukrainians 
with the tools they need to defend 
themselves, their country, and their 
freedom. The urgent need for these re-
sources cannot be overstated. As we 
stand here today, the administration is 
raising the alarm that if we do not act, 
the resources we provided in March— 
which have been critical to Ukraine’s 
success on the battlefield—will be ex-
hausted in a matter of days. 
It includes more than $8.5 billion for 
the economic support fund to respond 
to emerging needs in the country and 
ensure the continuing operation of the 
government. It provides needed re-
sources for temporary housing, medical 
care, food, and other basic services for 
Ukrainian’s displaced in their own 
country and refugees fleeing the vio-
lence and devastation Vladimir Putin 
has inflicted on them and their com-
munities. 
The humanitarian crisis instigated at 
the hands of Vladimir Putin is not lim-
ited to within Ukraine’s borders or 
even within the borders of Eastern Eu-
rope. It has triggered a global hunger 
crisis. Last year, before Putin’s war, 
Ukraine grew enough food to feed 400 
million people. Today, Ukraine cannot 
even feed its own people. As David 
Beasley, the Executive Director of the 
UN World Food Programme—WFP— 
testified 
before 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee last week, war has forced 
Ukraine from being a global bread bas-
ket to being on the bread lines. 
Tens of millions of tons of wheat, 
barley, maize, vegetable oil, and other 
Ukrainian 
produce 
are 
currently 
locked in warehouses and languishing 
in ports occupied by Russian forces. If 
the ports are not opened, this food will 
either be stolen or go to waste, leading 
to skyrocketing prices and regional 
shortages. The WFP estimates that 
this will have a ripple effect, increas-
ing the number facing acute hunger by 
47 million. This would bring the esti-
mated global total to 323 million peo-
ple suffering from acute hunger in the 
81 countries WFP operates in alone. 
It is important to remember that 
hunger is not a moment in time; it has 
lasting consequences for families, com-
munities, and whole societies. This is 
why we cannot wait to act on this cri-
sis. As noted in one recent Washington 
Post editorial; preventing a looming, 
global famine is ‘‘as urgent and mor-
ally necessary as sending tanks to 
Ukraine.’’ 
This bill provides over $5 billion for 
global food aid. If those funds are pro-
grammed quickly, they will save mil-
lions of lives. 
Vladimir Putin’s war is exacerbating 
a global crisis of food insecurity al-
ready set in motion by the COVID pan-
demic and successive years of severe 
drought in Africa. I am extremely dis-
appointed that this bill does not in-
clude new resources to address the on-
going COVID pandemic. 
Last week, we passed the grim toll of 
1 million recorded COVID deaths in our 
country and estimates as high as 20 
million deaths worldwide. If we fail to 
prepare for anticipated surges in the 
fall and winter, as immunity from ex-
isting vaccines wanes and the virus 
continues to mutate, the death toll 
will rise, potentially exponentially.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2515 
May 16, 2022 
For months—for months—the admin-
istration has warned that we do not 
have the necessary vaccines, thera-
peutics, tests, and other resources to 
stay ahead of this virus. We do not 
have enough funding to purchase new 
shots for everybody in the fall, and we 
already will be forced to ration the 
next generation of vaccines—more suit-
ed to variants like Omicron—to only 
those at the highest risk. 
This is not a problem that can be 
solved by flipping a switch. We cannot 
just say that we will appropriate the 
money later in the fall if it is needed. 
In order to produce the tens of millions 
of doses of vaccine that will be nec-
essary, biotech companies need to 
begin to purchase supplies and start 
production before July. This means we 
only have weeks to provide the funding 
to secure these shots in time. 
The same can be said of our testing 
capacity. Unless we act, domestic man-
ufacturing will continue to shut down, 
shifting production to countries like 
China. This will leave us flat-footed 
once again should another COVID vari-
ant wave crash over our country in the 
fall. 
The virus traveled to this country 
from abroad, and that is where new 
variants have also originated. The U.S. 
Agency for International Development, 
which manages our global response to 
the COVID pandemic, has obligated 95 
percent of the funds they have avail-
able. They are running on fumes, and 
they will have no choice but to start 
shutting down their vaccine delivery 
operations if additional funds are not 
forthcoming soon. That means more 
mutations, more variants, more infec-
tions, and more death. 
It is extremely frustrating that, time 
and again, Members on the other side 
of the aisle have pushed this responsi-
bility off. We are out of time. We can-
not defeat this virus with complacency 
or by burying our heads in the sand. It 
remains a global health emergency. 
According to the experts, it is entirely 
possible that we have not seen the 
worst yet. As chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, I will con-
tinue to fight for these urgently needed 
resources in the coming weeks. 
However, the people of Ukraine and 
the millions facing acute food insecu-
rity require the funds in this bill 
today, and I strongly urge the Senate 
to pass it without further delay. 
I yield the floor.

GREATEST GENERATION 
COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S.1596, and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1596) to require the Secretary of 
the Treasury to mint coins in commemora-
tion of the National World War II Memorial 
in Washington, DC, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Rounds-Shaheen sub-
stitute amendment which is at the 
desk be considered and agreed to; that 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 5034), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to, as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The National World War II Memorial 
was dedicated in Washington, DC, on May 29, 
2004, and is located on the east end of the Re-
flecting Pool on the National Mall, opposite 
the Lincoln Memorial and west of the Wash-
ington Monument. 
(2) The dedication of the National World 
War II Memorial was the culmination of a 17- 
year effort that started on December 10, 1987 
when the World War II Memorial Act was 
first introduced in the House of Representa-
tives, and was authorized by an Act of Con-
gress signed into law on May 25, 1993. Con-
struction began September 4, 2001, after sev-
eral years of fundraising and public hearings. 
(3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, 
the World War II Memorial is the first na-
tional memorial dedicated to all who served 
during World War II and acknowledges the 
commitment and achievement of the entire 
Nation. 
(4) The Memorial honors the more than 
16,000,000 who served in the Armed Forces of 
the United States during World War II, the 
more than 400,000 who died, and the millions 
who supported the war effort from home. 
(5) It is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, 
and commitment of the American people to 
the common defense of the Nation and to the 
broader causes of peace and freedom from 
tyranny throughout the world. 
(6) Today, the Memorial is a top destina-
tion for millions of annual visitors from all 
over the country and the world. For many 
young visitors, their visit to the Memorial is 
a first glimpse to a grateful Nation’s remem-
brance of the sacrifices made by the World 
War II generation.

(7) For World War II veterans, the Memo-
rial is a special destination, a rendezvous 
point, and a gathering place for reunions and 
commemoration programs. 
(8) The Friends of the National World War 
II Memorial play a vital role in the preserva-
tion and maintenance of the National World 
War II Memorial as a treasure for the Amer-
ican people, while helping to facilitate key

erty.

NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL 
REGULATIONS 
PURSUANT 
TO 
THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT 
MAY 16, 2022. 
Hon. PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President Pro Tempore of the Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: On May 10, 2022, the 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1096, thereby approving the regula-
tions adopted by the Board of Directors of 
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights 
that 
were 
promulgated 
under 
section 
220(e)(1) of the Congressional Accountability 
Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. § 1351(e)(1), to the extent 
such regulations are consistent with the pro-
visions of the CAA. The approved regulations 
govern unionizing and collective bargaining 
rights in the House offices listed in section 
220(e)(2) of the CAA. 
Section 304 of the CAA, (2 U.S.C. § 1384) pro-
vides that, after congressional approval of 
substantive regulations, the Board shall sub-
mit the regulations to the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and the President 
pro tempore of the Senate. Accordingly, on 
behalf of the Board of Directors of the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights, I am 
transmitting the enclosed Notice of Issuance 
of Final Regulations, together with a copy of 
the final regulations. 
The CAA further specifies that the en-
closed notice be published in the Congres-
sional Record on the first day on which both 
the House and the Senate are in session fol-
lowing this transmittal. Because the ap-
proved regulations only govern rights in the 
House offices listed in section 220(e)(2) of the 
CAA, the Board requests publication only in 
the Congressional Record for the House. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA CHILDS WALLACE, 
Chair of the Board of Directors, 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. 
Attachment. 
NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (CAA) was enacted into law on January 
23, 1995. In general, the CAA applies the 
rights and protections of 14 federal labor and 
employment law statutes to covered congres-
sional employees and employing offices. Sec-
tion 220 of the CAA addresses the application 
of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code 
(chapter 71), relating to Federal Service 
Labor-Management Relations. Section 220(a) 
of the CAA applies the rights, protections, 
and responsibilities established under sec-
tions 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, 7119 
through 7122, and 7131 of chapter 71 to em-
ploying offices, covered employees, and rep-
resentatives of covered employees. 
Section 220(d) of the Act requires the 
Board of Directors of the Office of Congres-
sional Workplace Rights (Board) to issue 
regulations to implement section 220. The 
Board adopted final regulations under sec-
tion 220(d) on July 9, 1996; Congress subse-
quently approved those regulations; and they 
became effective on November 30, 1996. 
Section 220(e)(1) of the CAA further re-
quires that the Board issue regulations ‘‘on 
the manner and extent to which the require-
ments and exemptions of chapter 71 . . . 
should apply to covered employees who are 
employed in the offices listed in’’ section 
220(e)(2). The offices listed in section 220(e)(2) 
include: 
(A) the personal office of any Member of 
the House of Representatives; 
(B) a standing, select, special, permanent, 
temporary, or other committee of the House 
of Representatives; 
(C) the Office of the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, the Office of the Major-
ity Leader of the House of Representatives, 
the Office of the Minority Leader of the 
House of Representatives, the Offices of the 
Chief Deputy Majority Whips, the Offices of 
the Chief Deputy Minority Whips, and the 
following offices within the Office of the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: Of-
fices of Legislative Operations, Official Re-
porters of Debate, Official Reporters to Com-
mittees, Printing Services, and Legislative 
Information; 
(D) the Office of the Legislative Counsel of 
the House of Representatives, the Office of 
the General Counsel of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Office of the Parliamen-
tarian of the House of Representatives, and 
the Office of the Law Revision Counsel; 
(E) the offices of any caucus or party orga-
nization within the House of Representa-
tives; 
(F) the Office of the Majority Whip of the 
House of Representatives, the Office of the 
Minority Whip of the House of Representa-
tives, the Office of House Employment Coun-
sel, the Immediate Office of the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives, the Immediate Of-
fice of the Chief Administrative Officer of 
the House of Representatives, the Office of 
Legislative Computer Systems of the House 
of Representatives, the Office of Finance of 
the House of Representatives, and the Imme-
diate Office of the Sergeant at Arms of the 
House of Representatives. 
On August 19, 1996, the Board, pursuant to 
section 220(e)(1), adopted and submitted for 
publication in the Congressional Record Reg-
ulations Relating to the House of Represent-
atives and Its Employing Offices, which are 
attached to this Notice. On May 10, 2022, the 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1096, thereby approving these regula-
tions to the extent such regulations are con-
sistent with the provisions of the CAA. 
Section 220(f)(2) of the CAA provides that, 
‘‘[w]ith respect to the offices listed in sub-
section (e)(2), to the covered employees of 
such offices, and to representatives of such 
employees, [section 220] shall be effective on 
the effective date of regulations under sub-
section (e).’’ Pursuant to section 304 of the 
CAA, 2 U.S.C. § 1384, approved regulations be-
come effective not less than 60 days after the 
date on which they are published in the Con-
gressional Record. Although the Board has 
the authority to provide for an earlier effec-
tive date for good cause found, the Board 
does not find good cause to provide for an 
earlier effective date for these regulations. 
Therefore, these regulations will become ef-
fective 60 days after the date on which they 
are published in the Congressional Record. 
Accordingly, having now been approved by 
the House, the Board submits its regulations 
to the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives for publication in the Congressional 
Record.

Chair of the Board of Directors,

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNI-
VERSITY 
OF 
CONNECTICUT 
SCHOOL OF LAW 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize the University 
of Connecticut School of Law as it 
celebrates 100 years of extraordinary 
legal education. 
In 1921, George William Lillard and 
Caroline Eiermann Lillard founded the 
Hartford College of Law to provide 
Hartford insurance company employees 
with a legal education. Among the 
members of the first graduating class 
was Miss J. Agnes Burns, who was the 
first female attorney to present to the 
Connecticut Supreme Court. 
The college continued to grow during 
the 1930s, even amid unstable economic 
times. It reached a student body of 100 
part-time night students with three 
full-time instructors. In September 
1933, the American Bar Association— 
ABA—approved the college, and the ex-
amining committee of the Connecticut

Bar Association accredited the institu-
tion. The Hartford College of Law also 
appointed their first full-time dean, 
Thomas A. Larremore. Within the dec-
ade, the school amended the charter to 
organize the college as a nonprofit edu-
cational corporation and added the day 
division program to allow for full-time 
study. 
During World War II, when enroll-
ment dropped dramatically, the Uni-
versity of Connecticut, based in Storrs, 
CT, agreed to take responsibility for 
the Hartford College of Law to prevent 
it from closing. The initial lease was 
for 5 years, and the full title was con-
veyed to the university on September 
1, 1948, renaming the college as the 
University of Connecticut School of 
Law. The first class at the newly estab-
lished school of law was also the first 
class to have all of its members pass 
the State bar. 
In 1964, a new home for the law 
school was opened, with a modern look 
designed by the architect of the Storrs 
campus’ renowned Jorgensen Audito-
rium, Frederic C. Teich. The West 
Hartford News called the law school’s 
new campus reveal a ‘‘most significant 
event in our state’s history.’’ The open-
ing received an entire section in the 
local newspaper, including a two-page 
photo layout and an article praising 
the building’s lighting and the library’s 
book collection and technological ele-
ments. 
With the new building came a 40-per-
cent increase in admissions. Soon, the 
new building was overflowing, and by 
the late 1970s, the ABA expressed con-
cerns about the facilities meeting ac-
creditation standards. In June 1978, 
Governor Ella Grasso signed legislation 
that allowed for the purchase and ren-
ovation of the then empty Hartford 
Seminary campus to accommodate the 
increased demand for legal education. 
The law school remains at that loca-
tion, housed in a beautiful campus, 
with ornate structures befitting a cen-
tury old, august institution. 
Since its founding, the University of 
Connecticut School of Law has grown 
exponentially in both size and stature. 
It opened its first clinic, the Criminal 
Clinic, in 1969. Further degree pro-
grams were also established: in 1994, its 
first LLM program, in U.S. legal stud-
ies; and in 2013, the doctor of the 
science of laws program. 
Many illustrious alumni have entered 
public service, working on behalf of the 
State and the Nation. Others have con-
tributed to the ongoing evolution of 
the law, especially in areas such as 
property, tax, and insurance law. The 
law school, through its clinics, has as-
sisted many Connecticut residents who 
otherwise could not afford lawyers. 
As the former Connecticut Attorney 
General, I can attest to the fact that 
many of the assistant attorneys gen-
eral, who graduated from the law 
school, provided the State with dedi-
cated and insightful legal representa-
tion. 
On October 25, 2021, hundreds of stu-
dents, alumni, faculty, and staff cele-
brated Founders’ Day, in honor of the 
Lillards. The event began a yearlong 
celebration, which culminates on June 
11, 2022, with the centennial gala. 
The University of Connecticut School 
of Law has had an immeasurable im-
pact on our State and countless resi-
dents. As the school celebrates its cen-
tennial, I applaud its exemplary record 
of success and achievement. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in congratu-
lating the University of Connecticut 
School of Law on 100 years of excel-
lence.∑

TRIBUTE TO STEVEN E. BERGER 
∑ Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the legacy and impact 
of Steve Berger, follower of Christ and 
beloved pastor, leader, mentor, and 
friend. 
Since Steve was called to serve the 
ministry more than 30 years ago, he 
has been a giant in the faith. His pas-
sion, his boldness, and his resolve in 
spreading love and the glory of God has 
been an inspiration to so many, and 
has truly been a force for good in our 
community. 
I commend the devotion to faith that 
marks Steve’s life and has marked the 
lives of many others in turn. Through 
Steve’s courageous preaching and wise 
leadership, Grace Chapel has tran-
scended the walls of the local church 
and has seen such success across our 
great State. 
Steve has always been one to lead by 
example, constantly showing his re-
lentless love for the hurting, oppressed, 
and impoverished across the globe. 
Steve’s profound devotion has taken 
him to some of the farthest comers of 
the world to serve, help, and save those 
who are suffering. Steve has brokered 
peace in war-torn countries and has 
been a faithful, generous, and loving 
friend to Israel. He has brought God’s 
healing to the wounded, His Word to 
the burdened, His sustenance to the 
poor, and His hope to the persecuted. 
And so it is with a glad and grateful 
heart that today I rise to affirm and 
honor the tremendous influence of 
Steve Berger.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN, and Ms. WARREN): 
S. 4221. A bill to amend title 5, 
United States Code, to achieve parity 
between the cost-of-living adjustment 
with respect to an annuity under the 
Federal Employees Retirement System 
and an annuity under the Civil Service 
Retirement System, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Equal COLA 
Act, which I introduced today. 
The Federal Government’s workforce 
is central to protecting our national 
security and delivering critical serv-
ices to hundreds of millions of Ameri-
cans. As such, it is essential that the 
Federal Government attract and retain 
an effective workforce and, once their 
service is complete, ensure retirees re-
ceive the dignified retirement that 
they deserve. 
Unfortunately, in 1986, Congress cre-
ated a two-tiered system that now pre-
vents nearly 800,000 retired Federal em-
ployees from receiving a full cost-of- 
living 
adjustment 
when 
consumer 
prices increase more than 2 percent 
from year to year. 
In January, some Federal retirees re-
ceived 5.9 percent COLA. However, 
other Federal retirees received only a 
4.9 percent increase due to this policy, 
which fails to protect retired employ-
ees who are living on a fixed income. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this legislation to fix this unfair sys-
tem and ensure that all retired Federal 
employees receive full retirement bene-
fits that keep up with the cost of liv-
ing. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill to ensure that re-
tired Federal employees no longer pay 
the price of a misguided law and that 
their benefits fully keep pace with the 
cost of living.

KARA-

WHO 
WAS

DETAINED ON APRIL 11, 2022

Mr. RISCH, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. WICKER, 
Mr. CARDIN, Mr. JOHNSON, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, Mr. SULLIVAN, and Mr. GRASS-
LEY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 632 
Whereas Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara- 
Murza (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘Mr. 
Kara-Murza’’) has tirelessly worked for dec-
ades to advance the cause of freedom, democ-
racy, and human rights for the people of the 
Russian Federation; 
Whereas, in retaliation for his advocacy, 
two attempts have been made on Mr. Kara- 
Murza’s life, as— 
(1) on May 26, 2015, Mr. Kara-Murza fell ill 
with symptoms indicative of poisoning and 
was hospitalized; and 
(2) on February 2, 2017, he fell ill with simi-
lar symptoms and was placed in a medically 
induced coma; 
Whereas independent investigations con-
ducted by Bellingcat, the Insider, and Der 
Spiegel found that the same unit of the Fed-
eral Security Service of the Russian Federa-
tion responsible for poisoning Mr. Kara- 
Murza was responsible for poisoning Russian 
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and activ-
ists 
Timur 
Kuashev, 
Ruslan 
Magomedragimov, and Nikita Isayev; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Vladimir 
Putin launched another unprovoked, unjusti-
fied, and illegal invasion into Ukraine in 
contravention of the obligations freely un-
dertaken by the Russian Federation to re-
spect the territorial integrity of Ukraine 
under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the 
Minsk protocols of 2014 and 2015, and inter-
national law; 
Whereas, on March 5, 2022, Vladimir Putin 
signed a law criminalizing the distribution of 
truthful statements about the invasion of 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation and man-
dating up to 15 years in prison for such of-
fenses; 
Whereas, since February 24, 2022, Mr. Kara- 
Murza has used his voice and platform to 
join more than 15,000 citizens of the Russian 
Federation in peacefully protesting the war 
against Ukraine and millions more who si-
lently oppose the war; 
Whereas, on April 11, 2022, five police offi-
cers arrested Mr. Kara-Murza in front of his 
home and denied his right to an attorney, 
and the next day Mr. Kara-Murza was sen-
tenced to 15 days in prison for disobeying a 
police order; 
Whereas, on April 22, 2022, the Investiga-
tive Committee of the Russian Federation 
charged Mr. Kara-Murza with violations 
under the law signed on March 5, 2022, for his 
fact-based statements condemning the inva-
sion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation; 
Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza was then placed 
into pretrial detention and ordered to be 
held until at least June 12, 2022; and 
Whereas, if convicted of those charges, Mr. 
Kara-Murza faces detention in a penitentiary 
system that human rights nongovernmental 
organizations have criticized for widespread 
torture, ill-treatment, and suspicious deaths 
of prisoners: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

(2) expresses solidarity with Vladimir

imprisoned for opposing the regime of Vladi-

(4) calls on the President to increase sup-

Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. 
HAWLEY) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 633 
Whereas the Senate has always honored 
the sacrifices made by the wounded and ill 
members of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas the Silver Star Service Banner 
has come to represent the members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans who were wound-
ed or became ill in combat in the wars 
fought by the United States; 
Whereas the Silver Star Families of Amer-
ica was formed to help the people of the 
United States remember the sacrifices made 
by the wounded and ill members of the 
Armed Forces by designing and manufac-
turing Silver Star Service Banners and Sil-
ver Star Flags for that purpose; 
Whereas the sole mission of the Silver Star 
Families of America is to evoke memories of 
the sacrifices made by members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans on behalf of the 
United States through the presence of a Sil-
ver Star Service Banner in a window or a Sil-
ver Star Flag flying; 
Whereas the sacrifices made by members of 
the Armed Forces and veterans on behalf of 
the United States should never be forgotten; 
and 
Whereas May 1, 2022, is an appropriate date 
to designate as ‘‘Silver Star Service Banner 
Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 1, 2022, 
as ‘‘Silver Star Service Banner Day’’; and 
(2) calls upon the people of the United 
States to observe Silver Star Service Banner 
Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies,

tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 634 
Whereas National Foster Care Month was 
established more than 30 years ago to— 
(1) bring foster care issues to the forefront; 
(2) highlight the importance of perma-
nency for every child; and 
(3) recognize the essential role that foster 
parents, social workers, and advocates have 
in the lives of children in foster care 
throughout the United States; 
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, 
and permanent home; 
Whereas the primary goal of the foster 
care system is to ensure the safety and well- 
being of children while working to provide a 
safe, loving, and permanent home for each 
child; 
Whereas there are approximately 407,000 
children living in foster care in the United 
States; 
Whereas there were approximately 216,000 
youths that entered the foster care system 
in 2020 in the United States, while more than 
117,000 youths were awaiting adoption at the 
end of 2020; 
Whereas more than 75,000 children entered 
foster care in 2020 due to parental drug 
abuse; 
Whereas children of color are more likely 
to stay in the foster care system for longer 
periods of time and are less likely to be re-
united with their biological families; 
Whereas foster parents are the front-line 
caregivers for children who cannot safely re-
main with their biological parents, and fos-
ter parents provide physical care, emotional 
support, and education advocacy, and are the 
largest single source of families providing 
permanent homes for children leaving foster 
care to adoption; 
Whereas children in foster care who are 
placed with relatives, compared to children 
placed with non-relatives— 
(1) have more stability, including fewer 
changes in placements; 
(2) have more positive perceptions of their 
placements; 
(3) are more likely to be placed with their 
siblings; and 
(4) demonstrate fewer behavioral problems; 
Whereas some relative caregivers receive 
less financial assistance and support services 
than do foster caregivers; 
Whereas an increased emphasis on preven-
tion and reunification services is necessary 
to reduce the number of children that enter 
or re-enter the foster care system; 
Whereas the impact of the COVID–19 pan-
demic created additional challenges for 
youth and families in the child welfare sys-
tem, including delays in permanency, eco-
nomic hardship, and disruptions in edu-
cation; 
Whereas more than 20,000 youths aged out 
of foster care in 2020 without a legal perma-
nent connection to an adult or family; 
Whereas youth who age out of foster care 
lack the security or support of a biological 
or adoptive family and frequently struggle to 
secure affordable housing, obtain health in-
surance, pursue higher education, and ac-
quire adequate employment; 
Whereas foster care is intended to be a 
temporary placement, but children remain 
in the foster care system for an average of 21 
months; 
Whereas 35 percent of children in foster 
care experience more than 2 placements 
while in care, which often leads to disruption 
of routines and the need to change schools 
and move away from siblings, extended fami-
lies, and familiar surroundings; 
Whereas youth in foster care are much 
more likely to face educational instability 
with a study showing that 75 percent of fos-
ter youth experienced an unscheduled school 
change during a school year, compared to 21 
percent of youth not in foster care; 
Whereas children entering foster care often 
confront the widespread misperception that 
children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, 
and dangerous, even though placement in 
foster care is based on the actions of a par-
ent or guardian, not the child; 
Whereas 30 percent of children in foster 
care are taking not less than 1 anti-psy-
chotic medication, and 34 percent of those 
children are not receiving adequate treat-
ment planning or medication monitoring; 
Whereas, due to heavy caseloads and lim-
ited resources, the average annual turnover 
rate is between 14 percent and 22 percent for 
child welfare workers; 
Whereas States, localities, and commu-
nities should be encouraged to invest re-
sources in preventative and reunification 
services and post-permanency programs to 
ensure that more children and older youth in 
foster care are provided with safe, loving, 
and permanent placements; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress passed the Fam-
ily First Prevention Services Act (Public 
Law 115–123; 132 Stat. 232), which provided 
new investments in prevention and family 
reunification services to help more families 
stay together and ensure more children are 
in safe, loving, and permanent homes; 
Whereas Federal legislation during the 
past 3 decades, including the Adoption As-
sistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub-
lic Law 96–272; 94 Stat. 500), the Adoption and 
Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–89; 
111 Stat. 2115), the Fostering Connections to 
Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 
(Public Law 110–351; 122 Stat. 3949), the Child 
and Family Services Improvement and Inno-
vation Act (Public Law 112–34; 125 Stat. 369), 
and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and 
Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113– 
183; 128 Stat. 1919) provided new investments 
and services to improve the outcomes of 
children in the foster care system; 
Whereas May 2022 is an appropriate month 
to designate as National Foster Care Month 
to provide an opportunity to acknowledge 
the accomplishments of the child welfare 
workforce, foster parents, advocacy commu-
nity, and mentors for their dedication, ac-
complishments, and positive impact they 
have on the lives of children; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to en-
sure that all children have a safe, loving, 
nurturing, and permanent family, regardless 
of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2022 as 
National Foster Care Month; 
(2) recognizes National Foster Care Month 
as an opportunity to raise awareness about 
the challenges that children face in the fos-
ter care system; 
(3) encourages Congress to implement poli-
cies to improve the lives of children in the 
foster care system; 
(4) acknowledges the unique needs of chil-
dren in the foster care system; 
(5) recognizes foster youth throughout the 
United States for their ongoing tenacity, 
courage, and resilience while facing life chal-
lenges; 
(6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of 
the foster care system who serve as advo-
cates and role models for youth who remain 
in care;

SENATE RESOLUTION 635—DESIG-
NATING 
MAY 
2022 
AS 
‘‘ALS 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. COTTON (for himself, Mr. WHITE-
HOUSE, Mr. BRAUN, and Mr. COONS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 635 
Whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘ALS’’) is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal 
cord; 
Whereas the life expectancy for an indi-
vidual with ALS is between 2 and 5 years 
after the date on which the individual re-
ceives an ALS diagnosis; 
Whereas ALS occurs throughout the world 
with no racial, ethnic, gender, or socio-
economic boundaries; 
Whereas ALS may affect any individual in 
any location; 
Whereas the cause of ALS is unknown in 
up to 90 percent of cases; 
Whereas approximately 10 percent of ALS 
cases have a strong known genetic driver; 
Whereas, on average, the period between 
the date on which an individual first experi-
ences symptoms of ALS and the date on 
which the individual is diagnosed with ALS 
is more than 1 year; 
Whereas the onset of ALS often involves 
muscle weakness or stiffness, and the pro-
gression of ALS results in the further weak-
ening, wasting, and paralysis of— 
(1) the muscles of the limbs and trunk; and 
(2) the muscles that control vital func-
tions, such as speech, swallowing, and 
breathing; 
Whereas ALS can strike individuals of any 
age, but it predominantly strikes adults; 
Whereas it is estimated that tens of thou-
sands of individuals in the United States 
have ALS at any given time; 
Whereas, based on studies of the popu-
lation of the United States, slightly more 
than 5,000 individuals in the United States 
are diagnosed with ALS each year, and 15 in-
dividuals in the United States are diagnosed 
with ALS each day; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2040, the number 
of ALS cases around the world is expected to 
increase by nearly 70 percent; 
Whereas the majority of individuals with 
ALS die of respiratory failure; 
Whereas, in the United States, military 
veterans are approximately twice as likely 
to be diagnosed with ALS than the general 
public; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, there is no cure for ALS; 
Whereas the spouses, children, and family 
members of individuals living with ALS pro-
vide support to those individuals with love, 
day-to-day care, and more; and 
Whereas an individual with ALS, and the 
caregivers of such an individual, can be re-
quired to bear significant costs for medical 
care, equipment, and home care services for 
the individual as the disease progresses: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2022 as ‘‘ALS Awareness 
Month’’; 
(2) affirms the dedication of the Senate 
to— 
(A) ensuring individuals with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (referred to in this resolving 
clause as ‘‘ALS’’) have access to effective 
treatments as soon as possible; 
(B) identifying risk factors and causes of 
ALS to prevent new cases; 
(C) empowering individuals with ALS to 
engage with the world in the way they want; 
(D) reducing the physical, emotional, and 
financial burdens of living with ALS; and 
(E) ensuring all individuals with ALS and 
their caregivers receive high quality services 
and supports that benefit them; and 
(3) commends the dedication of the family 
members, friends, organizations, volunteers, 
researchers, and caregivers across the United 
States who are working to improve the qual-
ity and length of life of ALS patients and the 
development of treatments and cures that 
reach patients as soon as possible.

SENATE RESOLUTION 636—URGING 
THE 
DEVELOPMENT 
OF 
A 
STRATEGY 
TO 
COUNTER 
THE 
RISE IN VIOLENT CRIME ACROSS 
THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. 
CASSIDY

himself, 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY, Mr. BARRASSO, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. BRAUN, Mrs.

RUBIO, Mr. SASSE, Mr. SCOTT of Flor-
ida, Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. WICKER, and 
Mr. YOUNG) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 636 
Whereas rising crime, especially violent 
crime, in the United States poses a threat to 
the national interest, as well as to the safety 
and security of individuals, communities, 
businesses, law enforcement officers, and the 
rule of law; 
Whereas, for the purposes of the Uniform 
Crime Reporting Program of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, violent crimes consist 
of offenses that involve force or the threat of 
force, namely— 
(1) 
murder 
and 
non-negligent 
man-
slaughter; 
(2) forcible rape; 
(3) robbery; and 
(4) aggravated assault; 
Whereas 
violent 
crimes 
are 
occurring 
every day in major cities across the United 
States in part due to progressive prosecutors 
declining to charge violent offenders and cer-
tain bail reform policies allowing dangerous 
criminals back into society; 
Whereas released offenders go on to com-
mit more violent crimes and inflict more 
terror and death on other individuals in the 
United States; 
Whereas rising violent crime destroys fam-
ilies and should be combated by criminal jus-
tice systems that prosecute the offenders as 
offenders, and not as victims; 
Whereas the murder rate in the United 
States rose 30 percent between 2019 and 2020, 
the largest single-year increase in more than 
a century; 
Whereas there was a 59 percent increase in 
murders of police officers in 2021; 
Whereas, as of April 1, 2022, 101 police offi-
cers had been shot this year, 17 of whom were 
killed by gunfire; 
Whereas at least 16 cities in the United 
States set murder records in 2021; 
Whereas organized retail crime threats in 
2020 cost retailers an average of $720,000 for 
every $1,000,000,000 in sales, and 69 percent of 
retailers surveyed in 2021 had seen an in-
crease in organized retail crime in 2021; 
Whereas organized retail crime threatens 
the safety of retail workers as organized 
crime groups, gangs, and individuals use 
weapons other than guns, such as mace 
chemical spray and Taser stun guns, to rob 
and assault hard-working retail employees; 
Whereas rising violent crime in the United 
States can be directly correlated to a surge 
in illegal immigration at the southern bor-
der of the United States and a surge in the 
sale, distribution, and consumption of illegal 
drugs; 
Whereas, in December 2021, 178,840 illegal 
immigrants were apprehended attempting to 
cross the United States-Mexico border, the 
highest total for December in the history of 
the Department of Homeland Security, and a 
142 percent increase from December 2020; 
Whereas more than 2,500,000 illegal immi-
grants have been caught attempting to cross 
the United States-Mexico border since Janu-
ary 2021, with more apprehended in the 3- 
month period from November 2021 through 
January 2022 than in all of fiscal year 2020; 
Whereas 461 pounds of fentanyl were seized 
at the southern border in December 2021 
alone, enough to kill more than 30 percent of 
the United States population; 
Whereas drug cartels have overburdened 
Border Patrol resources by surging illegal 
immigrants into strategic locations so that 
the cartels can traffic narcotics and other 
contraband into the United States unde-
tected; 
Whereas violent crimes related to illegal 
immigration and the illegal drug trade must 
stop for the sake of the sovereignty of the 
United States and the safety of the people of 
the United States; 
Whereas, with overdose deaths at an all- 
time high, every State is a border State, as 
the flow of illegal drugs from the United 
States-Mexico border puts all States at risk 
regardless of proximity to the border; 
Whereas securing the southern border and 
ensuring the safety of citizens of the United 
States is one of the most important respon-
sibilities of the Federal Government; 
Whereas the current Administration’s al-
leged violent crime reduction strategy is ac-
tually a gun control strategy and wrongly 
puts lawful gun owners and dealers at the 
center of enforcement efforts instead of fo-
cusing on the criminals perpetuating vio-
lence, insecurity, and fear across the United 
States; 
Whereas the same gun violence reduction 
strategy unfairly puts the blame for gun vio-
lence in major, Democrat-run cities and

States on neighboring States with lower 
crime rates; and 
Whereas violent crimes can only be com-
bated if the Department of Justice, the De-
partment of Homeland Security, other law 
enforcement agencies, and the private sector 
work together: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the President should work with Con-
gress to develop and execute a strategy, 
drawing on the multiple instruments of 
power and resources of the United States— 
(1) to counter the rise in violent crime 
across the country by reinforcing strong 
criminal justice policies, by laying blame on 
the perpetrators of violent acts, and by se-
curing the southern border; and 
(2) to coordinate with Federal, State, and 
local agencies and authorities to— 
(A) implement the strategy; and 
(B) exhort all those agencies and authori-
ties to strengthen their approaches to com-
bat the violent crime epidemic within the 
country.

essary to reduce the total amount of such 
unobligated balances by an amount equal to

SA 5034. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. 
ROUNDS
(for himself and Mrs. SHA-
HEEN)) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 1596, to require the Secretary of 
the Treasury to mint coins in com-
memoration of the National World War 
II Memorial in Washington, DC, and for 
other purposes; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The National World War II Memorial 
was dedicated in Washington, DC, on May 29, 
2004, and is located on the east end of the Re-
flecting Pool on the National Mall, opposite 
the Lincoln Memorial and west of the Wash-
ington Monument. 
(2) The dedication of the National World 
War II Memorial was the culmination of a 17- 
year effort that started on December 10, 1987 
when the World War II Memorial Act was 
first introduced in the House of Representa-
tives, and was authorized by an Act of Con-
gress signed into law on May 25, 1993. Con-
struction began September 4, 2001, after sev-
eral years of fundraising and public hearings. 
(3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, 
the World War II Memorial is the first na-
tional memorial dedicated to all who served 
during World War II and acknowledges the 
commitment and achievement of the entire 
Nation. 
(4) The Memorial honors the more than 
16,000,000 who served in the Armed Forces of 
the United States during World War II, the 
more than 400,000 who died, and the millions 
who supported the war effort from home. 
(5) It is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, 
and commitment of the American people to 
the common defense of the Nation and to the 
broader causes of peace and freedom from 
tyranny throughout the world. 
(6) Today, the Memorial is a top destina-
tion for millions of annual visitors from all 
over the country and the world. For many 
young visitors, their visit to the Memorial is 
a first glimpse to a grateful Nation’s remem-
brance of the sacrifices made by the World 
War II generation. 
(7) For World War II veterans, the Memo-
rial is a special destination, a rendezvous 
point, and a gathering place for reunions and 
commemoration programs. 
(8) The Friends of the National World War 
II Memorial play a vital role in the preserva-
tion and maintenance of the National World 
War II Memorial as a treasure for the Amer-
ican people, while helping to facilitate key 
commemorative and educational programs 
at the Memorial to pay tribute to America’s 
‘‘Greatest Generation’’ and their efforts to 
preserve liberty for generations to come. 
(9) The National World War II Memorial 
stands as an important symbol of America’s 
national unity, a timeless reminder of the 
moral strength and power that flows when 
free people are at once united and bonded to-
gether in a common and just cause for lib-
erty.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
VOL-
UNTEERISM OF PUERTO RICO’S 
WOUNDED 
WARRIOR 
PROJECT 
LEADERS 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the selfless local 
leaders of Puerto Rico’s Wounded Warrior 
Project and the contributions they make to-
ward improving the lives of active-duty service 
members, veterans, and their families. 
The Wounded Warrior Project was founded 
in 2003 with a unique, non-partisan mission: to 
support those who have born the cost of war, 
whether their injury be physical or mental. No-
where are these services needed more than 
Puerto Rico, where servicemembers and vet-
erans alike face extra hurdles to accessing the 
care they need to recover from the sacrifices 
they made on behalf of our country. 
Despite these barriers, local leaders at the 
Wounded Warrior Project have led the way. 
Over the past year they have hosted 38 
events for warriors and family members. This 
resulted in more than 385 engagements that 
helped heal, connect, and empower our post 
9–11 veterans living in Puerto Rico. This past 
weekend they served their community again 
by holding an expo this Saturday that edu-
cated veterans on VA benefits, employment 
opportunities, and healthcare access. I want to 
thank the local peer support leaders and na-
tional staff who made this happen and who 
continue their selfless service to country and 
community.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during the solemn occasion of National Police 
Week to recognize the law enforcement offi-
cers across our nation who lost their lives in 
the line of duty. Every day, police officers put 
on their badges and go into their communities 
to carry out their mission to protect and serve. 
Tragically, some do not return to their families 
at the end of the day. 
This year, the names of 619 officers have 
been added to the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C.—in-
cluding four from Ohio. They are Toledo Po-
lice Officer Brandon Stalker, Cleveland Police 
Officer Shane Bartek, Hamilton County Deputy 
Sheriff Donald Gilreath, and Ohio Department 
of Natural Resources Officer Jason Lagore. 
Their legacies will live on in the hearts of all 
Americans and at the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial here in Washington, 
D.C. We are perpetually indebted to them for 
their service, courage, and patriotism. Today 
and always, let us honor their memories and 
hold their loved ones close in our hearts and 
prayers.

HONORING

2022 
UNITED 
STATES 
SERVICE 
ACADEMY- 
BOUND STUDENTS 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today it is 
my great honor to come before my colleagues 
to recognize the distinguished young men and 
women of Texas’ Third Congressional District 
who have accepted an appointment to one of 
our prestigious United States Service Acad-
emies. I congratulate these patriots as they 
prepare to undertake a mission of service and 
wish them great success as they meet the 
challenges set before them. 
The United States Service Academies are 
widely known for seeking out candidates who 
excel academically, athletically, and civically, 
while exhibiting outstanding leadership quali-
ties. Only a select few meet the stringent cri-
teria set forth by these renowned institutions, 
and those students who ultimately receive an 
appointment benefit from the highest caliber of 
education and military officer training in the 
world. Therefore, I am confident these young 
leaders will represent Texas’ Third Congres-
sional District with honor as they are refined 
by the fire and pushed to the limits while they 
train to lead our Nation. 
The years will come with challenges as they 
are equipped with the necessary tools to de-
fend our democracy. But in the end, these 
young men and women will carry forth the 
same torch as countless generations before 
them have done—embodying the qualities of 
service before self, sacrifice, purpose and a 
life lived on mission. 
It is with gratitude and hope that I thank 
these young men and women for their cour-
age, conviction, and commitment to America. 
Now, as they embark on a new mission of 
service, I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring them for their commitment to excellence 
and their defense of liberty.

SUMMER SHADE 150TH 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I stand today 
to honor and celebrate the 150th anniversary 
of the small town of Summer Shade, Kentucky 
in Metcalfe County. 
Home to just a few hundred people in the 
southwestern comer of Metcalfe County, Sum-
mer Shade is known for its strong sense of 
community spirit. Its unique name is thought to 
be derived from the large trees that once pro-
tected the town from nearby wildlife. 
With loyal, hard-working locals and a town 
full of character and tradition, Summer Shade 
is a prime example of the values that our state 
and country stand for. 
A rural and close-knit community at heart, 
Summer Shade is marked by its beautiful land 
and caring citizens. 
As this town commemorates 150 years of 
establishment, I want to thank the citizens of 
Summer Shade for their patriotism and com-
munity pride. I am honored to represent them 
in Congress, and fight for the values that we 
hold dear.

Today, we recognize an answered prayer—

This is a monumental achievement, but it is

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
REVEREND JESSE TURNER 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Pine Bluff native, Reverend 
Jesse Turner. Reverend Turner is the Presi-
dent of the Pine Bluff Faith Community Coali-
tion Ministerial Alliance and a staunch sup-
porter and leader of the ‘‘Pen or Pencil’’ pro-
gram, which promotes a national mentoring 
initiative to reach students in violence-prone 
areas. 
Reverend Turner’s program has success-
fully 
served 
young 
adults 
whose 
cir-
cumstances have put them at risk for entry 
into the criminal justice system. Since 2005, 
the Pen or Pencil program is now in 12 states 
and 15 locations. It has enhanced and ex-
panded mentoring services for youth to 
choose the ‘‘pencil’’ for education rather than 
the ‘‘pen’’ for the penitentiary. 
Choosing education and a life committed to 
good when the community around you is suf-
fering takes great courage, and it takes great 
leaders. Reverend Turner is such a leader in 
Pine Bluff, and all who have taken part in his 
ministry through the Alliance or through Pen or 
Pencil know that his work makes a difference. 
I thank Reverend Turner for the good work 
he has done for generations of Fourth District 
Arkansans.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE 
HONORABLE NORMAN Y. MINETA 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 11, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to honor and 
mourn former Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, 
My thoughts and sympathies are with his wife 
Deni, his children Stuart, David, Mark and 
Bob, and his family and friends. He was a 
truly remarkable, trailblazing individual who 
became one of the most prominent Asian 
American figures in our country. His legacy in-
cluded many firsts, and his life was a source 
of inspiration, a testament to the American 
spirit of fighting for justice and equality. 
I met Norm when I was working for the late, 
beloved Congressman Ron Dellums. Norm 
was very kind to me, taught me a lot, listened 
to my ideas, and was a close friend of Ron’s. 
In many ways, he was a mentor to me. Later, 
when I became a member of Congress, he al-
ways sought me out to tell me how proud he 
was of me. Such support coming from this 
giant of a man, always humbled me. I always 
told him how much he influenced my life, and 
I was deeply grateful for his friendship. 
His success did not come without sacrifice. 
When Secretary Mineta was ten years old, our 
government forcibly removed him and his fam-
ily from their home in San Jose to a World 
War 
II 
Japanese 
American 
incarceration 
camp, the Heart Mountain camp in Wyoming. 
Decades later, he led the passage of the 1988 
Civil Liberties Act, which granted reparations 
and a formal apology to Japanese Americans 
wrongfully incarcerated by our govenunent 
solely on the basis of race, due to President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s issuance of Executive 
Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. 
Having endured such blatant racism and 
discrimination against Japanese Americans, 
he understood the importance of fighting for 
people who never had a voice in our political 
process. Throughout his career, he was the 
first Asian American mayor of San Jose, the 
first Japanese American member of Congress 
from the lower 48 states, and the first Asian 
American Cabinet Member, serving as both 
the Secretary of Commerce for President Clin-
ton and Secretary of Transportation for Presi-
dent Bush. In 2006, he received the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom for his achieve-
ments. 
During his time in Congress, Secretary Mi-
neta co-founded the Congressional Asian Pa-
cific American Caucus (CAPAC) and its sister 
organization, the Asian Pacific American Insti-
tute of Congressional Studies (APAICS), to 
advocate for issues concerning the AAPI com-
munity. It is because of his efforts that the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander commu-
nity has a greater voice in this chamber. My 
prayers are with his family, friends, and the 
AAPI community. We have all lost an icon. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the entire House to 
continue to honor Secretary Mineta’s legacy 
through our commitment to justice and equal-
ity for all.

JUSTIN 
LELAND 
PERRY 
AND 
JASON 
HADFIELD 
FOR RECEIVING THE CARNEGIE 
MEDAL 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Justin Leland Perry and 
Jason Hadfield for being awarded the Car-
negie Medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund Com-
mission for saving a young girl from drowning. 
Their heroic actions cannot be overstated, and 
our community is indebted to their laudable ef-
forts. 
Originally created by industrialist and philan-
thropist Andrew Carnegie, the Carnegie Hero 
Fund Commission was implemented to recog-
nize selfless and heroic acts from citizens 
across the U.S. and Canada. The medal’s in-
spiration dates back to 1904 during the 
Harwick Mine tragedy where 181 lives were 
lost. Two victims of the disaster sacrificed 
themselves to save others which inspired Car-
negie to create the fund. Since then, more 
than 10,000 awardees have been honored, 
with more than $40 million given in grants, 
scholarships, death benefits, and other assist-
ance. There is no doubt that Justin and Jason 
are deserving of this honor. 
On July 25, 2020, in Honor, Michigan, a 
young girl was swimming on a floatie in Lake 
Michigan when suddenly the tether slipped off 
of her mother’s wrist. Instantly, the high winds 
and strong current pulled the floatie away from 
shore eventually tipping the girl over in the 
water. Justin Leland Perry and Jason Hadfield, 
who were with different groups, sprang into 
action using a child’s life ring and kayak to 
help bring the victim to shore. Justin and Ja-
son’s valiant efforts saved a young life and 
prevented significant and tragic hardship for a 
family and community. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Justin Leland Perry and Jason Hadfield for 
being awarded the Carnegie Medal by the 
Carnegie 
Hero 
Fund 
Commission. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such selfless and 
heroic citizens. On behalf of my constituents, 
I wish them all the best in their future endeav-
ors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor University of Hawaii football coach 
Bob ‘‘Wags’’ Wagner on his 75th birthday. 
Coach Bob ‘‘Wags’’ Wagner is a two-time 
Conference Coach of the Year and led the 
University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors to their 
first bowl game in 1989, their first Western

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

May 16, 2022 
Holiday Bowl season in 1992. Coach Wags’ 
record is 58–49–3. 
Bob Wagner was born on May 16, 1947 in 
Newark, Ohio to the late George and Jessie 
Wagner. The youngest of six siblings— 
George, Mary, Harriet, Dolores and Teresa— 
Bob grew up playing neighborhood pickup 
football and following regional collegiate foot-
ball powerhouse, the Ohio State Buckeyes, 
with his family. A two-sport collegiate athlete, 
Bob was a two-time all-conference selection in 
football and two-time all-region selection in la-
crosse. Bob graduated from Wittenberg Uni-
versity in 1969. 
He began his career in coaching at Gallip-
olis High School and River View High School 
in Ohio, before coaching at the collegiate level 
at Muskingum University and at the College of 
Wooster. Always drawn to the Pacific, Coach 
Wags had his first opportunity to coach Divi-
sion I football as an assistant at the University 
of Washington under coach Don James in 
1976. 
In 1977, Coach Wags came to the Univer-
sity of Hawaii as an assistant coach under 
Larry Price, and was promoted to defensive 
coordinator in 1983 under head coach Dick 
Tomey. Coach Wags became head coach of 
the Rainbow Warriors in 1987, and served the 
University of Hawaii football program for al-
most two decades. He was inducted into the 
Newark Athletic Hall of Fame, the Wittenberg 
Athletics Hall of Honor, and the University of 
Hawaii Sports Circle of Honor. 
Coach Wags concluded his career in ath-
letics leadership at Kamehameha Schools— 
and is the author of a 1993 book titled, ‘‘Get-
ting the Edge: Hawaii Football’’ which details 
the history of football in Hawaii and Coach 
Wags’ time as one of the first major college 
head coaches to embrace the spread concept 
of the triple-option philosophy. He currently 
enjoys his retirement on Hawaii Island with his 
wife and University of Hawaii alumna, Gloria. 
I wish Coach Wags a happy birthday, and 
continued health and happiness to he and 
Gloria in the years to come.

COMMUNITY 
SERVICES 
BLOCK 
GRANT MODERNIZATION ACT OF 
2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 13, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5129, the 
bipartisan CSBG Modernization Act, and in 
support of my amendment to the bill. 
I appreciate the chairman for his support of 
my amendment and for bringing this bill to re-
authorize the Community Services Block Grant 
(CSBG), which supports critical efforts to help 
those living in poverty, to the floor. 
The CSBG supports a comprehensive effort 
in our communities to help families find jobs, 
obtain housing and food, and achieve self-suf-
ficiency. 
CSBG funds are to be used for activities 
that have a ‘‘meaningful and potentially signifi-
cant impact’’ on causes of poverty. The law 
broadly defines allowable activities including 
education, help finding employment, removing 
obstacles to self-sufficiency, and maintaining 
adequate House. But the actual use is deter-
mined by local communities through a needs 
assessment. 
This reauthorization reflects a renewed com-
mitment to streamline and revitalize the pro-
gram’s stated purpose: to reduce poverty 
through support for Community Action Agen-
cies that improve economic security of low-in-
come individuals and families and create new 
opportunities in the communities where they 
live. 
There are sixteen CSBG funded Community 
Action Agencies in Wisconsin including the 
Social 
Development 
Commission 
in 
Mil-
waukee. 
One of the challenges low-income individ-
uals and families in Wisconsin and elsewhere 
in our country face every day is food insecu-
rity. In the richest country on this plan, too 
many low-income individuals and families find 
themselves struggling to feed themselves and 
their families each and every day. 
According to Feeding America (as of March 
2021), an estimated 680,330 Wisconsinites 
(11.7 percent or just over 1 in 8), including 1 
in 5 children, experienced food insecurity in 
2020. That includes 147,000 food insecure 
people in Milwaukee County alone. 
Feeding America Wisconsin likewise noted 
that its food banks saw an average sustained 
increase in demand for food assistance of 40– 
55 percent in the first months of the pandemic. 
But I know I don’t need to remind anyone that 
food insecurity has long been a problem in our 
country. 
This problem is only worsening as food 
prices rise while at the same time, federal 
supports that have helped these families keep 
food on the table, such as the American Res-
cue Plan’s child tax credit improvements and 
the USDA’s school meal waivers, are coming 
to an end. 
Vulnerable communities most at risk for 
food insecurity include seniors and the dis-
abled living on fixed incomes, people of color, 
families with children. 
My amendment would strengthen efforts to 
address nutrition and food insecurity through 
the Community Service Block Grant. As noted 
by WISCAP, ‘‘food insecurity is foremost not a 
condition, but a symptom—a particularly pain-
ful and persistent symptom—of our local, 
state, and national failure to fundamentally 
confront and eliminate economic inequality. 
Food insecurity stands at the crossroads of a 
host of causal factors—social, corporate, eco-
nomic, cultural, personal, educational, and 
governmental—with which it is deeply inter-
twined. When households lack sufficient in-
come to meet their basic needs—whether 
housing, 
utilities, 
health 
care, 
education, 
childcare, and transportation—families will first 
prioritize inflexible bills—like rent, electricity, 
heat, gas that cannot be negotiated—thus re-
ducing amount of money in the household 
budget to buy food. Thus, economic insecurity 
‘translates into’ food insecurity.’’ 
As we modernize and improve the CSBG 
for the 21st Century, we must make sure that 
we do not forget the need to help families put 
and keep food on the table. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amend-
ment and the underlying bill.

mired Superintendent of Plano Independent 
School District (Plano ISD) in Texas’ Third 
Congressional District. 
A lifelong lover of education, Ms. Bonser 
earned an undergraduate degree in Business 
Education from the University of Wisconsin- 
Eau Claire, a Master’s degree in Education 
Administration from the University of North 
Texas, and a superintendent’s certification 
from Texas A&M Commerce. 
Ms. Bonser began her thirty-three years of 
service in public education with Plano ISD, 
where she served in a multitude of roles in-
cluding as a teacher, assistant principal, and 
as a principal at Williams High School. Her 
ability to understand and appreciate how var-
ious roles within a school system work in tan-
dem earned her the respect of those around 
her including her colleagues, parents, and stu-
dents. She would later assume the position of 
Chief Academic Officer, Chief Administrative 
Officer, Assistant Superintendent for Student 
and Family Services, and was the first Director 
of Student and Family Services with Rockwall 
Independent School District prior to her home-
coming with Plano ISD. 
Sara Bonser was first appointed to serve as 
the District Superintendent of Plano ISD in 
March 2018 following her impressive service 
as interim Deputy Superintendent. 
Ms. Bonser is highly esteemed within the 
community as evidenced by her involvement 
in various professional and civic organizations 
including the Academy for Transformational 
Leadership, Raise Your Hand Texas Principal 
Leadership Development Program at Harvard 
University, the Executive Board of the Texas 
School Coalition, Vice Chair of the Region 10 
Education Service Center’s Regional Advisory 
Committee, the Texas Association of School 
Administrators Advocacy Committee, the Coa-
lition for Behavioral Healthcare in Collin Coun-
ty, and the Medical City Plano Community Ad-
visory Council to name just a few. 
Additionally, Sara was recognized for her 
steadfast efforts as a recipient of the Principal 
of the Year Award from the College Board 
Southwest Region for Excellence in the Ad-
vanced Placement (AP) Program, and as a 
Semifinalist for the HEB Excellence in Edu-
cation Award Secondary Principal of the Year. 
As a further testament to her respect in the

community, Bonser was named one of Plano 
Magazine’s 2018 Girl Bosses and the 2020 
Business Executive of the Year by the Plano 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Perhaps Ms. Bonser’s most lasting legacy of 
leadership lies in her passion for student suc-
cess and the countless lives she has influ-
enced during her many years in education. 
Now as Sara begins a new season of life, 
enjoying time with her family including her 
husband of 29 years, I ask my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing her for dedicated efforts 
and to wish her blessings in her future en-
deavors.

MOILA SHRINERS OF ST. JOSEPH, 
MISSOURI 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Moila Shrine in 
St. Joseph, Missouri. 2022 is a huge year for 
the Moila Shrine celebrating two big mile-
stones in their history. 2022 will mark both the 
100th anniversary of the first Shriners Hospital 
for Children as well as their 100th anniversary 
of their location in St. Joseph, Missouri, 
The Moila Shrine is a true landmark in St. 
Joseph. Whether it was being remodeled or 
expanded, wars, civil unrest, bust or boom the 
Moila Shrine has stood proudly on Noyes Ave. 
For those in St. Joseph, it has been a meeting 
place of celebration and community for gen-
erations. While it is the Moila Shrine, it’s abso-
lutely something enjoyed by all of St. Joseph. 
The unofficial motto of the Moila Shrine is: 
Regularly experience fun with a purpose. That 
purpose is the support of Shriners Hospitals 
for Children. There are 22 hospitals across 
North America that provide expert orthopedic, 
cleft palate, spinal cord and bum care for chil-
dren under the age of 18 at no cost to their 
families. Over 1,000,000 have been helped to 
lead better and more fulfilling lives in the cen-
tury since the first of these hospitals have 
been founded. Which speaks nothing of the 
valuable research they have undertaken to ad-
vance treatments for children everywhere. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me and the people of the Sixth Congressional 
District in recognizing the Moila Shrine of St. 
Joseph, Missouri upon the centennial of their 
Shrine in St. Joseph and the centennial of 
founding of their first children’s hospital. I am 
proud to represent the 1200 members of the 
Moila Shrine in the United States House of 
Representatives.

IN RECOGNITION OF PRIMROSE 
HILL ADULT & TEEN CHALLENGE 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Primrose Hill Adult & 
Teen Challenge for their years of devotion to 
helping women receive faith-based recovery 
care. Primrose Hill recently received the 
Champion for Drug-Free Missouri Award. 
Primrose Hill is a residential recovery center 
for women and women with young children 
who have drug and alcohol addictions, located 
in Clark, Missouri. They are associated with 
the Adult & Teen Challenge, which is a non- 
profit 
faith-based 
organization 
that 
helps 
women find freedom from addiction. When 
women join the Primrose Hill Adult and Teen 
Challenge as students, they are given an op-
portunity to confront their choices, behavior, 
and any unhealthy views with the love of God 
and the guidance of Biblical principles. By al-
lowing the women to bring their young chil-
dren, Primrose Hill has also provided a space 
for mothers and children to experience mutual 
healing. 
Primrose Hill has proven to be a recovery 
center like no other, serving fifteen women in 
2021 alone. Women from all over the United 
States come to Primrose Hill to experience 
physical, mental, and spiritual healing. They 
contribute to their own recovery by doing ev-
eryday activities such as cleaning the house, 
cooking their meals, or working at one of the 
nearby colleges. These women also attend 
chapel services, Christian growth classes, 
church, and receive Christian mentoring. 
To further forward their cause, Primrose Hill 
started PrimGoods, a bath and body care 
company. The natural products are made by 
the women in the program as another way for 
them to experience recovery. The products in-
clude homemade bar soaps, lip balms, and 
much more. All the proceeds raised from sell-
ing their products are used to supplement the 
cost of running the program. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Primrose 
Hill Adult & Teen Challenge for their hard work 
and dedication, and I thank them for their 
years of selfless devotion to recovery and res-
toration.

RECOGNIZING 
MICHAEL 
A. 
ASCIONE 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD 
AND HONORING HIS LIFE AND 
SERVICE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Michael A. Ascione, who 
passed away unexpectedly in 2020, for his 
lifetime of service and for receiving the Distin-
guished Service Award from Traverse Con-
nect. Through his extreme dedication to the 
public good, Michael became an indispensable 
part of the State of Michigan. 
A longtime resident of Northern Michigan 
and Grand Traverse County, Michael Ascione 
was a graduate of Kalkaska High School and 
attended 
Northwestern 
Michigan 
College. 
Early in his career, Michael joined Northern A– 
1—an industrial environmental services and 
waste disposal company founded by his fa-
ther, Edward Ascione, Sr. Michael and his 
brother, Edward, Jr., went on to found Amer-
ican Waste, an affiliate to Northern A–1 he 
helped run for nearly 20 years. 
Along with running his family businesses, 
Michael was heavily involved in his community 
and served in many local groups including 
Traverse Connect, Kalkaska Area Chamber of 
Commerce, Kalkaska Downtown Development 
Authority, Northern Michigan DeColores Min-
istries, Kalkaska Area Interfaith Resources, 
The Father Fred Foundation, Traverse Bay 
Economic Development Corporation, and the 
Northwestern Michigan College Foundation. 
He also served in various committee positions 
with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northern 
Michigan and received the ‘‘Big Defender’’ 
award in 2019 with his wife, Jeanne. Since 
1929, the Distinguished Service Award has 
been given to leaders who have had a tre-
mendously positive impact on the Traverse 
City area. Through his decades of service to 
his community, Michael has shown himself to 
be more than deserving of this honor. 
Michael passed away unexpectedly in No-
vember 2020. His steadfast care and friendly 
nature towards all members of his community 
will surely leave a lasting mark on those who 
had the opportunity to know him. He is missed 
dearly by his family and friends, and his leg-
acy will undoubtedly live on for generations to 
come. Michael’s tireless dedication to public 
service 
touched 
the 
lives 
of 
countless 
Michiganders, and the impact of his work can-
not be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life and service of Michael 
Ascione. His legacy will forever live on in his 
family and in the many lives he bettered 
through his service.

CONGRATULATING THE FIELD MU-
SEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY ON 
ITS 
NEW 
EXHIBITION—NATIVE 
TRUTHS: OUR VOICES, OUR STO-
RIES 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I am fortunate to represent a District 
with so many wonderful museums and cultural 
organizations that help make Chicago such a 
vibrant city. 
One of these is the world-famous Field Mu-
seum of Natural History, which was founded in 
1893 and whose exhibitions, research, edu-
cation, and conservation programs attract 
more than one million onsite visitors each 
year. 
The Museum’s 1,300,000-square-foot, 1921 
landmark building on Chicago’s lakefront re-
sides on the ancestral homelands of the Three 
Fires Confederacy: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Pota-
watomi. The area was also a site of trade, 
gathering and healing for more than a dozen 
other Native tribes. The state of illinois is cur-
rently home to more than 100,000 tribal mem-
bers. 
I rise today to congratulate the Field Mu-
seum on its groundbreaking new exhibition, 
Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories, which 
replaces and reimagines its former Native 
North America Hall and opens to the public on 
May 20. 
Over four years in the making, Native 
Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories features sto-
ries by Native American people of self-deter-
mination, resilience, continuity, and the future. 
It was conceived through extensive collabora-
tion with more than 100 partners and Tribes, 
including Native American scholars, commu-
nity leaders, artists, and museum profes-
sionals.

the Native American experience both past and 
present. 
Madam Speaker, I invite you and my es-
teemed House colleagues to come to Chicago

HONORING MR. ARNOLD FIELKOW 
AS A 2022 AVODAH AWARD RE-
CIPIENT 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate my constituent Mr. Ar-
nold Fielkow on the occasion of his recogni-
tion as a 2022 Avodah Award recipient, one of 
the highest awards granted to a social justice 
leader in the Jewish Community of New Orle-
ans. 
Arnold Fielkow with his wife, Dr. Susan 
Fielkow, and their three boys, Justin, Michael 
and Steven, moved to New Orleans in 2000 
from Wisconsin when Fielkow took the posi-
tion of executive vice president with the New 
Orleans Saints organization. Fifteen years 
ago, after years of working their way through 
the international adoption process, and after 
Hurricane Katrina washed away their original 
documents, the family adopted half-sisters 
Yana Shira, 9, and Svetlana, 6, from the 
Ukraine. To this very day, Arnie and his family 
are watching the turmoil as it unfolds in 
Ukraine, hoping to find a safe passage for the 
sisters and their children of his adopted 
daughters. 
A leader with a knack for business and an 
expert coalition-builder, Mr. Fielkow worked 
with the NFL’s New Orleans Saints from 2000 
to 2005, In this role, he served as the top sen-
ior management official presiding over all ad-
ministrative and business departments for the 
organization, including community relations 
and youth programs. Fielkow was instrumental 
in enhancing the team’s influence—inter-
nationally, nationally, and locally—throughout 
Louisiana. He was the key negotiator achiev-
ing a landmark 10-year agreement for Saints 
facilities here in the state, putting his entire ca-
reer at risk on such a deal. 
Fielkow also oversaw tremendous growth in 
the Saints’ youth programming, highlighted by 
the organization’s involvement in the NFL’s 
Junior Player Development program, and the 
administration 
of 
summer 
youth 
clinics 
throughout greater New Orleans. Teaming 
with the NFL and the Orleans Parish School 
Board, the Saints were instrumental in return-
ing tackle football to the city’s public middle 
schools. 
Arnie left the Saints Organization for public 
service, 
elected 
to 
the 
position 
of 
Councilmember At Large for the City of New 
Orleans. As a City Councilman, he helped re-
build New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, 
introducing legislation to improve education, 
economic development, public safety and 
youth recreation across the storm-ravaged 
city. Fielkow played a major role in ensuring 
that recreation and athletics remained a sig-
nificant focus for the youth of the city. 
Upon stepping down from the City Council 
in a second term, he served as the President 
and CEO of the National Basketball Retired 
Players Association (NBRPA), the official as-
sociation for all former NBA, ABA, WNBA and 
Harlem Globetrotter players. Under his tenure, 
the association achieved an all-time high in 
membership, built strong partnerships with 
other organizations, and developed a full 
menu of member programs and new youth- 
based national community service initiatives. 
This new community mission directly led to 
the creation of the NBRPA’s touring youth 
basketball program and life skills program, 
which served thousands of at-risk youth in 
partnership with the National Police Athletic/ 
Activities League and the National Urban 
League. 
I am convinced Arnie never sleeps as he 
develops new ways to assist those in need. 
His latest innovative program was jointly cre-
ated by the Arnie D. Fielkow Family and the 
Edgar ‘‘Dooky’’ Jr. & Leah Chase Family 
Foundation. Both names are well-known 
among New Orleanians, and their collabora-
tion combines the primary passions of each 
family as seen through their years of philan-
thropic service. This program is a definitive 
nod to Arnie Fielkow’s nearly 30-year profes-
sional career of sports, Judaism, and relation-
ship-building among the diverse subsets of our 
city’s diverse communities. The Fielkow-Chase 
Youth Education Initiative is designed to build 
impactful relationships between multicultural 
and multifaith communities in Greater New Or-
leans. Through practical learning and career 
skills building, this program services high 
school students interested in pursuing profes-
sions within the sports industry, while at the 
same time allowing the participating teens to 
learn about one another’s history, traditions, 
and culture. This exciting initiative launched in 
October 2021. 
Rooted in community and public service, Mr. 
Fielkow’s current work as CEO of the Jewish 
Federation of New Orleans is his latest step in 
a lifelong pattern of bringing people together 
and doing what is best for the people. 
Throughout his stellar career, Mr. Fielkow 
has succeeded in combining his commitment 
to public service with his love of sports, and 
always sought to improve access, facilities 
and programming for our children and young 
people. 
I could go on about the experience, honors, 
and exemplary leadership that this honoree 
has displayed, but I want to share something 
that Mr. Fielkow and I are working on together 
currently. 
Through the congressional Appropriations 
Community Project Funding Projects, I was 
able to secure $3 million dollars for the 9th 
Ward Stadium Project, whose sole mission is 
to build a high-quality, multi-use sports recre-
ation stadium for students, schools, and fami-
lies in New Orleans’ 9th Ward. Of course, who 
other than Mr. Arnie Fielkow is Chair of this 
organization and is leading the on-the-ground 
effort to build this facility in a community that 
has far too long had to travel to other neigh-
borhoods and other schools to use their sports 
facilities. This stadium will change many lives 
for the better in New Orleans’ 9th Ward. 
The 9th Ward Stadium effort is just the lat-
est example of Mr. Fielkow’s love for New Or-
leans—and sports—in action, and I am so 
grateful to have secured this funding for this 
fantastic project. 
Congratulations to Mr. Arnie Fielkow on this 
award. His wife, children, as well as the entire 
Greater New Orleans Community, are so 
proud and grateful to have him in our lives.

JAN LYONS 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jan Lyons, a great Kansan and this 
year’s winner of the 2022 Jay B. Dillingham 
Award for Agricultural Leadership and Excel-
lence. 
Jan is certainly a deserving recipient of such 
an honor. As a young person, she got started 
raising her own angus cattle with a few of her 
dad’s cows. In the 1970s, Jan and her hus-
band Frank Lyons started the Lyons Ranch 
Angus cowherd south of Manhattan, Kansas, 
with some of the females originating from her 
father’s herd. Today, Lyons Ranch consists of 
Jan and Frank and with their daughter Amy 
and her husband Karl, along with their sons 
with their wives. Jan’s daughter Debbie also 
manages a cattle operation with her husband. 
Jan is the matriarch of a true family operation, 
which is why I’m delighted to honor her here 
today. 
Jan was the first woman president of the 
Kansas Angus Association. She was also the 
president of the Kansas Livestock Association 
and the president of the National Cattlemen’s 
Beef Association. With all this on her plate, 
Jan has still found time to serve as a 4–H 
leader in Riley County where she teaches 
young people about the importance of agri-
culture. 
Jan has received a great deal of praise for 
being a trailblazing woman in agriculture. In 
response to this praise, Jan once said, 
‘‘Women have always been in agriculture— 
they 
just 
haven’t 
always 
been 
the 
spokespeople. I would like to think that I am 
just a good rancher and good leader—not a 
good woman rancher.’’ Well Jan, you are a 
great rancher and an outstanding leader. 
I congratulate Jan on her well-deserved 
award, and thank her for all her hard work on 
behalf of Kansas agriculture.

May 16, 2022 
During Operation Iraqi Freedom, I had the 
honor to command an expeditionary squadron 
that was based in Qatar. This enabled me to 
work closely with our Qatari allies, who 
worked closely with the American military. I 
gained great respect for their dedication to our 
shared missions. I was also able to establish 
friendships with a number of Qatari military 
leaders; relations that have been renewed 
every time I have visited Qatar in subsequent 
years. 
America’s relationship with Qatar was not 
originally based upon military or strategic prin-
ciples. In fact, when the United States first es-
tablished diplomatic relations with Qatar 1971, 
the new Persian Gulf nation was hardly a mili-
tary power. 
In 1916, Qatar became a British protec-
torate, which meant that Britain agreed to de-
fend Qatar from all aggression by sea and 
support in case of a land attack. When Qatar 
declared its independence in September 1971, 
no one could have predicted that this small 
Persian Gulf nation would develop into an 
economic and strategic powerhouse. 
It is a tribute to leaders and its citizens that 
Qatar has accomplished so much in so many 
different areas. Much of the credit goes to the 
royal family and other political leaders who al-
located spending on social programs, includ-
ing housing, health, education, and pensions. 
Over time this enabled the relatively small 
population of Qatar to become better edu-
cated, healthier and committed to the welfare 
of the nation. 
Qatar’s leaders were well aware of the na-
tion’s precarious position as a major energy 
supplier, but without the means to defend itself 
and its resources. Thus, the nation began to 
build up its defense capabilities. 
In 1991, Qatar played a significant role in 
the Gulf War, particularly during the Battle of 
Khafji in which Qatari tanks rolled through the 
streets of the town and engaged Iraqi troops. 
In addition, Qatar allowed coalition troops from 
Canada to use the country as an airbase to 
launch aircraft from Qatar. Qatar also per-
mitted air forces from the United States and 
France to operate in its territories. 
In the aftermath of this, both nations agreed 
upon the need for a Defense Cooperation 
Agreement. This pact, which has subsequently 
been expanded, has served as the basis for 
military collaboration. In 1996, Qatar built Al 
Udeid Air Base at the cost of more than $1 bil-
lion. 
Significantly, military cooperation between 
the United States and Qatar continued to ex-
pand. In 2003, Qatar served as the U.S. Cen-
tral Command headquarters and one of the 
main launching sites of the invasion of Iraq. 
As mentioned, I was able to participate in this 
operation. 
Al Udeid is now home to the largest U.S. 
military base in the Middle East. In a region 
sensitive about the presence of U.S. military 
forces, it is notable that Qatar is not only al-
lowing expansion of Al Udeid, but also funding 
it and managing the construction. In fact, the 
Qatari government has provided over $8 bil-
lion in funding for al-Udeid Air Base since 
2003. After renovations and expansions, Al 
Udeid can accommodate up to 120 aircraft 
and 10,000 troops. The Al Udeid Air Base has 
the longest runway in the Gulf region, about 
5000 meters or 15,000 feet. 
President Joe Biden met in Washington with 
the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad 
Al Thani, on January 31, 2022. This meeting 
was the first that President Biden had with a 
regional leader since he became president. It 
was a clear signal that Washington views 
Doha as an important asset in the region. This 
was underscored when the President told the 
Emir that the United States would nominate 
Qatar as a ‘‘Major Non-NATO Ally’’ (MNNA). 
This MNNA status recognizes the bilateral 
security cooperation between the United 
States and Qatar has matured to the level be-
yond the already deep defense partnership 
that had developed and nourished over the 
course of decades. The MNNA status recog-
nizes Qatar’s growing responsibility as a 
strong and enduring U.S. partner in countering 
violent extremism, combating terrorism, and 
deterring external aggressors. It also rein-
forces U.S. military access to Qatari military 
facilities, allows prepositioning of U.S. armor 
and other military materiel, and supports U.S. 
training of Qatar’s military forces. 
American officials have come to realize the 
potential Qatar offered to American interests in 
the region, both politically as well as militarily. 
Soon after the Gulf War, the emir announced 
his intention for Qatar to move more toward 
democracy and permitted more liberal press 
and municipal elections as a precursor to ex-
pected parliamentary elections. A new con-
stitution was approved via public referendum 
in April 2003 and came into effect in June 
2005. Economic, social, and democratic re-
forms occurred in the proceeding years. 
In 2003, a woman was appointed to the 
cabinet as minister of education. In October 
2021, Qataris voted in the Gulf Arab state’s 
first legislative elections for two-thirds of the 
advisory Shura Council, and turnout was over 
63 percent. There were women candidates 
and women have been appointed to seats in 
the Council. 
Qatar has also been an invaluable asset on 
a number of diplomatic fronts. Qatar quietly 
assisted in ending the Israel-Hamas war in 
May 2021 and continues to be helpful in seek-
ing to improve Israeli relations with Palestin-
ians. Qatar is also working to reduce tensions 
between the United States and Iran. 
Without a doubt, Qatar’s most significant 
diplomatic and humanitarian efforts were in 
the evacuation of more than 100,000 people 
from Afghanistan after the American with-
drawal. Qatar was uniquely positioned be-
cause of its ability to speak to various parties 
on the ground and its willingness to escort 
people through Taliban-controlled Kabul. 
Qataris helped to vet individuals seeking to 
leave the country and organized aspects of 
their departure. Many of the flights that en-
abled people to flee were on Qatari airlines. In 
addition, a large percentage of the new refu-
gees were brought to Qatar, which arranged 
housing and other shelter for them as well as 
food, medicine and other provisions. At one 
point, the Qatari military was proving over 
50,000 meals per day to the newly arrived ref-
ugees. There are still thousands of Afghan ref-
ugees in Qatar, where they continue to re-
ceive much needed care and assistance. 
On September 7, 2021, only weeks after the 
American withdrawal from Afghanistan, De-
fense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken flew to Doha to 
acknowledge the transit and care of the evac-
uees from Afghanistan and to thank Qatar for 
its vital assistance. 
Secretary Blinken complimented Qatar’s ef-
forts in the evacuation: ‘‘. . . you’ve facilitated 
the safe transit of more than 55,000 people. 
That’s nearly half of those who were evacu-
ated in the entire evacuation from Kabul. 
These are massive numbers. And as I’ve said 
a number of times, we spend a lot of time 
back in Washington talking about numbers: 
the total number of evacuees, American citi-
zens, and so forth. But you know better than 
anyone that behind each of these numbers is 
a real person, is a mother, a father, a sister, 
a brother, a son, a daughter.’’ 
Qatar’s role did not end with the evacuation. 
Since the United States does not recognize 
the Taliban dominated government in Afghani-
stan, all American interests in Afghanistan are 
now being handled by the Qatari Embassy 
and other offices in Kabul. 
While the military and diplomatic coopera-
tion that has developed over the years is im-
pressive and vital to the security interests of 
both nations, there are so many other areas in 
which the relations between our two nations 
have flourished over the course of the past 
fifty years. 
The United States and Qatar have extensive 
economic ties. As Qatar’s largest foreign direct 
investor and its single largest source of im-
ports, the United States has developed a ro-
bust trade relationship with Qatar, with over 
120 U.S. companies operating in country. U.S. 
exports to Qatar increased by 47.7 percent 
from 2018 to 2019, totaling $6.5 billion in 
2019. 
The United States is a leading equipment 
supplier and partner for Qatar’s oil and gas in-
dustry, and U.S. companies have played a 
significant role in the development of the oil 
and gas sector. In addition to energy, U.S. 
companies also export to Qatar’s defense, 
aviation, ICT, healthcare, food, and engineer-
ing/construction sectors. 
U.S. imports from Qatar include liquefied 
natural gas, aluminum, fertilizers, and sulfur. 
The United States and Qatar signed a trade 
and investment framework agreement and 
participate in annual bilateral Strategic Dia-
logues. 
Qatar announced plans to invest $45 billion 
in the United States, which will result in an ad-
ditional 50,000 American jobs. 
But Qatar’s financial dealings in the United 
States go well beyond investments and the 
import-export of goods and services. Qatar is 
extremely philanthropic. Qatar donated $100 
million in aid to New Orleans after Hurricane 
Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in August 
2005. After Hurricane Harvey hit the state of 
Texas from August to September 2017, 
Qatar’s donated $30 million in aid to help re-
build Texas. Qatar and Qatari foundations 
have also made significant donations to wor-
thy causes as autism, both research and care 
for individuals. 
Qatar provides education for all of its citi-
zens, and a majority of its college graduates 
are now women. 
Major education ties have been developed 
over the course of the fifty-year relationship. 
Annually, hundreds of Qatari students study in 
the United States. In addition, six U.S. univer-
sities have branch campuses in Qatar’s Edu-
cation City complex. There are Virginia Com-
monwealth University School of the Arts in 
Qatar (VCUQ), Weill Cornell Medical College 
in Qatar (WCMC–Q), Texas A&M University at 
Qatar (TAMUQ), Carnegie Mellon University in 
Qatar 
(CMU–Q), 
Georgetown 
University 
School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS– 
Qatar), and Northwestern University.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E509 
May 16, 2022 
In sum, over the course of the fifty-year re-
lationship, the United States and Qatar have 
developed military and strategic ties, cooper-
ated on major diplomatic initiatives, enlarged 
financial and economic relations, supported 
worthy causes and educational advancement 
for students in both countries. 
Significantly, although our two nations lo-
cated in different regions of the world, with dif-
ferent histories and cultures, they have been 
able to forge an enduring friendship based on 
many shared values. This will set the stage for 
the next fifty years and beyond.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
BILL HAGLER 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the life of Bill Hagler. 
Bill Hagler passed away on April 29, 2022, 
at the age of 94 after living a full life in Annis-
ton, Alabama. Bill is best known for his time 
on the former Anniston WHMA Channel 40 tel-
evision station as a meteorologist, host of the 
show ‘‘By The Way’’ and host of ‘‘Dialing for 
Dollars.’’ Prior to his time on air, he served as 
General 
Manager 
for 
WAVU/WZSB 
in 
Albertville from 1953 to 1969. He served in the 
United States Air Force in the late 1940s and 
early 1950s. 
Bill was a very active part of his community 
and church. He was a member of the Lions 
Club of Albertville, the Anniston Kiwanis Club 
and was elected as Governor for Kiwanis in 
Alabama. He was a long-time member of An-
niston First United Methodist Church. 
Bill was married to Ellie and blessed with 
three sons, four grandchildren and five great- 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Bill’s life of service and dedication to my 
hometown. He will be greatly missed.

HONORING FRISCO CITY MANAGER 
GEORGE PUREFOY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 16, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
today to recognize Mr. George Purefoy, the 
longtime City Manager for the City of Frisco, 
for his thirty-four years of dedicated public 
service in cultivating one of the fastest grow-
ing cities in our nation. 
Mr. Purefoy earned his Bachelor of Arts 
from the University of Texas at Arlington and 
his Masters Degree in Public Administration 
from East Texas State University. Prior to be-
ginning his storied career with the City of Fris-
co, he would work as a city police officer and 
serve in various municipalities including those 
of Boerne, Taylor Lake Village and Columbus. 
Mr. Purefoy began his tenure as the first 
and only City Manager of Frisco on November 
1, 1987. At that time, Frisco was a town of 
only 5,000 residents, but Purefoy maintained a 
unique vision of what the City could grow into 
with the right leadership. Upon his arrival he 
went to work behind the scenes on remedying 
a multitude of municipal issues that had lim-
ited the City’s ability to thrive while striving to 
create the foundation for its modem day suc-
cesses. Due to his ability to serve as a conduit 
between multiple levels of government, edu-
cational, and private entities, the City has 
been credited with a variety of successful col-
laborative efforts leading to the development 
of multiple corporate, sports and civic attrac-
tions. 
It is indisputable that Mr. Purefoy has 
served as a cornerstone in establishing Frisco 
as one of the most sought after cities in which 
to live, work, and raise a child. His proudest 
professional achievements include helping 
Frisco become a member city in the North 
Texas Municipal Water District and serving as 
a lead architect in a multitude of public-private 
partnerships, 
including 
Toyota 
Stadium, 
Comerica Center, The STAR, and PGA Frisco 
to name a few. Widely admired as a gentle- 
spoken man of faith and a humble servant 
leader, over the past several decades he has 
shepherded Frisco with steadfast commitment 
and intentionality to sustainable growth. 
Now as George begins an exciting new 
chapter in his life filled with plans for travel 
with his wife, Debra, I ask my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in saluting him for his many efforts to 
build what is arguably one of the best cities in 
America and wish him well as he undertakes 
a richly deserved retirement.
