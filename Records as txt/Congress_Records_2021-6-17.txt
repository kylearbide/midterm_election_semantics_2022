PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our God, speak into our lives 
as You have spoken throughout time. 
On the day of historic jubilee, speak 
good news to the poor that they would 
have occasion to celebrate emanci-
pation from chains that yet bind them. 
Proclaim liberty to those still held 
captive by injustice. Give sight to 
those blind to Your merciful love. Free 
all who are oppressed and break every 
yoke of prejudice and hatred. 
Then call upon us to be the bearers of 
these truths in both word and deed. 
Cast our eyes on those around us that 
we would not see slave or free, but 
brothers and sisters, children of Your 
creation. 
That each person who calls the 
United States home be allowed to de-
light in the freedoms afforded them by 
its democracy. 
That liberty and justice would be 
woven inextricably into the fabric of 
our Nation and defended on behalf of 
all her people. 
And that henceforward, all may be 
freed from hate and oppression to enjoy 
Your perfect design for this Republic. 
We pray this, having each been made 
free in Your name. 
Amen.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
HOUSTON’S MEXICAN CONSULATE 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in celebration of 100 
years of the Mexican Consulate’s pres-
ence in Houston. This is huge for the 
diplomatic relationship between two 
neighbors. The consulate was first es-
tablished in 1920, and today it is the 
largest diplomatic mission in the city, 
providing services to tens of thousands 
of people a year. It is proof of the need 
to strengthen, now more than ever, our 
diplomatic ties and tackle our shared 
opportunities and challenges. 
Congratulations, 
Consul 
General 
Alicia Kerber, the first woman to head 
the consulate’s office in Houston. A 
good neighbor, we have worked to-
gether on food drives, COVID testing 
and vaccines, trade, and immigration 
rights. 
Tomorrow, June 18, the consulate 
will be opening its new headquarters. 
Congratulations to the Mexican diplo-
matic mission in Houston. May we con-
tinue to work together the next 100 
years. 
Congratulations. Felicidades.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF BARBARA MORRIS STAFFORD 
(Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in great sadness. Last night, 
at 6:16, my friend, a community leader 
and a member of my district staff, 
passed away, Barbara Morris Stafford. 
Barbara was born in 1953, and was 
part of a political family. Her father, 
Howard Morris, was chairman of the 
Giles County Board of Supervisors. Her 
husband was a 10-term member of the 
Virginia House of Delegates, and when 
he died young, she took over his seat. 
Now a single mother to Chris, Eliza-
beth, and Mary, she served her commu-
nity for many years as a member of the 
Virginia House of Delegates; mayor of 
her hometown of Pearisburg, Virginia; 
director of the chamber of commerce; 
and then, for over 10 years and until 
last night, as a constituent services 
representative in my district office. 
Barbara was a great leader and she 
will be sorely missed by the commu-
nity she loved and the community that 
loved her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2898 
June 17, 2021 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, 
behind me is a sign that has decorated 
the office doors of my Republican col-
leagues for the past few months. I 
agree with the sentiment and I thank 
the Capitol Police Officers for their he-
roic defense on January 6, and every 
day that they protect the seat of this 
Nation’s government. 
My problem is that 175 of my Repub-
lican colleagues, many who still have 
this sign on their doors, voted against 
an independent bipartisan commission 
to investigate the causes of the Janu-
ary 6 insurrection. 
Capitol Police Officers suffered de-
bilitating physical and mental trauma, 
and two lost their lives because of the 
events of that day. Unless we under-
stand how this act of terror was accom-
plished and hold those who are respon-
sible accountable for their actions, it 
could happen again. 
So why did so many Republicans vote 
against the commission? 
Because they are afraid of what could 
be found. They are afraid that it could 
affect their future elections. 
This is hypocrisy at its ugliest. While 
Republicans in Congress pay lip service 
to the Capitol Police and their her-
oism, they are too cowardly to back a 
commission that would shed light on 
the terrorist attack that put the brave 
women’s and men’s lives in danger on 
that terrible day. 
f 
VETERANS DESERVE TIMELY 
SERVICE 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
KELLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America’s veterans have served our Na-
tion honorably, and they deserve time-
ly access to the benefits they have 
earned through their service. 
The National Personnel Records Cen-
ter was forced to scale down its oper-
ations due to the COVID–19 pandemic 
and is currently staffed at 25 percent 
capacity, well below the staffing level 
needed to process the estimated 5,000 
records requests it receives on an aver-
age day. These service records are re-
quired for veterans to access medical 
benefits; adjudicate disability claims; 
and request a commendation, award, or 
regalia, such as a Purple Heart or cam-
paign service medal. 
To date, there is a backlog of half a 
million veterans’ requests at the NPRC 
and, in some cases, veterans have wait-
ed for over a year for documentation. 
That is unacceptable. 
That is why I introduced the Records 
Act, which would compel the NPRC to 
fully reopen, address the backlog, and 
develop a plan to prevent this from 
ever happening again. 
These men and women were willing 
to lay down their lives in service to our 
Nation, and we need to continue work-
ing to ensure our veterans get the level 
of responsiveness from their govern-
ment that they deserve. 
DISCLOSE WORKPLACE 
HARASSMENT 
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor an 
amendment to H.R. 1187, a bill that 
would increase transparency of pub-
licly traded companies to disclose 
workplace harassment cases, and I am 
pleased to see this amendment passed 
in the House yesterday. 
Workplace harassment is far too 
common, and the shareholders and cus-
tomers of a company should know 
whether 
that 
company 
fosters 
a 
healthy work culture and that it al-
lows its workers to thrive. 
Up to six in seven women in the 
workplace report having experienced 
sexual harassment. Seven of 10 people 
of color report experiencing some form 
of verbal, racial, or ethnic harassment, 
and those who speak out usually face 
retaliation. This amendment would 
bring to light these forms of mistreat-
ment and incentivize companies to pre-
vent harassment in the workplace. 
I thank Ms. FRANKEL for her leader-
ship on H.R. 1187, and I encourage my 
colleagues to support this workplace 
improvement bill, as well as improving 
the quality of life.

HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE 
MOTHER 
EMANUEL 
AFRICAN 
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
SHOOTING 
(Ms. MACE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, June 17, 
2015, was one of the darkest days in 
Charleston, South Carolina, history. 
Six years ago today, nine church mem-
bers were gunned down by a white su-
premacist at Mother Emanuel African 
Methodist Episcopal Church. 
Today I rise to honor the lives of 
those lost that day. South Carolina’s 
African-American community showed 
enormous restraint and an outpouring 
of love during this time, even to the ir-
redeemable; and today we stand to-
gether, wrapped in the pride of Charles-
ton Strong. 
So today I would like to recognize 
Reverend and State Senator Clementa 
Pinckney, 
Cynthia 
Hurd, 
Reverend 
Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Tywanza 
Sanders, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, 
Depayne Middleton Doctor, the Rev-
erend 
Daniel 
Simmons, 
and 
Myra 
Thompson. 
You will always be remembered, and 
may you rest in peace.

CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR RACIAL 
JUSTICE 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with great excitement and joy in my 
heart that today Juneteenth will be-
come a national holiday. 
156 years after the end of slavery in 
this country, we will now, on an annual 
basis, reflect collectively and, hope-
fully, begin the process of truth and 
collective healing as a nation. 
But I ask us that we must not stop 
here. We must continue to go forward 
to fight for racial justice because in 
many parts of our country it still ex-
ists in the form of housing discrimina-
tion and segregation, lack of access to 
healthcare, and wealth inequality. 
It is so humbling to stand here as a 
Black man in America and take an-
other step toward feeling whole in this 
country. But we must—we have to 
come together across party lines to do 
much more. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF FOSTER 
FRIESS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, it is 
my privilege today to rise to honor the 
life of Foster Friess, an American pa-
triot who was a warrior for conserv-
ative and Christian values. 
Foster truly lived the American 
Dream. He started his own business 
that led to incredible success. But Fos-
ter leaves behind a legacy that is far 
greater than success, as his generosity 
impacted the lives of countless people. 
His favorite Bible verse from Gala-
tians: ‘‘Carry each other’s burdens, and 
in this way you will fulfill the law of 
Christ.’’ 
To Foster and his wife, Lynnette, 
that verse was more than words; it was 
put into action daily. They were pas-
sionate about charitable giving and al-
ways looking for ways to lend their 
support to people in need. 
He will be missed by many, and my 
prayers are especially with his wife, 
Lynnette, their 4 children and 15 
grandchildren. 
Foster’s life glorified God, and his 
legacy will live on far beyond his years. 
We must all learn from his example.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID 
SAUSSY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor former Chatham County Com-
missioner David Saussy of Savannah, 
Georgia, who passed away on May 19 at 
the age of 86. 
Born the youngest of five children, 
David moved to Savannah in 1964, and 
lived the next 57 years in Ardsley Park.

All who knew David remember his 
Savannah smile and his proud expres-
sions whenever he talked about Savan-
nah’s accomplishments. David’s count-
less friends and family members con-
sider him one of the most generous 
people they knew. 
He was on the boards of the Chat-
ham-Savannah 
Authority 
for 
the 
Homeless and the Coastal Center for 
Development Services, was a founding 
member of the St. David’s Society of 
Savannah, and served two terms as a 
Republican County Commissioner. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact he had on the Savannah commu-
nity, and I know his legacy will re-
main. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

REPEALING THE AUTHORIZATION 
FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE 
AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 
2002 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 473, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 256) to repeal the Author-
ization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 473, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 256 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR 
USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST 
IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2002. 
The Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public 
Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby re-
pealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
the ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs or their 
respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) and the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 256. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 256. Let me start off by 
thanking my very good friend and part-
ner, BARBARA LEE, the author of this 
bill. I am proud to stand with her in 
her unyielding quest to repeal the 2002 
AUMF, and I congratulate her early on 
for working so hard for over 20 years to 
get this done. 
Nineteen years ago, as a junior Mem-
ber of Congress, I faced one of the most 
consequential decisions of my career as 
an elected official with the United 
States Congress. The drumbeats of war 
were reverberating throughout Capitol 
Hill as the Bush administration pre-
pared to invade Iraq. After carefully 
considering all the evidence before us, 
including unanswered questions about 
post-Saddam Iraq, I cast my vote 
against 
authorizing 
military 
force 
against the Hussein regime. 
But our vote this morning to repeal 
the 2002 AUMF is not about reliti-
gating our past. Rather, repealing this 
outdated authorization is about plan-
ning strategically for our future. It is 
about Congress reclaiming its constitu-
tional obligation to weigh in on mat-
ters of war and peace. 
On substance, the case for repealing 
the 2002 AUMF is unassailable. The 2002 
AUMF would have no effect on any on-
going military operations in Iraq. The 
United States is not relying on the 2002 
AUMF as the sole authority for any 
military operations. It has been used as 
an additional legal justification for 
strikes by Presidents from both parties 
but not as the sole authority for any 
strikes over the last decade. The Biden 
administration, in an unprecedented 
move, has announced support for the 
legislation we are moving today. 
Repeal is crucial because the execu-
tive branch has a history of stretching 
the 2002 AUMF’s legal authority. It has 
already been used as justification for 
military actions against entities that 
had nothing to do with Saddam Hus-
sein’s Ba’athist dictatorship, simply 
because such entities were operating in 
Iraq. 
Given all of the countries active near 
Iraq today, including Turkey and Rus-
sia, the 2002 AUMF is vulnerable to 
being abused. 
I have heard from my friend, the 
ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, as well 
as other Members opposed to this legis-
lation who expressed two concerns: one 
on the process, about the need for fur-
ther briefings and conversations, and 
another on substance, about Iran- 
backed groups in Iraq. 
On procedure, we should dispel our-
selves of the fiction that this is a new 
issue. Congress has been debating what 
to do in a post-Saddam Iraq for 18 
years, and our status of forces agree-
ment expired in 2011. This has been a 
frontline issue for nearly two decades, 
and the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee moved this bill through regular 
order. 
Regarding the concern about Iran- 
backed groups, let me once again reit-
erate that the 2002 AUMF was about re-
moving the Hussein regime in Iraq. It 
had absolutely nothing to do with Iran. 
A decade and a half before the 2002 
AUMF was passed, Iran and Iraq were 
fighting each other in a vicious war 
that lasted almost a decade. 
If the President needs to strike these 
groups to defend our Nation, our diplo-
matic personnel, or our Armed Forces, 
he can do so under Article II of the 
Constitution. If any Armed Forces per-
sonnel on the ground need to defend 
themselves, they have the inherent 
right under unit self-defense principles. 
Today, Congress has a historic oppor-
tunity to repeal this outdated author-
ization and reassert its proper author-
ity over the solemn matters of war and 
peace. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
good friend, Chairman MEEKS. We work 
well together. When we disagree, we do 
it civilly, and I think that is the way 
this body should operate. But I do dis-
agree on this one. 
I have said many times before that 
war should not be on autopilot. I do 
think this is an outdated AUMF, and I 
do believe that Congress needs to re-
claim its war powers under Article I of 
the Constitution. 
I also share the desire to repeal the 
2002 AUMF, as well as the 2001 AUMF, 
but that must be part of a serious proc-
ess to provide clear, updated authori-
ties against the terrorists who still 
plot to kill Americans at home and 
abroad. I still hope to work toward 
that end with my respected friend, 
Chairman MEEKS, but a repeal and re-
placement should be simultaneous. 
It is confusing to me that we are 
jamming through a standalone repeal 
without basic due diligence; without 
consulting the State Department, the 
Defense Department, or the intel-
ligence community; without consulting 
the Government of Iraq and our coali-
tion partners and allies. 
In the 3 months since I made that 
complaint at our markup, the majority 
still has not scheduled a single brief-
ing. This, in my judgment, is not a se-
rious legislative process for the most 
serious issues that we face, and that is 
war and peace. 
This feels like yet another political 
effort to undo one of President Trump’s 
boldest 
counterterrorism 
successes: 
using the 2002 AUMF to remove Qasem 
Soleimani from the battlefield. 
Soleimani was Iran’s mastermind of 
terror for decades. He was responsible 
for the death of more than 600 Ameri-
cans and wounded thousands more. He 
orchestrated the attack on our Bagh-
dad Embassy. He plotted to assassinate 
the Saudi Ambassador on American 
soil here in D.C. He oversaw Iran’s sup-
port for Assad, who killed hundreds of 
thousands in Syria. In short, America 
and the world are much safer with 
Qasem Soleimani gone. 
While the 2002 AUMF was largely 
about Saddam Hussein, it also clearly

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2900 
June 17, 2021 
addressed the terrorist threats in and 
emanating from Iraq. All prior admin-
istrations, Republican and Democrat, 
have used it for that purpose. 
Today, the biggest threat in Iraq is 
not Saddam Hussein. We can all recog-
nize that. But it is the Iran-sponsored 
terrorist groups attacking our dip-
lomats, our soldiers, our embassy, and 
our citizens. They cannot be targeted 
using the 2001 AUMF because they are 
not associated with the forces of al- 
Qaida, the Taliban, or ISIS, but they 
can be targeted using the 2002 AUMF, 
as the prior administration did to take 
out Soleimani, consistent with long-
standing practice. 
Last year, the Trump administration 
‘‘strongly opposed’’ repeal, saying it 
would ‘‘terminate a critical legal au-
thority’’ and undermine our defense 
‘‘against ongoing threats from Iran and 
Iranian-sponsored proxies.’’ 
The Biden administration now claims 
that it does not need the 2002 AUMF for 
current operations because it has Arti-
cle II authority to use force without 
congressional authorization. 
Is that what we are going to do now, 
is yield to the President’s Article II au-
thority without any congressional au-
thorization? 
Madam Speaker, that is precisely 
what this repeal does. It takes our au-
thority, 
our 
Article 
I 
authorities, 
away. We are repealing our Article I 
authority and yielding it to the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Telling the President to rely solely 
on Article II, in my judgment, is a big 
step backward from the war powers re-
form and reasserting Congress’ Article 
I powers. 
It is also inconsistent with the War 
Powers Resolution. That law says that 
the President’s Article II powers are 
limited to responding to an attack on 
the territory or Armed Forces of the 
United States. It does not cover Amer-
ican civilians in a foreign country, 
such as our contractors, our diplomats, 
and our embassy, who are under at-
tack, as I speak, in Iraq. 
We should not encourage any Presi-
dent to go it alone without Article I 
congressional authorization. 
Finally, today’s vote is not hap-
pening in a vacuum. This rushed, 
standalone repeal, without any con-
sultation with the Department of De-
fense, the Secretary of State, or the in-
telligence community, as Mr. MAST has 
consistently talked about, sends a dan-
gerous message of disengagement that 
could destabilize Iraq, embolden Iran, 
which it will, and strengthen al-Qaida 
and ISIS in the region. 
We would avoid such dangers by tak-
ing up a repeal and a replacement si-
multaneously. I think both sides of the 
aisle agree, we need to update this 
AUMF, and we need to reform it to the 
modern-day threats in the region. Sad-
dam Hussein is no longer the threat. 
Real AUMF reform requires Congress 
and the administration to work to-
gether. The chairman has committed 
to doing this, and I appreciate and 
trust him. We work well together, but 
we have to do this, to work together 
with the administration to replace this 
aging AUMF with updated authorities 
needed to keep Americans safe from to-
day’s terrorist threats, an updated 
AUMF that reflects the modern-day 
threats in the region. 
Again, I look forward to working to-
gether with Chairman MEEKS and our 
colleagues on this if we are going to be 
serious about war powers reform. But 
this bill is not it. This bill is not re-
sponsible. We are not doing this the 
right way. If we are going to repeal it, 
let’s update the AUMF to modern-day 
needs and reform it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

PELOSI, and let me take a minute to 
thank our staff: My chief of staff, Julie 
Nickson, who is here with us today; my 
legislative director, Gregory Adams; 
Congressman MEEKS’ staff; and all of 
the staff members who have worked for 
20 years to get us to this point. 
I also want to thank our Democratic 
and Republican cosponsors and our 
outside broad spectrum of groups, like 
the Friends Committee on National 
Legislation, Win Without War, the 
American Legion, and Americans for 
Prosperity that have fought alongside 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the Statement of Administra-
tion Policy and letters of support from 
many of these groups. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 256—REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE 
OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLU-
TION
OF
2002—REP. LEE, D–CA
WITH
134
CO- 
SPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of H.R. 256, to repeal the Authorization 
for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Reso-
lution of 2002 (‘‘2002 AUMF’’). This bipartisan 
legislation would terminate the October 16, 
2002, statutory authorization for the use of 
military force against Iraq. 
The Administration supports the repeal of 
the 2002 AUMF, as the United States has no 
ongoing military activities that rely solely 
on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, 
and repeal of the 2002 AUMF would likely 
have minimal impact on current military op-
erations. Furthermore, the President is com-
mitted to working with the Congress to en-
sure that outdated authorizations for the use 
of military force are replaced with a narrow 
and specific framework appropriate to en-
sure that we can continue to protect Ameri-
cans from terrorist threats. 
In working with the Congress on repealing 
and replacing other existing authorizations 
of military force, the Administration seeks 
to ensure that the Congress has a clear and 
thorough understanding of the effect of any 
such action and of the threats facing U.S. 
forces, personnel, and interests around the 
world. As the Administration works with the 
Congress to reform AUMFs, it will be critical 
to maintain the clear authority to address 
threats to the United States’ national inter-
ests with appropriately decisive and effective 
military action.

CVA URGES PASSAGE OF 2002 AUMF REPEAL 
GRASSROOTS VETERANS GROUP APPLAUDS REP. 
LEE, BIPARTISAN
LEADERSHIP
ON
CRITICAL 
MEASURE TO RESTORE BALANCE OF POWER 
ARLINGTON, VA.—Concerned Veterans for 
America (CVA) Executive Director Nate An-
derson released the following statement urg-
ing the U.S. House to pass H.R. 256, Rep. Bar-
bara Lee’s bill to repeal the 2002 Authoriza-
tion for the Use of Military Force (AUMF): 
‘‘Debating, 
authorizing, 
and 
exercising 
oversight of American military action is one 
of Congress’s most solemn duties. Unfortu-
nately, Congress has largely deferred to the 
executive branch and neglected its role in 
matters of war and peace over the last twen-
ty years. Repealing the 2002 AUMF would be 
an important step toward Congress re-
asserting its constitutional role in shaping 
foreign policy and giving the American peo-
ple a voice. We applaud Rep. Lee for her con-
tinued leadership on this issue along with 
the broad coalition of bipartisan representa-
tives and organizations who have found com-
mon ground in this endeavor.’’ 
BACKGROUND 
Americans for Prosperity, a partner of 
CVA, issued a Key Vote Alert for this meas-
ure, signaling it will take into account law-
makers’ votes in its annual legislative score-
card. 
CVA recently led a coalition in sending a 
letter to members of Congress urging sup-
port of a bipartisan resolution introduced by 
Sens. Kaine and Young to repeal a pair of ob-
solete AUMFs. The group was joined on the 
letter by Defense Priorities Initiative, Free-
dom Works, and the R Street institute. 
CVA has been working to repeal the out-
dated 2001 and 2002 AUMFs for years, making 
it a priority for its grassroots and advocacy 
efforts in its annual policy agendas (2019, 
2020, 2021). Notably, though less than a fifth 
of current members of Congress voted on the 
2001 AUMF, it has been invoked to justify 41 
operations in 19 countries since passage. 
In 2019, the group partnered with VoteVets, 
a traditional rival, to urge lawmakers to re-
claim their constitutional war powers duties. 
The New York Times wrote about the un-
likely partnership. Setting the example for 
lawmakers 
and 
the 
administration, 
the 
groups found common ground on this issue 
and flew activists and volunteers in to DC to 
meet with their members of Congress to 
bring lasting policy change in Washington. 
CVA has been staunch in its support of 
lawmakers who have taken a principled 
stand and worked to repeal these measures 
in the past. In 2019, CVA welcomed the addi-
tion of the bipartisan War Powers Caucus to 
Congress, 
applauding 
lawmakers 
for 
prioritizing the issue. CVA also launched a 
digital ad campaign thanking lawmakers for 
standing against endless war, praising law-
makers for voting to ensure proper Congres-
sional input before any offensive military 
force against Iran.

DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, As organiza-
tions from across the ideological spectrum, 
we are committed to addressing one of our 
country’s most critical national security 
needs: ending our forever wars. We don’t al-
ways agree on the reasons to do so, but we do

June 17, 2021 
agree that nearly two decades of endless war 
has failed to make us safer and a new ap-
proach is necessary. To achieve this goal and 
reorient U.S. foreign policy away from the 
unaccountable, 
interventionist 
approach 
we’ve seen for nearly two decades, Congress 
must sunset the 2001 Authorization for the 
Use of Military Force (AUMF) and repeal the 
2002 Iraq AUMF. 
Since its enactment on September 14, 2001, 
the 2001 AUMF has served as a blank check 
for endless, global war under multiple presi-
dents. Despite congressional intent to only 
give then-President George W. Bush the au-
thority to use military force against those 
responsible for the 9/11 attacks and those 
who harbored them, the law failed to include 
any time limits, geographic constraints, spe-
cific objectives or an exit strategy. As a re-
sult, three successive presidents have used 
the law to unilaterally expand the nation’s 
use of military force against individuals, 
groups, and even nation states never in-
tended by Congress. Presidents Bush, Obama, 
and Trump have used the 2001 AUMF to jus-
tify U.S. military action in 19 countries at 
least 41 times. The expansive U.S. milita-
rized counterterrorism footprint now extends 
to at least 80 countries, costing an estimated 
$6.4 trillion, as well as the lives of thousands 
of American soldiers, and hundreds of thou-
sands of civilians abroad. 
Congress passed the 2002 Iraq AUMF to au-
thorize force against the Saddam Hussein re-
gime. It is not required for any ongoing mili-
tary activities, as the executive branch re-
lies on an overly broad interpretation of the 
2001 AUMF for operations against ISIS, al 
Qaeda, and other groups. However, both the 
Obama and Trump administrations expanded 
their interpretation of the scope of the 2002 
Iraq AUMF beyond congressional intent. 
Most recently, the Trump administration 
cited it as a legal basis for the targeted kill-
ing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, an 
action clearly unrelated to the original 
scope of the authorization. Retaining this 
law renders it susceptible to further abuse. 
President Biden has stated a desire to end 
the forever wars. With this in mind, Congress 
should sunset the 2001 AUMF eight months 
after a law is enacted and immediately re-
peal the 2002 Iraq AUMF. Rather than expe-
diting a new AUMF, Congress must first pub-
licly debate whether military force is both 
necessary and appropriate for addressing 
current security challenges and what, if any, 
new legal authority may be necessary. In the 
interim, Article II of the Constitution pro-
vides the president with the legal authority 
needed to defend our country against an ac-
tual or truly imminent armed attack. 
With a new president who has signalled 
support for our government’s institutional 
checks and balances and a U.S. public that 
supports an end to endless war, it is time for 
Congress seize the opportunity to reassert 
its constitutional authority over war powers. 
In fact, the U.S. Constitution places the 
power to declare war squarely in the hands 
of Congress for good reason. Our democracy 
relies on the foundational belief that it is 
the people to whom the U.S. government re-
mains accountable, not the president. By as-
signing Congress the sole authority to de-
clare war, our nation’s founders sought to 
ensure that a decision as momentous as the 
one to wage war was properly debated, scru-
tinized, and justified. Failing to sunset the 
2001 AUMF and repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF 
now will continue to effectively cede Con-
gress’ power over war and peace to the exec-
utive branch. 
In the past five years, the House of Rep-
resentatives or its committees have voted to 
repeal both the 2001 AUMF and the 2002 Iraq 
AUMF, drawing both Democratic and Repub-
lican support. With a new administration 
who agrees that these authorizations are 
outdated, now is the time to finish the work 
Congress started. We urge you to join Rep. 
Barbara Lee’s effort in turning the page on 
this unsuccessful chapter of U.S. foreign pol-
icy by sunsetting the 2001 AUMF and repeal-
ing the 2002 Iraq AUMF.

AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY, 
June 15, 2021. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES, 
On 
behalf 
of 
Americans for Prosperity’s activists in all 50 
states, I urge you to vote ‘‘NO’’ on H.R. 1187, 
the so-called ‘‘Corporate Governance Im-
provement and Investor Protection Act.’’ 
Businesses can be a force for good when 
they serve customers, drive life-improving 
innovations, and enable employees to find 
fulfillment in their work. But the best way 
to do that is through bottom-up approaches, 
not top-down regulation. Mobilizing the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission to force 
industry from all corners of the economy to 
adhere to dubious, ambiguous, and one-size- 
fits all requirements—as this bill does—will 
only harm our ability to improve society and 
undermine America’s capacity to lead in the 
global economy. 
H.R. 1187 represents a sweeping expansion 
of government overreach and dramatic mis-
sion creep for the SEC, which has neither the 
authority, expertise, nor accountability to 
evaluate the materiality of these disclosures 
to shareholders and potential shareholders. 
Further, the standards these regulations set, 
and the effectiveness of the methods to 
which those standards would be met, are un-
clear. As an example, recent evidence has 
shown there is virtually no relationship be-
tween trends in energy-related carbon emis-
sions and top-down climate policies such as 
the implementation of international agree-
ments, carbon pricing, cap-and-trade, or 
command and control sectoral regulation. In 
fact, since the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA de-
cision, countries as well as states that have 
not endorsed these policies have generally 
reduced per capita energy-related carbon di-
oxide emissions at a far greater pace than 
those that have. 
Beyond this, the very act of forcing compa-
nies to meet preset, one-size-fits-all require-
ments ultimately undermines the leaps in 
innovation we need to actually achieve our 
shared goals for the environment and society 
as a whole. Business leaders and consumers— 
not politicians and appointed Washington of-
ficials—are the driving force to innovate and 
deliver superior products and services that 
solve for the needs of today while also push-
ing our country toward a better future that 
benefits all. 
This bill would also impose new costly bur-
dens on companies, open the floodgates to 
cronyism, undermine businesses’ ability to 
create new value, and ultimately put a drag 
on our recovering economy. 
We look forward to working together to 
improve the environment and address other 
great challenges facing our country. The 
best way to do that is through bottom-up in-
novation, not top-down regulation such as 
those mandated by this bill. 
I urge you to vote ‘‘NO’’ on H.R. 1187. This 
vote will be recorded in our legislative score-
card for the 117th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
BRENT GARDNER, 
Chief Government Affairs Officer, 
Americans for Prosperity. 
THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COMMANDER, 
Washington, DC, April 7, 2021. 
Hon. BARBARA LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE LEE: On behalf of 
the nearly two million members of The 
American Legion, I am pleased to express 
support for H.R. 256, which would repeal the 
Authorization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. Congress 
passed the 2002 AUMF to authorize force 
against Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi regime in 
order to defend the United States against the 
threat posed by the regime’s alleged posses-
sion of weapons of mass destruction. This 
threat proved unfounded and the mission un-
dertaken pursuant to the 2002 Iraq AUMF— 
designated ‘‘Operation Iraqi Freedom’’—offi-
cially ended on December 11, 2011. 
Our servicemembers have accomplished 
their original objectives in Iraq, a dangerous 
regime was removed, and the authorization 
for the war should end. With the under-
standing that complex global threats cannot 
be solved by military power alone, we value 
the importance of sustaining a civilian-led 
approach of elevating diplomacy and devel-
opment alongside a strong defense. The 
American Legion stands ready to assist 
members of Congress with strengthening our 
nation’s interests and ensuring that diplo-
macy is the first instrument of national 
power considered at the highest level. 
In accordance with American Legion Reso-
lution No. 22: Addressing the ‘Forever War’, 
passed unanimously by our National Execu-
tive Committee in meetings held October 14– 
15, 2020, which urges a renewal of a proper 
constitutional balance to American foreign 
policy decision-making by encouraging Con-
gress to repeal and replace outdated Author-
izations for Use of Military Force, we strong-
ly support this bill. 
We applaud your leadership in addressing 
this 
critical 
issue 
facing 
our 
nation’s 
servicemembers, veterans, and their fami-
lies. 
For God & Country, 
JAMES W. ‘‘BILL’’ OXFORD, 
National Commander. 
Ms. LEE of California. Let me just 
take a minute to honor my dear friend, 
the late Congressman Walter Jones, a 
Republican from North Carolina who 
was my partner for many years to 
build bipartisan support to bring our 
troops home. 
I am proud to stand with everyone as 
we exercise our most important duty 
assigned by the Constitution to decide 
when and how America goes to war. 
We cannot revise history as it relates 
to why this authorization was put into 
place. 
Eighteen years ago, in front of the 
infamous ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ ban-
ner backdrop, former President Bush 
told the Nation that the major combat 
operations in Iraq have ended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2902 
June 17, 2021 
In 2011, President Obama brought our 
combat troops home, and yet this au-
thority remains on the books, vulner-
able to misuse because Congress has 
not acted to remove it. 
The Bush administration, yes, misled 
the American people by saying there 
were weapons of mass destruction in 
Iraq, that Iraq posed an imminent 
threat by drawing a false connection 
between the tragic events of 9/11 and 
Saddam Hussein. Those lies and misin-
formation had deadly consequences. 
The mistakes continue to haunt us 
today. 
Once the war started, the Out of Iraq 
Caucus was founded by Congresswoman 
Lynn Woolsey, me, and led by Con-
gresswoman MAXINE WATERS. Over 80 
Members joined. Many of us took our 
protests to the streets, joining hun-
dreds of thousands protesting the un-
necessary, immoral war of choice. Year 
after year, we worked for the safe and 
orderly withdrawal of our troops. 
I share all this history, not because 
of nostalgia, but we have to remember 
why this authorization was passed, be-
cause 87 percent of current Members of 
the House were not here to vote on this 
AUMF in 2002. The Constitution re-
quires that we cannot appropriate 
funds for armies for more than 2 years, 
and yet for almost two decades we have 
failed to revisit these AUMFs. 
To this day, our endless wars con-
tinue, costing trillions of dollars and 
thousands of lives in a war that goes 
way beyond any scope that Congress 
conceived or intended. 
I want to salute our veterans, our 
young men and women in uniform. 
They did everything we have asked 
them to do. Many veterans support this 
repeal. 
The outdated 2002 AUMF bears no 
correlation to the threats we face 
today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 10 sec-
onds. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, the President earlier stated 
his support for the bill, saying that the 
2002 AUMF will not impact current 
military operations, but repeal can pre-
vent our country from entering an-
other protracted engagement under 
this outdated authority. 
We can’t afford to leave this in place 
indefinitely. For two decades it has 
been in place. This is our opportunity 
to restore our constitutional role. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would just like to comment that to 
me it is very interesting, the timing of 
the gentlewoman from California’s re-
peal. 
It 
happened 
after 
President 
Trump had an air strike to take out 
Soleimani in Iraq, at exactly the same 
time. He had authority to do so under 
the 2002 AUMF and Article II under the 
Constitution. 
What is interesting about now, the 
other side of the aisle was upset when 
President Biden struck the Shia prox-
ies in Syria, and that is when we saw 
this bill resurrect itself again in this 
Congress. Very interesting timing. 
What I object to is that now we are 
abdicating our responsibility by giving 
the President Article II authorities 
alone without any authorization of use 
of military force from the Congress. 
They talk a lot about Article I on the 
other side, but aren’t we abdicating our 
Article I responsibility? 
I am all for updating this thing, but 
to completely do away with it and just 
give this President Article II authori-
ties to do whatever he wants without 
any congressional review, in my judg-
ment, is a wrong step forward. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I will 
just 
say 
really 
quickly: 
Before 
Soleimani, we had passed a bill on the 
AUMF in 2019, so it wasn’t in response 
to President Trump. So this was at-
tempted even before that. 
I now yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), 
head of the United States delegation to 
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
and a member of our Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, 
Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Mem-
bers of the Bush administration seized 
on our fear at that time to persuade 
Americans that Saddam Hussein posed 
a grave threat to the United States, 
and Congress passed an Authorization 
for Use of Military Force without any 
limitation on how long it could be in 
effect. 
Nineteen years later, and ten years 
after we formally ended ground oper-
ations, it is still law. This is an abroga-
tion of Article I responsibilities and 
duties of the Congress of the United 
States. 
There is no more profound power 
vested in us in the Constitution than to 
send our young men and women into 
combat. It is long past time that we 
dealt with this AUMF and righted the 
imbalance between the powers of Arti-
cle I, which are exclusively those of 
Congress, and the powers of Article II 
for a Commander in Chief only after 
Congress has acted. 
I am proud to support this measure 
today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), a 
member of our HFAC committee with 
strong foreign affairs credentials. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
on October 16, 2002, the United States 
Congress voted to authorize military 
action against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. 
The text of the authorization was 
clear. That was its purpose. Years 
later, Saddam Hussein is long dead, 
and our military action has ended. 
The 2002 AUMF is separate and dis-
tinct from the 2001 AUMF, which au-
thorized our counterterrorism efforts 
after 9/11 and which remains in use 
today. 
The 2002 AUMF is not in use. It is 
long overdue for repeal, which is why 
we have voted multiple times to repeal 
the 2002 AUMF with bipartisan support. 
Since coming to Congress, I have 
been very clear, Congress must reassert 
congressional authority in decisions of 
war and peace. The authority is re-
quired by our Constitution, and it is 
fundamental to our representation of 
our constituents, especially our serv-
icemembers. 
Our men and women in uniform de-
serve to see a new era of congressional 
accountability, one where Members of 
Congress do not shirk their account-
ability when it comes to issues of war 
and peace. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. JACOBS), the vice 
chair of the subcommittee on Inter-
national Development, International 
Organizations, and Global Corporate 
Social Impact. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to support this 
critical legislation to repeal the 2002 
Authorization For Use of Military 
Force. 
I want to thank Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE and the chair of this com-
mittee for their enduring leadership on 
this issue. 
I was in middle school when Congress 
passed this authorization to use force 
against Saddam Hussein’s regime in 
Iraq. Today, as a Member of this body, 
I am voting to repeal it. 
I make this point to remind my col-
leagues that the decisions around war 
and peace are some of the most con-
sequential ones we make here. My gen-
eration has spent our entire adult lives 
in the shadow of two long and pro-
tracted wars. 
I am proud to represent San Diego, a 
military community that has made in-
credible sacrifices because of that vote 
in 2002. Now it is time to take it off the 
books. 
Repealing this authorization would 
not impact any of our current military 
operations, but repealing it will pre-
vent a future President from abusing it 
and reclaim Congress’ rightful role in 
authorizing war, ensuring our service-
members know that they are not being 
sent to harm’s way without a full de-
bate of this representative body. There 
is nothing rushed about something 
that has taken 20 years. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this repeal. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just clarify again. This bill 
was filed last Congress after President 
Trump took out the mastermind of ter-
ror for two decades in the Middle East, 
Qasem Soleimani, to challenge his au-
thority to take out one of the biggest

threats to the region and to our Amer-
ican soldiers, 600 of whom were killed 
and thousands wounded. 
That is the genesis for this legisla-
tion, and I think that is important to 
note. If we do away with this without 
replacing it, we abdicate our Article I 
authorities in an absolute manner to 
the executive branch under Article II. 
I think that it is important for any-
one watching this debate to understand 
what we are doing here today. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KINZINGER). 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
remember over the period of the last 
Presidency joining my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle at various times 
when statements were made that we 
are just going to leave Iraq or we are 
going to leave the Kurds in Syria, and 
I think that was shortsighted, those 
statements, so I joined my colleagues 
on both sides. 
But, yet, today, we are debating the 
repeal of the 2002 AUMF as if we all 
somehow believe that we are going to 
magically repeal this and then come up 
with some narrow replacement that is 
going to authorize, when we can’t real-
ly agree that the sky is blue in this 
group. 
But I want to, for a second, look back 
and say what would have happened 
when this was introduced originally. 
So in January of 2014 this repeal was 
introduced. Let’s say we passed it. 
What happened since January of 2014? 
Well, I will tell you. In June of 2014 we 
began airstrikes against ISIS. Because 
of the 2002 AUMF, we were able to as-
sist our allies to defeat ISIS in their 
capital of Raqqa, their stronghold in 
Mosul, and we even destroyed their ca-
liphate throughout the region. 
I know my colleagues who support 
this legislation have the right inten-
tions in mind, but even President 
Biden’s own Statement of Administra-
tion Policy admits that this repeal 
would have an impact on our military 
operations. That is why we don’t call 
for a blanket repeal, but a narrowly 
crafted replacement. Let’s do that 
first. 
The bleak reality is that without an 
authorization to fight terror, more in-
nocent human beings will suffer. Let us 
not forget the horrors that ISIS per-
petrated on innocent men, women, and 
children. Men were beheaded for prac-
ticing their faith, women were stoned 
to death for trying to flee abusive rela-
tionships. Children were made foot sol-
diers and suicide bombers. Without this 
AUMF, this would still be happening. 
Today, we have militia groups at-
tacking the American Embassy in 
Baghdad. We have malign forces trying 
to destabilize the democratically elect-
ed Iraqi Government. We have dozens 
of terror organizations, including ISIS, 
that want to revive the caliphate 
which brought so much pain and suf-
fering to so many in the region. 
Before we hastily pass this ill- 
thought-out and ill-timed political leg-
islation, I urge every Member to meet 
with Intel, to meet with the Depart-
ment of Defense to hear about the re-
alities of the threats we face in this 
world, and maybe once that happens 
and we put aside these partisan stripes 
for a moment, we can have an honest 
debate 
about 
what 
a 
replacement 
would look like. Short-term political 
gain has no impact on what foreign ac-
tors make in terms of their policy deci-
sions. ISIS and terrorists don’t change 
based on what we debate here, and they 
certainly didn’t give up yet. 
We made a decision; the President 
made a decision to leave Afghanistan. 
While I disagree with that, I certainly 
hope he is successful and that my pre-
dictions are wrong, but I do know that 
that sent a message. It sent a message 
that America is disengaging in the war 
on terror. What would this send as 
well, right on the heels of this? 
What message would this send to the 
terrorists who are on the ropes, who 
haven’t attacked in the United States, 
not because they don’t want to, but be-
cause we haven’t let them because we 
have fought them on their territory, 
before they have the ability to organize 
and attack us here? 
What does that message send? Be-
cause to a terrorist, all they need is 
the ability to go out and say, ‘‘We are 
winning,’’ to recruit somebody, to give 
their life for that terrorist cause. 
Madam Speaker, I understand where 
this is coming from. I deeply would 
love an AUMF that replaces this the 
right way, but this is the wrong process 
and the wrong order to do that. So I 
urge my colleagues to join me in oppos-
ing this. 
b 0945 
Mr. MEEKS. I want to remind the 
gentleman that the 2014 strike against 
ISIS, the primary AUMF, where it was 
utilized in the 2001 AUMF, continues 
and still is in existence. Also, when you 
talk about Soleimani, the primary uti-
lization, still-President Trump talked 
about Article II. So those still are in 
existence to protect the American peo-
ple and at the President’s options. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. CLARK), the assistant Speaker. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, 19 years ago, this 
body passed the 2002 Authorization for 
Use of Military Force based on lies and 
misinformation about Saddam Hus-
sein’s weapons of mass destruction. 
This authorization has entangled us 
in a decades-long war, costing billions 
of dollars and tens of thousands of 
lives. 
Millions of young people in this coun-
try, including my three children, have 
never known an America that wasn’t at 
war. 
This repeal is long overdue and abso-
lutely vital to protecting the integrity 
of our system of checks and balances 
and the security of our Nation and 
servicemembers. 
Today we stand up for Congress’ con-
stitutional war powers and the right to 
say ‘‘no’’ to conflicts abroad and ‘‘yes’’ 
to peace. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST), a combat veteran, 
a distinguished servicemember, and a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, war 
powers and AUMF, it is a distant im-
personal term to talk about the work 
of the warfighter. And I think for peo-
ple on both sides of the aisle, it is any-
thing but impersonal. 
Probably all of us in here know peo-
ple who have passed in our wars, roads 
named after them, schools named after 
them, 
VFWs, 
and 
other 
buildings 
named after them. It is not impersonal 
to those of us in here and to those who 
have been targeted by snipers, have 
had ordnance dropped on them, walked 
across fields of improvised explosive 
devices, were burned alive in Humvees 
and other pieces of equipment that 
they served their time in. 
It is not impersonal to us. We all 
know the stories. And I like to believe 
that we do take that very seriously. 
And there is broad-based consensus 
on the fact that these AUMFs need to 
be changed. But to do that and to have 
the appropriate responsibility to those 
who go out there and fight the wars, we 
have to talk to the people who go out 
there and command the battles, that 
sit in the JOC and sit in the TOC, and 
sit in the Pentagon. 
But, instead, what we did was we had 
professors from NYU and Harvard and 
Yale come in and speak to us for a few 
minutes about their opinions. 
But what I can tell you is that a bat-
tlefield looks nothing like a lecture 
hall or a faculty lounge. They are not 
the same things. And their opinions are 
not nearly as weighty as those of the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
or the Secretary of Defense or the Sec-
retary of the Army or the Secretary of 
the Navy or the Commandant of the 
Marine Corps or one of our combatant 
commanders. 
If we take seriously this power that 
the 435 of us in this body have, not just 
to cast a vote, but to cast an informed 
vote to say that we went out there and 
did every bit of diligence that we could, 
it means speaking to those individuals, 
asking those questions, and then com-
ing to the conclusions that bring us to 
the votes that we cast. 
But without that, we are acting on 
pure arrogance that we know better 
without asking any questions, that we 
know what to do without going out 
there and seeking any facts, without 
finding out how this will affect the de-
fense of our homeland. And it is not 
what gives the honor and respect to 
those who go out there and defend this 
country. It is not what gives the honor 
and respect to them that they deserve. 
Mr. 
MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his service, 
and I really respect him for what he

put on the line for our country. We will 
always do that. 
But I will also say that those individ-
uals who we did bring before the com-
mittee, though they might be profes-
sors now, they either served in the 
DOD or the White House, plus we had a 
classified briefing in the auditorium 
with representatives from the Joint 
Chiefs. So we were making sure that 
we had to get all of the information 
that we could in regards to this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
OMAR), the vice chair of the Sub-
committee on Africa, Global Health 
and Global Human Rights and the Sub-
committee on International Develop-
ment, International Organizations, and 
Global Corporate Social Impact. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding, and I thank 
the distinguished author of this legisla-
tion, Congresswoman LEE, for bringing 
forth this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, for the past 20 
years, the 2002 Authorization has been 
used to wage war and cause destruction 
around the world. 
While many in this Congress have 
participated in war, I am someone who 
has endured war and understands the 
impact it has on innocent lives. The 
act of war does nothing to make us 
safer. 
Engaging in endless wars has led us 
to undermining our most important 
morals: peace, liberty, and justice. 
Congress cannot sit idly by as we 
take more civilian lives and decrease 
our ability to build prosperity at home. 
The more we spend on endless wars, 
the less we are able to invest in our 
own people with education, housing, 
and employment opportunities. 
I am pleased that Congress is finally 
working on restoring its authority over 
matters of peace and war. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his comments about 
us seeking advice on Authorization for 
Use of Military Force from academics 
from Harvard, Yale, and NYU. And 
though they may have spent time serv-
ing in defense roles, I would remind the 
chairman that in the hearings that 
these academics voiced their opinions 
in, they expressed numerous times that 
they didn’t even have the access to in-
formation that we had. They said it 
over and over. They didn’t have the an-
swers that we might have the answers 
to. 
I would say it is incumbent upon this 
body to seek answers not from those 
who say we have more information, but 
to ask somebody who may potentially 
have more information than us so that 
we can make a more informed decision 
about policy that we are tasked with 
voting on that affects so many. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the chair of the 
Small Business Committee. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 256. 
Let me first recognize the tireless ef-
forts of Representative BARBARA LEE, 
who has spearheaded this issue for 
nearly two decades and has been the 
moral conscience in Congress against 
endless, unjust wars. 
The decision to go to war is one of 
the most profound and consequential a 
nation can make. This 2002 AUMF is 
outdated, and its repeal will end its 
legal authority to justify U.S. inter-
vention in Iraq. 
Under the Constitution, Congress has 
the sole duty to declare war. By repeal-
ing this authorization today, we are 
working to return this power back to 
the people’s House and the Senate. 
That is how a checks and balances sys-
tem works. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CALVERT), a member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 256. 
Though 
a 
combat-tested 
security 
partner, Iraq continues to be a fragile 
state. The 2002 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force allowed the United 
States to end Saddam Hussein’s reign 
of terror. It also allowed us to return 
and assist the people of Iraq when deci-
sions made by the Obama-Biden admin-
istration led to the formation of ISIS 
and enabled the terror group to estab-
lish a caliphate in northwestern Iraq in 
2014. 
Now, that same Authorization for 
Use of Military Force provides the 
United States with the legal authority 
for military operations in support of 
our Iraqi partners, if needed, and 
against terrorist threats in Iraq, in-
cluding those from the Iran-backed mi-
litia groups. 
This critical piece of legislation pro-
vided the authority for last year’s 
strike on Iran’s terror mastermind 
Soleimani, whose IEDs, I might remind 
people, killed more than 600 American 
soldiers and wounded thousands more. 
The Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force also provides authority to 
strike 
Iranian-backed 
Shia 
militia 
groups that have and are currently at-
tacking Americans in Iraq. 
This shortsighted and purely polit-
ical effort to repeal the authority with-
out a replacement sends the wrong 
message and will embolden the Islamic 
terror groups and the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terror, Iran. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this bill until we have a viable replace-
ment that addresses the threat of Iran 
and its proxies. 
We have already turned our backs on 
Afghanistan. We should not repeat this 
error in Iraq. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), our illustrious 
leader and Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership in bringing this im-
portant and overdue legislation to the 
floor. 
Congratulations to you, Mr. Chair-
man, for being the chair of the com-
mittee and, as your ranking member 
has said, striving to act in a very bi-
partisan way. That doesn’t hold for 
today necessarily; but, nonetheless, 
where there is a will, there is a way. 
Madam Speaker, nearly 20 years have 
passed since the Congress passed the 
2002 Authorization for Use of Military 
Force, and 10 years have passed since 
the formal end of U.S. military oper-
ations: Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Yet, today, 10 years later, our Nation 
is still operating under an outdated 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force, which risks being used, and in 
some cases has been used, as a blank 
check to conduct unrelated military 
operations. 
Let me be clear. Repealing the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force in no way precludes us, our coun-
try, from defending our military and 
diplomatic personnel in Iraq. Article II 
of the Constitution, the 2001 AUMF, 
and the bilateral agreements with Iraq 
permit this. 
But it will prevent a situation in 
which U.S. military personnel are de-
ployed or military operations are con-
ducted, without the approval of Con-
gress or the country, for purposes that 
are unconnected to the AUMF’s origi-
nal purpose. 
We are here because of the courage of 
Congresswoman BARBARA LEE. No one 
has been fiercer or more relentless or 
more principled on this issue. I thank 
Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and oth-
ers who have worked with her over the 
years. 
I thank also our Foreign Affairs 
chair, GREGORY MEEKS, who has moved 
this bipartisan priority with both ur-
gency and unity through the com-
mittee. 
b 1000 
We are pleased that this legislation, 
which has previously passed the House 
twice, has over 130 cosponsors. Thank 
you, also, to Senator TIM
KAINE, a 
longtime leader on AUMF repeal and 
reform in the Senate, who has intro-
duced a companion bill in the Senate. 
Repealing the 2002 AUMF will defend 
Congress’ 
constitutional 
authorities 
and our American democracy’s system 
of separation of powers. 
Under the Constitution, it is the Con-
gress that has the sole duty to declare 
war. We must reassert that authority 
to decide if and when our country goes 
to war. 
This repeal is also possible because of 
the leadership of President Joe Biden, 
who understands and has respect for 
Congress’ constitutional authorities. 
He understands the need for this action 
to keep our troops and the American 
people safe. Again, that is our first re-
sponsibility: to protect and defend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2905 
June 17, 2021 
The Congress stands in agreement 
with the Biden-Harris administration, 
which has stated that ‘‘the President is 
committed to working with the Con-
gress to ensure that outdated author-
izations for the use of military force 
are replaced with a narrow and specific 
framework appropriate to ensure that 
we can continue to protect Americans 
from terrorist threats.’’ 
Why has that been elusive, for us to 
come up with a better, more focused 
plan? 
Madam Speaker, just for public infor-
mation, when we have tried to come up 
with a newer, fresher, more appropriate 
AUMF, we have three challenges. 
What is the scope? What is the Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
for? Is it for boots on the ground? Is it 
for air? What is it for? What is the 
scope that we are giving the authority 
to the executive branch to use? 
What is the geography? How far does 
that extend? Is this global? Is it spe-
cific to a region? 
These are important decisions be-
cause some of the threats are, shall we 
say, unpredictable. But that doesn’t 
mean what we do here should be unpre-
dictable. 
The third is the timing. How long 
does it last? What is it for? How far in 
geography does it extend? And how 
long does that authority last? 
Over time, as we have tried to re-
place this outdated Authorization for 
Use of Military Force, we have run into 
those disagreements internally as well 
as with the White House. But the more 
the public knows about our commit-
ment to honoring our constitutional 
responsibility—and we will work with a 
President who is not here to undermine 
that—hopefully, we will have that au-
thorization, as necessary, as we go for-
ward. 
As Members of Congress, the first 
duty we have is to keep the American 
people safe. That includes our coura-
geous men and women in uniform, who 
sacrifice every day for our freedoms. 
To do this, we must pursue a Na-
tional Security Strategy and a defense 
policy that are smart, strong, and stra-
tegic. And we look forward to working 
with the administration on this vital 
mission. 
With that, I again salute our distin-
guished colleague from California, Con-
gresswoman BARBARA LEE, for her per-
sistence and her leadership; our distin-
guished 
chairman, 
Mr. 
GREGORY 
MEEKS. 
Again, I am grateful for the cour-
teous consideration of this legislation 
today, although we may not be in com-
plete agreement. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote 
for H.R. 256, to repeal the 2002 Author-
ization for Use of Military Force, and 
hope that we will have a strong bipar-
tisan vote. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS), the chair-
woman of the Committee on Financial 
Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from New York, Chair-
man GREGORY MEEKS, for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of Congresswoman BARBARA LEE’s reso-
lution to repeal the outdated 2002 
AUMF, which was used to start the 
Iraq war, which killed more than 4,500 
American soldiers and approximately 
200,000 Iraqi civilians. 
As the chair of the Out of Iraq Cau-
cus, I worked with Congresswoman LEE 
and our former colleague, Lynn Wool-
sey, to end the Iraq war and bring our 
troops home. 
The Iraq war finally ended in Decem-
ber 2011. We cannot allow this outdated 
AUMF to be used as a blank check for 
future wars. It is long past time for 
Congress to reassert its constitutional 
role in authorizing and providing over-
sight over United States military ac-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the resolution. 
The United States Congress has the 
sole constitutional power to declare 
war and, therefore, a constitutional 
duty to consider, debate, and, if nec-
essary, repeal an Authorization for Use 
of Military Force. 
The very title of this AUMF shows 
how much it has strayed from its origi-
nal purpose. The 2002 Authorization for 
Use of Military Force Against Iraq was 
designed to address the threat posed by 
an Iraq run by Saddam Hussein. He has 
been dead for many years. 
We have the responsibility to mem-
bers of the Armed Forces who risk 
their lives, and the American public 
who fund these seemingly endless con-
flicts, to terminate the current 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force. Since 2009, I voted consistently 
to revoke this open-ended authoriza-
tion and to reassert Congress’ role. 
For too long, we have failed this re-
sponsibility. Congress must act now to 
repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force Against Iraq. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), a distinguished Member. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
we, who are honored to be Members of 
Congress, are here to pass judgment on 
the great issues of our time. There is 
no greater issue of our time than the 
issue of war and peace. It is about life 
and death. 
We should not be allowed to escape 
our duty, responsibility, and obligation 
to vote on issues of war and peace. 
We must repeal this authorization so 
that Congress can take up its responsi-
bility and vote on the great issues of 
our time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO). 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for recognizing me and yield-
ing time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
resolution to repeal the AUMF resolu-
tion of 2002. Here we are, in 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I voted against that 
AUMF, and to this day, I believe it pro-
duced one of the worst foreign policy 
disasters in U.S. history. It was built 
on a lie; it claimed the lives of over 
4,400 Americans and countless Iraqi ci-
vilians; and it cost our Treasury tril-
lions of dollars. 
The Iraq war ended 10 years ago, but 
this AUMF is still on the books. It is a 
blank check, and we need to get rid of 
it. We run the risk that administra-
tions will misuse it to justify future 
military action and directly undermine 
Congress’ Article I war powers author-
ity. 
The House has voted three times to 
repeal this AUMF, and today, it is time 
to pass it. Let us have a victory here 
on the floor—and celebrate another 
victory that the Supreme Court has 
upheld the Affordable Care Act. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, it is now 
my honor to recognize a gentleman 
who I want to thank for his service, for 
he is a Marine combat veteran who 
served in Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO). 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 256 to repeal 
the 2002 Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force that sent me and thousands 
of other young Americans into war in 
Iraq. 
Even though the mission in Iraq has 
been over for almost a decade, this au-
thorization remains on the books. This 
is not a mistake or an oversight. It is 
a dangerous abdication of Congress’ re-
sponsibility. 
The longer this AUMF is on the 
books, the more opportunity it has to 
be abused as a blank check for military 
action in the Middle East without the 
input of the American people. 
The longer this AUMF is on the 
books, the longer we in Congress are 
bending our own moral and constitu-
tional duty to debate and to decide 
when to send American soldiers into 
harm’s way and to look into the eyes of 
servicemen and -women when we do. 
We cannot run from this incredible re-
sponsibility any longer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in passing this bill and re-
taking Congress’ constitutional role in 
exercising our war powers.

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES), my friend. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was a sophomore in 
high school when Congress gave the 
green light for war in Iraq. Nearly 20 
years later, I am here as a freshman 
Member of Congress, urging my col-
leagues to repeal that authorization. 
For over half my life, Republican and 
Democratic Presidential administra-
tions have used the 2002 Authorization 
for Use of Military Force as a blank 
check for war and the justification for 
aggressive military actions in the Mid-
dle East. 
Young 
people 
today 
have 
never 
known a time when our country was 
not fighting overseas or conducting 
strikes on poor and Brown nations. It 
is time for that to stop. 
The American people are tired of end-
less wars. We need a more peaceful and 
productive foreign policy grounded in 
diplomacy and human rights, and we, 
finally, have an administration that 
agrees. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding and for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong sup-
port of this resolution, Congresswoman 
LEE’s longtime effort to repeal the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force. 
The Constitution is clear: Only Con-
gress has the power to authorize war. 
In 2002, this resolution was adopted 
in order to address the ongoing threat 
from Saddam Hussein and his regime in 
Iraq, the threat that it represented to 
America. Saddam Hussein is gone. A 
new government has been established 
in Iraq, and this AUMF is obsolete. 
There are threats to the United 
States, and we have the authority to 
address those threats when they arise. 
There are ongoing threats that we 
ought to be able to debate here on the 
floor of the House of Representatives 
and act upon when our security is 
threatened. But no President of any 
party should ever be able to reach back 
two decades when Congress, on a dif-
ferent fact situation, authorized the 
use of force in order to authorize any 
use of force that they deemed to be im-
portant to them. 
Congress has this authority, and we 
need to assert it. That is what we do 
today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just a brief comment, 
once again, that repealing this Author-
ization for Use of Military Force, 
which has been used in the past to take 
out Soleimani and other very bad ac-
tors, and not replacing it does not up-
hold our Article I responsibilities. 
Mr. Speaker, in fact, what we are 
doing is ceding our authority under the 
Constitution to the executive branch 
and saying: Oh, Article II, the Presi-
dent has unlimited discretion under 
Article II to do whatever the hell he 
wants to do. 
That is not what this Congress 
should be doing. We need to replace 
this with an updated AUMF that re-
flects the threats in the region, the 
current threats, which are Iran and the 
proxies of Iran that have hit our em-
bassy, have killed our soldiers, and are 
attacking our diplomats in the region. 
b 1015 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just say to my friend from Texas that 
maybe we should do—if you think Iran 
is a threat—an AUMF for Iran. This 
AUMF was for Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this resolution to re-
peal an almost two decades-long Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
against Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by 
saying thank you, thank you, thank 
you to my colleague, Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE. 
I was an activist back in 2001, leading 
the largest immigrant advocacy orga-
nization and the largest march at the 
time against the war in Iraq, because 
we knew that what was happening was 
wrong. And we were looking at Con-
gress, and saying, Congress needs to 
make sure they are taking action, and 
BARBARA LEE stood up at that time on 
her own. 
The 2002 AUMF was based on a lie; a 
lie that has resulted in hundreds of 
thousands of lives lost, including civil-
ians, U.S. servicemembers, journalists, 
humanitarian workers; a lie that was 
used as the legal basis for military hos-
tilities beyond Iraq, hostilities that 
were never authorized by Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, this must be the begin-
ning and not the end of our work to end 
endless wars. We must continue our 
work to forge a meaningful engage-
ment with the rest of the world toward 
a lasting peace. Mr. Speaker, I also 
thank the chairman for his tremendous 
leadership. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Just a point of clarification to the 
chairman. I am not talking about a 
declaration of war against Iran. What 
we are talking about is what is the cur-
rent threat in Iraq. Today, it is prox-
ies, the Shia proxies of Iran in Iraq. 
The reason why President Biden hit 
them in Syria, it is the authorities 
that President Trump used to take out 
Soleimani 
in 
Iraq, 
not 
in 
Iran. 
Soleimani, ‘‘The Butcher’’, the master-
mind of terror for two decades, killing 
600 American soldiers and wounding 
thousands more. 
I am all for updating this thing, but 
to replace this and throw it out with 
not anything to protect our men and 
women who are in Iraq today, includ-
ing the diplomats, is highly irrespon-
sible, it is reckless, and it is dangerous. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I will vote, once again, to repeal 
the 2002 Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force because we cannot continue 
endless wars. 
Congress passed the 2002 AUMF au-
thorization for war again Saddam Hus-
sein’s regime. I voted against that res-
olution. And, now, here we are nearly 
20 years later, and we have seen three 
successive 
administrations 
use 
the 
AUMF to wage war in ways that were 
never intended, that were way beyond 
the scope of the congressional author-
ization that was used. 
Only Congress has the authority to 
declare war. And it is time for us to re-
claim that authority. We can’t let an-
other day go by with this authorization 
in place. We cannot support endless 
wars. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ROGERS), the lead Repub-
lican on the House Armed Services 
Committee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, let me start by saying that this ar-
gument that we have to get rid of the 
AUMF is just ridiculous. We pass the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
every year. We have passed it every 
year for 60 consecutive years. If we 
don’t want to authorize something we 
are doing militarily, we can stop it at 
any time. So this is a false argument 
that we have to do this to be able to 
prevent what we are doing in Afghani-
stan or Iraq or anyplace else. 
But with regard to this specific bill, 
this is a bad deal for our national secu-
rity and the safety of American serv-
icemembers overseas. Since the libera-
tion of Iraq, the murderous Iranian re-
gime has armed proxy organizations to 
kill Americans and innocent Iraqis. 
Iran has armed proxy militias with 
small arms, mortars, rockets, and now 
sophisticated UAVs that can avoid base 
defenses. The Obama and Trump ad-
ministrations both used the 2002 AUMF 
to target terrorist threats originating 
from Iraq. 
Threats 
like 
ISIS 
and 
militias 
backed by Iran have killed and injured 
American servicemembers and contrac-
tors. This bill would repeal the 2002 
AUMF and offer nothing in its place; 
no authorization to mop up ISIS forces 
or whatever movement comes next; no 
authorization to target Iranian proxies 
whose sole goal is to destabilize Iraq 
and kill Americans. 
This bill only offers the illusion of 
withdrawal. Like President Biden’s

failing Afghanistan strategy, it does 
nothing to change the reality on the 
ground in Iraq. The threats we face 
today will remain, and American com-
manders will be forced to face those 
threats with one fewer tool than they 
had the day before. 
Repealing the 2002 AUMF without a 
replacement only undermines our na-
tional security. It offers no real solu-
tion to the issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to remind my friend that this 2002 
AUMF has not been utilized as the sole 
reason or the sole authority in over 10 
years. The 2001 AUMF is still in effect. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
BROWN), who is a colonel, retired, and 
we thank him for his service in our 
military. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Congresswoman LEE
for her 
leadership on repealing the 2002 AUMF. 
That was the authorization that sent 
me and hundreds of thousands of serv-
icemen and -women to Iraq since the 
invasion in 2003. The justification for 
that war was fundamentally flawed. 
But to be certain, the purpose of the 
2002 AUMF established a broad mili-
tary mission in Iraq. Yet, I have no 
doubt that that mission that we were 
given has been completed. And, sadly, 
the Nation has lost more than 4,400 
brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Ma-
rines who were engaged in Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. 
It is time for us, for Congress and the 
American people, to formally recognize 
the end of America’s 2002 mission in 
Iraq. This is an important first step. As 
Congress, once again, reasserts its re-
sponsibility in the use of our military 
forces by authorizing frameworks that 
address current threats to our Nation 
and that we authorize the use of mili-
tary force only as the last resort. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gen-
tleman. We need to exercise our Article 
I constitutional responsibilities and 
update this outdated AUMF. That is 
precisely what we are arguing today. 
We are not saying that we should re-
place this, but we shouldn’t repeal 
without an updated AUMF that re-
flects the modern-day threats. 
As I close later, I will talk about the 
chairman and I working on that effort. 
That is what this body should be doing, 
because otherwise, if we repeal this, we 
are again ceding our Article I respon-
sibilities to the executive, and just giv-
ing him unlimited Article II powers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE), and I 
thank the gentlewoman for her bipar-
tisan spirit in coming down to the floor 
today to speak on this AUMF. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle for giving me a minute on 
this issue. I want to thank our veterans 
that have given lifelong service to 
their country. 
Nearly two decades ago, Congress au-
thorized the wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, but ever since, three President’s, 
both Republican and Democrat, have 
used this permission to drag out con-
flicts and to get us into new ones. 
Americans who weren’t even alive on 
9/11 or during the invasion of Iraq are 
still fighting and dying there, in Syria, 
across Africa, and who knows where 
else. Our Founders wisely gave Con-
gress the exclusive constitutional au-
thority over whether our Nation goes 
to war. 
Sadly, Congress has failed to perform 
this sacred duty for far too long. This 
is about restoring the powers set forth 
in Article I. Congress can go to war 
with anyone under Article I. When 
Washington drags us into a war, they 
aren’t the ones who go do the fighting 
and dying, our children are. The very 
least we can do is give their parents a 
say in when and where and if their kids 
will fight and die thousands of miles 
away. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think I laid out our 
arguments, and I think it is irrespon-
sible to repeal this authority, which 
still is used to protect our embassy dip-
lomats and soldiers in Iraq against the 
Shia proxies of Iran. 
I am committed to work with the 
chairman to update this outdated 
AUMF. And I think if there is any 
agreement in this Chamber, and also 
on both sides of the aisle, it is that we 
need to modernize it to the modern-day 
threats. 
And as I read from the President’s 
Statement of Administration Policy, 
the President says: I am committed to 
working with the Congress to ensure 
that outdated authorizations for the 
use of military force are replaced with 
a framework appropriate to ensure 
that we can continue to protect Ameri-
cans from terrorist threats. 
I agree with the President of the 
United States, and I think the chair-
man does as well. We have to do this, 
and it is not going to be easy, but it is 
time to update this outdated AUMF. 
I would prefer to have repealed and 
replaced it with our updated AUMF. 
But as BRIAN MAST, a heroic veteran 
who lost his legs in battle, said, We 
cannot just repeal this and talk about 
updating when we haven’t even talked 
to the Department of Defense, the Sec-
retary of State, and the intelligence 
community about what is the modern- 
day threat, and what we need to do in 
Congress to exercise our Article I re-
sponsibilities that we have a responsi-
bility to do, and not just cede every-
thing to the executive branch under 
Article II. 
The argument is made, well, this 
could be done under Article II. Well, 
that is probably true. But are we not 
abdicating 
our 
responsibility 
and 
ceding it to the executive branch by 
doing this? I would argue that we are. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close with the 
motion to recommit. 
If we adopt the motion to recommit, 
we will instruct the Committee on For-
eign Affairs to consider my amendment 
to H.R. 256. It responds to the serious 
escalation by Hamas against Israel 
that we saw in May. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARBAJAL). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
b 1030 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, Hamas 
launched over 4,000 rockets at our clos-
est allies in the Middle East. This was 
a stark reminder of the dangerous 
threats that Israel faces from Hamas, 
Hezbollah, Iran, and other terrorist or-
ganizations. 
For this reason, our MTR makes sure 
that the United States can quickly 
react to Israel’s security needs in the 
event of future attacks. 
If enacted, this language would es-
tablish contingency plans to provide 
Israel with defense articles such as mu-
nitions, ISR technology, aircraft, and 
related services. It would also create a 
waiver to expedite arms transfers if 
Israel is under threat of military at-
tack. 
This language passed the House last 
Congress with broad bipartisan sup-
port, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to support it today. 
I fear that the 2002 AUMF repeal we 
are considering today without a re-
placement may embolden our adver-
saries, 
especially 
Iran—the 
largest 
state sponsor of terror in the world— 
and its proxies by signaling that we are 
retreating from the Middle East. 
Our MTR is intended to send a strong 
message that this is absolutely false. It 
will also send a message that passage 
will demonstrate our ironclad support 
for Israel and all our allies in the re-
gion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the motion to recommit today, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for his hard 
work. As he has indicated, it is a pleas-
ure working with him on this com-
mittee and working collectively and 
having open and honest dialog where 
we agree and where we disagree. The 
manner in which we do that, I think, 
serves this body in a very good way, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
work with him in that regard. 
Even though we see this a little dif-
ferently, I will say right now that I am

ready to work with the gentleman in 
repealing and replacing the 2001 AUMF. 
I think that is what we utilized as pri-
mary for the 2014 ISIS issue in dealing 
with all of the terrorists and terrorism 
that is going on. But the 2002 AUMF 
was specific to Iraq. 
Our duty and our responsibility in 
what took place is over. There comes a 
time when certain AUMFs simply be-
come outdated and need to be repealed. 
We are going to do two others. We have 
an AUMF still on the books from 1957. 
We have another one that is on the 
books from 1991. There is no need to re-
peal and replace. They are outdated. 
Once they become outdated, let’s just 
remove them from the books. 
So let me again reiterate this: the re-
pealing of the 2002 AUMF would have 
no effect on any outgoing military op-
erations in Iraq. In fact, the only thing 
leaving the AUMF on the books does is 
risk inviting future administrations to 
try to stretch its legal authority and 
bypass Congress’ constitutional obliga-
tion to make decisions on matters of 
war and peace, thereby getting past 
and 
abdicating 
our 
responsibilities 
under Article I authority and allow the 
executive to interpret the AUMFs far 
beyond their intent. 
So the repeal of the 2002 AUMF is 
only one in a series of steps that Con-
gress must take to reclaim its Article 
I authority, but it is, indeed, an impor-
tant step. Today’s historic vote is a 
turning point to quickly bring an end 
to this outdated AUMF. I understand 
from listening to the Senate that the 
Senate’s intention also is to quickly 
bring the 2002 AUMF repeal for a vote. 
So I look forward to Congress no 
longer taking a backseat on some of 
the most consequential decisions our 
Nation can make. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, the Out of Iraq Caucus, and a cospon-
sor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 256, which 
repeals the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq passed by Congress nearly 
twenty years ago on October 16, 2002 as 
Pub. L. 107–243. 
I extend my thanks and deep appreciation 
to our colleague, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, for her 
tireless and unwavering devotion to repealing 
this misguided AUMF and acknowledging the 
grievous mistake history has shown it to be 
and as many of predicted at the time it would 
be. 
Congress never intended for the 2002 
AUMF to have such broad and extended 
reach. 
Over the last 18 years, we have seen 3 
Presidents use this legislation as a blank 
check to engage in serious military action. 
The 2002 AUMF is an outdated piece of 
legislation and repealing it will not affect any 
current military operations. 
Moreover, the 2002 AUMF is unnecessary 
because everything the 2002 AUMF covers is 
already fully covered under the 2001 9/11 
AUMF, except for attacks against Iran. 
Congress passed the 2002 AUMF to ad-
dress the perceived threat posed by the re-
gime of Saddam Hussein and the AUMF per-
mitted the President to use the armed forces 
as ‘‘necessary and appropriate’’ to ‘‘defend 
U.S. national security against the continuing 
threat posed by Iraq’’ and to ‘‘enforce all rel-
evant Security Council resolutions regarding 
Iraq.’’ 
U.S. military deployments and operations 
carried out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF— 
dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom—officially 
concluded in 2011. 
Almost 18 years after the resolution’s pas-
sage, the United States recognizes the sov-
ereignty of Iraq and considers Iraq a key ally. 
Under the Constitution, Congress has the 
sole duty to declare war and repealing obso-
lete Authorizations for Use of Military Force 
(AUMFs) is essential for Congress to fulfill its 
constitutional responsibilities. 
Leaving the 2002 AUMF in place increases 
the likelihood that future presidents will use it 
as a basis to start a new war, or expand a 
current one, without Congress’s explicit au-
thorization. 
In July 2019, the House adopted a Lee 
amendment to NDAA virtually identical to H.R. 
256, To Repeal the AUMF Against Iraq Reso-
lution of 2002, by a bipartisan vote of 242 to 
180. 
The overly broad 2002 AUMF represents 
deterioration of Congressional oversight. 
As our brave service members are deployed 
around the world in combat zones, Congress 
is missing in action. 
Congress must repeal the 2002 AUMF im-
mediately to fulfill its constitutional obligation 
to provide oversight and consent on matters of 
war and peace. 
As provided under the War Powers Resolu-
tion of 1973, absent a Congressional declara-
tion of war or authorization for the use of mili-
tary force, the President as Commander-in- 
Chief has constitutional power to engage the 
U.S. armed forces in hostilities only in the 
case of a national emergency created by an 
attack upon the United States, its territories or 
possessions, or its armed forces. 
Mr. Speaker, since the objectives which led 
Congress to pass the 2002 Authorization to 
Use 
Military 
Force 
(AUMF) 
have 
been 
achieved, I believe the authorization to use 
that military force expired automatically. 
That is why thirteen years ago, on October 
31, 2007, I introduced H.R. 4020, the ‘‘Military 
Success in Iraq Commemoration Act of 2007,’’ 
which acknowledged and affirmed that the two 
objectives of the 2002 AUMF—(1) to defend 
the national security of the United States and 
(2) to enforce all relevant United Nations Se-
curity Council resolutions regarding Iraq—had 
in fact been achieved and called upon the 
President to issue a proclamation calling upon 
the people of the United States to observe a 
national day of celebration commemorating 
military success in Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, where a Congressional author-
ization to use military force has expired, the 
President must obtain a new authorization to 
continue the use of force. 
As a co-equal branch of government, it is 
Congress’s right and responsibility to be fully 
consulted regarding any potential plans to ex-
pand military operations in the region, to as-
sess whether such action is in the national se-
curity interest of the United States and our al-
lies, and to withhold or grant authorization for 
the use of military force based on this assess-
ment. 
As we have learned from the painful and bit-
ter experience of the past 18 years, at the ini-
tiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood 
and treasure of U.S. military interventions 
abroad are often underestimated and the ben-
efits overstated. 
More than 6,800 American service members 
gave the last full measure of devotion to their 
country on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq, 
with hundreds of thousands more returning 
with physical, emotional, or psychological 
wounds that may never heal. 
The direct economic cost of the war in the 
Persian Gulf exceeds $1.07 trillion, including 
$773 billion in Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations funds, an increase of $243 billion to the 
Department of Defense base budget, and an 
increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Ad-
ministration budget to address the human 
costs of the military involvement in Iraq. 
We should not repeat the mistakes of the 
past and the legislation before us is directly 
aligned with the will of the American people. 
I commend my colleague, Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE for introducing this legislation 
and urge all Members to vote for H.R. 256 
and repeal the misguided and certainly out-
dated 2002 Authorization For Use of Military 
Force in Iraq. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 256, legislation to re-
peal the Authorization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (‘‘2002 
AUMF’’). 
This authorization has outlived its useful-
ness, if it ever had one. My position on the 
Iraq war has been clear: I opposed the occu-
pation of Iraq and the damage it unleashed. 
We were wise to exit this quagmire while re-
taining the ability to address any legitimate se-
curity threats emanating from this region. 
But we left the 2002 AUMF in place, which 
was a mistake. First the Obama Administration 
and now the Biden Administration have made 
clear it is no longer needed. As noted by the 
Biden Administration, ‘‘repeal of the 2002 
AUMF would likely have minimal impact on 
current military operations.’’ 
Additionally, I share concerns that failure to 
repeal the 2002 AUMF will allow it to continue 
to be misused to legitimize U.S. military ac-
tions that were never contemplated when it 
was passed, including in areas far outside of 
Iraq. 
It’s time that Congress begins to reclaim its 
war powers. Repealing this outdated 2002 
AUMF will also allow our country to refocus 
our military strategies and efforts towards de-
fending against legitimate national security 
threats facing our country. We will never stop 
open ended war if we never reconsider the 
open-ended authorizations that are feeding 
them. The Constitution is clear about Con-
gress’ authority. These are difficult decisions 
but every time we punt on reasserting our au-
thority regarding sending our men and women 
in uniform to war, we weaken our institution 
and our democracy. 
Today’s vote marks the fourth time in the 
past three years that the House has passed 
similar legislation in a bipartisan fashion. To-
day’s action hopefully marks the last time we 
do so and that we will finally see this legisla-
tion enacted into law. 
I support H.R. 256 and the termination of 
the Authorization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this measure.

MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have a

The Clerk will report the motion to

The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McCaul moves to recommit the bill, 
H.R. 256, to the Committee on Foreign Af-

list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow. 
In addition, we will consider: 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, which 
would make it easier for those who 
have suffered age discrimination in the 
workplace to file a complaint and seek 
redress; 
H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal 
Credit Enforcement and Investment 
Act, which would ensure that the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau 
keep statistics on credit reporting for 
LGBTQ-owned businesses in the same 
way as it does for women- and minor-
ity-owned companies and small busi-
nesses; and 
H.R. 239, Equal Access to Contracep-
tion for Veterans Act, which would 
allow women receiving healthcare serv-
ices from the VA system to access 
basic contraceptive care without pay-
ing copays similar to coverage pro-
vided under the Affordable Care Act. 
We will consider three resolutions of 
disapproval to reverse regulatory ac-
tions made under the prior administra-
tion, which have all been passed by the 
Senate: 
S.J. Res. 13 would reverse the Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commis-
sion’s rule that had obscured informa-
tion about the factual and legal basis 
the Commission used to make deter-
minations on discriminatory practices; 
S.J. Res. 14 would overturn the prior 
administration’s Environmental Pro-
tection Agency rule that removed pro-
tections from dangerous methane emis-
sions that exacerbate the climate cri-
sis; and 
S.J. Res. 15 would overturn a rule by 
the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency and allow States once again 
to regulate these lenders and protect 
consumers in order to rein in predatory 
lenders and rent-a-bank schemes. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from South Caro-
lina for walking us through those. Of 
course, I would first like to, as we note 
that the majority leader is not here, 
wish Mr. HOYER a speedy recovery. I 
got to speak with him yesterday, and 
he is doing better and appreciates the 
prayers and thoughts from our col-
leagues. 
And I told him: You don’t have to 
rush back. You want to make sure you 
get better before you come back. 
And I know from experience to take 
the time and get better. And I offered, 
by the way, use of my physical thera-
pist, and maybe he and I will do some 
joint physical therapy when he returns. 
But he was in good spirits and is look-
ing forward to coming back. I know the 
gentleman from South Carolina shares 
that as well. 
MR. CLYBURN. Absolutely. 
Mr. SCALISE. I am sure the gen-
tleman from Maryland is watching 
right now as he is recovering, but I 
said, we are used to sparring and hav-
ing some fun conversations back and 
forth through the Select Subcommittee 
on the Coronavirus, but we also look 
forward to seeing him back in the mid-
dle of this fray soon, too. 
If I may, I did want to ask. There 
were a couple of bills that deal with 
the origin of the coronavirus, and I 
know we have been having those con-
versations about trying to get a deeper 
investigation into the origin of the 
coronavirus. But the Senate had passed 
over a few weeks ago a bill, S. 1867, 
that came out of the Senate unani-
mously back in May, which requires 
the Director of National Intelligence to 
declassify information that relates to 
the origin of COVID–19. 
I am not sure if this is a bill that you 
all were looking at bringing up, but we 
wanted to just ask if we could have S. 
1867 brought to the House floor. It was 
a bill that passed unanimously out of 
the Senate, which does indicate that 
there was strong interest on both sides 
to get that information declassified so 
we can get more information about the 
origin of COVID for all of our Members 
to be able to see, not just those Mem-
bers that have access to that informa-
tion. 
I am not sure, again, if the gen-
tleman was looking at that, but if that 
is something you all could look at, I 
think it would be well received by both 
sides, and then would help us quickly 
get that information available for all 
to see. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. You and I have been 
having this discussion for quite a while 
with our select subcommittee activi-
ties. I have not seen the legislation 
that you make reference to, but I am 
sure that the majority leader has. And, 
like you, I am looking forward to his 
speedy recovery so he can get back into 
this spot. I am a little more familiar 
with sparring with you in our select 
subcommittee than on this floor. 
But having said that, I think you are 
aware that the Biden administration 
has already directed the United States 
intelligence community to examine 
this issue, calling on the intelligence 
community to redouble their efforts to 
report their findings by August 24 and 
to keep Congress fully apprised of their 
work. 
We have confidence in their ability 
to conduct a robust evidence-based in-
quiry into the origin of the coronavirus 
and will not allow House Republicans 
to irresponsibly hijack this issue for 
partisan purposes. We want to see this 
thing happen, and you and I have had 
this discussion. And because they have 
got until August 24—that is, what, 3 
months from now, or less—I think we 
will be in a good place to let the Intel-
ligence Committee do its work. 
Mr. SCALISE. There is an old adage: 
‘‘Why put off tomorrow what you can 
do today?’’ 
There is unanimous support for S. 
1867 to not wait until August. And, in 
fact, it was May when Senators—all 
Republicans and all Democrat Sen-
ators—recognized that this is some-
thing we should do and we should do 
now, and this would get more informa-
tion out to the public, as well as to our 
Members. 
I would also ask if the majority 
would look at H. Res. 90, which is a res-
olution that supports the international 
investigation into the origin of COVID– 
19. 
There are many countries. We have 
heard a lot of European countries have 
expressed interest in having an inter-
national commission to look into this. 
I don’t know why the United States 
would be reluctant to be a part of that 
investigation. 
But, again, in light of all of the new 
information that has come out, some 
emails recently since our committee 
has met, show more and more that 
there is a high likelihood that COVID– 
19 started in the Wuhan lab. Whether it 
was intentional or not, there is strong 
evidence pointing to the fact that it 
likely started there. 
We have not had a single hearing, not 
any of the standing committees, and 
here we have a committee that, by its 
name, the Select Subcommittee on the 
Coronavirus was established for the 
purpose of investigating COVID–19, all 
elements of it, not just what is hap-
pening here in America. 
We just recognized over 600,000 deaths 
from COVID–19 on the steps of the Cap-
itol just a few days ago. So, clearly, it 
has hit our country hard, but it has hit 
the whole world hard. Millions of peo-
ple have died. And now there is real 
evidence that has come out, including 
from some of our own scientists here in 
America, that they may have been 
aware over a year ago that COVID–19 
originated in the lab as opposed to 
what the original projections were that 
it was a bat-to-human transmission. 
Now there is a lot of evidence pointing 
to the opposite of that. 
In fact, many of us were calling for 
that investigation over a year ago, and 
some were called conspiracy theorists, 
yet now the hard scientific data shows 
that it may have been, in fact, started 
in that lab. 
Why are we not having those hear-
ings now in our committee, other com-
mittees, again, not months from now? 
But if China knew of this, there may 
not be scientists that we can get access 
to, but we have American scientists 
who were in communication with those 
scientists. Whether it is directly or in-
directly, there may have been taxpayer 
funds that were involved in that. We 
should be trying to find that out now. 
And China may be trying to cover some 
of that up. 
The quicker we can get those hear-
ings and those investigations, the more 
we can find out while it is still possible 
to find it out. I think it would help a 
lot of us to understand what really 
happened, what went wrong. 
Because if it was started in that lab, 
this would be a disaster dramatically 
greater than Chernobyl in terms of 
devastation to the world, loss of human 
life. We should all want to be finding

June 17, 2021 
out. There were a lot of investigations 
into Chernobyl. This is dramatically 
worse than Chernobyl. And if it was 
self-made, that is something we should 
be investigating now. I am not sure 
why there is a reluctance to do it. 
But I would ask the gentleman, if I 
could just reiterate, I know we sent a 
letter—over 
200 
of 
our 
colleagues 
signed on—asking that we investigate 
it, all the committees of jurisdiction, 
including ours. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to assure the gentleman that I 
am as anxious to know exactly what 
happened as he is. And the American 
people want to know exactly what hap-
pened. The fact of the matter is, 
though, we have several committees 
that are investigating, including the 
House Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology have indicated that 
they intend to look into the matter. 
Now, like you, I am from the South, 
and you can get too many cooks in the 
kitchen. And I am fully aware that to 
have a plethora of committees stum-
bling over each other trying to get to 
the bottom of this will serve no useful 
purpose. 
So I want to see things done here as 
close to regular order as we possibly 
can have them done, and to let the 
committees of jurisdiction conduct 
their investigation, this administra-
tion working through its intelligence 
department doing the investigations, 
and I am sure they will come up with 
the kind of information that would do 
us as citizens and as Members of this 
great body justice. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, we 
will continue to press for that inves-
tigation. 
And, you know, I am from New Orle-
ans, and I know what it is like to have 
cooks in the kitchen, but I also know 
how important it is to have a lot of 
eyes looking at the same thing. And 
the more eyes looking into something 
where there is mystery, where there is 
uncertainty, where there is specula-
tion, I think the more people looking 
at this, the better. 
Again, our committee is uniquely set 
up. There are other committees that 
are set up to look at different aspects 
of it. We should all be looking at it be-
cause the more questions we ask—it 
seems like right now more questions 
are raised. We need to get answers to 
those questions, and we get those an-
swers by having that oversight hear-
ing. We don’t want some kind of So-
viet-style coverup. We want to be look-
ing at those questions and having peo-
ple brought in. 
There are American scientists, some 
people who work for this United States 
Government, who could help us answer 
those questions, and they haven’t been 
brought forward. We can compel them 
to come forward, especially in light of 
these emails that have come out re-
cently, which show that some of those 
scientists were aware over a year ago 
that it may have started in the lab. 
b 1145 
That was not shared with us in pre-
vious hearings. I think a lot of our 
Members on both sides would like to 
find that information out as much as 
we can. And the more we are asking 
questions, the more I think we will get 
answers that everybody in the country 
and around the world wants to know. 
So, we will continue to press for that. 
I also want to ask about the appro-
priations process. I understand the 
Committee on Appropriations is start-
ing to do some work to start bringing 
up the bills in committee so that we 
can, hopefully, have an appropriations 
process move forward. We would be 
strongly encouraging a bipartisan ap-
propriations process but also an open 
appropriations process. 
So, as we look to the floor schedule, 
we are hearing that maybe in July 
some of these bills would come to the 
floor. As the gentleman knows, when 
we bring appropriations bills to the 
floor, whether it is a fully open process 
or even a modified process, you typi-
cally have well over 100 amendments 
that come to the floor on these appro-
priations bills. 
Does the gentleman anticipate that 
we would start, around July, seeing 
some of those bills come to the floor? 
And will we have that ability on the 
floor to have those kinds of amend-
ments brought forward in a process 
that we have seen in the past? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The Committee on Appropriations 
has announced that it will start its 
process next week with four sub-
committee markups. Over the next 2 
weeks, and then the week of July 12, 
the committee will complete sub-
committee and full committee mark-
ups on all 12 of the annual appropria-
tions bills. 
We plan to consider the bills on the 
floor the final 2 weeks of July, when we 
are in session. That will be the week of 
July 19 and July 26. 
Now, I suspect that we will be close 
to what the gentleman just indicated 
he would like to see with the schedule. 
I am certain that the Committee on 
Appropriations will do everything it 
possibly can to keep that schedule so 
that we will complete all of our work 
before the August break. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and we look forward to 
that robust process through both com-
mittee and, ultimately, on the floor. 
The last point, I wanted to ask about 
deals with infrastructure. We are see-
ing a lot of different groups both in the 
House and Senate that are working on 
various infrastructure plans. I know we 
had Members on our side, Ranking 
Member GRAVES and others, who rolled 
out a plan recently that covers tradi-
tional infrastructure, which would be 
roads and bridges—even broadband, wa-
terways—paid for along the way, not 
with tax increases but with responsible 
budgeting. 
I wanted to ask because we are hear-
ing different reports on what may or 
may not come to the House floor. 
Budget reconciliation, possibly, and 
tax increases, unfortunately, are still 
being floated out there, which is dif-
ferent from what we are hearing right 
now with the bipartisan Senate plan. 
Can the gentleman shed light on 
what is anticipated on the floor, 
whether it would be a budget reconcili-
ation bill in the weeks or months 
ahead or maybe a bipartisan plan, 
which we would surely encourage, lay-
ing out some ideas of infrastructure 
that would be bipartisan that we would 
support? 
Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman could 
answer that, I would be happy to yield. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I think the 
gentleman is aware that I am very anx-
ious about doing things in a bipartisan 
way when that can be achieved. 
Now, the majority leader has an-
nounced that during the week of June 
28, the House will take up the INVEST 
in America Act, a 5-year surface trans-
portation reauthorization bill that was 
approved by the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure by a bi-
partisan vote. 
I think the gentleman is aware of the 
pretty long session, all-night session, 
that both parties in that committee 
undertook. I think that they have pro-
duced a product that will make these 
key investments in smart, safe, sus-
tainable, and resilient transportation 
infrastructure that is needed by the 
American people to move goods and 
services throughout our country effi-
ciently, effectively, and equitably. I 
could not go through this colloquy 
with the gentleman and not invoke 
those three words that he is so familiar 
with. 
Now, at the same time, we must re-
member that our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture is comprised of far more than 
roads and bridges. I often talk about 
the advent of the internet. I could re-
member when it first came on the 
scene, everybody referred to the inter-
net 
as 
the 
‘‘information 
super-
highway.’’ I have always advocated 
that it is time for us to start treating 
the information highway the same way 
we treat the interstate highways. 
So, I agree with the gentleman that 
we should move with an infrastructure 
bill, but I want him to know that I 
think it is important that the Acces-
sible, Affordable Internet for All Act is 
a part of that. 
I know this debate has been going on 
as to whether or not we ought to move 
on a bipartisan bill that focuses on tra-
ditional infrastructure. For anything 
to be traditional, it has to be in our 
past, but I think it is time for us to be 
looking to the future when we talk 
about infrastructure and to have an in-
frastructure bill come through this 
body that focuses on the future of 
healthcare, which cannot be efficient, 
effective, 
or 
equitable 
without 
broadband.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2913 
June 17, 2021 
Online learning is a must for our 
children. We know COVID–19, accord-
ing to all the experts, may not be the 
last time that we are faced with such a 
pandemic. There are some predicting 
that there could come another, maybe 
not in my lifetime but maybe in yours. 
We must be prepared. 
So, I am hopeful that this infrastruc-
ture bill that we move through this 
body will not just be traditional but 
will be looking to the future so we can 
have the kind of legislation that will 
prepare our children and grandchildren 
for a world that we hope they will be 
competitive in. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. Hopefully, we can have 
that debate and work together to 
achieve that vision for the future as we 
are dealing with the problems of today 
and our infrastructure needs for today, 
but also do it in a fiscally responsible 
way. I think that is what the two sides, 
especially in the Senate, are looking 
at. 
I still haven’t gotten an indication, 
specifically, as it deals with some kind 
of reconciliation bill that may or may 
not come to the floor. Hopefully, it is 
not some attempt to raise taxes and do 
things that would undermine our econ-
omy, our competitiveness, and our 
ability to create more opportunities for 
people to achieve the American Dream 
by entering into the workforce and ul-
timately moving their way up and hav-
ing their own opportunities as well, 
which would be undermined with high-
er taxes. 
If that part of the equation gets 
brought in, clearly, that changes the 
dynamic. But, hopefully, we stick to 
the traditional infrastructure needs 
that you and I would both agree need 
to be met. Hopefully, we can find a 
path to get there together. That is 
what we will be working toward in the 
week ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has 
nothing else, I am prepared to yield 
back. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
have anything else. I thank the gen-
tleman for allowing me to stand in 
here today. 
I say to him that I would hope that 
as we go forward with this discussion, 
we will look at this whole issue as the 
title of the bill indicates: Invest in 
America. When we make investments, 
financial investments, the money may 
leave our coffers, but it comes back 
sometimes tenfold. 
So there is a big difference between 
raising taxes and making investments. 
Mr. SCALISE. Hopefully, we can 
keep that difference in mind. 
I appreciate the gentleman filling in, 
and we will see the gentleman from 
Maryland back soon enough and maybe 
even moving a little faster than before. 
I am not going to challenge him to a 
race because he would defeat me in 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
South Carolina, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
RECOMMITTING ON JUNETEENTH 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, on June 19, 1865, 
freedom finally came for the last 
enslaved African Americans in the 
United States when Union soldiers ar-
rived in Galveston, Texas, more than 2 
years after President Lincoln issued 
the Emancipation Proclamation. 
Today, 156 years later, President 
Biden will be signing a law to make 
Juneteenth a new Federal holiday. It is 
a cause for celebration. It should also 
serve as an occasion for learning and 
for this country to reflect on our his-
tory and recommit to doing the vital 
work to ensure that the lasting effects 
of slavery, bigotry, and racism are re-
placed with hope, dignity, and equality 
for all. 
We can start with the Senate passing 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act, legislation to reform policing and 
address systemic racism and bias with-
in law enforcement, and finally making 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act a 
law, passing it. 
Today, we celebrate this historic des-
ignation of Juneteenth as a Federal 
holiday. Tomorrow, we get back to 
work. 
f 
BIDEN INFLATION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the hid-
den tax that is plaguing hardworking 
Americans. This hidden tax is infla-
tion. 
Under President Biden, we have seen 
the largest spike in 13 years, with con-
sumer prices surging 5 percent in May. 
Core inflation rose at its fastest pace 
since 1992. 
American families are being forced to 
pay more for the products that they 
need. Gasoline is 56.2 percent more ex-
pensive today than 12 months ago. 
Transportation services have increased 
11.2 percent. Together, food and energy 
prices have increased 3.8 percent. Even 
used cars and truck prices have in-
creased 29.7 percent. 
Yet, Democrats rammed through a 
trillion-dollar package that is crushing 
small businesses and hurting hard-
working 
American 
families 
by 
incentivizing Americans to stay at 
home and not get back to work. We are 
currently down 7.6 million jobs from 
our pre-pandemic levels. Our inflation 
is rising because of President Biden’s 
far-left tax-and-spend proposals. 
Americans cannot afford the Biden 
inflation tax. We know wasteful gov-
ernment spending will not solve this 
crisis, no matter how many times 
President Biden and the Democrats 
propose it. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ANITA 
EHLERS 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Anita Ehlers, a con-
stituent member of the Barrington, Il-
linois, community I represent and, 
more importantly, a friend. 
I never knew Anita when she didn’t 
have cancer. But for a long time, I 
didn’t know that she did. She just 
never let it define who she was. 
I knew her as a wonderfully kind, 
hardworking woman who was com-
mitted to making the world a better 
place. 
Our Speaker often reminds us: ‘‘We 
don’t agonize. We organize.’’ Every 
time she says it, I see Anita’s face in 
my head. 
I never saw her feel sorry for herself. 
Every time I was with her, it seemed 
like all the thoughts in her head were 
on how to make the world a little bet-
ter for everybody else: her husband, 
Gregg; her daughters, Julia and Lind-
say; her friends and neighbors; me and 
all the folks she was motivating. 
As a women’s marcher, a climate pro-
tector, an ally for the LBGT commu-
nity, 
a 
universal 
health 
coverage 
champion, a union member, a teacher, 
and a lung cancer support advocate, 
she never agonized. She organized. 
The world, and our district, is a sad-
der place without her. But I take inspi-
ration because she always made our 
community a better place. 
May we all find the strength to fol-
low her example, to make the world 
around us a little easier for everybody 
else, no matter the adversity that we 
may personally face.

1200 
PREPARATIONS TO EVACUATE 
AFGHAN INTERPRETERS 
(Mr. MEIJER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address the dire situation of 
our interpreters in Afghanistan, where 
we are over halfway through our 
planned withdrawal. Meanwhile, al-
most 20,000 Afghans who worked with 
U.S. forces are anxiously awaiting spe-
cial immigrant visa approval, a process 
that can take years. Making matters 
worse, our Kabul Embassy suspended 
visa operations last week due to a 
surge in COVID cases. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden must 
immediately 
start 
preparations 
to 
evacuate those Afghans to Guam to 
safely await visa approval. My col-
leagues and I on the Honoring our 
Promises Working Group urged the ad-
ministration to do so 2 weeks ago, but 
we have yet to hear back. This is unac-
ceptable. 
President Biden ended the remain in 
Mexico for economic migrants but in-
sists on a remain in Afghanistan policy

the Taliban are hunting them down. 
Dozens have already been killed while

We cannot abandon our Afghan allies 
to die. We must get them to Guam.

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE 
AND CLEAN ENERGY 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, we cannot 
unravel infrastructure from climate. 
As we consider bold new investments in 
America’s infrastructure, our choices 
will shape our climate future for better 
or worse. 
Failing to address climate pollution 
and clean energy in our infrastructure 
work will force future generations of 
Americans to cover a blank check. And 
we are already passing on grave and 
growing costs for our past failures to 
act. 
But let me put this another way: 
seizing opportunities to tackle climate 
change in our infrastructure work will 
help us build legislation that makes 
America cleaner, safer, and more com-
petitive as a Nation. It will save count-
less lives and create millions of good 
American jobs. 
If we make climate a priority, our 
workers will miss fewer days on the 
job, and our kids will miss fewer days 
at school. Our local budgets will suffer 
less strain. Our infrastructure dollars 
will go farther. The things we build 
will last longer. 
Climate is a growing threat that de-
mands urgent, bold action. And doing 
nothing about it is doing something, it 
is condemning the United States to be-
come a weaker, sicker, and poorer Na-
tion. This is our path to choose. Do we 
allow America to further decline or 
choose a more sustainable, prosperous, 
and just future? To me, the decision is 
clear: Let’s move forward.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, this 
week I received a letter and these 
photos, in fact, more photos than just 
this, from a constituent. The photos 
were taken on his ranch at 5 a.m. ear-
lier this week from a game camera 
about 15 miles north of the border. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from Russell Johnson dated 
June 13, 2021, and I would like to read 
a few excerpts from the letter. 
‘‘When President Biden signed the 
proclamation ending border wall con-
struction, we saw a dramatic increase 
in illegal foot traffic through our 
ranch.’’ 
I can no longer allow my children to play 
outside unless an adult is with them to mon-
itor the areas around them. People who have 
dropped out of groups crossing have stopped 
at my house wanting to use the phone, WiFi, 
and call their smuggler. This is very con-
cerning, as often my wife is at home alone 
with our children, and I am hours away 
working on the ranch. These people are des-
perate. And it is only a matter of time before 
someone gets hurt. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the border in New 
Mexico is not like the other borders in 
cities around El Paso or the ports of 
entry, here there is a huge difference. 
JUNE 13, 2021. 
REPRESENTATIVE
HERRELL, My name is 
Russell Johnson. I am a fourth-generation 
cattle rancher in southern Luna County. I 
ranch along side my wife, two children, my 
father, and my mother. Our ranch borders 
the international boundary with Mexico for 
a little over 8 miles. My family has ranched 
on this same piece of land since 1918. What 
we are experiencing on the border today is 
not only a risk to my family, but our state 
and this nation. 
When President Biden signed the procla-
mation ending border wall construction, we 
saw a dramatic increase in illegal foot traffic 
through our ranch. There now exists a gap in 
the wall that separates the United States 
from Mexico on our ranch. It is approxi-
mately 3/4-mile wide along with a border 
monument access gate that was not installed 
leaving a gap about 12 feet wide. Not only did 
President Biden’s proclamation end the con-
struction of the physical barrier, but it also 
stopped all other infrastructure and tech-
nology that was to go with it. Improved ac-
cess roads for Border Patrol, lighting, sensor 
technology and camera systems were all part 
of the project that was abruptly ended. The 
situation at the border has progressively 
worsened because of this decision. Talking 
with local Border Patrol Agents, group size 
in our area has gone from four to six people 
in a group, to now being upwards of twenty. 
This is all crossing and passing through not 
only my property, but our homes and busi-
ness. 
I can no longer allow my children to play 
outside unless an adult is with them to mon-
itor the areas around them. People who have 
dropped out of groups crossing have stopped 
at my house wanting to use the phone or 
have access to my Wi-Fi to call their smug-
gler. This is very concerning as often my 
wife is at home alone with our children and 
I am hours away working on the ranch. 
These people are desperate. It’s only a mat-
ter of time before our home is broken into. 
The increase in traffic is also affecting our 
business. Much of southern New Mexico is 
suffering a D4 drought. We are having to sup-
plement our cattle to get to the monsoon 
season. This hardship is being compounded 
by the people crossing the border illegally. 
Currently, we have decent natural grasses in 
the pasture bordering Mexico. Our cattle are 
not utilizing this rangeland properly because 
they are constantly getting spooked by the 
people crossing. This is pushing them into 
drier areas with not enough suitable feed for 
them to consume. The cattle are also suscep-
tible to contracting stress induced illnesses 
like Pasteurella Pneumonia from constantly 
being run off. We have experienced this be-
fore under similar border conditions. If not 
treated quickly, cattle can die within 48 
hours. We are experiencing this not only on 
parts of the ranch that border Mexico, but 
further north as well. 
Our day-to-day operations have been nega-
tively impacted. We now try to work in pairs 
at a minimum. With no cellphone service in 
our area, it is safer to work with someone 
with you, so you have somebody to watch 
your back. This slows our work progress 
down and increases the length of time it 
takes to get tasks down. 
On June 4, 2021, my father and I encoun-
tered four groups of illegal immigrants on 
our ranch totaling well over 30 individuals. 
Border Patrol was able to apprehend all four 
groups, but they told me something that I 
found very troubling. They said that there 
were only eight agents in the field that 
evening. Deming Border Patrol Station is re-
sponsible for the area we live in. The sta-
tion’s area of responsibility includes well 
over 60 miles of border. Eight agents were ex-
pected to cover all of that during their shift. 
This does not make for a very secure border. 
Encountering groups crossing and a lack of 
manpower in the field is becoming the norm. 
The Patrol Agent in Charge at the Deming 
Border Patrol Station told us that they are 
averaging 650 apprehensions a week. These 
are apprehensions, they do not include the 
people that are successfully making their il-
legal entry. 
It is important to note that we do not have 
unaccompanied minors or family groups 
crossing through our area. They are all 
young, adult males in good physical shape. 
All the people I have encountered are wear-
ing full camouflage, to include face cov-
erings and carpet or sponge booties on their 
feet. These people are not turning them-
selves in, they do not want to be caught. 
Unfortunately, this is not the first time we 
have experienced issues regarding the bor-
der. What differs this time from others is 
that our government is not trying to do any-
thing to resolve the issue. I feel like as a cit-
izen of this country, I do not matter in the 
eyes of our government. The State of Texas 
has declared a state of emergency in many if 
not all its counties that border Mexico. 
Texas is doing this because the Federal Gov-
ernment is not addressing the issue. Enough 
pressure will be put on the Texas border that 
New Mexico will see an even larger increase 
in illegal traffic as it will be pushed west. 
This bothers me greatly. 
I am writing you today to make you aware 
of the situation on the border in our area and 
to ask for help. Border Patrol manpower is 
strained, and our local law enforcement is 
stretched thin. Ideally, the border wall and 
all infrastructure and technology need com-
pleted. In the meantime, we desperately need 
more boots on the ground to help with this 
surge in illegal traffic. We also need better 
cellphone coverage in these remote areas. 
Not being able to call for law enforcement or 
emergency service is a huge safety concern. 
Last, but certainly not least, we need help 
getting this administration to address the 
border crisis. Thank you for your attention 
to these matters. 
Respectfully, 
RUSSELL JOHNSON.

HONORING WILLIAM ALLEN 
PULLUM 
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life of William Allen 
Pullum. 
Navarre is a community in my dis-
trict in Florida that is one of the fast-
est growing. It is vibrant, full of 
warfighters, workers, and lovely peo-
ple. Bill Pullum is the father of 
Navarre. 
He was born in 1947 and lived most of 
his life in this community. He joined 
the Army in 1967 as an Army helicopter

Flying Crosses in Vietnam before being 
honorably discharged in 1970. 
He was involved in every aspect of 
life from real estate to business devel-
opment, 
chambers 
of 
commerce, 
Kiwanis Clubs. There was hardly a 
cause in Navarre that Bill Pullum and 
his family did not support. 
He was dedicated as a family mem-
ber, a husband, a father, and was in-
strumental in mission work in Hon-
duras throughout his life. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the late Bill Pullum for his life of

RECOGNIZING DICKINSON HIGH 
SCHOOL SOFTBALL CHAMPIONS 
(Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, on 
Saturday, June 5, the Dickinson High 
School girls softball team capped off an 
extraordinary season by winning the 
North Dakota Class A State Champion-
ship. 
Dickinson had 13 hits, and Mataya 
Mortensen’s dominant pitching per-
formance led to the team’s first-ever 
State title. Dickinson’s 10–0 win was 
their 30th in 33 games. Mortensen sur-
rendered only two hits in the shutout. 
And senior Paige Balliet ended the 
game with a walk-off double to trigger 
the 10-run rule. 
Dickinson finished the season with 30 
and 3. They had 487 hits, 110 doubles, 19 
triples, and 51 home runs. Their team 
batting average was .464, and they 
averaged 14.5 runs a game, contrasted 
with a team ERA of 1.42 and 250 strike-
outs in 196 innings. 
Both Taya Hopfauf and Jenna Decker 
were named to the all-State team, and 
Coach Amanda Mickey was named 
coach of the year. 
Congratulations to the entire team 
on a great year, especially Paige 
Balliet and Madison McChesney.

HONORING DR. STEPHEN 
PRESCOTT 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and leg-
acy of the late Dr. Stephen Prescott, 
former Oklahoma Medical Research 
Foundation president. 
Dr. Prescott served OMRF with out-
standing leadership for 15 years, build-
ing the institution into what it is 
today. He dedicated his life to a sci-
entific career, immersed in medical re-
search, and loved traveling the world, 
often in conjunction with his profes-
sional commitments. But what he 
loved more than anything was his wife 
of 52 years, Susan, his two children and 
grandchildren. 
During his time at OMRF, Dr. Pres-
cott oversaw the largest campus expan-
sion in the foundation’s history, mak-
ing 
the 
facility 
one 
of 
only 
11 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence 
in the United States. 
Throughout his career, he received 
numerous awards, authored more than 
250 scientific articles, served on the 
NIH, and even founded a biotech com-
pany. As a direct result of his many 
years of hard work and accomplish-
ments, he was inducted into the Okla-
homa Hall of Fame in 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, Dr. Prescott made an 
immense impact on OMRF, and as a re-
sult, the lives of thousands of Oklaho-
mans. As a leading facility for health 
research, I want Americans to know 
how instrumental his role was in cre-
ating a facility where researchers are 
working hard to understand and de-
velop new treatments for diseases like 
cancer, heart disease, and aging. 
I am honored to recognize Dr. Pres-
cott, and I am grateful for the profound 
impact he has had on my district and 
far beyond. He will be greatly missed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAYMOND 
TRUJILLO 
(Mr. DONALDS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Raymond 
Trujillo, 
a 
patriotic 
American, 
a 
United States marine, and a dutiful of-
ficer in Collier County, Florida. He 
tragically passed away in May at the 
age of 56 years old. 
Raymond dedicated his life to giving 
back through service. He joined the 
United States Marine Corps as a teen-
ager. Devoted to the Marine Corps 
creed, semper fidelis, Raymond spent 17 
years in the military proudly serving 
our Nation. 
Upon his exit from the military, Ray-
mond continued his service in his com-
munity by becoming a police officer 
with the Collier County Sheriff’s office, 
to which he would serve the Collier 
County community for more than 20 
years. 
Alongside his brothers and sisters in 
blue, Raymond protected the Collier 
County community for more than 20 
years. For years, he worked in the 
Youth Relations Bureau helping to 
mold and shape the children of today 
and the future leaders of tomorrow. 
Growing up in California, Raymond 
was a lifelong Oakland Raiders fan and 
loved the game of football, so much so 
he spent his spare time coaching youth 
football. 
In a moment of history where police 
officers are vilified, hated, and looked 
down upon, Raymond Trujillo wore the 
badge with honor, dignity, and respect. 
Raymond was a proud father to three 
sons, Raymond III, Alexander, and 
Jason, and a loving grandfather of 
three, who were his pride and joy. 
My prayers are with his fellow ma-
rines, his brothers and sisters in blue, 
and his family. 
As the Representative of Florida’s 
19th Congressional District, it is an 
honor to stand here today celebrating 
the life of an American patriot who 
dedicated his life to a simple, yet so 
often forgotten creed: Service above 
Self.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF OTTO 
WARMBIER 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Otto 
Frederick Warmbier as we approach 
the fourth anniversary of his tragic 
death on June 19, 2017. 
Otto was a kind and studious young 
man, raised in Ohio, was salutatorian 
of his high school and attended the 
University of Virginia. At the age of 22, 
he was imprisoned and tortured by the 
North 
Korean 
regime 
following 
a 
school tour in 2015 and died a few days 
after he was released. 
Mr. Warmbier experienced what no 
American or human being should ever 
have to go through. The United States 
will not back down from holding the 
North Korean regime accountable for 
human rights abuses. 
As one of the first Korean-American 
women to serve in Congress and a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, I will continue to do my 
part to advocate for global human 
rights and hold violators accountable. 
We remember and honor Otto, al-
ways. 
f 
RECENT UPTICK IN INFLATION IN 
OUR COUNTRY 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to note with great alarm the recent up-
tick in inflation in our country. 
Last month, the Consumer Price 
Index rose over 5 percent, which is over 
21⁄2 times the Fed’s target rate for in-
flation in our country. 
The 
price 
of 
lumber—although, 
thankfully, it has declined the last 
week—is still over three times what it 
was just a few months ago. The price of 
fuel is over 50 percent higher. And that 
mirrors the price of many commodities 
from corn to soybeans. 
This is alarming, not just from a 
macroeconomic standpoint, but most 
importantly, from the standpoint of 
the constituents we represent. The 
Members of this Chamber might be 
able to afford to spend 50 percent more 
to fill the tank of their car, but unfor-
tunately, many of the people we rep-
resent cannot. And that burden of in-
flation is an unseen tax on the least ad-
vantaged members of our society, the 
members of the lower class, and the 
working poor. 
Economists tell us that this uptick 
in inflation is directly related to the

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT)

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL SAMUEL LOMBARDO 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to commemorate the life of Lieu-
tenant Colonel Samuel Lombardo. 
Sam and his family legally immi-
grated to the United States from Italy. 
He enlisted to serve in the Army Na-
tional Guard’s 28th Infantry Division 
just 1 month following the start of 
World War II. 
After training, he was deployed to 
Europe where he would serve as pla-
toon leader and executive officer of I 
Company, 394th Infantry Regiment, 
99th Division, and he would always re-
mind constituents in northwest Florida 
that he fought in the Battle of the 
Bulge. 
During this time, Lieutenant Colonel 
Lombardo and his platoon created 
their own makeshift flag out of scraps 
of red and blue cloth. For the white, 
they used German surrender flags. 
They used this as their battle flag in 
victorious campaigns across the Rhine 
and Danube Rivers. 
Following World War II, Lieutenant 
Colonel Lombardo continued his serv-
ice to our country in Korea and Viet-
nam. 
Throughout his service, Lieutenant 
Colonel Lombardo earned the Silver 
Star, the Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ for 
Valor, as well as an Oak Leaf Cluster 
with Meritorious Achievement among 
10 other medals. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the late Lieutenant Colonel Sam-
uel Lombardo. 
I asked Sam how he was able to be so 
healthy after more than 100 years liv-
ing on the planet Earth. He said that 
his secret was red wine and almonds at 
night. I think I will have a little of 
both in his honor this evening. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS). 
RECOGNIZING MUSCATINE HIGH SCHOOL 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a high school 
in my district that was recently recog-
nized for their commitment to student 
success. 
For over 15 years, Iowa has partnered 
with the ACT’s college application 
campaign to increase the number of 
first-generation college students and 
students from low-income households 
in applying for and pursuing higher 
education. 
I am proud to announce that, in 2020, 
176 Iowa schools participated in the 
college application campaign, and all 
together, 504 students completed 1,578 
college applications. Of the 176 schools 
that 
participated, 
Muscatine 
High 
School in my district was awarded the 
2020 School of Excellence Award for 
Iowa from ACT. Muscatine was se-
lected for this great award based on 
their commitment to student success 
and for serving as an exemplary model 
for Iowa’s college application cam-
paign. 
Congratulations to the students and 
faculty at Muscatine for being leaders 
in academic achievement and for serv-
ing as a great role model for student 
success in Iowa and the entire Nation. 
Mr. GOHMERT. It is wonderful to 
hear that about Iowa. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT). 
NEW SPENDING INITIATIVES 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman GOHMERT for yield-
ing to me. 
For anyone who is not particularly 
familiar, we have sort of mechanisms. 
Last night, we were running late, and 
once we hit 10 o’clock, we were shut 
off. And trying to do 21 boards in 8 
minutes, I apologize to those who have 
to try to take our words down. 
But I wanted to just touch on a cou-
ple of things. One really quickly, we 
were just blessed to have Secretary 
Yellen in front of Ways and Means. I 
have tremendous respect for and have 
built a relationship with her when she 
was Federal Reserve Chair. 
I want us all to pay attention to a 
promise that the Secretary and the 
President have made, and that is the 
new spending initiatives will be cov-
ered by the new taxes, the new reve-
nues. I assume that is an honorable 
way to do it. We will fight over what 
the spending priorities are, and none of 
these games where we are going to do 
15 years of tax hikes to cover 10 years 
of spending because, let’s be honest, 
that is a complete fraud on the Amer-
ican people. 
But the best math that is coming out 
from a number of groups right now is 
the tax hikes that are being proposed, 
the revenues, are only going to cover 
maybe, if you are being optimistic, Mr. 
Speaker, on the receipts, 50 percent of 
the new spending. 
Yesterday, I think it is Penn Whar-
ton that put out their model, I guess 
last week, that the capital gains tax 
itself loses $33 billion over the first 10 
years. So, it is not scored to 15 years; 
it is 10. 
But, Mr. Speaker, if you do what is 
called the basis, which is how much is 
subject to the capital gains tax even 
though the perversity of it is that a 
huge portion of that is actually infla-
tion we are going to tax, it would raise, 
in their model, $133 billion. The admin-
istration, the Democrats, have said 
this will be 330. So, they are only hit-
ting about one-third of the revenues 
that have been promised from the cap-
ital gains tax. 
I really want to help the Democrats 
keep their promise that their new $4 
trillion proposed spending will be cov-
ered by their new receipts, their new 
revenues. They have a really inter-
esting math problem. Either they are 
going to have to cut their spending 
substantially in half or dramatically 
raise taxes on the American people. 
We asked Secretary Yellen: Should 
we expect a value-added tax? Is a VAT 
in our future? 
The math is really ugly—we are 
going to talk about that in a second 
here—to cover all these new spending 
initiatives plus just the demographic 
curve that is already about to crush us, 
debtwise. 
The answer was an interesting one. It 
is: Well, that is not part of our current 
proposal. 
For everyone who is interested in tax 
policy—and I accept that maybe some 
of us are a little bit on the geek side— 
I am fascinated with the tax on Medi-
care financing. Keep an ear out because 
the only way I think the left is going 
to get these types of revenues is to ac-
tually go to completely new revenue- 
raising, new tax regimes. 
Let’s talk about what I consider is 
the greatest fragility of our Nation’s 
future. It turns out it is not Republican 
or Democrat policy. It is demographics. 
What is the fastest growing demo-
graphic in the United States? It is get-
ting old. We are graying very, very 
fast. It is baby boomers. 
When you look at this chart—and we 
did this last night, but we did it sort of 
caffeinated, very fast—take the next 30 
years. This is without all the new 
spending that has been proposed this 
year by the new administration. This is 
our baseline, $101 trillion of debt in 30 
years at today’s dollars. This is infla-
tion-adjusted dollars, 67 percent. 
Functionally, $68 trillion of debt is 
just Medicare. Only about $3 trillion is 
the rest of government, so it is Medi-
care, then Social Security. 
If you believe, Mr. Speaker, like I do, 
that we have an absolute moral obliga-
tion to keep our promises to those 
folks who have paid into Social Secu-
rity and Medicare, then what are we 
going to do to keep that promise? 
The reality of it is that this is what 
buries us as a country. It is our demo-
graphics and the promises that are dra-
matically unfunded. Remember, Mr. 
Speaker, it is only maybe 4 years or so 
that the Medicare trust fund—which is 
only part A, which is the hospital por-
tion—that trust fund is gone. 
Part B is actually seeing a doctor. 
Part C is managed care. That has its 
own little, in some ways, financial ben-
efits. And D is drugs. Parts B and D are 
100 percent out of the general fund. 
They don’t have trust funds. 
This is absolutely critical. This will 
drive all government policy. If you are 
someone who wants money for edu-
cation, if you are someone who wants 
money for the environment or our mili-
tary, then the fact of the matter is it is 
Medicare that consumes us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2917 
June 17, 2021 
One of my great frustrations is when 
you look at the math of how much is 
spending, Mr. Speaker, and then the fi-
nancing of that spending, you get a 
sense that, as Republicans, we have 
this bad habit. We will go and say: 
Well, we will balance the budget 
through waste and fraud. 
Democrats will go and say: Well, we 
are going to balance it by nationalizing 
healthcare, Medicare for All. 
None of those are real. We are not 
telling the truth. 
Let’s walk through just a couple of 
things that are in my craw right now. 
This is just one portion of the left’s bill 
called H.R. 3. From a conceptual stand-
point, it is an honest debate of what 
are we going to do about prescription 
drug costs. 
The 
methodology, 
though, 
Mr. 
Speaker, if you actually read the re-
search, in a decade, it is killing people 
and costing more because we are on the 
cusp of a time of miracles. 
This is really important to get our 
heads around. We have all heard about 
this concept of mRNA. We have talked 
about it for 20-plus years. Years ago, I 
used to come to this mike and talk 
about this concept of bio-foundry. 
Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter 
is, we can take a snippet of your DNA 
and a snippet of your cancer, your dis-
ease, or your virus, and it would take 
weeks. And for the CAR-T therapy for 
cancer, it was $350,000 just to get you 
your shot, but it was curing people. We 
just moved up 10 years in technology. 
That is one of the amazing things Op-
eration Warp Speed. It is actually one 
of the few positive things I can say 
that came out of this pandemic is it is 
here. 
Look up Tesla and mRNA, Mr. 
Speaker. You find out that all sorts of 
very disruptive companies are invest-
ing in these little bio-foundries. 
We are on the edge of curing HIV, 
sickle cell anemia. We now have a cure 
for hemophilia. And we are also going 
to cure all sorts of cancers. There are 
some amazing things happening. The 
problem is they are expensive, Mr. 
Speaker. But they cure you. 
H.R. 3 does something that I think is 
fairly dark and fairly sinister, and we 
need our brothers and sisters on the 
Democrat side to be honest with con-
stituents, and that is something called 
reference pricing. If a quality year is 
bought through a drug, but it costs 
more than, in this case, $37,000 in Great 
Britain, Mr. Speaker, you don’t get it. 
H.R. 3 does this where they take a 
basket of some of these countries and 
say that we are going to use their cap. 
So, you are prepared to turn to your 
constituent and say: Oh, that drug is 
$40,000. Yes, it gives you that quality 
year, but it is over our cap, so we are 
not going to provide you that pharma-
ceutical. 
By doing that, we just destroyed 
small, disruptive bio-foundry pharma 
that is curing people. We are going to 
subject our population to say that the 
misery you have today is the misery 
you are going to have tomorrow, Mr. 
Speaker, because we are going to shut 
down the disruption. We are going to 
protect—here is the sinister thing that 
healthcare economists talk about. The 
Democrats’ H.R. 3 actually protects 
Big Pharma because the industry now 
becomes you just adjust your current 
patent, and that is how you make a liv-
ing, Mr. Speaker. 
But the ones that nip their heels that 
cure things, it is like the hepatitis C 
we cure now. Those cures don’t come 
because we have just wiped out the in-
come stream. 
We need to rethink. If Republicans 
and Democrats have a common goal 
that we need to look at pharmaceutical 
costs, then destroying the pipeline that 
cures people and that ends the misery 
is really dark. 
Mr. Speaker, we Republicans have 
our sins. How many of us will get be-
hind a microphone and talk about price 
transparency? Price transparency is a 
really good thing, but it has almost no 
real effect on the price of healthcare. 
The best academic studies we have 
been able to find in our office is 0.1 to 
0.7 percent. 
My point is really simple here. The 
ACA, ObamaCare, was a financing bill. 
It was who got subsidized and who had 
to pay. Our Republican alternative was 
a financing bill. It was who had to pay 
and who got subsidized. Medicare for 
All is a financing bill. 
When are we going to have the really 
tougher discussion of what we pay? 
Let’s disrupt the price of healthcare 
through technology. 
How many of us went to Blockbuster 
Video last weekend? We don’t because 
now we hit a button called Netflix and 
all sorts of other things. We allow dis-
ruption to happen in other parts of our 
healthcare, but we have built so many 
regulatory barriers and so many licens-
ing barriers, crazy things that would 
disrupt healthcare. 
One of my grand proposals—and this 
one needs to be Republicans and Demo-
crats coming together—that $68 tril-
lion over the next 30 years in just 
Medicare spending, that is a substan-
tial driver for U.S. sovereign debt. 
Thirty-one percent of it is just diabe-
tes. 
It turns out, Mr. Speaker, if you and 
I can have a revolution in ending the 
misery of diabetes, it is also the single 
biggest initiative you can have to U.S. 
sovereign debt. 
It is time Republicans and Democrats 
come together and do an Operation 
Warp Speed on diabetes. Yes, there is 
really neat research that is on the cusp 
of almost curatives for type 1, the 
autoimmune pancreatic cells. But the 
political side is going to be really 
tough for all of us because we are going 
to have to talk about type 2, which has 
a substantial lifestyle component in it. 
It needs a discussion of what we do in 
nutrition support as a country and 
what we do in our farm bill as a coun-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, if we care about people, 
if we really are going to come here and 
give speeches about how minority com-
munities and my Native American 
communities from Arizona had such 
horrible outcomes during COVID, are 
you 
willing 
to 
look 
at 
the 
comorbidities that were there before 
COVID? It is diabetes. 
b 1230 
And it turns out, spending money on 
this management curative—and I real-
ly want curative—turns out to be one 
of the most powerful things you and I 
could ever do for U.S. sovereign debt 
going forward. It is 31 percent of just 
Medicare spending, and the numbers we 
are still working on for Medicaid and 
other things. 
So part of my other proposal is there 
are things we could do almost over-
night that have incredible impacts on 
the cost of healthcare in this country; 
and here is one that I beg of us to start 
getting in our lexicon. 
Sixteen percent of the healthcare 
spending this year, over half a trillion 
dollars, just this year, will be people 
not taking their meds or taking them 
incorrectly. You have hypertension, 
you don’t take your meds, you have a 
stroke. You have high cholesterol, you 
don’t 
take 
your 
meds—and 
those 
things 
are 
cheap 
and 
inexpensive. 
Grandma is forgetful, or we get busy in 
our lives. 
And it turns out there are things 
where the pill top talks to your phone. 
It talks to you. There are other ones 
where it dispenses the pharmaceuticals 
to you. 
It turns out the technology of get-
ting people to take their pharma-
ceuticals properly, if we would under-
stand its impact, that is 16 percent of 
U.S. healthcare spending is just not 
taking our pharmaceuticals properly. 
That is a half a trillion dollars. 
Think about what you could do with 
a half a trillion dollars a year—not 
over 10, not over 15; a year—and how 
much less misery you would have in 
this country by people having strokes, 
getting sick. 
This is not a revolution of trying to 
crush pharma or go after drug prices. It 
is actually taking a look and using this 
crazy thing we call, oh, yeah, math, 
and a calculator, and also technology. 
And, yes, it doesn’t work necessarily 
in our political lexicon. It is a little 
harder to campaign on, but it happens 
to be factual. 
The other thing I am going to beg of 
us—and Congressman GOHMERT, I ap-
preciate him yielding to me. So I prom-
ise I will only do one or two more 
boards. 
I need us to think revolutionary. Be-
fore the pandemic, a Democratic col-
league, MIKE
THOMPSON, from Cali-
fornia, a good guy, has worked with me 
on telemedicine. It was a piece of legis-
lation that substantially was going to 
go nowhere because there were lots and 
lots and lots and lots of lobbyists who 
hated it because it disrupts the money. 
But when the pandemic hit, our tele-
medicine bill became law. It expires

when they declare the pandemic over. 
The expansion of reimbursement and 
access to telemedicine goes away. We 
need to fix that. 
But we also now need to understand 
what is telemedicine. Telemedicine is 
the thing you can wear on your wrist; 
the thing you can wear on your chest; 
the thing you blow into. 
The technology is here to crash the 
price of healthcare. And all the skep-
tics who attacked telemedicine before 
the pandemic, oh Grandma’s not going 
to be able to use; they don’t know how 
to work FaceTime; no one is going to 
want to make a phone call to a doctor 
or a healthcare professional. 
Turns out they were wrong. We have 
the last 18 months of proof. The satis-
faction rates are off the chart. A, we 
need to continue it, but we need to ex-
pand the definition. 
And then the other things the pan-
demic has brought us is things we 
never thought of. 
How about a little home kit? 
These are available today. Actually, 
you can get them sent to your house in 
a day. Blow into it. It tells you if you 
have COVID–19. 
Well, if that exists for COVID, what 
would happen if I turned to you and 
said, turns out we have the technology 
today where you can have a medical 
lab in your medicine cabinet. You blow 
into it, it tells you if you even have 
cancer cells or a virus or bacteria. It 
exists today. 
We, as a body, need to legalize the 
disruptive technologies that allow us 
to disrupt the price of healthcare if we 
are going to save Medicare, save the 
country from the crushing debt. And, 
yes, we are going to annoy a lot of in-
cumbent investors and a lot of incum-
bent businesses, but it is the right and 
moral thing to do. 
We have a society that has become a 
country of oligopolies, and Congress 
has become a protection racket. We 
protect incumbents; not incumbent 
elected officials, incumbent business 
models. 
Yet the disruption of the technology 
that is here today crushes the misery 
of so many of our brothers and sisters 
out there who have chronic conditions, 
that get sick. 
We can crash the price of healthcare. 
We can make us healthier as a society. 
We can take on, in that same breath, 
the crushing debt that is here. And it is 
demographic. It is coming. No matter 
how many speeches we give pretending 
we have a way around it, the only way 
around it is we have got to change the 
actual price of healthcare. 
I beg of us, we need to think dif-
ferently because this place, often our 
policy sets, sort of sounds like it is 
still the 1990s. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Would the gentleman 
yield for a question? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Oh, I would love 
to yield. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. SCHWEIKERT’s ongoing anal-
yses of the way we mismanage money 
around Washington, D.C. And I was 
reading about proposals to go after the 
billionaires, the mega-rich, and I recall 
what Ronald Reagan’s economist, eco-
nomic adviser, Arthur Laffer, had said. 
Dr. Laffer said—he told a small group 
of us years ago—if you want to produce 
money—of course, I am asking you this 
because I have such great respect for 
your monetary analyses. 
If you want to go after money, you 
want to produce tax revenue, the one 
place you will never get it is going 
after the super-rich because they are 
the only people in America who have 
the wherewithal to avoid whatever tax 
you put on them. 
What is your thought about that 
analysis? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I have actually 
been blessed to spend lots of time with 
Professor Laffer and, actually, a couple 
of other folks who also have Nobel 
Prizes in economics. They tolerate me. 
Gilder, I consider a personal friend, if 
you really want to geek out. 
First off, you have a conceptual prob-
lem and the left doesn’t—we have got 
to work with them to first admit we 
tax income. Property taxes are really 
the only things we tax wealth. We tax 
your real estate wealth. 
So the leaked IRS data, which is a 
real problem if you want confidence in 
a tax system that, once again, the IRS 
is back to being weaponized. If you 
want to tax wealth, that is a different 
tax system, and there are all sorts of 
games you can play with that. 
You could take your wealth and say, 
all right, here is what I am going to do. 
I am not going to take an income. I am 
going to borrow from it. 
So how do you tax it? 
You have to conceptualize very, very 
different. 
We also—we actually have the math, 
even though it may not happen in the 
fiscal 
year 
you 
want 
it 
to. 
The 
ultrawealthy give away most of their 
wealth. That has been a tradition in 
this country, particularly for about a 
century and a half. 
A tax system to work—and the gen-
tleman and I have actually had a side 
conversation about this. You have to 
find what is the most—or the least dis-
ruptive tax that maximizes revenue, 
but also maximizes economic expan-
sion. So we are already seeing some 
data that the Democrats’ proposal on 
capital gains tax, actually, without 
changing the basis, actually raises sub-
stantially less revenues. 
Now how is that possible? 
It is because you stop engaging in 
those economic activities. 
So somewhere there is a sweet spot 
that maximizes revenues, but also then 
maximizes economic activity. And I 
have an absolute fixation that 2018, 
2019 were miracle years economically 
for the working poor in this country. It 
is 2 years where, actually, income in-
equality genuinely shrank; the broad 
based nature of the working poor get-
ting dramatically less poor. 
That shouldn’t be a partisan fight. It 
should be the bipartisan goal. 
And the rich got richer, but not as 
fast as the poor got less poor. And that 
is back to, in a weird way, a long an-
swer to your question. 
We need to have an honest debate of 
what maximizes revenues while mini-
mizing economic damage. And right 
now, just throwing out numbers, and 
then throwing out fake—and I am 
being a little brutal on that—fake mod-
els from the administration saying we 
are going to raise $4 trillion, we are 
going to cover all of our new spending, 
when all of the other models—and very 
soon joint tax will score it and we will 
see what the reality is. 
But everyone it is scoring right now, 
the Dems are only getting about half 
the revenues. And we have already seen 
the first analysis of the corporate tax 
hike. It unemploys 1 million Ameri-
cans in the first 24 months. 
Mr. GOHMERT. That would be people 
who would pay income tax if they 
didn’t lose their jobs. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. That didn’t lose 
their jobs. And the harder part of the 
scoring is—and this was one of the mir-
acles of 2018 and 2019—the Democrats 
repeatedly attacked the tax reforms 
from the end of 2017 and the regulatory 
reforms. 
But there were so many people work-
ing, and there was such vitality in the 
economy that Medicare part A, the 
trust fund, grew in years. Social Secu-
rity grew in years because there were 
so many people paying their payroll 
tax. 
They didn’t really pay income tax be-
cause they were part of the population 
that had been removed from having to 
pay income tax because we changed— 
but it turns out, if you actually, truly 
believe we have a societal obligation to 
keep our promises, to keep Social Se-
curity, to keep Medicare vibrant, it 
turns out you need an incredibly vi-
brant economy for people to be work-
ing. You can do that also by a rational 
tax policy instead of a punishing one. 
Mr. GOHMERT. I know you would 
have—— 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I am sorry; it is a 
long answer, but it actually has—— 
Mr. GOHMERT. No, no. I appreciate 
my 
friend 
from 
Arizona, 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT’s excellent analysis, be-
cause we do want to have a vibrant 
economy. As the saying goes, it lifts all 
boats. And I really appreciate the anal-
ysis on where the Medicare spending is 
going. That is something we need to 
deal with. 
I hear solutions of throwing money 
at the problem, but the real problem is 
we don’t have the proper money to 
throw at it because the economy is not 
doing as it should. 
And then I still hear our friends talk 
about the need to stop climate change. 
Unfortunately, the climate has been 
changing since the Earth ever ap-
peared. And I have got a lot of friends 
out there. And I say friends face-
tiously. People on the left—I am begin-
ning to understand that sarcasm is a 
tool that is appreciated by the intel-
ligent. So the left, the alt-left, they 
don’t get it.

June 17, 2021 
But this is an article from Ethan 
Hunt back in August of 2019. It says: 
NASA admits that climate change oc-
curs because of changes in Earth’s 
solar orbit; not because of SUVs and 
fossil fuel. 
Well, it really can be a combination 
of things. But having found out from 
the former NASA Director that the 
Moon’s orbit is slightly changing and 
the Earth’s orbit is slightly changing 
and, as the term was, it is becoming 
more squashed, well, that would mean 
there are times when we are closer to 
the Sun and we are further away from 
the Sun. 
And I know there are some leftists at 
NASA that said: Oh, no, changing 
Earth’s orbit doesn’t affect our climate 
at all. 
And I would humbly submit that you 
don’t have to be a rocket scientist to 
understand that if you get closer to the 
Sun, or if you get further away from 
the Sun, it is absolutely going to affect 
your climate; just as more solar activ-
ity, more solar flares, they are going to 
affect our climate. And there is not a 
lot that we can do about more solar 
flares, solar activities, solar hot spots. 
And I would sarcastically ask a ques-
tion regarding the Bureau of Land 
Management and National Forest Serv-
ice, since they were going to be spend-
ing so much time on climate change, 
and we had heard the Earth’s orbit was 
changing slightly and the Moon’s orbit 
was changing slightly. 
Could they do anything about that? 
b 1245 
For those who thought I was really 
challenging BLM, the Bureau of Land 
Management and the National Forest 
Service, like they were going to do 
something about the Earth’s orbit, the 
National Forest Service and Bureau of 
Land Management, they are not going 
to do anything about the Earth’s orbit 
because they can’t. That is not their 
job. 
Although there is some professor 
that thinks we might could adjust our 
orbit, I think that is still yet to be ar-
rived at scientifically. It is an inter-
esting concept, but I had no belief that 
it was about to happen by the Bureau 
of Land Management and National For-
est Service. 
It is interesting to look back. I 
missed this article back in 2019. It goes 
into much more detail about not only 
the changing orbit but the changing 
tilt from time to time. 
Then if you do more digging, you find 
out that actually, going back mil-
lions—some say 56 million; some say 
billions—that the planet was much 
hotter, and the planet’s orbit was clos-
er to the Sun. It has moved back some, 
according to some, over the millions or 
billions, whatever you believe, number 
of years. 
I also want to mention this article 
from The Washington Times, June 16, 
2021, 
Stephen 
Dinan, 
about 
‘‘Smartphone smugglers: How social 
media is reshaping border crime.’’ It is 
really intriguing. The author does an 
amazing job of pulling these things to-
gether. 
It is interesting. The drug cartels 
south of our border, apparently, we are 
informed, have workers in every city in 
America. Of course, we have heard be-
fore that the Border Patrol, ICE, the 
U.S. Government is considered to be 
the logistics for the multibillion-dollar 
drug cartels in Mexico because the 
drug cartels get them across illegally 
into the United States. And I have seen 
people in the middle of the night, as 
they are being processed by the Border 
Patrol, long lines of people. I have 
watched them comparing addresses and 
sometimes switching addresses. 
They are the addresses that the drug 
cartels have given them as to where 
the drug cartels want them to go work 
in order to earn enough money, either 
drug trafficking, sex trafficking, or 
human trafficking, to pay off the rest 
of their debt to the drug cartels for 
getting them into the United States il-
legally. Many times, it is the U.S. Gov-
ernment, which means U.S. taxpayers, 
that end up paying to send the drug 
cartels’ employees, or indentured serv-
ants, to the cities where the drug car-
tels want them. 
It is incredible that we, as a U.S. 
Government, are helping the drug car-
tels in Mexico make the tens of billions 
of dollars that they use to keep dif-
ferent levels of government corrupt in 
Mexico, that keep the Mexican people 
from having the economy that would 
allow them to have across-the-board 
wonderful homes, have wonderful jobs, 
and be one of the top economies in the 
world. The corruption of the drug car-
tels keeps Mexico from having their 
true place in the top economies in the 
world. 
They have some of the hardest-work-
ing people in the world. They have in-
credible natural resources, a fantastic 
location—actually, 
better 
than 
the 
U.S. because they are between North 
and South America, and they are be-
tween the Pacific and the Atlantic. In-
credible location, hardworking people, 
great natural resources, good ports, 
but the corruption that the American 
people are funding through their U.S. 
Government and through the purchase 
of drugs that are massively coming 
into this country—if somebody truly 
has compassion for the people of Mex-
ico and Central America, they would 
demand that our southern border be se-
cured, that we continue to provide 
visas in greater numbers than any 
country in the world, but we secure the 
border so that we cut the tens of bil-
lions of dollars from flowing to the 
drug cartels that then corrupt and de-
stroy 
lives, 
kill 
Americans 
with 
fentanyl and other drugs that are pour-
ing into our country. And the Mexican 
people would come to the United 
States on vacation to spend the signifi-
cant, wonderful money they had earned 
without fear of the drug cartels and 
what they will do to them if they are 
not subservient. 
There was a time in Mexico when 
people who were wealthy knew the 
drug cartels would normally leave 
them alone. There was a time in Mex-
ico when the drug cartels basically had 
a wink-and-nod agreement: Look, we 
won’t have attacks in tourist attrac-
tions because we know how important 
that money is. 
Well, all of those days are gone. If we 
were really a compassionate neighbor, 
we would secure our border. We would 
stop drawing off people with the poten-
tial to be the best citizens that Guate-
mala, Mexico, other countries have, 
drawing them up here because of the 
corruption below our border that we in 
the U.S. Government are helping fund. 
It really needs to stop. But it is get-
ting worse, much, much worse, as we 
are seeing numbers that no one has 
seen in many, many years. 
There has been so much appropriate 
concern about January 6 and what hap-
pened that day. Unfortunately, we 
don’t know all that happened that day. 
There are some major questions that 
need to be answered. 
We know that the former chief of the 
Capitol Police testified that they got 
no intelligence from the FBI about po-
tential violence on January 6. There 
were lots of stories about people who 
were here at the Capitol on January 6 
that may have carried a Confederate 
flag, may have had red on and MAGA 
or Trump. 
But the Capitol Police had told me 
the day before: Hey, we have heard 
there are going to be people who hate 
Trump that are going to be trying to 
blend in, and there is going to be vio-
lence, and we are concerned about it. 
But the chief of the Capitol Police 
said they got no intel like that from 
the FBI. 
An article a few days ago from Re-
volver says: ‘‘Unindicted Co-Conspira-
tors in the January 6 Cases Raise Dis-
turbing Questions of Federal Fore-
knowledge.’’ That is June 14. I saw my 
friend Tucker Carlson covered this last 
night. 
But this is really disturbing, and this 
is something that I know from my time 
here in Congress has disturbed Demo-
crats and Republicans alike across the 
aisle because we don’t like to see gov-
ernment agents stirring up trouble or 
find that there are criminal acts that 
would not likely have occurred had not 
the Federal Government been partici-
pating, 
whether 
they 
were 
actual 
agents or undercover agents or inform-
ants that were working for the Federal 
Government. 
But this is scary stuff. This is kind of 
third-world stuff. This is not only 
third-world stuff, but this is like Putin 
kind of activity. 
If there were Federal agents that 
were involved on January 6, we really 
need to know what the FBI knew and 
when they knew it. Not only that, we 
need to know how much participation 
did any of our Federal friends, either at 
DOJ, FBI, or any of the intel commu-
nity, what kind of role were they play-
ing.

June 17, 2021 
There is information that came out 
about the effort to kidnap the Michi-
gan Governor, and it has been said that 
there were Federal agents that were in-
volved in that. It would seem, if you 
have 14 people that are involved in a 
conspiracy to commit a crime, and 
over a third of them, including people 
in leadership, are Federal agents, un-
dercover agents, or people that are 
working for a Federal entity, that we 
have got some serious problems, and 
we have not done adequate oversight. 
It disturbs me greatly that there was 
not 
more 
information 
forthcoming 
from our Federal law enforcement in-
telligence, DOJ, than was received here 
on Capitol Hill because, surely, if they 
had known the level of planning by a 
small group to actually commit vio-
lence and break into our U.S. Capitol, 
they would have been better prepared. 
I know some of us have had extreme 
differences with the Speaker, but I just 
feel sure if she had known the level of 
violence that was being talked about 
and planned and monitored by DOJ and 
FBI, surely she would not have allowed 
the Sergeant at Arms to turn down Na-
tional Guard support on January 6. 
This article pulls from documents, 
legal documents, that have been filed 
by the Federal Government in some of 
these different cases. This article says: 
‘‘To address the matter directly in the 
following three questions: In the year 
leading up to January 6 and during 
January 6 itself, to what extent were 
the three primary militia groups—the 
Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, and the 
Three Percenters—that the FBI, DOJ, 
Pentagon, and network news have la-
beled most responsible for planning and 
executing a Capitol attack on January 
6 infiltrated by agencies of the Federal 
Government, or informants of said 
agencies?’’ 
Question 2: ‘‘Exactly how many Fed-
eral undercover agents or confidential 
informants were present at the Capitol 
or in the Capitol during the infamous 
‘siege,’ and what roles did they play— 
merely passive informants or active in-
stigators?’’ 
And, third: ‘‘Finally, of all of the 
unindicted co-conspirators referenced 
in the charging documents,’’ the offi-
cial Federal pleadings, ‘‘of those in-
dicted for crimes on January 6, how 
many worked as a confidential inform-
ant or as an undercover operative for 
the Federal Government—FBI, Army 
Counterintelligence, et cetera?’’ 
b 1300 
‘‘If the narrative about January 6 
does not conform to the questions 
above, the American people will never 
learn the most important truth about 
what January 6 is, and what kind of 
country they’re really living in. 
‘‘If it turns out the Federal Govern-
ment did in fact have undercover 
agents or confidential informants em-
bedded within the so-called militia 
groups indicted for conspiring to ob-
struct the Senate certification on Jan-
uary 6, the implications would be noth-
ing short of seismic. Especially if such 
agents 
or 
informants 
enjoyed 
ex-
tremely senior-level positions within 
such groups.’’ 
And the thing is, like I said, they 
have got documentation, the Federal 
pleadings that the United States Gov-
ernment has filed in some of these 
cases, that really raised serious issues. 
Yeah, there is no question, there were 
radical groups there, and those three 
seem to be the most prominent. But 
from the pleadings from the Depart-
ment of Justice itself, it appears that 
they had significant presence and par-
ticipation in what went on. 
We do need to see the 14,000 hours of 
security video, seeing Ashli Babbitt 
killed by an officer standing off to the 
side. There were officers in front of the 
window, but then there were officers on 
the other side where Ashli was; and it 
appeared it was John Sullivan, a 
Trump hater, that told them if they 
will move out of the way they won’t 
get hurt, and the officers appeared. 
Well, they moved out of the way, and 
these guys broke through the glass. 
And yet with all of the people that 
the FBI has sought information on and 
put up pictures—and it appears they 
were probably wearing masks, but 
there is another 14,000 hours of video. 
These guys were around in the Capitol, 
around the Capitol. They didn’t have 
their masks up at all times. But it 
doesn’t appear that the FBI has asked 
for assistance in identifying those peo-
ple that broke through the glass or 
that were right there, at least when 
Ashli was shot in the neck and killed. 
And that normally means if they are 
not asking for help in identifying 
somebody that they know who they 
are—and maybe they are person 1, per-
son 2, person 3, person 15—that are re-
ferred to in the pleadings of people that 
were working with the FBI or Federal 
authorities of some kind. 
But this is very unsettling stuff. It 
was bad enough to have our Capitol at-
tacked. As a former felony judge, I 
would have no problem sending people 
to prison that broke into this Capitol, 
that literally broke in or that did dam-
age or that stole things here. There is 
no place for that, and they do need to 
be severely punished. 
But were some of those people doing 
those things working for the FBI? Were 
they egged on by Federal authorities? 
Because it sure looks like from some of 
these legal documents they filed and 
the masking of names and referring to 
them as something other than their 
real names that we have a serious prob-
lem with some of the people that were 
involved that day that it appears were 
either working for Federal authorities 
or were informants for Federal authori-
ties and had leadership positions in 
those groups and quite possibly, in 
some cases probably, helped to egg 
them on. 
This article says in many cases the 
unindicted co-conspirators appear to be 
much more aggressive and egregious 
participants in the very so-called con-
spiracy, serving as the basis for charg-
ing those indicted. The question imme-
diately arises as to why this is the case 
and forces us to consider whether cer-
tain individuals are being protected 
from indictment because they were in-
volved in January 6 as undercover 
operatives or confidential informants 
for a Federal agency. 
So another place further on in the ar-
ticle it points out: ‘‘This would be far 
worse than the already bad situation of 
the government knowing about the 
possibility of violence and doing noth-
ing. Instead, this would imply that ele-
ments of the federal government were 
active instigators in the most egre-
gious and spectacular aspects of Janu-
ary 6, amounting to a monumental en-
trapment scheme used as a pretext to 
imprison otherwise harmless protesters 
at the Capitol—and in a much larger 
sense used to frame the entire MAGA 
movement as potential domestic ter-
rorists.’’ 
There is so much more. Let’s see, fur-
ther on, I guess this is page 8/26. ‘‘In 
one of the plot’s climactic scenes, in 
the main van driving up to look at 
Governor Whitmer’s vacation home’’— 
and that is of course the plot to kidnap 
the Governor—‘‘three out of the five 
people in the van—60 percent of the 
plot’s 
senior 
leaders—were 
Federal 
agents and informants.’’ 
‘‘FBI infiltrators comprised, at the 
very least’’—talking about overall in 
that plot—‘‘26 percent of the plotters. 
That is, at least five FBI operatives 
have been disclosed, against just 14 sus-
pects indicted.’’ 
So looking at some of the pleadings 
by the DOJ themselves, but just to give 
an idea of what we are dealing with, it 
says, ‘‘On December 30, 2020, Watkins 
and Caldwell exchanged the following 
text messages: 
‘‘Watkins: Looks like we are green 
light to come to D.C. on the 6th. The 
rally point still at your place? 
‘‘Caldwell: Not that I am aware. Have 
been contacted by no one. Typical (Per-
son one). Here’s the rub: (Person two) 
and I will be in a hotel within striking 
distance of the city starting on the 4th, 
so we won’t even be here. There will be 
some stuff going on during the 5th, and 
we want to be a part of that whenever 
it shakes out.’’ 
Person one and person two were ap-
parently working for the Federal au-
thorities, some Federal agency. 
Another place it references person 
two, person three, person one, and they 
seem to be significant leaders in what 
is going on. 
Another place: Person three—emailed 
person three several maps along with 
the message. These maps will get you 
from the hotel into D.C. 
I mean, person 10 checked into the 
Hilton Garden Inn in Vienna. 
Person three, another reference. 
Person 15 and person 20 are ref-
erenced. 
These are people that they are cov-
ering up their names because they are 
working for the Federal authorities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2921 
June 17, 2021 
If you look at some of the video on 
January 6, there were a lot of people 
walking around. They had no business 
being in the Capitol. But it is quite 
concerning that people that were ex-
tremely active at all should have been 
or were working for Federal entities 
such that they have to cover up their 
names because of their complicity with 
the Federal authorities during that 
day. 
So that is United States versus 
Caldwell, Crowl, and then there is one 
Government’s Opposition to Defend-
ant’s Motion for Reconsideration of De-
tention. 
They are holding some of these peo-
ple still. Some with 23 hours, 24 hours 
a day in solitary. Some were just walk-
ing around, they did no damage. They 
should not have come into the Capitol, 
but it remains to be seen why the gov-
ernment has their stinger out so much 
for people no matter how mild their 
participation on January 6. 
And yet the biggest damage done to 
the United States in protests was last 
summer, and those folks aren’t being 
treated the same way that others are. 
So there are some very serious ques-
tions that need to be answered. We do 
need the answers. We need to know 
how many Federal agents; how many 
informants had given information to 
Federal agencies and why in the world 
all of that information was not pro-
vided to people that needed to protect 
Capitol Hill. 
So we need an investigation. We 
don’t need one that has an entire Dem-
ocrat staff. It needs to be truly bipar-
tisan to get to the bottom of just what 
happened that day and who caused it to 
happen. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
SERVICE BEFORE SELF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about service by recog-
nizing individuals and organizations 
who have stepped up when their fellow 
citizens needed them most. Through 
their actions, they have shown what it 
means to put others before self. 
DR. SATURNINO RODRIGUEZ 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I begin 
by rising today to honor Dr. Saturnino 
Rodriguez, a good friend and devoted 
servant of the Latino community in 
Lansing. 
Over the years, Dr. Rodriguez, or 
Nino as he is known around town, has 
had many titles. In each role, he has 
left a profound impact on the students, 
faculty, parents, and community resi-
dents that call greater Lansing home. 
Dr. Rodriguez has spent his entire 
professional life working in schools— 
first in Peru, then in Grand Rapids, and 
then Lansing, where he has worked 
tirelessly for the past 50 years to im-
prove the lives of children through edu-
cation. His career has taken him from 
being a counselor at C.W. Otto Junior 
High, an assistant principal at Gardner 
Junior High and Eastern High School, 
principal at Pattengill Middle School, 
and finally as deputy superintendent of 
the entire school district. 
He was an innovator in the class-
room, developing a clustered teaching 
approach that is still being used today. 
In addition, he led the adoption of 
guidelines proposed by the Youth Vio-
lence 
Prevention 
Coalition, 
which 
brought 
about 
significant 
positive 
changes in student and community re-
lations. 
Since 2009, he has been an elected 
member of the Lansing District Board 
of Education, a role that he carries out 
with joy because it allows him to con-
tinue his service to Lansing students. 
Dr. Rodriguez’ passions extend be-
yond education. He is an officer with 
the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
and a member of the Ingham County 
Health Department’s Board of Health. 
But to really know Dr. Rodriguez, you 
only need to read his monthly maga-
zine Adelante Forward. 
Published in both English and Span-
ish, Adelante Forward has been an in-
strumental source of information for 
the Lansing community, advertising 
new businesses and spreading word 
about resources from Head Start class-
es to COVID vaccine clinics. It has 
been a key way to reach Latino and 
Hispanic residents, bridging the lan-
guage gap in order to improve commu-
nity relations. And, as I am sure Dr. 
Rodriguez is proud to know, it is even 
being used by some Spanish language 
teachers as part of their lesson plans. 
The publication wouldn’t be possible 
without the special partners that work 
to put it together: Danny Layne, 
Allena Tapia, Patricia Briones, and Dr. 
George Mansour. In addition, no trib-
ute to Dr. Rodriguez would be complete 
without mention of his wife of 30 years, 
Margarita, as well as their two daugh-
ters and two grandchildren. 
It is my privilege to represent Dr. 
Rodriguez in Washington. I am grateful 
for his willingness to always speak to 
me about Lansing’s needs. Every time 
we are able to connect, it is a pleasure 
to hear about the good work being done 
to improve the lives of others. I am ap-
preciative of his commitment to serv-
ing others, and it is my honor to recog-
nize him today in the permanent 
RECORD of the people’s House.

HONORING LISA BRINKER 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ms. Lisa Brinker, a 
resident of Lake Orion, who has been 
there for her community when it need-
ed her most. 
Ms. Brinker has faced adversity in 
her life. Three years ago, her husband 
passed away from brain cancer. Out of 
that pain, she found purpose. Over the 
course of the last year, she has devoted 
her time to the New Day Foundation 
for Families, a local nonprofit that 
supports those fighting cancer and 
their loved ones. 
The financial cost of a cancer diag-
nosis goes beyond just medical care, as 
I know well. Beyond the loss of income, 
the increase in expenses, and emotional 
distress, it is a diagnosis that can con-
sume us entirely. And that is where the 
New Day Foundation for Families 
comes in. With an army of local volun-
teers like Ms. Brinker, they provide re-
sources to give cancer patients hope 
through financial assistance and emo-
tional support. 
When her husband was in the hos-
pital, Ms. Brinker was surrounded by 
family, friends, and churchgoers who 
helped lighten the load. For her, she 
wouldn’t have known what to do with-
out that help. And it is why she works 
so hard to make someone else’s load a 
little lighter. During the pandemic, 
when 
family 
members 
of 
immunocompromised patients saw a 
trip to the grocery store as a fraught 
experience, Ms. Brinker was there to 
provide for their essential needs. 
Since the program began last spring, 
volunteers like Lisa made more than 
300 deliveries helping 125 families in 
total. They were a godsend during 
COVID, and not just for their food de-
liveries. By demonstrating that service 
doesn’t stop, not even during a once-in- 
a-generation pandemic, Ms. Brinker 
was 
a 
source 
of 
inspiration 
and 
strength. With an infectious attitude 
that brightens the days of all she 
serves, we are lucky to have her in our 
community. 
Ms. Brinker has persevered through 
adversity and loss, and it has mag-
nified her service. With the powerful 
perspective that comes with experi-
ence, she has used it to better her Lake 
Orion community. As a humble spirit, 
she prefers that any recognition focus 
on making a difference. An article in 
the local paper ended with her asking 
readers to get themselves involved. 
And true to form, for this recognition, 
she indicated that credit should go to 
the good people of the New Day Foun-
dation for Families. 
It is a rare soul who can reduce pain 
and hardship in others, especially when 
they themselves have been in that posi-
tion. For her work to honor the loving 
memory of her husband and her tireless 
service to community, it is my privi-
lege to recognize Lisa Brinker on the 
House floor today. 
HONORING LISA KOCAB 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize another Lisa, the 
ultimate champion and advocate for 
the disability community in Brighton, 
Michigan, Ms. Lisa Kocab. 
Put simply, Lisa is a powerhouse. As 
a teacher and a mother of five, includ-
ing an incredible 10-year-old boy, PJ, 
who has Down syndrome, she has built 
and created an incredible circle of sup-
port since moving back to Michigan in 
2016.

At first, when she was scouting 
schools for PJ, she had to push through 
being told ‘‘no.’’ The family wanted to 
move back to be nearer to the kids’ 
grandparents, but the first school dis-
trict that they called referred to stu-
dents with special needs as ‘‘those 
kids.’’ Other schools gave similar re-
sponses when asked if PJ could be 
placed in general education. 
That is, until she called Brighton’s 
special education director, who told 
Lisa that PJ could absolutely go to 
school with the other students; that if 
they moved to Brighton, she would 
work with them. So that is what Lisa 
and her husband did. 
Now, Lisa will be the first to tell you 
that it wasn’t always smooth sailing. 
She has had to overcome plenty of 
challenges from PJ’s struggles with de-
velopment to the hurt of hearing intol-
erant words and from other families. 
Lisa has been tested in too many 
ways to count, but she has turned her 
pain into purpose by deciding to open 
Gigi’s Playhouse in Southfield, Michi-
gan. With more than 45 locations na-
tionwide, Gigi’s Playhouses are now 
‘‘achievement centers’’ for individuals 
with Down syndrome. They are spaces 
that are specifically designed for kids 
to interact and play with each other 
while offering free programs to learn 
how to read, improve their health, de-
velop career skills, and reach their 
greatest potential. 
Lisa was the driving force behind 
fundraising, searching for a location, 
and pulling resources together. Now, 
with her dream a reality, she strives 
every day to realize the vision of Gigi’s 
Playhouses, to see a world where indi-
viduals with Down syndrome are ac-
cepted and embraced in their families, 
schools, and communities. 
In its first year of operation, Gigi’s 
served 383 people with Down syndrome, 
more than half of whom were adults. 
Since then, they have expanded their 
offerings and, in order to help more 
residents, even adapting during the 
pandemic by switching to virtual pro-
grams. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a firm believer in 
finding your people, those who will 
have your back and stay by your side 
through ups and downs, failures and 
successes. Without a doubt, Lisa Kocab 
has found her people in Brighton and at 
Gigi’s Playhouse; and the disability 
community in Michigan has found its 
person in Lisa. 
She is an inspiration to us all, and I 
am so proud to represent her here in 
the Halls of Congress. It is my honor to 
speak these words into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD so that her story can 
inspire all who read it. 
RECOGNIZING THE WONG FAMILY 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a staple of the com-
munity, the Wong family of Wong Ex-
press House in Brighton. 
Before moving to Michigan, Xueqi 
Wong worked as a fisherman and a se-
curity officer for his town while raising 
his family with his wife, Mei, in Fujian 
province, China. 
They immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, 
moving to Brighton 10 years later, 
where they have built a successful 
business with a loyal following for the 
last two decades. Mr. Wong, known as 
Ed around town, is known for his work 
ethic and attention to detail. His em-
ployees rave about the culture he 
brings to the team. ‘‘Extremely flexi-
ble and supportive,’’ ‘‘Very welcoming 
and inspiring,’’ ‘‘I feel honored to work 
with such excellent people’’ is some of 
what they have said. 
Mr. Wong’s character truly came 
through in his devotion to keeping his 
customers and employees safe during 
COVID–19. At a time when restaurants 
and dining establishments were par-
ticularly hard hit by the public health 
restrictions, Mr. Wong put a plan in 
place to allow Wong Express House to 
stay afloat. 
After closing for 9 weeks, they re-
opened on May 29, 2020, as a model for 
safe service. With a separate enclosed 
area inside the restaurant, the dining 
area 
was 
transformed 
into 
a 
contactless pickup window for cus-
tomer convenience. Instead of dine-in, 
the restaurant trained staff to fully 
transition into drive-thru and carry- 
out only. 
The changes were not easy, but the 
space was turned into a safe, simple, 
and effective process that limited cus-
tomer-to-staff interaction, keeping ev-
eryone safe from infection. That abil-
ity to adapt, to work through the chal-
lenges in order to keep customers sat-
isfied, is why I am proud to recognize 
Mr. Wong; his wife, Mei; their son, Jian 
on the floor of the House today. 
Their pride in their restaurant is evi-
dent as soon as you walk in the door, 
and their resilience can be found in 
their dedication to each other and our 
community. 
During 
the 
shutdown, 
when Jian had to travel back to Brook-
lyn to support his wife and two kids, 
Mr. and Mrs. Wong stayed in Brighton 
holding down the fort to make sure 
that their staff would be taken care of. 
It is no surprise that on their first 
day back in business they were so over-
whelmed with support to the point that 
they completely sold out of food. Now, 
as they chart a course for the weeks 
and months ahead, I know that the 
Wong family will continue to dem-
onstrate the toughness and grit that 
Michiganians are known for during un-
certain times. 
On behalf of a grateful community, it 
is my honor to recognize the leadership 
and staff at Wong Express House by in-
serting their story of resilience into 
the permanent RECORD so that it may 
last for years to come. 
RECOGNIZING PECKHAM, INCORPORATED 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an organization in 
my district that goes above and beyond 
by providing job training opportunities 
for folks with significant disabilities 
and other barriers to employment. 
A 
nonprofit 
based 
in 
Lansing, 
Peckham, 
Incorporated, 
provides 
a 
platform for people to demonstrate 
their unique abilities by learning new 
skills and enjoying the rewards of an 
honest day’s works. From career plan-
ning to vocational training, to em-
ployer services, Peckham offers more 
than 30 different programs that create 
opportunities for every single indi-
vidual they work with. 
Named after the former rehabilita-
tion services director of the State of 
Michigan, Ralf Peckham, they began 
serving the greater Lansing region in 
1976. Today, they have grown into one 
of the largest community rehabilita-
tion programs in the entire State. 
With core values of compassion, com-
munity, and collaboration as a founda-
tion, Peckham has broken the mold of 
what a human services agency can be. 
They go beyond just matching skills to 
places of employment. They treat each 
person, no matter their ability, with 
respect and dignity. Their holistic ap-
proach to each situation allows them 
to build an environment of trust, where 
each person they work with can thrive. 
A physical, cognitive, behavioral, or 
socioeconomic challenge should never 
get in the way of someone realizing 
their full potential. To that end, 
Peckham makes our district and our 
State a better place to live. At a funda-
mental level, they help folks to earn 
economic and personal independence 
by creating, sustaining, and improving 
employment opportunities in our com-
munity. 
Peckham is a leader of workplace 
culture, from how employers view men-
tal health to how to safely reopen as 
we see a light at the end of the tunnel 
in COVID–19. For their efforts, they 
have been featured in Fortune Maga-
zine’s Great Places to Work List, and 
recognized by the U.S. Department of 
Labor with the Gold Hire Vets Medal-
lion Award. 
Mr. Speaker, accessibility and diver-
sity are cornerstones of a modern 
workplace. They make our economy 
stronger, bring our communities clos-
er, and demonstrate what our country 
is all about: Equality of opportunity. 
Today, I am proud to congratulate 
Peckham on 45 successful years har-
nessing the power of acceptance. They 
develop potential, work with purpose, 
and deliver results. With these remarks 
on the House floor, may their contribu-
tions to our Nation live on in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD. 
RECOGNIZING LIVINGSTON COUNTY MEDICAL 
RESERVE CORPS 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because, in Livingston County, 
there is a group of retired medical pro-
fessionals and volunteers that answer 
the call to serve by staying in action 
and continuing to train in the event of 
emergencies. 
In 2006, the Livingston County Med-
ical Reserve Corps was founded as a 
public health volunteer team. Today, I 
am proud to honor them on the House 
floor during their work during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
As one of the 762 Medical Reserve 
Corps units in the Nation, they are

part of a network of locally organized 
groups that strive to improve the 
health and safety of our communities. 
In Livingston County, our reserve 
corps is composed of 194 members, with 
an extra 80 volunteers, dedicating their 
time at the clinic. These folks are reg-
istered 
nurses, 
pharmacists, 
physi-
cian’s assistants, nurse practitioners, 
paramedics, 
licensed 
professional 
nurses, EMTs, firefighters, veterinar-
ians, chiropractors, social workers, 
teachers, public health professionals, 
and 
others 
with 
nonmedical 
backgrounds. 
They come from all walks of life, but 
they are motivated to their cause, 
which is a healthier Livingston Coun-
ty. And their work during the pan-
demic is nothing short of heroic. They 
helped with mask packaging and dis-
tribution, staffing a COVID hotline, 
contact tracing, and vaccine support. 
Without the reserve corps, the county 
would not have been able to respond as 
effectively. 
Since the beginning of last year, tem-
porary staff have logged almost 7,000 
hours on duty, with volunteers adding 
another 5,000 hours. These hours rep-
resent shots in arms, questions an-
swered, fears put at ease, and more. 
When our people need it the most, 
the Medical Reserve Corps stepped up. 
Their training designed for full-scale 
emergencies meant the difference when 
Livingston County was tested like 
never before. 
I am so grateful for each and every 
member who has proudly worn the yel-
low vest of the Medical Reserve Corps. 
Mr. Speaker, I especially want to rec-
ognize Jennifer Kramer, the Medical 
Reserve Corps coordinator, who has 
certainly personally put in incredibly 
long hours in service to others. 
With their motto of Partner, Provide, 
Prepare, and Protect, the Medical Re-
serve Corps makes the extraordinary 
seem ordinary. I have seen them in ac-
tion myself when I visited a vaccina-
tion clinic in January. They are orga-
nized, efficient, and wholly devoted to 
the cause. 
It is my great honor to speak these 
words into the official RECORD so that 
future generations can read about 
these heroes who were there when we 
needed them most. 
RECOGNIZING CRISTO REY COMMUNITY CENTER 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Cristo Rey Commu-
nity Center, a nonprofit organization 
that has been meeting the needs of the 
Lansing community since 1968. 
As 
a 
comprehensive, 
basic-needs 
service center, Cristo Rey is an invalu-
able source for residents, no matter 
their station in life. The center’s 
health clinic serves the uninsured and 
underinsured while offering counseling 
to those struggling with substance 
abuse and addiction. Their financial 
counselors help folks develop healthy 
spending and saving habits, and their 
community kitchen serves free hot 
breakfast and lunch Monday through 
Friday. 
In 2018 alone, Cristo Rey served over 
56,000 members of their community. 
They distributed over 357,000 pounds of 
food, and provided more than 21,000 
meals to the hungry. Their family 
health center cared for nearly 2,800 
unique patients, empowered 1,500 indi-
viduals to manage their finances, and 
helped families save over $700,000 in 
prescription drug costs.

In addition to these programs, Cristo 
Rey served as an essential warming 
center during harsh winters and as a 
cooling center during sweltering sum-
mers for the roughly 5,000 individuals 
who are homeless in the Lansing area. 
Every day, Cristo Rey staff live up to 
their 
motto: 
‘‘Serving 
individuals, 
serving families, serving communities. 
Always with compassion. Always with 
respect.’’ 
Wherever there is a need, whether it 
is a basic need, a spiritual need, or a 
societal need, Cristo Rey is there. Yes, 
they offer support and care, but they 
also focus on self-sufficiency and hon-
oring the dignity of every person who 
walks through their doors. 
For the poor and vulnerable, immi-
grants and migrants, and all people in 
need, regardless of language or culture, 
Cristo Rey is instrumental in the work 
to break the cycle of poverty and lift 
the community up. As a trusted orga-
nization, they are crucial to building 
bridges between different parts of the 
city. 
In 2019, during the search for a new 
police chief, Cristo Rey hosted the first 
community meet-and-greet for Daryl 
Green, who became Lansing’s chief of 
police. 
When 
our 
community 
was 
rocked by COVID, Cristo Rey was one 
of the first to retool its programs and 
offerings in order to start adapting to 
changing times. 
These days, with a grant from the 
Dart Foundation, the center has been 
able to offer vaccinations to residents, 
particularly in underserved and hard- 
to-reach communities, which is essen-
tial for bringing down the rates of in-
fection and reopening Michigan’s econ-
omy. 
For their 50 years of service to Lan-
sing, it is my great honor to recognize 
the men and women who truly do God’s 
work at Cristo Rey Community Center. 
May they continue to live out their 
mission for the next 50 years and for as 
long as these words remain in the 
RECORD of the people’s House. 
RECOGNIZING LACASA 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize LACASA, a non-
profit in my community that has stood 
out as a beacon of hope for thousands 
of vulnerable women and children in 
mid-Michigan. 
In 1979, LACASA was founded as the 
Livingston 
Area 
Council 
Against 
Spousal Abuse. With just $40 in dona-
tions and a part-time director at a desk 
in a borrowed office space, the organi-
zation first relied entirely on volun-
teers, 
selfless 
local 
residents 
who 
opened up their own homes so that sur-
vivors of domestic violence could find 
refuge. 
Later on, as it grew, LACASA was 
able to rent, then buy, and finally ex-
pand to a permanent shelter where 
women and children can access coun-
seling services, legal advocacy, and 
wraparound support. 
In addition to sanctuary, LACASA 
offers 24-hour crisis response with 
trained staff who are able to intake 
and serve the diverse needs of survivors 
of child abuse, domestic abuse, and sex-
ual assault. For so many in our com-
munity, the folks at LACASA are di-
rectly responsible for giving them the 
tools and strength to begin the road to-
ward a better future. 
However, pandemics don’t stop abus-
ers. In fact, when outside stressors 
occur, abuse historically tends to esca-
late. So when shelter-in-place orders 
took effect last year, closing LACASA 
and its around-the-clock facility was 
not an option. Record numbers of vic-
tims seeking help and refuge contacted 
them, and their ability to adapt is 
nothing short of heroic. 
In 2020 alone, LACASA provided 1,170 
overnight stays in hotel rooms and 
over 3,500 off-site meals for victims and 
their families. They expanded capacity 
to handle a 230-percent increase in 
child forensic interviews. 
LACASA saw the number of calls to 
their 24/7 helpline nearly double when 
the number of individuals seeking per-
sonal protection orders more than tri-
pled compared to an average year. 
Mr. Speaker, I have had the chance 
to personally visit LACASA, touring 
their shelter and working with their 
president, CEO, and badass, Bobette 
Schrandt, on several occasions. I am so 
thankful for her leadership and for the 
entire organization’s tireless support 
and work to provide a port in the 
storm for local residents. 
They are a model for similar non-
profits, earning national accreditation 
from the National Children’s Alliance 
as a children’s advocacy center just 
last week. Bobette told me herself. It is 
their highest level of membership, an 
honor 
that 
says 
everything 
about 
LACASA’s dedication to addressing 
childhood abuse in southeast Michigan. 
Today, I am proud to lift up their 
trauma-informed procedures and prac-
tices as a shining beacon of hope in 
Michigan’s Eighth District. 
On behalf of a grateful community, 
thank you for the work that you do, 
and may you continue to lead the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, although we cannot see 
You with our eyes or touch You with 
our hands, we have experienced the re-
ality of Your might and majesty. Every 
time we hear a newborn baby cry or 
touch a leaf or see the sky, we know 
why we believe. 
Lord, send Your spirit to fill the 
hearts of our Senators. As they journey 
toward eternity, may they walk, Lord, 
this day on the path You have pro-
vided. Give them a passion to glorify 
You in their thoughts, words, and

and humility. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen.

f 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
ever since Democrats passed the Af-
fordable Care Act, expanding health 
coverage and access to tens of millions 
of Americans, we have had to fight 
tooth and nail to preserve the law from 
partisan Republican attacks. 
For more than a decade, the assault 
on our healthcare law was relentless 
from Republicans in Congress, from the 
executive branch itself and from Re-
publican 
attorneys 
general 
in 
the 
courts. In a landmark vote, we in the 
Senate prevented the Republicans from 
repealing the ACA in 2017. 
Each time, in each arena, the Afford-
able Care Act has prevailed, and once 
again today, the U.S. Supreme Court, 
in a 7-to-2 ruling, upheld the Affordable 
Care Act in the face of another legal 
challenge. So let me say definitively: 
The Affordable Care Act has won. The 
Supreme Court has just ruled. The ACA 
is here to stay. 
And now we are going to try to make 
it bigger and better—establish once 
and for all affordable healthcare as a 
basic right of every American citizen. 
What a day. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another issue, infrastructure, despite a 
consensus in Washington that America 
needs more investment in our infra-
structure, it has been decades since 
Congress passed a stand-alone bill to 
address the issue. This Congress is 
working hard to remedy that fact. 
As I have repeated, discussions about 
infrastructure 
are 
moving 
forward 
along two tracks. One is bipartisan, 
and the second deals with components 
of the American jobs and families plan, 
which we will consider even if it lacks 
bipartisan support—though, I would 
note that a recent poll showed that 
President Biden’s infrastructure and 
family plan is broadly popular. Nearly 
70 percent of Americans support Presi-
dent Biden’s infrastructure plan. More 
than 60 percent support additional sup-
port for American families. 
Now, despite some overdramatized 
punditry, the truth is both tracks are 
moving forward very well, and both 
tracks need each other. So we want to 
work with our Republican colleagues 
on infrastructure where we have com-
mon ground, and Democrats believe we 
have other priorities that the Senate 
must consider above and beyond a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill, not the 
least of which is addressing the urgent 
challenge of climate change. 
Yesterday, I convened all 11 Members 
of the Senate Budget Committee to dis-
cuss the reconciliation track. And 
today, I will convene the group of 
Democrats negotiating with Repub-
licans to discuss the bipartisan track. 
We set up the two tracks about a 
month ago. Each is proceeding along, 
and the two tracks are parallel, work-
ing in concert, progressing well.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
voting rights, now we are here on the 
precipice of a momentous debate here 
in the Senate. Last night, I began the

June 17, 2021 
process to consider voting rights legis-
lation here on the floor of the Senate 
next week. The process I used will 
allow the Senate to consider S. 1 or 
compromise legislation that is cur-
rently being discussed. In either case, 
our goal remains crystal clear: protect 
the right to vote, strengthen our de-
mocracy, and put a stop to the tide of 
voter suppression flooding across our 
country. We will not consider legisla-
tion that does not achieve those objec-
tives. The issue is too important. 
Republican State legislatures are 
conducting the most sweeping attack 
on the right to vote since the begin-
ning of Jim Crow. What is their stated 
reason for vicious assaults on voting 
rights? They say it is election integ-
rity. 
But listen to these policies and tell 
me if you think they are about election 
integrity: 
Reducing polling hours and polling 
places. What does that have to do with 
election integrity? 
Mandating that every precinct, no 
matter how large or how small, have 
the same number of ballot drop boxes. 
What does that have to do with elec-
tion integrity? 
It is saying urban areas should have 
less ability to vote than rural areas. 
No after-hours voting, no 24-hours 
voting, no drive-through voting. 
Requiring absentee ballots to be ap-
proved by a notary public. 
Making it a crime to give food and 
water to voters waiting in long lines at 
the polls. 
Allowing a judge or panel of judges to 
overturn an election. 
Allowing a partisan State election 
board to replace a duly elected county 
election board if they are ‘‘underper-
forming.’’ 
Removing student IDs from the list 
of valid forms of ID. 
Moving the hours of Sunday voting 
into the evening—which, coinciden-
tally, 
makes 
it 
harder 
for 
Black 
churches to sponsor voter drives after 
services. 
Are any of these policies—I would 
ask a single Republican on this Senate 
floor to get up and say any of these 
policies are dealing with election in-
tegrity. 
We know what they are doing. They 
are making it harder for people to vote. 
And if this so-called voter fraud—elec-
tion fraud—which we have seen none of 
in 2020, if they cared about that across 
the board, why did they aim almost all 
of their proposals at people of color, at 
poor people, at young people, at urban 
people? 
We know why. This is not about 
voter fraud. It is about suppressing the 
vote, particularly of Democratic-lean-
ing voters. It is despicable. It is anti- 
democratic. It is what they do in dicta-
torships—manipulate the vote, instead 
of counting it accurately. 
Georgia, 
Iowa, 
Montana, 
Florida, 
Alabama, Utah, Arizona, Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkan-
sas—this is where some of these poli-
cies that I just mentioned are now law. 
They would also be in effect in Texas 
had Democratic lawmakers not walked 
out of the chamber in protest. Since 
the beginning of the year, 14 States 
have enacted 22 laws—22 laws—to make 
it harder to vote. 
Now, I know what the Republicans 
are saying. They are saying: Oh, well, 
we are making it easier to vote but 
harder to cheat. 
But when you look at what they are 
actually doing, it is perfectly clear 
that Republicans across the country 
are making it harder to vote and mak-
ing it easier to steal an election. They 
are targeting all the ways that poorer, 
younger, 
non-White 
and 
typically 
Democratic voters access the ballot, 
and they are giving new tools to par-
tisan election boards and unelected 
judges to interfere with the results of a 
democratic election—interfere with the 
results of a democratic election. Does 
that sound like a democracy? No, it 
sounds like an autocracy, a dictator-
ship. 
When you lose an election, you are 
supposed try to win over more voters, 
not try to stop the other side from vot-
ing. These laws are un-American, auto-
cratic, and against the very, very grain 
of our grand democracy, which, for im-
mediate partisan advantage, our Re-
publican friends are trying to under-
mine. 
So the Senate is going to debate 
what to do about these laws at the Fed-
eral level next week. In an ideal world, 
this debate would be bipartisan. Voting 
rights shouldn’t be a Democratic issue 
or a Republican issue, and in the early 
days of the second-half of the last cen-
tury, that is just what it was—bipar-
tisan. But, unfortunately, now it has 
become totally partisan. 
Donald Trump and his Big Lie have 
enveloped the Republican Party, and 
they run away from truth and honesty 
and fairness to just appease someone 
with authoritarian instincts, Donald J. 
Trump. 
And for all the shame that Repub-
lican State legislators have brought 
upon themselves, Washington Repub-
licans have not covered themselves in 
glory either. Here in Washington, Re-
publicans have failed to forcefully and 
repeatedly stand up to the Big Lie that 
the last election was stolen from Don-
ald Trump. That same Big Lie is fuel-
ing these voter suppression laws from 
one end of the country to the other. 
House Republicans are comparing Jan-
uary 6 to a tourist visit. 
I was within 20 feet of these awful in-
surrectionists. They were not tourists. 
They were brandishing sticks and guns 
and this and that. 
House Republicans also fired Con-
gresswoman CHENEY. For what? Telling 
the truth that Joe Biden is President. 
Just yesterday, 21 House Republicans 
voted against awarding the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the police officers 
who withstood the attack on the 6th. 
Are Republicans becoming antipolice? 
Some of the same Republicans who 
falsely accuse Democrats of wanting to 
defund the police are actively refusing 
to defend the police. 
I wish I could say the Senate was to-
tally different than the House—the Re-
publican House—but here we have a 
Senate Republican saying that it really 
wasn’t a violent insurrection. We have 
Senate Republicans refusing to include 
any mention of the causes for January 
6 in committee reports, and the Repub-
lican minority mounted a partisan fili-
buster against an independent, bipar-
tisan Commission. 
That is what is happening in the 
present-day Republican Party: a hor-
net’s nest of conspiracy theories and 
voter suppression in the States and a 
Washington Republican establishment 
that is too afraid of Donald Trump to 
stand up for our democracy with con-
viction. 
So look, we Democrats wish the vot-
ing bill would be bipartisan. By all 
rights, it should be. But the actions in 
State legislatures like Georgia, Iowa, 
and Florida were totally partisan. 
None of these voter suppression laws 
were passed with bipartisan support— 
not one. Washington Republicans seem 
dead set against all remedies, whether 
it is S. 1, some modified version, or the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which 
Senator MCCONNELL has recently op-
posed. So the idea that we can have 
some kind of bipartisan solution to 
this partisan attack on democracy be-
fuddles me. Regrettably, the Demo-
cratic Party is the only party standing 
up for democracy right now. 
Next week, the Senate will have this 
debate. Democrats will bring forward 
legislation to protect voting rights and 
safeguard our democracy, and we are 
going to see where everyone stands— 
everyone.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-

f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
next week, as the Democratic leader 
has indicated, the Senate will finally 
get the opportunity to vote on the bill 
that House and Senate Democrats have 
both made their No. 1 priority for the 
entire Congress. S. 1 is a bad bill filled 
with bad ideas, and I have been crystal 
clear about opposing it from the very 
beginning. 
But for Democrats themselves, com-
ing up with a compelling rationale for 
this 
unprecedented 
political 
power 
grab has been a long and winding road. 
It started back in 2019. Then, our 
friends on the left were still trying to 
wrap their heads around a stunning de-
feat in the 2016 Presidential election, 
so the Speaker of the House billed H.R. 
1 as a major overhaul for what her 
party concluded was a profoundly bro-
ken democracy. 
Then, 2020 changed everything. A 
Democrat actually won the White 
House. I guess our democracy wasn’t 
broken after all. This time, apparently, 
Federal authorities just needed urgent 
protection from State legislatures run-
ning their own elections. 
So we are talking about fundamen-
tally the very same bill. And one thing 
is for certain: Major overhaul doesn’t 
even begin—begin—to describe it. The 
awful guts are all in there. 
There is the plan to forcibly rewrite 
large portions of the 50 States’ respec-
tive election laws and the plan to cre-
ate new, publicly funded accounts not 
for building roads or bridges, expanding 
rural broadband, or fighting the opioid 
epidemic, but just piles of Federal dol-
lars going to yard signs, balloons, and 
TV ads for candidates at least half of 
Americans disagree with. 
There is the plan to trash a decades- 
old, bipartisan consensus on the right 
way to call balls and strikes on elec-
tions and turn the even split of the 
Federal Election Commission into a 
partisan majority and the one to give 
that majority new and broader tools 
for chilling the rights of citizens to en-
gage in political speech it doesn’t like. 
It is such a radical proposal that 
even prominent voices on the left have 
urged caution. Lawyers from ACLU, no 
less, have sounded the alarm on its pro-
posed encroachment on free speech. 
One liberal expert went further, saying 
that if Democrats think their bill is 
‘‘essential to secure democracy, they 
are self-deceived or deceitful.’’ And 
voters themselves are hardly con-
vinced. When asked about election 
policies like voter ID, large—large— 
majorities consistently come down on 
the opposite side of Washington Demo-
crats. The bill is so transparently op-
portunistic, the Democrats’ spin has 
failed to even unite their own party 
here in the Senate. It is a massive 
takeover of our election system with a 
fill-in-the-blank rationale. Nobody is 
fooled, and next week, the Senate will 
reject it. 
f 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on another matter entirely, the 
House of Representatives will vote 
today on a bill from Representative 
BARBARA LEE to repeal one of the key 
authorities behind nearly two decades 
of U.S. efforts to fight terrorism: the 
2002 authorization for the use of mili-
tary force. House Democrats claim this 
vote is an urgent act of congressional 
oversight, and the Democratic leader 
has indicated the Senate will take it up 
with similar zeal. 
The right way to address ongoing ter-
rorist threats is a debate certainly 
worth having. I would have welcomed 
that debate before the Biden adminis-
tration began its hasty retreat from 
Afghanistan without a plan to sustain 
counterterror missions or support our 
friends. It is one we should have before 
we vote to repeal these authorities. Re-
ality is more complicated, more dan-
gerous, and less politically convenient 
than its supporters actually believe. 
The fact is, the legal and practical 
application of the 2002 AUMF extends 
far beyond the defeat of Saddam Hus-
sein’s regime, and tossing it aside with-
out answering real questions about our 
ongoing efforts in the region is reck-
less. 
So let’s clear up some facts. The 2002 
AUMF has been understood for years— 
years—to apply to a variety of threats 
emanating from Iraq. Administrations 
of both parties have cited it as an im-
portant legal foundation of our fight 
against ISIS. It has been used precisely 
because 
the 
ISIS 
caliphate 
that 
stretched into Syria emanated from 
Iraq after President Obama’s with-
drawal in 2011. 
The 2002 AUMF is important in Iraq 
today because it provides authority for 
U.S. forces there to defend themselves 
from a variety of real, exigent threats. 
It is arguably even more important in 
Syria, where our personnel are present 
against the wishes of the brutal Assad 
regime, supporting local Kurdish and 
Arab forces and conducting strikes 
against ISIS. And because ISIS and al- 
Qaida have sometimes diverged, legal 
analysts have suggested that the 2001 
AUMF alone may be insufficient to au-
thorize operations against ISIS. 
Do supporters of this repeal fully un-
derstand the ways it might limit coun-
terterrorism 
missions? 
How 
about 
cyber ops? How about support for Kurd-
ish and Arab forces in Syria? How do 
they propose we respond to growing at-
tacks against our forces and interests 
in Iraq? 
What about the prospects for robust 
congressional oversight if the Presi-
dent is left to rely on unilateral article 
II authorities or even less transparent 
ones? We are learning a lesson in real 
time about withdrawing from Afghani-
stan without a plan. We shouldn’t 
make the same mistake here. So I sus-
pect this isn’t really about reasserting 
congressional 
oversight. 
After 
all, 
when 
the 
last 
administration 
an-
nounced plans to withdraw from Syria 
and Afghanistan in 2019, two dozen 
Democrats joined my amendment op-
posing the decision and reasserting our 
role in foreign policy. But now, many 
of our colleagues no longer want to 
talk about what we should be doing to 
confront these ongoing threats. 
A lot can happen in 2 years, I guess. 
The political winds have certainly 
changed. But one thing hasn’t changed: 
The grave threats posed by ISIS, al- 
Qaida, and other terrorist groups are as 
real as they have ever been, and repeal-
ing AUMFs without agreeing on a set 
of new authorities up front will only 
lead to more uncertainty about what 
we are going to do about them. 
For years, U.S. forces have been care-
fully handing more of the primary re-
sponsibilities for counterterrorism to 
brave local partners. Under the last ad-
ministration, this allowed our military 
footprint in Iraq and Syria to shrink 
dramatically. But the only reason that 
worked is because our partners have 
been able to trust that the U.S. mili-
tary is still authorized to back them 
up. Today, House Democrats intend to 
rip out one of the key authorities un-
derpinning that trust. 
As I understand it, Democrats don’t 
even intend to stop there. They are 
also planning to take aim at the 2001 
authorities that allow us to keep some 
of the most dangerous terrorists alive 
from taking more innocent American 
lives. The administration says it is 
looking into how best to close the de-
tention facility at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, that houses the absolute—abso-
lute—worst of the worst, including 
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the master-
mind of the September 11 attack. But 
thus far, the administration is rather 
short on details. How does the Presi-
dent plan to do this? Does he intend to 
break the law and bring terrorists to 
the United States? Give them expanded 
legal rights? Further radicalize our 
prison population? Talk about domes-
tic violent extremism. Or does the 
President intend to send KSM and his

Closing Guantanamo Bay will not 
make Americans safer. It will not bring 
solace to the victims of terrorism. It 
will not make America more respected

NOMINATION OF JOHN K. TIEN 
Mr. CARPER. Thank you, Madam 
President. I hope you are well today. 
Good to see you and our staff. 
I rise this morning to applaud the 
nomination of COL John Tien. He has 
been selected by our President to serve 
as the Deputy Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, a very big 
job and an important job. 
I have the honor of currently serving 
as the senior member and former chair-
man of the Senate Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs, which is responsible for, among 
other things, overseeing the operations 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE A. PETERS 
Madam President, very sadly, my 
colleague GARY
PETERS, who is the 
chairman of the Homeland Security 
Committee, lost his mom this week, 
and he cannot be with us today. Nor-
mally, he would be here speaking on 
behalf of the nomination of Colonel 
Tien. 
His mother, whom I know and per-
sonally and dearly—I have known her 
ever since Gary first joined us—she is a 
huge Detroit Tigers baseball fan, as am 
I. I had the pleasure of going with her 
to baseball games and considered her a 
kindred spirit. 
I just want to, literally, as we think 
about Senator PETERS and his family 
this morning—I just want to ask, 
maybe, for a moment of silence to re-
member her and the Peters family. 
Thank you. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
(Moment of silence.) 
NOMINATION OF JOHN K. TIEN 
Madam President, as many of our 
colleagues know, the Department of 
Homeland Security is still a fairly 
young Agency, created in response to 
the attacks on September 11, 2001. 
I vividly remember the tragic events 
of that day, a day as beautiful as 
today—sunshine, blue skies—and then 
the whole world changed, literally, 
while I was riding the train from Wil-
mington to Washington, DC. I recall 
also, vividly, how the Members of this 
body pulled together that day and our 
country pulled together that day. We, 
with the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, we, with the President George W. 
Bush, set aside partisan politics, and 
we created the 9/11 Commission and 
adopted the great majority of its rec-
ommendations. 
My recollection was the cochairs of 
the 9/11 Commission, former Governor 
of New Jersey, Tom Kean, a Repub-
lican, highly regarded, my neighbor 
across the river, and Lee Hamilton, 
Congressman from Indiana, who was 
chairman of the House Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, one of my mentors— 
he was a Congressman years ago—they 
led a group, the 9/11 Commission. I 
think they came to agreement unani-
mously on 42 recommendations, passed 
them off to what would become the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. We adopted al-
most every one of them unanimously, 
and it did a lot of good for our country 
and provided a lot of protection for our 
country, for our homeland. 
Among the recommendations that he 
made was the creation of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and the ex-
pansion of our committee’s jurisdiction 
to include homeland security. Before 
that, we were the Committee on Gov-
ernmental Affairs, which is important. 
It was an oversight committee. But 
with the addition of the Department of 
Homeland Security, that responsibility 
grew enormously. 
But since then, our committee has 
taken on a very different purpose. I am 
proud of the work that we have done 
that has made Americans safer today. 
As someone who was very much in-
volved in helping to stand up and as-
semble the Department of Homeland 
Security, I am proud of the way it has 
grown and matured over the last 20 
years. I remain convinced that it is, in 
large part, the leadership provided by 
the nominees we confirm in this Cham-
ber that enables the Department of 
Homeland Security to carry out suc-
cessfully as its many missions. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity is an Agency with a budget of over 
$50 billion and a staff of almost a quar-
ter million men and women who are 
collectively responsible for protecting 
our Nation from many of the threats 
that we face. From the clear and 
present threats of both foreign and do-
mestic terrorism to responding to 
cyber attacks on our critical infra-
structure, to helping distribute relief 
and assistance in the face of natural 
disasters, there is no shortage of work 
to be done by that Agency and the men 
and women who work there every sin-
gle day. 
I often say that leadership is the 
most important ingredient to the suc-
cess of almost any organization on this 
planet. In sports, in business, in gov-
ernment, our leaders set the tone at 
the top. They lead by their example, 
and they are the ones who guide their 
team to accomplish its mission, or, in 
the case of the Department of Home-
land Security, its many missions. That 
is why it is crucial that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security have Sen-
ate-confirmed, qualified leadership at 
its helm. 
After years in multiple administra-
tions leaving key Senate-confirmed 
posts vacant or held on an ‘‘Acting’’ 
capacity for far too long, this Depart-
ment needs qualified leaders now more 
than ever. 
It has been without a Senate-con-
firmed Deputy Secretary for over 3 
years. Let me repeat that. This vital 
Agency has been without a Senate-con-
firmed Deputy Secretary for more than 
3 years. That has to change. With the 
confirmation of COL John Tien to 
serve, this body can do something 
about it, and we can do it today. 
The responsibilities of the Deputy 
Secretary are daunting. Serving as a 
chief operating officer, the Deputy Sec-
retary of Homeland Security is respon-
sible for the day-to-day business of the 
Agency and the management of its op-
erations and 250,000 men and women. 
Colonel Tien is a proven leader and 
dedicated public servant. He is a re-
tired U.S. Army colonel, whose 24-year 
career includes three combat tours in 
Iraq and national security roles in the 
Clinton, the George W. Bush, and the 
Obama White Houses. He has worked 
hand in glove with people from dif-
ferent perspectives and commands the 
respect of Republicans and Democrats 
alike. 
For the past decade, COL Tien has 
been a leader in the private sector, 
where he has held senior executive 
roles in our Nation’s financial sector 
and managed complex organizations

His nomination has drawn bipartisan 
support. Dozens of national security 
leaders and experts, including several 
former military and civilian govern-
ment officials who served under Demo-
cratic and Republican Presidents, have 
expressed their strong support for Colo-
nel Tien’s nomination. 
Just a week ago, the Committee on

Affairs, on which I serve, advanced his

nomination by a wide margin—by a 
wide margin, bipartisan support. Given 
Colonel Tien’s past leadership experi-
ences, I am hopeful that the Depart-
ment will finally get the Senate-con-
firmed leader it needs and deserves in 
this critical post. 
The American people are counting on 
seasoned leadership at the Department 
of Homeland Security after too many 
years of vacancies. I describe those va-
cancies as Swiss cheese, executive 
branch Swiss cheese, and that needs to 
end. 
I applaud President Biden for nomi-
nating Colonel Tien. I encourage my 
colleagues to confirm him. 
Let me say on a personal note to 
Colonel Tien and his wife Tracy—and 
they have a couple of daughters, Aman-
da and Rebecca—when you serve, as he 
did in the military for 24 years, rising 
to the rank of colonel, you don’t just 
serve that as an individual. It is not 
just the officer or enlisted person who 
is serving. If they have a family—and 
we almost all do—the family serves as 
well. If they have a spouse, they have 
children, they serve as well. And we 
don’t often acknowledge that, not 
often enough, at least. 
I just want to take a moment to say 
to Colonel Tien’s wife Tracy, to their 
daughters, Amanda and Rebecca, we 
are grateful for your service as well. 
And we are honored and privileged that 
you would share a good man in this 
new role for our country. 
And to Colonel Tien, whose mother 
recently passed away, I understand, 
just a few months ago, from COVID–19, 
let me say that I know your mom must 
be looking down from on high today 
and feeling very proud of her son on 
this day and every day. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CENSORSHIP 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, at the 
end of May, Facebook announced that 
it would no longer censor claims that 
the coronavirus was man-made. The 
mainstream media, which had savaged 
the story during the previous adminis-
tration, suddenly started backpedaling, 
and the Biden White House, which had 
reportedly canceled the previous ad-
ministration’s 
investigation 
into 
whether the novel coronavirus origi-
nated in a Wuhan lab, announced a 90- 
day inquiry into the virus’s origins. 
The occasion for all this back-
pedaling was apparently a report in the 
Wall Street Journal that three re-
searchers who worked at Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology ‘‘sought hospital care’’ 
in late 2019 for symptoms consistent 
with the coronavirus. In the wake of 
that report, it became impossible for 
the President or the mainstream media 
or Facebook to deny what had always 
been a plausible theory: that the virus 
came from the virology lab in Wuhan. 
Journalists moved to explain their 
previous rejection of this theory, and 
some of them openly admitted what 
had been obvious: that they rejected 
the theory not because of flaws in the 
theory itself but because of those who 
had advanced this hypothesis. 
We don’t know what these revived in-
vestigations will ultimately show, but 
the Wuhan reversal illustrates multiple 
issues. One, of course, is the need to re-
member that our social media experi-
ence is heavily curated. The posts and 
ads we see are selected for us by com-
plex algorithms that analyze the data 
social media companies have collected 
on each of us and curate our experience 
accordingly. 
On top of that, as the past year or 
two has illustrated, social media com-
panies actively censor certain mate-
rial, meaning that there are posts we 
will never see. 
As chairman and now ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Commerce Commit-
tee’s Communications and Tech Sub-
committee, I have pushed for trans-
parency requirements for social media 
companies, and I have introduced two 
bipartisan bills that would increase 
internet transparency while preserving 
the light-touch approach to regulation 
that has allowed the internet to flour-
ish. 
My Filter Bubble Transparency Act 
would allow social media users to opt 
out of the filter bubble—in other 
words, to opt out of the filtered experi-
ence tailored for them by opaque algo-
rithms—and instead see an unfiltered 
social media feed or search results. 
The Platform Accountability and 
Transparency Act, which I introduced 
with Senator SCHATZ, would increase 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
around 
content 
moderation. 
Sites 
would be required to provide an easily 
digestible disclosure of their content 
moderation practices for users, and, 
importantly, they would be required to 
explain their decisions to remove ma-
terial to consumers. 
Under the PACT Act, if a site chose 
to remove your post, it would have to 
tell you why it decided to remove your 
post. The PACT Act would also require 
sites to have an appeals process. So if 
Facebook, for example, removed one of 
your posts, it would not only have to 
tell you why, but it would have to pro-
vide a way for you to appeal that deci-
sion. 
Let me be clear. Private entities are 
free to have their own opinions and 
viewpoints and should not be compelled 
by the government to publish alter-
native views, but that is not what we 
are talking about with these large so-
cial media platforms. Most strongly 
deny that they are publishers and in-
stead hold themselves forth as neutral 
platforms for the free exchange of ideas 
from all corners. That is the promise 
they make to consumers. 
The Wuhan reversal is more than a 
reminder that our social media experi-
ence is actually a heavily curated one. 
It also raises serious questions about 
censorship and the maintenance of the 
marketplace of ideas that is a hall-
mark of a free society. There is no free 
society without the free exchange of 
ideas. Freedom of speech, freedom of 
the press, freedom of religion, freedom 
to speak in the public square—all of 
these are essential elements of a free 
society. The more a government or 
other entities crack down on freedom 
of speech and the free exchange of 
ideas, the more we move away from a 
free society and toward tyranny. 
I say ‘‘or other entities’’ because the 
responsibility for protecting the free 
exchange of ideas extends beyond the 
government. Government, of course, 
has an absolute obligation to defend 
our fundamental freedoms, but other 
institutions in society also have a role. 
You can’t have a free society without 
free institutions. I am thinking here 
particularly of the press, universities, 
and in this day and age, social media 
companies. 
If the press or social media compa-
nies only sanction one narrative—the 
narrative preferred by the government 
or by social elites or by any other 
group—the 
marketplace 
of 
ideas 
shrinks 
substantially. 
If 
multiple 
groups that should be fostering the free 
exchange of ideas combine to limit or 
advance a particular narrative, they 
start to control public opinion instead 
of allowing individuals to form their 
own opinions based on a free flow of in-
formation. 
Unfortunately, as the Wuhan story 
illustrates, today we are seeing a real 
movement to restrict the free flow of 
ideas. Whether we are talking about 
speech codes or social media censor-
ship, more and more, we are seeing a 
preferred narrative being advanced and 
opinions outside of that preferred nar-
rative being censored or marginalized. 
We see it in government with bills 
like S. 1, which would, among other 
things, allow the IRS to consider an or-
ganization’s 
views 
before 
deciding 
whether or not to grant it tax-exempt 
status, or the Equality Act, which 
would crack down on freedom of speech 
and freedom of religion in unprece-
dented ways. We see it outside govern-
ment when media outlets engage in se-
lective reporting to highlight an ac-
cepted narrative instead of reporting 
the news and the facts, whatever they 
are, or when social media censors le-
gitimate theories or stories or when 
universities crack down on free speech. 
In the wake of the Wuhan lab story, 
we saw widespread censorship across 
government, social media, and the 
press for political reasons. President 
Biden seemingly shut down the former 
President’s 
investigation 
into 
the 
virus’s origin because it was the former 
President’s investigation. Democrats 
in Congress pressured social media 
companies to censor information that 
contradicted the narrative that they

were 
embracing. 
The 
mainstream 
media savaged the lab origin story. So-
cial media sites censored it. And all of 
this happened because of the political 
affiliation of the people advancing this 
reasonable hypothesis. 
You can only have a marketplace of 
ideas if ideas actually get out there, 
which is why censorship, as I have said, 
is antithetical to a free society. It is 
also important to note—and this is a 
critical, critical point—that having a 
free marketplace of ideas means allow-
ing some ideas that might be wrong, 
that might seem offensive, that might 
seem silly. We are not talking about 
content that, for example, promotes vi-
olence but ideas that are provocative, 
debatable, or out of the mainstream. 
The alternative is allowing the govern-
ment or some other entity to decide 
what information we see and what we 
believe. 
It is important to remember that 
sometimes ideas that seem silly or 
wrong initially turn out to be right. 
More than one widely accepted sci-
entific theory started out as a fringe 
position. A prevailing opinion may 
turn out to be wrong, and political or 
social power doesn’t necessarily equal 
truth. 
I hope that their abrupt reversal on 
COVID’s possible origins makes media 
organizations and social media plat-
forms think twice the next time they 
consider censoring a story. I hope it re-
minds them of the dangers of restrict-
ing the free flow of ideas and of their 
obligation to separate their politics 
from their jobs. 
In a speech he delivered in 1967, Ron-
ald Reagan, marveling at our govern-
ment by the people, said this: 
Perhaps you and I have lived too long with 
this miracle to properly be appreciative. 
Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never 
more than one generation away from extinc-
tion. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it 
must be fought for and defended constantly 
by each generation, for it comes only once to 
a people. 
I fear that long acquaintance with 
the blessings of liberty—with the bless-
ings of a free press and freedom of 
speech and freedom of religion—has 
sometimes made us careless about the 
preservation of these freedoms. We are 
used to them, and we assume that they 
will always be with us. But, as Ronald 
Reagan pointed out, freedom has to be 
actively safeguarded, or it will be lost. 
I have seen too many instances lately 
where our cherished First Amendment 
freedoms are subordinated to a polit-
ical and social agenda, and I hope, I 
hope that the Wuhan story reminds us 
of the responsibility that each one of 
us has to safeguard these freedoms, lest 
they slip away from us. 
BROADBAND 
Mr. President, on Tuesday, the Com-
merce subcommittee of which I am the 
ranking member, the Subcommittee on 
Communications, 
Media, 
and 
Broadband, will hold a hearing on 
building resilient broadband networks. 
My hope is that this hearing will help 
inform discussions of broadband fund-
ing in any infrastructure legislation. 
I am particularly looking forward to 
hearing from Denny Law, the CEO of 
Golden West Telecommunications in 
South Dakota, who will speak on the 
challenges of deploying reliable and re-
silient broadband in rural areas. 
The pandemic provided the most sig-
nificant test to date of the resiliency of 
our broadband networks. Overnight, 
quite literally, our networks faced 
huge new demands. As the Nation 
locked down, demand for broadband 
shot up. Our phones and tablets and 
laptops became our main way of com-
municating with friends and family 
and, for many of us, our main way of 
doing our jobs. Video conferencing ex-
ploded—staff meetings, strategy meet-
ings, virtual happy hours, telemedi-
cine. 
How did our networks stand up to the 
demand? Well, they exceeded expecta-
tions and vindicated the light-touch 
regulatory approach of the United 
States to broadband policy. While net-
works in Europe and elsewhere slowed 
streaming speeds in order to keep their 
networks up and running, U.S. net-
works maintained both their speed and 
quality. It was a real American success 
story. 
The success of American networks 
during the pandemic was the result of 
sustained investment by U.S. tele-
communications 
companies, 
which 
have made network reliability a pri-
ority. Congress should continue to en-
courage this kind of private invest-
ment and maintain a regulatory re-
gime that allows companies to make 
the kinds of choices and investments 
that have resulted in strong and resil-
ient U.S. networks. 
Going forward, one of our priorities 
here in Congress has to be supporting 
the continued development of 5G. U.S. 
companies are already building out 5G 
networks, but there is more work to be 
done. We need to remove regulatory 
and permitting hurdles to deployment 
and ensure that companies have access 
to the spectrum they need to build 
strong networks. 
Increasing spectrum availability will 
spur 5G deployments, and we need to 
build on previous efforts to make spec-
trum available, like my MOBILE NOW 
Act, legislation that we passed a few 
years ago. I have also repeatedly intro-
duced legislation called the STREAM-
LINE Small Cell Deployment Act to 
address another key part of the 5G 
equation, and that is infrastructure. 
Mr. President, 5G technology re-
quires not just traditional cell phone 
towers 
but 
small 
antennas 
called 
‘‘small cells’’ that can often be at-
tached to existing infrastructure, like 
utility poles or buildings. The Federal 
Communications 
Commission, 
under 
Chairman Pai, modernized its regula-
tions for the approval of small cells, 
but more work can be done to expedite 
small cell deployment. 
The STREAMLINE Act focuses on 
updating current law to better reflect 
emerging technology and to speed up 
permitting while respecting the role of 
State and local governments in making 
deployment decisions. 
Adequate spectrum and the ability to 
efficiently deploy infrastructure are es-
sential for building out strong U.S. 5G 
networks. But there is another key 
part of the equation, and that is having 
a sufficient workforce to meet the de-
mands of 5G deployment and, later, 5G 
maintenance. That is why I have intro-
duced the Telecommunications Skilled 
Workforce Act. My bill would help in-
crease the number of workers enrolled 
in 5G training programs and identify 
ways to grow the telecommunications 
workforce to meet the demands of 5G. 
As the resident of a rural State, ex-
panding broadband access in rural 
areas has long been a priority of mine 
here in the U.S. Senate. We have made 
a lot of progress in recent years, but 
there is more work to be done. 
I 
recently 
introduced 
the 
Rural 
Connectivity 
Advancement 
Program 
Act, along with Senators HASSAN, 
MORAN, and CORTEZ MASTO. Our legis-
lation would set aside proceeds from 
spectrum auctions conducted by the 
FCC 
to 
build 
out 
broadband 
in 
unserved areas. It is essential that we 
expedite 
the 
deployment 
of 
fixed 
broadband in rural areas because this 
technology is necessary groundwork 
for 5G deployment. Without reliable 
broadband, rural areas will be excluded 
from access to 5G. 
Reliable, fast internet is an essential 
element of our Nation’s infrastructure. 
Like roads and bridges and railways 
and airports, strong internet networks 
keep our economy strong, and any in-
frastructure package should make an 
investment in broadband and 5G, as 
well as including regulatory relief, like 
that in my STREAMLINE Act, to expe-
dite 5G deployment. However, we need 
to make sure that any Federal money 
is allocated in the most efficient man-
ner possible and distributed respon-
sibly, with coordination by expert 
Agencies like the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, to prevent waste. 
We don’t want another situation like 
what happened in the wake of the 2009 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act, which provided more than $7 bil-
lion to multiple Agencies for rural 
broadband deployment, a majority of 
which was wasted, resulting in just a 
fraction of the access that was prom-
ised. 
I am looking forward to Tuesday’s 
hearing, and I will continue to work to 
advance nationwide 5G deployment and 
ensure that our rural communities re-
ceive the full benefits of the 5G revolu-
tion. 
I yield the floor.

jority whip. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1652

lives to providing comprehensive serv-
ices for the survivors of domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault. 
Every day they respond to horrifying 
cases of abuse. They help thousands of 
women and children access the support 
they need to address trauma and to re-
build their lives. 
For example, Life Span recently as-
sisted a woman after her teenage 
daughter was sexually assaulted by the 
woman’s husband. Life Span was able 
to help the mother and daughter navi-
gate the overwhelming challenges of 
pursuing justice against the abuser and 
offer support to the daughter through-
out this horrible process. 
When the mother pursued a divorce 
from the abuser, Life Span filed a peti-
tion and is representing the mother as 
she navigates issues of child support 
and allocation of custody. 
The three Life Span staffers that the 
mother and daughter have interacted 
with all provided critical bilingual and 
bicultural support. They have provided 
this crucial service for this family dur-
ing an incredibly traumatic experience. 
And all three of these staffers are fund-
ed by assistance provided through the 
Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA. Life 
Span told me that without VOCA fund-
ing, ‘‘none of these personnel . . . 
would be able to have done this job.’’ 
Congress passed the Victims of Crime 
Act in 1984 to establish the Crime Vic-
tims Fund. This fund provides grants 
to State victim compensation and as-
sistance programs, which assist vic-
tims with expenses like medical bills, 
funeral expenses, and the loss of wages 
during recovery. 
How often I have heard Members of 
Congress come to the floor and in com-
mittee speak about the plight of the 
victims of crime. This is an effort—an 
overt effort by Congress—to make sure 
that we are there when they des-
perately need us. 
The fund also provides funds to thou-
sands of victims service providers, like 
Life Span, across the Nation. These 
providers offer programs serving vic-
tims of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk driving. 
The Crime Victims Fund doesn’t re-
ceive a dime of taxpayer dollars. How 
about that? It is funded through crimi-
nal 
fines, 
penalties, 
forfeited 
bail 
bonds, and special assessments col-
lected by the Federal Government. 
Historically, most of the money in 
the fund comes from those criminal 
fines. But in recent years, deposits into 
the fund have dropped significantly, as 
the Justice Department began relying 
more on deferred prosecutions and non-
prosecution agreements. 
Monetary penalties from these de-
ferred prosecutions and nonprosecution 
agreements are currently deposited 
into the general Treasury instead of 
this fund, and, as a result, this shift 
has had a devastating impact on the 
fund and the services available to 
crime victims in America. 
That is why a bipartisan, bicameral 
coalition 
of 
Members 
of 
Congress 
worked with the advocacy organiza-
tions on a fix to the VOCA law to sus-
tain the Crime Victims Fund. 
Our bill would stabilize the depleted 
fund by redirecting monetary penalties 
from deferred prosecutions and non-
prosecution agreements to the victims 
and service providers that desperately 
need help. 
The reduced deposits into the fund 
have already had a devastating impact. 
Victim assistance grants have been re-
duced by more than $600 million in 
2021, and more cuts are looming if we 
don’t do something. 
The executive director of Life Span 
in Chicago told me that VOCA funds 44 
percent of the agency’s services—about 
$1.6 million annually. A substantial 
loss in VOCA funds would mean that 
they would have to cut back staff who 
provide legal services, affecting an es-
timated 880 clients. 
Life Span is not alone. Advocates 
across the State of Illinois and across 
the country have reached out and 
shared what these cuts would mean for 
their agencies and the victims they 
serve. 
The Center for Prevention of Abuse 
in Peoria, IL, noted: 
We never want to be in a position where we 
are made to turn away people who need [our] 
specialized services and whole-hearted, dedi-
cated care. Our teams are already stretched 
thin as they live the promise of our mission 
day in and day out. Fewer VOCA dollars 
means less staff and a lessened ability to 
help those who need to find safety, food, 
shelter, empowerment, freedom, and peace. 
There is no time to waste. Every day 
that goes by, we miss an opportunity 
to help replenish this fund. In 2021, the 
fund has already missed out on ap-
proximately $400 million in deposits. 
We are not even halfway through the 
year. Imagine how much more money 
the fund may lose if we don’t do some-
thing. 
That is why it is imperative that the 
Senate immediately pass this bill. The 
House already did it in March, with 
broad bipartisan support, and here in 
the Senate we have a bipartisan coali-
tion of 56 Senators—36 Democrats and 
20 Republicans—cosponsoring the legis-
lation. We could send this bill to the 
President’s desk today. We should have 
sent it to him weeks ago. Unfortu-
nately, there is an objection that has 
prevented us from moving forward. 
In a recent letter to Leader SCHUMER, 
victims’ rights and law enforcement or-
ganizations said that, ‘‘The objectors 
are, in effect, holding victim services 
hostage in an ideological quest to over-
haul the Appropriations process by 
eliminating budgetary offsets.’’ 
What a target to choose if you want 
to change the procedure of the com-
mittee—crime victims? 
I agree with the National Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence and so 
many other groups. More than 1,700 
that are begging us to do something 
and stop holding this critical legisla-
tion. 
The passage of this legislation today 
would ensure that victims are able to 
maintain these critical services. Don’t 
we owe it to them after the promise of 
help to come through? 
At this point, I would like to turn to 
my colleague Senator MURKOWSKI. 
And I ask unanimous consent that 
Senators MURKOWSKI, TOOMEY, and I be 
able to complete our remarks prior to 
the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
want to acknowledge and thank my 
colleague and friend from Illinois for 
his leadership on this issue. He has out-
lined well the situation in front of us 
with regard to the status of the Crime 
Victims Fund. 
Again, this is a nontaxpayer source 
of funding, which is designed to help 
the millions of victims of crimes— 
those who have been violated, those 
who are extraordinarily vulnerable. 
And we are at a place where, as he has 
indicated, we have a proposal here that 
could help address how this fund is re-
plenished to, again, ensure that those 
who have been made victims can re-
ceive some level of compensation. 
We are kind of stuck here this morn-
ing, which is extraordinarily unfortu-
nate. Folks back home in Alaska are 
just starting their day, and they are 
looking with anticipation and hope 
and, quite honestly, prayers that today 
might be the day that they get good 
news on this. 
Right now, I have about 30 organiza-
tions in Alaska, including our domestic 
violence shelters, our child advocacy 
centers, our victim advocacy organiza-
tions—they have all been notified that 
they are going to expect a 35-percent 
cut to their funding, effective the 1st of 
July, so just in a couple of weeks here. 
And because of this broken VOCA de-
posit issue, this cut is set to affect 
their funds for not only this year but 
for next year going forward. 
So think about it. You are the shel-
ter in Kodiak, where I was just 6, 8 
weeks or so ago. When you are told you 
have a 35-percent cut to your budget 
coming and you have a small commu-
nity, where are you going to find those 
resources? Because, believe you, me, 
the individuals who still require those 
services are not staying at home and 
saying: Well, I guess we didn’t have the 
services here on this big island of Ko-
diak; so I am just going to stay put. 
The need is still there. In fact, the 
need is more enhanced or exacerbated 
than ever before. We have seen this as 
a follow-on from COVID. We have seen 
those 
aftereffects, 
that 
aftershock, 
when you have been in an isolated situ-
ation where you have been forced to 
kind of shelter in place, if you will, but 
your home is not a safe shelter. It is 
not a shelter in that sense of the word. 
But you don’t have services. And so 
where do you go? You stay with your 
abuser. You stay in the situation that 
is unsound, unsafe, because you don’t 
have anyplace to turn. So the need out 
there is considerable.

June 17, 2021 
We had a situation last summer of 
devastating loss, with five village resi-
dents in different villages who had died 
in domestic violence murders over a 
course of 10 days. These are small vil-
lages where everybody knows every-
body, and the loss of one person—an 
elder, a child, or a victim—is extraor-
dinary. And so we looked at that, and 
we said: Well, that is exacerbated by 
COVID and what has happened. 
But, no, this has been a situation for 
us long prior to COVID, in terms of, un-
fortunately, the levels that we see of 
domestic violence, sexual assault, the 
victimization that we see—so being 
there to provide funding for services to 
help prevent these deaths, the trauma 
that children experience when they are 
in the room, the murders that affect 
families for generations. There is a 
story in the news just today—a domes-
tic situation, the husband and the wife. 
The husband took the wife’s life and 
then took his own, and it was a 6-year- 
old with an iPad who notified the au-
thorities. 
I think about the reality of what a 
35-percent cut means, what it means 
when you say your service providers 
are faced with $6 million less in fund-
ing for victims services. The shelters 
are calling out to us for help. One do-
mestic violence shelter in the State is 
facing the reality of laying off six full- 
time jobs within their organization. 
This is unacceptable. 
I understand that there are concerns. 
Senator TOOMEY is going to speak to 
them. But this legislation doesn’t 
change how Federal tax money is 
spent. It provides a technical fix by di-
recting additional nontaxpayer dollars 
from criminal monetary penalties into 
this fund. So we are sitting at a point 
where the longer that Congress delays 
this fix, the larger the cuts that vic-
tims services in my State and all 
around the country will face. 
This has been a hard time for us, and 
I think we recognize it, but for those 
who are trying to serve victims, for 
those who are trying to serve the most 
vulnerable at an exceptionally vulner-
able time in their lives, it makes it 10 
times harder. Our providers are ex-
hausted, they are burned out, and now 
they are faced with massive cuts. We 
simply cannot fail them. 
I would urge us to look past the poli-
tics on this. This is what these victims’ 
advocates are saying: Please don’t use 
us as the political lever here. So I join 
not only with Senator DURBIN but with 
the many in this body who would urge 
that we pass this technical fix to 
VOCA. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Alaska for 
her heartfelt remarks. 
There are innocent people who are 
victims of domestic violence whose 
fate depends on what we do right here 
and now. This is an important budg-
etary debate that the Senator from 
Pennsylvania is raising. I ask, please 
don’t use these people in this desperate 
situation as a pressure point. Let’s try 
to reconcile this on a rational basis 
without jeopardizing them. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 1652, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk; fur-
ther, that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, let me say 
I think I agree with 98, 99 percent of 
what I just heard from my colleagues. 
In the 11 years I have been in the 
Senate, I have lost track of how many 
rape crisis centers and how many child 
advocacy centers I have visited. They 
have expanded the number, fortu-
nately, because they have gotten addi-
tional resources from Congress. They 
do some of the most important work I 
know of—incredibly painful work—in 
helping a child through an appalling, 
traumatic experience when there is a 
law enforcement need to get informa-
tion that can further traumatize a 
child. I mean, the work these folks do 
is amazing, it is essential, and the Sen-
ator from Alaska is exactly right in 
that there is a real need here. 
The good news is that there is a real, 
very clear, and easy path forward here. 
The legislation that the Senator from 
Illinois is proposing creates a new 
source of money for the Crime Victims 
Fund. It is a new category, it is sub-
stantial, and it is going to be new re-
sources for the advocates for crime vic-
tims to better be able to continue to do 
their very, very important work, and I 
fully support that. 
So where do we disagree? Here is 
where we disagree: The legislation does 
require a lot of money—new money—to 
go into the Crime Victims Fund. The 
Senator from Illinois is exactly correct 
in that it is not taxpayer money; it is 
money from the settlements for crimi-
nal and civil penalties. I fully support 
that. What their legislation doesn’t do, 
however, is require a dime of that 
money to actually get to the advocates 
of crime. It is very nice to put a lot of 
money into an account that has a 
name on it that is the Crime Victims 
Fund. That is very nice, and I support 
that, but I would like to take one more 
step and make sure the money actually 
gets to the victims of crime and their 
advocates. 
Now, there is a little bit of budgetary 
information that explains why, if we 
don’t adopt my approach here, this 
money will not get to the victims of 
crime and their advocates. You see, the 
appropriations process, the spending 
process around here, always operates 
under some limit. It could be a statu-
tory limit or a limit passed by a budget 
resolution, but there is a limit. There 
is no limit as to how much people want 
to spend around here, but there is a 
limit as to how much they actually 
can. 
We have a very perverse budgetary 
rule, and that rule says that, in any 
given year, if there is money in this 
Crime Victims Fund—mind you, not 
tax dollars, but if there is money in 
it—and Congress doesn’t give it to the 
crime victims as it is supposed to, you 
can pretend that it is a savings, and it 
allows you to spend more than you 
would otherwise be able to spend on 
any number of other things, on any-
thing—tanks, buildings, roads, what-
ever. That is the dynamic. That is 
what happens here. It actually creates 
an incentive, however perverse this is, 
for Congress not to allocate this money 
to the victims of crime and to their ad-
vocates. By not doing so, they get to 
claim a savings which isn’t real—but 
that is the way the budget rules work— 
and spend that money elsewhere. 
Now, you might say: Well, who would 
do a thing like that? Oh. Ha. Well, it 
used to happen all the time. In 2014, 
there was $9 billion available in the 
Crime Victims Fund, but in order to 
spend more money elsewhere, less than 
$1 billion was actually allocated to vic-
tims of crime and their advocates, so 
they got $8 billion of difference that 
they could spend on whatever else they 
wanted, and they did. In 2013, it was 
the same story. 
This was going on routinely until 
2015 when I and some of my colleagues 
said: Wait a minute. This isn’t right. 
This money is supposed to be going to 
crime victims, and it is not. 
That is the first and most objection-
able problem. It is also dishonest be-
cause there is no savings of taxpayer 
money here; this is just not giving 
crime victims the money from crimi-
nals that they are supposed to get. It is 
outrageous. 
For a while, we got some coopera-
tion, and they did less of this. In other 
words, more of the money that was 
supposed to go to crime victims for a 
while did, in fact, go there. But I am 
very concerned—and I have been con-
cerned since 2015—that, at any point in 
time, we will go back to this process. 
So I introduced legislation called the 
Fairness for Crime Victims Act. I in-
troduced it in 2015. What it does is it 
just requires that the money going into 
the fund actually go to the victims of 
crime and their advocates, and there 
are various mechanisms for doing it. 
The bill was reported out of the Senate 
Budget Committee in 2015, and it was 
unanimously adopted by the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2019. 
I have been working as closely as I 
can with the appropriators to address 
this so that we will actually send to 
crime victims the money that is sup-
posed to go to them. Since 2000, over 
$82 billion of money has not been allo-
cated to crime victims, as it should 
have been, precisely because of this 
mechanism. 
Some might say: Well, hasn’t it got-
ten better? Yes. The answer is that it 
has. But how do I know it is going to 
get worse? How do I know we are going 
to go right back to this? I will tell you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4607 
June 17, 2021 
how I know. All I have to do is read the 
President’s budget. 
President Biden’s budget, if you look 
at table S–8, explicitly calls for with-
holding money from victims of crime 
and advocates for those victims from 
the Crime Victims Fund and also the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
so as to spend more money in other 
areas. It is right here: ‘‘changes in 
mandatory program offsets: $26 bil-
lion.’’ It says the limitation enacted 
will come from the Crime Victims 
Fund program and cancelations in the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
This is not like wild speculation; this 
is President Biden’s budget, saying: Oh, 
here is what I want to spend, and part 
of how I will spend it—part of how we 
will 
get 
there—is 
by 
withholding 
money that should be going to victims 
of crime. 
So I am fully in support of this new 
allocation of money into the account, 
but money in the account doesn’t solve 
the problem. We need one more step, 
that is all—the step that says we are 
actually going to send it to victims of 
crime instead of whatever spending 
people in this town decide they prefer. 
That is what this is about. That is 
what the difference is. 
We have developed a process. We 
have worked with people on both sides 
of the aisle, and we have passed legisla-
tion in committee to do it. We want to 
simply require the money that is 
meant for victims of crime and their 
advocates to get to them, and we are 
being told it won’t all get to them 
under the status quo. 
There is a simple solution here. 
There is a simple path forward. I think 
there is a genuine, sincere agreement, 
among everybody who has spoken, 
about the need for this service. All I 
am asking is that we actually have a 
mechanism to get them the money 
rather than to do what we all know is 
coming: Pretend they are going to get 
all of this money when, in fact, it is 
going to be diverted to other purposes. 
Therefore, I ask that the Senator 
modify his request to include my 
amendment, which is at the desk; that 
it be considered and agreed to; that the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the modification? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I am dis-
appointed that the Senator from Penn-
sylvania is adamant in his position, 
even though we are dealing with vic-
tims of crime, victims of domestic vio-
lence, and victims of child abuse. Like 
Illinois, Pennsylvania has experienced 
a nearly 70-percent cut in VOCA fund-
ing since 2018, and more cuts are on the 
horizon because of his strategy. 
Here is what it boils down to: If you 
listen carefully to what the Senator 
from Pennsylvania has said, he is not 
suggesting that the money is being 
spent for other purposes but is sug-
gesting that it could be. In fact, there 
is a conscious effort by the Appropria-
tions subcommittee to make sure, if all 
of the money is not spent in 1 year, 
that enough will be maintained to sta-
bilize the fund for future years. That is 
thoughtful, and that is what we like to 
hear, but we are in a desperate moment 
now wherein we need the money and 
need it at this moment. 
I understand my colleague’s concern 
about the scorekeeping in the budget. 
It is an important issue, even though it 
is esoteric. But to do it in relation to 
the Crime Victims Fund seems entirely 
misplaced. While this adjustment does 
not, in fact, transfer money from the 
fund to other priorities, it is just a 
budgeting gimmick that he is sug-
gesting. 
This is not the right place or time to 
do this when thousands of people 
across the United States are in des-
perate need of shelter to get out of an 
abusive home; of help for their children 
who have witnessed murders; and of 
dealing with court proceedings that 
may be unintelligible to the average 
person to try to protect their families 
and themselves. To think that we are 
engaged in this high-level budget de-
bate at this moment at their expense is 
just not right. 
I urge my colleague to withdraw his 
amendment and allow the legislation 
to proceed. We can debate the budget 
within the budget resolution and the 
appropriations process but not at the 
expense of crime victims across Amer-
ica. If he will not withdraw his amend-
ment, I must object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I will just 
say briefly that, clearly and certainly, 
this is not a scorekeeping debate, and 
this is not about budgets. This is about 
whether victims of crime and their ad-
vocates will actually get the money 
that we say they are going to get. It is 
not about what could be; it is about 
what has been. This money was rou-
tinely raided for other purposes until 
we brought a stop to it recently, and it 
is about what will be because the Biden 
administration is telling us it intends 
to do this. 
In order to ensure that crime victims 
and their advocates actually get the 
money that we say they are going to 
get, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
VOTE ON BEAUDREAU NOMINATION 
Under the previous order, the ques-
tion is, Will the Senate advise and con-
sent to the Beaudreau nomination? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of John K. Tien, 
of Georgia, to be Deputy Secretary of 
Homeland Security. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed to complete my remarks prior to 
the recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise again to call for this entire body to 
vote and consider the Military Justice 
Improvement and Increasing Preven-
tion Act. This commonsense reform 
would ensure that people in the U.S. 
military who have been subjected to 
sexual assault and other serious crimes 
get the justice that they deserve. 
I began calling for the full floor vote 
on this bill on May 24. That was 24 days 
ago. Since then, an estimated 1,344 
servicemembers will have been raped 
or sexually assaulted. Two in three of 
those survivors will not even report it 
because they know that they are more 
likely to face retaliation than receive 
justice. 
This is a scourge that we have been 
looking at for over 8 years. We have 
passed nearly 250 measures to address 
sexual assault in the military, to ad-
dress retaliation, to address preven-
tion, and none of them have dented the 
numbers. In fact, our estimated cases 
are at about 20,000 cases, and among 
those, only about 200 have gone to 
courts-martial and ended in conviction. 
It is not enough. We aren’t moving the 
numbers in the right direction. They 
are, in fact, going in the wrong direc-
tion. 
We also have a reform that we have 
looked at for 8 years. It creates a 
bright line at all serious crimes to han-
dle two issues: one, the bias we see in 
sexual assault in the military; that if 
you are a servicemember who reports 
sexual assault, it is unlikely that you 
will get justice, and it is likely that 
you will be retaliated against. 
And after we have made retaliation a 
crime three times in a row, we have 
only seen one court-martial for retalia-
tion. That is outrageous. 
And so now is the time that we bring 
this measure to the floor. It does not 
cost a lot of money. It is something 
that uses the existing infrastructure, 
the existing lawyers, the existing infra-
structure around the lawyers. 
Two, it does not take a long time to 
implement because, in fact, after the 
military police complete their inves-
tigation and have their recommenda-
tion, basically, they send that rec-
ommendation to the prosecutor, as op-
posed to the commander. So after the 
review by the prosecutor, it goes right 
back to the commander if that pros-
ecutor declines to prosecute. 
So, ultimately, it changes the system 
in a very small but powerful way, and 
the reason why this change is rec-
ommended by all military experts is 
three reasons: One, the bright line cre-
ates a justice system for all plaintiffs 
and all defendants. And since we have 
bias with regard to women in the mili-
tary and we have bias with regard to 
Black and Brown servicemembers, this 
change will remove bias and profes-
sionalize the system for everyone. 
Second, our allies have done this. Our 
allies have done it—UK, Israel, Ger-
many, Australia, Netherlands. They 
have done it over the last 40 years for 
defendants’ rights, to make sure we 
have a system that is fair to everyone. 
When they put this change in place, 
they reported to our panel that, No. 1, 
they saw no diminution in command 
control; and, No. 2, they saw no under-
mining of good order and discipline. So 
for those reasons, that is why we need 
to pursue this legislation, a bright line. 
And then, last is the question that 
the chairman always raises, that this 
must go through the committee. The 
committee has been looking at this for 
8 years. We have had multiple hearings 
on this topic. We have had the data. We 
have talked about it with every service 
Secretary for the last decade I have 
been on the committee. We have talked 
about it with each of the services for 
the last decade that I have been on the 
committee, and we have tried to get a 
vote on this measure, unsuccessfully, 
for the past 5 years. We have been de-
nied a vote every time in the last 5 
years. 
So to say now that only the com-
mittee can have jurisdiction is not 
true. They have had their chance, and 
they have passed close to 250 measures. 
Those measures have not moved the 
needle. Those measures are ones that 
the DOD was comfortable with. They 
have never wanted this measure. Now 
we have agreement by the chairman, 
by this panel, by many of the service 
Secretaries that, OK, fine, we are with 
you; we will take sexual assault out of 
the chain of command. 
While that is good, it is not enough 
because it will create two systems of 
justice, and you should not privilege 
just one set of plaintiffs to have a posi-
tive, professional, unbiased system. 
And given all of the data we have 
about race and bias against Black serv-
icemembers and Brown servicemem-
bers being punished up to 2.5 times 
more than White servicemembers, you 
need to fix the system for everybody. 
So back to the argument of our al-
lies, that is why they did their bright 
line at serious crimes—the equivalent 
of felonies—so that they could have a 
justice system that is worthy of the 
sacrifices that the men and women in 
our armed services make. 
So I ask once again that we can have 
a vote on this floor. We now have 66 co-
sponsors of this legislation, widely bi-
partisan. How many bills in this Cham-
ber are supported by LIZ WARREN and 
TED CRUZ at the same time? How many 
pieces of legislation have been voted on 
by both CHUCK
SCHUMER
and MITCH 
MCCONNELL? Very few. But the reason 
we have such bipartisan support is we 
have two female command veterans in 
this body. One is a Republican, JONI 
ERNST. One is a Democrat, TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH. They are both on this leg-
islation. They have served as com-
manders, and they understand the im-
portance of the commander’s roles. But 
they also have seen that nothing has 
gotten better. They saw the report 
from Fort Hood that said the command 
climate was so toxic that it was per-
missible for sexual assault and sexual 
harassment. And so they have said 
enough is enough. 
And so when you have so many 
former commanders and sexual assault 
survivors 
from 
this 
Chamber

porting this legislation, it is time that

it does not need to go through the com-
mittee. More than half of our com-
mittee supports this. But when we take 
issues like this to the committee, they 
have been taken out in conference. 
Despite winning the vote in the Sen-
ate, despite winning the vote in the 
House, our bill in 2019 to make sure 
that a servicemember could come for-
ward and not be prosecuted for minor 
related offenses, like drinking or being 
off base—that bill passed in the Senate, 
passed in the House, and was taken out 
in conference because the DOD didn’t 
like it. 
So I promise you, if we pass this bill 
in our committee, in the House and the 
Senate—I promise you—it would be 
narrowed just down to sexual assault 
because that is what the DOD will 
agree to. 
I am tired of doing only what the 
DOD will agree to. It is not our job to 
defer to the DOD. It is our job as U.S. 
Senators to provide oversight and ac-
countability over the administration 
and over the entire Department of De-
fense. 
When we abdicate that responsi-
bility, what we have is what we had for 
the last 10 years, failure—failure in the 
committee because we only put for-
ward items the DOD was comfortable 
with. 
I just don’t know how much longer 
we want survivors to have to wait. We 
have considered this legislation to-
gether. We have, every year, sat down, 
discussed it—pros, cons. Are other re-
forms working? 
I have done that with every one of 
the 100 Senators in this Chamber every 
year for the last 10 years. It has been 
intensely considered, and I spend an 
extra amount of time with committee 
members because they are interested. 
So this is not new. It doesn’t need to 
go through the committee. We have 
been denied a vote and filibustered a 
vote for 8 years and denied a vote for 
the last 5 years. So I don’t know why 
the committee gets sole jurisdiction. I 
don’t understand. 
And, again, how many measures does 
this Chamber have that have 66 cospon-
sors? 
It is also a generational shift. And 
when you have something of such im-
port, it comes to the floor. We repealed 
don’t ask, don’t tell on the floor. We 
had two floor votes. The majority lead-
er at the time gave us those votes, and 
it passed on the floor. It did not go 
through the committee. 
It is time to bring a justice system 
that is worthy of the sacrifice that the 
men and women make every day. And 
you need to have that bright line so it 
is a justice system that works for 
women and servicemembers of color be-
cause right now we have data and evi-
dence that there is bias against those 
individuals. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Committee 
on Armed Services be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours of debate, equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate vote on the bill with no in-
tervening action or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, 
I object to the request from the Sen-
ator from New York for the reasons I 
previously stated. I will repeat again: I 
support removing prosecution of sexual 
assault and related crimes from the 
chain of command, but we must take 
care that we do it thoughtfully, in a 
manner that does not stress the mili-
tary justice system or distort it in a 
way that would affect the efficiency 
and operation of the military. The best 
way to do that, in my view, is to con-
sider these matters in the context of 
the annual Defense bill, which we will 
be marking up in a month. 
Mr. President, I would also point out 
that this week, Jeh Johnson, who 
served under President Obama as the 
Department of Defense general counsel, 
and then Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, wrote an article addressing the 
scope of Senator GILLIBRAND’s bill, urg-
ing caution that we focus on legislative 
solutions tailored to address the prob-
lem we are trying to solve. And to re-
mind my colleagues, as the DOD gen-
eral 
counsel, 
Secretary 
Johnson 
oversaw all legal services performed 
within the Department of Defense. He 
advised the Secretary and all govern-
ment officials on military justice mat-
ters and oversaw the annual review of 
the Manual for Courts-Martial. He is 
an informed and expert voice on these 
matters. 
During his tenure as DOD general 
counsel, he was no stranger to momen-
tous change, leading the implementa-
tion of the repeal of don’t ask, don’t 
tell. As he states in his article, he has 
long supported moving charging deci-
sions over sex offenses out of the chain 
of command. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
article. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From LAWFARE, June 16, 2021] 
THE MILITARY JUSTICE IMPROVEMENT AND IN-
CREASING PREVENTION ACT: ARE THE SOLU-
TIONS COMMENSURATE WITH THE PROBLEM? 
(By Jeh Johnson) 
The Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act of 2021 is legislation 
pending in Congress to reshape the manner 
in which the U.S. military prosecutes sexual 
assault within its ranks. This is reform that 
is much needed and long overdue. Notably, 
however, the bill in its current form reshapes 
military justice far beyond the context of 
sexual assault. Congress should take care to 
fashion a solution commensurate with the 
problem at hand, and not go too far. 
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D–NY), the 
principal sponsor of the bill, S. 1520, deserves 
credit for her heroic and persistent campaign 
over the years to highlight the problem of 
sexual assault in the military. Few others in 
Congress today could have assembled such a 
broad bipartisan coalition of 64 co-sponsors 
behind such an important, substantive piece 
of legislation, while moving (or, to put it 
more appropriately, dragging) the top brass 
at the Pentagon to the same place. From my 
experience 10 years ago preparing the mili-
tary for the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, 
I know how resistant to change that commu-
nity can be. 
I support Senator Gillibrand’s effort to 
move charging decisions for sex offenses in 
the military to an independent, trained 
group of military lawyers. I said as much 
publicly in 2013. Likewise, almost all retired 
general and flag officers I speak with today 
agree that the male-dominated chain of com-
mand has failed the victims of sexual assault 
in the military. They accept the need for 
change. 
But, in its current form, the changes con-
templated by S. 1520 are not limited to sex- 
related offenses. The bill would create an 
independent body of lawyers, outside the 
chain of command, to make charging deci-
sions for a broad range of offenses punishable 
by more than a year’s confinement. These in-
clude 
murder, 
manslaughter, 
child 
endangerment, larceny, robbery, fraudulent 
use of a credit card, kidnapping, arson, 
housebreaking, extortion, bribery, perjury, 
subornation of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. (Notably, other offenses such as re-
ceipt of stolen property, forgery and conduct 
unbecoming an officer are excluded from the 
bill’s reach, but the logic for the distinction 
is unclear.) In all, if enacted, the legislation 
would constitute the largest change to mili-
tary justice since the enactment of the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice in 1950. 
Why are offenses ranging from murder, 
arson to perjury included in the bill’s reach? 
What is the justification for so large an over-
haul? Where is the congressional finding 
that, when it comes to the broader range of 
offenses, the chain of command in the U.S. 
military has failed in its duty to carry out 
military justice? 
Supporters of the bill argue that, once 
Congress goes down the road of creating an 
independent body to make charging deci-
sions for sex crimes, it cannot stop; that to 
limit the creation of an independent body for 
sex crimes would also create the stigma of 
‘‘pink courts’’ that appear to exist for the 
benefit of women. In my view, the exception 
is warranted, perceptions can be addressed, 
and the exception should not swallow the 
rule. In both civilian and military life, the 
reality is the sex offenses are different, in 
the manner in which they are reported, in-
vestigated, and prosecuted. It should also be 
noted that victims of sexual assault are both 
men and women. 
Here are several other considerations: 
First, as written the bill appears to require 
a whole new bureaucracy to implement and 
execute the changes contemplated. No one 
should be under the illusion that the broad 
mission contemplated by the bill can be car-
ried by a small band of elite JAGs in a suite 
someplace in northern Virginia. The bill 
would require that an independent group of 
lawyers make charging decisions for a vast 
range 
Mr. REED. I think given the wise 
comments of not only Mr. JOHNSON but 
also the pending recommendations by 
the Department of Defense concerning 
this issue, again, the best place to have 
a thorough, lively debate and amend-
ments, by the way, which are precluded 
in this unanimous consent, would be in 
the Armed Services Committee in the

context of the annual defense author-
ization bill. That is where we have con-
fronted and decided these issues his-
torically. 
And with that, I would reiterate my 
objection to the Senator from New 
York’s request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
two issues: First, the op-ed by Jeh 
Johnson was not in reference to my 
legislation. In fact, he conflated my 
legislation with recommendations from 
the IRC. He mentioned lawyers in Vir-
ginia having to make the decisions. 
That is not what my bill says. It has 
never said that, and it is not how it is 
organized. In fact, my bill is organized 
by services to adjudicate these cases, 
as they are doing today. 
Right now, prosecutors prosecute 
these cases, and the decision making of 
whether to proceed to trial would be 
given to them in the first instance. If 
they decline to prosecute, it goes right 
back to the commander. So, for exam-
ple, if there wasn’t enough evidence to 
prosecute the case, it would go back to 
the commander, who could then use a 
special court-martial or he could use 
nonjudicial punishment for related or 
lesser offenses. That is typically what 
the commanders do in these cases. 
So very little changes. But what does 
change is the perception of the victim 
who is asking for unbiased review by 
someone who is highly trained to do 
that review. It also gives assurance to 
defendants’ rights that the person 
making the decision is unbiased and is 
highly and professionally trained. 
Those changes change everything. It 
changes the perception that our mili-
tary justice is blind, fair, and profes-
sional. And that is not the impression 
of servicemembers today. Both women 
and men and survivors of sexual as-
sault do not believe that justice is pos-
sible for them, and Black and Brown 
servicemembers do not believe the jus-
tice system is fair to them either. 
This solution makes sense, and I do 
not think that we should defer again 
our responsibility to one op-ed by one 
former SecDef. That is not our job, and 
that is not how we should be respond-
ing.

HELSINKI COMMISSION 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take 
this time as the Chair of the Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, better known as the Helsinki 
Commission, as we celebrate our 45th 
anniversary. 
The Helsinki Commission is the vehi-
cle for U.S. participation in the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe, representing 57 states that 
have come together under the OSCE, 
all the countries of Europe, all the 
countries of the former Soviet Union, 
including those located in Central 
Asia, the United States, and Canada. 
Mr. President, this is a unique body 
in that it represents both the executive 
and legislative branches of govern-
ment. The executive branch has rep-
resentatives on the Helsinki Commis-
sion, and both the House and Senate 
have 
Senators 
and 
Representatives 
that serve on the Helsinki Commission. 
I am very pleased to have as my co- 
leader 
Senator 
WICKER
from 
Mis-
sissippi as the Republican leader in the 
Senate on the Helsinki Commission. 
The Helsinki Commission has been 
responsible for elevating our moral di-
mension to U.S. foreign policy. Its 
principles point out very clearly that 
you cannot have security without deal-
ing with good governance and human 
rights; you cannot have economic 
progress unless you have governance 
that respects the rights of all its citi-
zens. 
That is why I was so pleased when 
President Biden announced that his 
foreign policy would be value-based, 
that as we participate in our foreign 
policy challenges, it will always be 
wrapped in our values, and his recent 
trip to Europe underscored that impor-
tant lesson. And then he issued, not 2 
weeks ago, the statement that corrup-
tion is a core national security threat 
and that we have a responsibility to 
fight corruption in order to protect our 
national security. 
I am so pleased of the accomplish-
ments of the Helsinki Commission, 
particularly from the human rights 
and human dimension. I go back to my 
early days in the House of Representa-
tives, when the Soviet Union still ex-
isted and the challenges of Soviet Jews 
trying to emigrate from the Soviet 
Union. It was the Helsinki Commission 
that was one of the leading voices to 
help deal with Soviet Jews. 
I think about trafficking in persons, 
modern-day slavery, and the efforts 
that the United States did in leading 
that effort, including passing landmark 
legislation in trafficking in persons 
and establishing a rating system where 
every country in the world is rated on 
how well they are dealing with fighting 
trafficking. Now this has become the 
model, and so many countries have 
acted. It was the U.S. Helsinki Com-
mission that led the effort for what 
Congress was able to pass and the 
international effort in order to fight 
trafficking in persons. 
I think about the perpetrators of war 
crimes and crimes against humanity 
and genocide, and recognize that it was 
the Helsinki Commission that pushed 
to hold those who were responsible for 
these atrocities accountable, particu-
larly as it related to the Balkan con-
flict. 
Then I think about the landmark leg-
islation that was passed in the Con-
gress that deals with sanctions against

human 
rights 
violators, 
first 
the 
Magnitsky sanctions and then the 
Global Magnitsky sanctions. It came 
out of hearings from the Helsinki Com-
mission and legislation that we au-
thored. It is not only the standard here 
in the United States. It has been adopt-
ed as the standard in Europe, in Can-
ada, and in other countries, to make it 
clear that human rights violators will 
not be able to hide their illicit funds in 
our banking system or visit our coun-
try. 
Perhaps our strongest contribution is 
the oversight hearings that we hold. 
We also passed the Elie Wiesel Atroc-
ities Prevention Act. But just last 
week we had a hearing in the Helsinki 
Commission on how we can prevent 
atrocities from occurring in the first 
place. So I am very proud of the accom-
plishments of the Commission. 
Part of the responsibilities of every 
member state of the OSCE is that we 
have the right to challenge any state’s 
compliance with the Helsinki Final 
Act Accords. So it is our responsibility 
to challenge when Russia violates 
those provisions or we see violations in 
Turkey—any member state you can 
challenge. 
But we also have to do our own self- 
evaluation. As chairman of the Com-
mission, I have been using that oppor-
tunity to question conduct in our own 
country when it does not match the re-
sponsibilities that we should have. We 
saw that in the past in regard to the 
torture issues in Guantanamo Bay. 
My participation in the Helsinki 
Commission goes back to my early 
days in the House of Representatives 
and some of my proudest moments of 
representing our country on the inter-
national stage. Let me just give you a 
few examples. 
In February 1991, I joined a fact-find-
ing mission to Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia. That is when the Soviet tanks 
were in Vilnius. That is when the So-
viet Union was demonstrating oppres-
sion against the people of the Baltic 
States. It was a very sad moment of op-
pression, and we went there to stand up 
for the people of the region, to let them 
know that the United States never rec-
ognized the Soviet’s occupation of the 
Baltic States, and that we stood with 
the people and their independence. 
It was very interesting. We went 
from there to Moscow, and Mikhail 
Gorbachev didn’t want to have any-
thing to do with us. He wouldn’t have 
a meeting with us, and he wouldn’t ac-
knowledge that we were there. But we 
had a meeting with Boris Yeltsin, who 
at that time was the chair of the par-
liament, and we got great visibility. 
And Yeltsin supported our efforts to 
condemn the Russian use of force. 
I have been to Germany several 
times. My first trip on behalf of the 
Helsinki Commission was when it was 
a divided country, and we went to East 
Berlin. We were the voices for those op-
pressed people whose voices could not 
otherwise be heard, and we gave them 
hope that one day they would see free-
dom. 
I then returned when we were lit-
erally taking down the Berlin Wall, 
and I joined in taking down part of the 
Berlin Wall. I have part of that as a 
prized possession in my home. 
I have returned to Germany as a 
united country and see what a demo-
cratic Germany means and the work of 
our Commission to bring down the Iron 
Curtain. Germany is now a leading 
democratic state and a great ally of 
the United States. 
I have been to Kiev, Ukraine, on sev-
eral occasions. I was there during the 
Maidan protests, where the people de-
manded democracy. And then I had a 
chance to return and monitor the elec-
tions 
in 
Ukraine 
with 
Senator 
PORTMAN—again, a country that has 
been able to rid itself of the oppression 
of the Soviet Union. 
I have been very active in the Hel-
sinki Commission in regards to the 
Parliamentary Assembly. I chaired one 
of their three standing committees. I 
had a chance to become vice president 
at the Parliamentary Assembly. 
Today, 
I 
acknowledge 
Senator 
WICKER, who is vice president. It points 
out the bipartisan nature of the Hel-
sinki Commission and our work on the 
international platform. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ERIKA SCHLAGER 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we could 
not have accomplished any of these 
achievements without an incredible 
dedicated staff to the mission of the 
Helsinki Commission, and I want to 
just acknowledge one individual who 
recently announced that she is retir-
ing, Erika Schlager, after 34 years of 
service to the Commission and to the 
global community. 
Erika received her bachelor’s degree 
from the University of North Carolina 
in Greensboro, where she graduated 
magna cum laude and was elected to 
Phi Beta Kappa. She earned her A.M. 
degree from Harvard University in So-
viet Union studies and her juris doctor 
degree with honors from the George 
Washington University Law School. 
She studied at Warsaw University as a 
Fulbright fellow and received a di-
ploma from the International Institute 
of 
Human 
Rights 
in 
Strasbourg, 
France. Quite a record. 
She used that academic preparation 
to make a difference in the world—and 
what a difference she made. Erika has 
been an unfailing professional in her 
dedication to doing whatever is nec-
essary to ensure that the Commission 
meets its mandate and defends human 
rights abroad. Her deep expertise, 
which she has honed over decades of 
work, is renowned both among policy 
professionals in the United States and 
in the countries of Central Europe that 
she followed for the Commission. 
Erika is one of our Nation’s top ex-
perts on Europe’s most vulnerable com-
munities. She is a leading voice on 
Roma rights—Europe’s largest minor-
ity, with significant populations also 
in the United States. 
I have joined Erika in the crusade to 
speak up for the Roma population, a 
group that has been denied citizenship 
in so much of Europe. What a dif-
ference she has made in their lives. 
Erika has worked with Members of 
Congress, the Department of State and 
the OSCE to address issues ranging 
from the enslavement and sterilization 
of Roma to a permanent memorial in 
Berlin dedicated to the Sinti and Roma 
victims of the Nazi regime, to annual 
recognition 
of 
International 
Roma 
Day. 
She has brought to my attention the 
candidacy of Ethel Brooks to be the 
first Roma board member of the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. I know 
that Erika will continue to bring Roma 
perspective and history on the Holo-
caust to further the tolerance, edu-
cation, and human rights work of the 
museum. 
I have the honor of representing the 
Senate on the Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum board, and I can tell you that 
Erika is so deeply respected by the pro-
fessionals at that museum for the work 
she has done in furthering the goal of 
that institution to prevent atrocities 
against any groups of people. 
Erika has long been one of my top 
advisers on the Holocaust restitution 
and Europe’s Jewish community. She 
has worked closely with me over the 
years to raise concerns about the rise 
of Holocaust revisionism in countries 
like Hungary and Poland; to foster im-
plementation of the Terezin Declara-
tion on Holocaust Era Assets measures 
to right the economic wrongs that ac-
companied the Holocaust; and to hold 
accountable a French railway that 
transported thousands of Holocaust 
victims to their deaths. She worked on 
all of these issues and made significant 
progress. 
Erika has been instrumental in en-
suring that the Helsinki Commission 
works to hold the United States ac-
countable for our own human rights 
record, examining U.S. policies and 
conduct concerning Guantanamo Bay 
detention camps and U.S. policy re-
garding torture. 
Erika’s counsel greatly assisted me 
in my role as the Parliamentary As-
sembly of the OSCE’s Special Rep-
resentative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, 
and Intolerance, where I was focused 
on human rights and justice here at 
home and across the expanse of the 57 
participating states of the OSCE. 
From the plight of African Ameri-
cans and Muslims to migrants and ref-
ugees, Erika has been integral to the 
Helsinki Commission’s mandate of up-
holding the myriad of human rights 
commitments defined in the Helsinki 
Final Act and subsequent OSCE agree-
ments. 
In addition to her many professional 
milestones and achievements, Erika re-
tires from the Commission having left 
a deeply personal mark on those she 
worked with, from diplomats and civil 
servants to the staff of the Helsinki 
Commission. She is a natural teacher

with a gift of taking a complex issue 
and distilling it in a way that makes it 
both relevant and accessible. 
Erika has taught our diplomats at 
the Foreign Service Institute and spo-
ken at international meetings and at 
universities across the Nation and 
around the world. She displayed her ex-
ceptional teaching ability at the De-
partment of State’s annual training 
program on Roma rights, and she has 
ensured that Roma civil society groups 
could also participate. 
She has actively sought out dialogue 
and collaboration with new colleagues 
to help deepen their understanding of 
the Helsinki Commission’s role, of the 
challenges the Commission could use-
fully seek to address abroad, and of the 
unique tools at its disposal to do just 
that. 
Erika is always quick to ask about a 
colleague’s well-being or inquire after 
a family member’s well-being. She has 
fostered collegiality among the Com-
mission’s staff through her unfailing 
kindness and good nature. In so doing, 
she has repeatedly demonstrated how 
deeply she cares, not just for the work 
she has dedicated her career to but also 
for the people whose great privilege it 
is to call her a colleague and a friend. 
I will say on a personal basis that I 
have benefited so much from her 
friendship, from her understanding, 
from her strategic thinking, from 
where we can make a difference. We 
know there are a lot of problems 
around the world. We know we can’t 
settle all the issues. But Erika helped 
us focus on areas where we can make a 
difference, and thanks to her input, we 
have made a difference. 
I know I speak on behalf of all Hel-
sinki Commission members and staff 
and scores of other individuals—many 
who may not know her name—and 
groups 
concerned 
about 
advancing 
human rights around the globe and 
here at home when I say how we will 
miss Erika. 
Henry David Thoreau said: ‘‘Aim 
above morality. Be not simply good; be 
good for something.’’ Erika has em-
bodied that maxim in her professional 
career and in her life. She has made an 
enormous difference, and she will con-
tinue to do so. 
I wish her all the best with respect to 
her future endeavors. I know we will 
continue to hear from her. 
Thank you, Erika, for the way you 
served the Commission, our country, 
and the global community. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
LOUISIANA 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, June 
marks the start of the Atlantic hurri-
cane season, and 2021 is on us, but my 
constituents are still suffering from 
the storms of 2020. There are a lot of 
folks in Louisiana who are still hurt-
ing. If you were to fly over Lake 
Charles, LA, you would still see blue 
tarps on roofs of homes damaged a year 
ago. 
I took to the Senate floor last month 
stressing the need for disaster supple-
mental while Lake Charles and Baton 
Rouge at that time were getting hit by 
heavy rains and severe flooding. At the 
time, Lake Charles ended up with 8 to 
15 inches of rain in less than 12 hours. 
It is heartbreaking to see them af-
fected once more by a natural disaster. 
Baton Rouge got more than 13 inches 
of rain overnight, with 15,000 homes 
and businesses without power the next 
morning. All this comes on the heels of 
Hurricanes Laura and Delta and winter 
storms which had catastrophic damage 
to livestock, crops, and structures for 
Louisiana farmers. 
For those who need a refresher, 2020 
set a record for the most named 
storms—30 in 1 season and 5 of those 
named storms hitting Louisiana, which 
is also a record. Hurricane Laura, a 
category 4 hurricane, hit Lake Charles, 
devastated it, and then almost the 
exact same place that Laura hit, Delta 
hit—category 2—6 weeks later. It is un-
precedented to have one hurricane fol-
lowed by another. 
NOAA calculates the damage from 
Hurricane Laura at about $19 billion 
and 
Delta 
at 
$2.9 
billion. 
Laura 
wreaked havoc through devastating 
winds, which reached 150 miles per 
hour at landfall—the strongest hurri-
cane to hit my State since 1856. Delta 
was just rain. In LeBleu Settlement, 
just northeast of Lake Charles, they 
received almost 18 inches. 
I may sound like a broken record, but 
I need to just play this broken record 
once more. We cannot allow the impact 
of an entire year’s worth of natural dis-
asters to go unaddressed. 
Just a few weeks ago, I was in Lake 
Charles, and I heard incredible frustra-
tion about rebuilding in the aftermath 
of these storms—a church still with its 
roof ripped off; homes, as I mentioned, 
covered with tarps—and stories from 
members of the community who are 
not back in their homes and, frankly, 
may not even be back in their city be-
cause there are no homes and there is 
no housing for them to return to. 
The people in Lake Charles have an 
incredible resilience and an incredible 
we-can-do spirit. So you go there, and 
people are laughing and they are smil-
ing, but then you see that blue tarp, 
and you know that this community 
will not recover at the way things are 
going. I would argue that the weather 
events were tragic, but the lack of ac-
tion upon recovery is making a tragedy 
worse. 
In March, my colleague from Oregon, 
Senator JEFF MERKLEY, and I urged the 
Biden administration to support a sup-
plemental disaster appropriation to ur-
gently address and direct Federal re-
sources to communities throughout 
America struggling to recover from 
hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other 
2020 natural disasters. 
President Biden came to Louisiana. 
Once more, he heard from Mayor Nic 
Hunter, Governor Edwards, and myself 
that we could hopefully have some re-
lief. We need programs like community 
development block grants, disaster re-
covery, mitigation funding, and U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineer funding for 
southwest coastal Louisiana hurricane 
and storm damage risk reduction. We 
need emergency solutions grants and 
social services block grants to provide 
assistance to the thousands of families 
who have lost their homes due to hurri-
canes like those I have been describing. 
We are past due moving quickly. If it 
happened tomorrow, it still would have 
not happened quickly, and we have 
gone into another year which could 
have similar storms. We need to help 
the people of Southwest Louisiana. The 
region has been pounded. My job is to 
do all I can to help them get back on 
their feet. 
Once more, I call on my colleagues in 
the House and the Senate with a simple 
message: Let’s get a disaster supple-
mental done. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Michigan.

EXCELLENCE IN MENTAL HEALTH 
AND 
ADDICTION 
TREATMENT 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am 
here today and soon on the floor my 
good friend Senator ROY BLUNT of Mis-
souri will be here as well to talk about 
an issue that we both care very, very 
passionately about. In fact, on October 
31, 2013, which I guess it is amazing 
how time flies, but in 2013, Senator 
BLUNT and I stood here on the Senate 
floor together to mark a very impor-
tant anniversary. It was 50 years to the 
day after President Kennedy signed 
into law the Community Mental Health 
Act—50 years to the day. And, trag-
ically, it was the last piece of legisla-
tion he ever signed, and it was one of 
the most important. 
The Community Mental Health Act 
was groundbreaking; its goal, to pro-
vide full funding for comprehensive 
mental health services in the commu-
nity. How important. Unfortunately, 
that has yet to fully happen. Instead, 
behavioral health is funded primarily 
through grants that start and then the 
grant stops. You would never say to 
someone who is having a heart attack: 
We would love to help you, but we are 
so sorry the grant ran out. Can you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4613 
June 17, 2021 
come back in 6 months? And yet that is 
what we say to people with mental ill-
ness or a substance abuse disorder. 
Every day, multiple times a day, that 
is what people hear. 
These people who need help aren’t ab-
stractions, they are our moms and dads 
and brothers and sisters and sons and 
daughters and friends and, in fact, us. I 
am so grateful to Members who have 
shared their own mental health stories; 
that includes my friend, Senator TINA 
SMITH, who bravely shared her own 
struggle with depression that so, so 
many of us have had throughout our 
lives. 
We know that with the right support, 
people who live with some kind of a 
mental health challenge can thrive. 
They do. I have often told the story of 
growing up in Clare, MI, a little rural 
town, where my dad had struggles and 
was misdiagnosed for years and finally, 
finally, finally, correctly diagnosed as 
being bipolar and getting the support 
and help with medication he needed, 
and he was able to thrive after that. 
And that is what I want to have for 
every person in Michigan, every family 
in Michigan, every family across the 
country. 
Unfortunately, far too many people 
still struggle to get the support that 
they need. We certainly have seen that 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, and it 
has gotten much, much worse, unfortu-
nately, with everything everybody has 
had to go through. 
One CDC report found that last June, 
twice as many people as usual said 
they were experiencing symptoms of 
anxiety 
and 
depression—not 
sur-
prising—and 11 percent of Americans 
have reported having serious thoughts 
of suicide in the past 30 days—in the 
past 30 days. And, tragically, 200 Amer-
icans are dying every day due to opioid 
overdoses, according to the CDC. And 
that is up 34 percent since the pan-
demic started—34 percent. Clearly, we 
need to do more to get people the men-
tal health care and the substance abuse 
treatment that they need and that 
they deserve. 
The good news is, we are well on our 
way to ensuring that healthcare above 
the 
neck 
will 
be 
treated 
like 
healthcare below the neck. This is an 
effort that Senator BLUNT and I have 
now been working on since that day we 
came to the floor in 2013. We are well 
on the way to finally seeing President 
Kennedy’s vision become a reality. 
Not long ago, Senator BLUNT and I, 
as I mentioned before, after that floor 
speech, introduced something called 
the Excellence in Mental Health Act. It 
was signed into law in 2014. It created 
certified community behavioral health 
clinics, which are funded just like fed-
erally qualified health centers. You 
have high standards, the clinic meets 
the standards, and then they get fully 
funded through the healthcare system. 
It requires these clinics to provide a 
comprehensive set of services to every-
one who walks through the door, in-
cluding 24/7, 365 days a year crisis serv-
ices, outpatient mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment, and immediate 
screenings, risk assessments, and diag-
nosis. And just as important, it re-
quires 
care 
coordination, 
including 
partnerships with emergency rooms 
and law enforcement and veterans or-
ganizations. 
Ten States, including Missouri and 
Michigan, have been selected for full 
participation in the program. And 
startup grants have been extended now 
to a number of clinics across the coun-
try—40 States, plus the District of Co-
lumbia, 300 community clinics being 
funded to get things started so far, and 
we have more coming because of the 
American Rescue Plan. These clinics 
are already making a huge difference. 
We just had a hearing in the Finance 
Committee 
this 
week 
from 
those 
speaking strongly about this model, 
this being the model for care in the 
community. Just as community health 
centers are the model of care for phys-
ical healthcare, certified community 
behavioral health clinics are now the 
model for mental health and addiction 
services. 
More than half of these clinics pro-
vide same-day services. Now, that may 
not seem like much, but the truth of 
the matter is—and this has been true 
for years in Michigan because of lack 
of funding—they only are able to help 
people with the most severe problems. 
So if you want to walk in and connect 
with somebody and express a concern, 
you are probably not going to get any 
services—certainly, 
not 
that 
day— 
under the old system. Now, more than 
half of these clinics provide same-day 
services. Nearly all of them offer treat-
ment within a week. Think about 
someone with a substance abuse issue, 
as well as a mental illness. Time is ev-
erything. And if someone is reaching 
out for help, they need to get that help 
right away. 
Ninety-five percent of these clinics 
have been engaged in one or more inno-
vative practices with law enforcement. 
It has actually been incredible to hear 
what is being done with local law en-
forcement. So when the police officers 
are called to the scene, and it is clearly 
an issue that may involve mental ill-
ness or substance abuse, they are able 
to immediately connect up with those 
who can provide those services instead 
of having to take somebody to jail 
when they shouldn’t be in jail. And we 
know that many, many people in many 
cases around the country, the majority 
of people who are in the jail are people 
who actually need mental health help 
or substance abuse help. And so there 
is wonderful collaboration now through 
these clinics going on. 
Statistics from the Department of 
Health and Human Services show that 
people who have received services at 
clinics—it is amazing numbers. I will 
just mention three: sixty-three percent 
fewer emergency rooms visits. I have 
heard from so many police officers 
talking about they are called to the 
scene, they take someone into custody 
who really just needs help, and then 
they go to the emergency rooms or 
other services, and the officer, then, 
sits there all day or longer with them 
or family members waiting, waiting, 
waiting because there are not the serv-
ices that they need. So with the cer-
tified behavioral health centers, we 
have 63 percent fewer visits to emer-
gency rooms for people who have a sub-
stance abuse problem or mental illness. 
Sixty percent less time in jail. We 
are debating a lot these days about the 
role of law enforcement and more calls, 
as we definitely need, to have support 
services in the community. Through 
the work of certified community be-
havioral health clinics in the commu-
nities where they exist, there has been 
a 60-percent reduction in folks going to 
jail. Instead, they are getting the help 
they need. 
And we have seen almost a 41-percent 
decrease 
in 
homelessness—another 
major way that people end up on the 
street or in a shelter when what they 
need is help. 
Currently, about 1.5 million people 
are accessing these services, and it is a 
start. We did it originally as a dem-
onstration to show that this could ac-
tually work and make a significant dif-
ference and actually save community 
resources, in addiction to providing 
people the help that they need and de-
serve. But we need to do more, and 
that is why we are speaking today. 
President 
Kennedy 
believed 
that 
these services should be available to 
everyone who needs them, and Senator 
BLUNT and I agree. That is why this 
week we introduced our Excellence in 
Mental Health and Addiction Treat-
ment Act of 2021. This legislation will 
expand 
these 
high-quality 
mental 
health and addiction treatment serv-
ices across the country. This is the 
next step for States and communities 
across the country to be able to have 
the healthcare funding to provide high- 
quality services that we know work. 
This is going to give every State the 
opportunity to create certified commu-
nity behavioral health clinics in their 
communities. Just imagine what that 
could mean for a veteran who is living 
with post-traumatic stress or a young 
mom who recently had a baby and is 
struggling with postpartum depression 
or a college student who is working to 
overcome his substance use disorder, 
stay in school, and earn a degree but 
just needs some help and support to be 
able to make that happen. 
Right now, only about 11 percent of 
people with substance use disorders get 
help in any given year. Think about 
that, 11 percent; about 11 percent of 
those struggling with an addiction are 
able to get help in any given year. 
Well, Senator BLUNT and I aren’t going 
to stop until 100 percent of people with 
substance abuse disorders and other 
mental illnesses are able to access the 
care that they need to thrive. 
This is really an important moment 
because we, over the last several years, 
have designed working with various ad-
ministrations now, designed quality

standards. We have demonstrated that 
providing these services makes a dif-
ference. We have strong support from 
law enforcement. We have strong sup-
port from the healthcare community, 
from the mental health and substance 
abuse community in a broad way. 
It is exciting to see this be something 
that really is bipartisan. I am so 
thrilled we have colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who are supporting 
this effort signing on. We have more 
people signing on every day. That is be-
cause we believe in these clinics. We 
believe in the services and this way of 
providing services. We have seen it for 
ourselves, how it can change people’s 
lives and give people the opportunity 
to be able to thrive. 
When we introduced our original leg-
islation, I spoke with Malkia Newman, 
whom I have known for many years. 
She lived for over 30 years with 
undiagnosed and untreated bipolar dis-
order. She finally got the treatment 
she needed through the community 
mental health system. And what she 
has done is truly amazing. We had 
Malkia come and speak as a witness for 
our healthcare subcommittee hearing 
in Finance that Senator DAINES and I 
did a few weeks ago, and she was amaz-
ing. 
Malkia is team supervisor for the 
CNS Healthcare Anti-Stigma Program 
in Waterford, MI. She is a peer educa-
tor. She is developing and leading pro-
gramming in Michigan and sharing her 
expertise all across the country. She is 
an ordained minister, and she is a 
board member of the Oakland Commu-
nity Health Network, where she has 
served several terms as board chair and 
vice chair. 
Last month, when she testified at our 
Senate Finance Health Subcommittee 
hearing, she said: I am living proof. I 
am living proof. I am an advocate, and 
I am proud to speak on behalf of those 
who have not yet found their voice. 
Malkia found her voice. It is time to 
make sure that everyone in our com-
munities has the support they need to 
do the same. 
I am looking forward to working 
with my friend Senator BLUNT and all 
of our colleagues who have already 
signed on as original cosponsors, and 
we welcome everyone in this body to 
join us in moving forward legislation 
that we have demonstrated makes a 
difference—saving money, saving lives. 
It is now time to make these services 
available across the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Michi-
gan. 
Ms. STABENOW. I just wanted to let 
my friend Senator BLUNT, whom I have 
been talking about now on the floor—I 
just wanted to say, with him here—and 
I knew he was going to be here shortly, 
but I just want to say again what a real 
pleasure and honor it has been to part-
ner with my friend Senator BLUNT in 
this really major movement to trans-
form the way we fund community men-
tal health and addiction services. 
And our Presiding Officer has also 
been a leader in this. I want to thank 
her for that as well. But I just want to 
thank my partner, as I was indicating 
before we came down, on the 50th anni-
versary of President Kennedy’s signing 
his last bill. 
And I am pleased we have been able 
to pick up the torch, and we are going 
to get it over the finish line and make 
sure these wonderful services are avail-
able across the country. 
Mr. BLUNT. Thank you. Madam 
President.

ator from Missouri. 
f 
EXCELLENCE IN MENTAL HEALTH 
AND ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, let 
me say, our times got changed today a 
little bit, and I was trying to finish an-
other thing to get over here and hear 
in person what Senator STABENOW had 
to say. She has been an incredible lead-
er in this effort, a great partner. 
As she mentioned, we came to the 
floor the last day of October 2013, 
which was the 50th anniversary of 
President Kennedy’s signing the Com-
munity Mental Health Act. Well-in-
tended, but an awful lot of it just 
didn’t get done. Facilities were closed 
that maybe were well overdue to be 
closed, but the opportunities weren’t 
put in place to replace them as that act 
had hoped they would be. 
I think we have been in the process of 
making big strides toward doing that. 
That was 2013. In 2014, we were able to 
get the first pilot project for Excel-
lence in Mental Health put into place, 
an eight-State pilot project, where we 
were looking not only at the impact on 
those individuals and families who 
needed to have their behavioral health 
issue treated like all other health 
issues but also, frankly, looking to see 
what impact it had on all their other 
health issues when your behavioral 
health issue is being treated as it 
should be. 
One of the great costs in healthcare 
is missed appointments. You have got 
to believe that almost 20 percent of the 
population 
that 
has 
a 
behavioral 
health issue is more likely to miss an 
appointment than everybody else, and, 
of course, that costs the whole system, 
but it particularly costs them. 
If you are going to the doctor when 
you need to, taking the medicine you 
are supposed to take for any kind of 
health issue, eating better, sleeping 
better, feeling better about yourself, 
your health issues are dealt with in a 
different way. 
Nearly one in five Americans, accord-
ing to the NIH, has a behavioral health 
problem, but only a fraction of those 
Americans get the care they need. The 
NIH says they have a diagnosable—al-
most one out of five Americans has a 
diagnosable and almost always treat-
able behavioral health problem. But, 
certainly, one out of five Americans 
who have that problem don’t get the 
care they need to deal with that prob-
lem. 
The COVID pandemic added to many 
of those challenges, and, realistically, 
it would, if you think about it. If you 
have got a behavioral health issue, 
that is not normally going to be helped 
by 
isolation, 
by 
worrying 
about 
healthcare for yourself or somebody 
you care about, wondering whether you 
are going to lose your job or someone 
in your family is going to lose their 
job. None of those things are going to 
be helpful. 
The other area that comes into play 
there is an addiction issue of any kind. 
If you don’t have a behavioral health 
issue before you have an opioid depend-
ency or some other addiction issue, you 
certainly have one after that addiction 
takes over. 
So all of those things were exacer-
bated by the pandemic. The percentage 
of Americans with symptoms of anx-
iety or depression grew by more than 
40 percent. Drug overdose deaths in-
creased by 20 percent between October 
of 2019 and 2020. It was 30 percent. I 
think I may have said 20—30 percent. 
That was after 3 years of having drug 
overdose deaths headed in a dramati-
cally different direction, but suddenly 
2020 was the highest year ever for drug 
overdose deaths. 
So the challenges of that are great. 
We now have 10 States, including both 
Missouri and Michigan, that went 
through a competitive process and be-
came part of the original Excellence in 
Mental Health States. 
In all of those States, we have cer-
tified community behavioral health 
clinics that have to meet standards. 
They have to meet standards of who 
staffs that clinic; they have to be avail-
able 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with 
crisis management as a possibility. 
They can do preventive screenings. 
They can determine appropriate care 
coordination with other providers, like 
emergency room departments or vet-
erans services. 
All of those things make a dramatic 
difference in people’s lives. People get-
ting help through the clinics often 
have access to primary care treatment 
as well. I have visited a lot of those 
clinics in our State. I have seen what 
happens 
with 
these 
demonstration 
projects. They are enabling more peo-
ple to get the complete healthcare they 
need—and, again, including mental 
healthcare and addictive treatment— 
quicker, closer to home. 
In new data from the National Coun-
cil for Mental Wellbeing, 84 percent of 
those clinics, the CCBHCs they are 
calling them—84 percent of them were 
able to see clients within the first 
week. I think 100 percent of them were 
able to see a client who needed to be 
seen that day, that day. I certainly 
hope that is the goal. I hope nobody 
goes to a clinic, if professionals believe 
you need help right now, who doesn’t 
get help right now. 
But 84 percent of the people who 
show up get an appointment within the

first week. That definitely was not the 
case 10 years ago, and it is not the case 
now in States that haven’t become part 
of this program. 
Ninety-five percent of those clinics 
are involved with law enforcement ac-
tivities and nursing and criminal jus-
tice centers. In my hometown of 
Springfield, MO, every patrol officer 
who has been trained in crisis interven-
tion has an iPad with them that they 
can connect anybody they are talking 
to with a 24/7 Burrell community 
health center. 
And they do. I have seen that happen. 
I have traveled with officers who have 
done that. And, by the way, I am sure 
they didn’t have me with an officer 
who wasn’t really good, but you could 
see, no matter how good that officer 
was, the individual, when they were 
talking to somebody at the clinic who 
was a professional dealing with this all 
the time, you could see that conversa-
tion took on a totally different tone. 
We have seen more and more efforts 
to try to help with substance abuse. We 
have been able to fund the federally 
qualifying clinics in new ways because 
of that. 
So 10 States are totally in this pro-
gram. Forty States, under an amend-
ment we made a couple of years after 
we got started, have been able to take 
county units or other units that they 
can qualify into the Excellence in Men-
tal Health Program. 
So what we are working on now with 
our colleagues is an effort to, once 
again, make this available to the en-
tire country. I think we have had 
enough proof in the last 7 years or so to 
show it makes a big difference. 
Again, let me say, everybody has al-
ways known that this is the right thing 
to do, and they have always known it is 
the thing that even was financially 
smart in the long run. I think we are 
also showing here how, in the imme-
diate healthcare context, it makes a fi-
nancially smart investment to help 
somebody with their behavioral health 
challenges as you are working with all 
of their other health challenges. 
Behavioral health, mental health 
needs to be treated like all other 
health. This Congress, this year, hope-
fully starting in this Senate, has the 
ability to say: OK. We are ready to 
open the door now to every State that 
wants to participate in a program that 
would treat mental health like all 
other health. 
I know Senator STABENOW and I are 
going to be working hard together, and 
you are going to be helping us as we 
work to get this done. 
Thank you for the time today. I look 
forward to the further debate of these 
issues. I think we have come a long 
way within the last 8 years. We can see 
the full opportunity here right on the 
horizon. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office, 
every time they look at this, thinks it 
costs less than they thought the time 
before because they are seeing the 
overall impact in ways that we thought 
these pilots would prove. 
So let’s get this done this year. I 
look forward to working hard to do it 
and look forward to a full debate and 
vote on this issue on the Senate floor. 
I would yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
next week looks like a busy week. That 
is fine. We have a lot of things we need 
to be able to cover and to be able to 
walk through as the Senate. 
Next week will be particularly divi-
sive, though, in some of the issues that 
are coming up. Let me give you two ex-
amples that I hear are on the docket 
for next week. One of them deals with 
how we vote in America. 
In Oklahoma, we know how we vote. 
Each State determines its own struc-
ture of how they vote. In Oklahoma, 
you can do absentee mail-in voting, 
with no excuses. If for any reason you 
want to be able to mail in a ballot, you 
can do that. You can do in-person vot-
ing early. In fact, this year, our State 
legislature met, and they added an-
other day of in-person voting. So there 
are lots of days of in-person voting in 
Oklahoma. You could actually go to 
the poll the day of the election and be 
able to vote then. It is up to you. 
We have very straightforward voter 
ID laws. We have a system set up that 
if you do early voting or absentee vot-
ing, all the disputes on those are han-
dled before election day itself, so that 
on election day, when the polls close at 
7 p.m., we then finish all the voting—or 
the counting, I should say, on early ab-
sentee, on early in-person, and then we 
are counting the day of. Usually by 
about 10:30 at night on election day, we 
are done voting and everyone is watch-
ing all the final results in from the en-
tire State. 
It is a pretty straightforward, clean 
process that we have seen that is ex-
ceptionally reliable. In fact, it is so 
tough, in 2016, when the Russians were 
probing different systems to try to get 
into it, our State was one of the States 
the Russians tried to get into, couldn’t 
get into our system, and they moved 
on to other States to try to get into 
those. 
We have a secure system. We have a 
reliable system. But that is apparently 
not enough because S. 1 that is coming 
to the floor next week would say: Okla-
homa, we are going to completely 
change your system. People in Wash-
ington, DC, don’t like how you vote, 
don’t like your clean, reliable effi-
ciency. Regardless of complaints, we 
think we want to change it here in 
Washington, DC. 
Interestingly enough, we have a sys-
tem that can also verify if someone 
voted twice. In fact, in this past elec-
tion, 57 people in Oklahoma voted 
twice. We could verify that after the 
fact based on all the records, and we 
can go back and be able to actually 
prosecute those individuals who chose 
to vote twice because that is not legal. 
Here is what happens when S. 1 
comes to the floor. The debate here on 
S. 1 will begin with no voter ID. Take 
away your voter ID in Oklahoma. 
Change the way you do early voting. In 
fact, change the way the ballots are ac-
tually collected entirely. No longer in 
Oklahoma will we know the winner of 
our election at 10:30 on election night. 
S. 1 changes that and said that ballots 
have to be able to be allowed to trickle 
in for 10 more days after the election is 
over. So we won’t know at 10:30 at 
night on election night; we will know 2 
weeks later who actually won the elec-
tions. 
As far as a reliable system that we 
can all verify and check—oh, no, it 
changes that dramatically. It now 
opens up what is called ballot har-
vesting. Ballot harvesting would allow 
political operatives to go door-to-door 
to be able to engage with people who 
had mail-in ballots and to say to them 
‘‘Have you mailed your ballot in?’’ If 
they say ‘‘No,’’ they can say ‘‘Well, 
let’s just fill it out right here on the 
porch, and then you can hand it to me, 
and I will take it in.’’ 
So on election day, what happens is, 
political operatives show up with boxes 
full of ballots and turn in boxes full of 
ballots with the words ‘‘Trust me; 
these are all good.’’ 
I would tell you, in Oklahoma, we 
like it better when the postman carries 
that ballot or when you actually turn 
it in to that county or precinct official 
so we know where it has been, that 
there has been an accurate chain of 
custody, not someone showing up with 
a box full of ballots saying ‘‘Trust me; 
I collected all of these’’ because when 
that happens and someone is just col-
lecting ballots, you have no idea if the 
person voting voted for one person and 
left the rest of them blank and the per-
son carrying them just filled out the 
rest of the ballot for them. You have 
no chain of custody at all on it. That is 
why I say S. 1 makes voting easy, 
cheating easy, and verifying elections 
impossible. 
This is not the direction we should 
go. If we want to build trust in our 
election system in America, let’s let 
each State build trust in their election 
system for each State, like we do in 
Oklahoma, where we work together to 
make sure we can make it as easy as 
possible for every person to be able to 
vote and to encourage every person to 
vote, but when it is over, to verify that 
election and to be able to know that we 
can check it all off and to go, regard-
less of the outcome, we can trust the 
outcome because we know we can 
verify it. 
Let’s make it easy to vote, hard to 
cheat, and easy to verify—not having 
Washington, DC, folks here say DC is 
righteous and States are wrong. I think 
there are lots of great people all over 
the country who want to do their elec-
tions right and who aren’t Republicans 
or Democrats; they are just people pro-
tecting democracies in the States. 
Let’s keep that system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4616 
June 17, 2021 
That is the first of two divisive bills 
that are coming up next week, which 
will absolutely fail in this body and 
should fail in this body. There is a sec-
ond bill that I understand is coming up 
next week, as well, and it is called the 
Equality Act. 
Now, I will tell you that it is a great 
name, and I don’t know of anyone on 
my side of the aisle or on the other side 
of the aisle who opposes equality. I will 
state frankly that no person should be 
discriminated against in America—no 
person. It is a basic constitutional 
principle: We are all equal under the 
law—all of us. We have different ideas 
about music and food. We have dif-
ferent ideas about sexuality. We have 
different ideas about occupations. We 
have different skin colors. We have dif-
ferent faiths. We are a tapestry, and 
that is one of the things that makes us 
strong in such a perfect way as to build 
a more perfect Union. I believe that 
every person should be protected from 
discrimination in America, but that 
does mean every person. 
Today, the Supreme Court ruled 9 to 
0—9 to 0 in the Supreme Court—that 
Catholic Social Services in Philadel-
phia was being discriminated against 
by the city of Philadelphia because the 
city of Philadelphia said to Catholic 
Social Services: You cannot practice 
your Catholic faith in foster services. 
Now, what is the story? 
There have been Catholic services in 
Philadelphia since the 1700s. For the 
last 50 years, Catholic Social Services 
in Philadelphia, this particular organi-
zation, has served the neediest children 
in that area by providing foster serv-
ices and placement for them. They are 
a religious organization, a faith-based 
organization—a 
Catholic 
organiza-
tion—and they believe that God cre-
ated man and woman and that this is 
God’s design for marriage. So, in their 
placement of foster children, they 
place children in homes where there is 
a man and a woman who are present in 
marriage because of their profound be-
lief. 
There are 20 other foster services in 
Philadelphia that place foster children 
in any family situation: husband and 
wife or two men or two women. There 
are 20 of those services in Philadelphia, 
but the city of Philadelphia went to 
Catholic Social Services and said: You 
have to be like the other 20. You can-
not practice your faith. 
Even though, literally, Catholic So-
cial Services had never had a gay fam-
ily reach out to them for an adoption 
placement—they had gone to other 
places—the city of Philadelphia said: 
No, you have to change your practice. 
Unfortunately, Catholic Social Serv-
ices had to argue for their religious 
freedom all the way to the Supreme 
Court, and, today, they ruled 9 to 0 
that a faith-based institution cannot 
be discriminated against because of 
their faith. They should be able to live 
out the tenets of their faith and be able 
to practice them. To me, that is a 
great decision to make—to say: Why 
can’t we coexist? Why can’t we honor 
everyone in their differences of opin-
ion? 
Even 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
stated 
today, in its opinion, that there was no 
work from Catholic Social Services to 
stop gay marriages in Philadelphia or 
to stop couples from fostering children 
who are gay couples there. They just 
chose not to do it based on their faith. 
So they were not working against indi-
viduals. They were practicing their 
faith. 
Now comes the Equality Act vote 
next week. The Equality Act would, for 
the first time ever in this Congress, 
take away the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act in statute—it would re-
move it—and say there could be no pro-
tection for religious institutions. This 
is a direct shot against the Supreme 
Court, in its 9 to 0 decision today, 
which said: No, religious institutions 
have to be protected in their decisions. 
Why can’t both exist? Why do we 
have to get into a situation, as the 
Equality Act does, that says, if you 
don’t agree with one particular expres-
sion, then you have to be canceled? 
that you have to be silenced? Why has 
it come to this in America? 
The way the Equality Act is written 
is, with regard to any faith-based insti-
tution, if they did any public, outward- 
facing work at all—if they fed the 
homeless, which many do; if they pro-
vided clothing; if they took care of in-
dividuals with food who needed it—that 
was considered to be of public accom-
modation, their labor laws, even if they 
were religious institutions, had to be 
exactly like large corporate labor rules 
as well. It literally imposes on reli-
gious institutions that you can be a 
private entity and be inward facing, 
but if you are going to do your mission 
to actually serve the needy, then you 
have to actually shift to be like cor-
porate America. That is not providing 
opportunities for people of faith to live 
their faiths. 
I have to tell you that I honor people 
of faith—people of different faiths, peo-
ple of faiths that I disagree with. The 
nature of religious liberty in our coun-
try is to be able to honor people of dif-
ferent faiths. That is also what the Su-
preme Court reaffirmed today directly 
in contradiction to the Equality Act. 
Clearly, if this were to pass—and I do 
not believe it will—the Supreme Court 
would hear it immediately, would align 
with this case from today, and would 
say: We have already ruled on these 
issues 9 to 0—that is, against not allow-
ing people to be able to live their 
faiths. 
Unfortunately, there are some in this 
body who not only vehemently disagree 
with the Supreme Court and with the 
opportunity for people to be able to 
live their faiths, but they are willing to 
do it in the most pejorative of terms. 
When I spoke against the Equality 
Act in the Judiciary Committee, just 
weeks ago, and shared the issues that I 
had that were pragmatic labor issues 
and set those in front of it and also did 
a challenge on a religious liberty issue 
and said, ‘‘Here are the obvious issues 
of religious liberty where I think it is 
unconstitutional,’’ the response I got 
from a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee was, This reminds me of the Ku 
Klux Klan, who burned crosses and 
used religious symbols to hide behind 
their bigotry. 
The Supreme Court disagreed with 
that today and said: We are the United 
States of America. We honor people of 
faith to be able to live their faiths. We 
honor people who don’t have faith or 
have differences in their faiths and 
choose to be able to live that out. This 
body should not try to cancel out every 
group of faith in the country that dis-
agrees with people in this body who 
say: You cannot practice your faith if 
we tell you no. That is not who we are. 
The Equality Act is not about equal-
ity. It is about imposing and prohib-
iting disagreements. We are Ameri-
cans. We can respect each other and 
disagree. We can live next-door to each 
other and disagree. Let’s prove it in 
this body by not passing the poorly 
named Equality Act but by actually 
demonstrating what this act says it 
wants to demonstrate. Let’s treat each 
other with respect in our differences 
and honor us in that. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4619 
June 17, 2021 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President. I 
rise today to recognize the annual com-
memoration of Juneteenth, the date on 
which the news of the end of slavery 
reached the enslaved peoples in the 
Southwestern States. On June 19, 1865, 
MG Gordon Granger and Union soldiers 
communicated the news of liberation 
to one of the last remaining confed-
erate outposts in Galveston, TX. Over 2 
years after President Abraham Lincoln 
issued the Emancipation Proclama-
tion, the enslaved individuals there had 
yet to hear the good news. 
Over the years, African-American 
communities nationwide and in Mary-
land have developed rich traditions 
around this historically significant 
date. For all Americans, Juneteenth of-
fers an opportunity to reflect upon and 
to educate ourselves further about the 
terrible history of slavery and its en-
during legacy. The story of Juneteenth 
also reminds me of the gap between the 
values and principles that we espouse 
and the realities of life for everyday 
Americans, in particular the most vul-
nerable. 
I have long supported legislation to 
add Juneteenth National Independence 
Day to the list of legal Federal public 
holidays. After many years, I am 
pleased that the Senate has finally 
passed it and hope that the House will 
act swiftly to send this bill to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk. 
In commemoration of this year’s hol-
iday, I want to take the opportunity to 
reflect in more depth on a couple of 
ways that we continue to see the clear 
impact of slavery today. One of the 
most apparent legacies is access—or 
should I say lack of access—to the bal-
lot box. Study after study and the lived 
experiences of so many individuals tell 
us that Black Americans still experi-
ence greater barriers to voting than 
White Americans. One of the most im-
portant tenets of our comprehensive 
legislation to protect democracy, the 
For the People Act, S. 1, is enacting a 
Federal floor when it comes to voting 
rights standards. 
Spreading false or misleading infor-
mation intended to suppress voting and 
intimidate the electorate remains one 
of the most effective methods used to 
keep individuals, particularly Black 
Americans and other racial minorities, 
from voting. Advancements in our 
means of communication, including 
the rise of social media platforms, have 
made it easier for bad actors to use 
these strategies. During the 2020 elec-
tion cycle, robocalls targeting commu-
nities of color in Michigan, Pennsyl-
vania, Ohio, Illinois, and New York 
contained false information about how 
the recipients’ data would be shared if 
they voted by mail. I have introduced 
legislation, along with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, to address these problems by 
prohibiting individuals from knowingly 
deceiving others about the time, place, 
eligibility, or procedures of partici-
pating in a Federal election. Our bill to 
ban deceptive practices, S. 1840, would 
also prohibit individuals from inten-
tionally hindering, interfering with, or 
preventing another person from voting, 
registering to vote, or aiding another 
person to vote or register to vote in a 
Federal election. 
In 2020, more than 5 million individ-
uals and as many as one in five African 
Americans in some States were disen-
franchised because of voter suppression 
laws. 
Many voter disenfranchisement laws 
today come from post-Civil War efforts 
to stifle the 14th and 15th Amend-
ments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 
13 States enacted or expanded their fel-
ony disenfranchisement laws. One of 
the primary goals of these laws was to 
prevent Black Americans from voting. 
At least 11 of those States still bar in-
dividuals on felony probation or parole 
from voting. Under our Constitution, 
there is no legitimate justification for 
denying people from having a voice in 
our democracy. Disenfranchising citi-
zens who are living and working in the 
community serves no compelling State 
interest and hinders their rehabilita-
tion and reintegration into society. My 
Democracy Restoration Act, S. 481, 
would restore Federal voting rights for 
all individuals immediately upon re-
lease from incarceration. 
I am proud that both my Deceptive 
Practices and Voter Intimidation Act 
and my Democracy Restoration Act 
are included within the For the People 
Act. 
Finally, I want to end by com-
mending my home State of Maryland 
for bipartisan restorative justice work 
over the past several years. The Mary-
land General Assembly voted nearly 
unanimously in 2019 to investigate the 
more than 40 documented racial terror 
lynchings that took place in Maryland 
between 1854 and 1933, to hold public 
hearings in communities where racial 
terror lynchings occurred, and to de-
velop recommendations that are rooted 
in restorative justice for addressing, 
engaging, and reconciling those com-
munities. The commission the State 
established has received supplemental 
funding from the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s Emmett Till Cold Case Inves-
tigations Program for its efforts. Be-
cause of this work, Governor Hogan 
issued posthumous pardons last month 
for 34 victims of racial lynchings in 
Maryland. 
This Juneteenth, I encourage all 
Americans to recognize Juneteenth as 
an opportunity to reflect upon our Na-
tion’s shared history, to recognize the 
enduring effects of slavery on our soci-
ety, and to commit to being involved in 
the redemptive work toward a more 
just and perfect Union. 
f 
NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY 
Mr. 
CASSIDY. 
Madam 
President, 
today I rise in recognition of seer-
sucker manufacturers and enthusiasts 
across the United States. I wish every-
one a happy National Seersucker Day. 
This uniquely American fashion has a 
storied history dating back to 1909. The 
first seersucker suit was designed by 
Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street fa-
cility in New Orleans, LA. Louisiana is 
proud to have played an important part 
in introducing the country to seer-
sucker apparel. 
This 
lightweight 
cotton 
fabric, 
known for its signature pucker, has 
been worn and enjoyed by Americans 
across the country during the hot sum-
mer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: 
‘‘Hot is hot, no matter what you do for 
a living.’’ 
In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was es-
tablished by Members of this Chamber 
to honor this unique American fashion. 
I proudly resumed this tradition in 2014 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
and continued this tradition in the 
U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to des-
ignate Thursday, June 17, as the eighth 
annual National Seersucker Day. I en-
courage everyone to wear seersucker 
on this day to commemorate this tradi-
tionally American clothing. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MAX ENGLISH 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
SGM Max English served the Nation 
honorably for over 28 years in the U.S. 
Army. He fought in combat operations 
throughout World War II and bravely 
led 36 men as a platoon sergeant in the 
Battle of the Bulge. His extraordinary 
service continued to the Pacific the-
ater in the waning months of the war. 
Only a few years later, he returned to 
the Pacific to fight in the Korean war. 
During his service in the Second 
World War, Sergeant Major English 
was injured in Germany and was 
awarded the Purple Heart. During the 
Battle 
of 
Bulge, 
Sergeant 
Major 
English fought and repelled repeated 
Nazi attacks and ultimately helped 
break the back of Hitler’s forces. After 
sustained combat operations in Europe, 
Sergeant Major English served in the 
Southern Pacific theater and pursued 
the treacherous mission of rooting out 
irreconciled Japanese Imperial Army 
forces after their country’s uncondi-
tional surrender. 
A member of ‘‘the greatest genera-
tion’’, Sergeant Major English again 
answered the call of duty when he was 
deployed to the Korean war. There, his 
unit was tasked with repatriating 
Americans formerly held as prisoners 
of war during the conflict. The heroic 
actions of Sergeant Major English’s 
unit directly contributed to the imple-
mentation of an armistice to stop the 
fighting on the Korean Peninsula. 
Sergeant Major English is a man of 
exceptional character and commitment 
to the United States who embodies the 
American spirit and serves as an inspi-
ration for today’s fighting men and 
women. I join all grateful Americans in 
congratulating him for his outstanding 
service and patriotism and thank him 
for a job well done.

TRIBUTE TO JANET PIRAINO 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the service of Janet 
Piraino, my State director, who will 
retire from my office and the U.S. Sen-
ate on July 19, 2021. 
Janet has spent her professional ca-
reer dedicated to serving Wisconsin-
ites. A graduate of the University of 
Wisconsin—Madison, Janet forged a 
path in public service early in her ca-
reer. Her first job was as a field orga-
nizer for a race for Wisconsin Gov-
ernor, followed by nearly 10 years as a 
legislative policy advisor to Wisconsin 
legislators in the State capitol. 
Janet quickly earned recognition as 
a valued staff member and committed 
leader. Her experiences working with 
both legislators and constituents led to 
her assuming positions in a variety of 
roles, both at the local and Federal 
government level. 
Over the past 30-plus years, Janet has 
served in a variety of capacities with 
many Wisconsin elected officials, in-
cluding 7 years as State director for 
U.S. Senator Russ Feingold; 2 years as 
chief of staff for Congressman Tom 
Barrett; 8 years as chief of staff for 
Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz; and 2 
years as district director for U.S. Con-
gressman MARK POCAN. Outside of her 
roles in government, Janet has also 
worked as a special assistant for State 
relations at the University of Wis-
consin System and as vice president for 
advancement at the Overture Center 
Foundation in Madison, where she led 
the charge to help transition this leg-
acy performing arts venue from a city- 
run venue to a privately owned facil-
ity. 
Janet is also an active member of 
many community organizations, in-
cluding Madison’s Downtown Rotary. 
She spends considerable time engaged 
in meeting with others interested in 
pursuing a career in public service and 
has mentored countless Wisconsinites 
over these many years. 
Outside of the office, Janet enjoys 
spending time with her partner of 20 
years, J.R. Sims, their grandbaby, 
Titan Cairo Sims, and their enthusi-
astic pandemic puppy, Sadie. Janet 
also enjoys traveling and participating 
in organized bike rides, including the 
Door County Century and the Best 
Dam Bike Tour on her Wisconsin made 
Trek Madone. She is a devoted fan of 
the 
Milwaukee 
Bucks, 
especially 
Giannis Antetokounmpo, and is always 
eager to host friends and colleagues on 
her roof deck overlooking the Madison 
skyline. 
I knew of Janet’s can-do reputation 
and energetic commitment to public 
service long before she joined my Sen-
ate office in 2015, and I am delighted 
that she has become a valued member 
of our team. Along with my entire U.S. 
Senate staff, I wish her all the best as 
she begins a new chapter with her well- 
deserved retirement. 
TRIBUTE TO COLONEL DAVID W. 
TROTTER 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, as a 
member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, I rise to pay tribute to 
COL David W. Trotter, who has self-
lessly served our great country as a 
U.S. Army intelligence officer. He is a 
fellow alumnus of the Iowa State Uni-
versity Cyclone Battalion and a dear 
friend of mine. 
Colonel Trotter will retire on Novem-
ber 30, 2021, after a successful 30-year 
military career as an accomplished 
leader, infantry, and intelligence offi-
cer. Dave’s leadership abilities were 
evident early on. I met Dave early in 
my days at Iowa State, where he served 
as a personal mentor and driving factor 
to my own service to this great Nation. 
From those early days, he grew even 
more as a leader and soldier, ulti-
mately completing a storied career at 
home and abroad, in peace and in war. 
It is fitting that we recognize his serv-
ice to this great Nation. 
Colonel Trotter was commissioned in 
1992 upon graduating from Iowa State 
University as a distinguished military 
graduate with a bachelor in business. 
Dave served as an infantry platoon 
leader in Korea and a company execu-
tive officer at Fort Carson, CO. He then 
was selected as a company commander 
for 18 months with Headquarters and 
Headquarters Company, 5th Battalion, 
20th Infantry Regiment in Fort Lewis, 
WA. After command, he served as an 
operations officer for the Des Moines, 
IA, Recruiting Battalion before being 
selected for the prestigious 75th Ranger 
Regiment. 
Upon arrival at the 75th Ranger Regi-
ment in Fort Benning, GA, Dave served 
as an assistant intelligence officer. He 
then was selected again for command, 
where he served as the military intel-
ligence 
detachment 
commander. 
Throughout his time in the 75th Rang-
er Regiment, Dave deployed in support 
of Operations Enduring Freedom and 
Iraqi Freedom. 
As a field-grade officer, Dave served 
as an operations officer in the XVIII 
Airborne Corps, G2 section at Fort 
Bragg, NC. He then served as an oper-
ations officer and executive officer 
within the 525th Battlefield Surveil-
lance Brigade, where he also deployed 
in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
He then served again as an operations 
officer for the Intelligence and Secu-
rity Command at Fort Belvoir, VA, be-
fore being selected for command of the 
Army 
Geospatial 
Intelligence 
Bat-
talion at Springfield, VA. 
After various staff positions, Dave 
served as the chief of staff, Afghanistan 
Ministry of Interior Advisory Group, 
where he deployed again to Afghani-
stan in support of Operations Enduring 
Freedom and Freedom Sentinel. After 
a brief year on staff at Fort Huachuca, 
AZ, Dave deployed again in support of 
Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq, 
where he served as the III Corps G2. 
After redeployment, he was chosen to 
serve as the Army North senior intel-
ligence officer. He then would transfer 
once more to Joint Base San Antonio, 
Fort Sam Houston, TX, where he 
served as the executive officer to the 
commanding general of Army North, 
Fifth Army. 
As his final assignment in uniform, 
COL David W. Trotter was selected to 
serve as the deputy commander for 
Joint Base San Antonio and the vice 
commander of the 502d Air Base Wing. 
A highly decorated officer, Dave 
earned several service awards, includ-
ing the Legion of Merit with oak leaf 
cluster and the Bronze Star with oak 
leaf cluster, for his service. He also 
earned the Ranger Tab, the Master 
Parachutist 
Badge, 
the 
Pathfinder 
Badge, and the Air Assault Badge. 
Dave has deployed in support of com-
bat operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, 
and Syria. He has served at every level 
and commanded with distinction at the 
company through brigade levels within 
the conventional force and within the 
Army’s premier Special Operations 
Command. He and his family have sac-
rificed so much to ensure America can 
be what it is today. 
David, congratulations on your suc-
cessful career and well-deserved retire-
ment. I want to thank you and your 
family for the sacrifices you have made 
over the past 30 years. I join my col-
leagues in Congress and all Americans 
as we express our deepest appreciation 
for your service, acknowledge you and 
your family’s many accomplishments 
and sacrifices, and wish the very best 
for you, your wife Tami, and your son 
Ty in the future.

including leading efforts to secure and build 
the United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs’ Lafayette Community Based Out-
patient Clinic, which opened in 2016; and 
Whereas, due to Rodney’s dedication in re-
alizing the veterans clinic in Lafayette, the

bears signs saying, ‘‘Veterans Way, Honorary 
Rodney Hamilton’’; and 
Whereas, Rodney Carroll Hamilton Sr. 
passed away at the age of eighty-eight on 
November 30, 2020. Therefore, be it 
Resolved that the Legislature of Louisiana 
hereby memorializes the Louisiana congres-
sional delegation and the United States Con-
gress to take such actions as are necessary 
to rename the United States Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs’ 
Lafayette 
Community 
Based Outpatient Clinic in honor of Rodney 
C. Hamilton Sr., and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution 
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the 
United States Senate, the clerk of the

POM–21. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia urging the United States Congress to 
extend federal tax incentives to participants 
in Jumpstart Savings programs that are 
similar to those that are currently provided 
to participants in College Savings plans; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 24 
Whereas, The economy of the United 
States is experiencing increased demands for 
highly trained, skilled tradespeople to fill 
jobs in the construction, welding, and other 
vocational sectors; and 
Whereas, In the United States, there are 
nearly half a million more jobs available in 
the skilled trades than workers with the 
skills to fill them; and 
Whereas, The number of available jobs in 
the skilled trades is anticipated to rise to 
two million over the next decade; and 
Whereas, A traditional college education is 
one path to success, but not the only path, 
especially in light of the increasing costs of 
a traditional four-year college degree and 
the growing demand for skilled labor; and 
Whereas, Encouraging students and their 
families to invest in alternative forms of 
postsecondary skills could help reshape our 
nation’s future workforce; and 
Whereas, Providing the next generation 
the ability to save money for the future 
costs of tools, equipment, and business ex-
penses will make it easier to enter a voca-
tion, trade, or start a small business in the 
skilled trades industry; and 
Whereas, The West Virginia Legislature 
has adopted legislation authorizing the West 
Virginia Jumpstart Savings Program, which 
creates several tax incentives to help pro-
gram participants save money, by allowing 
an income tax deduction for contributions to 
a Jumpstart Savings account, by providing 
businesses with a non-refundable state tax 
credit for matching an employee’s own con-
tribution to his or her account each year; 
and 
Whereas, The Jumpstart Savings Program 
will allow individuals to roll 529 College Sav-
ings plan funds over to a Jumpstart Savings 
account without facing state income tax 
penalties; and 
Whereas, West Virginia’s Jumpstart Sav-
ings Program could be a model for other 
states to invest in the future entrepreneur-
ship and small business trade industries in 
our nation, and Congress should extend fed-
eral tax benefits to such programs; therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia: 
That Congress is urged to provide tax bene-
fits to participants in Jumpstart Savings 
programs that are similar to those currently 
provided to participants in College Savings 
plans pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 529; and, be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Delegates is hereby directed to forward a 
copy of this resolution, along with a copy of 
the Jumpstart Savings Act, to the President 
and Secretary of the United States Senate, 
to the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, and to 
members of West Virginia’s congressional 
delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 2100. A bill to amend the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to en-
sure the safety of cosmetics; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce bipartisan leg-
islation with Senator COLLINS today to 
improve safety standards on products 
that affect every single American 
household. Most people assume that 
the personal care products they use 
every day are safe, whether it is sham-
poo or shaving cream, lotion or make- 
up, hair dye or deodorant. 
In reality, however, these products 
are not approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for safety before being 
sold, and the FDA’s authority to regu-
late these products are sorely out-
dated. In fact, it’s been more than 
eighty years since the law has changed 
on how oversight is conducted for these 
products. It is time to finally bring the 
FDA into the 21st century. 
For the better part of a decade, Sen-
ator COLLINS and I have worked with a 
wide variety of stakeholders that rep-
resent industry, consumers, and health 
groups. Together, we introduce this 
Personal Care Products Safety bill 
with the support and input of these 
groups to implement commonsense and 
feasible measures. 
One of the most critical components 
of this legislation is providing FDA 
with mandatory recall authority over 
these products. Without this authority, 
the agency has few options to ensure 
consumer safety. 
For example, in 2019, the FDA discov-
ered asbestos in make-up marketed to 
children and teens at a popular chain 
store. After the FDA requested that 
these products stop being sold, the 
company refused to comply with the 
request. Lacking the authority to man-
date a recall, FDA was left with the 
only option of warning consumers not 
to use these products. This is simply 
unacceptable. 
Under our bill, the FDA could remove 
these harmful products from the mar-
ketplace—whether at your local phar-
macy or mall, or online. Perhaps even 
more importantly, our bill would set 
forth regulations to outline good man-
ufacturing practices for personal care 
products and prevent harmful products 
from ever being sold. 
Our bill would also require companies 
to register with the FDA so that the 
agency knows who is manufacturing 
personal care products and where they 
are being made before arriving in 
stores. Companies would also be re-
quired to disclose their list of ingredi-
ents, attest that they have safety 
records for their products, and report 
serious adverse events, such as infec-
tions that required medical treatment, 
to FDA within 15 days after being noti-
fied that one occurred. 
This bill would also require the FDA 
to evaluate at least five ingredients per 
year for safety and whether they 
should be used in personal care prod-
ucts. There would be opportunities for 
companies, 
scientists, 
consumer 
groups, 
medical 
professionals, 
and 
other members of the public to weigh 
in not only on the safety of particular 
ingredients but also which ingredients 
should be a priority for review. 
As I’ve said before, the ‘‘Personal 
Care Products Safety Act’’ is the result 
of many diverse groups working to-
gether to ensure businesses are able to 
provide the safest products possible to 
consumers. As such, this legislation 
also recognizes the needs of small busi-
nesses and provides flexibility to en-
sure they are able to comply with these 
new regulations while also upholding 
strong safety standards that protect 
consumers. 
I am pleased that this legislation has 
the support of a broad coalition, in-
cluding the Environmental Working 
Group, Beautycounter, Estee Lauder, 
Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Revlon, 
L’Oreal USA, American Academy of 
Pediatrics, American Cancer Society 
Cancer Action Network, the Associa-
tion of Maternal & Child Health Pro-
grams, the Endocrine Society, March 
of Dimes, National Alliance for His-
panic Health, the National Women’s 
Health Network, Au Naturale Cos-
metics, Burt’s Bees Company, The Clo-
rox Company, the Handcrafted Soap 
and Cosmetic Guild, and Procter & 
Gamble. 
I want to thank Senator COLLINS for 
her support as well as her staff for 
their hard work on this important leg-
islation. I urge my colleagues to join 
us in modernizing our outdated regu-
latory system for personal care prod-
ucts, and I hope the Senate will finally 
pass this long overdue legislation this 
year. 
Thank you Madam President. I yield 
the Floor. 
By Mr. PADILLA: 
S. 2103. A bill to amend the Revised 
Statutes of the United States to hold

June 17, 2021 
their officers lead to a violation of 
rights. 
This legislation would provide a right 
of action for an individual to sue a Fed-
eral law enforcement officer and agen-
cy for harm resulting from a violation 
of their civil and constitutional rights. 
42 USC § 1983 currently provides this 
right of action for state and local law 
enforcement officers who violate a per-
son’s rights. However, there is cur-
rently no statutory equivalent that ex-
tends this right to incidents involving 
federal law enforcement officers and 
agencies. 
Because Americans lack this right, 
there is a gap in accountability that 
urgently needs to be filled. This legis-
lation fills that gap by allowing indi-
viduals to sue federal officers, just as 
they can sue state and local officers. It 
would also allow individuals to sue fed-
eral law enforcement agencies. The 
United States Supreme Court has rec-
ognized that the federal government 
will not be liable in suit unless it 
waives its immunity and consents. 
This legislation recognizes the need for 
such a waiver. 
While extending this right will not 
automatically end all cases of abuse by 
certain law enforcement officers, it 
will give the American people an im-
portant tool to fight against injustice 
while also demonstrating that the time 
is now to address police brutality. 
While the United States Supreme 
Court has addressed the absence of a 
right of action against Federal officers 
before, the scope of the provided ‘‘rem-
edy’’ has been kept extremely narrow. 
Without a statute in place, this right 
will continue to be under-utilized and 
could disappear whenever the Court 
sees fit. 
Americans deserve better. We all de-
serve to have our constitutional rights 
respected, and we deserve a system 
that will hold bad actors accountable. 
This is too urgent a need to go 
unaddressed. 
Public safety is a two-way street. We, 
as citizens, honor our officers and trust 
law enforcement to keep our streets 
safe and peaceful. In return, we expect 
officers to be held to account for bad 
behavior. Anything less undermines 
public safety. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass the ‘‘Accountability 
for Federal Law Enforcement Act’’ as 
quickly as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
CASSIDY, Mr. BROWN, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, 
Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Mr. 
LEAHY, Mr. MERKLEY, and Mr. 
CASEY): 
S. 2108. A bill to amend title II of the 
Social Security Act to eliminate work 
disincentives for childhood disability 
beneficiaries; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, one 
topic there is much agreement on is 
the benefits of work, and our laws 
should support those who want to 
work. The bill I am introducing today 
will change Social Security so that 
parents and their children will know 
that working will never disadvantage 
them in the future. 
Let me explain the problem. Under 
current law, a child with a disability 
that began before age 22 may receive a 
Social Security benefit based on the 
work of a disabled, retired or deceased 
parent. Often the child receives this 
benefit for the rest of their life. Social 
Security provides the benefit because 
the child is usually dependent on their 
parents for financial support. The prob-
lem is that the law regards earnings by 
the child above $1,310 a month as end-
ing that dependency—even if the child 
is no longer able to maintain that level 
of work in the future. When that de-
pendency ends, the child ceases to be 
eligible for the benefit from the parent. 
Instead, the child would receive a ben-
efit based on their work. The benefit 
from the parent’s work is often signifi-
cantly larger than the child’s own ben-
efit. Because of this policy, parents of 
children with disabilities may prevent 
their child from working at their full 
potential, fearing that the work will 
cause the child to lose out on the larg-
er benefit. We need to change Social 
Security to ensure parents and their 
children that working will not cause 
them to be worse off in the future. 
To provide that assurance, I am in-
troducing the Work Without Worry 
Act. The bill ensures that any indi-
vidual with a disability that began be-
fore age 22 will receive the larger of the 
benefit from either their parent’s work 
or the benefit from their own work. 
Any earnings from work—no matter 
how much—will not prevent the child 
from receiving a Social Security ben-
efit from their parent’s work as long as 
the child is eligible for disability insur-
ance by the same impairment from be-
fore age 22. This legislation would give 
parents the assurance that their child 
with a disability can work without 
having to worry that the child will lose 
out on the full protections that Social 
Security provides. 
I want to thank Kathy Holmquist, 
President of Pathways to Independ-
ence, Inc. in Portland, Oregon, who has 
been a leader in my state helping peo-
ple with disabilities live and work with 
dignity. Kathy contacted me about the 
need for this legislation and I appre-
ciate her advocacy and support. Addi-
tional thanks to The Arc for the tech-
nical assistance and endorsement of 
the bill. The bill is also endorsed by the 
American Network of Community Op-
tions and Resources (ANCOR), Consor-
tium for Citizens with Disabilities 
(CCD) Social Security Task Force, Na-
tional Down Syndrome Congress, and 
The Association of University Centers 
on Disabilities. I am grateful that So-
cial Security Subcommittee Chairman 
JOHN LARSON is introducing the com-
panion bill in the House of Representa-
tives. The Senate bill is cosponsored by 
Senators CASSIDY, BROWN, KLOBUCHAR, 
SANDERS, LEAHY, MERKLEY and CASEY.

be printed in the RECORD.

SENATE RESOLUTION 274—DESIG-

TIONAL DAY OF THE AMERICAN 
COWBOY’’ 
Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. 
TESTER, Ms. LUMMIS, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. 
CRAMER, Mr. THUNE, Mr. ROUNDS, Mr. 
RISCH, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. INHOFE, and Mr. 
MARSHALL) submitted the following

Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 274 
Whereas pioneering men and women, rec-
ognized as ‘‘cowboys’’, helped to establish 
the American West; 
Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, in-
tegrity, courage, compassion, respect, a 
strong work ethic, and patriotism; 
Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies 
strength of character, sound family values, 
and good common sense; 
Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends 
ethnicity, gender, geographic boundaries, 
and political affiliations; 
Whereas the cowboy, who lives off the land 
and works to protect and enhance the envi-
ronment, is an excellent steward of the land 
and its creatures; 
Whereas cowboy traditions have been a 
part of American culture for generations; 
Whereas the cowboy continues to be an im-
portant part of the economy through the 
work of many thousands of ranchers across 
the United States who contribute to the eco-
nomic well-being of every State; 
Whereas millions of fans watch profes-
sional and working ranch rodeo events annu-
ally, making rodeo one of the most-watched 
sports in the United States; 
Whereas membership and participation in 
rodeo and other organizations that promote 
and encompass the livelihood of cowboys 
span every generation and transcend race 
and gender; 
Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in 
literature, film, and music and occupies a 
central place in the public imagination; 
Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; 
and 
Whereas the ongoing contributions made 
by cowboys and cowgirls to their commu-
nities should be recognized and encouraged: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 24, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Day of the American Cowboy’’; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4631 
June 17, 2021 
to the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs.: 
S. RES. 275 
Whereas the Federal Government discrimi-
nated against and terminated hundreds of 
thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘LGBT’’) individuals who served the United 
States in the Armed Forces, the Foreign 
Service, and the Federal civil service (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘civilian em-
ployees’’) for decades, causing untold harm 
to those individuals professionally, finan-
cially, socially, and medically, among other 
harms; 
Whereas Congress enacted legislation, led 
oversight hearings, and issued reports and 
public pronouncements against LGBT mili-
tary service members, Foreign Service mem-
bers, and civilian employees; 
Whereas the policy that led to the dis-
charge and systematic screening of gay, les-
bian, and bisexual military service members 
was codified in a 1949 decree by the newly- 
consolidated Department of Defense, which 
mandated that ‘‘homosexual personnel, irre-
spective of sex, should not be permitted to 
serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in 
any capacity and prompt separation of 
known homosexuals from the Armed Forces 
is mandatory’’; 
Whereas the Federal Government main-
tained policies to drive hundreds of thou-
sands of LGBT military service members, 
who honorably served the United States in 
uniform, including many who were fighting 
in wars around the world, from its military 
ranks; 
Whereas, in 1993, Congress enacted the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1994 (Public Law 103–160; 107 Stat. 1547), 
which contained the so-called ‘‘Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell’’ policy that prohibited lesbian, 
gay, and bisexual military service members 
from disclosing their sexual orientation 
while they served in the Armed Forces; 
Whereas, despite the ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell’’ policy, LGBT military service mem-
bers continued to be investigated and dis-
charged solely on the basis of the sexual ori-
entation of those military service members; 
Whereas historians have estimated that at 
least 100,000 military service members were 
forced out of the Armed Forces between 
World War II and 2011 simply for being 
LGBT, while countless others were forced to 
hide their identities and live in fear while 
serving; 
Whereas, although the ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell’’ policy was intended to allow qualified 
citizens to serve in the Armed Forced regard-
less of their sexual orientation, the policy 
was inherently discriminatory against LGBT 
military service members because it prohib-
ited those service members from disclosing 
their sexual orientation; 
Whereas, with the enactment of the Don’t 
Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (10 U.S.C. 
654 note; Public Law 111–321), Congress joined 
military leaders in acknowledging that les-
bian, gay, and bisexual military service 
members serve the United States just as 
bravely and well as other military service 
members; 
Whereas the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal 
Act of 2010 (10 U.S.C. 654 note; Public Law 
111–321) and the 2016 policy shift of the De-
partment 
of 
Defense, 
which 
permitted 
transgender individuals to enlist and openly 
serve in the Armed Forces, has made the 
Armed Forces stronger and more effective; 
Whereas military leaders have likewise ac-
knowledged that, in addition to lesbian, gay, 
and bisexual military service members, 
transgender service members also serve the 
United States just as bravely and well as 
other service members; 
Whereas, under the pressures of the Cold 
War, and at the instigation and lead of Con-
gress, the Federal Government also pursued 
anti-LGBT policies, which resulted in tens of 
thousands of LGBT civilian employees being 
terminated; 
Whereas the Department of State began in-
vestigations into employees for alleged ho-
mosexual activity as early as the 1940s; 
Whereas 
following 
Senator 
Joseph 
McCarthy’s targeting of gay employees in 
the Department of State in 1950, the Senate 
held hearings on ‘‘The Employment of Homo-
sexuals and other Sex Perverts in the Gov-
ernment’’, which— 
(1) led to the issuance of a widely read re-
port that falsely asserted that gay people 
posed a security risk because they could be 
easily blackmailed; and 
(2) found that gay people were unsuitable 
employees because ‘‘one homosexual can pol-
lute a Government office’’; 
Whereas, 
in 
response 
to 
Senator 
McCarthy’s allegations against gay people, 
the Department of State increased its perse-
cution of lesbian, gay, and bisexual employ-
ees; 
Whereas more than 1,000 Department of 
State employees were dismissed due to their 
sexual orientation, and many more individ-
uals were prevented from joining the Depart-
ment of State due to discriminatory hiring 
practices; 
Whereas thousands of lesbian, gay, and bi-
sexual individuals served honorably in the 
Department of State as Foreign Service offi-
cers, Foreign Service specialists, civil serv-
ants, and contractors, upholding the values, 
and advancing the interests, of the United 
States even as the country discriminated 
against them; 
Whereas the effort to purge gay and les-
bian employees from the Federal Govern-
ment was codified in 1953 when President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower issued Executive 
Order 10450 (18 Fed. Reg. 2489; relating to se-
curity requirements for Government employ-
ment), which— 
(1) defined ‘‘perversion’’ as a security 
threat; and 
(2) mandated that every civilian employee 
and contractor pass a security clearance; 
Whereas, over many decades, the Federal 
Government, led by security officials in the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Civil 
Service Commission (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘CSC’’), and nearly every other 
agency of the Federal Government, inves-
tigated, harassed, interrogated, and termi-
nated thousands of lesbian, gay, and bisexual 
civilian employees for no other reason than 
the sexual orientation of those employees; 
Whereas these discriminatory policies by 
the Federal Government, the largest em-
ployer in the United States, encouraged 
similar efforts at the State and local level, 
particularly in higher education and the pri-
vate sector; 
Whereas, in 1969, the United States Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir-
cuit ruled in Norton v. Macy, 417 F.2d 1161 
(1969) that— 
(1) ‘‘homosexual conduct’’ may never be 
the sole cause for dismissal of a protected ci-
vilian employee; and 
(2) the potential embarrassment stemming 
from the private conduct of a civilian em-
ployee may not affect the efficiency of the 
Federal civil service; 
Whereas, despite the decision in Norton v. 
Macy, the CSC continued its efforts to rid 
the Federal Government of gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual employees until 1973, when the 
United States District Court for the North-
ern District of California ruled in Society for 
Individual Rights, Inc. v. Hampton, 63 F.R.D. 
399 (1973) that the exclusion or discharge 
from Federal civil service of any lesbian, 
gay, or bisexual person because of prejudice 
was prohibited; 
Whereas many Federal Government agen-
cies, including the National Security Agen-
cy, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the 
Department of State, none of which were 
subject to the rules of the CSC, continued to 
harass and seek to exclude lesbian, gay, and 
bisexual individuals from their ranks until 
1995, when President Bill Clinton issued Ex-
ecutive Order 12968 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note; relat-
ing to access to classified information), 
which barred the practice of denying a Fed-
eral Government security clearance solely 
on the basis of sexual orientation; 
Whereas 
transgender 
military 
service 
members, Foreign Service members, and ci-
vilian employees continued to be harassed 
and excluded from Federal civil service until 
2014, when President Barack Obama issued 
Executive Order 13672 (79 Fed. Reg. 42971; re-
lating to further amendments to Executive 
Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity 
in the Federal Government, and Executive 
Order 
11246, 
Equal 
Employment 
Oppor-
tunity), which prohibited the Federal Gov-
ernment and Federal contractors from dis-
criminating on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity; 
Whereas, on January 9, 2017, Secretary of 
State John Kerry issued a formal apology for 
the pattern of discrimination against LGBT 
Foreign Service members and civilian em-
ployees at the Department of State; 
Whereas, despite persecution and system-
atic mistreatment by the Federal Govern-
ment beginning in the early 1940s though the 
1990s, including what historians have labeled 
as the ‘‘Lavender Scare’’, LGBT individuals 
have never stopped honorably serving the 
United States; 
Whereas LGBT individuals continued to 
make significant contributions to the United 
States through their work as clerks and law-
yers, surgeons and nurses, Purple Heart re-
cipients and Navy Seals, translators and air 
traffic controllers, engineers and astrono-
mers, teachers and diplomats, rangers and 
Postal Service workers, and advisors and 
policy makers; 
Whereas other countries throughout the 
world, including some of the closest allies of 
the United States, have apologized for simi-
larly discriminating against LGBT military 
service members, Foreign Service members, 
and civilian employees; and 
Whereas, in order for the United States to 
heal and move forward, the Federal Govern-
ment must accord all LGBT individuals who 
were discriminated against by, wrongfully 
terminated by, and excluded from serving in 
the Armed Forces, the Foreign Service, and 
the Federal civil service the same acknowl-
edgment and apology: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. 
The Senate— 
(1) acknowledges and condemns the dis-
crimination against, wrongful termination

and retirees, including LGBT individuals, 
with equal respect and fairness. 
SEC. 2. DISCLAIMER. 
Nothing in this resolution— 
(1) authorizes or supports any claim 
against the United States; or 
(2) serves as a settlement of any claim 
against the United States. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. Senator 
BALDWIN and I are pleased to introduce 
a resolution that acknowledges and 
apologizes for the mistreatment of and 
discrimination against lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, and transgender (LBGT) indi-
viduals who have served our nation as 
civil servants or members of the Armed 
Forces and Foreign Service. This sys-
temic mistreatment and discrimina-
tion of members of the LGBT commu-
nity began as early as the 1940s and 
continued well into the 1990s and is 
often termed as the Lavender Scare by 
historians. During this time, it is esti-
mated that 100,000 service members 
were forced out of the Armed Forces 
between World War II and 2011. In addi-
tion, more than 1,000 State Department 
employees were dismissed due to their 
alleged sexual orientation, and many 
more were prevented from serving due 
to discriminatory hiring practices. 
Policies such as the 1949 decree by 
the Department of Defense mandating 
that ‘‘homosexual personnel, irrespec-
tive of sex, should not be permitted to 
serve in any branch of the Armed 
Forces’’ led to the mass discharge and 
systemic screening of gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual military service members. 
Similar policies within the State De-
partment followed led to mass dismis-
sals and terminations of Foreign Serv-
ice and civil service employees. Subse-
quently, policies were enacted across 
the 
Federal 
government 
targeting 
members of the LGBT community. To 
this day, historians do not know the 
exact number of people impacted. How-
ever, despite these harmful and dis-
criminatory policies, LGBT people con-
tinued to faithfully serve and make 
significant contributions to the United 
States, many of whom became clerks 
and lawyers, surgeons and nurses, Pur-
ple Heart recipients and Navy Seals, 
translators and air traffic controllers, 
engineers and astronomers, teachers 
and diplomats, and rangers and postal 
workers. 
It is time to acknowledge the harm 
caused to these Americans, their fami-
lies, and our country by depriving 
LGBT people of the right to serve as 
federal civil servants, diplomats, or in 
the Armed Services. This Senate reso-
lution takes a stand on the side of re-
spect for LBGT Americans who have 
served our nation and reaffirms our 
commitment to treat all public serv-
ants with fairness and equality, regard-
less of their sexual orientation or gen-
der identity. I’m proud to introduce 
this Senate resolution during Pride 
Month to reaffirm our nation’s com-
mitment to treat everyone, including 
LGBT Americans, with equal respect 
and fairness. I will continue working 
toward 
advancing 
equality 
for 
all 
LGBT people in Virginia and across our 
nation. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

THEIR LOVED ONES, CARE PRO-

AND 
PERSONAL 
SUP-
PORT NETWORKS 
Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. 
MORAN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to.: 
S. RES. 278 
Whereas, in 1946, a group of returning vet-
erans from World War II in New York, New 
York, formed the organization now known as 
United Spinal Association to address the 
needs of paralyzed veterans; 
Whereas, in 1948, members of this organiza-
tion advocated for and secured the first ac-
cessible housing bill in the United States 
(the Act of June 19, 1948 (62 Stat. 500; Public 
Law 80–702)), which provided Federal funds 
for the building of accessible homes for para-
lyzed veterans; 
Whereas, in 1968, members of this organiza-
tion advocated for the passage of the Archi-
tectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et 
seq.), which guarantees equal access to feder-
ally-funded 
buildings 
and 
facilities 
for 
wheelchair users and all people of the United 
States with disabilities; 
Whereas, in 1970, James J. Peters, who 
would later lead United Spinal Association, 
exposed the deplorable conditions that para-
lyzed Vietnam veterans faced at the Bronx 
Veterans Administration Hospital with an 
article in LIFE magazine, leading the Vet-
erans Administration to establish a national 
spinal cord injury service office to address 
the needs of paralyzed veterans and the ren-
ovation of the Bronx Veterans Administra-
tion Hospital, which was later named for 
Peters; 
Whereas, in 1985, New York City settled a 
lawsuit initiated by United Spinal Associa-
tion, agreeing to make all city buses, key 
subway stations and commuter rail stations, 
and all new transit stations accessible to 
wheelchair users, and New York City estab-
lished a paratransit system for people unable 
to use mass transit, leading to a model that 
would be incorporated as part of the trans-
portation provisions of the landmark Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et 
seq.); 
Whereas, regardless of a person’s level of 
abilities, United Spinal Association seeks to 
build an inclusive world that— 
(1) 
removes 
barriers, 
particularly 
for 
wheelchair users; 
(2) embraces the talents of all people with 
disabilities to achieve their full potential; 
and 
(3) provides people with disabilities equal 
opportunities to pursue their interests and 
dreams; 
Whereas United Spinal Association con-
tinues to support and advocate on behalf of 
more than 2,000,000 people in the United 
States living with spinal cord injuries or 
neurological disorders, as well as veterans, 
through— 
(1) proven programs and services, and nur-
turing innovative self-reliance, advocacy, 
and leadership; 
(2) empowering its members, their loved 
ones, care providers, and stakeholders with 
resources, one-on-one assistance, and peer 
support; 
(3) promoting independence through em-
ployment opportunities and inclusion into 
mainstream society; and 
(4) advocating for greater disability rights, 
including access to health care, rehabilita-
tion, mobility equipment, transportation, 
community services, and the built environ-
ment; and 
Whereas the legacy of James J. Peters, 
who once described the straightforward 
strategy in advocating for people in the 
United States with disabilities as simply re-
fusing to accept no for an answer, is alive 
and well throughout United Spinal Associa-
tion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that throughout 75 years of 
service, United Spinal Association has made 
significant contributions to the lives of peo-
ple in the United States with disabilities, in-
cluding veterans; 
(2) honors United Spinal Association for its 
continued role in supporting and advocating 
for people with spinal cord injuries and neu-
rological disorders, as well as all veterans; 
and 
(3) commemorates 2021 as the 75th anniver-
sary of the founding of United Spinal Asso-
ciation. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 279—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 21, 2021 THROUGH 
JUNE 25, 2021, AS ‘‘NATIONAL CY-
BERSECURITY 
EDUCATION 
WEEK’’ 
Ms. ROSEN (for herself and Mr. CAS-
SIDY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.: 
S. RES. 279 
Whereas, according to a 2017 projection, 
the United States will face a shortage of 
1,800,000 cybersecurity workers by 2022; 
Whereas recent cyberattacks on the United 
States have highlighted the cybersecurity 
workforce shortage in the United States 
that— 
(1) poses a threat to the national security 
of the United States; 
(2) jeopardizes the economy of the United 
States; 
(3) puts the digital privacy of the United 
States at risk; and 
(4) threatens the critical infrastructure of 
the United States; 
Whereas 
expanding 
cybersecurity 
edu-
cation opportunities is important to address 
the cybersecurity workforce shortage and 
prepare the United States for ongoing and 
future national security threats; 
Whereas cybersecurity education can pro-
vide learning and career opportunities for 
kindergarten through grade 12 students 
across the United States, as well as bolster 
the capacity of the domestic workforce to 
defend the United Sates and secure the econ-
omy of the United States; 
Whereas, in 2020, introduced as part of the 
Providing Resources for Ongoing Training 
and Education in Cyber Technologies Act of 
2020 and enacted as part of the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 
116–283), Congress authorized the Cybersecu-
rity Education Training Assistance Pro-
gram, a Department of Homeland Security 
initiative to provide cybersecurity career 
awareness, curricular resources, and profes-
sional development to elementary and sec-
ondary schools; and 
Whereas ensuring access to cybersecurity 
education for all students in the United 
States regardless of race, ethnicity, socio-
economic status, or geographic location will 
expand opportunities for good-paying jobs in 
high-demand fields: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 21, 2021 through June 
25, 2021, as ‘‘National Cybersecurity Edu-
cation Week’’; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to acknowledge the importance of cy-
bersecurity education; 
(3) encourages educational and training in-
stitutions to increase the understanding and 
awareness of cybersecurity education at such 
institutions; and 
(4) commits to— 
(A) raising awareness about cybersecurity 
education; and 
(B) taking legislative actions to address 
cybersecurity education expansion and ad-
dress the cybersecurity workforce shortage.

AND OPPOSING ANY THREAT TO 
DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself

resolution; which was referred to the

S. RES. 280 
Whereas Colombia is among the oldest 
standing democracies in Latin America; 
Whereas the United States established dip-
lomatic relations with Colombia in 1822; 
Whereas Colombia is a constitutional re-
public where the people of Colombia hold the 
power and elect representatives to exercise 
that power; 
Whereas, after many years of violence and 
armed conflict, in 2021 Colombia is the 
strongest ally to the United States in Latin 
America; 
Whereas, with the support of the United 
States, Colombia has transformed itself be-
tween 2001 and 2021 from a volatile and near- 
failed state into a rich democracy with a 
growing free market economy; 
Whereas May 15, 2022, will mark the 10- 
year anniversary of the entry into force of 
the 
United 
States-Colombia 
Trade

nomic growth and employment opportunities

19 pandemic, including provision of excess 
vaccine doses to help revitalize the economy 
of Colombia; 
Whereas presidential and legislative elec-
tions were held in Colombia in 2018, and the 
people of Colombia elected Iva´n Duque 
Ma´rquez president in a second round of elec-
tions that impartial international observers 
considered free and fair and the most peace-
ful in decades; 
Whereas the United States and Colombia 
share a commitment to promoting security, 
prosperity, human rights, and democracy in 
Colombia and across the Western Hemi-
sphere; 
Whereas, in recent years, the Government 
of Colombia has taken courageous steps to 
enforce the law, stop drug traffickers, and 
rein in foreign terrorist organizations like 
the National Liberation Army (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘ELN’’) and the Revolu-
tionary Armed Forces of Colombia (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘FARC’’); 
Whereas the United States continues to 
support the efforts of the Government of Co-
lombia for peace, including protection of vul-
nerable populations such as Indigenous and 
Afro-Colombian communities, support for 
human rights defenders, provision of greater 
educational opportunities, increases in pub-
lic and private investments, especially in 
rural areas, and respect for human rights 
and the rule of law; 
Whereas the United States maintains a 
strong commitment to cooperating with the 
Government of Colombia to investigate, ar-
rest, 
and 
prosecute 
members 
of 
transnational criminal organizations and to 
dismantle terrorist groups like the ELN, the 
FARC, and Hezbollah, whose illicit activi-
ties, specifically narcotrafficking, devastate 
the citizens of Colombia and Latin America; 
Whereas, since 2016, the United States has 
provided more than $1,000,000,000 in direct 
and indirect support to peace implementa-
tion in Colombia; 
Whereas Colombia is an essential partner 
of the United States in continuing efforts to 
support the courageous people of Venezuela 
in their fight for freedom, democracy, and 
economic prosperity against the dictatorship 
of Nicola´s Maduro by generously hosting and 
providing aid to nearly 1,800,000 citizens of 
Venezuela as of June 2021 and by providing 
them essential services such as healthcare 
and education; 
Whereas, 
in 
February 
2021, 
President 
Duque issued temporary protective status 
with work authorization to citizens of Ven-
ezuela living in Colombia; 
Whereas the leadership of the Government 
of Colombia during the humanitarian crisis 
in Venezuela has been critical in organizing 
regional support for Interim President Juan 
Guaido´, as well as in denouncing the dicta-
torship of Maduro and helping implement 
policies to isolate his narcoterrorist regime, 
specifically through the Lima Group and the 
Organization of American States; 
Whereas the security situation in Colom-
bia has improved significantly between 2000 
and 2021, but the migrant influx from Ven-
ezuela and the economic effects of the 
COVID–19 pandemic have hurt the economy 
of Colombia, creating unique challenges for 
Colombia that demand action and support 
from strong democratic allies like the 
United States; 
Whereas freedom of speech, freedom to 
peacefully assemble, and other human rights 
are inalienable, and any acts of excess force 
against peaceful protesters should be con-
demned and investigated; and 
Whereas enemies of freedom, such as the 
communist regime of Raul Castro in Cuba 
and the Maduro regime in Venezuela, exploit 
and abuse the vulnerable and individuals 
simply asking for their voices to be heard by 
promoting violent unrest, vandalism, and de-
struction of property: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) declares its firm commitment to Colom-
bia, the strongest ally of the United States 
in Latin America; 
(2) opposes any effort to undermine the de-
mocracy or sovereignty of Colombia; 
(3) encourages the international commu-
nity to stand for democracy in Colombia and 
to condemn any efforts to undermine that 
democracy; 
(4) condemns any regime in any country, 
such as Cuba, Venezuela, or Iran, that gives 
aid to terrorist groups in Colombia by pro-
viding training, weapons, or funding, or by 
hosting those groups within the borders of 
the nation-state; 
(5) strongly condemns the terrorist attack 
perpetrated on June 15, 2021, and attributed 
to the National Liberation Army by the 
Duque administration, against the military 
base of the 30th Army Brigade of Colombia in 
Cu´ cuta, Colombia, the northeastern border 
city near Venezuela, where United States 
soldiers were present, at least 36 people were 
injured, and infrastructure of the military 
base was destroyed; 
(6) condemns any blockade of essential 
goods and services, including imports or 
transports of medicine or food, and strongly 
condemns all violence or attacks against in-
nocent citizens of Colombia or their private 
property or businesses; 
(7) recognizes that a stable and prosperous 
Colombia serves United States interests in 
Latin America; and 
(8) reemphasizes the shared democratic 
values of Colombia and the United States 
through free and fair elections with the 
peaceful participation of all political leaders 
and parties, accompanied by credible local 
and international observers, including in the 
presidential elections in Colombia in 2022.

HONORING REN HARRIS 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ren Harris, 
the 2021 Napa Valley Grape Grower of the 
Year, for his accomplishments and contribu-
tions toward our community. 
Born in 1941 in San Francisco, Harris is a 
sixth generation Californian. After attending 
Napa Valley College, the University of San 
Francisco, the University of California Davis 
and the University of Bordeaux, Mr. Harris 
began his career in the wine community in 
1967 as a grape grower and vintner. In the 
late 1960’s, Mr. Harris and his wife Marilyn 
moved from San Francisco to Oakville and 
began planting grapes on what was once a 
prune orchard. By 1975, they had successfully 
created the Paradigm brand, which is known 
and loved by residents throughout Napa Val-
ley today. 
Mr. Harris’s contributions to the wine com-
munity extend far beyond Paradigm Winery. 
His leadership within the industry is exem-
plary, having served as the President of the 
Napa County Farm Bureau, Council Member 
of the California Growers Board, Director of 
the Napa Valley CoOp Winery, and both 
President 
and 
Director 
of 
the 
Oakville 
Winegrowers. Additionally, he was the founder 
of both the Napa Valley Grape Growers and 
the California Grower Foundation. 
Perhaps the best testament to Mr. Harris’s 
dedication to Napa Valley and his fellow viti-
culturists is his extensive work throughout his 
career advocating for the protection of Napa 
Valley’s land, workforce, and community. 
Through the California Grower Foundation, he 
was able to help improve the working condi-
tions of viticulturalists as well as establish af-
fordable healthcare access for farmworkers. 
These contributions have made a lasting im-
pact on Napa Valley and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Harris is a community 
member we should all strive to be. His pas-
sion for viticulture and dedication to his grape 
growing community make him deserving of the 
Napa Valley Grower of the Year. It is therefore 
fitting and proper that we honor Ren Harris 
here today.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HERBERT 
KALINER 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn 
remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a 
great man, Herbert Kaliner, who passed away 
on June 1st at the age of 94. 
Herb was a cherished member of the Miami 
community. One of the last living survivors of 
Kristallnacht and the SS St. Louis, Herb was 
widely known and respected for his decades 
of 
engagement 
with 
community 
groups, 
schools, churches, and synagogues. He was a 
ubiquitous presence as a teacher and docent 
at the Holocaust Memorial on Miami Beach, 
where he spent every Saturday leading tours 
and educating generations of visitors about 
the Holocaust. 
Born in Germany, Herb was just 12 when 
he and his family fled the Nazi regime on ‘‘the 
Voyage of the Damned,’’ the tragic ocean liner 
which was forced to return to Europe in 1939 
after being turned away from the United 
States, Cuba, and Canada. When the ship re-
turned to Europe, about 250 of the pas-
sengers were killed in the Holocaust, including 
Herb’s parents and two sisters. ‘‘We were so 
close to Miami Beach, I could see it,’’ Herb 
told the Miami Herald in 1997. ‘‘I said to my 
parents, ‘Someday, I’ll come back here.’ ’’ 
Despite the odds, Herb survived the Nazi in-
vasion of France by hiding in the woods and 
working under false papers. In 1949 he immi-
grated to Miami and would go on to serve ad-
mirably in the Korean War, open a bakery, 
marry the love of his life, and raise a wonder-
ful family. 
Herb dedicated much of the latter part of his 
life to advocating for the rights, interests, and 
needs of Holocaust survivors, especially those 
living in poverty. As a member of the Holo-
caust Survivors Foundation USA Executive 
Committee, he often met with elected national 
political and communal leaders, even testifying 
before Congress to ensure the rights of Holo-
caust survivors to live in dignity. Despite the 
tragedy he endured, Herb never let his com-
mitment to justice waiver and is an enduring 
example of commitment, leadership, and serv-
ice. He will be deeply missed. 
Herb is survived by his wife of almost 60 
years, Vera; his daughters Debbie and 
Michelle; son-in-law Amir; and three grand-
children, Jessica, Zachary, and Jonah.

RECOGNITION OF MS. ALTHEA 
MARGARET DAILY MILLS 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Ms. Althea 
Margaret Daily Mills is an unsung hero in the 
fight for desegregation in Florida. Ms. Mills 
began her education in Pughsville, Winter Ha-
ven’s first Black community. When she was 
13, she moved to Pennsylvania to live with her 
aunt. There, she was able to attend integrated 
schools. In 1963, Mills filed a lawsuit against 
the Polk County Board of Public Instruction to 
end the ‘‘dual school system’’ and allow her 
son to attend the then, all-white, Winter Haven 
High School. This lawsuit eventually led to the 
integration of all Polk County public schools. 
When asked about her motivation to challenge 
the system, Mills would later say ‘‘Our instruc-
tors were just as good, but some of my son’s 
textbooks would go to page 3 and then skip to 
page 35. You can’t learn like that.’’ 
Ms. Mills also was the first black career em-
ployee of the United States Postal Service in 
Winter Haven and eventually became man-
ager of the Florence Villa Post Office. But as 
the first Black postal worker, her career was 
not easy. At one point, Ms. Mills was trans-
ferred to another post office, in an area known 
to be unwelcoming to Black people, in an ef-
fort to get her to quit. While the move was in-
timidating, she once recalled that her worst 
day was when a Black patron refused to buy 
stamps from her because she was Black. 
Although Ms. Mills passed away in 2008, 
her legacy lives on. C.A. Boswell, Jr., the 
longtime attorney for the Polk County School 
Board, said of his former opponent, ‘‘She was 
a good lady and had the best interests of the 
kids at heart, it was a different time. It took 
some brave people to hold that thing (the law-
suit) up.’’ 
The recognition of Ms. Althea Margaret 
Daily Mills is all the more special as we do it 
on June 17, 2021, on the first recognition of 
Juneteenth as a National Holiday. This 
Juneteenth is the 155th anniversary of the old-
est nationally celebrated commemoration of 
the ending of slavery in the United States. 
General Gordon Granger read General 
Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas which an-
nounced the freedom of the last American 
slaves. 
GENERAL ORDER NO. 3 
The people of Texas are informed that, in 
accordance with a proclamation from the 
Executive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
personal rights and rights of property, be-
tween former masters and slaves and the 
connection 
heretofore 
existing 
between 
them, becomes that between employer and 
hired labor. The Freedmen are advised to re-
main at their present homes and work for 
wages . . . 
By the reading of this order two-hundred 
and fifty thousand slaves were freed nearly 
two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln’s 
Emancipation Proclamation went into effect. 
We thank Ms. Althea Margaret Daily Mills 
on this special day and appreciate her efforts 
to make our community a better place.

HON. SHARICE DAVIDS

Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, in

June 17, 2021 
members of the International Code Council 
(ICC) to their roles in protecting our commu-
nities. 
With natural disasters only expected to in-
crease in frequency and severity, building 
codes include important safeguards to protect 
the public from tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, 
ice and snowstorms, wildland fires, and earth-
quakes. Last November, FEMA released, 
‘‘Building Codes Save: A Nationwide Study’’ 
and found that implementing modern building 
codes could save $600 billion in disaster 
spending by 2060. This further confirmed find-
ings from the National Institute of Building 
Sciences (NIBS) that show adopting modern 
model building codes save $11 for every $1 
invested through earthquake, flood, and wind 
mitigation benefits, with a $4 to $1 wildfire 
mitigation benefit. These benefits represent 
avoided casualties, property damage, busi-
ness interruptions, and insurance costs, and 
are enjoyed by all building stakeholders—from 
developers, titleholders, and lenders, to ten-
ants and communities. 
Vulnerable and underserved populations are 
most affected by increases in utility costs, and 
they often have the most to lose in the event 
of a disaster or health emergency. Building 
codes establish minimum requirements that 
ensure safe, resilient, and energy efficient 
schools, childcare and healthcare facilities, 
housing, and places of employment. 
Year round, building safety and fire preven-
tion officials, architects, engineers, plumbers, 
builders, tradespeople, laborers, and others in 
the construction industry work to ensure the 
safe construction of buildings though the use 
of model building codes. The dedicated mem-
bers of the International Code Council, a na-
tional 
standards 
developing 
organization, 
come together with local, state and federal of-
ficials to develop voluntary consensus codes 
that protect us in the buildings where we wor-
ship, live, work, learn, and play. The Inter-
national Codes, the most widely adopted 
building safety and fire prevention codes in the 
nation, are used by most U.S. cities and coun-
ties and in all 50 states, including the State of 
Kansas. I commend Johnson County, which 
makes up a large portion of my district, for re-
cently adopting the 2018 International Codes. 
During the pandemic, building and fire pre-
vention departments’ essential work has en-
sured that healthcare centers are structurally 
sound and capable of withstanding natural dis-
asters, and that temporary healthcare facilities 
providing medical surge capacity are built and 
maintained to protect occupant safety. These 
officials enforce state, local, and federal regu-
lations that require adequate ventilation and 
sanitization. More broadly, code officials pro-
tect the health and welfare of building occu-
pants to prevent dangerous sanitary, air qual-
ity, structural, or electrical hazards. 
In a Presidential Proclamation designating 
May 2021 as Building Safety Month, President 
Biden stated, ‘‘Investing in our infrastructure 
and adopting and implementing modem build-
ing codes are the most effective mitigation 
measures communities can undertake.’’ Build-
ing Safety Month was sponsored by the Inter-
national Code Council to remind the public 
about the critical role of our communities’ code 
officials in assuring us safe, efficient, and liv-
able buildings. This year’s Building Safety 
Month theme was, ‘‘Prevent, Prepare, Protect. 
Building Codes Save’’ and it encouraged all of 
us to raise awareness of the importance of 
safe and resilient construction, fire prevention, 
sanitation, disaster mitigation, and new tech-
nologies in the construction industry. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
International Code Council Board President 
Greg Wheeler, as well as ICC’s Chief Execu-
tive Officer Dominic Sims, the International 
Code Council leadership, and ICC’s Members 
and staff for recognizing Building Safety 
Month.

HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS

Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD remarks from the Amer-
ican Hellenic Institute on the Administration’s 
proposed FY2022 foreign aid budget and U.S. 
interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. In pro-
moting peace and stability in this critical re-
gion, Congress must authorize robust, Amer-
ica-first security assistance to our democratic 
allies in the Eastern Mediterranean—Greece 
and Cyprus. Any security assistance which 
counters U.S. interests, to Turkey and UN 
‘‘Peacekeeping’’ efforts in Cyprus, namely, will 
only serve to advance instability and ideolog-
ical expansionism in this region. Greece and 
Cyprus are key allies of our Nation, and we 
must continue to support their security for 
years to come. 
TESTIMONY
OF NICK LARIGAKIS, PRESIDENT, 
AMERICAN HELLENIC INSTITUTE (AHI), FIS-
CAL YEAR 2022 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, SUB-
MITTED TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES 
(By Nick Larigakis) 
I am pleased to submit testimony to the 
House on behalf of the nationwide member-
ship of the American Hellenic Institute 
(AHI) on the Administration’s proposed 
FY2022 foreign aid budget. 
The Administration’s budget aims to con-
front 21st century security challenges. The 
budget’s vision for the United States is to 
ensure it ‘‘. . . plays a lead role in defending 
democracy, freedom, and the rule of law’’ by 
recommending a significant increase in re-
sources to: ‘‘strengthen and defend democ-
racies throughout the world; advance human 
rights; 
fight 
corruption; 
and 
counter 
authoritarianism.’’ 
In keeping with the best interests of the 
United States, AHI opposes: (1) any proposed 
foreign aid and assistance to Turkey from 
the United States; (2) any proposed reduction 
in the aid levels for the UN Peacekeeping 
Force in Cyprus. 
Further, AHI recommends an FY2022 fund-
ing level of $1.5 million for NATO ally 
Greece’s International Military Education 
and Training (IMET) program as authorized 
for appropriation in The Eastern Mediterra-
nean Security and Energy Partnership Act. 
The Act also authorized $500,000 for the Re-
public of Cyprus’ IMET program for FY2022, 
which AHI recommends. In 2020, the U.S. De-
partment of State provided, for the first 
time, IMET program funding for the Repub-
lic of Cyprus. AHI welcomed this policy de-
velopment, and urges that this policy be con-
tinued. 
Finally, AHI recommends robust invest-
ment for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) 
assistance for Greece, in the amount of at 
least $10 million, due to its strategic impor-
tance to the United States as the House will 
see presented in this testimony. The East 
Med Act authorized appropriations of $3 mil-
lion for FMF assistance in FY2020. 
U.S. Interests in Southeast Europe and the 
Eastern Mediterranean. The U.S. has impor-
tant interests in southeast Europe and the 
eastern Mediterranean. It is in the United 
States’ best interest for the region to be po-
litically, economically, and socially stable, 
and for democratic principles to flourish, in-
cluding adherence to the rule of law. Signifi-
cant commerce and energy sources pass 
through the region. With Greece’s centuries 
of enduring presence, its close cultural, po-
litical, and economic ties to the Mediterra-
nean countries, including Israel; Western Eu-
rope, the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the 
Middle East, Greece is strategically situated 
in a vital region to be an ideal strategic 
partner for the U.S. 
America Values Its Alliance with Greece. 
Greece is an immensely valuable link as ‘‘a 
pillar of stability’’ in the region as several 
high-level U.S. government officials have 
noted. The U.S.-Greece relationship has 
reached new heights by virtue of an ongoing 
Strategic Dialogue, where avenues for co-
operation among many sectors, including: 
regional cooperation, defense and security, 
and trade and investment, among others, are 
plotted for implementation. Greece is a piv-
otal and dependable NATO ally to advance 
U.S. interests and is a frontline state against 
terrorism. The Mutual Defense Cooperation 
Agreement between the United Stales and 
Greece illustrates the two allies’ commit-
ment to address over a longer term the secu-
rity challenges in the region. The Agreement 
currently is under revision. After it is up-
graded, it will offer more flexibility to deep-
en cooperation in the defense sector, accord-
ing to Greece’s Minister of Defense Nikos 
Panagiotopoulos. For its part, Greece fur-
ther demonstrates its commitment to the 
Alliance as a top contributor to the defense 
efforts of NATO. Greece is estimated to 
spend 2.68% of its GDP on defense expendi-
tures in 2020 in accordance with NATO stand-
ards despite battling economic challenges. 
By percentage of GDP, Greece is second to 
the U.S. 
Greece is also important for the projection 
of U.S. strategic interests by being home to 
the most important U.S. military facility in 
the Mediterranean Sea, Souda Bay, Crete. It 
is a base from where joint USN/USAF recon-
naissance missions and air refueling support 
for U.S. and NATO operations were imple-
mented successfully, and it continues to be 
immensely important. In 2020, the United 
States homeported the Expeditionary Sea 
Base ship, the USS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Wil-
liams, at Souda Bay, assisting the U.S. 
armed forces in maritime missions and spe-
cial operations in both Europe and North Af-
rica. Military installations located at Souda 
Bay include the NATO Maritime Interdiction 
Operational Training Centre (NMIOTC) and 
the 
NATO 
Missile 
Firing 
Installation 
(NAMFI). To illustrate Souda Bay’s impor-
tance, these figures show the volume of oper-
ations conducted there: 
In 2020, at least 90 U.S. and 40 NATO (total 
130) ships made a port visit at Souda Bay. 
It also has been noted by U.S. government 
officials how Souda Bay allows United States 
Navy vessels—especially aircraft carriers— 
the ability to dock, make needed repairs and 
maintenance, and resupply, all within a cou-
ple of weeks and without having to return to 
Naval Station Norfolk. According to U.S. 
Ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, in a 
March, 20, 2021 statement: ‘‘Souda Bay is the 
jewel in the crown of US-Greece defense co-
operation . . . the unique capacities the

Souda provides to support US presence in the 
strategically dynamic East Med.’’ To further 
demonstrate that Greece’s value extends 
well beyond Souda Bay: 
NATO Joint-Command HQ: Thessaloniki 
hosts a NATO Rapid Deployment Corps com-
bined with its Third Army Corps for two 
years. 
Operation Atlantic Resolve: Greece enables 
a substantial portion of the U.S. Army’s 10th

pean

to

U.S. Army, from October–November 20, 2020, 
and from February–Mar 21, 2021, stationed 
and trained at Volos and Stefanovikeio. 
The U.S. and Greece held a joint military 
exercise in May 2021 as part of a larger 
‘‘DEFENDEREurope’’ program, which, ac-
cording to the U.S. Army, is ‘‘an annual 
large-scale U.S. Army-led, multinational, 
joint exercise designed to build readiness and 
interoperability between U.S., NATO and 
partner militaries.’’ Greece was one of only 
four participating countries whose port was 
used to deploy equipment into Europe and to 
host a ‘‘DEFENDER-Europe 21’’ logistical 
center. 
USAF temporarily operated MQ–9 Reaper 
Drones from Greece’s Larisa Air Force Base. 
Increased aircraft and soldier involvement 
at Stefanovikio Hellenic Army airbase im-
proves NATO transit capability. 
The trilateral naval exercise ‘‘Noble Dina’’ 
between the U.S., Greece, and Israel is held 
annually off of the coast of Souda Bay. 
Greece is also an active participant in 
peacekeeping and peace-building operations 
conducted by international organizations, 
including the UN, NATO, EU, and OSCE. In 
sum, it is evident Greece contributes signifi-
cantly to U.S. interests. AHI strongly con-
tends these actions justify a robust invest-
ment by the U.S. in Foreign Military Fi-
nancing assistance to Greece. 
Regional Instability. The successful pro-
jection of U.S. interests in the Eastern Medi-
terranean depends heavily on the region’s 
stability. A key to peace and stability in the 
region is for good neighborly relations 
among NATO members and respect for the 
rule of law. Therefore, the U.S. has a stake 
in focusing on the problems that are detri-
mental to U.S. interests and to call out 
those who cause instability in the region. 
Turkey is the fundamental cause of insta-
bility in the eastern Mediterranean and 
broader region: 
Turkey’s unilateral claims against sov-
ereign Greek territory in the Aegean which 
are in violation of international law, and 
Turkey’s refusal to refer its unilateral 
claims to binding international arbitration. 
Turkey’s aggression against Cyprus which 
includes its continuing illegal occupation of 
37.3 percent of Cyprus. 
Turkey’s numerous incursions into Cyprus’ 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), illegal 
drilling in Cyprus’ EEZ that were supported 
by Turkish warships and drones, and dem-
onstrated ‘‘gunboat diplomacy.’’ 
Turkey’s continuing violations of Greece’s 
territorial waters and airspace, numbering 
over 7,000 violations in 2020, which are in vio-
lation of international and U.S. law, includ-
ing the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). 
There were 4,605 airspace and 3,215 maritime 
incidents. 
Illegal 
immigration 
via 
Turkey 
that 
threatens Greece’s economic development 
and the peace and stability of Europe. 
The Turkey-Libya Memorandum of Under-
standing (MoU) on maritime borders, which 
has been resoundingly dismissed by the 
international community as illegal. 
Turkey’s open support for Hamas, and ac-
tive role in terror financing. 
Turkey’s exacerbation of the Nagorno- 
Karabakh conflict by encouraging Azer-
baijan’s aggression against Armenia, includ-
ing transiting Syrian mercenaries with ties 
to jihadist groups to fight on behalf of Azer-
baijan. The threat by Turkey of casus belli 
still stands, and Greece continues to register 
a considerable number of formal complaints 
over continued violations of the Greek air-
space and territorial waters by Turkey. In 
fact, Greece’s Chief of the Hellenic National 
Defense General Staff, General Konstantinos 
Floros, called out Turkey’s provocative be-
havior, stating to an AHI audience on April 
1, 2021, that Turkey threatens ‘‘Greece’s sov-
ereign rights.’’ In addition, Ambassador 
Pyatt has called the maritime border MoU 
between Turkey and Libya MoU ‘‘unhelpful’’ 
and ‘‘escalatory’’ in nature in previous pub-
lic statements. He also affirmed the inter-
nationally recognized legal concept that ‘‘in-
habited islands as a matter of customary 
international law are entitled to the same 
treatment as continental territory.’’ These 
reoccurring acts by Turkey are egregious, 
must cease, and unnecessarily cost the 
Greek government millions of dollars a year 
deal with the provocative actions of a NATO 
member country. 
Further, Turkey’s continuing occupation 
of Cyprus, its intransigence in solving the 
Cyprus problem, and its refusal to recognize 
the Republic of Cyprus (a prerequisite to 
Turkey’s E.U. accession process), which is a 
member of the European Union; are detri-
mental to U.S. interests and contributes to 
regional instability. To illustrate, Turkey 
insists on maintaining troop levels illegally 
on Cyprus, and President Erdogan’s pro-
motion of a two-state solution for Cyprus 
and support for illegally re-opening the 
beach in Varosha inflame tensions and are in 
violation of international law and United 
Nations Resolutions. 
In addition, Turkey’s actions regarding oc-
cupied Cyprus are deeply troubling. Turkey 
is transforming the former Lefkoniko Air-
port, located in occupied Cyprus, into a 
drone base, moving Bayraktar-TB2 drones 
onto the complex. From occupied Cyprus, 
these advanced drones are in range of Eu-
rope, North Africa, and the Middle East, pos-
ing a threat to regional security. 
Secretary Antony Blinken, during a Janu-
ary 19, 2021 hearing in front of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, stated: ‘‘Tur-
key is an ally, that in many ways . . . is not 
acting as an ally should and this is a very, 
very significant challenge for us and we’re 
very clear-eyed about it.’’ 
Turkey. Turkey continues to demonstrate 
it is not a true and dependable U.S. and 
NATO ally. The U.S. government, both exec-
utive and legislative branches, rightly sanc-
tioned Turkey for its procurement of the 
Russian-made S–400 missile defense system 
under 
Countering 
America’s 
Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in Decem-
ber 2020. Those penalties should be expanded. 
AHI calls for the continued inclusion of ap-
propriations language that direct the suspen-
sion of delivery or transfer of F–35 aircraft to 
Turkey until reports detailing the impact of 
Turkey’s purchase of the S–400 missile sys-
tem from Russia on U.S. weapon systems 
such as the F–35s are provided to Congress. 
Further, Turkey’s invasion of northeast 
Syria and attack upon U.S.-allied Kurds was 
not in the United States’ best interests and 
rightfully resulted in the passage by an over-
whelming vote in the U.S. House of Protect 
Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act to 
sanction Turkey for its actions. In addition, 
Turkey’s support for Hamas has been evi-
dent. 
President Erdogan has hosted Hamas’ top 
leadership, including individuals designated 
as global terrorists. In doing so, Turkey is in 
contravention of the Arms Export Control 
Act, which requires that the United States 
cannot supply arms to nations that support 
international terrorism. Hamas’ recent at-
tack against U.S. ally Israel only further 
highlights Turkey’s role as a malign regional 
influence. 
We oppose any foreign aid for Turkey and 
any other assistance programs from the 
United State. This includes most favored na-
tion trade benefits including textile quotas 
and the transfer of any nuclear related as-
sistance which we oppose as not in the best 
interests of the U.S. AHI applauded the 
United States’ decision to terminate Tur-
key’s designation as a beneficiary developing 
country under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) program, which became 
effective May 17. 2019. AHI has long argued 
for this type of action by the U.S. govern-
ment, especially in testimony presented to 
this House, until the following actions are 
taken: (1) the immediate withdrawal of all 
Turkish troops from Cyprus; (2) the prompt 
return to Turkey of the over 180,000 illegal 
Turkish settlers in Cyprus; (3) the Turkish 
government’s safeguarding the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate, its status, personnel and prop-
erty, reopening the Halki Patriarchal School 
of Theology, returning church properties il-
legally seized, and the reversal of Hagia 
Sophia’s status, returning it to a UNESCO- 
designated museum; (4) the cessation of vio-
lations against Greece’s territorial integrity 
in the Aegean and of its airspace; (5) the ces-
sation of illegal interference in the exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Cy-
prus; (6) Turkey must cease its support and 
promotion of a ‘‘two-state’’ solution regard-
ing Cyprus, in violation of United Nations 
resolutions and the position of the U.S. gov-
ernment; (7) Turkey must cease its egregious 
violations of important United States laws, 
in particular the Arms Export Control Act & 
the 
Countering 
America’s 
Adversaries 
Through 
Sanctions 
Act 
(CAATSA). 
Of 
course, Turkey’s ongoing human rights, free-
dom of speech, and religious freedom viola-
tions are problematic. 
Cyprus. The illegal military occupation of 
the Republic of Cyprus by 40,000 Turkish 
troops continues. As long as the Republic of 
Cyprus remains under Turkish military oc-
cupation, a strong UN peacekeeping force 
must be maintained on the island. Congress 
can assist the Republic of Cyprus by re-
affirming the United States’ position that 
assistance appropriated for Cyprus should 
support measures aimed at solidifying the 
reunification of Cyprus and the unified gov-
ernment in Cyprus. It would provide a settle-
ment, should it be achieved, with a chance to 
succeed. Therefore, AHI recommends the fol-
lowing language from Title III of the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act of 2012 be in-
cluded in the FY2022 State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Appropria-
tions bill: 
Assistance provided to Cyprus under this 
Act should foremost ensure that the United 
Nations 
Peacekeeping 
Force 
in 
Cyprus 
(UNFICYP) can fully implement its man-
date, while remaining available to also con-
tribute to the creation of a conducive envi-
ronment for the settlement talks under the 
auspices of the UN Secretary General’s Good 
Offices. Furthermore, in the event of reunifi-
cation, further assistance should be used to 
contribute towards the cost of reunification, 
including towards monitoring provisions, fa-
cilitation for settlement of the property 
issue, supporting and underpinning the new 
federal structures of a reunified island and 
assisting with the construction of a strong 
unified Cypriot economy able to cope with

the new challenges, and strengthening the 
contacts between the two communities as 
conducive to reunification, in a way agreed 
to between the United States and Cyprus. 
The last UN-led attempt, which took place 
in Crans-Montana in 2017, aimed to achieve a 
just and viable solution to the near 47-year 
division of the Republic of Cyprus, ended 
without reaching an agreement because of 
Turkish intransigence. Instead of helping to 
provide stability by promoting a just settle-
ment supported by both Greek Cypriot and 
Turkish Cypriot communities, Turkey con-
tinued to insist on antiquated and obstruc-
tive stances, such as its insistence to main-
tain the Treaty of Guarantee with a right of 
future unilateral Turkish military interven-
tion. 
More recently, during the latest 5+1 infor-
mal meeting in Geneva at the end of April 
2021, aiming to assess whether there was suf-
ficient common ground for the resumption of 
the 
negotiations, 
Turkey 
fundamentally 
changed its official position on the form of 
settlement of the Cyprus problem, insisting 
on a ‘‘two-state-solution’’ to solidify its oc-
cupation of the island, contrary to UN Secu-
rity Council resolutions and the stated posi-
tion of the United States government. 
Furthermore, Turkey hinders the humani-
tarian work of the Committee on Missing 
Persons (a previous recipient of USAID sup-
port) by denying access to areas under its oc-
cupation, including Turkish military zones, 
in order to excavate for the remains of 996 
Cypriots still missing (including four U.S. 
citizens) following the Turkish invasion of 
Cyprus in 1974. 
Congress should call on Ankara to con-
structively support the reunification efforts, 
in accordance with the UN Security Council 
Resolutions 
calling 
for 
a 
bizonal, 
bicommunal federation, as well as for a solu-
tion that embodies the full respect of the 
principles and laws of the European Union, 
of which Cyprus is a member state. The new 
state of affairs ought lo safeguard that a re-
unified Cyprus would have a single inter-
national legal personality, a single sov-
ereignty and a single citizenship. Finally, 
AHI welcomed Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken’s testimony to the House Committee 
on Foreign Affairs on March 10, 2021, where 
he stated ‘‘American diplomacy will be fully 
engaged’’ on the issue of a Cyprus settle-
ment. 
AHI is also concerned with energy secu-
rity. AHI contends the U.S. must continue to 
support the sovereign rights of the Republic 
of Cyprus to explore and develop the re-
sources within its EEZ free of any third- 
party interference and to underscore the im-
portance of avoiding any actions that esca-
late tension. As mentioned, Turkey’s threats 
in Cyprus’ EEZ endanger U.S. companies. In 
addition, Turkey’s illegal actions in Cyprus’ 
EEZ raise tensions and security concerns, 
hindering any real chance for the resumption 
of settlement talks. 
International Military Education & Train-
ing (IMET)—Greece and Cyprus. AHI rec-
ommends FY2022 funding for Greece’s IMET 
program at $1.5 million and the Republic of 
Cyprus’s IMET program at $500,000. The rec-
ommended funding levels are in line with the 
authorization of appropriations passed in 
The Eastern Mediterranean Security and En-
ergy Partnership Act. For Greece, the coun-
try experienced 11 fiscal years (FY2006– 
FY2017) of a steady decline of its IMET fund-
ing levels. It resulted in the drastic decrease 
in the number of Greek military students 
participating in the program. An investment 
of $1.5 million in FY22 will help address that 
11-year decline in funding, but more invest-
ment is needed to make up for ‘‘lost time.’’ 
For the Republic of Cyprus, which received 
its first IMET program funding in FY21, it is 
critical to continue this investment in FY22. 
It will be the next step in a series of positive 
developments since the Statement of Intent 
that the U.S. and Republic of Cyprus signed 
in November 2018. Since then, Cyprus has as-
signed a defense attache´ to the Embassy in 
Washington, the Cyprus Center for Land, 
Open-Seas, and Port Security (CYCLOPS), 
an innovative security site that has been 
partially funded by the U.S., is scheduled to 
begin operations in January 2022; and the 
U.S. implemented a partial lifting of an arms 
prohibition on Cyprus. The U.S. must fully 
and permanently lift its arms prohibition on 
Cyprus and remove Cyprus from the list of 
countries to which arms sales are prohibited 
under International Traffic in Arms Regula-
tions (ITAR) and calls for appropriations 
language to direct this of the U.S. Depart-
ment of State. 
The IMET program advances the profes-
sional military education of the Greek and 
Cypriot Armed Forces. It enhances inter-
operability with U.S. forces, and in Greece’s 
case, NATO forces. Through the training of 
Greek and Cypriot military and noncommis-
sioned officers in a multitude of professional 
military education and technical courses in 
the U.S., IMET offers strong U.S.-Greece and 
U.S.-Republic of Cyprus mil-to-mil relations. 
It is an effective and wise investment toward 
a key component of U.S. security assistance. 
It also helps the U.S. because it contributes 
toward the strengthening of U.S. security in-
terests in an important part of the world by 
training 
and 
promoting 
the 
professionalization of the Greek and Cypriot 
Armed Forces. 
Thank you for the opportunity to present 
them in our written testimony to the House.

IN HONOR OF COLONEL RALPH 
PUCKETT, JR., USA (RET.) 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to extend my personal congratula-
tions to an extraordinary man, leader, soldier, 
veteran, and true national treasure, Colonel 
Ralph Puckett, Jr. USA (ret.). On Friday, May 
21, 2021, Colonel Puckett was awarded the 
Medal of Honor, our Nation’s most prestigious 
military award, by President Joseph R. Biden 
for his valiant and commendable service to his 
nation. A dinner congratulating him on this 
momentous achievement will be held at The 
National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Geor-
gia on Friday, June 18, 2021 at 6pm. 
Before receiving this momentous honor, the 
Tifton, Georgia native had already established 
an impressive career in the U.S. military. Colo-
nel Ralph Puckett, Jr. graduated from the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point in 1949. As-
signed as an Infantry Lieutenant to occupation 
duty in Japan, he volunteered for the Eighth 
U.S. Army Ranger Company when the Korean 
War began. On November 25, 1950, the then- 
First Lieutenant began a multiday operation 
with the Eighth Army Ranger Company, a 
company of 51 U.S. and nine South Korean 
soldiers, against a plethora of Chinese troops 
on Hill 205. During the initial daylight assault, 
Colonel Puckett exposed himself to enemy 
fire, rallying pinned down U.S. troops to ad-
vance and take the hill from its defenders. In 
the following hours, temperatures dropped, 
and the Chinese attempted to retake the hill 
and Col. Puckett radioed in an artillery strike 
to stop the enemy’s advance. Over the course 
of six brutal enemy attacks, Colonel Puckett 
incurred severe wounds on his left shoulder, 
feet, thighs, and buttocks. Although severely 
injured, he was still able to command his com-
pany and call on artillery to avert enemy at-
tacks, before being carried to safety by two of 
his troops. 
Colonel Puckett was originally awarded the 
Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at 
Hill 205, but John Lock, a retired U.S. Army 
officer, and assistant professor at the U.S. 
Military 
Academy, 
discovered 
Colonel 
Puckett’s story and believed it met the criteria 
to be awarded our nation’s most prestigious 
military award, the Medal of Honor. In 2003, 
Mr. Lock began the strenuous process to have 
Colonel Puckett’s initial award upgraded to the 
Medal of Honor. After being met with unfore-
seen opposition, Lock submitted a petition for 
an upgrade to the Army Award Corrections 
Board. In 2020, the petition for Colonel 
Puckett was approved, and on Friday, May 21, 
2021, Colonel Puckett was awarded the Medal 
of Honor by President Joseph R. Biden for his 
valiant and commendable service to his Na-
tion. 
During his 22-year career, Colonel Puckett 
received several illustrious awards and com-
mendations for his outstanding leadership and 
heroic actions in the line of duty and on behalf 
of his fellow servicemen. To date, he has re-
ceived the Distinguished Service Cross twice, 
along with two Silver Stars for valor, two 
Bronze Star Medals, and five Purple Hearts. 
Similarly, in 1992, he became one of the first 
people to be inducted into the U.S. Army 
Ranger Hall of Fame. 
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm 
once said that ‘‘Service is the rent that we pay 
for the space that we occupy here on this 
earth.’’ As one of our nation’s most decorated 
military heroes, Colonel Puckett has paid his 
rent many times over and continued to give a 
prodigious amount of love and service back to 
his community following his military service. 
As a retiree, Colonel Puckett has remained 
actively involved with military affairs, including 
as a volunteer with the Ranger Brigade as 
well as serving as an executive with Outward 
Bound, a nonprofit educational organization 
that exposes students, especially those from 
cities, to wilderness settings. 
Colonel Puckett has accomplished many 
things in his life, but none of these would have 
been possible without the grace of God, and 
the enduring love and support of his wife, 
Jean; and their children, Martha and Thomas. 
Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues 
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 
more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s 
Second Congressional District, in recognizing 
and commending Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr. 
USA (ret.) on receiving the prestigious Medal 
of Honor and his lifetime of service to his com-
munity and his nation.

Reverend Wood, who I knew as ‘‘my moth-
er’s favorite cousin,’’ was one of seven chil-
dren born to Frank Wood, a hardworking car-
penter born into slavery, and Julia Wood, a 
dedicated and giving homemaker. They lived 
modestly on a family farm in Gloucester, Vir-
ginia. With nothing more than 25 cents and a 
commitment to serve, Reverend Wood entered 
adulthood at the age of 17. It did not take him 
long to begin his spiritual journey. He 
preached his first sermon as a senior in high 
school and shortly thereafter, became licensed 
by the church to preach in 1937. By the Grace 
of God, Dr. Wood was ordained as a Baptist 
minister only 3 years later. 
Reverend Wood devoted most of his life to 
serving the community around him. An inspir-
ing leader, he was pivotal in community serv-
ice and played a key role in the 1960’s Civil 
Rights Movement in Baltimore, marching 
alongside his noteworthy former classmate 
and lifelong friend, Reverend Doctor Martin 
Luther King Jr. 
Reverend Wood and I share the same un-
dergraduate alma mater, Morgan State Univer-
sity. By the end of his academic journey, Rev-
erend Wood had obtained two bachelor’s de-
grees, a master’s degree in divinity, and was 
bestowed the high honor of receiving a ‘‘Dis-
tinguished Alumni Award’’ from Crozer Theo-
logical Seminary. He was the last surviving 
member of his class at Crozer Theological 
Seminary—where he met Dr. King—to begin 
what was to be a personal connection to both 
Dr. King and his legacy. 
Reverend Wood carried what he learned 
from his academic pursuits and his peers into 
a career of visionary leadership and public 
service. From launching innovative techniques 
like opening solar-heated and ADA accessible 
church facilities, to developing the Providence 
Adult Day Care Center, no stone could be left 
unturned. He spread his love around the world 
and traveled to countries like England, Scot-
land, Russia, and Ireland to attend religious 
conferences. He made room to dedicate time 
to developing food programs, an AIDS min-
istry, prison outreach, and a committee for the 
homeless. He maintained memberships to dif-
ferent organizations, boards, and agencies 
such as the Baltimore Urban League, the 
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, the 
NAACP, and many more. 
Reverend Wood’s wife of 69 years, the 
former Bessie Pendleton, died in 2017. He 
leaves to mourn his passing a brother, Dr. 
Garnett Wood; daughter, Jeanetta James; 
son, Marcus G. Wood; and grandchildren 
Kevin Brown, Darrell Brown-Bey, Monica G. 
Wood and Melissa G. Wood Bartholomew; as 
well as two great grandchildren and a number 
of nieces, nephews and cousins. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, Reverend 
Wood disavowed any trappings or pretensions 
and lived his faith in God. He did not suffer 
fools lightly and was one of a kind. He was, 
as they say, ‘‘the Real McCoy.’’ Reverend 
Doctor Marcus Garvey Wood left a memory 
with every person he interacted with, including 
myself. May his soul forever rest in peace. 
MRS. JOSEFA FLORES 14-YEARS 
OF SERVICE RECOGNITION 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Josefa ‘‘Josie’’ Flores 
who is celebrating 14 years of service to the 
people of Texas Congressional District 12 on 
June 22, 2021. 
Josie was born a first generation American 
in Grand Prairie, Texas. She has a servant’s 
heart and a strong commitment to her faith 
and family. She is never flustered and has 
been a beacon of hope in my office and my 
district for the last 14 years. 
At 17, Josie joined the United States Army. 
Her 11 years of military service included a tour 
of duty in Bosnia, which she describes as one 
of her fondest memories. Upon returning to 
her husband, Jose, and firstborn son, Dee, 
Josie continued serving members of the 
armed forces in the fleet and family support 
center. Shortly after her second son, Leo, was 
born, Josie came to my office as a bilingual 
caseworker where she has been assisting 
constituents ever since. 
Josie is not just good at her job; she is the 
best at her job. People from all over the world 
contact my office in hopes of having Josie pick 
up their case because they know that if there 
is a way to do it, Josie will get the job done. 
Josie often says her job is to help people and 
helping people is what she loves to do. No 
matter the stresses involved, she does all in 
her power to help every individual or family 
that reaches out. Her passion for others has 
carried her on to be a successful caseworker 
with a wealth of knowledge that few, if any, 
can match. In addition to helping constituents, 
Josie is a resource for others in the congres-
sional casework community. She mentors’ 
caseworkers from all over the nation, sharing 
her experience and passion. The respect she 
has earned is a direct reflection of the work 
and dedication she has demonstrated to my 
office for the last 14 years, and during her en-
tire 25 years of public service. 
Josie will always provide an ear to listen or 
a shoulder to lean on. She is a sounding 
board for my staff and a lighthouse for my 
constituents. I have been beyond blessed to 
work with this incredible woman during my 
time in Congress, and I am forever grateful for 
her service to our nation. May her light never 
extinguish. 
On behalf of Texas’ 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my congratulations and best wish-
es on this special occasion.

JUNETEENTH NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE DAY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, as one of 
the original sponsors of Juneteenth legislation 
in the House, I am proud to stand with my col-
leagues in voting to make Juneteenth a na-
tional holiday. 
Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom, of 
our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. Of emancipation instead of dehuman-
ization. Of a message that made its way from 
Washington to Texas, freeing women and men 
upon its sight. 
It is our history, a reminder of deeds darker 
than death or night, and a debt unpaid that 
must still be made right. 
On this Juneteenth, I encourage all Ameri-
cans to reflect on the long walk to freedom, 
that took Union soldiers from sea to shining 
sea. Though we’ve travelled a long way, that 
walk continues today. 
And while I am overjoyed to send this legis-
lation to the President’s desk and make it the 
law of the land, the work continues. 
When Congress made MLK Day a federal 
holiday in the 1980s, it didn’t end the eco-
nomic injustice that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. fought against his entire life. 
In fact, the gap between rich and poor has 
only widened since then. 
So as we celebrate this victory for our his-
tory, we must remember that while Juneteenth 
marked a victory over slavery, it was only the 
start of our fight for voting rights and equal 
justice under the law. 
That fight, that long march to justice and 
equality and equity will not be over until we 
have fully protected the right to vote for all 
Americans, guaranteed equal justice under 
law, and achieved equitable treatment that re-
pays the debts of past wrongs. 
Madam Speaker, thank you for joining me in 
celebrating Juneteenth, thanks to everyone 
who worked so hard to make it a federal holi-
day . . . and never giving up the faith. 
God bless.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER 
OF JEFF VANDELEEST 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the career of retiring President 
and CEO of Family Services of Northeast Wis-
consin, Jeff VandeLeest. 
During his 25 years at Family Services of 
Northeast Wisconsin, Jeff VandeLeest served 
as Executive Vice President, Senior Vice 
President, and finally President and CEO of 
the organization. Mr. VandeLeest’s dedication 
and commitment to Family Services of North-
east Wisconsin and the people it serves is 
truly remarkable. 
Throughout his tenure, Mr. VandeLeest’s 
leadership and knowledge lead to the expan-
sion and long-term success of the organiza-
tion. Family Services of Northeast Wisconsin 
is a non-profit, human services agency that of-
fers more than 35 programs to people within 
Northeast Wisconsin during challenging peri-
ods in their lives. In 2019 alone, under the 
leadership of Mr. VandeLeest, Family Services 
was able to assist over 18,000 children, fami-
lies, and individuals through some of life’s 
most challenging transitions. 
For 25 years, Mr. VandeLeest has upheld 
the mission of Family Services; to protect, 
heal, and care. Throughout his 25 years with 
Family Services, the organization has grown 
exponentially. Mr. VandeLeest has been an

advocate for a wide range of services, from 
training individuals to handle the most trau-
matic of cases, to educating communities 
about prevention. Mr. VandeLeest’s expertise 
and knowledge in the services provided by 
Family Services will surely be missed by his 
peers and the entire Green Bay community. 
Prior to Jeff’s career at Family Services of 
Northeast Wisconsin he spent nearly 20 years 
delivering and managing juvenile justice serv-
ices. Jeff has dedicated his entire career to 
giving back to those in our community who are 
most in need. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Jeff VandeLeest’s 25-year career 
with Family Services of Northeast Wisconsin 
and wish him and his wife, Mary, all the best 
in retirement. His service and commitment to 
Northeast Wisconsin is deserving of the high-
est degree of recognition.

beat the Hallsville Bobcats by a score of two

Raithen Malone, a senior pitcher, was 
named the State Tournament Most Valuable 
Player. Six Eagles were selected by the Texas

HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Cathy Lewis upon the culmination of her 
time as host of WHRO’s HearSay. 
Twenty-five years ago, Cathy became the 
founding host of HearSay, WRHO’s flagship 
public affairs program. During her time with 
HearSay, Cathy has connected listeners with 
a variety of guests, from political candidates, 
to business owners, and civics leaders, includ-
ing President Barack Obama. Cathy has used 
her exceptional ability to lead civil discussion 
to educate audiences about governance and 
inform them about important issues in their 
communities. Her work has made Cathy a 
prominent voice in Coastal Virginia, and she 
has routinely made lists of the most influential 
individuals in the region. 
I am grateful for Cathy’s service and for the 
outstanding contributions that she has made 
to our community and beyond. Again, it is an 
honor to congratulate Cathy for her 25 years 
with HearSay, and I wish her the best as she

IN HONOR OF ANNA THOMAS 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Anna Thomas as the Greater 
Manchester Chamber of Commerce Citizen of 
the Year. Anna has worked in the Manchester 
Health Department since 1994 and currently 
serves as its Director. 
During her time at the Health Department, 
Anna has been a model public servant work-
ing on behalf of the residents of New Hamp-
shire’s largest city. Public health known no 
boundaries, and Anna has worked hard to 
build partnerships with a diverse group of 
stakeholders to address the needs of her city. 
Since the onset of the COVID–19 pandemic 
last year, Anna has served her community as 
the co-leader of the Manchester Emergency 
Operations Center, which coordinates munic-
ipal first responder agencies and resources. 
Equipped with a background in emergency re-
sponse and health promotion, Anna took swift 
action when the COVID–19 pandemic threat-
ened the health and well-being of Manchester 
and its surrounding communities. Alongside 
the dedicated public servants at the Man-
chester Health Department, which is only one 
of two standalone health departments in our 
state, Anna and her many partners have done 
a remarkable job managing the most severe 
public health crisis of our time. Now, as the 
Granite State continues its crucial vaccination 
effort, Anna has been an outspoken advocate 
for equity and expanding access to reach our 
most vulnerable residents. 
In addition to aiding public health efforts, 
Anna is also a proud veteran and active com-
munity member involved in a host of local or-
ganizations, including Veterans Count, Granite 
United Way, Mary Gale Foundation, and Bean 
Foundation. Anna works tirelessly to realize a 
brighter, healthier future for the greater Man-
chester area. 
During an unprecedented year of loss, Anna 
has embodied smart, compassionate leader-
ship benefitting our entire community. On be-
half of my constituents in New Hampshire’s 
First Congressional District, I congratulate 
Anna Thomas for being named Citizen of the 
Year by the Greater Manchester Chamber of 
Commerce and thank her again for her lifetime 
of public service.

RECOGNIZING FUNERAL DIRECTOR 
AND 
EMBALMER 
RAUL 
VILLEGAS, JR. 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Funeral Director and Em-
balmer Raul Villegas, Jr. (May 15, 1962—Jan-
uary 20, 2021). Mr. Villegas demonstrated 
never-ending patience and compassion to the 
families in his community during his life. 
Mr. Villegas was born in Laredo, TX and at-
tended J.W. Nixon High School. He then at-
tended the Commonwealth Institute of Funeral 
Service and graduated in 1986. After that, he 
served his 35-year career as a Texas Li-
censed Funeral Director and Embalmer dedi-
cated to the families of Laredo and Webb 
County, Texas. During this time, he was a 
great team leader and community member. As 
a funeral service professional, he met and ex-
ceeded expectations by having ceaseless pa-
tience and sympathy. Mr. Villegas had the 
right words for every situation and was reliable 
and strong even when those around him were 
undergoing difficult times. 
Mr. Villegas will have an enduring impact on 
his family, team members, and all of the fami-
lies in the community he served. He lived and 
worked his entire life by the principles of end-
less patience and kindness. I want to com-
memorate the life of Raul Villegas, Jr. and his 
numerous contributions to his community. As 
we move forward, let us take the time to ap-
preciate Mr. Villegas and his notable life and 
career. However, in the words of President 
John F. Kennedy, ‘‘As we express our grati-
tude, we must never forget that the highest 
appreciation is not to utter words, but to live 
by them.’’ 
Mr. Villegas is survived by his beloved wife 
Maricela G. Villegas; children, Raul Villegas III 
(Melissa Guerrero), Marlene (Fernando Garza, 
Jr.) Villegas, David (Anabel) Villegas, Danny 
(Michelle) Villegas, Ricardo (Jessica) Ramirez, 
Jr., Melissa (Salvador) Silva, Roberto C. Ra-
mirez (Vivian); parents, Raul and Hortencia 
Villegas; siblings, Irma (Wayo) Butron, Jerry 
(Lily) Villegas, Eddie (Juanita) Villegas, Javier 
Villegas, and Sammy (Anna) Villegas; 20 
grandchildren; as well as other family and 
friends. 
Madam Speaker, again I rise to recognize 
the life and career of Raul Villegas, Jr. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE GEORGE-
TOWN WATERFRONT ENSLAVED 
VOYAGES MEMORIAL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Georgetown Waterfront Enslaved 
Voyages Memorial Act. This bill would author-
ize the establishment of a memorial on federal 
land in the District of Columbia commemo-
rating the enslaved individuals who dis-
embarked at the Georgetown waterfront after 
forced migration to the United States by way 
of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. The com-
memorative work, to be established by the 
Georgetown African American Historic Land-
mark Project and Tour, would honor the 
enslaved individuals’ presence, celebrate their 
contributions to history, recognize their resil-
ience and fortitude and acknowledge their 
deeds and feats. 
This week, we recognize Juneteenth (June 
19), which marks the arrival of the news of 
emancipation to enslaved African Americans 
in Confederate-controlled Texas—two years 
after the Emancipation Proclamation was 
issued—the final end of slavery in the United 
States. Juneteenth celebrates the culmination 
of the long struggle for freedom from bondage 
in the United States. This monumental event 
prompts us to reflect on the past and look to 
the future. 
For four centuries, enslavers packed 12.5 
million captive Africans into their ships to sell 
as chattel in the Americas. The vestiges of 
this history are everywhere yet scarcely 
marked, including here in the District. The 
Georgetown waterfront had an extensive and 
long-neglected history of involvement in the 
slave trade. Due to its location at the northern-
most navigable point on the Potomac River, 
North Potomac, as it was then known, the 
Georgetown waterfront was a busy commer-
cial port that operated as a mid-Atlantic trad-
ing center of enslaved people. 
The first Africans were brought as slaves 
through the Georgetown port in 1732. Though 
records are incomplete, scholars have deter-
mined that between that year and 1761, seven 
ships carrying an estimated 1,475 enslaved 
people arrived there. Those who survived the 
traumatic ‘‘Middle Passage’’ voyage were 
marched through tunnels that led from the 
C&O Canal, through the sewage system, to a 
slave auction block on M Street, now George-
town’s main commercial thoroughfare. 
Commodities to be sold for profit, these 
people were assigned no more value in Amer-
ica than that paid for them by enslavers. Slav-
ery and the slave trade remained for genera-
tions an integral part of the United States. 
While the entire contribution of enslaved Afri-
can Americans in the District and region can-
not be determined, we know with certainty that 
white citizens and the federal government both 
relied heavily on enslaved labor to build the 
Nation’s capital. 
We must not hide from this history. The 
enslaved individuals, known and unknown, 
who disembarked at the Georgetown water-
front after forced migration, rest at the core of 
our Nation’s shared history. The atrocities of 
the system of chattel slavery shed light on our 
Nation’s central struggle between slavery and 
freedom—a freedom under which some could 
be owned, beaten, separated from their fami-
lies, and denied any rights. This bill provides 
for the creation of a powerful marker of truth- 
telling and remembrance. Let us honor the 
personhood of these individuals, who were re-
peatedly assumed to have none, so that they 
will never be forgotten. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE 
ANN ARBOR PEACE NEIGHBOR-
HOOD CENTER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the anniversary of the 
Peace Neighborhood Center in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan. Their 50 years of service to our 
community and its families is worthy of com-
mendation. 
In Ann Arbor, the Peace Neighborhood Cen-
ter has served children, families, and individ-
uals affected by social and economic chal-
lenges since 1971. The center seeks to foster 
a community of personal growth and oppor-
tunity to break the cycle of poverty and social 
inequality. 
In the past 50 years, more than 16,000 
members of the Ann Arbor community have 
participated in programs that enhance skills, 
promote education, and teach fiscal independ-
ence. Starting off as a place for community 
members to meet and discuss their concerns, 
the work of the Peace Neighborhood Center 
has expanded to after-school programs, jobs 
programs, substance abuse prevention pro-
grams, and so much more. 
A half-century after its founding, the Peace 
Neighborhood Center is a pillar of the Ann 
Arbor community. At the onset of the Corona 
virus pandemic, the organization shifted gears 
by expanding their food distribution program 
and later spearheaded the effort to vaccinate 
community members by setting up a vaccine 
clinic. With the help of their dedicated leader-
ship and their many enthusiastic volunteers,
