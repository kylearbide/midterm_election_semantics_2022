RECOGNIZING RION-BOWMAN VFW 
POST 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Rion-Bowman 
VFW Post in Harrisonburg, Virginia, 
which recently celebrated its 100th an-
niversary. 
Founded in 1921, VFW Post 632 was 
the first Veterans of Foreign War chap-
ter founded in the Shenandoah Valley 
and is one of the oldest in the Com-
monwealth of Virginia. 
Combat veterans of every conflict 
since World War I have called this post 
home, and it has been led by 73 dedi-
cated commanders over the years. 
Current 
Senior 
Vice 
Commander 
Christopher Rexrode noted the signifi-
cance of celebrating this milestones 
during the pandemic, which has forced 
far too many veterans’ clubs across the 
country to close. He is thankful his 
post has been able to keep its doors 
open and continue to serve as a place 
for veterans to gather, connect, and 
share experiences and comradery on a 
daily basis. 
Congratulations to VFW Post 632 on 
this great achievement, and I wish 
them another 100 years of success. 
f 
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ESHOO). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in the name of liberty and jus-
tice for all. I rise in the name of liberty 
and justice for all because the criminal 
justice system is on trial. It is on trial 
in the court of world opinion. It is on 
trial for crimes committed against 
human beings in this country. 
Some of the complainants would in-
clude 
Eric 
Garner, 
Tamir 
Rice, 
Breonna Taylor, George Floyd. 
I rise in the name of liberty and jus-
tice for all because we have reached a 
point in our history wherein there is 
one case now that seems to have 
reached the pinnacle of the system, 
such that everyone is waiting to see 
how this case will eventually address 
liberty and justice for all. 
One of the complaints is that in this 
country we have allowed arresting offi-
cers, that we confer enormous power 
on, literally, the power to execute 
when necessary. 
But the question is: Will these arrest-
ing officers not only have the power to 
arrest, but also the power to be judge, 
jury, prosecutor, and executioner? 
This is the question before the court 
of world opinion. 
We have a case that embraces dec-
ades, perhaps even centuries of mis-
deeds. My hope is that we will receive 
a just ruling. My prayer is that, if 
there is not a just ruling, we will have 
peaceful protests. I believe in peaceful 
protests. I have gone to jail partici-
pating in peaceful protests. I have gone 
to jail with John Lewis participating 
in peaceful protests. Twice, he and I 
were jailed together. 
So I rise in the name of liberty and 
justice for all, understanding that we 
have an opportunity now to dem-
onstrate to the world that we will not 
allow an arresting officer to be judge, 
jury, prosecutor, and executioner. But 
I also understand, given the history of 
this 
country, 
unfortunately, 
that 
things don’t always work out as I be-
lieve they should. 
So my hope is that there will be 
peaceful protests, but I do hope that 
the protests will take place if there is 
not a just verdict. There is nothing 
wrong with peaceful protests in this 
country. There is nothing wrong with 
confronting injustice in this country. 
There is nothing wrong with standing 
up for the rights of those who are being 
denied liberty and justice for all in this 
country. 
I want to see peaceful protests if the 
wrong verdict is rendered. And, in my 
opinion, the verdict that we should 
have is arresting officers can’t be 
judge, jury, prosecutor, and execu-
tioner. There are those who would say 
that I don’t have the right to come to 
these conclusions at this time, and 
they are wrong. 
In the court of public opinion, world 
opinion, many have already come to 
this same conclusion. I am merely 
echoing what they have said. As such, 
I am a messenger, and the message is: 
Let’s pray for a just decision in the 
court of world opinion.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDGE 
HARRY WALKER WELLFORD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Judge Harry Walker Wellford, who 
passed away Saturday, April 17. 
Judge Wellford was a third-genera-
tion Memphian, who dedicated his life 
to serving his community through the

justice system, and also dedicated his 
life to his family. 
Judge Wellford started serving his 
community in our great country at a 
young age. Like so many of his genera-
tion, the Greatest Generation, Harry 
served our Nation fighting in the Pa-
cific theater during World War II. After 
serving our Nation overseas, Harry 
Wellford returned to his home State of 
Tennessee to obtain his law degree 
from Vanderbilt University. 
In the 1960s, a turbulent time for our 
Nation 
and 
for 
Memphis, 
Harry 
Wellford was an active member of the 
biracial 
Memphis 
Relations 
Com-
mittee, serving for the betterment of 
the Memphis community. 
It was during this time that Harry 
Wellford 
became 
politically 
active, 
leading the west Tennessee efforts for 
Howard 
Baker’s 
campaign 
for 
the 
United States Senate; and then, in 1970, 
managing the Statewide campaign for 
his good friend, Winfield Dunn, to be-
come Governor of Tennessee. 
Harry had a good and successful law 
practice and was well-regarded in the 
legal community. It was for these rea-
sons that Harry was nominated for a 
Federal judgeship in 1970 by then-Presi-
dent Richard Nixon. Judge Wellford 
was unanimously confirmed as district 
court judge. Later, President Ronald 
Reagan nominated Judge Wellford for 
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, to 
which he was confirmed. 
Judge Wellford had a long and distin-
guished career on the bench. A good 
friend of Judge Wellford was Judge 
Julia Gibbons, who currently serves on 
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and, 
in 1982, replaced Judge Wellford on the 
district court when he was elevated to 
the appellate court. Commenting on 
him yesterday, Judge Gibbons said: 
Harry Wellford was one of the people 
we most admire to become; he was my 
friend; his touch with people emanated 
in everything he did in life. 
Madam Speaker, Harry and his wife, 
Katherine, were members of Idlewild 
Presbyterian Church before she passed 
away. They loved to travel, and he en-
joyed spending his free time playing 
tennis and golf. Despite being a well- 
distinguished judge and a political re-
former for the State of Tennessee, 
what mattered most to Harry was his 
family. 
Judge Wellford’s favorite song was 
‘‘Eternal Father Strong to Save,’’ more 
commonly 
known 
as 
‘‘The 
Navy 
Hymn.’’ So appropriate for him and for 
his generation. 
Indeed, Harry Wellford will be sorely 
missed by all who knew him. Today, 
Roberta and I are thinking about Harry 
and his five children: Harry, Jr.; 
Beasley; Buck; Kate; and Allison. 
Harry Wellford, thank you for your 
service to our great Nation. 
f 
THE EXONERATED FIVE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, April 19, marked the 32nd 
anniversary of a terrible assault, a sex-
ual assault in Central Park that 
marked the history and marked really 
the story of New York City. 
But it was also one that resulted in 
the wrongful arrest and conviction of 
five young Black and Latino boys for a 
crime that they did not commit. For 
years, they were known as the Central 
Park Five. But after years of injustice 
and now long after being exonerated, 
they are now known as the Exonerated 
Five. 
These young men were minors. They 
were really young boys who were inno-
cent of every single crime they were 
charged of, and still spent from 6 to 13 
years behind bars. They have faced a 
horrendous story. 
They have names. They have faces. 
They have first names and last names, 
and they are: Antron McCray, Kevin 
Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond 
Santana, and Korey Wise. They will be 
here in the Capitol, Madam Speaker, 
tomorrow. 
Each one of these young men were 
deprived of their childhoods, of their 
innocence, and, most important, of 
their future. Racial bias and bigotry 
were at the crux of these young men 
being deprived of their civil liberties. 
It is an old tale. 
These young men aren’t alone in 
their stories. They are the stories of so 
many young Black men, Brown men, 
and Black and Brown young women in 
our country. As we brace for a court 
decision, Madam Speaker, they will be 
visiting the Capitol as free men tomor-
row. 
But this isn’t a story just of misfor-
tune. It is also a story of resilience, the 
resilience of little boys who were 
turned into men far too soon; the resil-
ience of a community that never 
stopped fighting for justice, including 
grassroots 
organizing 
and 
Council 
Member Bill Perkins; and the resil-
ience of those that continue to fight 
today, continue to fight for change, 
and continue to fight for a new just 
criminal justice system. 
This is an opportune debate, Madam 
Speaker, as we brace for a court deci-
sion that we hope will be just and that 
the Nation will be in peace; a criminal 
justice system that, today, often crim-
inalizes far too many Black and Brown 
young people. 
We see stories like theirs replay in 
the evening news each and every day. 
So we must never forget. When we see 
another Black and Brown young man 
being targeted, pulled over, handcuffed, 
shot to death in the street, knees on 
their necks, all while they are inno-
cent, we know that this is not justice. 
That is why we need to continue in 
our fight transforming policing in our 
country. We know that is not justice. 
We cannot allow law enforcement to 
get away with use of excessive force on 
many young people across this country 
and ruining their futures. We know 
that is not justice. 
End the choke hold. End the no- 
knock warrants. Transform our crimi-
nal justice system. End over-policing 
of Black and Brown people. Abolish the 
death penalty. Dismantle the institu-
tions that are rooted in white suprem-
acy. 
b 1015 
No one should have to lose their life 
or be robbed of their future, Madam 
Speaker, because we didn’t step up and 
fix our broken system. We know that is 
not justice. 
Madam Speaker, 32 years ago, five 
young men from Harlem were robbed of 
their future, but alas they rose above 
and stand tall today as leaders, advo-
cates, and activists fighting tirelessly 
to reimagine how we see justice in our 
country. They have given back to their 
communities and to our country, and 
we thank them for their perseverance, 
for using their voices for change and 
for coming here to this Capitol tomor-
row. 
I hope that we use this anniversary 
on both sides of the aisle as a reminder 
of how much work still needs to be 
done to transform our institutions to 
serve every single one of us.

HONORING JOANNE POWELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and sac-
rifice of Mrs. JoAnne Powell, a pillar of 
the San Angelo community and one of 
the most distinguished public servants 
in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
JoAnne served the constituents of 
the 11th District of Texas for over 35 
years in the San Angelo office. During 
this time, she solved thousands of cases 
with Federal agencies, helped thou-
sands of people, and was the eyes and 
ears of the office on the ground and 
throughout our district. 
Her pride and joy in mentoring hun-
dreds of men and women who would 
later go to service academies truly 
changed our Nation and our military 
service. She trained four Congressmen 
over her tenure: TOM LOEFFLER, LAMAR 
SMITH, MIKE CONAWAY, and now myself. 
It has been a priceless honor to have 
her mentorship and her guidance as I 
begin my journey in Congress. 
On top of her congressional service, 
the influence she and her beloved hus-
band, Colonel Powell, have had on our 
community cannot be overstated. She 
married 
her 
childhood 
sweetheart, 
Charles Powell, in December 1954, just 
months after his graduation from the 
U.S. Naval Academy. Charles would go 
on to become a colonel in the U.S. Air 
Force and the two would take a long 
journey and a successful journey in 
service to this country before settling 
in San Angelo in 1980 when Colonel 
Powell became the wing commander of 
Goodfellow. 
At that time, the base was scheduled 
for closure. Both Colonel Powell and

JoAnne were instrumental in making 
sure that that mission of training our 
intelligence personnel in the Air Force, 
the Marines, the Army, and the Navy 
continued to become one of the most 
important in the United States. 
When she settled in San Angelo, Jo-
Anne became one of the most involved 
members of the Concho Valley commu-
nity and received many honors for 
serving on boards and for her philan-
thropic and organizational leadership. 
She was the epitome of service before 
self, working hard and handling case-
work right up until the week before she 
passed away. 
She genuinely cared for every single 
person and showed Christ’s love to ev-
erybody she encountered. I cannot ex-
press how great this loss is to our team 
and the entire 11th District. 
JoAnne and Colonel Powell, we will 
miss you. 
HONORING GREGORIO GUTIERREZ 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the life and the service of 
Gregorio Gutierrez, a man with a serv-
ant’s heart, a strong faith in God, and 
an unmatched ability to connect with 
all sorts of people. 
Born in Mexico, Gregorio came to the 
United States in 1984; married his wife, 
Araceli, in 1990; and earned his citizen-
ship in 2000. He followed his passion 
and founded Conexion San Angelo, the 
area’s first and only bilingual news or-
ganization. Since then he has expanded 
throughout west Texas, and his oper-
ation still lives today. 
He was an amazing man with a 
strong legacy that will live on through 
his wife, Araceli; his son, Ricardo; and 
all who know him. 
San Angelo has honored Gregorio and 
his family with Gregorio Gutierrez Day 
which will fall every year on January 
23. His family should be proud of his 
amazing legacy and his service to the 
Spanish-speaking 
community, 
the 
members of San Angelo, and all of the 
Concho Valley. 
HONORING J.C. CAMPBELL 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of J.C. Campbell, a valued member of 
the Granbury community who passed 
away on March 30, 2021. 
He served our country admirably in 
the U.S. Navy during the Korean war 
aboard the USS Frank E. Evans. After 
coming home, he met and married Syl-
via, the love of his life, at North Texas 
State, and they moved to Granbury in 
1960 and have called it home ever since. 
He has given much of himself to our 
community 
with 
positions 
on 
the 
Granbury City Council, the volunteer 
fire department, the Granbury Masonic 
Lodge, the Bluff Dale Lodge, and as 
president of the USS Frank E. Evans 
Association, helping to tell the story of 
the ship he once sailed aboard. 
He was an incredible friend to stu-
dents and staff and a regular fixture at 
school board meetings. He was a men-
tor to many and known as the commu-
nity’s biggest cheerleader. 
Madam Speaker, I know his family 
and friends will miss him terribly, and 
his loss will be felt deeply in Granbury 
and throughout the 11th District. 
Thank you for your service, J.C. 
HONORING THE LIPAN GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the Lipan girls basketball 
team who recently won the AA State 
Championship in Texas. 
To Coach Amber Branson and the en-
tire team, congratulations on yet an-
other victory and yet another State 
championship. 
f 
RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN 
GENOCIDE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, an 
open letter to President Joseph Biden: 
Mr. President, in just 5 days, the 
world will mark the 106th anniversary 
of the beginning of the Armenian geno-
cide, the systematic murder and dis-
placement of 1.5 million Armenian 
women, men, and children by the Otto-
man Empire from 1915 to 1923. This will 
be the first April 24 of your Presidency 
and your first opportunity to follow 
through on your promise to recognize 
the genocide and your decades of lead-
ership on this issue. 
On behalf of hundreds of thousands of 
Armenian Americans, the children, 
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren 
of genocide survivors, I ask you to keep 
that promise and recognize the Arme-
nian genocide. 
The facts of the genocide are not in 
serious dispute. They were recorded in 
real time by American diplomats who 
lacked a name for the barbaric and sys-
tematic extermination of the Arme-
nian people but knew that it was with-
out precedent in human history. Mil-
lions of Armenians were beaten, raped, 
killed, and marched across deserts by 
the Ottoman Empire. 
From the blood and rubble, the Ar-
menian people survived. Tens of thou-
sands of orphaned children owe their 
lives to the generosity of Americans 
who created the Near East Relief Foun-
dation. Those children and their de-
scendants crossed the ocean to build 
lives in Los Angeles and across the Na-
tion. 
You know these facts well, and you 
have spoken about them directly, in-
cluding as a candidate for President. 
As President, it is now in your power 
to help right decades of denial and in 
so doing give meaning to your state-
ment last year when you acknowledged 
the genocide and said that silence is 
complicity. 
As a candidate and now as President, 
you have spoken of your commitment 
to human rights. You have spoken of 
an America who leads not by example 
of our power, but by the power of our 
example. If that principle is to have 
meaning, we cannot waver from it just 
because it may be inconvenient. 
The word genocide is significant be-
cause genocide is not a problem of the 
past, it is a problem of today, including 
in Xinjiang where Uighurs face a re-
lentless campaign by the Chinese Com-
munist Party to wipe out their culture. 
And it is a danger today in Artsakh 
where Turkey assisted Azerbaijan in 
making war on the Armenians again, 
and in so doing, threaten another po-
tential genocide. What a comfort it 
would be to the perpetrators of crimes 
against humanity in the present day if 
the most powerful nation on Earth 
could be cowed into silence about the 
events of a century ago. 
In recognizing the genocide, you will 
be joining both the House and the Sen-
ate who voted overwhelmingly in 2019 
to do so. 
Mr. President, we must not resort to 
euphemisms or half-truths. The murder 
of 1.5 million Armenians was an atroc-
ity—that is surely true—but it was 
more than that. The act of seeking to 
destroy a people and a culture is a dif-
ferent kind of evil, and it was not until 
Raphael Lemkin coined the term geno-
cide that we had a word to describe it. 
Millions of Armenians, in Yerevan 
and across the world, tens of thousands 
of my constituents, Mr. President, will 
look to you later this week to see if 
you will join leaders in France, Ger-
many, the European Union, the Vati-
can, and in 49 States in recognizing the 
genocide. 
It is my deepest wish that you will 
speak the truth in all of its horror and 
recognize the Armenian genocide.

HONORING JEN DAULBY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of ILLINOIS. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in a bit-
tersweet time in my career here in 
Congress because it is a time I get to 
bid farewell to somebody who has been 
with me since day one. Because she has 
floor privileges, she is sitting behind 
me right now and is going to be very 
embarrassed because I am going to talk 
about her. 
As you can see here, Madam Speaker, 
this is my longtime chief of staff and 
staff director of the House Administra-
tion Committee, Jen Daulby, and her 
daughter, Reagan, standing in the Cap-
itol rotunda. 
I first met Jen in Illinois when she 
was a young intern for the State of Illi-
nois one summer. Little did I know 
that a few years later I would be run-
ning a campaign for my former boss, 
Congressman JOHN
SHIMKUS, and I 
would hire a field office manager who 
just graduated law school to work out 
of our Collinsville, Illinois, campaign 
office. I realized very, very quickly she 
had opinions of her own—something 
that in political campaigns sometimes 
are a little difficult because as a cam-
paign manager, I wanted to be right all 
the time. But she always taught me: 
get this stuff done and get me the in-
formation I need so I can do my job. 
Jen Daulby sitting behind me was a 
pain in my butt during that campaign.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1960 
April 20, 2021 
Fast forward: we got a chance to work 
together in the Shimkus congressional 
office. Then she went on to bigger and 
brighter things working for then-Chair-
man Goodlatte on the House Agri-
culture Committee, and then to top it 
off she had to work for Chairman SEN-
SENBRENNER
on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. Then as luck would have it, in 
2012 I won the closest Republican vic-
tory in the Nation. Jen was already 
making a name for herself in the pri-
vate sector, but she wanted to come 
back to the Hill and be a chief of staff. 
I remember how painful she was to 
work with when we worked together on 
that campaign, and I just threw her in 
as an interview because I knew her. If 
there was a fifth slot and I was only 
interviewing four, she would have got 
it. 
But do you know what? 
She came in with a plan. She wowed 
my wife, who was in the interview with 
me, and my district director, who was 
in the interview with me, and reminded 
me how special of a person she was. 
Jen likes to say: Thank you for tak-
ing a chance on a single mom with a 4- 
year-old daughter at the time to come 
back to the Hill and be a part of this 
institution, because it was her dream 
to lead an office. 
She has got it all wrong once again, 
because I am glad she took a chance on 
me as a new Member of Congress who 
won by only 1,002 votes and came in 
and made sure that we built an office 
that was led under the same principles 
with which we still lead today: work 
hard, be nice to people, and lead. 
This institution over the last 81⁄2 
years has been made a lot better place 
because Jen Daulby was a part of it. I 
am honored that she was my chief of 
staff for 6 years and has been running 
the House Administration minority 
side for the House for the last 21⁄2 
years. 
There is not a single GOP staffer in 
this institution who does not know her 
name and has not been thankful for the 
information that she has been able to 
put out. She helped take the smallest 
committee in Congress—the House Ad-
ministration Committee—and allowed 
us to lead on so many issues. 
Now, as she moves back into the pri-
vate sector, I have to wish her well. It 
is with a heavy heart I do so, because 
I can tell you there is not a more tena-
cious, there is not a more loyal, and 
there is not a more dedicated person to 
making this House of Representatives 
work for all of us as Members of Con-
gress, for every staff member—like she 
and I used to be—or for every single 
American. 
Jen was here on the floor with us on 
January 6. Jen was the first person I 
saw when I walked into my office after 
I watched my friends get shot on a 
baseball field. Jen was the first person 
I saw on day one as a Member of Con-
gress. She is a leader, she is a patriot, 
and she will always, always have my 
thanks, the thanks of the American 
people, and the thanks of this institu-
tion. But most importantly, her favor-
ite job is being a mom to her young

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CHAD KALEPA BAYBAYAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Hawaiian by Mr. KAHELE is as 
follows:) 
The dark, clouded heavens weep. The 
spirit has embarked on the path with 
no return. 
Ua kani mai ka papa wa‘a 
Ua ue¯ ka lani po¯ panopano 
Ua lele ka ‘uhane i ke ala ho‘i‘ole mai 
Madam Speaker, I stand before you 
today to share with you and the Nation 
the sad news of the passing of a great 
navigator, leader, educator, and friend, 
Chad Kalepa Baybayan. 
On 
March 
8, 
1975, 
the 
deep-sea 
voyaging canoe Hokule‘a was launched. 
Born of legends and stories brought to 
life through the paintings of the ac-
claimed Hawaiian artist Herb Kane, it 
was the first Hawaiian voyaging canoe 
to sail Hawaii’s waters in over 600 
years and became a catalyst for Hawai-
ian pride and identity during the Ha-
waiian renaissance. 
At the age of 19, Kalepa’s first con-
nection to Hokule‘a was on the shores 
of his home island of Maui in 1975 dur-
ing Hokule‘a’s sail trials and crew 
training. This first connection inspired 
him and forever changed his life. He 
has diligently served the voyaging 
movement ever since, learning, grow-
ing, then mastering and teaching the 
next generation of navigators. 
Kalepa also believed deeply in the 
importance of education as a vessel to 
expand the reach of voyaging, and the 
legacy of education his kupuna and 
lahui, his ancestors and nation, left for 
him to continue. 
Kalepa obtained a bachelor’s in Ha-
waiian studies and a master’s in edu-
cation, all while being intimately in-
volved with voyaging and wayfinding. 
He was fluent in ‘olelo Hawaii and had 
a firm belief that indigenous knowl-
edge guiding modern technologies will 
hold the answers to many of the chal-
lenges facing our world today. 
In his professional career, Kalepa 
served as the site director of Honukai, 
the exploration sciences division of the 
‘Aha Punana Leo, where his dedication 
to his language, culture, and love of 
voyaging inspired him to build the first 
Hawaiian language voyaging canoe, 
Hokualaka‘i, that touched hundreds of 
students 
and 
introduced 
them 
to 
voyaging through the perspective of his 
native tongue. 
Kalepa then went on to serve as the 
first-ever navigator in residence at the 
‘Imiloa Astronomy Center at UH Hilo, 
which he helped to establish. His work 
at ‘Imiloa also allowed him to engage 
in the international indigenous edu-
cation movement while also engaging 
in the various sciences, bringing the 
knowledge of his people to the world. 
Kalepa was one of just five Native 
Hawaiian navigators inducted into the 
rank of Pwo by the late Satawalese 
Master Navigator Pius ‘‘Mau’’ Piailug 
in 2007. When asked about the kuleana, 
or responsibilities of being a Pwo mas-
ter navigator, Kalepa would always 
simply state that being Pwo is being a 
light for your community and for your 
people. 
Most recently, Kalepa was key to the 
success of the World Wide Voyage, 
which 
took 
the 
voyaging 
canoe 
Hokule‘a around the world on 31 legs to 
over 150 ports in 18 nations and to these 
very shores of Washington, D.C., in 
May 2016, bringing attention to the 
health of the oceans, its people, and 
the need for a more sustainable world. 
Kalepa crewed 18 of the 31 legs of this 
3-year voyage and, over his career, 
logged more miles voyaging than any 
other crewmember in the nearly five- 
decade 
history 
of 
the 
Polynesian 
voyaging canoe Hokule‘a. 
Kalepa was first and foremost a dedi-
cated and loving husband, son, sibling, 
father, and grandfather who sought 
tirelessly to do his part in creating a 
better world for his ‘ohana, his family, 
and for all children of the world. His 
unwavering commitment to being a 
light to his community and his desire 
to make this world a better place has 
always shone forth. 
I say to my colleagues that Kalepa is 
a prime example of the type of leader 
we should all aspire to be, one who in-
spires others to action while at the 
same time creating opportunities, of-
tentimes when they least expect it, for 
them to fulfill their responsibilities to 
their communities. 
Madam Speaker, on April 8, 2021, 
Kalepa took his final voyage from this 
earthly realm, e ola mau loa ka inoa ‘o 
Chad Kalepa Baybayan. His legacy will 
live on. May we learn from this legacy 
of service as we lead this Nation and 
navigate the waters ahead. Mahalo. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Hawaii will provide a 
translation of his remarks to the 
Clerk.

served as the president of the Clover- 
Lake Wylie Republican Women, the 
largest Republican women’s organiza-
tion in the Fifth District of South 
Carolina. 
Rozalynn held this position for 3 
years, where she made great contribu-
tions to the conservative movement in 
York County. She was also a volunteer 
for the Clover Lake Wylie Preservation 
Park District and played an active role 
in collecting signatures to get their 
referendum on the ballot. 
Prior to moving to South Carolina, 
Rozalynn served as a board member 
and president of the Ocean Springs Re-
publican Women in Mississippi. She 
later joined the Jackson County Re-
publican Party executive committee. 
Rozalynn was the first female Repub-
lican to run for alderman in Ocean 
Springs. Unfortunately, she lost to the 
Democratic 
incumbent 
by 
only 
23 
votes. 
Rozalynn also served on the Ocean 
Springs Chamber of Commerce execu-
tive committee for 4 years, where she 
was chosen as one of the Outstanding 
Young Women of America in 1983. 
She was president of both the Taconi 
Elementary Parent Teachers Organiza-
tion and the Duchess Club children’s 
charity in Mississippi. 
Throughout her career, Rozalynn 
held her own as an international ocean 
sales account executive at CSX Cor-
poration 
and 
Maersk 
Incorporated, 
which were two of the largest shipping 
companies in the world. 
One of Clover’s most hardworking 
and loyal constituents, Rozalynn has 
proven herself an asset to the commu-
nity. Rozalynn’s continued dedication 
to promoting conservative values in 
South Carolina and beyond is a bless-
ing that will never go unnoticed. 
She and her husband, Chip, echoed 
and lived the motto: To live is to serve.

RECOGNIZING HOMER’S MUSIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Small Business 
Month to recognize Homer’s Music, a 
small business and top tourist attrac-
tion in Nebraska’s Second District. 
This year, they celebrate 50 years of 
service to and entrepreneurship in our 
community. During those 50 years, 
Homer’s Music had expanded to nearly 
a dozen locations in Nebraska and 
Iowa, but only the original Omaha lo-
cation remains today. 
Established in 1971, Homer’s Music is 
one of the founding tenants in Omaha’s 
Old Market, which is comprised of cen-
tury-old, four- and five-story brick 
warehouses that were renovated into 
shops, restaurants, and bars. In fact, 
The Old Market is also celebrating its 
50th anniversary this year as well. 
Homer’s Music has been recognized 
as Nebraska’s best music retailer and 
was featured in national publications, 
including The Wall Street Journal and 
The New York Times. While they are 
known for selling vintage records, their 
love for music and its history remains 
timeless. 
It is one thing to own a business, but 
it is another to keep it alive for dec-
ades. Despite the ongoing pandemic 
that has financially impacted many 
local shops and businesses throughout 
America, Homer’s Music has remained 
intact. 
Small businesses are the backbone of 
our economy and society, many of 
which are family or minority-owned. 
Today, and every day, we thank all 
small businesses in our community and 
across Nebraska for their passion, en-
trepreneurship, and advancement to 
our State’s economy and culture. 
Madam Speaker, I close with con-
gratulations to Tom Weidner and fam-
ily and to Mike Fratt and his team for 
accomplishing 50 years in business, and 
here is to 50 more.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
JAMES ROBERT ‘‘BOBBY’’ RYON, 
JR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Bobby Ryon of Hinesville, Geor-
gia, who sadly passed away on March 20 
at the age of 65. 
Bobby lived a remarkable life and 
touched countless lives. He was a life-
long resident of Hinesville, Georgia, 
and was a proud graduate of Bradwell 
Institute’s class of 1974. 
Everyone who knew Bobby remem-
bers his kind and gentle spirit. He was 
a former city of Hinesville council 
member, and served in various capac-
ities in many organizations, including 
Liberty County Hospital Authority, 
Liberty County Chamber of Commerce, 
Diversity Health Clinic, and Hinesville 
Housing Authority. 
Through every position he had, he 
worked to better his community and 
every life he touched. Many say that 
his greatest love was his family, and 
those who knew him best know his 
greatest love also was his Lord. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him, 
during this most difficult time. 
CONGRATULATING BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENT TEACHERS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Brunswick High School student teach-
ers, who recently passed the end of 
pathway assessments for early child-
hood education. These students earned 
the honor of being the high-scoring 
group that has participated in the Pint 
Pirates program—all of this while in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
I commend this group of students for 
their hard work and dedication. The 
Pint Pirates program is an in-school 
preschool program offered at Bruns-
wick High and taught by students from 
Glynn Academy and Brunswick High 
School pursuing the early childhood 
education pathway. The mission of the 
class is to help young children prepare 
for prekindergarten and to better pre-
pare high school students who are in-
terested in teaching early childhood 
programs. 
I am extremely proud to have these 
great students and program here in the 
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia. 
To teachers, students, and staff alike 
at Brunswick High School and Glynn 
Academy: Congratulations on your ac-
complishments, and keep up the good 
work. 
HONORING WALTER RONALD HUGGINS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Ronnie 
Huggins of Garden City and Rincon, 
Georgia, who passed away on March 21, 
2020, at the age of 80. 
Ronnie was born in Savannah, Geor-
gia, and was a graduate of Savannah 
High School. He went on to proudly 
serve our country in the 118th U.S. 
Army Field Artillery Regiment. One of 
Ronnie’s passions in life was helping 
others achieve their dreams. 
He started his own construction busi-
ness and quickly became a distin-
guished and beloved residential home 
builder throughout the Coastal Empire 
and Lowcountry of Hilton Head Island. 
He took great pride in, and had a tal-
ent for, helping others achieve their 
dream home, spending countless hours 
drawing and redrawing house plans by 
hand. 
Ronnie’s passion as a volunteer in 
youth recreation would eventually lead 
to an appointment as the recreation di-
rector for Garden City. 
Ronnie’s wife, Sheila, passed away on 
March 30, 2021. My thoughts and pray-
ers are with their family, friends, and 
all who knew them during this most 
difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING BRUNSWICK, GEORGIA’S 250TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
250th anniversary of the founding of 
Brunswick, Georgia. 
Located on the southeast coast of 
Georgia, Mark Carr was the first Euro-
pean settler to live in what is now the 
city of Brunswick. In 1771, the council 
of the Royal Province of Georgia or-
dered the city of Brunswick to be laid 
out on Carr’s land. The city was plat-
ted by George McIntosh, copying the 
Oglethorpe Plan of Savannah. 
Since its founding, the city of Bruns-
wick has overcome fires, hurricanes, 
wars, and pandemics and has flourished 
as a coastal city. 
Despite such trying times in the past 
year due to the pandemic, businesses 
have continued to emerge and the spir-
it of the people continues to shine. 
It has been 250 years since the mo-
mentous decision to establish Bruns-
wick as a city, and I want to recognize 
the great citizens and public officials 
of Brunswick who have made it and 
continue to make it a tremendous com-
munity and place to live.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BARBARA 
FLAUMENBAUM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in tribute to the life and 
legacy of Mrs. Barbara Flaumenbaum, 
the late mother-in-law of a member of 
our team, Mr. Peter Chong. 
Born in West Oak Lane, Philadelphia, 
Barbara worked tirelessly as a lab 
technician for many years and had a 
spirit that warmed and welcomed all 
lucky enough to cross her path. You 
didn’t have to know her well to see and 
understand how deeply she valued gen-
erosity and compassion. Not a day 
went by when Barbara did not exem-
plify these traits. She instilled these 
qualities and so much more in her fam-
ily and the many lives she touched, in-
cluding her son-in-law, Peter. 
Barbara and her husband of over 45 
years, Steven, raised two incredible 
daughters, Alisha and Lindsay. Family 
was everything to Barbara, and what 
Barbara loved most about life was 
being a mother and, most recently, a 
grandmother to her two grandsons, 
Ethan and Benjamin. 
They say the best measure of a life 
well-lived has less to do with the num-
ber of our accomplishments, but more 
to do the with the number of lives we 
have touched. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear that Bar-
bara’s was a life well-lived and one that 
will be greatly missed by all.

RECOGNIZING COUNCIL ROCK SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the tremen-
dous work and ingenuity of a group of 
students at Council Rock South High 
School in Pennsylvania’s First Con-
gressional District. 
At the height of the pandemic, Dan-
iel 
Krauss, 
Noah 
Necowitz, 
Dean 
DiDomenico, 
and 
Dylan 
Weselovs, 
along with the guidance of their teach-
er, Fred Bauer, saw a need in our com-
munity and heeded the call to help. 
This innovative, impressive group of 
young men worked tirelessly to design, 
manufacture, and deliver 3,000 life-
saving PPE face shields that were cer-
tified by the Bucks County Emergency 
Operations Center to medical facilities, 
nursing homes, and our frontline he-
roes in Bucks County. 
I want to applaud this very special 
group of students for taking what they 
learned in the classroom and using 
that to serve our community. I know 
the future of both our community and 
country is bright with young men like 
Daniel, Noah, Dean, and Dylan at the 
helm. I stand here today on the floor to 
express our community’s utmost pride 
and gratitude for them. We are excited 
to see all that they will accomplish and 
know that, wherever their paths may 
lead, their futures will be very bright.

REMAINING FOCUSED ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
recently met with local and State lead-
ers about the infrastructure needs of 
our community, which are significant. 
There is widespread agreement that an 
investment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture is needed to alleviate traffic, im-
prove flooding conditions, and address 
other safety concerns. 
Imagine my disappointment, Madam 
Speaker, to learn that less than 10 per-
cent of President Biden’s $2 trillion in-
frastructure package will be spent on 
roads and bridges. Also of concern, less 
than 2 percent of the package is allo-
cated for waterways, locks, dams, 
ports, and airports, which are all very 
important to the State of Florida; and 
less than 50 percent is allocated for 
much-needed 
broadband 
expansion, 
which would help to address the digital 
divide in our country. 
These 
traditional 
infrastructure 
projects, coupled with infrastructure 
investments that are linked to our Na-
tion’s security, such as safeguarding 
our energy grid, water systems, and 
other critical assets from cyber and 
other attacks, are the types of projects 
my constituents want to see funded. 
Unfortunately, President Biden is 
using the guise of infrastructure spend-
ing, which enjoys relatively high sup-
port among Americans—it is really a 
bipartisan issue—to push highly par-
tisan and unpopular policy proposals, 
such as the Green New Deal. Many of 
these policies will hurt American con-
sumers and workers. 
The vast majority of spending in the 
bill consists of non-infrastructure ex-
penditures. For example, the bill con-
tains $400 billion in expansion of Med-
icaid; $213 billion in spending for hous-
ing initiatives; $100 billion of addi-
tional funding for schools, without any 
type of requirement for them to re-
open; $50 billion for a new office at the 
U.S. Department of Commerce; $35 bil-
lion for climate science; and $10 billion 
for a new ‘‘Civilian Climate Corps.’’ 
Adding insult to injury, Madam 
Speaker, this astronomical spending 
plan would be funded through tax in-
creases. This current proposal fails to 
address our Nation’s most critical in-
frastructure needs and falls short of 
meeting my constituents’ expectations. 
We can do better, Madam Speaker, if 
we work together. My constituents 
want their elected officials to work to-
gether to get things done, improving 
opportunities for our families and our 
community. They do not want to see us 
use our time in Washington to play po-
litical games. Please be assured I will 
remain focused on this paramount ob-
jective.

SUPPORTING RIGHT-TO-WORK 
LAWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS. Madam Speaker, ear-
lier this month, employees at Ama-
zon’s Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment 
facility rejected unionization by a 
1,798–738 vote. That is a monumental 70 
percent against unions to a meager 30 
percent for unions. 
Bam. That kind of vote sends a pow-
erful anti-union, pro-liberty message to 
America and the world. 
I applaud Amazon’s Bessemer em-
ployees for rejecting unionization at-
tempts by out-of-state agitators, from 
the President to Hollywood actors and 
on down. A primary reason why Ama-
zon chose to locate nearly 6,000 good- 
paying jobs in Alabama is Alabama’s 
nonunion reputation. 
Alabama maintains that reputation 
after Bessemer’s overwhelming anti- 
union vote, thus ensuring even more 
companies will relocate even more 
good-paying jobs from union States up 
north into Alabama. 
Alabama is a right-to-work State. 
What does ‘‘right to work’’ mean? 
Right-to-work laws protect citizens 
from being forced against their will to 
join a union, pay union dues, and sub-
ject themselves to union bosses. 
Alabama’s right-to-work status gives 
Alabama a strong economic advantage 
over forced union States. For example, 
69 percent of jobs reshored from over-
seas back into America between 2010 
and 2019 have gone to right-to-work 
States. U.S. Commerce Department 
data, adjusted for cost-of-living dif-
ferences, revealed that 2019’s manufac-
turing job pay in right-to-work States 
averaged $83,000 per employee, $4,000 
more than in forced union States. That 
is a big difference in pay. 
According to Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics data, right-to-work States’ overall 
job growth was a robust 11 percent over 
the past decade versus a meager 2.4 
percent in forced union States. When 
that data is limited to manufacturing 
jobs only, right-to-work States, over 
the past decade, enjoyed a very good 9.1 
percent increase in manufacturing jobs 
while forced union States had a hor-
rible two-tenths of 1 percent cut in 
manufacturing jobs. 
Better yet, 2018 Census data reveals 
that after-tax mean income per house-
hold, after cost-of-living adjustment, 
was $64,572 in right-to-work States 
versus $60,244 in forced union States. 
That is, on average, $4,328 more real, 
adjusted for cost of living, income per 
capita in right-to-work versus union 
States. That is a huge difference. 
So, Madam Speaker, the economic 
data clearly proves that right-to-work 
laws benefit workers. Consistent with 
that economic prosperity and desire for

freedom and liberty—after all, no one 
likes being told what they can and can-
not do—74 percent of Americas say 
they support right-to-work laws, ac-
cording to a recent Gallup Poll. 
Despite overwhelming American sup-
port for right-to-work laws, dictatorial 
Socialists in March rammed through 
the House a bill that repeals all right- 
to-work laws in America. Worse yet, 
dictatorial Socialists seek to use Presi-
dent Biden’s infrastructure bill to slip 
in a provision that repeals all right-to- 
work laws in America. 
I hope neither of these terrible dic-
tatorial bills ever reaches President 
Biden’s desk. Certainly, I will vote 
against them and I will vote for free-
dom, liberty, and protection of Amer-
ica’s right-to-work laws. 
Madam Speaker, America would be 
stronger if more States would enact 
right-to-work laws. I encourage citi-
zens and elected officials to promote 
right-to-work laws, freedom of choice, 
and the freedom and liberty right-to- 
work laws represent.

IMPORTANCE OF BIPARTISAN EN-
GAGEMENT 
ON 
INFRASTRUC-
TURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
TORRES of California). The Chair recog-
nizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
GIMENEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address the House on the 
importance of bipartisan engagement 
on infrastructure. 
Yesterday afternoon, I had the privi-
lege of sitting in the Oval Office with 
President Biden as we, along with a 
small group of Senators and Represent-
atives, discussed the best way possible 
to move forward on infrastructure. 
Our commitment is clear: Repub-
licans agree that we should put more 
resources and key investments into the 
things that we consider the traditional 
definition of infrastructure. This in-
cludes our roads and highways, bridges, 
ports, and waterways. In order to main-
tain our competitiveness in the world, 
strategic investments in things like 
public transportation and improved air 
and rail mobility are also key. 
We also need to continue fostering 
American entrepreneurship and private 
investment in the area of automotive 
technology with numerous auto compa-
nies making great gains in automotive 
vehicles running on clean, safe, sus-
tainable energy sources, as well as cre-
ating an economic environment where 
they can continue to build out their 
own electric charging station net-
works. 
Republicans also understand the im-
portance of the technology side of in-
frastructure, such as the need to ex-
pand rural broadband, fortify our cy-
bersecurity to protect critical assets 
from foreign adversaries, and improv-
ing our telecommunication networks 
across the country. These are all key 
areas where Republicans and Demo-
crats can come together and work on 
infrastructure solutions in a broad, bi-
partisan way. 
As it was made clear to the Presi-
dent, unfortunately, the current pro-
posal floating around goes well beyond 
that scope and includes funding for 
projects that are not infrastructure. As 
much as some of our Members on the 
other side of the aisle want to speak it 
into truth, the expansion of social wel-
fare programs is not infrastructure. 
If my colleagues want to engage in a 
rigorous debate over the merits of ex-
panding Medicaid and providing elder 
care, or whatever else they want to put 
into this infrastructure proposal, they 
ought to bring separate bills onto the 
floor. I am sure my colleagues on this 
side of the aisle will be happy to en-
gage in that debate. 
What we cannot allow is for these 
provisions to be snuck into a big spend-
ing package under the guise of infra-
structure. 
I do have a small glimmer of hope 
that there is a bipartisan avenue for 
moving an infrastructure package. In 
order to get it done, it is going to take 
compromise between both sides. Presi-
dent Biden and my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle must engage in 
earnest negotiations with Republicans.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God our judge, as we anxiously await 
the verdict from the jury in Minnesota, 
we plead our case with You. As a coun-
try, we are rent with acrimony, torn by 
our individual understandings of right 
and wrong, facts and feelings, and di-
vided by a host of opinions on crime 
and punishment. 
Call us to lay all of this—as hopeless 
as it appears—on Your judgment seat. 
Then lay Your divine hand upon the 
outcome of this case, and also on our 
compatriots’ anger, their thoughts of 
revenge, and the insatiable need to dis-
rupt and destroy. Stay any inclinations 
toward violence and remind us that 
vengeful behavior is no more justified 
than the acts of those who precipitated 
that grief and harm and ignited our 
cities. 
Be merciful on this Nation—despite 
how we have turned our backs on Your 
perfect love. As You inevitably judge 
our response to the incidents of unrest 
that plague our land, forgive our iniq-
uities and heal our brokenness. Redeem 
the soul of our country. 
Then inspire these leaders of our gov-
ernment to find ways to represent back 
to their districts and to our commu-
nities a better way toward reconciling 
the divide. Call them to follow Your ex-
ample of compassion and care, humil-
ity and love. 
In Your saving name we pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

THE NORTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, it has been 395 days since the 
United States-Canadian border closed, 
and the closure was just extended an-
other 30 days. 
Families on both sides of the border 
have been torn apart. People who love 
each other, parents, and grandchildren 
are unable to see each other. Vac-
cinated citizens of both countries sig-
nificantly lower the risk of getting 
COVID and wearing face masks signifi-
cantly lowers the risk of giving COVID. 
We need a plan to open the U.S.-Ca-
nadian 
border 
with 
vaccines, 
face 
masks, and good physical distancing. 
We can do so safely and successfully.

jobs and economic growth. Manufactur-
ers, small businesses, trade unions, and 
industry groups are concerned about 
the increasing skilled labor shortage. 
Unfortunately, current law limits the 
use of eligible savings accounts to help 
reduce the costs of obtaining advanced 
technical certifications. 
My legislation, the American Work-
force Empowerment Act, would allow 
529 savings accounts to be used for non- 
degree technical training certificate 
programs, tools, and any tests that are 
required to maintain certifications. 
As the American workforce rebounds, 
we will see increased need for skilled 
workers to meet rising manufacturing, 
shipping, and construction demand. 
These skilled labor positions are good- 
paying jobs that help provide economic 
stability for hardworking Americans 
and are essential to the expansion of 
our Nation’s economy. 
f 
CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN 
JONATHAN TURNBULL 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Captain Jona-
than Turnbull on his promotion to 
major in the United States Army. 
Captain Turnbull of Gaylord, Michi-
gan, was deployed in Syria where he 
worked with local forces and non-
governmental organizations to sta-
bilize the area and provide humani-
tarian assistance. 
On January 16, 2019, an ISIS suicide 
bomber forever changed the course of 
his life and the life of his brothers. 
Four Americans were killed on that 
day, and Jonathan received life-threat-
ening injuries. His courage and bravery 
on that day and each day since has in-
spired countless Americans as he re-
covered and continued his service. 
Jonathan is the epitome of an Amer-
ican patriot and embodies the fighting 
spirit of our Nation’s Armed Forces. He 
has fought for his life and his country 
and has truly earned this promotion to 
major. 
I speak for the entire First District 
when I say how proud we are of Jona-
than, his service, and his commitment. 
I wish him, Samantha, Ian, and baby 
Scotty all the best in the many years 
to come. 
f 
MOUNT NOTRE DAME GIRLS 
BASKETBALL 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Mount Notre 
Dame High School girls basketball 
team on winning the Ohio High School 
Athletic Association championship. 
Mount Notre Dame captured the Di-
vision 1 State championship title after 
beating Newark in a 2-point double 
overtime thriller. This championship 
was the eighth championship for the 
Mount Notre Dame basketball pro-
gram—the most in Ohio school history. 
Coach Scott Rogers led his team to a 
28–0 record, a number two national 
ranking, and has won 72 consecutive 
games. 
Among the team’s many talented 
athletes is junior guard KK Bransford 
who was recently named Ohio’s Ms. 
Basketball. 
I commend Coach Scott Rogers and 
the entire Mount Notre Dame girls bas-
ketball team for this historic accom-
plishment and tradition of excellence. 
Congratulations, again, to the Mount 
Notre Dame players, to Coach Rogers 
and his staff, and to the Mount Notre 
Dame faithful. 
f 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, since mid- 
January we have seen a surge of immi-
grants coming into the country along 
our southwest border. The numbers are 
staggering, and the situation along the 
border continues to deteriorate daily. 
In March, over 172,000 individuals were 
encountered by law enforcement, the 
highest number of monthly encounters 
in the last 15 years. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
visit the border and met with both Fed-
eral and State law enforcement offi-
cers. We heard repeatedly that recent 
changes by the Biden administration 
have driven the overwhelming surge. 
Lost in the border conversation is 
the incredible amount of resources 
being diverted to try and manage the 
immigrants we are encountering. This 
shift in resources is being exploited by 
drug cartels who continue to use the 
southwest border as the primary pipe-
line to bring cocaine, methamphet-
amine, and fentanyl into the country. 
The question can no longer be: Is 
there a crisis along the border? 
But instead it should be: How long 
will the crisis last, and how bad must 
the crisis become before the President 
will act? 
f 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address what I think is 
the biggest crisis to our sovereignty 
since I have been here, and that is what 
is going on at the border. 
It is hard to think of something new 
to say, but I want to point out as we 
pursue an open borders policy that it 
greatly increases the power of the 
Mexican cartels. 
Because the Mexican cartels have a 
monopoly on letting people in this 
country, I heard a story of two people 
who weren’t part of the cartels trying 
to sneak people across. Two of them 
were skinned alive, and a third one was 
partially skinned and sent back to say: 
This is what happens if you try to push 
people across without going through 
the cartels. 
I want to point out an anecdote of a 
father and a, perhaps, 7-year-old girl 
who were murdered for trying to come 
across without the approval of the car-
tels. 
I would like to address the 70,000 peo-
ple who died from illegal drugs this 
year. I was recently at the Milwaukee 
DEA, and I was told last year 540 peo-
ple in Milwaukee County died of illegal 
drug use, and the local agents sus-
pected that all 540 were killed by drugs 
or ingredients from drugs that came 
across the Mexican border. 
Please, President Biden, do some-
thing about the crisis on the border. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

LOCAL GRAMMY WINNER JAMES 
BLACHLY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late Johnstown, Pennsylvania, local, 
James Blachly, on his 2021 Grammy 
win. 
In April 2018, Blachly and the Johns-
town Symphony Orchestra performed 
the U.S. world premiere of Dame Ethel 
Smyth’s ‘‘The Prison.’’ It was this per-
formance that won the 2021 Grammy. 
Serving as the music director of the 
Johnstown Symphony Orchestra and as 
music director of the Experiential Or-
chestra, Mr. Blachly is known for his 
innovative programming which aims to 
increase audience engagement. 
James is an incredibly talented con-
ductor and composer. In 2016, he was 
the only conductor from the United 
States invited to participate in the 
first annual Young Conductors Show-
case as part of El Sistema’s 40th anni-
versary celebration, and he was the 
only U.S. conductor to be invited as 
Conducting Fellow in Maestra Marin 
Alsop’s final year at the Cabrillo Fes-
tival of Contemporary Music. 
Congratulations to James and the 
Johnstown Symphony. Their hard work 
and dedication have truly paid off.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1967 
April 20, 2021 
SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2523, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2523, as amended, the Training in 
High-Demand Roles to Improve Vet-
eran Employment Act, or THRIVE Act. 
H.R. 2523, as amended, builds off the 
work of the American Rescue Plan to 
deliver employment training quicker 
and more effectively to veterans who 
have lost their jobs due to COVID–19. 
The American Rescue Plan was one 
of the most important pieces of legisla-
tion many of us will ever have the 
chance to vote on, making genera-
tional 
investments 
into 
veteran 
healthcare, 
homelessness, 
and 
job 
training programs. 
Following the passage of that legisla-
tion into law, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs highlighted some im-
provements to the law to deliver job 
training benefits quicker and more eq-
uitably to all Americans, regardless of 
where they live. 
The legislation before us will get 
those benefits out quicker to veterans 
and will improve the recordkeeping of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
and the Department of Labor to ensure 
veterans are aware of options available 
to them to find quality employment. 
The THRIVE Act will also see the VA 
partner with local business groups to 
facilitate job placement. 
Madam Speaker, in addition, the De-
partment shared with our committee 
ways to improve the Johnny Isakson 
and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans 
Health Care and Benefits Improvement 
Act of 2020, to improve the experience 
for student veterans who are still being 
impacted by classroom experiences due 
to COVID–19. 
This is why this legislation, offered 
by 
Economic 
Opportunity 
Sub-
committee Chairman MIKE LEVIN and 
Ranking Member MIKE
BOST, is so 
timely and important. 
This legislation is endorsed by many 
VSOs, including the Student Veterans 
of America, the National Association 
of State Approving Agencies, Paralyzed 
Veterans of America, and Disabled 
American Veterans. 
I wish to thank Speaker PELOSI and 
Leader HOYER for bringing H.R. 2523, as 
amended, to the floor so quickly. I urge 
the rest of my colleagues to support 
this legislation to ensure VA can de-
liver assistance to our veterans as 
quickly as possible. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2523, as amended, the 
Training in High-Demand Roles to Im-
prove Veteran Employment Act, or 
THRIVE Act. 
This legislation would make needed 
improvements to the American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021. It would also make 
several technical corrections to the 
Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. 
Veterans Health Care and Improve-
ment Act of 2020. 
COVID–19 has had a profound impact 
on our economy. It has closed small 
businesses across the country and left 
millions of Americans unemployed. 
That includes an estimated half a mil-
lion veterans. Before the pandemic, the 
veterans unemployment rate was at a 
near record low. Today, it is almost 
double that. 
We must help our veterans get back 
to work. I introduced the Veterans 
Economic Recovery Act earlier this 
year to do just that. That bill created 
the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assist-
ance Program, or V-RAP. V-RAP al-
lows veterans who are unemployed be-
cause of COVID–19 to receive rapid re-
training to compete for high-demand 
jobs. 
The bulk of the Veterans Economic 
Recovery Act was enacted as part of 
the American Rescue Plan. Unfortu-
nately, because Speaker PELOSI used 
the reconciliation process to pass the 
ARP, there were several provisions of 
V-RAP that were not included. That is 
why I was pleased to work with Chair-
man LEVIN on the bill before us today. 
It would finish the job and ensure that 
V-RAP is set up for success. 
Specifically, the THRIVE Act would 
allow the VA to add jobs to the in-de-
mand occupations list so the training 
leads to meaningful employment; re-
quire the VA to work with the Depart-
ment of Labor and nonprofit organiza-
tions to ensure that V-RAP partici-
pants are provided employment serv-
ices once their training is over; require 
the GAO to report on the overall effec-
tiveness of V-RAP; and make changes 
to how the VA pays schools for train-
ing that participants receive so that it 
can be used by the veterans very quick-
ly. 
While I am glad the changes are 
being made, it is unfortunate they were 
not initially addressed in the ARP. 
The THRIVE Act also includes the 
text of the bill by Representative 
TORRES of California. Her bill would 
add information to the GI Bill com-
parison tool to let the veterans know if 
schools have a religious affiliation or 
have historically served a particular 
minority population. This will help 
veterans be better informed when they 
decide to use their GI Bill benefits. 
I thank Representative TORRES for 
her work, and I am glad that we were 
able to include her legislation in this 
bill. 
I am grateful to Chairman TAKANO 
and Congressman LEVIN for working 
with me on the THRIVE Act. I am con-
fident that it will help veterans get 
back on their feet. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LEVIN), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Economic Oppor-
tunity, the author of the bill, and also 
my good friend and fellow Californian. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank our great chairman, 
Chairman TAKANO, and our ranking 
member for their great work. It is an 
honor to continue serving our veterans 
in a bipartisan manner and to chair the 
relevant subcommittee. 
As the Representative for Marine 
Corps Base Camp Pendleton and thou-
sands of military families in the re-
gion, I am incredibly proud of the work 
we have accomplished in the past few 
years for our Nation’s veterans. 
Back in January of this year, the 
Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. 
Veterans Health Care and Benefits Im-
provement Act was signed into law. It 
was a historic omnibus bill for veterans 
that strengthened many benefits and 
services for those who have served our 
country. It was a great bipartisan ac-
complishment. Again, I am grateful to 
all of my colleagues for getting it 
across the finish line. 
It included provisions to improve 
services for homeless veterans, to pro-
tect GI Bill benefits, improve the Tran-
sition Assistance Program for service-
members returning to civilian life, and 
so much more. It was the product, 
again, of bipartisan, bicameral work, 
proof that we can do things on a bipar-
tisan basis here in Washington, D.C., 
and I was proud to help lead that bill. 
Most recently, we passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, a landmark piece of 
legislation 
to 
help 
Americans 
get 
through this pandemic, including our 
veterans who have struggled to get 
back on their feet during this difficult 
time. 
A key piece of that bill was nearly 
$400 million for a rapid retraining pro-
gram for veterans who are unemployed 
as a result of this pandemic and don’t 
have access to other veteran education 
benefits. 
Both of these bills were huge accom-
plishments; but, like all legislation, 
they weren’t perfect, and there are still 
steps that we must take to make these 
programs work even better for the vet-
erans they are intended to serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1968 
April 20, 2021 
That is why I was proud to introduce 
legislation with Ranking Member MIKE 
BOST of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, amending the American 
Rescue Plan and the Isakson-Roe legis-
lation to improve job training and edu-
cation programs for our veterans. 
For example, our bill makes changes 
to the Rapid Retraining Assistance 
Program so we are focusing on high-de-
mand occupations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 11⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, it will also improve the VA’s 
communication with veterans about 
employment placement services. It will 
clarify veterans’ eligibility for housing 
stipends under the retraining program. 
And it will ensure the VA works with 
qualified nonprofit business associa-
tions to facilitate the employment of 
participating veterans. 
Nothing in this bill is controversial. 
It is all about improving existing vet-
erans’ programs so they can get back 
to work and make the most of the serv-
ices they have earned and deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can pass 
this bill without delay, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers at this time, 
I am prepared to close, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
America’s veterans are facing an unem-
ployment crisis that threatens their 
livelihoods. While this current govern-
ment focuses on giving jobs to illegal 
immigrants, approximately half a mil-
lion veterans are out of work as of 
March 2021. 
Americans often talk about their 
love of our troops. As politicians, we 
often take victory laps through our 
districts meeting veterans and pledging 
to work for them. Now it is time for us 
to act on that pledge. The THRIVE Act 
represents a commonsense step to em-
power both veterans and educational 
institutions who provide much-needed 
workforce training. 
I come from a family of veterans. For 
six generations, the men of my family 
have served their country proudly in 
the Armed Forces. I represent the first 
generation to enter a different type of 
service. While I cannot say I have expe-
rienced the trauma and sacrifice that 
our men and women have experienced 
on the battlefield, I have witnessed the 
brutally difficult task of transitioning 
back to the home front. If we, as elect-
ed Representatives, can ease that proc-
ess and reduce veteran unemployment 
in one fell swoop, then I firmly believe 
that we are obligated to do so. 
The THRIVE Act would ensure that 
the additional authorities and funding 
Congress provided for unemployed vet-
erans work as intended to help vet-
erans in need to find good, well-paying 
jobs. Let’s enable our veterans to tran-
sition back into civilian life. Those 
who have given so much to this Nation 
deserve nothing less. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
b 1430 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank all the Members who were in-
volved in moving forward with this leg-
islation, especially Chairman TAKANO, 
and I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the bipartisan way in which 
we moved forward on this bill. I want 
to thank all my colleagues, and I urge 
all of them to join me in passing H.R. 
2523, as amended. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2523, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform and 
provides for one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1333, the NO BAN Act, 
and H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel 
Act of 2021, both under closed rules. 
The rule provides an hour of debate on 
each bill equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary and provides one motion to re-
commit on each bill. 
The rule deems as passed H.R. 316, 
providing for the expenses of certain 
committees, and H. Con. Res. 30, pro-
viding for a joint session of Congress to 
receive a message from the President 
of the United States. The rule also re-
stricts former Members’ access to the 
House floor during the joint session. 
Additionally, the rule provides au-
thority through April 22 for the major-
ity leader or his designee to move to en 
bloc postponed votes on any suspension 
bill considered on April 19 or 20 on 
which the yeas and nays were ordered. 
Finally, the rule provides for recess 
instructions, same day, and suspension 
authority through May 20. 
Madam Speaker, Tocqueville wrote 
in ‘‘Democracy in America’’ that in our 
country voting rights and democracy 
are always either contracting and re-
treating and shriveling away or voting 
rights and democracy are growing and 
expanding. 
What a proud day for the United 
States Congress when we get to keep 
the trajectory of American democracy 
moving forward by voting to admit a 
new State to our beloved Union. 
America 
began 
with 
13 
original 
States, and we in Congress have exer-
cised our powers under Article IV, Sec-
tion 3 37 different times to admit 37 
new States to the Union, which means 
that nearly 75 percent of the States in 
America today were admitted after the 
original 13. 
Today, we can keep the dynamics of 
democratic political growth and inclu-
sion going in America by beginning the 
process 
of 
admitting 
Washington, 
Douglass Commonwealth to the Union 
by passing H.R. 51. 
We have the opportunity to do some-
thing that hasn’t happened here since 
1959, when Alaska and Hawaii were ad-
mitted to the Union in January and in 
August of that year. 
We can vote to admit a new State to 
the Union, and what a State it will be: 
A 
community 
of 
712,000 
taxable, 
draftable, law-abiding American citi-
zens who actually pay more Federal 
taxes per capita now than do the people 
of any State, more in hard dollars than 
the people of 22 States combined. It is 
a community of people who have 
fought in every war that the Union has 
ever fought, going all the way back to 
the American Revolution. 
And it was a community, signifi-
cantly, that came to the aid of democ-
racy, that came to the aid of the 
Union, that came to the aid of this 
Congress when we called on January 6, 
2021. 
More than 850 officers in the Metro-
politan Police Department came and 
fought shoulder to shoulder with our 
Capitol officers in what has been de-
scribed as waves of medieval violence 
by insurrectionists and Fascists at-
tacking them with bats and sticks and 
American flagpoles and Confederate 
flagpoles and Trump flagpoles. They 
sent more than 150 National Guards-
men from Washington, D.C., 154 D.C. 
National Guard, 850 Metropolitan Po-
lice Department to come and defend a 
democracy that they are not yet a part 
of. 
Now think about that. We had people 
who came and stormed the Capitol, laid 
siege to the Congress of the United 
States with fictionalized claims about 
a denial of their right to vote, and 
right in this city there are 712,000 
American citizens who we know have 
their voting rights denied every single 
day, their rights to representation de-
nied every single day, and they came to 
defend us against those who would 
have torn down the very citadel of de-
mocracy. 
Think about that when we are decid-
ing how to vote on H.R. 51. 
b 1445 
The current status of the people in 
Washington, D.C., subjects them to two 
different forms of political domination 
and exclusion. 
On the one hand, all of their locally 
adopted laws ultimately can be over-
turned by a Congress which they are 
excluded from, and it has happened 
many times throughout the history of 
the District of Columbia, as Congress-
woman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, the 
nonvoting Delegate, will tell you. Con-
gress has tampered with the laws of 
adoption, laws of marriage, criminal 
justice laws, and voting laws in the 
District of Columbia. 
But it is not just that. It is not just 
that the rights of democratic self-gov-
ernment are subject to the will of other 
people. It is also that this community 
of taxpaying, draftable American citi-
zens is excluded from participating in 
Federal legislation because they don’t 
have voting representatives in the 
House and in the Senate. 
That means on matters relating to 
war and peace, the confirmation of U.S. 
Supreme Court Justices and other Fed-
eral judges, the development of Federal 
budgets, the regulation of commerce 
domestically and internationally, Fed-
eral criminal law, and Federal civil 
law, the people of Washington, D.C., 
are dealt out. They are excluded. And 
they want in. They want to enter the 
Union. 
Most of us in Congress represent 
communities that were not part of the 
original 13 but then came in later. 
Now, I come from Maryland, which was 
one of the original 13, but most of the 
people in Congress represent States 
that came in later. 
So, this is an act of fundamental 
democratic and civic self-respect on 
their part to be asking for equality and 
inclusion, and it is a matter of basic 
constitutional patriotism and demo-
cratic respect that we vote to admit 
them today. 
I am very happy that we are kicking 
this process off by bringing this rule to 
the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from Maryland for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today provides for consideration of 
three pieces of legislation. 
The first bill, H.R. 1333, limits the 
President’s existing authority to re-
strict entry of foreigners into the 
United States. 
Border Patrol is encountering more 
than 5,500 individuals per day at our 
southern border. Let me say that 
again. They are encountering 5,500 in-
dividuals per day at the southern bor-
der. 
Over the weekend, President Biden fi-
nally acknowledged the situation for 
what it is—not a challenge but a crisis. 
Yet, House Democrats are moving for-
ward with a bill that does nothing to 
stop the surge of migrants at the 
southern border and, instead, actually 
weakens our national security. 
Along the same lines, House Resolu-
tion 330 provides for consideration of 
H.R. 1573, which requires access to 
counsel for all travelers referred to a 
secondary inspection at airports and 
other ports of entry. 
Again, this bill does nothing to ad-
dress the Biden border crisis. It would

actually complicate the job of Border 
Patrol agents while costing taxpayers 
$825 million over the next 5 years. 
With 
a 
233 
percent 
increase 
in 
fentanyl seizures at our southern bor-
der, it is a shame that my liberal col-
leagues across the aisle are actually 
creating more work for Border Patrol. 
Instead, we should provide these brave 
men and women with much-needed re-
sources to address the national secu-
rity and public health consequences of 
the Biden border crisis. 
Lastly, this resolution makes in 
order H.R. 51, legislation admitting the 
present District of Columbia as the 51st 
State and authorizing special elections 
for two Senators and one Representa-
tive. 
This is nothing more than an uncon-
stitutional power grab by Democrats to 
gain two ultraprogressive D.C. Senate 
seats and force radical, far-left policies 
on the American people. 
Our Founding Fathers never intended 
for D.C. to become a State. In Fed-
eralist No. 43, James Madison argued 
that if the Capital City were situated 
within a State, the Federal Govern-
ment would be subject to undue influ-
ence by the host State. As such, Arti-
cle I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. 
Constitution establishes a neutral dis-
trict for our Nation’s representatives 
to meet and vote on equal ground. 
Further, the 23rd Amendment grants 
three Presidential electors specifically 
for the District. The original meaning 
of the ‘‘district’’ in the Constitution, 
and the necessary repeal of the 23rd 
Amendment, requires an amendment to 
the Constitution in order for D.C. to 
even become a State. 
Just don’t take my word for it, 
though. Since 1963, every Justice De-
partment, Republican and Democrat, 
that has addressed the issue of D.C. 
statehood has concluded that Congress 
does not have the authority to alter 
the status of the city legislatively. 
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy 
thought it was inconceivable that D.C. 
would be granted statehood without re-
pealing the 23rd Amendment and that 
the result would ‘‘produce an absurd-
ity.’’ Again, those are the words of 
RFK. 
Finally, the legislation before us 
today does nothing to address the fi-
nancial implications of D.C. statehood. 
According to a 2020 study, D.C. ranked 
150th out of 150 of the largest cities for 
its lack of operating efficiency—150 out 
of 150. 
The Federal Government provides 
billions of dollars to D.C. each year for 
everything from the judicial system to 
the pension system. Yet, House Demo-
crats are so desperate to jam this 
measure through that, under H.R. 51, 
the Federal Government will remain 
responsible for funding many of the 
new State’s functions. 
There is absolutely no incentive for 
the new State to work toward financial 
self-sufficiency, meaning Americans in 
other States would be forced to fund 
D.C. Democrats’ priorities. 
Again, House Democrats are pushing 
ahead to admit a new State to the 
Union purely for partisan gain while 
ignoring the constitutional, practical, 
and legal challenges in doing so. That 
is why I urge my colleagues to oppose 
this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me address a couple of the spe-
cious constitutional objections that 
have been raised by our colleagues on 
the other side. 
To begin with, it would be unconsti-
tutional to turn the District of Colum-
bia into a State. It would almost cer-
tainly be that, but that is not what the 
proposal is. The proposal is to redraw 
the boundaries of the District of Co-
lumbia to cede the residential lands to 
the new State to admit it. For that, 
there is both sound constitutional and 
historical precedent. 
For one thing, Article I, Section 8, 
Clause 17 says that Congress shall ‘‘ex-
ercise exclusive legislation in all cases 
whatsoever’’ over the district that is to 
become the seat of government, mean-
ing that Congress has the authority to 
modify the boundaries of the District 
of Columbia, which it has done. 
It did that, actually, in 1791. Not long 
after the original boundaries were set, 
James Madison and 13 other Founders 
themselves voted to alter the bound-
aries. But our colleagues seem to be-
lieve that the boundaries of the Dis-
trict can’t be altered by Congress. 
In 1846, most significantly, Congress 
gave one-third of the District of Co-
lumbia to the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia at the behest of slave masters, 
who correctly anticipated that the 
slave traffic would be abolished within 
the District of Columbia. It was given 
back, demonstrating that the author-
ity of Congress to change the bound-
aries of the District exists. 
If Congress can alter the boundaries 
of the District of Columbia in 1846 in 
order to serve the slave masters and to 
protect their institution, surely the 
Congress in 2021 can modify the bound-
aries of the District of Columbia in 
order to admit a new State and em-
power hundreds of thousands of people 
to live in political equality in the 
country. 
My 
distinguished 
colleague 
from 
Pennsylvania invites us to believe that 
the 23rd Amendment is a constitu-
tional impediment to adopting state-
hood for Washington, D.C. He doesn’t 
explain why it is unconstitutional. He 
just asserts it would be unconstitu-
tional. 
The 23rd Amendment was adopted in 
order to give people living within the 
seat of government the possibility of 
voting for President and to have elec-
toral college votes in a manner decided 
by Congress and then, in Section 2, re-
quiring Congress to act in order to or-
ganize the electoral college in the man-
ner of a State legislature organizing 
the electoral college for the State. 
As I understand H.R. 51, introduced 
by Congresswoman NORTON, this prob-
lem is taken care of at the moment of 
statehood admission because it repeals 
the statute which organizes the elec-
toral college for the District of Colum-
bia. 
In other words, the moment the new 
State comes into being, the current 
statute that organizes the Presidential 
electors is repealed, so there is nothing 
to worry about. I agree that there is a 
certain kind of messiness in still hav-
ing the 23rd Amendment on the books, 
but Congresswoman NORTON has said 
she will be the first to introduce a for-
mal constitutional amendment to re-
peal the 23rd, and who would oppose it? 
Our colleagues have not been able to 
find a single person who would oppose 
it. Everybody would agree it would be 
simply nonsensical to keep it within 
the Constitution once the 712,000 people 
have negotiated an exodus from the 
Federal seat of government in order to 
become their own State. 
So, I think that that is a red herring. 
It is an irrelevant distraction to this 
journey toward statehood and political 
equality that we are on. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend for yielding and 
for his support of H.R. 51. 
The rule before us is not ordinary. It 
is the prelude to history, and I use that 
word advisedly. Last Congress, the 
House passed the D.C. statehood bill, 
the first time either Chamber of Con-
gress had passed the bill. This Congress 
with Democrats controlling the House, 
Senate, and White House, D.C. state-
hood is within reach for the first time 
in history. 
As a result of education from House 
proceedings like today’s, 54 percent of 
the American people support D.C. 
statehood according to a wide-ranging 
poll that has just been released, and we 
predict that with increasing exposure, 
that percentage will continue to rise. 
For the 220 years since D.C. became 
our capital, District residents, who 
have had all of the obligations of citi-
zenship, including paying full Federal 
taxes and serving in the Armed Forces, 
have been excluded from much of 
American democracy. The citizens who 
live in our Nation’s Capital have never 
had voting representation on the floor 
of either Chamber of Congress, and 
Congress has always had the final say 
on their local affairs. This is uniquely 
un-American. It is undemocratic. 
For me, it is deeply personal. My own 
family has lived in D.C. since my great- 
grandfather Richard Holmes as a slave 
walked away from a plantation in Vir-
ginia and made his way to D.C. almost 
200 years ago. Richard Holmes made it 
as far as D.C., a walk to freedom but 
not to equal citizenship so far for our 
family. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1971 
April 20, 2021 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia an additional 1 minute. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia is recognized for an additional 1 
minute. 
Ms. NORTON. During debate on D.C. 
statehood Thursday, we will make the 
case that Congress has the constitu-
tional authority to admit the State of 
Washington, D.C., and that the State 
would meet all the elements Congress 
has considered in admission decisions. 
For now, it is sufficient to note that 
throughout its existence in the United 
States the United States has flattered 
itself as a democracy, even though it is 
the only democratic country that de-
nies voting representation in the na-
tional legislature to the residents of 
the capital. With passage of this rule 
today and the D.C. statehood bill on 
Thursday, the United States will be 
one step closer to deserving the term 
democracy. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentlewoman very much 
for her comments, and I want to reem-
phasize the point that she made at the 
end, which is that Congress has the ex-
clusive authority to admit new States. 
Congress has admitted 37 new States. 
None of them have ever been struck 
down by a court, despite serious con-
stitutional 
objections 
being 
raised 
against almost every State. 
Everyone knew that Hawaii and 
Alaska could not be admitted because 
they were not contiguous. Everyone 
knew that Texas couldn’t be admitted 
because it was a separate republic, and 
there was no authority to admit a re-
public to the Union. It was said Utah 
couldn’t be admitted because they were 
practicing polygamy there. And so on. 
There have always been constitu-
tional objections made, but the courts 
have always deemed this to be a polit-
ical question, which means that, in the 
juridical context, it is up to Congress 
to decide. And Congress has always 
been guided, in the final analysis, by 
the overriding dynamic of American 
political history, which is democracy 
has to govern for people who live here. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, my colleague may 
have said that these are merely my as-
sertions. They are certainly my argu-
ments, but they are also supported by 
others, particularly well-known mem-
bers of the liberal party. 
The former Mayor of D.C. himself, 
Mayor Walter Washington, said: ‘‘I 
would have problems with statehood in 
terms of exacting from it some en-
claves, or little enclaves all around the 
city. Ultimately, it seems to me that 
would erode the very fabric of the city 
itself and the viability of the city.’’ 
Again, that was the former Mayor of 
Washington, D.C., who was talking 
about the enclaves that are being 
called for in this bill. 
Additionally, the former D.C. Dele-
gate Walter Fauntroy himself said that 
a bill like this would be in direct defi-
ance of the prescription of the Found-
ing Fathers. 
As far as the constitutional argu-
ment, it is not just me making the as-
sertion that this would be unconstitu-
tional because there is an issue, and 
that is the 23rd Amendment. Don’t 
take it from me. Look at the Carter ad-
ministration DOJ. They said that to 
provide statehood for the District 
would have to be by constitutional 
amendment. Otherwise, it would ignore 
the Framer’s intent. 
John Harmon, Assistant Attorney 
General for the Office of Legal Counsel 
during the Carter administration, said 
that this would have to be accom-
plished through constitutional amend-
ment. 
Further, RFK, Robert Kennedy, said 
that Congress likely did not have the 
authority under Article I, Section 8, 
clause 17 to shrink the Federal district 
to essentially the same size that is 
being discussed. 
The argument that the Federal dis-
trict constituting the seat of govern-
ment is a permanent part of our con-
stitutional 
system 
is 
substantially 
strengthened by the adoption of the 
23rd Amendment. Thinking that we can 
merely repeal an amendment through 
legislative action, that is not how the 
Constitution works; otherwise, you 
wouldn’t have had the 21st Amend-
ment, which was needed to repeal the 
18th Amendment. We could have just 
merely repealed it. 
Additionally, there are talks about 
this not being a political exercise. My 
colleague has been quoted, actually, in 
The 
Washington 
Post 
saying 
that 
‘‘there is a national political logic for 
it’’—‘‘it’’ being D.C. statehood. Because 
the Senate has become the principal 
obstacle to social progress on a whole 
range of issues—not my words; my col-
league’s words—this issue is all about a 
power grab. 
We are talking about another issue 
that is on this rule, immigration. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider H.R. 2321, the Border Surge Re-
sponse and Resilience Act. For far too 
long, 
Democrats 
denied 
the 
crisis 
caused by Biden’s open-border rhetoric. 
This bipartisan bill will ensure that 
DHS develops a plan and has the re-
sources it needs to address migrant 
surges and secure our border. Some-
thing is clearly missing from the cur-
rent administration. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
any extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO), the lead Republican 
on the House Committee on Homeland 
Security, my good friend and col-
league, here to explain the amendment. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to moving the previous 
question so that we can consider the 
bipartisan 
legislation 
I 
introduced, 
along with several of my colleagues, to 
address a crisis along the southwest 
border and provide resources for the 
men and women of the Department of 
Homeland Security who are serving on 
the front lines of this security and hu-
manitarian nightmare created by the 
policies of this administration. 
Madam Speaker, the Border Surge 
Response and Resilience Act is a com-
monsense approach for preparing for 
future migrant surges and is a direct 
response to a recommendation of the 
bipartisan and effective Homeland Se-
curity Advisory Council, which I hope 
will be reconstituted by the current ad-
ministration. 
I often hear from my friends on the 
other side of the aisle accusing Repub-
licans of complaining about problems 
rather than offering solutions. Well, 
today, we are providing the oppor-
tunity to vote on a commonsense, bi-
partisan, and thoughtful solution. 
I just returned from my second trip 
to the border in recent weeks. Any of 
us who have traveled there recently 
can observe what is happening and can 
attest to just how bad the crisis on the 
ground really is. 
At the border itself, it is wide open. 
The wall construction has stopped. 
Border Patrol agents have told us if 
the wall is constructed, 80 percent of 
the drug-trafficking activity is focused 
and funneled to other areas where they 
can easily interdict the drug traf-
fickers. 
Madam Speaker, I was a Federal or-
ganized crime prosecutor for 20 years 
before coming to Congress, and I 
worked on the border as a Federal or-
ganized crime prosecutor going after 
cartels. I can tell you that they own 
the border. 
If someone wants to cross the border, 
they have to pay. Chinese are paying 
$50,000 to $70,000 per person. Mexicans 
and Central Americans are paying 
$4,000 a person to come across. 
Every single day that this crisis goes 
on, the cartels are being enriched to 
the tune of at least $15 million a day. 
In the last month, it is highly likely 
they were probably enriched to the 
tune of close to $1 billion in a month. 
The Border Patrol agents are de-
spondent. They are being pulled off the 
line, at least 40 to 50 percent at a time, 
in the Rio Grande sector alone to deal 
with the crisis. The drug traffickers

are smart enough to know: If I throw 
100 people across the border over here, 
all the agents have to come off and 
deal with them. And then that place 
that they came off from, we are going 
to go right across there with the drugs. 
In the Rio Grande Valley sector 
alone is a 2,000 percent increase in 
fentanyl coming across the border. 
Fentanyl is killing our kids all over 
this country. It is mixed with heroin; it 
is killing our kids. That is what the 
Border Patrol agents are telling us be-
cause all they want to do is to be able 
to enforce the laws on the books and to 
have the ability to do so. They do not 
have the ability to do so because of the 
administration’s change of policies on 
January 22. They say there is a direct 
correlation. 
Yes, there are problems in Central 
America. They have been there for 20 
to 30 years; they haven’t changed. If I 
had kids down there, I would bring 
them up to the border, too. But there is 
a right way to do things, and there is a 
wrong way. Running across the border 
and creating this crisis is the wrong 
way. 
Madam Speaker, let me tell you what 
I saw at the detention centers like 
Donna. 
People are put in pens, for lack of a 
better term. Thirty, forty people are 
supposed to be in there. I saw hundreds. 
I sent a picture to my wife. There are 
so many kids. They were all wrapped 
up in aluminum blankets. You couldn’t 
see anything other than the aluminum 
blankets. They were literally stacked 
next to each other like cordwood. 
Not a single child was tested. They 
are released from that facility because 
they just can’t keep them there, and 
they are released without being tested. 
When we were at the border, we en-
countered a couple of people at the bor-
der at midnight. The next morning, on 
a flight to Dallas-Forth Worth, they 
were on that flight. No ID. No idea who 
they were. 
They put them on a plane without 
identification. They put them on a 
plane highly likely without testing be-
cause they said they are not testing 
right away. But when they do test, 
they know that 10 to 15 percent of 
these kids test positive for COVID. 
They are putting people in our com-
munities all across this country, not 
telling those communities that they 
are coming, and they are coming. They 
are oftentimes not being tested for 
COVID and, obviously, probably posi-
tive. 
That is what is going on. In the 
Donna facility alone, we are spending 
millions of dollars a day to deal with 
this. There is nothing more tragic than 
seeing an 11-year-old girl who was sex-
ually assaulted on her way up to the 
border and who is pregnant there. 
That is what is going on. That is the 
reality of the situation, and it is an 
unforced error that we didn’t need to 
have. 
The administration, candidly, was 
caught short. But candidly, too, pre-
vious 
administrations 
were 
caught 
short with border surges. 
So, I am not here to complain about 
the situation. I am here to offer a solu-
tion, and the solution is our bill, which 
I mentioned. 
In addition to ensuring future pre-
paredness along the border, this provi-
sion will create a $1 billion fund to be 
made available in support of our front-
line enforcement personnel. It requires 
transparent metrics that were trig-
gered when certain events happened, 
and it supports border security and law 
enforcement professionals. This fund-
ing would help prevent a humanitarian 
crisis from spiraling out of control, as 
it has on this one and on others before 
it, candidly. 
If you don’t know this, I will tell you: 
The money that is being spent to deal 
with this crisis now is being taken 
away from the funds set aside for the 
salaries of our law enforcement profes-
sionals on the border. That is a fact. 
We are going to need a massive supple-
ment just to make sure that our Bor-
der Patrol agents can get paid. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, in a bipartisan fashion, to sup-
port the security of the United States. 
This is not about arguing over what 
President Biden did on January 20. 
This is about saying, going forward, 
when we have these crises—and they 
will occur again—that we are ready 
next time, that there is money set 
aside, that there is a plan, and that 
when certain things happen, the money 
kicks in and we are ready to go. 
That is what I am asking my col-
leagues, to support the frontline men 
and women by supporting this provi-
sion. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to say a word in response to my col-
league about the national political 
logic of statehood. 
There is both powerful constitutional 
principle and national political logic 
that infuses every statehood admission 
going back to the very beginning of the 
Republic. 
The constitutional principle is sim-
ply that of no taxation without rep-
resentation and the consent of the gov-
erned. People who are part of the 
American Nation should be able to par-
ticipate equally as complete citizens. 
That is why Thomas Jefferson set out 
in the Northwest Ordinance that once a 
community got to be of a certain size— 
60,000, which, of course, is less than 10 
percent of the size of Washington, D.C., 
today—that it would be eligible to 
come into statehood, to petition for 
statehood. The only real constitutional 
prerequisite is a republican form of 
government, that is the Republican 
Guarantee Clause. 
That is the high-minded political 
ideal of constitutional principle, but it 
is also the case, as I have tried to argue 
with my colleagues across the aisle, 
that there is a hardcore political logic 
that is operated, and we see it in their 
arguments that they don’t want to 
admit two Democratic Senators to the 
Republic, which is what former Presi-
dent Trump said in objection to D.C. 
statehood. He said there is no way we 
would accept two new Democrat Sen-
ators. 
Actually, although I consider it a 
degradation of the process and a sort of 
tawdry form of argument, nonetheless, 
it has been very much part of Amer-
ican political history, which is why 
States have tended to enter the Union 
in pairs, like animals boarding Noah’s 
Ark together. 
That was the situation with Kansas 
and Nebraska, in the Kansas-Nebraska 
Act; that was the situation of Missouri 
and 
Maine 
in 
the 
Missouri 
Com-
promise; that was Vermont and Ken-
tucky; that was Alaska and Hawaii 
back in 1959. 
So, I say to my friends, okay, they 
don’t see the problem of taxation with-
out 
representation 
in 
Washington. 
They don’t see the problem of govern-
ance 
without 
representation. 
They 
don’t see the irony or the paradox or 
the contradiction of people putting 
their lives on the line to defend this 
Congress, this Union, on January 6 who 
don’t get to vote for voting representa-
tives in Congress. 
They don’t want to see that, fine. But 
they can at least see this: It has been 
in the Republican platform since 1940 
that Puerto Rico should be admitted as 
a State. Every 4 years, they have said 
that the millions of people, American 
citizens, who live in Puerto Rico 
should be admitted as a State. It was 
in the platform in 2016. It would have 
been in 2020 if they had had a platform. 
They decided not to have a platform 
for the American people in 2020. But in 
any event, they have taken a very 
strong position—Ronald Reagan, Ger-
ald Ford, you name it. 
In fact, the Resident Commissioner 
from Puerto Rico is a Republican who 
has introduced statehood legislation in 
this Congress, who is fighting for state-
hood. 
So, fine, there is the basis for com-
mon ground. Let’s get together. The 
Democrats have been arguing for state-
hood for Washington, D.C., for a long 
time. The Republicans have been argu-
ing for statehood for Puerto Rico for a 
long time. I assume everybody means 
it. Let’s get together and do it the way 
this has happened periodically, system-
atically, throughout American history. 
That is the national political logic of 
allowing both of these states to come 
in together. 
Not everybody gets everything that 
they want, and I do think that it is 
antithetical to the democratic form of 
government to say you don’t want peo-
ple to be represented because you don’t 
like the way they are going to vote be-
cause they disagree with you on issues. 
I think that is fundamentally undemo-
cratic and un-American. 
Madam Speaker, in any event, we 
have the grounds for a compromise, 
and I am still looking for some col-
leagues across the aisle to stand up and 
say they will stand for the position

that they have embraced for decades, 
to say these two states should come in 
together. 
b 1515 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
my colleague from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the rule pro-
viding for consideration of the NO BAN 
Act, the Access to Counsel Act of 2021, 
and the Washington, D.C. Admission 
Act. All three bills advance important 
policies that I am proud to support. 
I will never forgot the night in Janu-
ary 2017 that the Trump administra-
tion’s ban on travel from Muslim coun-
tries went into effect. I was not yet in 
Congress, and my job involved coordi-
nating free legal services across the 
U.S., including representation for im-
migrants. 
As foreign citizens landed in the U.S., 
they were told that their travel papers 
were revoked while they were in the 
air, and some were taken into custody 
and some were immediately deported. 
Families were separated, and friends 
and relatives arriving to pick up loved 
ones at U.S. airports frantically tried 
to get information about them. Many 
were denied the right to counsel, who 
were trying to reach them. 
Attorneys and immigration agencies 
across the country immediately mobi-
lized to help those impacted by the il-
legal and ill-conceived ban. I spent the 
next few weeks working around the 
clock, dispatching volunteers to air-
ports, mobilizing translators, and orga-
nizing legal efforts. 
Having seen the chaos and cruelty 
caused by the Trump administration’s 
ill-fated ban, I am particularly pleased 
by the opportunity to pass the NO BAN 
Act and the Access to Counsel Act. 
First, the NO BAN Act would ensure 
that no future administration would 
have the authority to discriminate 
against people based on their religious 
background or national origin when 
choosing to restrict the entry of immi-
grants into our country. 
Having witnessed the chaos and cru-
elty of the Muslim ban, I whole-
heartedly 
support 
this 
legislation, 
which would prevent future adminis-
trations from similarly abusing their 
executive authority. 
I am also proud to support the Access 
to Counsel Act, which would ensure 
that individuals at ports of entry can 
seek legal advice, whether from volun-
teers or at their own expense, during 
the screening process. Access to coun-
sel is critical for ensuring the fair and 
equitable enforcement of our laws, but 
especially 
in 
immigration 
matters 
where the law is so complicated and 
the consequences so grave. 
Madam Speaker, I support these 
three bills, which would make our im-
migration laws more fair and protect 
due process. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we hear a lot about 
no taxation without representation. 
But there is representation. We forget 
that D.C. has three electoral votes. 
That is the 23rd Amendment. They 
have a Delegate in Congress. They also 
have local government and a mayor. 
They have the Home Rule Act. 
But taxation does bring up a serious 
issue because D.C. would need to raise 
taxes if it were to become a State. It 
simply is not self-sufficient economi-
cally. In fact, D.C. takes more from the 
Federal Government than any other 
area in the United States; $73,000 per 
capita, to be exact. That is astronom-
ical when you think about it. The sec-
ond highest State is Virginia at $16,000 
per capita, followed by Maryland at 
$15,000 per capita. Again, D.C. takes 
$73,000 per capita. 
If this were to go through, D.C. would 
need to raise revenue. Because of the 
massive amount of Federal land in the 
District, you would then have to have 
more taxation, presumably through 
two ways: One, a commuter tax, taxing 
people that come into the District from 
other areas; or, two, you would have to 
have tolling of roads leading into the 
District. Both of these are incredibly 
problematic. 
The first one, a commuter tax, would 
actually create the problem my liberal 
colleagues are saying exists in the first 
place, no taxation without representa-
tion, because you would have the Dis-
trict of Columbia taxing people from, 
presumably, Virginia, Maryland, West 
Virginia, where have you, for com-
muting 
into 
the 
District. 
They 
wouldn’t 
have 
representation 
here. 
That is actually taxation without rep-
resentation. 
Further, if you were to toll roads 
leading into the District, you would in-
fringe 
upon 
people’s 
constitutional 
rights to petition the government. 
Imagine how much a tour bus would 
have to pay if they wanted to come 
here in the District. 
But I was talking about the Home 
Rule Act and I was talking about the 
23rd Amendment, and it reminded me 
that there was an allegation that Re-
publicans somehow don’t care about 
this issue. It is actually the opposite. 
Republicans are the ones who have ad-
vanced more rights for the District of 
Columbia. Think about it. 
It was actually the Kennedy and the 
Carter administrations, both their De-
partments of Justice concluded that, 
for D.C. to be a State, it would require 
a 
constitutional 
amendment. 
They 
were on our side of this argument. His-
torically, it was President Eisenhower 
who pushed through the 23rd Amend-
ment to get D.C. three electoral votes. 
And just a side note, it was Republican, 
Prescott Bush, grandfather of George 
W. Bush, who was instrumental in pass-
ing the 23rd Amendment. They were 
both Republicans. And it was President 
Nixon who signed the Home Rule Act 
into law. This has been Republican-led 
since the very beginning. 
There was also an argument about 
D.C. residents, that this is somehow a 
civil rights issue. Civil rights, that is 
an actual term of art. Civil rights is a 
violation when the rights are denied 
because a person is who the person is. 
D.C. residents don’t have a lack of rep-
resentation in Congress because of who 
they are, but, instead, of where they 
choose to live. 
And this isn’t just me making this 
argument. The late Democrat, Rep-
resentative John Dingell, made a simi-
lar argument, and I will quote the late 
Representative Dingell: ‘‘I have sup-
ported every single civil rights meas-
ure that has passed this Congress since 
1955, but we have to look at the facts 
before us. No citizen in Washington, 
D.C., is chained to the pillars of the 
U.S. Capitol. They can leave any time 
they want. To say this is somehow a 
civil rights violation is insulting to ac-
tual civil rights violations.’’ 
Then let’s go back to the three elec-
toral votes issue. If we do follow this 
course of action and not repeal the 23rd 
Amendment before enacting D.C. state-
hood, you are going to have, as my col-
league from Maryland just admitted, a 
sloppy and messy situation where the 
new State gets three electoral votes, 
and then the Federal enclave gets three 
electoral votes. 
Well, who lives in the Federal en-
clave? 
It would be the First Family. 
So you would, presumably, give the 
incumbent three electoral votes in the 
election, and then D.C. itself three 
electoral votes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. 
BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to the combined rule and to the 
underlying measures, including H.R. 51, 
the Washington, D.C. Admission Act. 
Once again, our friends across the 
aisle are making an attempt to gain 
more control in Congress, this time in 
the Senate, by trying to hide behind 
the guise that residents of the District 
of Columbia do not have the means for 
adequate representation in Congress. 
While Americans deserve full voting 
representation from their national gov-
ernment, our forefathers never in-
tended for the Federal seat of govern-
ment to serve as a State. The Founders 
intended the Capitol to be a neutral 
ground for equal sovereign States to 
work together to conduct the Nation’s 
business. 
This bill does not at all follow what 
our forefathers envisioned. H.R. 51 
overlooks the U.S. Constitution in 
which Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 
designated Washington as a Federal 
district, not a State. That alone should 
make this legislation unconstitutional. 
Because the District of Columbia’s 
status is spelled out, it would take a 
constitutional amendment to grant 
permission for this Democratic power 
play. There have been several alter-
native proposals and amendments put

H1974 
April 20, 2021 
forward by Republicans, none of which 
have been heard. 
My colleague, Representative DUSTY 
JOHNSON from South Dakota, has pro-
posed the District of Columbia-Mary-
land Reunion Act, which I have cospon-
sored, that would revert the majority 
of D.C. residential areas back to the 
State of Maryland. The National Mall 
and other Federal buildings would re-
main as the District of Columbia. Be-
fore we create a new State, we should 
return D.C.’s residential areas back to 
the original State they were served. 
With H.R. 51, Democrats have yet 
again failed to examine the con-
sequences of their rushed actions to 
gain more control in Congress. The 
District of Columbia has received bil-
lions of dollars from the Federal Gov-
ernment to fund its entire judicial 
branch of government, among other 
things, which would end under state-
hood. 
But 
Democrats 
weren’t 
thinking 
about how to make D.C. a State before 
proposing H.R. 51. The only thought in 
their minds was two more Senate 
seats, more control of the government, 
more control of the American taxpayer 
dollars, more out-of-control spending, 
more Federal overreach into the lives 
of everyday Americans. 
We have been down this path many 
times in Congress, voting yet again on 
a bill that has had no input from Re-
publicans, nor has had much chance of 
receiving any Republican support on 
the floor. 
President Biden was elected on the 
premise of working together with Re-
publicans, extending a hand across the 
aisle to do what is best for the Amer-
ican people. I have struggled to find 
many examples of that bipartisanship 
to share with my constituents in Okla-
homa. But what I do have are plenty of 
examples of Democratic power plays, 
an unwillingness to let the voices of 
Republicans be heard, and H.R. 51 
stands as a prime example of both. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to oppose the combined rule 
and to oppose H.R. 51. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
gentlewoman invites us to return the 
District of Columbia to Maryland, 
which, of course, debunks the argu-
ment that Congress cannot modify the 
boundaries of the District of Columbia. 
But, in any event, that is not what 
the people of Washington, D.C. have 
asked for. They have used their rights 
as American citizens under the Ninth 
Amendment of the Constitution to or-
ganize a new State and to petition Con-
gress for admission to the Union. Nei-
ther has the Maryland General Assem-
bly asked for a return of the land to 
Maryland. So that certainly answers a 
set of political conditions that don’t 
exist in the real world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Maryland 
for yielding. And I particularly thank 
the gentlewoman from Washington, 
D.C., the 51st State, the Honorable EL-
EANOR HOLMES NORTON for her hard 
work. 
Madam Speaker, breaking news: The 
people of Washington, D.C., pay taxes. 
Breaking news: They wear the uniform 
of the United States of America. And, 
breaking news: The legislation my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
are proposing is to propose a dictation, 
as usual, from the United States Fed-
eral Government on the people of 
Washington, D.C. 
Is anybody in Washington, D.C., rais-
ing their hand to be able to participate 
in the legislation that my friends are 
offering on this floor, which is to parti-
tion—we know what partition means— 
colored people in dominance and put 
them wherever the Federal Govern-
ment thinks that they should belong? 
I think they need to think twice 
about that. 
And, really, if this is a country of the 
people and for the people, if this is a 
House of Representatives, then the peo-
ple of Washington, D.C., deserve to be 
represented, and they deserve to be 
represented by the four squares of the 
dictates and vote of the people of the 
United States Congress. 
I am appalled that we would, over the 
decades, ignore the blood that was shed 
by those from Washington, D.C., the 
history that was made by those from 
Washington, D.C., and the service that 
was given by those from Washington, 
D.C. 
So I rise to support the legislation 
that provides for the Washington, D.C. 
Admission Act, H.R. 51. I thank the 
leadership for that legislation. In the 
rule, we have a combination of restor-
ing rights. That is what H.R. 51 does, 
restoring and igniting rights. 
H.R. 1573, Access to Counsel Act, of 
my friend and colleague from Wash-
ington State, is a commonsense initia-
tive. 
We are a nation of laws. 
Do we not respect the right to coun-
sel? 
Yes, these are persons who are non-
citizens, but they have the right, if in 
secondary detention, to call a relative, 
to call a lawyer, which they pay for. 
What about little Ali? 
As I rushed to the airport on that 
fateful day when the President of the 
United States, President Trump, de-
clared that all Muslims were banned, 
what an outrageous experience; and an 
outrageous experience that I have had 
with other entries that have been de-
tained, where they couldn’t call an 
uncle or aunt, they couldn’t call their 
mother, their father, their wife. 
Well, little Ali could not call his rel-
atives that were outside the gate wait-
ing for him. 
Where did that 15-year-old Egyptian 
with documented papers wind up? 
He wound up in Chicago, in a chil-
dren’s detention facility. 
So I support the right to counsel, 
H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel Act. 
And, finally, H.R. 1333. Ali came 
under the Bagram ban by President 
Trump; let’s just say it, an outrageous 
act. We literally got off the plane, 
Members of Congress who were flying 
in from Washington, and rushed to the 
airport because of what was happening 
to our constituents. 
I support the NO BAN Act under H.R. 
1333, and I ask my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. The Constitution 
reigns. 
b 1530 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, there was talk about retroces-
sion. There can be arguments that the 
former retrocession was actually un-
constitutional. In fact, the House of 
Representatives tried to pass a bill to 
say just that. It passed, and it, unfortu-
nately, sat in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee without passing and chal-
lenges to the Supreme Court were dis-
missed on procedural grounds. 
Additionally, we have to remember 
the many reasons why the District is 
just that, a district. It is because the 
Founding Fathers did not want to cre-
ate an imperial State that would have 
too much influence and control over 
the Capitol. 
My colleague from Maryland actu-
ally wrote about this in 1990 in a law 
review article published in the Catholic 
University Law Review. ‘‘The Rep-
resentatives from the new State, likely 
living minutes from their offices, will 
theoretically devote more time to in-
stitutional and committee politics and 
less to constant travel back and forth 
across the country, increasing their 
importance and influence on Capitol 
Hill.’’ 
That was my colleague from Mary-
land. That is not my assertion. 
If D.C. does become a State, Madam 
Speaker, you will create almost by def-
inition a super Congressman in this 
body and two super Senators that yield 
much more influence than others who 
have to travel back and forth to their 
district. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, the 
underlying legislation we are consid-
ering in this rule is extremely alarm-
ing. We have two out-of-touch immi-
gration bills that do nothing to address 
our current immigration crisis, and 
then we have a partisan priority that 
reeks of the swamp and is simply un-
constitutional. 
H.R. 1333 restricts any President’s 
authority to suspend entry into the 
United States from certain foreign na-
tionals for national security or public 
health reasons putting the safety of 
Americans at risk. 
With H.R. 1573, it appears my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
plan to address the crisis at our south-
ern border by sending in the lawyers. 
President Biden created this crisis with 
his policies, and this bill just continues 
to encourage more people to come and 
cross our border illegally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1975 
April 20, 2021 
We wrap up this rule with the most 
ridiculous legislation of all, the uncon-
stitutional H.R. 51. Our Founders envi-
sioned our Nation’s Capitol set apart 
from the States and enshrined that in 
our Constitution. No action by this 
body can make Washington, D.C. a 
State, nor is there a reason to take 
such action other than to ensure the 
Democratic Party receives two more 
seats in the United States Senate. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in opposi-
tion to the underlying bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote against the rule. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I rise in strong support of this reso-
lution. It makes in order that we will 
not discriminate against people based 
upon their religion or the State from 
which they come or the nation from 
which they come. It says not at our 
cost, but at their cost they have the 
right to consult counsel. That seems to 
me to be a basic premise in America. 
Then, thirdly, which we hear so much 
lamentation about, it gives to 700,000- 
plus people in the District of Columbia 
equal status with the 500,000 people in 
Wyoming. How terrible. Now, perhaps 
if my friends from the other side of the 
aisle, Madam Speaker, thought that 
there were going to be two Republican 
Senators elected, they would be for it. 
I say perhaps, but I believe there is no 
doubt about that. 
I am proud to be a strong supporter 
of that legislation, and I will tell my 
Republican friends who talk about 
human rights around the world so 
often—properly so—that Washington, 
D.C., is the only capital in the free 
world whose residents do not have a 
representative in the parliament of 
their country—the only one. 
There is no reason why the gentle-
woman who sits in front of me, ELEA-
NOR
HOLMES
NORTON—who is an ex-
traordinary American and an extraor-
dinary patriot who serves her Nation 
so incredibly well and is elected by 
those 700,000 people—why she is less 
than we because ELEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON cannot vote on final passage of a 
bill. 
Now, I did, as the majority leader, at 
least give her the respect and the re-
spect to others who are representatives 
of their particular areas—Puerto Rico, 
American Samoa, Guam, the Northern 
Mariana Islands—the right to vote in 
the Committee of the Whole to let 
them know at least in that small way 
we wanted to give voice to the folks 
they represent. 
So I rise in strong support of this 
rule. We have passed these bills before. 
Republicans opposed them before, and 
they will oppose them again. I am not 
surprised. 
Madam Speaker, before I sit, how-
ever, I want to speak about another 
issue. We are expecting the Republican 
leader to offer a privileged resolution 
at the conclusion of the debate on this 
rule. I am disappointed at that news. 
His resolution is being used by Repub-
licans to posit a moral equivalence be-
tween a comment by the gentlewoman 
from California about standing up for 
justice and peaceful protest and re-
marks by Representative GREENE who 
directly 
threatened 
violence 
by 
retweeting a tweet. I understand it was 
not her words, but she retweeted those 
words which said that if you want to 
shut Pelosi up, a bullet to the head will 
accomplish that objective. She didn’t 
say it. I want to make that clear. She 
retweeted a tweet that said that. 
Even more egregiously, it is being 
used to twist reality to suggest that 
somehow Congresswoman WATERS’ re-
mark is as condemnable a remark as 
rhetoric that incites a violent attempt 
to overthrow the government of the 
United States on January 6, an action 
that Republicans refuse to condemn. 
There is no equivalence. 
Chairwoman WATERS’ remarks re-
flect the very profound anger and sense 
of hopelessness that she and so many 
others—myself included—feel when we 
see African Americans being killed 
during encounters with our law en-
forcement and their families not seeing 
justice. 
It is my understanding we are going 
to get a ruling almost perhaps any 
minute. We will see. 
It is, however, irresponsible to take 
Chairwoman WATERS’ remarks out of 
context just to hold a gotcha partisan 
vote, particularly when no action was 
taken by her party regarding Mrs. 
GREENE’s remarks. 
It is, frankly, exploiting the pain of 
so many families and communities to 
turn Chairwoman WATERS’ concern for 
justice into a partisan cudgel. 
As my friend, the dearly departed 
Elijah Cummings used to say and 
would surely say now, ‘‘We are better 
than this.’’ 
So when the minority leader offers 
his motion, I will offer a motion to 
table and urge all my colleagues to 
support that motion. 
I urge all of my colleagues to pick up 
their dictionary, turn to the Cs, and 
look up confront. Confront is to face 
the facts. Confront is to face the truth. 
Confront is to face the challenges that 
we have, and that is what Ms. WATERS 
urged. 
I would suggest to my friend, the mi-
nority leader, Madam Speaker, that if 
confrontation is subject to sanction, 
then we are going to have a lot of peo-
ple on his side of the aisle who we be-
lieve are confrontational every day. 
Confront is not violence. Confront is 
not waving guns and some groups’ big-
gest fear. Confront is not to say to be 
violent in confronting the facts, the 
truth, the opportunities, and the chal-
lenges, and, yes, the alternatives that 
we all take. 
So if one of us stands up and says 
that we need to confront this and we 
need to be confrontational and we need 
to get up in people’s faces and say: This 
is the truth and we need to act and 
that would be subject to admonition, 
then I suggest to my friend, Madam 
Speaker, and my friends in this House, 
that we all confront. 
We came here to represent people and 
to confront their needs, to confront 
their fears, and to confront their 
wants. Now, yes, you could say, well, 
that is advocacy. Of course, it is. So I 
ask my friends not only to vote for this 
rule, but to vote for the motion to 
table my friend’s motion that I antici-
pate. 
We could spend all our time here, 
Madam Speaker. We have been on this 
side of the aisle, as my friend, the lead-
er knows, and we haven’t had all the 
resolutions that have been introduced 
on my side of the aisle. This makes it 
harder, however, not to proceed on nu-
merous resolutions on my side of the 
aisle. Let us table this resolution on 
behalf of this institution and every 
Member in it. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time to close. 
b 1545 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, it is interesting to 
hear my colleague from Maryland’s 
newfound positions because, in the 
1990s, I believe the majority leader ac-
tually had the opposite viewpoint and 
took the opposite vote. But then again, 
things can change, and so can opinions. 
It is also interesting to hear my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
use D.C.’s population as some justifica-
tion for D.C. statehood. We know that 
the Founding Fathers knew that D.C. 
would grow into a large metropolis. 
George Washington, when he was lay-
ing out the land use of the city, he ac-
tually used Paris as the example for 
the city, which was at the time 800,000 
residents. They used one of the biggest 
cities in Europe as an example of the 
city because they knew the District of 
Columbia would grow into a thriving 
metropolis. Yet, they still wanted to 
carve out D.C. as an independent dis-
trict, not as a State. The argument 
that there are now some 700,000 resi-
dents of D.C. is a nonstarter if you are 
going back to the historical intent of 
the Founding Fathers. 
But let’s talk about the border crisis. 
There has been a 400 percent increase 
in illegal border crossings compared to 
March 2020. Yet, today, we are consid-
ering a rule bringing up two immigra-
tion bills that do absolutely nothing to 
address this crisis. 
Again, we are calling up a rule on 
H.R. 51 that is the Democrat’s uncon-
stitutional attempt to ram through 
D.C. statehood for their own political 
gain. What is that gain? It is very sim-
ple. It is bringing in two ultraliberal 
Senators. D.C. is the most liberal city, 
second only to San Francisco, and this 
bill bringing two ultraliberal Senators 
into the Senate with the idea of abol-
ishing the filibuster is to what end? To 
pack 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
to 
ram 
through a far-left, radical agenda.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1976 
April 20, 2021 
For those reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the un-
derlying measure. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, let me start by say-
ing that the majority leader hardly 
needs me to defend him, but I know 
that he was a strong supporter of the 
D.C. 
voting 
rights 
constitutional 
amendment where there was actually 
bipartisan support. 
In those days, Republicans under-
stood the grievous injustice being per-
petrated against the people of Wash-
ington, D.C., and they supported grant-
ing people in D.C. two Senators, or 
what my colleague would call two 
ultraliberal Senators, as well as the 
Representatives in the House to which 
they were due. 
There were certainly people who were 
saying there were other ways of accom-
plishing it. Now, unfortunately, that 
bipartisan consensus collapsed even 
though it passed the Senate and the 
House back in the day. I don’t hear any 
of my colleagues saying they are for it 
now. 
Mr. HOYER, the majority leader, is 
supporting the only viable vehicle for 
getting equal rights for people in Wash-
ington, D.C., that exists today, which 
is statehood, which is how 37 new 
States entered the Union with Con-
gress’ exercise of its powers under Arti-
cle IV of the Constitution. 
The gentleman waxed eloquent about 
the vision of a great Capital City, but 
being a strict textualist, I assume that 
he wants to pay some attention to the 
text of the Constitution. Article I, Sec-
tion 8, Clause 17, the District Clause, 
sets a maximum, a ceiling that the Dis-
trict may be no more than 10 miles 
square, but there is no minimum there. 
It didn’t say it must be at least 6 miles 
square or 2 miles square or 3 miles. No, 
that is up to Congress. In other words, 
it is a political question within con-
gressional power, our plenary power, 
over the District of Columbia. 
Finally, the gentleman, I suppose, 
gets to the heart of the matter when he 
says that, for him, it is all about two 
ultraliberal Senators. I would ask 
every Member of this body to think 
about that for a second, reflect on that. 
In America, I don’t think we deny peo-
ple voting rights based on how they are 
going to vote. I don’t think we deny en-
tire States and political communities 
representation based on predictions of 
who they might elect. 
In fact, there is a Supreme Court 
case about that called Carrington v. 
Rash. When armed services members in 
Texas were disenfranchised because it 
was suggested they would vote in a way 
more identified with the national gov-
ernment than with local cultural val-
ues in Texas, the Supreme Court 
struck it down and said that, in Amer-
ican democracy, we do not allow gov-
ernment to disenfranchise people based 
on predictions of how they are going to 
vote or who they are going to elect. 
That is precisely what the gentleman 
invites us to do here, to deny 712,000 
taxpaying, draftable U.S. citizens, who 
came to our aid on January 6, to deny 
them their equal rights under the 
Union, under the flag, because he pre-
dicts that they are going to elect peo-
ple whose policy views are contrary to 
his own. 
Madam Speaker, I would suggest that 
is totally antithetical to the meaning 
of American constitutional democracy. 
Everyone should take a walk around 
Washington. You will see flags in the 
yards of all the people here, yards that 
we pass by every day when we come to 
Washington, and they say, ‘‘D.C. 51.’’ 
They want their statehood. Let’s listen 
to the people of Washington. 
If you can’t quite stomach that, then 
read the Republican Party platform 
itself, which calls for Puerto Rican 
statehood, and let’s see if we can do it 
together. Let’s bring in millions of dis-
enfranchised people in America. 
Still, I get radio silence from my col-
leagues on that. Not a single one will 
opine about whether or not the people 
of Puerto Rico should be admitted as a 
State. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and 
the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 330 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 2321) to direct the Secretary of Home-
land Security to establish a plan to respond 
to irregular migration surges at the border, 
to establish an irregular migration surge 
border response fund, and for other purposes. 
The first reading of the bill shall be dis-
pensed with. All points of order against con-
sideration of the bill are waived. General de-
bate shall be confined to the bill and shall 
not exceed one hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity. After general debate the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the five- 
minute rule. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. When the com-
mittee rises and reports the bill back to the 
House with a recommendation that the bill 
do pass, the previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and amend-
ments thereto to final passage without inter-
vening motion except one motion to recom-
mit. If the Committee of the Whole rises and 
reports that it has come to no resolution on 
the bill, then on the next legislative day the 
House shall, immediately after the third 
daily order of business under clause 1 of rule 
XIV, resolve into the Committee of the 
Whole for further consideration of the bill. 
SEC. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 2321. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
RAISING A QUESTION OF 
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to a question of the privileges of 
the House, and I offer H. Res. 331. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 331 
Whereas on the evening of April 17, 2021, 
Representative Maxine M. Waters of Cali-
fornia joined protestors in Brooklyn Center, 
Minnesota, who were gathered outside the 
Brooklyn Center Police Department; 
Whereas Representative Maxine M. Waters 
said, ‘‘We’re looking for a guilty verdict’’ in 
the trial of Derek Chauvin; 
Whereas Representative Maxine M. Waters 
said that if there was not a guilty verdict, 
protestors on the street should ‘‘. . . Stay on 
the street, and we’ve got to get more active, 
we’ve got to get more confrontational, we’ve 
got to make sure they know we mean busi-
ness.’’; 
Whereas on April 19, 2021, the judge in the 
trial of Derek Chauvin, Judge Peter Cahill, 
said in reply to Derek Chauvin’s defense at-
torney, ‘‘I’ll give you that Congresswoman 
Waters may have given you something on ap-
peal that may result in this whole trial being 
overturned.’’; 
Whereas Judge Cahill stated, ‘‘I wish elect-
ed officials would stop talking about this 
case, especially in a manner that is dis-
respectful to the rule of law and to the judi-
cial branch and our function.’’; and 
Whereas Judge Cahill stated, ‘‘I think if 
they want to give their opinions, they should 
do so in a respectful manner, and in a man-
ner that is consistent with their oath to the 
Constitution. To respect the coequal branch 
of government. Their failure to do so I think 
is abhorrent.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) Representative Maxine M. Waters of 
California be censured; 
(2) Representative Maxine M. Waters forth-
with present herself in the well of the House 
for the pronouncement of censure; and 
(3) Representative Maxine M. Waters be 
censured with the public reading of this reso-
lution by the Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Hoyer moves that the resolution be 
laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to table. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1985 
April 20, 2021 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The stated goal of the United States 
International 
Strategy 
for 
Cyberspace, 
launched on May 16, 2011, is to ‘‘work inter-
nationally to promote an open, interoper-
able, secure, and reliable information and 
communications infrastructure that sup-
ports international trade and commerce, 
strengthens international security, and fos-
ters free expression and innovation . . . in 
which norms of responsible behavior guide 
states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and 
support the rule of law in cyberspace’’. 
(2) In its June 24, 2013, report, the Group of 
Governmental Experts on Developments in 
the Field of Information and Telecommuni-
cations in the Context of International Secu-
rity (referred to in this section as ‘‘GGE’’), 
established by the United Nations General 
Assembly, 
concluded 
that 
‘‘State 
sov-
ereignty and the international norms and 
principles that flow from it apply to States’ 
conduct of [information and communications 
technology] ICT-related activities and to 
their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure 
with their territory’’. 
(3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbek-
istan proposed a troubling international code 
of conduct for information security, which 
could be used as a pretext for restricting po-
litical dissent, and includes ‘‘curbing the dis-
semination of information that incites ter-
rorism, separatism or extremism or that in-
flames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious 
grounds’’. 
(4) In its July 22, 2015, consensus report, 
GGE found that ‘‘norms of responsible State 
behavior can reduce risks to international 
peace, security and stability’’. 
(5) On September 25, 2015, the United 
States and China announced a commitment 
that neither country’s government ‘‘will 
conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled 
theft of intellectual property, including 
trade secrets or other confidential business 
information, with the intent of providing 
competitive advantages to companies or 
commercial sectors’’. 
(6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 
and 16, 2015, the Group of 20 Leaders’ 
communique´— 
(A) affirmed the applicability of inter-
national law to state behavior in cyberspace; 
(B) called on states to refrain from cyber- 
enabled theft of intellectual property for 
commercial gain; and 
(C) endorsed the view that all states should 
abide by norms of responsible behavior. 
(7) The March 2016 Department of State 
International Cyberspace Policy Strategy 
noted that ‘‘the Department of State antici-
pates a continued increase and expansion of 
our cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the 
foreseeable future’’. 
(8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on 
Enhancing National Cybersecurity, which 
was established within the Department of 
Commerce by Executive Order 13718 (81 Fed. 
Reg. 7441), recommended that ‘‘the President 
should appoint an Ambassador for Cyberse-
curity to lead U.S. engagement with the 
international community on cybersecurity 
strategies, standards, and practices’’. 
(9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 
Declaration on Responsible States Behavior 
in Cyberspace— 
(A) recognized ‘‘the urgent necessity of in-
creased international cooperation to pro-
mote security and stability in cyberspace’’; 
(B) expressed commitment to ‘‘promoting 
a strategic framework for conflict preven-
tion, cooperation and stability in cyber-
space, consisting of the recognition of the 
applicability of existing international law to 
State behavior in cyberspace, the promotion 
of voluntary, non-binding norms of respon-
sible State behavior during peacetime, and 
the development and the implementation of 
practical cyber confidence building measures 
(CBMs) between States’’; and 
(C) reaffirmed that ‘‘the same rights that 
people have offline must also be protected 
online’’. 
(10) In testimony before the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the Senate on May 
11, 2017, Director of National Intelligence 
Daniel R. Coats identified six cyber threat 
actors, including— 
(A) Russia, for ‘‘efforts to influence the 
2016 U.S. election’’; 
(B) China, for ‘‘actively targeting the U.S. 
Government, its allies, and U.S. companies 
for cyber espionage’’; 
(C) Iran, for ‘‘leverag[ing] cyber espionage, 
propaganda, and attacks to support its secu-
rity priorities, influence events and foreign 
perceptions, and counter threats’’; 
(D) 
North 
Korea, 
for 
‘‘previously 
conduct[ing] 
cyber-attacks 
against 
U.S. 
commercial entities—specifically, Sony Pic-
tures Entertainment in 2014’’; 
(E) terrorists, who ‘‘use the Internet to or-
ganize, recruit, spread propaganda, raise 
funds, collect intelligence, inspire action by 
followers, and coordinate operations’’; and 
(F) criminals, who ‘‘are also developing 
and using sophisticated cyber tools for a va-
riety of purposes including theft, extortion, 
and facilitation of other criminal activi-
ties’’. 
(11) On May 11, 2017, President Donald J. 
Trump issued Executive Order 13800 (82 Fed. 
Reg. 22391), entitled ‘‘Strengthening the Cy-
bersecurity of Federal Networks and Infra-
structure’’, which— 
(A) designates the Secretary of State to 
lead an interagency effort to develop an en-
gagement strategy for international co-
operation in cybersecurity; and 
(B) notes that ‘‘the United States is espe-
cially dependent on a globally secure and re-
silient internet and must work with allies 
and other partners toward maintaining . . . 
the policy of the executive branch to pro-
mote an open, interoperable, reliable, and se-
cure internet that fosters efficiency, innova-
tion, communication, and economic pros-
perity, while respecting privacy and guard-
ing against disruption, fraud, and theft’’.

IMPROVING FHA SUPPORT FOR SMALL-DOLLAR 
MORTGAGES ACT OF 2021 
H.R. 1532 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving 
FHA Support for Small-Dollar Mortgages 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORT-
GAGE PRACTICES. 
(a) CONGRESSIONAL
FINDINGS.—The Con-
gress finds that— 
(1) affordable homeownership opportunities 
are being hindered due to the lack of financ-
ing available for home purchases under 
$70,000; 
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small- 
dollar mortgage loan applications in 2017 
were denied by lenders at double the rate of 
denial for large mortgage loans, and this dif-
ference in denial rates cannot be fully ex-
plained by differences in the applicants’ 
credit profiles; 
(3) according to data compiled by Attom 
Data solutions, small-dollar mortgage origi-
nations have decreased 38 percent since 2009, 
while there has been a 65-percent increase in 
origination of mortgages for more than 
$150,000; 
(4) the FHA’s mission is to serve credit-
worthy borrowers who are underserved and, 
according to the Urban Institute, the FHA 
serves 24 percent of the overall market, but 
only 19 percent of the small-dollar mortgage 
market; and 
(5) the causes behind these variations are 
not fully understood, but merit study that 
could assist in furthering the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s mission, 
including meeting the housing needs of bor-
rowers the program is designed to serve and 
reducing barriers to homeownership, while 
protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mort-
gage Insurance Fund. 
(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development shall conduct a review of 
its FHA single-family mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products to identify 
any barriers or impediments to supporting, 
facilitating, and making available mortgage 
insurance for mortgages having an original 
principal obligation of $70,000 or less. Not 
later than the expiration of the 12-month pe-
riod beginning on the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a re-
port to the Congress describing the findings 
of such review and the actions that the Sec-
retary will take, without adversely affecting 
the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insur-
ance Fund, to remove such barriers and im-
pediments to providing mortgage insurance 
for such mortgages.

AND
THEIR 
DEMOCRATIC
ASPIRATIONS
AND
CONDEMNING 
ELECTION RIGGING AND SUBSEQUENT VIOLENT 
CRACKDOWNS ON PEACEFUL PROTESTERS 
H. RES. 124 
Whereas the Republic of Belarus held a 
presidential election on August 9, 2020, that 
was neither free nor fair; 
Whereas the presidential election took 
place without appropriate observation from 
local independent groups and international 
delegations; 
Whereas since the presidential election, 
Belarusians have demonstrated their strong 
desire and commitment to a democratic fu-
ture by organizing peaceful protests in 
Minsk and across the country; 
Whereas Belarusian civil society, led by 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has called for 
the resignation of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, 
the peaceful transition of power, the organi-
zation of new, free, and fair elections and the 
release of all political prisoners; 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leaders 
have faced intimidation, harassment, and de-
tention, including direct threats leading to 
the 
forced 
exile 
of 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya in Lithuania as well as the 
kidnapping 
and 
imprisonment 
of 
Maria 
Kalesnikava and other opposition leaders; 
Whereas in the months since the election, 
Belarusian authorities have arbitrarily de-
tained and brutally assaulted tens of thou-
sands of peaceful protesters, journalists, and 
opposition figures, of which hundreds remain 
in detention; 
Whereas human rights groups have docu-
mented hundreds of horrific accounts of tor-
ture, including sexual violence and rape, 
along with other instances ill-treatment and 
excessive force used against detainees ar-
rested for peaceful protest; 
Whereas on August 13 and 14, 2020, relatives 
of 
detainees 
held 
in 
the 
infamous 
‘‘Akrestsina’’ detention facility in Minsk re-
corded the sounds of ‘‘incessant beatings 
which were clearly audible in the street, and 
numerous voices screaming out in agony 
with some begging for mercy’’; 
Whereas thousands of Belarusians have 
fled to neighboring countries seeking polit-
ical asylum; 
Whereas independent journalists and the 
free media have faced intimidation, violence, 
mass arrests and prosecution, with many for-
eign journalists being stripped of their ac-
creditation; 
Whereas Katsyaryna Andreyeva and Darya 
Chultsovatwo, two journalists who work for 
Belsat, an independent Polish-based satellite 
television station aimed at Belarus, have 
each been sentenced to two years in prison 
simply for reporting live from a rally in 
Minsk in November 2020; 
Whereas Ihar Losik, a popular Belarusian 
blogger on Telegram, went on a hunger 
strike for 6 weeks to protest the politically- 
motivated charges that he helped organize 
riots after the fraudulent presidential elec-
tion; 
Whereas member states of the Organiza-
tion for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE), of which the United States and 
Belarus are members, invoked paragraph 12 
of the 1991 Moscow Document of the Con-
ference on the Human Dimension of the 
OSCE (Moscow Mechanism) to establish a 
mission of experts to review allegations of 
human rights violations; 
Whereas the OSCE Rapporteur’s Report 
under the Moscow Mechanism on Alleged 
Human Rights Violations related to the pres-
idential elections of August 9, 2020, in 
Belarus, published November 5, 2020, con-
cluded that there was ‘‘overwhelming evi-
dence that the presidential elections of 9 Au-
gust 2020 [had] been falsified and that mas-
sive and systematic human rights violations 
[had] been committed by the Belarusian se-
curity forces in response to peaceful dem-
onstrations and protests’’; 
Whereas women have played a leading role 
in peaceful demonstrations across the coun-
try, protesting the police brutality and mass 
detentions by wearing red and white, car-
rying 
flowers, 
and 
forming 
‘‘solidarity 
chains’’; 
Whereas the information technology (IT) 
industry in Belarus has played a prominent 
role in the democratic movement by de-
manding an end to violent oppression, as 
well as creating safe platforms for dem-
onstrators to communicate and track people 
who have been detained or went missing dur-
ing mass detentions;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1993 
April 20, 2021 
Whereas Belarusian authorities have con-
tinually disrupted internet channels in an 
attempt to limit communication among 
demonstrators and targeted lead technology 
companies and their employees advocating 
for democracy; 
Whereas Belarusian state-owned television 
channels have encouraged violence against 
peaceful demonstrators; 
Whereas a recent survey of IT specialists 
found that 15 percent of IT specialists work-
ing in Belarus have already relocated to 
neighboring countries, and over 40 percent of 
IT specialists no longer want to work in 
Belarus, resulting in a devastating loss of 
talent for Belarus, possibly permanently 
damaging the Belarusian technology indus-
try along with the Belarusian economy; 
Whereas hundreds of former law enforce-
ment officers in Belarus who have defected 
in defiance of illegal orders to commit 
human rights violations and cover up crimes 
against civilians and those who have assisted 
law enforcement officers in defecting have 
faced harassment, financial penalties, arrest, 
detention, and other punitive measures; 
Whereas several peaceful demonstrators 
have died as a result of police violence, in-
cluding 31-year-old Roman Bondrenko who 
was violently beaten by plainclothes police 
officers and, as a result, suffered head inju-
ries that resulted in his death; 
Whereas Belarusian universities continue 
to expel students and dismiss educators and 
researchers for participating in peaceful pro-
tests; 
Whereas child protective services have 
threatened multiple civic activists with ter-
mination of parental rights for bringing 
minor children to peaceful protests; 
Whereas factory workers at state-owned 
enterprises have been continuously harassed 
for trying to organize independent trade 
unions and have been forced to sign political 
letters opposing sanctions by the European 
Union under threat of termination of their 
employment; 
Whereas a transatlantic community of leg-
islators has emerged in support of uplifting 
the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian 
people; 
Whereas international advocacy, including 
by co-host Latvia, succeeded in preventing 
the illegitimate Government of Belarus from 
hosting the 2021 Ice Hockey World Cham-
pionship; 
Whereas the United States, the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada 
have enacted sanctions and other punitive 
measures against dozens of individuals and 
entities found responsible for the perpetra-
tion of violence against peaceful demonstra-
tors, opposition members, and journalists, 
among others; 
Whereas 
Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka 
con-
tinues to undermine the sovereignty and 
independence of Belarus through efforts to 
integrate Belarus into a so-called ‘‘Union 
States’’ under the control of Russia; 
Whereas the House of Representatives 
passed 
the 
Belarus 
Democracy, 
Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020 with 
unanimous consent, sending a clear message 
of overwhelming, bipartisan support for the 
democratic movement in Belarus; 
Whereas the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020 was 
signed into law via the fiscal year 2021 omni-
bus spending bill, expanding the President’s 
authority to impose sanctions related to 
Belarus, including on Russian individuals 
who have undermined Belarus’ sovereignty, 
as well as authorizing increased assistance 
to counter internet censorship and surveil-
lance technology, support women advocating 
for freedom and human rights, and support 
political refugees fleeing the crackdown in 
Belarus, among other things; and 
Whereas the Belarusian opposition, led by 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, organized a Day 
of Solidary on February 7, 2020, where coun-
tries, cities, and political and elected lead-
ers, as well as everyday citizens around the 
world demonstrated their support for the six 
months of historic peaceful protests since 
the fraudulent presidential election that 
took place on August 9, 2020: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) finds that the August 9, 2020, presi-
dential election in Belarus was neither free 
nor fair and, therefore, does not recognize 
the 
government-announced 
results 
or 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka as the legitimate 
President of Belarus; 
(2) calls for new free and fair elections 
under Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe observation; 
(3) affirms that the people of Belarus have 
the right to determine the future of Belarus 
without unwelcome intervention from the 
Russian Federation or any outside actors in 
violation of Belarusian independence and 
sovereignty; 
(4) condemns the human rights violations 
committed by Belarusian authorities, in-
cluding against peaceful demonstrators, civil

dents, educators, employees at state-owned 
enterprises, medical personnel, and journal-
ists, and calls for such authorities to halt 
any further acts of violence against civil-
ians; 
(5) calls for the immediate release of all 
political prisoners and those unlawfully de-
tained in connection with the peaceful dem-
onstrations including independent journal-
ists and family members of United States

(6) recognizes the sacrifices and bravery of 
the Belarusian people and the incredible or-
ganization by Belarusian women to peace-
fully demand a free and fair democratic proc-
ess while enduring the state-sponsored vio-
lence that followed the August 9, 2020, elec-
tion; 
(7) calls on Alyaksandr Lukashenka and 
Belarusian authorities to engage in an open 
and constructive dialogue with the opposi-
tion members and other stakeholders to 
bring about a peaceful transition of power; 
(8) calls for the protection of civil society 
actors 
and 
members 
of 
the 
opposition 
against arbitrary arrest and violence while 
conducting peaceful discussions relating to 
the peaceful transition of power in Belarus; 
(9) recognizes the Coordination Council es-
tablished by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as a 
legitimate institution to participate in a 
dialogue on a peaceful transition of power; 
(10) urges continued cooperation among 
the United States and its transatlantic allies 
and partners to explore avenues in support of 
the democratic movement in Belarus; 
(11) calls for further targeted sanctions co-
ordinated between the United States, the Eu-
ropean Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, 
and 
other 
allies 
and 
partners 
against 
Belarusian 
authorities 
who 
committed 
human rights violations and engaged in ac-
tivities that resulted in the falsification of 
the August 9, 2020, election results; 
(12) encourages when considering, in co-
ordination with transatlantic partners, the 
sanctioning of Belarusian state-owned com-
panies that have directly violated the rights 
of their workers as a result of their partici-
pation in or in connection to the ongoing 
democratic movement in Belarus that the 
Administration take into consideration the 
potential implications of making these com-
panies more vulnerable to takeovers by Rus-
sian or Chinese state-owned companies; 
(13) calls on the transatlantic community 
to review and consider reassessing any finan-
cial 
assistance 
that 
supports 
the 
Lukashenka regime, including participation 
in state debt issuances or procurement con-
tracts; 
(14) supports increasing funds available for 
foreign assistance to Belarusian civil society 
groups as well as legal assistance for activ-
ists and independent journalists, among oth-
ers, as called for in the Belarus Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020; 
(15) urges the President to provide the 
United States Agency for Global Media with 
a surge capacity (as such term is defined in 
section 316 of the United States Inter-
national Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 
6216)) for programs and activities in Belarus, 
including to protect the brave independent 
journalists reporting from within Belarus as 
called for in the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020; 
(16) calls for an international investigation 
into the human rights abuses committed 
during and after the August 9, 2020, presi-
dential election; and 
(17) continues to support the aspirations of 
the people of Belarus for democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law, and reaffirms 
that the fulfillment of such aspirations is 
critical to ensuring the continued strength 
of Belarusian sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CRAIG). Pursuant to section 6 of House 
Resolution 330, the ordering of the yeas 
and nays on postponed motions to sus-
pend the rules with respect to such

HOYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bills and the resolu-
tion. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I

VICTIMS 
OF 
THE 
SHOOTING IN BOULDER, COLO-

Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with my colleagues from the State of 
Colorado to honor the 10 precious lives 
lost at the King Soopers grocery store 
in my congressional district in Boul-
der, Colorado, on March 22nd. 
There are no words to express how 
the Boulder community is feeling in 
the wake of this tragedy. Our hearts 
are broken. The loss of life is truly 
heartbreaking and unimaginable. Ten 
lives taken too soon; daughters, sons, 
neighbors, spouses, coworkers, commu-
nity members, each of whom left a pro-
found impact on our community: Offi-
cer Eric Talley, Denny, Neven, Rikki, 
Tralona, Suzanne, Teri, Kevin, Lynn, 
and Jody. Today, may we remember 
them and honor them as we lift their 
names and express our deepest condo-
lences to their families. 
I hope everyone in the House will 
now join me for a moment of silence. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
those present in the Chamber as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol to please rise for a moment of si-
lence.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
REMEMBERING WALTER FREDERICK MONDALE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night, the country lost a giant of 
Democratic politics, a kind and revered 
public servant, a Vice President who 
reimagined the position and expanded 
Americans’ views of who could hold 
America’s highest offices. Walter Mon-
dale, known to friends and foes alike as 
‘‘Fritz,’’ died at the age of 93. 
As 
President 
Carter’s 
right-hand 
man, Fritz revolutionized the role of 
the Vice Presidency. There is an old 
yarn about two brothers: One went off 
to sea, and the other became Vice 
President. Neither was heard from 
again. That is not true of Walter Mon-
dale. 
Walter Mondale was an uncoopera-
tive subject for those Vice Presidential 
comedians. Not only was he often the 
last person in the room with the Presi-
dent when the tough decisions were 
made, but he became an unofficial am-
bassador for the administration. His re-
lationship with Prime Minister Begin 
of Israel helped paved the way for a 
peace treaty between Israel and Egypt 
at Camp David in 1978. 
In his ultimately unsuccessful run 
for the Presidency, Walter Mondale’s 
pick of my fellow New Yorker, the late 
Geraldine Ferraro, as Vice President 
was an early crack in the glass ceiling 
that 
our 
current 
Vice 
President, 
KAMALA
HARRIS, 
would 
eventually 
shatter. 
Vice President Mondale will be re-
membered as a lion of progressive poli-
tics; an ardent defender of civil rights, 
aid 
to 
schoolchildren, 
childcare, 
healthcare, and consumer protections. 
Mondale once said: 
My whole life I worked on the idea that 
government can be an instrument for social 
progress. We need that progress. Fairness re-
quires it. 
Indeed, as Mondale said, we need gov-
ernment to make social progress. 
As we say goodbye to one of our 
country’s most decent public servants, 
let us follow in his example. 
MARIJUANA 
Mr. President, now on a much dif-
ferent subject, today is what you might 
call a very unofficial American holi-
day, 4/20. It is as appropriate a time as 
any to take a hard look at our laws 
that have overcriminalized the use of 
marijuana and put it on a par with her-
oin, LSD, and other narcotics that bear 
little or no resemblance in their effects

S2044 
April 20, 2021 
either on individuals or on society, 
more broadly. 
The war on drugs has too often been 
a war on people, particularly people of 
color. For decades, young men and 
women—disproportionately, 
young 
men and women of color—have been ar-
rested and jailed for even carrying a 
small amount of marijuana, a charge 
that often came with exorbitant pen-
alties and a serious criminal record 
from which they might never recover, 
being rejected from job after job be-
cause this minor, minor deviation from 
the law was listed as a serious criminal 
record. 
It makes no sense. It is time for 
change. I believe the time has come to 
end the Federal prohibition on mari-
juana in this country, and I am work-
ing with Senators BOOKER and WYDEN 
on legislation to do just that. My 
thinking on this issue has evolved. 
A number of States—including, very 
recently, my home State of New 
York—have legalized the recreational 
use of marijuana for adults, and those 
experiments, by and large, have been a 
success. 
The 
doom-and-gloom 
pre-
dictions, when States like Colorado or 
Oregon went forward and decriminal-
ized and legalized marijuana, never oc-
curred. 
In State after State, through ballot 
initiatives and constitutional amend-
ments, the American people are send-
ing a clear message that they want this 
policy 
changed. 
Senators 
BOOKER, 
WYDEN, and I are going to continue to 
work on our legislation, and in the 
near future, we hope to have a draft of 
a comprehensive reform effort, not 
only to end the Federal prohibition on 
marijuana but to ensure restorative 
justice, protect public health, and im-
plement responsible taxes and regula-
tions. This was the approach taken by 
legislators in New York. I believe it is 
the right approach, and it serves as a 
model for how we should deal with the 
issue in Congress. 
Hopefully, the next time this unoffi-
cial holiday, 4/20, rolls around, our 
country will have made progress in ad-
dressing the massive overcriminaliza-
tion of marijuana in a meaningful and 
comprehensive way. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, now on voting rights, 
today in the Judiciary Committee, 
Senators will hear testimony from a 
number of public officials and experts 
about the surge in voter suppression 
laws since the 2020 election, including 
former 
Georgia 
gubernatorial 
can-
didate Stacey Abrams. 
These voter suppression laws—more 
than 250 proposed laws in more than 40 
States—constitute a grave and imme-
diate threat to the very core of our de-
mocracy. In ways both large and small, 
they seek to restrict the franchise, 
often targeting minority communities, 
younger voters, and dense urban dis-
tricts. 
Our Republican colleagues have tried 
in vain to defend these laws as mean-
ingful 
and 
appropriate 
protections 
against voter fraud. In many cases, 
those attempts have been just laugh-
able. 
Just to take one example from ear-
lier this week, the Republican-led Mon-
tana State Legislature passed a law 
that ends election-day voter registra-
tion and would no longer allow student 
IDs to be used as a sole ballot form of 
identification. Just think about that 
for a moment. What problems are the 
Republicans in Montana trying to solve 
there? Has there been a rash of 40-year- 
olds showing up with student IDs to 
commit voter fraud? No, there cer-
tainly hasn’t been. We all know what is 
going on here. Younger voters have 
been shown to be more Democratic. So 
Montana Republicans have made it 
harder for them to vote. It is des-
picable—just 
despicable—and 
these 
laws are moving through State legisla-
tures all across the country, including 
the most recent one in Georgia, which, 
among other crucial reforms, makes it 
a crime—a crime—to provide food and 
water to voters waiting in line at the 
poles, even though in minority areas 
the lines are often much longer because 
there are fewer polling places. 
I know my Democratic colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee are going to 
shine a spotlight on all of these efforts, 
and I applaud Chairman DURBIN for 
holding this very important hearing 
today. Voting rights are a topic that 
deserves continued national attention. 
It is a top priority for this Democratic 
Senate majority. 
PUERTO RICO 
Finally, Mr. President, you couldn’t 
find a better study in contrasts than 
the Trump administration and the 
Biden administration. On so many 
issues, the executive branch is finally 
returning to competence, undoing the 
damage wrought by 4 years of Trump’s 
Presidency. 
One important example came last 
night. Beginning in 2017, the Trump ad-
ministration maliciously held back bil-
lions of dollars in congressionally ap-
proved disaster aid to Puerto Rico, 
which was devastated by Hurricane 
Maria, resulting in the deaths of thou-
sands of Americans. This was vicious 
on the part of Donald Trump—nasty, so 
typical of the pettiness and inhu-
manity of his administration. 
Well, the Biden administration has 
finally ended this appalling delay and 
will release the much needed disaster 
relief funds that Puerto Rico has wait-
ed for, for almost 5 years. The release 
of these funds means the people of 
Puerto Rico can finally and fully re-
build their homes, their schools, their 
businesses. 
Puerto Rico, unfortunately, has too 
often been an afterthought to work 
here in Washington. Funds that would 
normally go to any State after a nat-
ural disaster like Hurricane Maria got 
delayed for years over the course of an 
entire administration. 
Puerto Ricans are American citizens 
and should be treated exactly as such 
when disaster strikes. That is why, in 
the American Rescue Plan, Democrats 
passed the largest, most comprehensive 
relief package for the people of Puerto 
Rico in a long, long time. I am proud to 
have worked with my House col-
leagues, 
particularly 
Representative 
NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, to get that done. 
Prior to the American Rescue Plan, 
the Federal Government had never sup-
ported Puerto Rico’s tax credit for low- 
income workers. We did that for the 
first time ever. 
Shockingly, prior to the American 
Rescue Plan, only families with three 
or more children in Puerto Rico could 
claim the child tax credit. That seems, 
to me, to be racist in its application. 
We fixed that and made sure that every 
family in Puerto Rico can claim the 
credit, just like every other American 
family. 
So as long as Democrats have a ma-
jority here in the Senate, I am going to 
make sure that Puerto Rico is treated 
fairly and gets its fair share of support. 
When it comes to this disaster aid, I 
am so glad the Biden administration is 
rectifying the issue. I hope we never re-
peat such a shameful delay. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
situation on our southern border is bad 
and getting worse. Last month saw 
overall migrant totals hit a nearly 
two-decade high. More unaccompanied 
minors arrived than during any prior 
month on record. 
These kids, crowded in underequipped 
facilities, tended by increasingly over-
whelmed personnel, have become the 
heart-wrenching face of this crisis. Yet 
the most resolve, the most strength 
that this administration has shown on 
the border has been their commitment 
to their talking points, their refusal to 
call the crisis a crisis. 
This past weekend, the President of 
the United States himself slipped up 
and used that forbidden word. But—get 
this—he was then overruled by his own 
staff. Yesterday, his Press Secretary 
said President Biden actually didn’t in-
tend to describe the situation as a cri-
sis. Fascinating. 
But then, yesterday, at last, we saw 
this administration take some new ac-
tion on immigration. Finally, some 
proactive steps. Memos were issued to 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
and CBP with new instruction. Were 
they new policies to stem the crisis? 
No. Stepped-up enforcement? No. A 
way to fix the administration’s signals 
that have induced these new waves of

vulnerable people to try their luck? No, 
not this either. 
Here was the big news: The govern-
ment will be adopting new, more politi-
cally correct rhetoric. Under this ad-
ministration, we will no longer have 
‘‘illegal aliens,’’ not because they will 
secure the border; just because they 
now will be called ‘‘noncitizens’’ or 
‘‘undocumented migrants’’ and so on. 
These priorities are almost a parody 
of leftwing governance: not securing 
the border, not a better plan for the 
children, just woke proofreading. This 
is not going to get the job done. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. President, on a related matter, of 
course, the flow of actual people is not 
our only border security problem. 
Americans are dying and communities 
are being hollowed out because foreign 
drug dealers and profiteers have taken 
our opioid crisis as a business oppor-
tunity. 
Fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl 
analogues 
that pour into our country impose a 
staggering, tragic loss. In 2020, the CDC 
recorded more overdose deaths than 
any year on record. They attributed 
the 
spike 
primarily 
to 
synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl. 
My home State of Kentucky logged a 
50-percent 
year-on-year 
increase 
in 
overdose deaths. Fentanyl and its con-
stantly changing analogues are as 
toxic and lethal an illegal drug as there 
is. We are talking about substances 
that can be orders of magnitude more 
potent than morphine. 
Customs and Border Protection say 
fentanyl seizures jumped more than 70 
percent in fiscal year 2020. They are on 
pace for another record year in 2021. 
Much of this poison is manufactured in 
and exported from China. 
The scope of this crisis is truly stag-
gering. But incredibly, some on the po-
litical left want to respond to this na-
tional crisis by letting the criminal 
status of fentanyl analogues lapse this 
spring. 
People want to let these drugs be-
come legal. They actually want to let 
these drugs become legal. I am not 
making this up. Fentanyl analogues 
are poised to fall off the schedule of 
controlled substances in just a few 
weeks if Congress does not act, and 
some corners of the soft-on-crime left 
want us to do nothing. They are un-
happy with the sentences that be can 
be imposed on drug dealers as a result. 
These people are seriously arguing— 
seriously arguing that we should let 
these substances flow even more freely 
through American streets and Amer-
ican neighborhoods, costing who knows 
how many additional American lives to 
help some drug dealer avoid prison. 
I understand that even among Demo-
crats who say they don’t want to de-
criminalize these poisons, there is 
some effort to kick the can a few 
months with a temporary extension so 
that a soft-on-crime bill could be craft-
ed and forcibly paired with this step. 
Look, these are terrible ideas, just 
terrible ideas. The right thing to do is 
obvious. This isn’t a trick question. We 
need to permanently schedule fentanyl 
analogues, take this permanent step to 
protect Americans, and be done with it. 
We should not just kick the can down 
the road for 2 months or 5 months or 12 
months. We should not let this com-
monsense step be held hostage for lib-
eral horse trading. We simply need to 
do the right thing. 
Congress cannot hold American lives 
and communities hostage to try to 
grease the skids for drug dealers. Con-
tinuing to ban these analogues is not 
even a recipe for mass incarceration. 
The main effect is to cut down on the 
incoming supply of these poisons by 
changing the incentives for producers 
in China and other foreign countries. 
The Department of Justice reports 
that, in the last 3 years, only 8 people— 
8 people would have qualified for the 
mandatory minimum sentences that 
some people are complaining about. 
More than anything else, scheduling 
these terrible drugs is a harm reduc-
tion and prevention tool. It works up-
stream. It disincentivizes their manu-
facture and their import into our coun-
try. 
Too many of our neighbors have al-
ready been taken from us. Too many 
communities 
have 
already 
been 
hollowed out. There is simply no ex-
cuse for inaction. 
It should not just be a Republican 
priority to slam the door on the opioid 
epidemic in every possible way. This 
should actually be a bipartisan no- 
brainer. Let’s permanently schedule 
these analogues and keep this poison 
out of our land and out of our citizens’ 
bloodstreams. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, now, on one final mat-
ter, this afternoon, President Biden is 
sending his top national security offi-
cials to brief Members on his mis-
guided plan to abandon the battlefield 
in Afghanistan. 
As I said when this decision was an-
nounced, the enemies that threaten 
America, our allies, and the people of 
Afghanistan 
are 
not 
vanquished. 
Taliban retribution and repression and 
the terror of al-Qaida, ISIS, and the 
Haqqani Network will likely only grow 
after we have left. 
I know many colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle share my concerns. I expect 
that the administration’s representa-
tives will face tough questions about 
the rationale behind their plan for a 
rushed withdrawal. 
So it is appropriate to ask: Does the 
Taliban 
share 
the 
administration’s 
commitment to a negotiated solution, 
to not harming Afghan women or girls 
or seeking vengeance on those who 
have worked with the United States to 
root out terror? Somehow I doubt it. 
Does the administration have a plan 
for keeping terrorists off-balance in 
the absence of troops and leverage in 
the region? Will it seek to maintain 
the 2001 AUMF, which authorizes the 
ongoing counterterrorism operations 
that have actually kept our homeland 
safe for 20 years? 
How does the administration plan to 
maintain our insight into terrorist ac-
tivities or our ability to strike them 
without a presence on the ground, to 
sustain our partners who are doing the 
fighting? I worked hard to find com-
mon ground with this administration 
on foreign policy, but if the White 
House is serious about making Amer-
ica, our allies, and our interests more 
secure, it will need to start tacking to-
ward a more enduring approach cen-
tered on strength, grounded in reality 
and not wishful thinking. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEM-
PORE. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing the order of yesterday, the 
Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 
p.m. and that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate 
proceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the Gensler nomina-
tion and the Senate vote on the motion 
to invoke cloture on the nomination; 
that following the cloture vote, the 
Senate resume legislative session and 
the Senate recess until 4 p.m. to allow 
for the all-Senators briefing; further, 
that if cloture is invoked on the 
Gensler nomination, all postcloture 
time be considered expired at 5 p.m.; 
that immediately following the dis-
position of the Gensler nomination, the 
Senate resume consideration of the 
Monaco nomination and vote on con-
firmation as provided under the pre-
vious order; that if either nomination 
is confirmed, the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action; finally, 
that following the confirmation vote 
on the Monaco nomination, the Senate 
resume legislative session. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEM-
PORE. Without objection, it is so or-

should expect one rollcall vote at 2:15 
p.m. and two rollcall votes at 5 p.m.

The Republican whip. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last fall, 
there was a concern among many 
around the country, many Republican 
voters, that if elected—Democrats in 
the House, the Senate, and the White 
House—if they had the whole of gov-
ernment, they would try to implement 
massive 
change, 
transformative 
change, as it was described. There was 
a consistent view articulated by Demo-
crats in other places around the coun-
try that it would never happen because 
Joe Biden, after all, is a moderate. 
These ideas are crazy ideas. Nobody 
would ever do some of the things that 
are being talked about. 
Well, I have to say that pretty much 
everything that was predicted is now 
coming true, at least as it pertains to 
legislation that is being advanced by 
Democrats here in the Congress and by 
the White House, starting, of course, 
with the massive amount of spending, 
the massive expansion of the govern-
ment. 
We saw that with the coronavirus re-
lief bill, which ended up being about $2 
trillion. That was on top of the $4 tril-
lion that Congress, in a bipartisan way 
last year, had put toward coronavirus 
relief. Much of that $2 trillion—in fact, 
most of it, about 90 percent of it— 
didn’t 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
coronavirus. Only about 10 percent of 
all that spending of nearly $2 trillion 
was 
actually 
related 
to 
the 
coronavirus. Most of it was other 
things that Democrats had wanted to 
fund, that had been on their wish list, 
if you will, for some time, and expan-
sion of government. 
Well, if that weren’t enough, there is 
now talk of an ‘‘infrastructure’’ bill 
that would spend on the order of an-
other $2.5 to $3 trillion—again, much of 
which is unrelated to infrastructure. If 
you define ‘‘infrastructure’’ simply as 
roads and bridges, things that most 
people think of as infrastructure, the 
number that has been used is 6 percent 
of that entire bill is about infrastruc-
ture. If you add in broadband and a few 
other things, it gets slightly higher 
than that. 
The point is that most of the spend-
ing in this bill is unrelated to infra-
structure. It is another $2.5 to $3 tril-
lion expansion of government, new 
spending financed—some with tax in-
creases but a lot of it just adding to 
the debt, just putting it on the credit 
card and handing the bill to our chil-
dren 
and 
grandchildren, 
something 
that has been routinely done around 
here for a long time. 
Mr. President, what I think people 
should find concerning is that the 
worst fears predicted about what the 
left might do if in charge of this coun-
try are, in fact, coming true. Much of 
this new spending—by the way, the in-
frastructure bill is a first installment. 
There is another bill to follow, we are 
told, that would include more trillions 
in spending, dealing with other issues, 
including healthcare. 
You have this massive expansion of 
government, massive amount of new 
spending, unprecedented, truly unprec-
edented in history, coupled with mas-
sive tax hikes, also unprecedented. 
What is being talked about just in the 
first infrastructure bill is over $1 tril-
lion in new taxes. The taxing, spend-
ing, borrowing patterns that we pre-
dicted would happen are, in fact, com-
ing true. Add to that other things that 
were suggested and proposed through-
out the fall and the course of the cam-
paigns. 
Subsequent to that included adding 
DC as a State. So adding DC as a State 
is going to pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. I am not sure if they are 
voting on it today, but it has either 
been voted on or will be voted on. It 
will pass the House of Representatives. 
That is a very, very serious, serious 
proposal which dramatically changes 
the U.S. Senate and, I believe, what the 
Founders intended with respect to the 
District of Columbia. 
Then you add to it legislation that 
has already passed the House and is 
being contemplated being passed here 
in the Senate that would federalize 
elections in this country, that would 
codify ballot harvesting, and that 
would ban voter ID, photo ID, which is 
something that, I think, most Ameri-
cans think is a very wise thing to do 
when it comes to election integrity, to 
make sure that the people who are vot-
ing actually are who they say they are. 
Voter ID is a pretty important part of 
that. It would have the taxpayers fi-
nance—publicly 
fund—campaigns 
in 
this country. I can’t imagine the Amer-
ican taxpayers, among all of the other 
things that they have to finance in the 
government, also want to finance the 
campaigns 
that 
they 
have 
to 
sit 
through. 
It would politicize the Federal Elec-
tion Commission, which, in the past, 
has been a balanced—three Republican, 
three Democrat—bipartisan committee 
that has overseen and regulated elec-
tions in this country. So it would po-
liticize it and give the Democrats an 
advantage, a partisan advantage, on 
the Federal Election Commission. 
All of those things are in this elec-
tions bill, which would transform—I 
mean, I am talking literally trans-
form—the way we do elections in this 
country, which historically and by way 
of the Constitution and the law have 
been handled and administered at the 
State level. States have been very in-
volved. 
What this would do is consolidate 
more power in Washington, DC, and 
pull the regulation of elections up to 
the Federal Government, coupled with 
all of the changes that I just men-
tioned. There is no way—absolutely no 
way—that even if passed they could be 
done, could be implemented, for the up-
coming 2022 election, which secretaries 
of state from across the country, in-
cluding 
Democratic 
secretaries 
of 
state, have indicated. 
So that is another thing that is on 
the liberal wish list that I mentioned: 
the federalizing of our elections—tak-
ing them away from the States where, 
historically, elections have been han-
dled and administered—and bringing 
them here, essentially nationalizing 
our elections. 
Then there is the Green New Deal. 
The Green New Deal is, I believe, being 
introduced again today by a number of 
Democratic Senators and House Mem-
bers—something, again, that would 
completely change the way we fuel our 
country in ways that would drive up 
dramatically the costs that an average 
consumer in this country and an aver-
age family would have to pay for en-
ergy. It would be done through man-
dates, regulations, and heavy-handed 
government requirements as opposed 
to incentivizing some of these things 
that, I think, we all agree we should be 
doing when it comes to cleaning up our 
environment. The Green New Deal is 
the opposite of that. The Green New 
Deal is a government, Washington, DC, 
mandate, requirement, heavy-handed 
regulatory approach to that issue and 
something that has struck fear in the 
hearts of literally tens of millions of 
Americans since it began being talked 
about only a few years ago. 
Those are just a handful on the list of 
what I would call horribles for which 
the left has been advocating for some 
time in this country. All of these 
things could be accomplished if the 
Democrats are able to follow through 
with another thing that they said they 
would never do and are now talking 
about and if they have the votes would 
do, and that is to do away with the leg-
islative filibuster, which is a feature of 
our democracy that goes back literally 
200 years to our Nation’s founding and 
has ensured through those years that 
the minority has a voice in our policy-
making process; that there is an oppor-
tunity for both sides to collaborate, 
compromise, and to ensure that there 
isn’t majoritarian rule. The Founders

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2047 
April 20, 2021 
were very firm about that idea. They 
thought there needed to be checks and 
balances against that, and the legisla-
tive filibuster has provided that for 200 
years. 
It is something that we refused to 
do—even though the Republicans were 
asked repeatedly during the last 4 
years of the Trump Presidency, by the 
President himself, to get rid of the leg-
islative filibuster—because we believe 
it is essential as a feature of our de-
mocracy and something that protects 
the minority in this country, the mi-
nority rights, the voice of the minor-
ity, in our policymaking process. It en-
sures that we get solutions that, ulti-
mately, are durable over time because 
they have been negotiated in a way 
that requires the input from both sides 
of the political equation. 
That is something that has been sa-
cred, so sacred, even despite the fact 
that President Trump, on 34 different 
occasions, asked the Republicans—or 
probably more; I would say ‘‘ask’’ 
would be a gentle word—and essen-
tially said that the Republicans in the 
Senate needed to get rid of the legisla-
tive filibuster. He either did that by 
tweet or by public statement. It was 
clearly something that he believed was 
a priority in order to implement his 
agenda. We resisted that. We resisted 
that even though we would have bene-
fited from it on numerous occasions 
when it came to moving legislation 
through the Senate. 
For the past 6 years, we had the ma-
jority, and for the past 4 years, we had 
the Presidency up until January of this 
year, and notwithstanding the constant 
barrage of suggestions—again, putting 
it mildly—to get rid of the legislative 
filibuster by a President from our own 
party, we resisted that simply because 
we believed the legislative filibuster is 
such an essential and critical part of 
our democracy. 
So here we go. The Democrats get 
elected. They have, on countless occa-
sions, told me privately—individual 
Senators on their side of the aisle— 
that there is no way. We would never 
do that. We will never get rid of the 
legislative filibuster. It is too impor-
tant. We are not going to do that. In 
fact, 33 Democrats signed a letter as re-
cently as 3 years ago, basically, essen-
tially ratifying their support for the 
legislative filibuster and, as to the sug-
gestion that it could possibly be done 
away with, suggesting that it would be 
a terrible, wrong thing to do for this 
country—essentially 
coming 
out 
strongly, strongly supporting the legis-
lative filibuster. These are 33 Demo-
cratic Senators here in the U.S. Senate 
coming out in support of the legislative 
filibuster. 
Now, the shoe is on the other foot. 
They are in the majority. They have 
been in the majority for about 2 
months, and they are already talking 
about it openly, and many have come 
out and endorsed the idea. Frankly, to 
be honest with you, I think it would 
have been done already had it not been 
for a couple of Democrats who, I think, 
are thoughtful enough, contemplative 
enough, and revering enough of our in-
stitutions in this country not to be run 
over by the majority on their side and 
do away with something that is just so 
critical and so important to our Na-
tion’s not only heritage and history 
but to our future. If it were not for 
that, I think it would have been done 
already. I think the Senator from New 
York, the Democratic leader, in a New 
York minute would get rid of the legis-
lative filibuster if he had the votes to 
do it, partly out of fear that he would 
be savaged by his ‘‘woke’’ left if he 
wouldn’t do it. 
Obviously, the President, President 
Biden, whom, as I mentioned earlier, 
many people thought would govern as a 
moderate and a unifier and as someone 
who fiercely defended the legislative 
filibuster as a U.S. Senator and made 
speeches on this very floor in defending 
fiercely the legislative filibuster, is 
now also talking about getting rid of it 
in order to implement massive tax 
hikes, massive spending increases, and 
a massive growth in government—an 
expansion of government unlike any-
thing we have seen in history, includ-
ing the 1930s, the New Deal. This would 
dwarf that by comparison. 
DC statehood, federalizing our elec-
tions, and passing the Green New Deal, 
all of that could be done with 51 votes 
if they could blow up and get rid of the 
legislative filibuster, and all of those 
are very real, not hypotheticals—real. 
These are things that have already 
passed or are going to pass the House 
of Representatives and are being con-
sidered here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate, including today when, I think, 
the Green New Deal is being reintro-
duced. These are legislative proposals 
that are so far out of the political 
mainstream in the things that they are 
contemplating that it is hard to be-
lieve. 
Just as an example of the impact 
that these tax increases could have, 
look at what the tax cuts that were 
passed—the reform act that was passed 
in 2017—were doing in terms of the 
economy and the benefits that they 
were having across all demographic 
sectors in this country. Up until the 
pandemic, we had the best economy 
probably in 50 years. We had the lowest 
unemployment rate, for sure. We had 
the biggest gain in income wage levels 
among particularly minority groups. 
In fact, this is census data from 2019 
that shows that the real median house-
hold income hit its highest level ever 
for African-American, Hispanic, and 
Asian-American workers and retirees. 
The 2019 poverty rate was the lowest in 
more than 50 years for children at 14.4 
percent, the lowest ever for individuals 
at 10.5 percent, for families at 8.5 per-
cent, and for households headed by un-
married women at 22.2 percent. More 
impressive is that, even after 10 years 
of economic expansion, the 2019 gains 
shattered all records as real household 
income leapt by $4,379 in 2019 alone, 13 
times the average annual gain since 
data were first collected. 
So the tax policies we had in place 
were working, and there have been 
record income gains, especially among 
lower income Americans. The poverty 
rate, as I mentioned, plummeted 11 per-
cent in 2019, the most in 53 years. 
Things were moving in the right direc-
tion. So the question is, If it isn’t 
broke, why fix it? Why would we go and 
increase taxes in a massive way at a 
time when the economy is growing and 
expanding and creating better paying 
jobs? 
What I would argue for those in any 
income group and across any ethnic 
group is that the best solution for im-
proving their standard of living and 
their quality of life is to have a grow-
ing, expanding economy that is throw-
ing off better paying jobs and higher 
wages. That is what raises the income 
level. That is what lifts the boat for 
every American, and that is what we 
ought to be looking for, not how much 
government can we pull back to Wash-
ington, DC, and how much government 
can do for you but how we can put the 
right policies in place that put the con-
ditions in place for economic growth 
that will stimulate the kind of invest-
ment that will create those good-pay-
ing jobs and start lifting wages across 
this country. 
It is about growth in our economy, I 
would argue. It is about good-paying 
jobs. It is about higher wages. That is 
what our arguments here ought to be 
about. Instead, right now, we are talk-
ing about growing government and in-
creasing taxes and reversing what, I 
would argue, is a lot of progress that I 
just mentioned, that being from the 
2019 U.S. Census Bureau’s data. 
Why would we go back on the great 
progress that has been made? Why 
would we start to contemplate some of 
these suggestions that I mentioned, 
from the tax hikes, the spending in-
creases, the federalizing of our elec-
tions, the Green New Deal, and repeal-
ing the filibuster which, again, would 
consolidate more control, more power, 
in the hands of a few people here rather 
than keeping it distributed? It would 
consolidate more and more power in 
Washington, DC. 
That kind of brings me to the topic 
for today that is on that list of 
horribles and things that would under-
mine the integrity of our political in-
stitutions in a way that these other 
things would as well but, I would say, 
on a much, much higher, much ex-
panded level, and that is packing the 
Supreme Court which, again, people 
thought was a hypothetical. That was 
one of those things to which people 
said: Now, those guys down there, 
those Democrats, are not that crazy. 
There are some moderate Democrats 
out there. There are some people who 
would stand up in the way of that and 
keep something that crazy from hap-
pening. 
Well, it didn’t take very long. It only 
took a week—just 1 week after Presi-
dent Biden established his Commission

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2048 
April 20, 2021 
to study Court packing, which is an-
other ostensible Supreme Court re-
form, for the Democratic Members of 
Congress in both Houses to introduce 
legislation that would actually pack 
the Court. This is no longer a hypo-
thetical. This is colleagues on this side 
of the aisle and the Democrats in the 
House of Representatives who are open-
ly advocating for packing the Supreme 
Court in the form of legislation and not 
just adding a couple of members but 
adding enough members to give them a 
majority, to give them a majority on 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Now, many people are probably won-
dering what the crisis was that precip-
itated this legislation, a crisis so grave 
that these Democrats couldn’t even 
wait for the results of the President’s 
stacked Commission. President Biden’s 
Commission, which is stacked with 
Democrats to give them the result that 
they want, is supposed to report back 
in the timeframe of, I believe, about 6 
months. They couldn’t even wait for 
that. They had to introduce a bill that 
would pack the Court. So why did they 
have to do that? Well, I will tell you. 
The crisis that requires us to imme-
diately add four additional Justices to 
the Supreme Court after 150 years of 
having the Court at its current size is 
that a duly elected Republican Presi-
dent was able to get three Supreme 
Court nominees approved. Apparently, 
by confirming a duly elected Presi-
dent’s Supreme Court nominees, the 
Republicans stole the Court’s majority 
which, I guess, apparently, rightfully, 
belongs to the Democrats, and in doing 
so, it ‘‘politicized the Supreme Court’’ 
and ‘‘threatened the rights of millions 
of Americans.’’ 
This legislation, the bill’s Senate 
sponsor says, will ‘‘restore the Court’s 
balance 
and 
public 
standing’’ 
and 
‘‘begin to repair the damage done to 
our judiciary and democracy.’’ That is 
from the Democrat sponsor’s state-
ments with respect to this legislation— 
necessary to ‘‘restore the Court’s bal-
ance and public standing’’ and ‘‘repair 
the damage done to our judiciary and 
democracy.’’ 
Well, there is only one problem, of 
course, and that is that this supposed 
crisis of confidence in the Supreme 
Court doesn’t actually exist. A major-
ity of Americans approve of the job the 
Supreme Court is doing. The Supreme 
Court’s approval rating actually in-
creased—increased—over the course of 
the Trump administration. 
If the junior Senator from Massachu-
setts, who is one of the sponsors of this 
legislation, is looking to address a cri-
sis of confidence, perhaps he should 
take a look at Congress, whose ap-
proval rating is consistently far lower 
than that of the Supreme Court. 
The real crisis—the real crisis we are 
facing—is not a crisis of confidence in 
the Court. It is that Democrats are ap-
parently willing to do long-term dam-
age to our democracy for partisan gain. 
Yes, 
Democrats 
are 
being 
hypo-
critical, and, yes, their Court-packing 
proposal is outrageously and trans-
parently partisan. But, more than that, 
it is dangerous because Democrats’ 
Court packing would eliminate public 
confidence in the nonpartisan char-
acter of the Court. 
Right now, the Supreme Court is gen-
erally seen as being at least somewhat 
above the partisan fray, as the Found-
ers intended—a fact that I think is re-
flected in the Court’s positive approval 
rating. 
And while some Justices are regarded 
as more conservative and some as more 
liberal, Americans don’t see Justices as 
partisan in the way that we see politi-
cians as partisan, and rightly so. 
I can think of more than one signifi-
cant case where supposedly conserv-
ative Justices have sided with the 
Court’s liberals, and there are plenty of 
cases where all of the Supreme Court’s 
Justices have ruled unanimously. 
As Justice Breyer pointed out in his 
recent speech condemning Court pack-
ing, Supreme Court Justices do not fit 
neatly into conservative or liberal cat-
egories. 
But that perception of Supreme 
Court Justices as above partisanship 
would not last long if Democrats suc-
ceeded in packing the Court. 
Just think about it. We have had the 
same number of Supreme Court Jus-
tices, nine—nine Justices—for more 
than 150 years. One hundred and fifty 
years, and then Democrats sweep in, 
announce that the makeup of the Su-
preme Court isn’t to their liking, and 
propose adding four Justices, all of 
them appointed in one fell swoop by a 
Democratic President. And that is in 
addition to any nominations the Presi-
dent might make in the ordinary 
course of things. 
Does any Democrat sincerely think 
that after that any Republican would 
regard the Supreme Court as non-
partisan? Or, for that matter, how 
many Democrats would regard the Su-
preme Court as nonpartisan? 
Just imagine if the roles were re-
versed. Imagine that Republicans were 
proposing to expand the Supreme Court 
and add four Republican-nominated 
Justices. Imagine the howls of outrage 
that would ensue, and rightly so. 
Democrats, the media, the far left—all 
would 
rightfully 
decry 
the 
politicization of the Supreme Court. 
Yet Democrats expect us to believe 
that if it is Democrats who do this, if 
it is Democrats who pack the Supreme 
Court, somehow this move is not a par-
tisan and self-serving one? 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, 
‘‘If anything would make the court 
look partisan, it would be that—one 
side saying, ‘When we’re in power, 
we’re going to enlarge the number of 
judges, so we would have more people 
who would vote the way we want them 
to.’’’ 
That is from the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
Or, in the words of Justice Breyer, ‘‘I 
hope and expect that the court will re-
tain its authority, an authority that 
. . . was hard won. But that authority, 
like the rule of law, depends on trust— 
a trust that the court is guided by 
legal principle, not politics.’’ That is 
from Justice Breyer. 
And Justice Breyer noted: ‘‘Struc-
tural alteration motivated by the per-
ception of political influence can only 
feed that latter perception, further 
eroding that trust.’’ 
As these two reliably liberal Justices 
make clear, Democrats’ Court-packing 
plan would do the very thing Demo-
crats claim to oppose, and that is to 
politicize the court. The Supreme 
Court would quickly lose its non-
partisan standing and quickly become 
a joke. 
Democrats 
cannot 
possibly 
think 
that Court packing would begin and 
end with their move under the Biden 
administration. I can guarantee—guar-
antee—that the next time there is a 
Republican President and a Republican 
Congress, Republicans would be moving 
to ‘‘balance’’ the Democrats’ power 
grab by adding a few seats of their own. 
Then the next Democrat administra-
tion would do the same thing. It 
wouldn’t be long before the Supreme 
Court had expanded to ludicrous pro-
portions. Twenty Justices? Thirty Jus-
tices? Maybe more? 
Instead of a respected and separate 
branch of government, the Supreme 
Court would be co-opted by the legisla-
tive and executive branches. The sepa-
ration of powers, upon which our entire 
Federal Government is built, would be 
destroyed. The consequences of politi-
cizing and trivializing the Court, as 
packing the Court would do, would be 
grave. If Americans don’t respect the 
Court, they will have little reason to 
respect the Court’s decisions or regard 
them as either definitive or binding. 
There has been a lot of concern, 
rightfully so, about the increasingly 
partisan and contentious nature of our 
politics. Politicizing the Court by 
packing the Court would further in-
flame partisan division and lead to in-
creasingly bitter and dangerous fric-
tion in our society. 
It is deeply, deeply disappointing 
that Democrat leaders—and others in 
their caucus who wish to be seen as se-
rious and responsible policymakers— 
haven’t condemned this dangerous pro-
posal to upend a bedrock institution of 
our democracy. 
I understand that it may be difficult 
for them to stand up to the unhinged 
and far-left fringes of their party, and 
it is possible that some of them are re-
luctant to condemn this proposal be-
cause of the partisan advantage it 
would provide. But anyone who cares 
about the health of our democracy and 
the stability of our country should be 
loudly and clearly opposing any discus-
sion of Court packing. 
I hope that at least some of my Dem-
ocrat colleagues will find the courage 
to speak up and consign the idea of 
Court packing to the ash heap of his-
tory, where it should have remained. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2049 
April 20, 2021 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I come to the floor to talk about 
what is very obvious on television—the 
crisis at the southern border. 
During the past several months, the 
American people have watched as a 
full-blown crisis has developed. It has 
reached a catastrophic phase, and it is 
not getting any better. 
Let me reemphasize that whatever 
the Biden administration wants to call 
it, it is a crisis. Simply put, the admin-
istration is in denial, and that denial 
has caused a humanitarian and na-
tional 
crisis. 
For 
example, 
border 
crossings are at the highest level we 
have seen in the last 15 years. Last 
month, Customs and Border Patrol, 
Border Protection, encountered more 
than 170,000 people attempting to cross 
at the southern border. That number 
includes almost 19,000 unaccompanied 
children, which is the highest number 
ever recorded in a single month. 
The surge has overwhelmed personnel 
and prompted the Biden administration 
to put out—would you believe this?— 
emergency calls for volunteers. They 
did that from across the Federal Gov-
ernment. According to news reports 
based on recent Biden administration 
emails, the administration is recruit-
ing NASA employees to sit with chil-
dren at border facilities. Really? That 
is NASA. The border crisis is so bad 
that the Biden administration is trying 
to pull people from NASA and place 
them at the border. 
My fellow Senators, this situation is 
out of control. This is a humanitarian 
and national security crisis. Terrorists, 
smugglers, criminals have seen this as 
their golden opportunity, and they are 
surely taking advantage of it. 
This can’t continue. I have written to 
the Biden administration. I have vis-
ited the border in person. I have seen 
overwhelmed facilities. I have heard 
the calls of the cartel members and 
human traffickers yelling insults from 
across the Rio Grande, taunting Sen-
ators—yes, taunting Senators. 
Senator CORNYN and I have written 
to the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee strongly urging him to hold 
border security hearings. During the 
Trump administration, while I served 
as chairman of the full committee and 
Senator 
CORNYN
served 
as 
sub-
committee chairman, we held no less 
than 15 hearings on oversight of the 
Department of Homeland Security and 
various aspects of our immigration pol-
icy. As chairman of the committee dur-
ing the first 2 years of the Trump ad-
ministration, I held hearings on immi-
gration topics of bipartisan interest to 
all 
committee 
members, 
including 
Democratic 
committee 
members. 
Those hearings included oversight of 
family reunification efforts and the 
Trump administration’s decision to end 
DACA programs. 
In that very same way, I am hopeful 
that Chairman DURBIN will be willing 
to hold hearings on matters of great 
importance to me and committee mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle. I am 
ready to work with him to put together 
hearings that address these problems 
productively. 
During the Easter recess, I instructed 
my oversight and investigative staff to 
get a classified briefing from the De-
partment of Homeland Security, Cus-
toms and Border Protection, and Immi-
gration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement. 
That briefing provided important and 
time-sensitive information that fur-
ther solidifies my belief that the Biden 
administration’s border crisis is a na-
tional security problem. 
Moreover, the Biden administration’s 
denial that there is a border crisis is 
itself a national security problem. You 
can’t solve a problem if you refuse to 
admit that there is such a problem ex-
isting. This head-in-the-sand attitude 
will cost lives. That is what is so sad 
about the situation. It is not making 
anyone’s life any better. In fact, it is 
putting lives at risk, American lives 
and immigrant lives. Yet the adminis-
tration refuses to solve the problem. 
Earlier this month, I requested that 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
Customs and Border Protection, and 
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment, after briefing my investigative 
staff, that they brief the full Judiciary 
Committee, Republicans and Demo-
crats, on a member level. Members 
need to fully understand the national 
security problems at the border with 
respect to terrorists, narcoterrorists, 
human smugglers, and every one of 
their criminal counterparts. We must 
also be fully read in to the methods 
and means that they use to plan and 
accomplish their criminal goals. 
Yesterday, in response to my request 
of these Agencies, the committee had 
that briefing. What we learned is that 
the crisis at the border is getting 
worse, and bad actors are expanding 
their technological edge to become 
more efficient at accomplishing their 
criminal goals. Human smuggling net-
works, cartels, and other bad actors 
are continuing to take full advantage 
of the crisis. 
As to where we go from here, the 
Biden administration knows it has a 
crisis on its hands. It is time to stop 
the denial and act now to solve this 
border crisis. 
INFORMATION SHARING 
Mr. President, on another issue, I 
would like to address my fellow Sen-
ators. This deals with counterfeits and 
the need for the Federal Government 
to modernize its approach to informa-
tion sharing. 
Counterfeits pose a danger to the 
health and safety of consumers. They 
also infringe on U.S. intellectual prop-
erty rights and unfairly benefit inter-
national criminals. 
This will come as no surprise to any-
one: The majority of fake goods come 
from China and Hong Kong. And the 
United States? Well, we are the biggest 
loser when it comes to our intellectual 
property-related crime and activity. 
Unfortunately, the problem of coun-
terfeits has gotten worse during the 
pandemic. Americans have increas-
ingly turned to e-commerce to buy 
goods like personal protective equip-
ment, household products, as well as 
household cleaners, children’s toys, 
and a lot of other items I won’t list. 
Criminals use the same e-commerce 
sites to sell their bogus goods. These 
sites give criminals an air of legit-
imacy and make it harder for law en-
forcement to catch them. E-commerce 
sites also let criminals create multiple 
product listings that can trick con-
sumers into purchasing fake goods. 
Unfortunately, when there is money 
to be made, criminals will find out how 
to profit and do it at the expense of 
others, even in the event of a global 
pandemic. However, there is some good 
news. We have ways of addressing the 
problem. 
Last week, I introduced legislation 
that will give U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection more authority to share in-
formation with rights holders and 
other interested parties on suspected 
counterfeit merchandise. This is an 
issue I first identified as chairman of 
the Senate Finance Committee when I 
investigated counterfeit goods sold on-
line. During this investigation, I dis-
covered that certain U.S. laws prevent 
Customs and Border Protection from 
sharing key pieces of information with 
their private sector partners. As a re-
sult, it is harder for Customs and Bor-
der Protection and its private sector 
partners to detect and disrupt counter-
feiting networks. If they could work 
together and the law allowed it, it 
would be a lot easier to tackle the 
problems. 
To give credit where it is due, Cus-
toms and Border Protection has recog-
nized this problem and is taking steps 
to rectify it through the 21st Century 
Customs 
Framework—for 
short, 
21CCF—to improve data-sharing capa-
bilities in real time. However, without 
statutory authority from Congress, in 
some ways, Customs and Border Pro-
tection has one hand tied behind its 
back. So my bill will get rid of some of 
these barriers for the Agency. It is one 
small but very crucial step toward a 
more secure supply chain. 
Sharing information is a simple solu-
tion that often gets overlooked. How-
ever, it can be an effective tool in cre-
ating comprehensive strategy against 
counterfeit activity. So I am asking 
my colleagues to join me in making 
this legislative fix so that we may cre-
ate a supply chain that addresses a 
21st-century problem. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in a 
State as big as Texas—as the Presiding 
Officer knows, having lived in and 
around Houston for a number of years 
in his previous life—we rely on a strong 
network of roads and bridges to travel 
safely and efficiently. 
We have I–35, which spans the entire 
length of Texas, from north to south, 
and from Laredo all way to Dallas-Fort 
Worth. Much of that stretch, it seems 
like and feels like, is constantly under 
some construction. 
There are bridges that are part of 
people’s daily commutes, like RM 2900 
in Kingsland. After this bridge was de-
stroyed by floodwaters a few years 
back, it didn’t just create inconven-
ience in the community but also risks. 
It could take a firefighter an hour to 
get around the water. 
Fortunately, the Texas Department 
of Transportation and construction 
crews didn’t waste any time, and I was 
able to join the dedication less than a 
year later. You heard that right. The 
bridge was destroyed, and less than a 
year later we dedicated the opening of 
that bridge. 
Then we have critical projects in the 
works, like the ‘‘forts to ports’’ cor-
ridor of I–14, which stretches from Fort 
Hood all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. 
This will connect our critical military 
installations to our seaports and pro-
vide a serious boost to our military 
readiness. 
These are much more than just roads 
and bridges. They are vital parts of our 
daily lives, trade, emergency response, 
and, of course, national security. 
And as we welcome more new Texans 
every day, things are nearing a break-
ing point. We can’t punch above our 
weight much longer when it come to 
our transportation infrastructure. It is 
time—and I believe it is a bipartisan 
belief that this is the time—to invest 
in our Nation’s infrastructure, and we 
know, historically, that this has not 
been a partisan issue. 
I am pro-infrastructure, and I imag-
ine every person in this Chamber would 
tell you the same thing, regardless of 
whether they are from a red State or 
blue State. We have a strong history of 
working together to fund the networks 
of roads, bridges, airports, railroads, 
tunnels, and the ports that the Amer-
ican people rely on. For example, in 
2015, we passed a 5-year highway and 
transit funding bill called the FAST 
Act, with overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port. It received 83 votes here in the 
Senate and 359 votes in the House, as 
well as the signature of President 
Obama. This legislation provided the 
certainty and stability our States need 
to make long-term investments in crit-
ical projects, and it was the first of its 
kind in more than a decade. 
Last Congress, we were poised to pass 
a similar bill. The Environment and 
Public Works Committee developed a 
truly bipartisan example of an infra-
structure bill that built on the success 
of the FAST Act. That was led by 
Chairman 
BARRASSO
and 
Ranking 
Member CARPER, at the time, but it 
was unanimous. This legislation in-
cluded provisions to rebuild our crum-
bling roads and bridges and improve 
road safety, protect the environment, 
and grow the economy. Once again, it 
received broad bipartisan support and 
passed the committee with unanimous 
support. 
As we know, the last year has 
brought us untold changes and, unfor-
tunately, put this and other legislative 
goals 
on 
pause 
while 
we 
battled 
COVID–19. But now is the time to pick 
up where we left off and get a strong 
infrastructure bill signed into law. 
Unfortunately, the proposal by the 
administration is a far cry from what 
the country actually needs. For start-
ers, the cost of the plan is beyond com-
prehension. 
The 
nonpartisan 
Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et estimates said it will cost $2.65 tril-
lion, nearly nine times the size of the 
last highway bill—nine times. 
When talking about this proposal, 
one House Democrat said: ‘‘It’s gonna 
to be a kitchen sink.’’ 
The founding director of the Cornell 
Program in Infrastructure Policy said: 
Well, the administration certainly has 
a ‘‘giant definition’’ for what con-
stitutes ‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
But even journalists are making fun 
of the scope of this plan, with one writ-
ing: ‘‘Maybe the real meaning of infra-
structure is what’s in our hearts.’’ 
Well, these aren’t just jokes. Only 
about 5 percent of this proposal is di-
rected at roads and bridges, what some 
have called core infrastructure. In fact, 
it puts more money toward electric ve-
hicle chargers than pavement that we 
drive on every day. 
The proposal funds a long list of pro-
grams that are a far cry from what 
most people consider to be infrastruc-
ture: caregiving for the elderly and dis-
abled, community colleges, programs 
to improve diversity in STEM careers. 
All of these are significant and impor-
tant issues, but they don’t belong in an 
infrastructure bill—certainly not one 
that proposes to raise taxes on the 
American people or to create more 
debt. 
Then there are the most absurd poli-
cies that really resemble the Green 
New Deal, which I note was just reof-
fered by Senator MARKEY
and Con-
gresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ: more than 
$200 billion to build or retrofit more 
than 2 million ‘‘affordable and sustain-
able’’ places to live, a ‘‘Civilian Cli-
mate Corp,’’ and an unrealistic goal of 
100 percent renewable-generated elec-
tricity by 2035. 
My State is an all-of-the-above State 
when it comes to energy, but I can tell 
you that if all you are depending on is 
renewable energy, without appropriate 
attention to the baseload you need, 
you are going to end up like we did, un-
fortunately, just a couple of months 
ago, with electricity going down due to 
extreme weather. 
I support efforts to rebuild our infra-
structure, but this is not an infrastruc-
ture proposal. This is, really, much 
closer to the Green New Deal 2.0. It is 
an encore to the nearly $2 trillion wish 
list that our Democratic colleagues 
rammed through on a partisan basis 
earlier this year. 
Any attempt to claim that Repub-
licans won’t work with Democrats on 
an infrastructure bill is completely dis-
ingenuous because this is not a good- 
faith attempt at bipartisanship. 
I would be happy to work with our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to craft an infrastructure bill that ad-
dresses our legitimate infrastructure 
problems, and I think every person on 
this side would agree with that. That 
would include traditional transpor-
tation, such as roads and bridges, as 
well as certain forms of nontraditional 
infrastructure, for example, broadband. 
The pandemic has really highlighted 
the digital divide that exists across our 
country, and as Americans relied on 
the internet to work, to attend school, 
for telehealth, and a long list of other 
activities, it has become increasingly 
apparent that we are far from where we 
should be when it comes to broadband 
access in this country. 
There is bipartisan support for a bill 
that addresses our most urgent infra-
structure needs without tacking on un-
related partisan priorities. As far as 
the price tag of the bill, I am not mar-
ried to a particular number. The last 
highway bill that became law was 
roughly $300 billion, and I think we all 
agree there is a need to pursue some-
thing bigger and bolder. But that needs 
to be limited to infrastructure. 
The final pricetag of that bill should 
be the result of bipartisan negotiations 
between Democrats and Republicans, 
not in numbers handed down from the 
administration, unilaterally. 
There is one point I want to make 
abundantly clear: A bipartisan infra-
structure bill must exist instead of, not 
in addition to, our Democrat col-
leagues’ unrelated priorities. We can’t 
work in a bipartisan way to pass one 
bill only to have our Democratic col-
leagues then attempt to jam through 
on a partisan basis on reconciliation 
another long list of their priorities. In 
other words, we have to choose, and 
what I suggest we choose is bipartisan 
infrastructure legislation. 
The choice before our Democratic 
colleagues is whether to work together 
or attempt to go it alone. You really 
can’t have both. 
We also need to be serious about pay-
ing for our infrastructure in a sustain-
able way. We have just spent trillions 
of dollars on coronavirus, not to men-
tion the long list of priorities included 
in the most recent partisan bill. 
This is not a time to continue the 
spending spree. Investments in our

roads and bridges are needed, but we 
need to figure out how they will be 
paid for. The massive tax hikes that 
the President has proposed are not a 
viable option. The burden will be borne 
by both American employers and work-
ers. 
In previous years, the vast majority 
of infrastructure funding came from 
the highway trust fund. Every State 
sends dollars to this fund, which fi-
nances infrastructure across the coun-
try. But the formula to distribute the 
funding is out of date and is facing se-
rious deficits. 
Making matters worse, Texans are 
getting short-changed and carrying the 
weight of these shortfalls, as a so- 
called donor State. We get 92 cents 
back on every dollar we send to Wash-
ington, DC. 
That is not the same treatment for 
every State. In fact, we receive a lower 
rate of return than every other State. 
If we want to have any long-term suc-
cess in maintaining our roads and 
bridges, we need to bring this funding 
formula up to speed as well. 
Unfortunately, the administration’s 
proposal fails to do that, and instead of 
making any repairs to the highway 
trust fund, it leans on damaging tax 
hikes to pay for this broad range of un-
related policies. 
The President has, indeed, proposed 
the largest set of tax hikes in more 
than a half a century. Economics 101 
would teach you that tax increases 
aren’t a clear and easy way to boost 
revenue, especially when your economy 
is already on fragile footing. 
I hope our friends on the other side of 
the aisle will be willing to work with 
us to pass a true infrastructure bill, 
one that will, first and foremost, im-
prove roads, bridges, airports, and 
other critical projects all across the 
country. 
Notably, we must find a responsible 
way to pay for this, but tax hikes are 
not the answer. We have always had 
this idea in the highway trust fund 
that user fees—the people that buy gas-
oline and use the roadways—were the 
ones to pay for them, not pay for them 
out of general revenue. And I think we 
need to continue down this user-fee 
model, as opposed to deficit spending 
and adding to our debt. 
Again, in closing, let me just say, if 
our Democratic friends want to act in 
a bipartisan way, there are people on 
this side of the aisle, including me, 
that would be happy to sit down and 
start talking. But, first of all, our 
Democratic colleagues must agree to 
abandon their long wish list of unre-
lated partisan provisions. They can’t 
work with us on an infrastructure bill 
and then follow it with a reconciliation 
bill that includes the kitchen sink. 
A bipartisan bill to rebuild our crum-
bling roads and bridges is possible. We 
have done it before, and we can do it 
again. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING WALTER FREDERICK MONDALE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as 
we await a very important moment for 
justice in my State today. Our work 
goes on. 
I am here today, first of all, to ac-
knowledge the loss of my mentor, Vice 
President Walter Mondale. He caught 
the Nation’s attention fighting for jus-
tice. So, it is such a moment. He 
worked on the forefront of the right to 
counsel in the landmark case Gideon v. 
Wainwright. 
He followed in the footsteps of Hu-
bert Humphrey to arrive in the Senate. 
He did great things passing civil rights 
legislation. 
As Vice President, he defined the of-
fice of the modern-day Vice President. 
He was ‘‘Fritz’’ to us. He was our at-
torney general, our Senator, and our 
Vice President, and I know he is up 
there right now rooting for justice. 
I am going to speak more about Wal-
ter Mondale next week. Senator SMITH,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2052 
April 20, 2021 
Senator GRASSLEY, and I have a resolu-
tion honoring him for his time in the 
Senate and for his time as Vice Presi-
dent, which we will be presenting next 
week. 
NOMINATIONS OF VANITA GUPTA AND LISA O. 
MONACO 
Mr. President, now, in the name of 
justice and the idea that justice must 
keep rolling along, I want to talk a lit-
tle bit about some of the people we 
need in place as we look to the future, 
as we look to the future of police re-
form and the work that you have done 
as the lead on this bill, Mr. President, 
and the work we have to do. 
To do that, we need a functioning 
Justice Department. We have an Attor-
ney 
General 
who 
is 
excellent 
in 
Merrick Garland. We congratulate Lisa 
Monaco, who is expected to be con-
firmed later today with a strong bipar-
tisan vote. 
But we need more. We need the pres-
ence of true leaders in the Justice De-
partment. We need to see Kristen 
Clarke and Vanita Gupta confirmed. 
Walter Mondale was someone who al-
ways raised the bar. He was someone 
who was ahead of his time. When he in-
troduced 
housing 
legislation 
and 
childcare legislation, a lot of people 
said: Oh, why are you doing that right 
now? 
I think that is a little bit like the ex-
perience of these two women, ahead of 
their time, doing the right thing, 
speaking of raising the bar. 
We know that when many of the 
women of the Senate come to the floor, 
something important is going on. And 
given the challenges our States face 
today, the stakes are high. 
So today we make the case for 
Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, and 
we address the unfair and unsubstan-
tiated attacks we have heard from the 
other side of the aisle against these 
eminently qualified women. I have 
worked closely with Ms. Gupta and Ms. 
Clarke for many years, and I am con-
fident they will lead the Department of 
Justice with honor and integrity. 
Their nominations also represent the 
historic opportunity to make progress 
toward the goal of ensuring that the 
government looks more like the people 
it represents, especially at the Depart-
ment of Justice. When we confirm Ms. 
Gupta, she will be the first civil rights 
lawyer and the first woman of color to 
serve as the Associate Attorney Gen-
eral. And when we confirm Ms. Clarke, 
she will be the first Senate-confirmed 
leader of the Civil Rights Division to 
be a woman of color. 
They will bring years of experience 
to bear to take on the challenges we 
have right now, like hate crimes, on 
which we are taking action this week 
in the Senate; like voting rights, on 
which we just had a hearing today in 
the Judiciary Committee, and in just a 
few weeks we will be marking up the 
For the People Act in the Rules Com-
mittee, which I chair. 
As my State and my country are 
reeling after the killing of Daunte 
Wright, and as we await the verdict in 
the murder of George Floyd, we need 
Ms. Gupta and Ms. CLARKE at the De-
partment of Justice to take on sys-
temic police and criminal justice re-
form. 
They are also the leaders that Attor-
ney General Garland wants at the De-
partment, which I asked him about at 
his nomination hearing. He said Vanita 
Gupta and Kristen Clarke ‘‘have skills 
that I do not have; they have experi-
ences that I do not have.’’ And he said: 
‘‘No human being can have all of the 
skills necessary to run the Justice De-
partment and I need this leadership 
team if I’m going to be successful.’’ 
Attorney General Garland, who was 
confirmed by a bipartisan vote of 76 to 
23, needs his team to be successful. 
That is something all of us should 
want. 
After what we saw during the pre-
vious administration, it is essential 
that the leaders of the Justice Depart-
ment are committed to its independ-
ence in order to restore trust in our 
justice system. This is a priority for 
the Attorney General, and it is a pri-
ority for Vanita Gupta and Kristen 
Clarke. 
Vanita Gupta has demonstrated her 
commitment to the pursuit of justice 
for her entire career. As an attorney 
for the NAACP Legal Defense and Edu-
cational Fund, she worked on the 
frontlines fighting in court to protect 
the civil rights of some of the most 
vulnerable people. 
Later, at the American Civil Lib-
erties Union, she brought cases on be-
half of immigrant children and worked 
to end mass incarceration while keep-
ing communities safe. 
While serving as our country’s chief 
civil rights prosecutor at the Depart-
ment of Justice during the Obama ad-
ministration, Ms. Gupta led critical 
work on criminal justice reform, pros-
ecuting hate crimes and human traf-
ficking, defending the right to vote, 
and 
protecting 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
LGBTQ community and those with dis-
abilities. 
As president of the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights, the 
Nation’s oldest, largest, and most di-
verse civil and human rights coalition, 
Ms. Gupta has a record of fighting for 
all Americans with dedication and a 
willingness to work across ideological 
lines to achieve results. 
Ms. Gupta’s depth of experience at 
the Department of Justice and her 
years as a civil rights attorney make 
her eminently qualified to serve as As-
sociate Attorney General. 
And I have seen—as I know you have, 
Mr. President—her work firsthand. I 
was one of the cosponsors of the FIRST 
STEP Act, which made much needed 
reforms, a bill that you spent so much 
leadership on. And Ms. Gupta worked 
with us, as she brought a broad range 
of organizations and experts in support 
of the bill, including both law enforce-
ment and civil liberties groups. 
Grover Norquist, a Republican and 
president of Americans for Tax Reform, 
who supported the FIRST STEP Act, 
described Ms. Gupta as ‘‘an honest 
broker; someone with an ability not 
only to understand, but also appre-
ciate, different perspectives. She was 
someone who sought consensus.’’ 
As I look at what my State has been 
through for the last year and as we 
await this verdict at this moment, that 
is exactly the kind of person we need at 
the Department right now. And, if you 
have any lingering questions, I say to 
my colleagues, just take a look at the 
number of law enforcement groups that 
have come out in support of her nomi-
nation. Just look at them. She is the 
right person for the job at the right 
time. 
Then there is Kristen Clarke, nomi-
nated to be Assistant Attorney General 
to lead the Civil Rights Division at the 
Department of Justice. Ms. Clarke has 
spent her entire 20-year career fighting 
for civil rights and equal justice under 
the law. 
Early in her career, she worked as an 
attorney in the Criminal Section of the 
Civil Rights Division at the Justice De-
partment, for the Bush Administra-
tion. She investigated and prosecuted 
hate crimes and human trafficking. 
She also worked in the Division’s vot-
ing section. 
Since 2016, she has been the president 
and executive director of the Lawyers’ 
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, 
one of the country’s largest and most 
important civil rights organizations, 
dedicated to the pursuit of equal jus-
tice for all. It is important to note the 
history of the Lawyers’ Committee, 
which was created at the request of 
President John F. Kennedy in the sum-
mer of 1963, perhaps the defining year 
of the civil rights movement. This is an 
organization of attorneys founded to 
organize their peers to use their train-
ing to advance civil rights for all 
Americans. Isn’t that just who we want 
leading the Civil Rights Division at the 
Department of Justice? 
I have worked with Ms. Clarke for 
many years on election issues. She tes-
tified before the Rules Committee and 
impressed everyone on both sides of the 
aisle. 
At that time, she said that following 
the direction of many, she is going to 
work to ensure ‘‘that the Civil Rights 
Division . . . is using the tools in its 
arsenal’’—and she said that now as she 
has been nominated for this position— 
‘‘the Voting Rights Act, the National 
Voter Registration Act, the Uniformed 
and Overseas Absentee Citizens Voting 
Act—to ensure that eligible Americans 
have access to the ballot in our coun-
try.’’ 
She also mentioned that she was here 
in the Senate Chamber in 2006, when 
this body passed the reauthorization of 
the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act—on 
what 
vote?—98 to 0. That is why she has sup-
port from Republicans and Democrats 
who work on these issues. 
Trevor 
Potter, 
who 
previously 
chaired the FEC as a Republican Com-
missioner, called Ms. Clarke ‘‘one of

Tray Grayson, former Secretary of 
State from Kentucky, who is a Repub-
lican and served as chairperson of the 
Republican Association of Secretaries 
of State, sent a letter expressing his 
strong support of Ms. Clarke. 
And we have also heard from former 
Assistant Attorneys General of the

both Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations, who wrote: 
We found Ms. Clarke to be an excellent 
candidate from the standpoint of experience, 
temperament and commitment to the rule of 
law. She has the experience, the commit-
ment and the passion to do this job. 
I am joined by a number of our col-
leagues today. Senator STABENOW was 
here earlier. Senator HIRONO is with us 
on the floor to stand up for Ms. Gupta 
and Ms. Clarke and to reject the false-
hoods we have heard from our col-
leagues on the other side. But we are 
also here to make the case for why we 
must seize this historic opportunity to 
send two women of color to lead the 
Justice Department. 
So at this pivotal moment we live in, 
at this very moment, my message to 
my friends, Vanita and Kristen, today, 
is this: We have your backs, just as you 
have the backs of the people of this 
country. 
Those jurors in Minnesota, they are 
not talking to each other about if they 
are Democrats or Republicans. They 
have a job to do. The witnesses that 
came forward in that case, people who 
just happened to be there—a store 
clerk doing his job, a man who just 
happened to walk by, the police offi-
cers who testified—they didn’t ask peo-
ple what political party they were in. 
They just came forward. That is why I 
ask my colleagues to step back and 
think about what justice really means 
today and what it will mean tomorrow, 
and ask them to support Ms. Gupta and 
Ms. Clarke to serve with Merrick Gar-
land and Lisa Monaco to run the De-
partment of Justice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I echo 
the sentiments expressed by my col-
league from Minnesota, and I rise 
today in support of the nomination of 
Vanita Gupta to be Associate Attorney 
General of the United States. Today, I 
am focusing my remarks on Ms. Gupta, 
but I will have some words of support 
for Kristen Clarke later. 
For 4 years, Donald Trump treated 
the Justice Department like his per-
sonal law firm. He ordered that the De-
partment’s attorneys drop charges or 
reduce 
sentencing 
recommendations 
against his friends and cronies. He or-
dered investigations and prosecutions 
against his political enemies. He even 
had the Department step in to defend 
him against the defamation claim re-
lating to an allegation of rape. 
By the end of the Trump administra-
tion, the Justice Department’s reputa-
tion was tarnished and the morale of 
its employees was lower than at any 
point since Watergate. 
Thankfully, 
President 
Biden 
has 
named a professional, highly qualified 
team to lead the Justice Department 
and to restore its place of prominence 
and moral authority in following the 
rule of law. 
It is significant that the Senate con-
firmed Merrick Garland as Attorney 
General and will shortly confirm Lisa 
Monaco as Deputy Attorney General 
with strong bipartisan support. 
I am disappointed that Vanita Gupta, 
a similarly well-qualified nominee, is 
not receiving the same bipartisan sup-
port. 
A few weeks ago, I sat in the Judici-
ary Committee for nearly 2 hours, lis-
tening to my Republican colleagues 
smear Ms. Gupta with lies about her 
record—lies like that she wants to de-
criminalize all drugs, that she wants to 
defund the police, that she is somehow 
responsible for the production of crys-
tal meth in Mexico. 
When Chair DURBIN finally called for 
a vote, not a single Republican sup-
ported Ms. Gupta’s nomination. As I 
sat there listening to these lies and 
smears, I asked myself a question, and 
I am still pondering that question 
today: What exactly are Republicans 
afraid of? 
Unlike many of President Trump’s 
nominees, Vanita Gupta is actually 
qualified to help lead the Justice De-
partment. Throughout her career, Ms. 
Gupta has shown the strategic acumen, 
dogged determination, and coalition- 
building skills necessary to navigate 
the challenges facing our country. 
As a young attorney with the ACLU, 
she worked to exonerate 38 wrongfully 
convicted men and women in Tulia, 
TX. Mostly people of color, these indi-
viduals had been convicted of drug 
crimes based on the testimony of a sin-
gle undercover police officer and sen-
tenced to prison for periods of up to 434 
years. 
Ms. Gupta was able to show that the 
officer was racially biased and had a 
reputation for dishonesty. She dem-
onstrated that he falsified reports and 
misidentified defendants. In light of 
this evidence, the court found that the 
officer ‘‘may be the most devious, non- 
responsive law enforcement witness 
this Court has witnessed in 25 years on 
the bench in Texas.’’ 
The case was so compelling that 
then-Texas Governor Rick Perry par-
doned 35 of the defendants. It was such 
a miscarriage of justice that those par-
doned individuals ultimately received a 
$6 million settlement. 
Ms. Gupta later went on to lead the 
Justice Department Civil Rights Divi-
sion. In this role, she stood up to the 
rights of transgender students and pris-
oners, fought discrimination against 
servicemembers, 
and 
defended 
the 
right to vote. 
From there, Ms. Gupta served as 
President and CEO of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
where, among other things, she played 
a key role in passing the most signifi-
cant criminal justice reform package 
in years. 
Ms. Gupta’s qualifications are borne 
out in this experience and in the wide-
spread support that she has received. 
Conservative leaders and longtime Re-
publicans like Michael Chertoff, Grover 
Norquist, and Michael Steele have 
praised Ms. Gupta as a consensus build-
er on critical issues like voting rights 
and criminal justice reform. 
Every major law enforcement organi-
zation, including the Fraternal Order 
of Police and National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, has endorsed Ms. Gupta’s nom-
ination. 
In light of this widespread support, it 
is tough to take the criticisms I hear 
from my colleagues on the other side 
seriously. 
If 
Ms. 
Gupta 
supported 
defunding the police or decriminalizing 
all drugs, how did she manage to get 
universal support from the law enforce-
ment community? If she is such a rad-
ical progressive, why are people like 
Grover Norquist and the former gen-
eral counsel and senior vice president 
of Koch Industries endorsing her nomi-
nation? 
Republican criticism of Ms. Gupta is 
also hard to take seriously after they 
spent the past 4 years—4 years, and I 
was there—pushing through some DOJ 
and judicial nominees who were either 
wholly unqualified, openly supported 
disenfranchisement of Black Ameri-
cans, or were even credibly accused of 
sexual assault. 
After 4 years of permissive deference 
to Donald Trump, it is rich to hear my 
Republican colleagues attacking and 
demeaning a strong, smart, and highly 
qualified woman of color like Vanita 
Gupta to serve in the Justice Depart-
ment. Their attacks aren’t an exercise 
of the Senate’s constitutional duty to 
provide advice and consent. It is pure 
partisan politics at its worst. 
President Biden nominated Vanita 
Gupta to serve as Associate Attorney 
General because she is the best person 
for the job, and the Senate should con-
firm her without further delay. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
from police reform to anti-Asian hate 
crimes, Americans across the Nation 
are pushing, pulling, and tugging with 
all their might to make sure that the 
United States lives up to our founding 
ideals of equality and justice for all. At 
the same time, the Biden administra-
tion is charged with the immense re-
sponsibility of restoring confidence and 
integrity to the U.S. Department of 
Justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2054 
April 20, 2021 
Donald Trump’s political appointees 
undermined the Department’s mission 
and demoralized its dedicated career 
civil servants through years of gross 
mismanagement 
and 
improper 
politicization. 
We 
desperately 
need 
leaders with integrity, honor, and just 
basic competence to restore morale at 
the Department of Justice and em-
power the Agency to meet the moment. 
Fortunately, I am confident that 
both Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke 
are among the most qualified and pre-
pared public servants to take on the 
daunting challenges that lie ahead. 
For far too many people in this coun-
try, equal protection under the law is 
not a reality. All across this country, 
there are communities that believe— 
and for good reason—that the law is 
not on their side. Individuals fear com-
ing forward to report that they have 
been a victim of a hate crime, or, even 
worse, law enforcement fails to iden-
tify and report racist violence and dis-
crimination. 
And the senseless killing of unarmed 
Black and Brown Americans at the 
hands of law enforcement has become 
an all-too-common occurrence. Just a 
few days ago, the country was shocked 
by video footage documenting local law 
enforcement officers brazenly threat-
ening and assaulting an Army second 
lieutenant who was in his military uni-
form and simply asking to know why 
he had been pulled over. 
If this is how the Windsor Police De-
partment, while knowing it is being 
videotaped, treats an Army officer in 
uniform—a man who swore an oath to 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States with his own life, if 
necessary—one wonders if such mis-
conduct represents a systemic pattern 
or practice of abuse. This incident sim-
ply reinforces why our Nation must 
have a strong and proactive DOJ Civil 
Rights Division. 
Additionally, the promise of the ADA 
is still not a reality for far too many 
Americans 
with 
disabilities. 
After 
years of disability rights being ne-
glected or, at worst, undermined by 
partisan efforts, it is time for the DOJ 
to step up and ensure that the rights of 
Americans with disabilities are fully 
recognized, enforced, and protected. 
I look forward to working with 
Kristen Clarke and Vanita Gupta to 
fulfill the promise that America made 
to people with disabilities, including 
myself, over 30 years ago. 
We need Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke’s 
leadership at DOJ to energize and in-
spire the Department as it refocuses on 
its mission of ensuring the fair and im-
partial administration of justice for all 
Americans. 
As a former head of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice Civil Rights Division 
and leader of the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights, 
which is one of the largest civil rights 
organizations 
in 
the 
Nation, 
Ms. 
Gupta’s record shows that she is com-
mitted to advancing the rights of all 
Americans. 
Her decades of effective leadership 
and advocacy are why her nomination 
has garnered widespread support not 
only from civil rights groups but also 
from prominent law enforcement orga-
nizations like the Fraternal Order of 
Police. 
Likewise, Ms. Clarke is widely re-
spected and admired as one of our 
country’s leading legal experts on civil 
rights. She has proven her effectiveness 
in defending the civil rights of all 
Americans as a Federal and State offi-
cial, as well as a leader of the NAACP, 
and, most recently, as the president of 
the national Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law. 
Representation matters. Confirming 
these barrier-breaking women, who 
would both be the first women of color 
to formally occupy the positions to 
which they have been nominated, sends 
a clear message we are committed to 
having our Federal Government’s lead-
ership look like the country that it 
serves. 
There should be no doubts about 
these 
nominees’ 
qualifications 
for 
these critical DOJ leadership positions, 
and I urge my Senate colleagues in 
joining me to confirm Vanita Gupta 
and Kristen Clarke. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today alongside my colleagues to 
urge the Senate to quickly confirm 
Vanita Gupta as Associate Attorney 
General. Ms. Gupta is eminently quali-
fied, with an impressive background in 
public service and broad support from 
civil rights organizations and law en-
forcement organizations. It is pretty 
impressive when you look at everyone 
who is supporting her because of her 
competency and her work. 
She will be effective on day one, and 
we don’t have a good day to lose right 
now. Right now, Americans are at risk 
of losing their fundamental rights—our 
right to vote, our right to be treated 
fairly in a court of law, and even our 
right to safely walk down the street 
and not be targeted based on what we 
look like, who we are. It is the job of 
the Department of Justice to protect 
these rights and so much more. 
Take voting rights. Across our Na-
tion, this right, called ‘‘sacred’’ by our 
beloved late Congressman John Lewis, 
is under attack. It is under attack in 
Michigan, as well as other States, as 
well as the entire country. Republicans 
in the Michigan Legislature are trying 
to push through a package of bills that 
would take away people’s freedom to 
vote. Our secretary of state has said 
that in some ways, it is worse than 
what they passed in Georgia. 
Let me remind everyone that last 
November, in the middle of a pan-
demic, more people in Michigan voted 
than ever voted in the history of our 
State. When audits were done, time 
after time after time, it was clear there 
was no fraud—no fraud that they found 
in this election. 
Mr. President, 5.5 million people in 
Michigan 
voted. 
Michigan 
counties 
verified it. Our State certified it. That 
should be something we should all cele-
brate. But because they didn’t like who 
folks voted for, they didn’t like the re-
sults, Michigan Republicans are com-
ing after Michigan voters to take away 
their freedom to vote. 
Michigan voters need Vanita Gupta 
in their corner because it is a corner 
that she has been in before. During her 
time at the Department of Justice, she 
oversaw a number of high-profile vot-
ing rights cases, including challenges 
to voter suppression laws in North 
Carolina and Texas. 
She has also been a leader in fighting 
discrimination. Across the country, we 
have seen increasing instances of hate 
crimes, particularly those targeting 
Asian Americans. According to the 
group Stop AAPI Hate, there have been 
about 3,800 incidents of Asian Ameri-
cans being targeted in the past year. 
Twenty-five of those incidents hap-
pened in Michigan. I know that Asian 
Americans across our country are liv-
ing in fear right now, wondering if it is 
safe to go to the grocery store or if 
they need to tell their elderly mom or 
dad not to walk alone outside. 
We have an important hate crimes 
bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
right now. It has bipartisan support. It 
is terrific, and we need to get that 
passed. But in order to make sure we 
fully implement that and have the 
leadership in the Department to do 
that, we need to make sure Vanita 
Gupta is confirmed. Under Ms. Gupta, 
hate crimes and discrimination will be 
taken seriously at the Department of 
Justice. We know this because it is 
what she has done her entire career. 
Vanita Gupta would be the first civil 
rights lawyer and the first woman of 
color to serve as Associate Attorney 
General. That is important because 
when agencies’ leaders have diverse ex-
periences and backgrounds, agencies 
are better able to make more informed 
decisions. They make sense. And when 
our Nation’s leaders look like the di-
verse communities they serve, our 
communities are more likely to have 
confidence in their leadership. 
Vanita Gupta is the right person at 
the right time for the Department of 
Justice. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port her nomination and to confirm her 
together on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I under-
stand a couple of my colleagues are on 
the way. I will defer to them when they 
arrive. But I want to thank, first, Sen-
ator STABENOW for her statement about 
Vanita Gupta.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2055 
April 20, 2021 
This is an extraordinary person. The 
Presiding Officer, as a member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, was there 
for her testimony and knows her per-
sonally, and I have come to know her. 
When you read and learn of her per-
sonal story, it is amazing, nothing 
short of amazing. 
She was 6 months graduated from 
law school when she was sent down to 
Texas, a town called Tulia, TX, to 
tackle an assignment that a veteran 
civil rights lawyer would have thought 
twice about tackling. There was a 
group of over 30 African Americans 
who had been falsely accused of drug 
dealing and convicted and were impris-
oned when she was sent down there to 
try to do something after their convic-
tion. It is an incredible story, the cour-
age she showed 6 months out of law 
school, and she ultimately was success-
ful. Those African Americans and oth-
ers were pardoned by the Republican 
Governor of Texas, Governor Perry. 
They were given a cash award for dam-
ages they had suffered as a result of it. 
Her commitment to civil rights is 
more than just a cerebral commitment; 
it is a commitment where she has 
risked many times her personal safety 
to show how much she cared for the 
rights of others. 
Thank you for saying those kind 
words about her. I am hoping that the 
Senate will give her a chance to con-
tinue to serve our Nation. 
NOMINATION OF LISA O. MONACO 
Mr. President, I would like to speak 
now, if I can, to a vote that is coming 
up momentarily, and that is the vote 
for Lisa Monaco to be the next Deputy 
Attorney General. 
The Deputy Attorney General—com-
monly known as the DAG—is the sec-
ond highest ranking official in the Jus-
tice Department. The DAG is effec-
tively the DOJ’s chief operating offi-
cer, overseeing the Department’s day- 
to-day operations. 
Lisa Monaco may be the most quali-
fied individual ever nominated to be 
Deputy Attorney General. That is say-
ing something, but I think we can back 
it up. Her credentials include a wealth 
of experience, her commitment to re-
storing independence and integrity at 
the Justice Department, and the broad, 
broad range of support she has gar-
nered. 
Let me begin with her experience. 
She has served at nearly every level of 
the Justice Department. She knows 
that Agency, and she knows what it 
can do. She was an assistant U.S. at-
torney, counselor and chief of staff to 
the Director of the FBI, Associate Dep-
uty Attorney General, Principal Asso-
ciate Deputy Attorney General, and 
the Assistant Attorney General for the 
National Security Division. 
She is also one of the Nation’s fore-
most national security experts. That is 
when I first met her, working in the 
Obama White House. As President 
Obama’s Deputy National Security Ad-
visor, Ms. Monaco coordinated the Fed-
eral Government’s response to major 
security threats, including pandemics, 
terrorism, mass shootings, and cyber 
attacks. 
Our Nation is facing serious chal-
lenges today: the COVID–19 pandemic; 
a gun violence pandemic; a surge in 
hate crimes; domestic violence extre-
mism, which culminated in an assault 
on the U.S. Capitol and this very 
Chamber just a few short weeks ago; 
and global threats and challenges from 
Russia, 
China, and elsewhere. Ms. 
Monaco’s experience responding to se-
curity threats has prepared her to 
oversee DOJ’s operations at this crit-
ical moment in history. 
But it is not only Ms. Monaco’s na-
tional security expertise that makes 
her the right person for this role. After 
President Trump used the Justice De-
partment to serve his own personal and 
political agenda, we need to restore a 
well-functioning, independent Depart-
ment, committed to the principle of 
equal justice under the law. It is just 
that basic. 
Ms. Monaco understands the impor-
tance of protecting DOJ’s independ-
ence. She has praised two of her men-
tors, Attorney General Janet Reno and 
FBI Director Bob Mueller, for their 
‘‘reverence for the institution, for up-
holding the norms and traditions of 
independence and of doing justice with-
out fear or fervor, and never, ever let-
ting politics or partisanship influence 
an investigation or prosecution deci-
sion.’’ 
She committed to me that she would 
have the same reverence. That is pre-
cisely the attitude we need to restore 
the Justice Department’s integrity. 
It is no surprise, then, that individ-
uals from across the political spectrum 
support Ms. Monaco’s nomination. The 
Judiciary Committee received scores of 
letters from a broad range of advocacy 
groups: the Alliance for Justice, gun 
safety organizations, law enforcement 
groups, environmental organizations, 
victims and survivors of crime, and so 
many more. 
We also received a letter supporting 
Ms. 
Monaco’s 
nomination 
from 
29 
former senior DOJ officials who have 
served under Presidents of both par-
ties, including Attorneys General Lo-
retta Lynch and Eric Holder, who 
served in the Obama administration, 
and 
Attorneys 
General 
Michael 
Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, who 
served in the George W. Bush adminis-
tration. She has that kind of bipartisan 
support. 
Those DOJ officials wrote of Ms. 
Monaco: ‘‘She has the values, tempera-
ment and strength to perform at the 
highest level of the Department.’’ 
They went on to say: ‘‘Each of us 
knows how demanding this job is, with 
its extraordinary span of control and 
the need for strong principled leader-
ship. We believe that Ms. Monaco is 
highly qualified for this role. She 
knows the Department from every 
angle. She understands the job. And 
she has prepared well for it. We urge 
her confirmation.’’ 
Attorney 
General 
Garland 
has 
praised Ms. Monaco’s selection as the 
next Deputy Attorney General. He told 
us in the Judiciary Committee that he 
needed her on his leadership team at 
the Department, and so does the Na-
tion. I look forward to voting for Ms. 
Monaco and urge all of my colleagues 
to do the same. 
ANNIVERSARY OF OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING 
Mr. President, it was an idyllic 
spring morning in Oklahoma City 26 
years ago. Downtown, the Alfred P. 
Murrah Building was bustling with ac-
tivity as people went about their morn-
ing routines. Parents dropped off their 
children at the daycare center on the 
second floor, office workers sat at their 
desks, with fresh mugs of coffee in 
hand—and parked under the building 
was a truck containing nearly 7,000 
pounds of explosive materials. 
At 9:02, the truck exploded, killing 
more than 165 people and injuring hun-
dreds more. Oklahoma City and Amer-
ica would be forever scarred by the 
bombing. It was the deadliest act of 
homegrown terrorism in modern Amer-
ican history. For most people, that 
day—April 19, 1995—is a somber day in 
our history, but for some, it was an 
opening salvo in a war against Amer-
ica. 
More than a quarter century after 
the 
Oklahoma 
City 
bombing, 
the 
threat of violent extremism looms 
larger than ever before. Recently, the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
warned that violent, White supremacy 
is now the ‘‘most persistent and lethal 
threat in the homeland.’’ 
Among the hundreds of Americans 
arrested for suspected ties to violent 
White supremacy in recent years, a 
common theme has emerged: The FBI 
has uncovered references to Timothy 
McVeigh and his attack on Oklahoma 
City in ‘‘several’’ of these investiga-
tions. In the eyes of far-right extrem-
ists, McVeigh’s attack on Oklahoma 
City is a lodestar, and like McVeigh, 
many of the violent extremists active 
today are motivated by baseless, anti- 
government conspiracy theories, con-
spiracy theories like the ‘‘Big Lie,’’ 
which inspired a mob of extremists to 
storm the Capitol on January 6. 
More than 400 people are facing Fed-
eral charges for their involvement in 
the January 6 insurrection. Last week, 
we received word of the first guilty 
plea in that case. The defendant, who 
has agreed to fully cooperate with the 
Federal Government, is a founding 
member of the Oath Keepers, a far- 
right extremist group that helped plot 
the insurrection. 
The defendant’s affiliation with the 
Oath Keepers highlights an important 
distinction between the extremists of 
yesterday, like Timothy McVeigh, and 
the extremists of today. Today, violent 
White supremacists are not only ped-
dling debunked conspiracy theories or 
disproven race science; they are orga-
nizing online, on radical platforms like 
8chan and Parler, and coordinating at-
tacks under the cover of anonymity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2056 
April 20, 2021 
Worse yet, these radicals have easy ac-
cess to high-grade military weapons de-
signed for one purpose: human slaugh-
ter. 
The extremists of today are galva-
nized. They are organized. And they 
are deadly. We must equip our law en-
forcement officials and intelligence 
agencies with new, modernized re-
sources to combat the growing threat 
of violent White supremacy. 
There are a number of steps we can 
take to weed out the threat of domes-
tic terrorism. This week, the Senate is 
considering one such step: the COVID– 
19 Hate Crimes Act. It would direct 
Federal resources toward addressing 
the rise in hate crimes against mem-
bers of the Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander, AAPI, community. This legis-
lation must be passed immediately. 
Nearly 3,800 hate incidents against 
members of the AAPI community have 
been reported between March of last 
year and February of this year. 
We 
also 
will 
consider 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and Senator MORAN’s NO 
HATE Act, which has been added as an 
amendment to the bill to improve hate 
crimes reporting. In addition to that 
legislation, there are more comprehen-
sive steps we can take to address the 
broader threat of domestic terrorism. 
In March, I reintroduced the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act. It will en-
hance the Federal Government’s abil-
ity to prevent acts of extremist vio-
lence. By establishing dedicated offices 
to combat domestic terrorism at the 
Department of Justice, the FBI, and 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
the Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act will bring the Federal Govern-
ment’s efforts to weed out violent 
White supremacy into the 21st century. 
Congress must also take steps to 
limit access to the weapons of war fa-
vored by violent extremists. This is a 
no-brainer. The House recently passed 
a bipartisan bill to close existing gaps 
in the background checks system. I 
certainly hope we can find 10 Repub-
lican votes to overcome a filibuster 
and get that signed into law. Let me be 
clear: Background checks are table 
stakes 
for 
combatting 
the 
public 
health crisis that is gun violence in 
America. We are just 4 months into 
2021, and already there have been more 
than 150 mass shootings in our country. 
It is time to put politics aside and save 
American lives. 
As chair of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I was honored to gavel in 
the confirmation hearing for the man 
who led the government’s investigation 
into the Oklahoma City bombing: At-
torney General Merrick Garland. Yes-
terday, with a slightly greyer head of 
hair and the full authority of the Jus-
tice Department behind him, Attorney 
General Garland returned to the site of 
the bombing. He promised the residents 
of Oklahoma City that ‘‘the Depart-
ment of Justice is pouring its resources 
into stopping domestic violent extrem-
ists before they can attack . . . pros-
ecuting those who do . . . and battling 
the spread of the kind of hate that 
leads to tragedies like the one we mark 
here today.’’ 
The question for us here in the Sen-
ate is, Will we help Attorney General 
Garland lead the charge against the 
largest threat we face today? Will we 
work together to save future lives 
against attacks like the Oklahoma 
City bombing? 
In Attorney General Garland, we 
have a leader who is committed to 
weeding out the threat of domestic ter-
rorism. Are there enough leaders in the 
Senate who are willing to do the same? 
I sure hope so. I hope they will join me 
in taking immediate, meaningful ac-
tion to combat the crisis of violent ex-
tremism. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATIONS OF VANITA GUPTA AND KRISTEN 
CLARKE 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to sup-
port the nominations of Vanita Gupta 
and Kristen Clarke to serve in the lead-
ership of the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice, and I am here, Mr. President, to 
say that just because you are pro-civil 
rights does not mean that you are 
somehow anti-police. To be for a De-
partment of Justice that will help us 
make the right decisions in enforcing 
civil rights laws around the United 
States is what is at stake with these 
nominations. I personally am tired of 
the challenges that we have faced at 
home when we do not have people being 
held accountable and we have incident 
after incident. And the last administra-
tion said, instead of playing our role on 
consent decrees and making sure fed-
eral civil rights laws are enforced, in-
stead they said, ‘‘We’re going to stop 
playing that role.’’ 
So it is so important that we get a 
Department of Justice that will fight 
for the civil rights and civil liberties of 
all Americans. Both these women are 
highly qualified. They have defended 
our constitution. They have defended 
the civil rights of all Americans, and 
they will ensure that everyone, includ-
ing the police, are held accountable. 
We have probably heard this afternoon 
my colleagues praising Vanita Gupta 
and supporting her to serve as Asso-
ciate Attorney General, the third high-
est position in the U.S. Department of 
Justice. She is very qualified for the 
position. She will be the first civil 
rights lawyer and woman of color to 
serve in this role. She led the Civil 
Rights Division during the Obama ad-
ministration and previously served as 
an attorney with the American Civil 
Liberties Union. When it came to en-
forcing consent decrees, she made sure 
the Obama administration did the job. 
Now, why is this so important? I can 
tell you, in Seattle, we had a Native- 
American carver who happened to stop 
carving on one corner to walk to an-
other corner and was shot and killed by 
a police officer because he didn’t re-
spond immediately to ‘‘Drop your 
knife.’’ I am so glad the Federal Gov-
ernment was there to say what is going 
on in Seattle with the police depart-
ment and overseeing on a consent de-
cree. We had a tragic situation in Spo-
kane where a disabled man just went in 
to buy a soft drink and snacks, but be-
cause somebody thought he was fooling 
around with the ATM machine, they 
called the police. And when the police 
arrived and he didn’t respond imme-
diately, he was brutally beaten in the 
head with a baton, tasered, improperly 
hogtied to the ground, and stopped 
breathing shortly after first responders 
improperly strapping a non-rebreather 
mask to his face. That was Otto 
Zehm’s afternoon activity, to just go 
to the store. As he lay there dying, he 
said, ‘‘All I wanted was a Snickers.’’ 
And thank God we had a Civil Rights 
Division at the U.S. Department of 
Justice that said, yes, we are going to 
intervene and make sure that there is 
oversight of the Seattle Police Depart-
ment and an investigation, and we are 
going to make sure that the civil lib-
erties of all Americans—all Americans, 
whether you are White, Black, or dis-
abled, or Native American—your civil 
rights are going to be upheld. But in-
stead of discussing what is the proper 
role of the Federal Government in 
making sure that civil liberties and 
civil rights of all Americans are upheld 
when their rights are violated—in-
stead, people have said, Well, Ms. 
Gupta supports decriminalization of all 
drugs. 
Well, from a State that has actually 
passed legislation legalizing the rec-
reational use of marijuana, I guarantee 
you, my State views some of these 
issues very differently. But I can say, 
emphatically, Ms. Gupta has stated 
consistently she does not support the 
decriminalization of all drugs—nor do 
the people of Washington, just because 
they voted to legal marijuana. 
Ms. Gupta does not claim that all 
drugs should be legal, and she does not 
adhere to the statements that some 
people have tried to paint her with. 
You have to ask yourself, What are 
they afraid of? What are they afraid 
that she is going to do at the Depart-
ment of Justice besides uphold our 
civil liberties? Some of my colleagues 
have 
argued 
that 
she 
supports 
defunding the police. There is zero 
proof that she supports defunding the 
police. I don’t know why we keep hav-
ing this debate, but she has worked and 
understands the police officers’ per-
spective. She has worked to ensure 
that they were provided with adequate 
resources. She has worked on building 
relationships. She has a comprehensive 
approach to law enforcement and sup-
port from their organizations. And I

believe she deserves the support of our 
colleagues. 
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice described Ms. Gupta as one who 
‘‘always worked with us to find com-
mon ground, even when that seemed 
impossible.’’ So it is clear that she has 
the support of police. So we need some-
one like her who is going to bring back 
this important role of oversight to 
these important issues. 
Ms. Clarke is the same. She is nomi-
nated to head the Civil Rights Division 
where she once worked as a trial law-
yer. She previously codirected the vot-
ing rights work of the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, led the 
Civil Rights Bureau in the New York 
State Attorney General’s office, and 
has served as the president of the Law-
yers Committee on Civil Rights Under 
the Law. I have called her; I have inter-
viewed her. Why? Because I am tired of 
the violence and hate crimes in the 
State of Washington. I am tired of 
hearing, time and time again, about 
these issues. And it can be the syna-
gogue in Spokane, where literally 
somebody spray-painted it. And you 
would think, Well, how are we going to 
find who spray-painted a swastika on a 
synagogue in Spokane? You think, How 
are we going to find that person? Okay. 
Not a lot of trouble because people ac-
tually said, We did it purposely because 
we are an organization who believes in 
this, and we wanted to get our message 
out. That is what we’re facing. 
And several years ago, we found a 
bomb planted in the Martin Luther 
King Day Parade in Spokane, just a 
few years ago. So these aren’t issues 
that we are sending somebody over to 
the Department of Justice to analyze 
and write a report on. We are asking 
people to help us with the situation in 
the United States of America to fight 
hate crimes and to bring about justice 
on the civil rights and civil liberties of 
all Americans. And so we have to have 
people that we have confidence that 
they are going to uphold our laws and 
enforce them. 
We need to have consent decrees to 
hold police departments accountable 
for systematic violations of constitu-
tional rights. We need to defend voting 
rights and to make sure that hate 
crimes against Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islanders are prosecuted. And so 
this is why the nomination of Ms. 
Clarke is so important. I ask my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, if 
you are facing any of this in your 
State, please get Kristen Clarke to be 
there to help us address these issues. 
Advocating for increased investment 
in mental health and social work and 
school resources for minority commu-
nities is something that law enforce-
ment agrees with. They agree that we 
should do these things. So that is not 
defunding the police; yet people accuse 
Kristen Clarke of the same thing. She 
must be for defunding the police. I have 
talked to prosecutors throughout the 
State of Washington, and they will tell 
me that these programs that help fami-
lies and communities identify these 
problems early are actually the best 
things to keep them from having to 
really have problems later. I certainly 
hope that some of the false claims that 
people have made about Ms. Clarke 
being anti-police are also continued to 
be struck down as untrue. 
Ms. Clarke understands law enforce-
ment must collaborate with the State, 
local, and Federal level. She has a solid 
record of working cooperatively with 
law enforcement for decades. She is 
supported by the Major Cities Chief As-
sociation, the National Association of 
Black Law Executives, a bipartisan 
group of over 70 former State attorneys 
general, and more than 40 police chiefs 
and sheriffs throughout the United 
States. That can’t be somebody who 
sounds 
anti-law 
enforcement. 
They 
have the support of law enforcement. 
What we need is the support of our 
colleagues to say that these are serious 
issues and the Federal Government 
does play a role. That is why it is 
called the Department of Justice, and 
that is why they oversee and make 
sure that the civil liberties of all 
Americans are upheld. As attorney 
general and at the Lawyers Committee, 
Ms. Clarke played a key role in launch-
ing a Religious Rights Initiative to ad-
dress 
faith-based 
discrimination 
to 
fight anti-Semitic activities. When Ms. 
Clarke led the Lawyers Committee, she 
led the charge in shutting down abhor-
rent anti-Semitic websites that made 
racist comments, and some were in 
connection with stormfront.org, which 
was a central site used to organize the 
2017 Unite the Right rally in Char-
lottesville. 
She recognized that online hate is an 
emerging threat and that Congress 
must address that threat. After seeing 
what happened on January 6 and the 
plethora of anti-Semitic paraphernalia 
presented here even in the Capitol as 
we saw riots, Ms. Clarke’s expertise 
and dedication to fighting online hate 
would be extremely beneficial to the 
Department and to all Americans. 
So I implore my colleagues, these are 
strong women, great qualifications, 
have been in the mix on these policy 
issues for a long time. They know what 
we are up against. We have to ask our-
selves, Are we going to enforce the 
law? These women will enforce the law, 
and they have the support of law en-
forcement. We should proceed and con-
firm both of them. 
I yield the floor.

DEFENSE BUDGET 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last 
week—no, it wasn’t last week; it was 
about 3 weeks ago, I guess, now, Presi-
dent Biden released his ‘‘skinny budg-
et,’’ which gave us a top-line for de-
fense of $715 billion. This is a reduc-
tion, and I want to make sure everyone 
understands this because the cut is ac-
tually below inflation, and that is not 
where we are supposed to be. 
You know, we have this document 
here that everyone agrees with. I don’t 
know one person—and this was written 
by six Democrats, six Republicans, and 
this was in 2018. This has been used as 
our blueprint ever since that time, and 
it is just remarkable the way it has 
come out. The recommendations on 
this, as I said, were made by six Repub-
licans, six Democrats. All of them were 
experts in the field of defense, and they 
came out with recommendations. In 
this year, the amount in the budget for 
our military is supposed to be between 
3 and 5 percent. This is in the docu-
ment in front of us here. Of course, this 
is actually a reduction. So it is way 
below what has been prescribed. 
When it comes to China, there are 
two big reasons we need to make sure 
our budget matches our strategy. First 
of all, China is spending more on their 
military than ever before. As a result, 
they are getting more technologically 
advanced and starting to sway the 
military balance of power in their 
favor. There is no question about it, 
and I will document that in a minute. 
The threat the Chinese military 
poses is not a distant threat. It is not 
something that might happen in 2030, 
2035, or sometime in the future. It is a 
problem we face today, right now, and 
it only gets worse over time. 
Admiral Davidson told the Armed 
Services Committee that he expects 
the threat to manifest ‘‘this decade, in 
fact, in the next six years.’’ That is the 
sense of urgency. That is when they be-
come greater than we are in many 
areas of defense and aggression. 
So today I would like to spend some 
time dealing with the Chinese military 
and what they are doing. This is what 
we are up against. This is why it is so 
important that we get our defense 
budget right. 
Let’s start with China’s military 
budget. Since 2000, Beijing’s spending 
on the People’s Liberation Army has 
gone up 450 percent—450 percent. Now, 
we knew that back during the Obama 
administration, that actually went up. 
Our reduction—it was a reduction in 
the last 5 years—was 25 percent. At the 
same time, China went up by 83 per-
cent. So this is what is going on in the 
world today. Beijing’s budget for the 
military went up 450 percent. 
Now, you compare Beijing’s buildup 
with the rest of East Asia. At the same 
time, our core allies and partners in 
the region—that is, Japan, Australia, 
South Korea, and Taiwan—have had 
basically flat defense budgets since 
2000. Compare it with our own military 
spending. As I mentioned on the floor a 
couple of weeks ago, at the same time 
China was adding $200 billion to their 
defense budget, ours shrunk by $400 bil-
lion. 
We are certainly not provoking them 
with defense investment, and we have 
barely touched our force posture in the 
Western Pacific over the past two dec-
ades. So, if anything, our lack of ac-
tion, our lack of investment, is what is 
provoking China into thinking they 
can push around and threaten our 
friends in the region. 
The Biden administration says they 
want to take our allies and partners se-
riously. So we should listen when they 
say they are concerned about Chinese 
aggression. And they are, and the ad-
ministration knows this. I have had 
visits with the President. He is fully 
aware of that. 
Another progressive talking point is 
that the United States spends more on 
defense than the next 10 or 12 countries 
combined. Now, that is not true. The 
reality is that any honest comparison 
of numbers shows that, combined, the 
Chinese and Russians almost certainly 
spend more than us in real terms. 
China’s purchasing power is signifi-
cantly greater than ours because they 
pay their workers next to nothing and 
have much lower material costs. They 
also focus their defense spending on 
hard power. I am talking about air-
planes, tanks, ships, missiles, and the 
like. Why? Because they don’t take 
care of their people. 
People don’t understand this. At 
least 40 percent of our military budget 
goes to supporting our people. That is 
not true with any of the Communist 
countries that are out there. All they 
do, they give them the guns and say go 
out and kill people. We don’t do that. 
And 40 percent is a conservative figure. 
You remember the housing issue that 
was such a big issue; that you were 
concerned with; I was concerned with; 
we were all concerned with. That is 
something that other countries don’t 
have to worry about. China doesn’t 
worry about that. Russia doesn’t worry 
about that. These are things that—and 
yet that is almost half of our total 
budget goes to those things for our 
troops. 
We take care of our troops. The rest 
of them don’t. That is the right thing 
to do. But that is just another reason 
you can’t do a dollar-for-dollar com-
parison between the Chinese and the 
defense spending. We need a better ac-
counting. 
And incidentally, Senator ROMNEY 
introduced an amendment to our last 
year’s NDAA, military defense act, to 
get us a real comparison in spending. 
And the Pentagon owes us that report 
by October. 
Now, in October—we are going to 
talk about this. We are going to talk 
about this in our military because this 
is what the real spending is, not what 
a lot of people think that it is. All of 
this is to say, we don’t have a good 
sense of China’s true defense spending, 
but we do know it is going up. 
General McMaster called it ‘‘the 
largest peacetime military buildup in 
history.’’ 
That 
is 
what 
General 
McMaster said just the other day at 
one of our hearings. It is not just ex-
panding their military; they are mod-
ernizing and professionalizing at the 
same time. 
Secretary Austin, our Secretary of 
Defense, rightfully, calls China our 
‘‘pacing threat.’’ But here are a few of 
the ways that they have been out-
pacing us because they are investing 
where we are not investing. The Amer-
ican people think we are, but we are 
not. 
China has a 355-ship Navy. You know, 
we have been talking about that for a 
long period of time here—how we are 
going to grow to a 350-ship Navy, and 
we haven’t done it. Well, China has 
done it. They have achieved that last 
year. And while we were just talking 
about it, they were on the attack to 
get 460 ships by 2030. 
By comparison, our Navy is around 
300 ships, and it is likely to stay there 
if our defense budget doesn’t grow. 
In the air, the combatant com-
manders assess that China will have 
more fifth-generation aircraft than we 
do in the Pacific by 2025, again, the 
fifth-generation aircraft. We are down 
right now to the F–35. There are not

any others. We had the F–22. The F–22 
was our first fifth-generation fighter, 
and it was one that we were all very 
excited about. They started out want-
ing 700 of them, and we ended up with 
187, just for fiscal reasons. Again, that 
is where China is right now. That gets 
worse if we have a flat or declining 
budget here. 
China is expanding its arsenal too. 
The Pentagon’s missile experts tell us 
that China is now over 350 launchers 
for medium-range ballistic missiles, 
which are capable of hitting Guam and 
striking the U.S. warships in the Pa-
cific. 
They have produced exact copies of 
our bases, our ships, and our aircraft to 
serve as targets. And they are out 
there right now shooting those targets. 
That is us. That is America, and they 
are shooting on the replicas of our 
equipment to show that they can down 
them. By the way, they hit those tar-
gets successfully, I might add. And 
that is going on today. 
They also have thousands of short- 
range missiles. Many of those are going 
right at Taiwan. China is also dubbing 
its nuclear stockpile and completing 
their own nuclear triad. That is some-
thing that we have criticism in this 
country, that we have a triad; that is, 
three ways of deflecting nuclear at-
tacks on America. 
So that is what is going on right now. 
China’s military is charging ahead in 
just about every area. But a lot of the 
people who don’t think China is a prob-
lem—they say that none of the Chinese 
weapons are as good as ours. Well, that 
was true in 1990. That was true in the 
year 2000. That is not true anymore. 
The Office of Naval Intelligence said 
in 2015 that China’s latest surface war-
ships were comparable in many ways to 
the most modern Western ships. China 
has deployed thousands of ground-base 
missiles. We are still developing ours. 
They have fielded hypersonic strike 
weapons. We are still in the research 
and development. 
You might remember, because we 
saw that, the parade that was taking 
place in Beijing. They were dem-
onstrating that they have these weap-
ons that we don’t have. And that was 
invested a year ago. 
Just last month, the National Secu-
rity Commission on Artificial Intel-
ligence assessed that the China rate of 
investment—they will soon dominate 
us in artificial intelligence unless we 
do something different than we are cur-
rently doing. 
And while the Chinese will spend al-
most $50 billion on tech infrastructure 
over the next few years, national secu-
rity infrastructure is apparently the 
only 
thing 
that 
President 
Biden 
doesn’t consider infrastructure. 
Not only is China spending more on 
its military, but it has the tools to 
beat us. Don’t take my word for it. The 
bipartisan NDS—again, this is the doc-
ument that we have been using, and it 
has been remarkably accurate, since 
2018. That NDS Commission said, right 
in this book, the U.S. military might 
struggle to win or perhaps lose a war 
against China or Russia. That is what 
they said in 2018. And China has been 
going up ever since. 
Admiral Davidson told us the other 
week—only 2 weeks ago—that ‘‘there is 
no guarantee that the United States 
would win a future conflict with 
China.’’ 
China’s military buildup isn’t just in-
vestment for the sake of it; they are al-
ready flexing their new muscle to chal-
lenge America and American allies and 
American interests. And the PLA has 
deployed missiles, radars, stealth jet 
fighters, and bombers to islands in the 
South China Sea, claiming and milita-
rizing islands in violation of inter-
national law. 
Just last year, the PLA fired anti- 
ship ballistic missiles into the South 
China Sea, clearly practicing to target 
U.S. Navy ships in the area. And that is 
what they are doing today. Those are 
Chinese troops walking on Woody Is-
land in the South China Sea. And the 
PLA has been expanding its network of 
strategic ports and bases around the 
world from Djibouti to Pakistan and 
Cambodia and Sri Lanka and else-
where. 
Last year, China started going after 
the territory of India, which has re-
sulted in dozens of dead Indian soldiers. 
They have continually harassed Japan 
and Taiwan in the air and on the sea. 
Their fishing fleets have terrorized 
small Pacific island nations. Over 200 
Chinese boats are staking out a reef in 
the South China Sea claimed by the 
Philippines. 
China has just completed a new sat-
ellite constellation over Taiwan that 
allows for almost constant coverage of 
the island, the highest known fre-
quency of satellite coverage in the 
world. 
A few weeks ago, Taiwan reported 
the largest ever Chinese incursion 
when 25 combat aircraft flew into its 
airspace. And as the cochair of the Tai-
wan Caucus, this is of specific concern 
to me. Some people have forgotten that 
aggression by nation states is not a 
thing of the past. People have forgot-
ten how costly it is when deterrence 
fails. 
That is why I am arguing for sus-
tained real growth in the defense budg-
et. We know it is necessary. We know 
that it is attainable because the burden 
of defense spending on the economy 
today is half what it was at the height 
of the Cold War. 
The Biden administration is trying 
to tell us that we can invest in eco-
nomic and technological competition 
or the military competition. That is a 
false choice. We have to do the mili-
tary. 
The reality is, the Chinese are en-
gaged in every dimension of this com-
petition, especially the military di-
mension, and they are not going to 
stop anytime soon. 
I would have to say, do we really 
want to be there for our allies or part-
ners? Do we want our children and 
grandchildren to live in a world where 
our status of leader of the free world is 
in name only? 
You know, my wife and I have been 
married for 61 years. We have 20 kids 
and grandkids so I have a stake in this 
thing. I have a real concern. Do we 
want them, these kids, to grow up in a 
world where China—the same country 
that is committing genocide against 
the Uighurs, silencing free speech, and 
jailing activists in Hong Kong—gets to 
set the rules of international engage-
ment? 
This isn’t a hypothetical question. 
That is a question that we are answer-
ing each year when we set our military 
budget, and, frankly, I am disappointed 
in how the current administration is 
answering that call. 
We have to be prepared to take on 
China from all angles of national 
power. And this begins with adequate 
resourcing of our U.S. military with 
real growth in the defense budget. 
It is kind of a myth floating around. 
I know every time I give a speech 
someplace in the State of Oklahoma or 
elsewhere, there is a kind of an as-
sumption that we in the United States 
have the best of everything. And fol-
lowing World War II, that was true, but 
that isn’t true today. And if America 
chooses to sit on the sidelines in this 
competition, and we ask our allies and 
partners to face China alone, the fail-
ure of military deterrence becomes 
more likely. And that is an outcome 
that nobody there or here wants. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTION INTEGRITY 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, it wasn’t 
enough for Democrats like Stacey 
Abrams and President Biden to lie 
about the new Georgia voting law. 
Now, today, CHUCK SCHUMER is sending 
his lawyers to swarm Montana court-
rooms and has taken to the Senate 
floor with more distortion. 
This time, it is about Montana’s new 
voting laws. 
I have a message for Leader SCHUMER 
and the Democrats who are trying to 
distort the facts and the will of Mon-
tana voters: Please get your facts 
straight. In Montana we are putting in 
place some commonsense reforms that 
enjoy the strong support of Montanans. 
Why is the leader so determined to 
strike down commonsense efforts to 
provide integrity and transparency to 
our elections? 
Let’s talk about voter ID. A majority 
of Americans support needing a photo 
ID to cast a ballot. According to the 
Honest Elections Project, 77 percent of 
Americans support needing a photo ID

April 20, 2021 
to vote—77 percent. Why? Because it is 
common sense and because you need a 
photo ID to do many tasks, some quite 
mundane. You need a photo ID to get a 
hunting or fishing license. You need a 
photo ID to rent a hotel room, to drive 
a car, to rent a car, to get on an air-
plane, to pick up tickets at will call. If 
these simple tasks require a valid ID, 
shouldn’t protecting the integrity of 
America’s election process require at 
least the same? 
This isn’t the first time Leader SCHU-
MER and the Democrats have tried to 
stick their nose into Montana’s busi-
ness and tried to overturn the will of 
Montana voters. In fact, this past elec-
tion, dark money groups backed by 
CHUCK SCHUMER pushed to loosen elec-
tion standards, such as ballot har-
vesting, in Montana, and they won. 
This is despite the fact that nearly 
two-thirds of Montana voters passed a 
law to prohibit ballot harvesting. 
How is this listening to Montanans? 
It is not. 
Montanans want election integrity. 
They want to trust their elections. Yet 
Leader SCHUMER continues to under-
mine their direct appeal to put com-
monsense practices in place. 
In Montana we want everyone legally 
allowed to vote to be able to, and we 
want there to be zero doubt that those 
votes should count. All Montanans— 
Republicans, Democrats, Independents, 
Libertarians—should have faith in our 
elections. 
Montana’s legislature, Montana Sec-
retary of State Christi Jacobsen, and 
Montana 
Governor 
Greg 
Gianforte 
wanted to strengthen this trust, and 
that is what they did with these com-
monsense bills. 
The distortion by Democrats in this 
country is eroding this trust. This 
must stop. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come to the floor today to just 
say a brief word and maybe set the 
record straight a little bit about Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee for Associate At-
torney General of the United States, 
Vanita Gupta. 
Let’s start with some facts about Ms. 
Gupta. She is the daughter of immi-
grants who worked hard to receive 
some of the best legal education this 
country has to offer. She spent 2 dec-
ades as a civil rights lawyer, where she 
has fought to defend Americans’ indi-
vidual 
rights 
and 
freedoms, 
often 
against abuses by the government, 
something you would think some of my 
colleagues on the other side would ap-
preciate. 
When a small town in Texas wrong-
fully convicted 40 Americans of drug 
charges, based solely on the false testi-
mony from an undercover police offi-
cer, she fought to have them exoner-
ated, and she won them a $6 million 
settlement for that miscarriage of jus-
tice. 
She defended 25 children who had 
been separated from their parents and 
thrown into prison-like conditions at a 
private detention center in Texas. Her 
success in that case forced the center 
to improve its conditions and pre-
vented more kids from being held 
there. 
President Obama recognized her lead-
ership by making her the top civil 
rights official at the Department of 
Justice, where she protected service-
members from eviction, cracked down 
on human smugglers and sex traf-
fickers, defended religious freedom, 
and protected Americans’ fundamental 
right to vote. 
Over the past 4 years, Ms. Gupta has 
led the largest civil rights organization 
in America, where she has been at the 
forefront of efforts to reform our crimi-
nal justice system, strengthen our de-
mocracy, and make sure COVID relief 
reaches those who need it most. 
That is her record. It is an out-
standing record. I think my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle know that 
it is an outstanding record because 
they don’t want to contend with her 
record. They don’t want to contest her 
record. They can’t defeat her nomina-
tion with the truth. So they are just 
using talking points that aren’t true. 
I heard the junior Senator from 
Texas say Ms. Gupta’s record ‘‘is that 
of an extreme partisan ideologue.’’ He 
called her ‘‘an extreme political activ-
ist,’’ a ‘‘radical,’’ and a ‘‘zealot,’’ when 
all she has done her entire career is up-
hold the rule of law and defend our de-
mocracy, just like the 60 judges, many 
of them confirmed by Republican col-
leagues, 
who 
rejected 
President 
Trump’s 
utterly 
unsubstantiated 
claims of fraud in the 2020 election; 
just like the election officials who 
stood up to conspiracy theories about 
the election at great risk to themselves 
and to their careers, who were all un-
dermined by radical Members of Con-
gress who sought to overturn the will 
of the voters for their own power. 
I also heard the junior Senator from 
Texas say Ms. Gupta’s beliefs ‘‘don’t 
align with the majority of the Amer-
ican people.’’ I am willing to bet every 
single dollar in my pocket that most 
Americans are quite aligned with Ms. 
Gupta’s views. 
Most Americans are very interested 
in having a Department of Justice that 
protects their right to vote, that keeps 
families together and kids out of pris-
on-like conditions, to make sure that 
LGBT sons and daughters and neigh-
bors can live free from discrimination. 
I will tell you one other thing. Un-
like some people around this place, Ms. 
Gupta actually has a record of reaching 
across the aisle to get things done. She 
worked with Grover Norquist and the 
top lawyer for the Koch brothers to 
pass criminal justice reform. It is why 
they both endorsed her, along with 
President Bush’s former Secretary of 
Homeland 
Security, 
and 
virtually 
every major law enforcement organiza-
tion in America, including the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the National 
Sheriffs’ Association, the Major Coun-
ty Sheriffs of America, and the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association. 
So it is hard to take seriously all this 
talk on the other side about how Ms. 
Gupta wants to ‘‘defund the police.’’ 
She has never supported that. When 
someone asked the head of the Fra-
ternal Order of Police what he thought 
about these attacks, he called it ‘‘par-
tisan demagoguery.’’ And that is ex-
actly what it is, and he is right. 
There isn’t a serious debate about 
her record. It is a political campaign to 
defeat her nomination. The American 
people see through it, and I hope my 
colleagues will see through it as well. 
We would be lucky to have someone 
with Ms. Gupta’s experience and lead-
ership at the Department of Justice. 
Many years ago, I had the privilege 
to work at the Department, and I know 
how seriously the men and women 
there take their jobs, and I know how 
grateful they would be to serve along-
side someone as talented and com-
mitted to the mission as Ms. Gupta. It 
is why I believe tomorrow we should 
come to this floor and give her a re-
sounding bipartisan vote to confirm 
her as the next Associate Attorney 
General of the United States. 
I urge all of my colleagues to put 
aside the rhetoric and the false claims. 
Look at the record for what it is. The 
police organizations have supported 
her. And vote yes for her nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
HONORING STATE PATROL 
SERGEANT JIM SMITH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
on April 13, I delivered remarks on the 
Senate Floor to share my condolences 
for Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Jim 
Smith, who lost his life in the line of 
duty. I was honored to attend Sergeant 
Smith’s funeral on April 16 in Inde-
pendence. Jim Smith was revered as a 
man of strong convictions, love of fam-
ily, and deep-rooted faith. Iowa State 
Patrol Colonel Nathan Fulk gave the 
following eulogy in honor of Sergeant 
Smith. I ask unanimous consent that 
the eulogy be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
COL. NATHAN FULK REMARKS AT THE FUNERAL 
FOR SGT. JAMES SMITH 
I’m going to ask all of you here today to do 
something for Jim Smith. I’m going to ask 
you to do something for Jim Smith’s wife, 
Kathy, his son, Zander, and his daughter, 
Jazlyn. And what we’re asking you to do 
today is to open your minds and your hearts 
to the Lord Jesus Christ. His presence is here 
today. Jim Smith is here with us today. 
Our faith teaches us that in our suffering 
God is with us. Jim’s priorities were faith, 
family, and his commitment to public serv-
ice and his community. During a time in his-
tory when we wonder—with conflict, adver-
sity, and challenge, we can doubt the support 
we have in society. However, the outpouring 
of support for the City of Independence has 
been truly amazing. You’ve reminded us why 
we love working, serving, and living in the 
state of Iowa. You’ve reminded us why we 
have a strong passion to serve and protect 
those in the community. And you’ve shown 
us that love, compassion, and respect are 
true Iowa values. 
This senseless and tragic loss is difficult 
for everyone here today. Our Department of 
Public Safety family, our Iowa State Patrol 
Family, you know we’re hurting but we’re 
not broken. We are struggling but we’re not 
lost. And we’re deeply saddened but we will 
work to find peace in the days ahead. Com-
missioner Stephan Bayens and I are ex-
tremely proud of the work you do each and 
every day. His expectation for our leaders is 
we take the absolute best care of our per-
sonnel. Rest assured that we are here for you 
and we will keep you in our thoughts and 
prayers. 
We will remain committed to serving 
Iowans with integrity, fairness, respect, hon-
esty, courage, and compassion. This will be 
vital to our healing process and into the fu-
ture. We are here for our troopers, our spe-
cial agents, our communication specialists, 
our local law enforcement partners, and our 
first responders. We must navigate through 
this together, day by day, and week by week. 
We’re going to continue to do our job and 
we’re going to do it well. We’re going to do 
it with confidence, professionalism, and in-
tegrity. We will work together to establish a 
pathway to heal while we honor Sgt. Jim 
Smith’s sacrifice and his legacy. 
Jim’s faith and family was the foundation 
of his life. He loved being an Iowa State 
Trooper, but his job did not define who he 
was. What defined him was his family, his 
faith, and his true love for others. Sergeant 
Jim Smith worked for the State Patrol for 
twenty-seven and a half years, and twenty- 
five years on our tactical unit. During that 
time, he served as a team leader. And he was 
a humble man with a tremendous work 
ethic. Jim loved his job and he set an excel-
lent example for others to follow. He men-
tioned how his parents provided him impor-
tant qualities of hard work and determina-
tion that led to his success. He provided 
strong leadership in District Ten, alongside 
Lt. Senne, Sgt. O’Rear, and Sgt. Trimble. 
They all speak highly of his character, his 
integrity, and his commitment to do the 
right thing for the right reason. I learned 
this week that Jim’s biggest vice was choco-
late milk. Chocolate milk was a treat for 
him when he accomplished something spe-
cial. I’m sure most of us in this room today 
wish chocolate milk was our biggest vice. 
This just speaks of Jim’s character and who 
he was. 
On the Area C Tactical Team for the Iowa 
State Patrol, he was extremely experienced 
in handling high-risk calls. He had quiet con-
fidence that provided reassurance to the 
Area C Tactical Unit. This quiet confidence 
exhibited as ‘we got this.’ Jim was a 
sheepdog, that protected sheep. He always 
wanted to be the number one man in the 
door. This was his struggle with becoming a 
team leader on the tactical team, was he 
would have to give up that number one posi-
tion. Jim’s wife, Kathy, recently mentioned 
to the State Patrol staff why he wanted to be 
the first to the door, and she now under-
stands it. His priority was to protect his peo-
ple. 
Captain Olmstead and several other leaders 
in the organization challenged Jim to put in 
for a supervisory position. He struggled with 
this. Jim would politely decline and say, ‘‘I 
love taking bad guys to jail and working the 
road.’’ And he did it well. He felt that if he 
was promoted to become a supervisor he- 
couldn’t do his road enforcement responsibil-
ities, to protect and serve. One day Jim 
called Captain Olmstead and said he thought 
it was time to take on the leadership and su-
pervisory position. He knew he needed to 
mentor young troopers, to show them what a 
work ethic and a commitment to the organi-
zation and to the State of Iowa meant to 
him. He went on to be promoted to sergeant 
and continue to do what he loved while men-
toring, leading by examples, and encouraging 
troopers to work hard each and every day. 
Jim was an extremely humble person that 
strove for excellence in his work, was strong 
in his faith, and he walked in Jesus’ foot-
steps. He recently provided a sermon at 
church entitled Act Your Age. He brought in 
a Superman lunchbox and began to share the 
food that his wife, Kathy, had prepared for 
him. Jim pulled out an apple and he said 
that he asked his wife, Kathy, to pack him a 
Twinkie. He said Kathy reminded him that 
‘‘we’re not on a diet, we’re just making 
healthy life choices.’’ But during that ser-
mon he had a powerful message, a message 
he wants you to hear today. Jim said, ‘‘I 
want my kids to know what’s good and 
true.’’ He spoke of sacrificial love and that 
children are adorable little creatures of God. 
He said that ‘‘my kids fill my life with love.’’ 
His correlation with that sermon was that 
God sees us as the children he created. You 
are a child of God, act your age. He closed 
with, ‘‘Cherish God, know that God loves 
you, God still sees you as a child he created. 
So go to him as a child, depend on him, love 
him, and seek to be loved by him.’’ It was a 
very captivating message he shared. 
Family was extremely important to Jim. 
He often spoke of his wife, Kathy, and he 
loved you deeply. He spoke of his son, Zan-
der, and his daughter, Jazlyn. He loved you 
two very much. He loved spending time with 
both of you and telling stories to all the 
troopers about the trips you took and the 
quality time you spent together. And that 
meant the world to him. He often spoke to 
the troopers—he was trying to be a good role 
model and a good father, and spoke of the 
dreams he had for both of you two. He want-
ed to be a good example for you. He wanted 
to lead you down a path of faith and to set 
you up for success in life. You both made 
him an extremely proud father. 
I’ve been struggling to find the right words 
to comfort us all today. As we walk through 
this together, seeking to find a sense of pur-
pose and a sense of peace, I don’t have to 
look for those words because Jim left them 
for us. These handwritten words are from 
Jim. They were in his Bible, and Kathy pro-
vided them to us this week. The words were, 
‘‘Don’t just know, do. Live in service. Know 
the goal, finish strong. Teach with applica-
tion. Don’t just tell, show. Don’t just learn, 
do. Live out God’s word. Live out faith. 
Teach, take care of our family, but also 
change the world.’’

1 Peter 2:21 says, ‘‘For God called you to do 
good, even if it means suffering, just as 
Christ suffered for you. He is your example 
and you must follow in his footsteps.’’ You 
know, reflecting on Jim’s life has impacted 
us all this week. It has impacted me and 
challenged me to think about being the best 
person I can be. So I’ve asked myself some 
tough questions. Am I following in Jesus 
Christ’s footsteps? Am I following in Jim 
Smith’s footsteps? Can I be a man that cares 
for my community like Jim Smith cared for 
this community? Can I be a man that loves 
my children like Jim Smith loved Zander 
and Jazlyn? Can I be a man that loves my 
wife like Jim loved his wife, Kathy? And can 
I be a man that loves the Lord Jesus Christ, 
like Jim Smith loved the Lord, his God? We 
love you Jim, we will see you again.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHEPLER 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor John Shepler, an 
outstanding public servant who has 
served both my office and the citizens 
of West Virginia well in his 21-year ca-
reer with the Internal Revenue Service. 
John is retiring from his position as 
taxpayer advocate in order to spend 
more time with his family and enjoy 
the next stage of his life. 
During his 10 years as taxpayer advo-
cate, John was a valuable resource to 
my office and West Virginia’s citizens. 
He was well informed, quick to re-
spond, and straightforward in his deal-
ings as he advocated on behalf of his 
clients. He was a dedicated employee, 
fully committed to his many respon-
sibilities. He was a pleasure to work 
with, and my staff were always con-
fident that John was providing top- 
level service, regardless of the issue. 
John also served his country through 
his military service with the U.S. Air 
Force, serving 6 years as a missile fa-
cilities specialist. A dedicated public 
servant, John has served his country 
and 
his 
community 
continually 
throughout his adult life. 
John is the proud parent of daughter 
and a son, living in Little Hocking, OH, 
and Houston, TX, respectively. I am 
sure he is looking forward to spending 
more time with his five grandchildren, 
as well as with his favorite pastimes: 
hunting deer and turkey, fishing, and 
camping. 
I would like to thank John for his 
service and wish him well in his next 
phase of life. My staff will miss work-
ing with him at the IRS, but we are all 
happy that we had him as long as we 
did to provide excellent service to the 
citizens of West Virginia. Good Luck, 
John. Thank you again for your com-
mitment to our State.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING AUSTIN SORENSEN 
KLEIN 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the life and memory of 
Austin Sorensen Klein, a son, younger 
brother, and friend gone too soon. Aus-
tin’s loved ones remember him as a 
young man full of energy, talent, and 
passion for trying and conquering new 
things. 
Austin loved to sing. He was known 
throughout the Overland Park commu-
nity as a vocal talent. After winning 
the 2015 KC Superstar competition, he 
went on to pursue music through the 
men’s glee club at the University of 
Notre Dame and then the a cappella 
group at the University of Texas-Aus-
tin. Anyone who knew Austin and 
heard him sing will remember his sono-
rous voice and how his joy for music 
was contagious. 
Austin was a kind, intelligent, pa-
tient young man who loved to learn 
and loved even more to make people 
laugh. He was a reader and, in many 
ways, a budding philosopher. Austin 
enjoyed traveling with his close fam-
ily; they hiked the Black Hills and Yel-
lowstone, toured Disney World and 
Washington, DC, and explored Europe, 
Australia, and New Zealand together. I 
know his parents Greg and Sue, who 
are dear friends to me and Senator 
THUNE, and his brothers Kevin and 
Keith will treasure these memories for-
ever. Our community hurts with them 
as they navigate life without their be-
loved son and brother. 
After a brief but remarkable life, 
Austin passed away on March 3, 2021. I 
want to extend my sincerest condo-
lences to the Klein family and Austin’s 
friends who mourn as they miss and re-
member Austin’s voice, his laugh, and 
the joy he brought to everyone he 
knew. May we all learn from Austin’s 
example to live every day to the full-
est, hold close those who are dear to 
us, and do the things we love most.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–6. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the 
Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutri-
tion Service to include certain nonfood es-
sentials in the supplemental nutrition assist-
ance program; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
SENATE PAPER 312 
Whereas, the Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program, or SNAP, is a federally 
governed and funded program under the 
United States Department of Agriculture, 
Food and Nutrition Service with shared 
state administration; and 
Whereas, SNAP currently provides nutri-
tion benefits to supplement the food budget 
of qualifying recipients so they can purchase 
healthy food but fails to account for nonfood 
essentials, including toilet paper, soap, deo-
dorant, toothpaste and menstrual products; 
and 
Whereas, toilet paper, soap, deodorant, 
toothpaste and menstrual products are es-
sential products needed for human dignity 
and health; and 
Whereas, if a person struggles with access 
to food, that person likely also struggles 
with access to nonfood essentials; and 
Whereas, a person who does not have ac-
cess to nonfood essentials, especially men-
strual products and toilet paper, may be 
forced to use inappropriate and unsafe alter-
natives, thereby putting that person’s health 
and the health of the person’s reproductive 
system at risk; and 
Whereas, a person without access to 
nonfood essentials cannot equitably partici-
pate in work, the search for employment or 
many other activities due to the risk of em-
barrassment such as from odors or bleeding 
through clothing; and 
Whereas, a person who lives in an abusive 
situation has an increased likelihood of hav-
ing difficulty accessing menstrual products 
and other nonfood essentials; and 
Whereas, it is a matter of human justice 
and dignity for recipients of SNAP benefits 
to be granted the authority to determine 
what essentials they most need; and 
Whereas, the residents of this State who 
qualify for SNAP benefits have essential 
needs beyond food and should therefore be 
granted the dignity to select how to expend 
their SNAP benefits based upon their essen-
tial needs; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Food and 
Nutrition Service enter into rulemaking to 
amend the stated goal of SNAP to ‘‘raising 
the level of nutrition and essential-need sta-
bility among low-income households and 
maintaining adequate levels of nutrition and 
nonfood-essentials supplies by increasing the 
food 
and 
nonfood-essentials 
purchasing 
power of low-income families’’; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Food and 
Nutrition Service enter into rulemaking to 
expand the scope of SNAP benefits to include 
the following nonfood essentials for recipient 
purchase: toilet paper, soap, deodorant, 
toothpaste and menstrual products, includ-
ing but not limited to tampons, pads, liners 
and reusable cups, underwear and shields; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Joseph R. Biden, President of the United 
States, for consideration in the federal budg-
eting process; to the Secretary of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Food and 
Nutrition Service; to the Nutrition Service 
Administrator, United States Department of 
Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service; to 
the Food and Nutrition Service Associate 
Administrator of the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program, United States De-
partment of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition 
Service; to the Northeast Regional Office of 
the United States Department of Agri-
culture, Food and Nutrition Service; to the 
President of the United States Senate; to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives of 
the United States; to each Member of the 
Maine Congressional Delegation; and to the 
Maine Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
POM–7. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to eliminate the Windfall 
Elimination Provision that penalizes Maine 
state retirees; to the Committee on Finance. 
SENATE PAPER 332 
Whereas, under current federal law, indi-
viduals who receive a Social Security benefit 
and a public retirement benefit derived from 
employment not covered under Social Secu-
rity are subject to a reduction in the Social 
Security benefits; and 
Whereas, these laws, contained in the fed-
eral Social Security Act, 42 United States 
Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter II, Federal Old- 
Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance 
Benefits, and known as the Government Pen-
sion Offset and the Windfall Elimination 
Provision, greatly affect public employees, 
particularly women; and 
Whereas, the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion reduces by a formula the Social Secu-
rity benefit of a person who is also receiving 
a pension from a public employer that does 
not participate in Social Security; and 
Whereas, the Government Pension Offset 
and the Windfall Elimination Provision are 
particularly burdensome on the finances of 
low-income 
and 
moderate-income 
public 
service workers, such as school teachers, 
clerical workers and school cafeteria em-
ployees, whose wages are low to start; and 
Whereas, the Government Pension Offset 
and the Windfall Elimination Provision both 
unfairly reduce benefits for those public em-
ployees and their spouses whose careers 
cross the line between the private and public 
sectors; and 
Whereas, since many lower-paying public 
service jobs are held by women, both the 
Government Pension Offset and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision have a disproportion-
ately adverse effect on women; and 
Whereas, in some cases, additional support 
in the form of income, housing, heating and 
prescription drug and other safety net assist-
ance from state and local governments is 
needed to make up for the reductions im-
posed at the federal level; and 
Whereas, other participants in Social Se-
curity do not have their benefits reduced in 
this manner; and 
Whereas, to participate or not to partici-
pate in Social Security in public sector em-
ployment is a decision of employers, even 
though both the Government Pension Offset 
and the Windfall Elimination Provision di-
rectly punish employees and their spouses; 
and 
Whereas, although the Government Pen-
sion Offset was enacted in 1977 and the Wind-
fall Elimination Provision was enacted in 
1983, many of the benefits in dispute were 
paid into Social Security prior to that time; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the Presi-
dent of the United States and the Congress 
of the United States work together to sup-
port reform proposals that include the fol-
lowing protections for low-income and mod-
erate-income government retirees: 
1. Protections permitting retention of a 
combined public pension and Social Security 
benefit with no applied reductions; 
2. Protections permanently ensuring that 
level of benefit by indexing it to inflation; 
and 
3. Protections ensuring that no current re-
cipient’s benefit is reduced by the reform 
legislation; and be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United 
States; the President of the United States 
Senate; the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives; and each Member 
of the Maine Congressional Delegation. 
POM–8. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States to establish a national in-
frastructure bank; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE PAPER 297 
Whereas, the American Society of Civil 
Engineers states in its 2017 Report Card that 
the United States received a grade of D+ re-
garding the current state of infrastructure 
and that more than $4.5 trillion would be 
needed to restore the nation’s infrastructure 
to a state of good repair, over $2 trillion in 
new infrastructure projects is currently not 
funded by the Federal Government and the 
remainder of infrastructure projects is inad-
equately funded; and 
Whereas, the Maine Section of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers gave the 
State a grade of C¥ in 2020, including dams, 
D+; hazardous waste, D+; roads, D; transit, 
D+; and wastewater, D+; and 
Whereas,

the pandemic related to coronavirus disease 
2019 and preexisting financial deficits; driv-
ers in the State spend over $1 billion per year 
in vehicle operating costs, congestion and 
crashes, and the Stale has the highest high-
way fatality rate in New England; and the 
State has 1,073 dams with an average age of 
over 100 years, and a minimum of $269 mil-
lion is needed to maintain dam infrastruc-
ture; and 
Whereas, a new National Infrastructure 
Bank could directly help finance all of these 
projects, and the United States Congress in-
troduced H.R. 6422, ‘‘National Infrastructure 
Bank Act of 2020,’’ which would create a $4 
trillion bank that could help finance the in-
frastructure needs and hire millions who 
have lost their jobs during the pandemic, 
putting them into higher-paying infrastruc-
ture and related jobs; and 
Whereas, the new National Infrastructure 
Bank is modeled on previous successful, 
similar institutions that built much of the 
nation’s infrastructure, and under United 
States Presidents George Washington, James 
Madison, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt similar institutions financed the 
infrastructure projects that made us the 
envy of the world and helped bring us out of 
the Great Depression and win World War II; 
and 
Whereas, the new National Infrastructure 
Bank will be capitalized by using secure, ex-
isting United States Treasury debt, such as 
treasury bills typically held in large quan-
tities by major investment institutions, re-
quiring no new federal spending and no new 
taxes, and will be authorized to spend $4 tril-
lion 
in 
urgently 
needed 
infrastructure 
projects; and 
Whereas, the new National Infrastructure 
Bank will create approximately 25 million 
new jobs, ensure the payment of fair wages, 
mandate project labor agreements, ensure 
‘‘buy American’’ policies, direct spending 
into disadvantaged business enterprises and 
ensure minority hiring opportunities, and it 
is expected to increase the size of the econ-
omy by 4% to 5% each year; and 
Whereas, the new National Infrastructure 
Bank is supported by many organizations: 
Seventeen state legislatures have introduced 
or passed resolutions, city and county coun-
cils have introduced or passed resolutions 
and the National Congress of Black Women, 
National Association of Counties, the United 
States High Speed Rail Association, the Na-
tional Federation of Federal Employees, the 
American Sustainable Business Council, the 
National Association of Minority Contrac-
tors, the National Latino Farmers and 
Ranchers Trade Association and many other 
government, labor and civic bodies have en-
dorsed the National Infrastructure Bank leg-
islation; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the Con-
gress of the United States pass, and the 
President of the United States sign, H.R. 6422 
to create a National Infrastructure Bank to 
finance 
urgently 
needed 
infrastructure 
projects; and he it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives and each Member 
of the Maine Congressional Delegation. 
POM–9. A resolution adopted by the Senate 
of the State of Michigan urging the United 
States Congress to change the formula for 
distributing coronavirus emergency relief 
funds for schools to allow states to dis-
tribute funds on a more equitable basis; to 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 24 
Whereas, The COVID–19 pandemic has had 
a dramatic impact on schools, students, and 
teachers across the country. Schools have 
needed to make significant investments to 
first ensure all students had equal access to 
remote learning and then to ensure schools 
could provide a safe learning environment 
for students returning to in-person learning; 
and 
Whereas, Congress has approved emergency 
relief funding to assist schools in addressing 
impacts from the COVID–19 pandemic. Under 
the recent Coronavirus Response and Relief 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021, the 
state of Michigan will receive more than 
$1.65 billion. The state must distribute at 
least $1.49 billion of these funds to local 
schools, while Congress continues to debate 
providing even more emergency funding for 
schools; and 
Whereas, The current federal formula for 
distributing emergency relief funding has led 
to large discrepancies in how much schools 
receive per pupil. The Elementary and Sec-
ondary 
School 
Emergency 
Relief 
Fund 
(ESSER II Fund), and the earlier ESSER I 
funding, must be allocated to schools based 
on the formula under Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965. Under this complicated formula based 
on the number of disadvantaged and low-in-
come students and other factors, it is esti-
mated that some school districts in Michi-
gan could receive as little $51 per pupil while 
other districts could receive more than 
$16,481 per pupil in addition to their founda-
tion allowance; and 
Whereas, The COVID–19 pandemic has im-
pacted school systems across the state with 
unexpected and impossible to plan for ex-
penses. All school systems have needed to in-
vest in technology and equipment to ensure 
Michigan’s children could continue to learn 
remotely and allow schools to provide a safe 
environment for students and teachers in the 
classroom. Schools with more disadvantaged 
and low-income students have had additional 
challenges in creating remote and safe in- 
person learning environments. However, the 
Title I, Part A formula is an imperfect and 
inadequate solution that has led to an ab-
surd inequity in the distribution of emer-
gency relief funds; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-
alize the Congress of the United States to 
change 
the 
formula 
for 
distributing 
coronavirus 
emergency 
relief 
funds 
for 
schools to allow states to distribute funds on 
a more equitable basis; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
Michigan congressional delegation. 
POM–10. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota clarifying the 1975 ratification by the 
44th Legislative Assembly of the proposed 
1972 Equal Rights Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States only was valid 
through March 22, 1979; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4010 
Whereas, the 92nd Congress of the United 
States of America, during its second session, 
with the constitutionally required vote of 
two-thirds of both houses, on March 22, 1972, 
gave final approval to House Joint Resolu-
tion No. 208, commonly referred to as the 
Equal Rights Amendment, to propose the 
amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, pursuant to Article V of the 
Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, in offering the proposed federal 
constitutional 
amendment 
to 
America’s 
state lawmakers, the 92nd Congress chose a 
deadline of 7 years, or until March 22, 1979, 
for the constitutionally mandated ratifica-
tion of the amendment by three-fourths of 
the country’s state legislatures; and 
Whereas, in Senate Concurrent Resolution 
No. 4007, the regular session of the 44th Leg-
islative Assembly in 1975, responded by rati-
fying the proposed 1972 Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of North Dakota, 
the House of Representatives Concurring 
Therein: 
That the 67th Legislative Assembly deems 
that the vitality of Senate Concurrent Reso-
lution No. 4007 of the 44th Legislative Assem-
bly by which North Dakota lawmakers rati-
fied the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment, offi-
cially lapsed at 11:59 p.m. on March 22, 1979; 
and be if further 
Resolved, That, after March 22, 1979, the 
Legislative Assembly, while in agreement 
women and men should enjoy equal rights in 
the eyes of the law, should not be counted by 
Congress, the Archivist of the United States, 
lawmakers in any other state, any court of 
law, or any other person, as still having on 
record a live ratification of the proposed 
Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States as was offered by 
House Joint Resolution No. 208 of the 92nd 
Congress on March 22, 1972; and be it further 
Resolved, That the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the full and com-
plete verbatim text of this resolution be duly 
published in the United States Senate’s por-
tion of the Congressional Record, as an offi-
cial memorial to the United States Senate, 
and that this resolution be referred to the 
committee of the United States Senate with 
appropriate jurisdiction over its subject 
matter; and be it further 
Resolved, That the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the substance of 
this resolution be duly entered in the United 
States House of Representatives’ portion of 
the Congressional Record, as an official me-
morial to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and that this resolution be re-
ferred to the committee of the United States 
House of Representatives with appropriate 
jurisdiction over its subject matter; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Vice 
President of the United States, the secretary 
and parliamentarian of the United States 
Senate; the Speaker, clerk, and parliamen-
tarian of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives; each member of the North Da-
kota Congressional Delegation; and the Ar-
chivist of the United States at the National 
Archives and Records Administration in 
Washington, D.C. 
POM–11. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio 
urging the federal government to increase 
the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
program’s security against fraudulent ac-
tors, both internationally and domestically; 
to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 21 
Whereas, The rate of unemployment fraud 
is skyrocketing in Ohio and around the coun-
try, and we can no longer afford to freely 
hand out taxpayer dollars without some kind 
of security measures against fraud; and 
Whereas, The unemployment compensa-
tion system is a federal-state partnership; 
and 
Whereas, Part of the partnership between 
the federal government and the State of Ohio 
is that Ohio will ensure prompt payment of 
both state unemployment benefits and bene-
fits under the Pandemic Unemployment As-
sistance program; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2067 
April 20, 2021 
Whereas, While we are in an unprecedented 
pandemic, and there is great need for expedi-
ency when processing unemployment claims, 
there must be some form of security check 
to prevent claims from being made in our 
constituents’ names without their knowl-
edge or consent; and 
Whereas, The federal attitude of ‘‘pay and 
chase,’’ meaning the overemphasis on expe-
diting benefit payments without traditional 
safeguards, 
must 
be 
re-evaluated 
and 
changed; and 
Whereas, Across the country, regardless of 
whether these fraudulent claims are through 
states’ traditional unemployment systems or 
the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
program, taxpayer dollars are being siphoned 
off by domestic criminals and international 
thieves; and 
Whereas, This fraud deprives our state and 
federal governments of necessary resources 
during a pandemic and costs our constitu-
ents money; and 
Whereas, This fraud slows down the proc-
ess by which unemployment benefits are dis-
tributed to those who are truly in need with-
in our communities; and 
Whereas, Instituting a system that stamps 
out fraud and theft will clear the way for re-
sources to flow where they are needed more 
quickly and efficiently; and 
Whereas, Ohioans who receive 1099–G tax 
forms for unemployment benefits that they 
did not receive must navigate a cumbersome, 
frustrating, and unresponsive system to 
clear the fraud status from their account; 
now therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
134th General Assembly of the State of Ohio, 
urge the federal government to reinstitute 
the traditional safeguards as well as new 
identification verification to ensure that the 
individuals requesting and receiving benefits 
under the Pandemic Unemployment Assist-
ance program are those who truly need it, 
and not fraudulent actors; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate 
transmit duly authenticated copies of this 
resolution to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent Pro Tempore and Secretary of the 
United States Senate, each member of the 
Ohio Congressional delegation, the U.S. Sec-
retary of Labor, and the news media of Ohio.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. 
YOUNG, Ms. HASSAN, Ms. COLLINS, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. PORTMAN, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mr. GRAHAM, Mr. PETERS, Mr. 
BLUNT, Mr. DAINES, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Mr. ROMNEY, and Mr. KELLY): 
S. 1260. A bill to establish a new Di-
rectorate for Technology and Innova-
tion in the National Science Founda-
tion, to establish a regional technology 
hub program, to require a strategy and 
report on economic security, science, 
research, innovation, manufacturing, 
and job creation, to establish a critical 
supply chain resiliency program, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1260 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Endless 
Frontier Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) For over 70 years, the United States has 
been the unequivocal global leader in sci-
entific and technological innovation, and as 
a result the people of the United States have 
benefitted through good-paying jobs, eco-
nomic prosperity, and a higher quality of 
life. 
(A) Today, however, this leadership posi-
tion is being eroded and challenged by for-
eign competitors, some of which are stealing 
intellectual property and trade secrets of the 
United States and aggressively investing in 
research and commercialization to dominate 
the key existing and future technology 
fields. 
(B) While the United States once led the 
world in the share of our economy invested 
in research, our Nation now ranks 9th glob-
ally in total research and development and 
12th in publicly financed research and devel-
opment. 
(C) While wages for American workers rose 
in parallel with growth in national produc-
tivity from the end of World War II through 
most of the 1970s, since then wage growth 
has been uneven and labor’s share in na-
tional income has declined. 
(2) Without a significant increase in in-
vestment in research, education, technology 
transfer, intellectual property, manufac-
turing, and other core strengths of the 
United States innovation ecosystem, it is 
only a matter of time before the global com-
petitors of the United States overtake the 
United States in terms of technological pri-
macy. The country that wins the race in key 
technologies—such as artificial intelligence, 
quantum computing, advanced communica-
tions, 
and 
advanced 
manufacturing—and 
uses technological innovation to support 
high-quality jobs and incomes will be the su-
perpower of the future. 
(3) The Federal Government must catalyze 
United States innovation by boosting re-
search investments focused on discovering, 
creating, 
commercializing, 
and 
dem-
onstrating new technologies and manufac-
turing 
those 
technologies 
domestically 
throughout the country to ensure the leader-
ship of the United States in the industries of 
the future. 
(4) The distribution of innovation jobs and 
investment in the United States has become 
largely concentrated in just a few locations, 
while much of the Nation has been left out of 
growth in the innovation sector. More than 
90 percent of the Nation’s innovation sector 
employment growth in the last 15 years was 
generated in just 5 major metropolitan 
areas. The Federal Government must address 
this imbalance in opportunity by— 
(A) dramatically increasing funding for 
science and engineering research and ex-
panding partnerships with the private sector 
to build new technology hubs across the 
country; 
(B) spreading high-quality innovation sec-
tor jobs more broadly; 
(C) increasing the participation of under-
represented populations, engaging workers, 
and collaborating with labor organizations 
in innovation efforts to tap the talent and 
potential of the entire Nation to ensure the 
United States leads the industries of the fu-
ture; and 
(D) building regional capacity in such crit-
ical areas as entrepreneurship, access to cap-
ital and other investment, and supply chain 
development. 
(5) As President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
stated, ‘‘[N]ew frontiers of the mind are be-
fore us, and if they are pioneered with the 
same vision, boldness, and drive with which 
we have waged this war we can create a 
fuller and more fruitful employment and a 
fuller and more fruitful life.’’ 
(6) As Vannevar Bush stated in his 1945 re-
port entitled Science, The Endless Frontier, 
‘‘New products, new industries, and more 
jobs require continuous additions to knowl-
edge of the laws of nature, and the applica-
tion of that knowledge to practical purposes. 
Similarly, our defense against aggression de-
mands new knowledge so that we can develop 
new and improved weapons. This essential, 
new knowledge can be obtained only through 
basic scientific research.’’ 
(7) Since their inception, the National 
Science Foundation and other key Federal 
agencies, like the Department of Energy, 
have carried out vital work supporting basic 
and applied research to create knowledge 
that is a key driver of the economy of the 
United States and enhances the Nation’s se-
curity. 
SEC. 3. IMPROVING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVA-
TION RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL 
SCIENCE FOUNDATION. 
(a) PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO DISSEMINATE 
INFORMATION.—Section 11 of the National 
Science Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 
1870) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (j), by striking ‘‘and’’ 
after the semicolon; 
(2) in subsection (k), by striking the period 
at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following:

without publicly presenting justification or 
evidence of wrongdoing; 
Whereas even Paul Whelan’s Federal Secu-
rity 
Service-appointed 
lawyer, 
Vladimir 
Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019, ‘‘[The 
Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out 
what they have, but in this case, we’ve seen 
nothing concrete against Whelan in five 
months. That means there is nothing.’’; 
Whereas the then United States Ambas-
sador to the Russian Federation, Jon Hunts-
man, responded on April 12, 2019, to a ques-
tion about the detention of Paul Whelan, ‘‘If 
the Russians have evidence, they should 
bring it forward. We have seen nothing. If 
there was a case, I think the evidence would 
have been brought forward by now.’’; 
Whereas then Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo met with Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and urged 
him to ensure United States citizens are not 
unjustly held abroad; 
Whereas the Kremlin has refused Paul 
Whelan full access to his lawyer and the so- 
called evidence against him, and any evi-
dence he has seen is in Russian, a language 
Paul does not read or speak; 
Whereas Lefortovo pre-trial detention fa-
cility and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-
fused to provide medical treatment for Paul 
Whelan’s medical condition, despite being 
aware of its worsening state, resulting in 
emergency surgery on May 29, 2020; 
Whereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully con-
victed on June 15, 2020, and sentenced to 16 
years in a Russian labor camp by a three- 
judge panel, in a trial witnessed by United 
States Ambassador John Sullivan, who re-
ferred to it as ‘‘a mockery of justice’’ due to 
the denial of a fair trial and the exclusion of 
defense witnesses; 
Whereas, in August 2020, on an unknown 
day because he was moved secretly, Paul 
Whelan was transferred to camp IK–17, a 
penal labor camp in Mordovia, where he is 
forced to work 6 days a week in a garment 
factory; 
Whereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while 
visiting Paul Whelan at the labor camp in 
Mordovia, stated that ‘‘Russian authori-
ties. . . have never shown the world evidence 
of his guilt,’’ and reiterated his call that the 
Russian authorities correct this injustice 
and release Mr. Whelan; and 
Whereas 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony 
Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Min-
ister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021, and 
urged him to release Americans detained in 
Russia, including Paul Whelan and Trevor 
Reed, so that they are able to return home to 
their families in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) implores the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation present credible evidence on 
the allegations against Paul Whelan or im-
mediately release him from imprisonment; 
(2) implores the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation comply with its inter-
national treaty obligations and provide unre-
stricted consular access to Paul Whelan 
while he remains imprisoned in Russia; 
(3) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide Paul Whelan and all 
other political prisoners their constitu-
tionally afforded due process rights and uni-
versally recognized human rights; and 
(4) expresses sympathy to the family of 
Paul Whelan for this travesty to justice and 
personal hardship, and expresses hope that 
their ordeal can soon be brought to a just 
end. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 166—RECOG-
NIZING THE DUTY OF THE FED-
ERAL GOVERNMENT TO CREATE 
A GREEN NEW DEAL 
Mr. 
MARKEY 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
WYDEN, Ms. WARREN, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. 
PADILLA, 
Mr. 
VAN
HOLLEN, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. MURPHY, Ms. HIRONO, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Mr. BOOKER) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works: 
S. RES. 166 
Whereas the October 2018 report entitled 
‘‘Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and the November 2018 Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment report found 
that— 
(1) human activity is the dominant cause 
of observed climate change over the past 
century; 
(2) a changing climate is causing sea levels 
to rise and an increase in wildfires, severe 
storms, droughts, and other extreme weather 
events that threaten human life, healthy 
communities, and critical infrastructure; 
(3) global warming at or greater than 2 de-
grees Celsius beyond preindustrialized levels 
will cause— 
(A) mass migration from the regions 
most affected by climate change; 
(B) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost an-
nual economic output in the United States 
by the year 2100; 
(C) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually 
burn at least twice as much forest area in 
the western United States than was typi-
cally burned by wildfires in the years pre-
ceding 2019; 
(D) a loss of more than 99 percent of all 
coral reefs on Earth; 
(E) more than 350,000,000 more people to 
be exposed globally to deadly heat stress 
by 2050; and 
(F) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 
of public infrastructure and coastal real es-
tate in the United States; and 
(4) global temperatures must be kept less 
than 
1.5 
degrees 
Celsius 
above 
preindustrialized levels to avoid the most se-
vere impacts of a changing climate, which 
will require— 
(A) global reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions from human sources of 40 to 60 
percent from 2010 levels by 2030; and 
(B) net-zero global emissions by 2050; 
Whereas, because the United States has 
historically been responsible for a dispropor-
tionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, 
having emitted 20 percent of global green-
house gas emissions through 2014, and has a 
high technological capacity, the United 
States must take a leading role in reducing 
emissions through economic transformation; 
Whereas the United States is currently ex-
periencing several related crises, with— 
(1) life expectancy declining while basic 
needs, such as clean air, clean water, healthy 
food, and adequate health care, housing, 
transportation, and education, are inacces-
sible to a significant portion of the United 
States population; 
(2) a 4-decade trend of wage stagnation, 
deindustrialization, and antilabor policies 
that has led to— 
(A) hourly wages overall stagnating since 
the 1970s despite increased worker produc-
tivity; 
(B) 
the 
third-worst 
level 
of 
socio-
economic mobility in the developed world 
before the Great Recession; 
(C) the erosion of the earning and bar-
gaining power of workers in the United 
States; and 
(D) inadequate resources for public sec-
tor workers to confront the challenges of 
climate change at the Federal, State, and 
local level; and 
(3) the greatest income inequality since 
the 1920s, with— 
(A) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 
91 percent of gains in the first few years of 
economic recovery after the Great Reces-
sion; 
(B) a large racial wealth divide amount-
ing to a difference of 20 times more wealth 
between the average White family and the 
average Black family; and 
(C) a gender earnings gap that results in 
women earning approximately 80 percent 
as much as men, at the median; 
Whereas climate change, pollution, and en-
vironmental destruction have exacerbated 
systemic racial, regional, social, environ-
mental, and economic injustices (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘systemic injustices’’) by 
disproportionately affecting indigenous peo-
ples, communities of color, migrant commu-
nities, deindustrialized communities, de-
populated rural communities, the poor, low- 
income workers, women, the elderly, the 
unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘frontline 
and vulnerable communities’’); 
Whereas, climate change constitutes a di-
rect threat to the national security of the 
United States— 
(1) by impacting the economic, environ-
mental, and social stability of countries and 
communities around the world; and 
(2) by acting as a threat multiplier; 
Whereas the Federal Government-led mo-
bilizations during World War II and the New 
Deal created the greatest middle class that 
the United States has ever seen, but many 
members of frontline and vulnerable commu-
nities were excluded from many of the eco-
nomic and societal benefits of those mobili-
zations; and 
Whereas the Senate recognizes that a new 
national, social, industrial, and economic 
mobilization on a scale not seen since World 
War II and the New Deal era is a historic op-
portunity— 
(1) to create millions of good, high-wage 
jobs in the United States; 
(2) to provide unprecedented levels of pros-
perity and economic security for all people 
of the United States; and 
(3) to counteract systemic injustices: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) it is the duty of the Federal Govern-
ment to create a Green New Deal— 
(A) to achieve the greenhouse gas and toxic 
emissions reductions needed to stay under 
1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, through a 
fair and just transition for all communities 
and workers; 
(B) to create millions of good, high-wage 
union jobs and encourage collective bar-
gaining agreements to ensure prosperity and 
economic security for all people of the 
United States; 
(C) to invest in the infrastructure and in-
dustry of the United States to sustainably 
meet the challenges of the 21st century; 
(D) to secure for all people of the United 
States for generations to come— 
(i) clean air and water; 
(ii) climate and community resiliency; 
(iii) healthy food; 
(iv) access to nature; and 
(v) a sustainable environment; and 
(E) to promote justice and equity by stop-
ping current, preventing future, and repair-
ing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, 
communities of color, migrant communities, 
deindustrialized communities, depopulated 
rural communities, the poor, low-income 
workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused,

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CENTEN-

ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
KIWANIS CLUB OF ANN ARBOR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the centennial anniversary 
of the Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor. I am proud 
to celebrate their 100 years of service to the 
children, youth, and families of our Ann Arbor 
community. 
Kiwanis International was founded in 1915 
in Detroit, Michigan. In its early years, mem-
bers focused on business networking but 
changed its focus to service, particularly serv-
ice to children, by 1919. Following this admi-
rable mission of service to local communities, 
the Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor was organized 
on May 13, 1921 and was chartered on June 
13, 1921 with 60 members. In 1922, Kiwanis 
Club of Ann Arbor began working with the Uni-
versity of Michigan Hospital to provide recre-
ation and education for children staying there, 
and later established a Michigan District 
project that enabled Kiwanis chapters to serve 
children in hospitals across the state. Beyond 
their work in hospitals, the Kiwanis Club of 
Ann Arbor has raised money through their 
thrift sales that contribute to a variety of local 
charitable organizations. 
A century later, the Kiwanis Club of Ann 
Arbor continues to be a pillar of our Ann Arbor 
community. Since their founding, the club has 
inducted over 1,100 members and remains 
one of Michigan’s largest Kiwanis Clubs. 
Throughout the years, the Kiwanis Club of 
Ann Arbor has made a tremendous difference 
in our community, completing tens of thou-
sands of volunteer hours, and providing over 
$8 million in grants and services for children, 
students, and families in our community. With 
the help of great leadership and their dedi-
cated members and volunteers, the Kiwanis 
Club of Ann Arbor has lent its unwavering 
support to those in need, striving to improve 
our community and uplift everyone in it. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 100th anniversary 
of the Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor. We are 
grateful for the club’s century of impactful work 
and wish the Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor con-
tinued success in service in the years ahead.

WILLIAM J. KRAUTWALD 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of William 
‘‘Billy’’ J. Krautwald. 
Bill was born in Philadelphia, PA but lived 
out 30 years of his life in Franklinville, NJ be-
fore moving to Ellabell, GA. He then made his 
home in Richmond Hill, where he settled for 
the next 4 years. 
My union brother, Billy Krautwald, believed, 
with his heart and soul, the basic principles 
and core values of the International Brother-
hood of Electrical Workers. He was a devoted 
member of the union who will be dearly 
missed. 
Billy’s career with the International Brother-
hood of Electrical Workers spanned almost 
five decades holding positions ranging from 
the executive board to president of the union. 
When Billy decided to retire, he would go on 
to train the next generation of union activists 
and become involved in politics to campaign 
for Habitat for Humanity. 
Billy was a devoted father to his two sons, 
Jeff Krautwald and Billy Krautwald. He was 
loving husband to Peggy Krautwald of 47 
years, and supportive family member and 
friend to those around him. He is remembered 
for all the help, guidance, and direction he of-
fered to the International Brotherhood of Elec-
trical Workers, blessing my fellow brothers and 
sisters with the skills of a master electrician 
and the heart of a lion to make our union one 
of the greatest in the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the late Mr. William ‘‘Billy’’ J. 
Krautwald of Philadelphia, PA, the ‘‘old guard’’ 
union worker, a leader, a friend, and a cele-
brated member of the New Jersey community.

HONORING EDDIE HILL’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Eddie Hill’s 100th birthday. 
Mr. Hill is a loving father, grandfather, great- 
grandfather and great-great-grandfather. Mr. 
Hill proudly served his country in World War II 
as part of the 1695th Engineer Combat Bat-
talion in an all-black combat unit. After serving 
in dangerous combat duty across Europe, Mr. 
Hill returned home, went to technical school, 
and went on to become an auto repair spe-
cialist. He even owned his own business, a 
true testament to his contributions to his com-
munity. 
For his contributions, his community loved 
him back. For his pre-birthday celebrations, 
his neighbors, friends, and family came to-
gether to honor Mr. Hill in a large drive-by pa-
rade. It is clear to everyone that knows Mr. 
Hill, that he has made the most of each of his 
one-hundred years. I wish him many more 
pursuing his passions of following baseball 
and gardening. 
On behalf of my community and our neigh-
bors across Burlington and Ocean Counties, I 
wish him a happy birthday and thank him for 
his service to our Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF DIXIE COUN-
TY’S CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the centennial celebration of Dixie 
County, Florida. Dixie County, FL will turn 100 
years old on April 25, 2021. Formerly part of 
Lafayette County, Dixie County was created in 
1921 and is home to the incorporated towns of 
Cross City, Old Town, and Horseshoe Beach. 
Dixie County is known for showcasing its 
rich history and beautiful landscapes. Home of 
the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge, 
Dixie County is a main attraction for the his-
toric Suwannee River, and the unique beach-
es nestled along the Gulf of Mexico. 
Cross City is the county seat of Dixie and is 
known for its central location along the Old 
Spanish Trail, running East to West and 
‘‘crossing’’ with Old Salt Road that leads to 
Horseshoe beach. In and around Cross City, 
you will find rural small towns that promote a 
thriving logging industry. South of Cross City 
you will find a coastal oasis where an abun-
dance of commercial fishermen still exists 
today. In addition to logging and fishing, there 
is an array of farming operations that largely 
contribute to Dixie County’s economy. 
Boat, plane, or train, there is no limit in get-
ting to and from Dixie County. The Dixie 
County Airport has served the community and 
our nation for many years. The airport was 
previously used as an advanced fighter base 
during World War II. 
Generations of some of the most hard-
working, hospitable, and humble people have 
called Dixie County, Florida home. Since its 
inception, the citizens of Dixie County have 
taken pride in preserving its history and edu-
cating our youth. Built in 1910, Old Town Ele-
mentary School is the oldest public building in 
Dixie County and currently houses the Dixie 
County Historical Society. Year after year, the 
county has worked hard to promote commu-
nity engagement by hosting annual festivals to 
showcase its rich cultural history. This year is 
no exception. 
It is my honor to recognize 100 years of 
growth and prosperity for Dixie County.

The Immigration and Nationality Act 
‘‘grants the President broad discretion to 
suspend the entry of aliens into the United 
States.’’ H.R. 1333 would amend that act to 
narrow the President’s authority to impose 
entry or visa restrictions on aliens (non-U.S. 
nationals) based on their country of birth, 
country of nationality, and certain other 
characteristics. By limiting the President’s 
authority to restrict entry into the United 
States, the bill could increase the number of 
aliens who arrive in the country and receive 
federal benefits. However, the current Ad-
ministration has not proposed any entry or 
visa restrictions that would be affected by 
H.R. 1333; to the contrary, it has revoked 
several entry and visa restrictions that had 
been promulgated by the previous Adminis-
tration: Therefore, CBO estimates that en-
acting H.R. 1333 would have no budgetary ef-
fects. (CBO has no basis for predicting 
whether a future Administration would seek 
to impose entry or visa restrictions in the 
absence of this legislation.) 
CBO has reviewed sections 1, 3, and 4 of 
H.R. 1333 and determined that those provi-
sions contain no intergovernmental or pri-
vate-sector mandates as defined in the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO 
has not reviewed section 2 of H.R. 1333 for 
intergovernmental or private-sector man-
dates. Section 4 of UMRA excludes from the 
application of that act any legislative provi-
sions that would establish or enforce statu-
tory rights prohibiting discrimination. CBO 
has determined section 2 of H.R. 1333 falls 
within that exclusion because it would ex-
tend protections against discrimination in 
the immigration process based on sex, na-
tional origin, and religion. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
David Rafferty. The estimate was reviewed 
by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of 
Budget Analysis.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to be joined by Ranking 
Member LUCAS in introducing the Combating 
Sexual Harassment in Science Act. In the 
wake of the #MeToo movement, the nation is 
still reckoning with the pervasiveness of sex-
ual harassment and its impact on the lives and 
careers of women, including in academia. 
The academic workplace, when compared 
to the military, private sector, and government, 
has the second-highest rate of sexual harass-
ment, with 58 percent of women in academia 
experiencing sexual harassment. This behav-
ior 
undermines

April 20, 2021 
women in critical STEM fields. Many women 
report leaving promising careers in academic 
research altogether due to sexual harassment. 
Women of color are even more likely to expe-
rience sexual harassment and to feel unsafe 
at work. We cannot afford—morally, scientif-
ically, or economically—to continue to lose 
these skilled scientists and engineers, particu-
larly from groups that are already underrep-
resented in STEM. 
As recommended in the landmark report by 
the National Academies entitled Sexual Har-
assment of Women: Climate, Culture, and 
Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine, this bill establishes a 
National Science Foundation program to sup-
port research into the factors contributing to 
sexual harassment in the scientific workforce, 
as well as the collection of data on the preva-
lence of sexual harassment in STEM. Further-
more, this bill directs the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy to issue uniform policy 
guidelines to Federal science agencies to en-
sure every agency has clear policies and dedi-
cated resources to prevent and respond to in-
cidents of sexual harassment at academic in-
stitutions receiving federal research funding. It 
also creates an interagency working group to 
improve 
coordination 
and 
communication 
among agencies. 
It is my hope that this legislation will build 
upon progress already made by the National 
Science Foundation and other agencies over 
the last few years. In 2018, the Foundation 
updated its award terms and conditions to en-
sure the agency is alerted of findings of sexual 
harassment or administrative actions taken 
against NSF-funded researchers during the 
course of an investigation. It is vital that agen-
cies and grantees, as stewards of Federal 
money, take seriously their responsibility to 
foster a healthy working environment as they 
train the next generation of scientists. It is en-
couraging that other agency heads have taken 
steps to address sexual harassment in re-
search. Following NSF’s lead, the National In-
stitutes of Health instituted a similar update to 
its grant rules. The approach must be coordi-
nated to minimize confusion and burden for in-
stitutions and researchers. 
I also credit Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, former 
OSTP Director, for his commitment to this 
issue. In his testimony to the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology last year, Dr. 
Droegemeier reported that the Joint Com-
mittee on Research Environments (JCORE) 
Subcommittee on Safe and Inclusive Environ-
ments was compiling a comprehensive inven-
tory of Federal agency policies and practices 
targeted at addressing all forms of harassment 
in the research environment, with the intent to 
identify best practices and develop a coordi-
nated Federal action plan. I urge the current 
administration to make this a priority. These 
resources are urgently needed. 
Scientific societies, universities, national lab-
oratories, and those in leadership positions 
across the scientific enterprise also play an 
important role in combating sexual harassment 
in the sciences. I am pleased that my legisla-
tion is endorsed by 23 scientific societies and 
student organizations. In developing this bill, 
feedback from university associations and sci-
entific societies has been invaluable, and it is 
encouraging that so many key players are 
committed to addressing sexual harassment in 
science. 
This legislation supports a coordinated evi-
dence-based approach to addressing the 
problem of sexual harassment at research uni-
versities and funds research that will serve as 
the foundation for future initiatives in this area. 
I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us 
and help move this legislation forward into 
law.

THOMAS JEFFERSON DAY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud the anniver-
sary of Thomas Jefferson’s birthday. 
As our third President, a Founding Father, 
and the main author of the Declaration of 
Independence, Thomas Jefferson was a form-
ative voice in our nascent American democ-
racy. Jefferson championed the ideas of reli-
gious tolerance, human rights, and liberty for 
all. He considered democracy, along with a 
free press and robust public education system, 
to be the embodiment of a thriving, successful 
society. These indelible notions continue to be 
fundamental to our country today. 
On his 278th birthday, I extend my deepest 
thanks and respect to Thomas Jefferson for 
his commitment to the ideals of democracy 
and his stringent belief in the strength of the 
United States of America.

NORTHERN 
MARIANA 
ISLANDS 
WAGE AND ECONOMIC STABILITY 
ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Northern Mariana Islands Wage 
and Economic Stability Act. This legislation 
delays for 18 months, in the Marianas only, 
any national increase in the federal minimum 
wage that Congress may enact. My bill, also, 
requires a Government Accountability Office 
report on the economic impact in the Marianas 
of such a national wage increase. 
Unlike the rest of our nation, where min-
imum wage has been static, the minimum 
wage in the Marianas has more than doubled 
over recent years to reach the federal level of 
$7.25. 
These substantial increases have made life 
better for thousands of Marianas families and 
encouraged more U.S. workers to enter the 
workforce. 
But I had to carefully time those increases 
year-by-year with legislation and based on the 
help of Government Accountability Office re-
ports to ensure—successfully—that wages 
went up without jeopardizing jobs. 
Economic conditions in the Marianas remain 
separate from the national situation. Whereas 
Gross Domestic Product rose nationally in 
2019, in the Marianas GDP plunged 11.2 per-
cent that year. That decline came after a 19.3 
percent decrease in 2018. And it is reasonable 
to expect the picture in the Marianas for 2020 
will be no better. Our tourism-based economy 
will remain dormant until the pandemic has 
passed. Meanwhile, nationally, we expect 
growth on the order of 6 percent this year. 
My point is simply this: If we are going to 
raise the wage in the Marianas—and, believe 
me, I do—then we must do it as we did be-
fore: with a close eye on the economic condi-
tions in the islands. They are vastly different 
than conditions in the nation as a whole. 
Again, I fully support raising the minimum 
wage in our country—I want workers to earn 
more. 
I believe the best way to accomplish that 
goal in the insular area I represent, however, 
is through my legislation, the Northern Mar-
iana Islands Wage and Economic Stability Act. 
My bill will give Congress the analytical tools 
and the time to consider how best to schedule 
wage increases in the Marianas to improve 
the lives of workers and their families, while 
ensuring the businesses employing those 
workers can thrive.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud John Faczak 
for receiving the Adams County Mayors and 
Commissioners Youth Award. 
John Faczak is an 11th grader at Bennett 
High School and received this award because

him to overcome adversities. 
The 
dedication 
demonstrated

ment that can be attained with hard work and

CONGRATULATING 
DHWANI 
KHAREL 
ON 
BEING 
NAMED 
SOUTH DAKOTA’S 2021 TRUMAN 
SCHOLAR 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dhwani 
Kharel on being named South Dakota’s 2021 
Truman Scholar. 
The Truman Scholarship was established by 
Congress in 1975 as a living legacy to Presi-
dent Harry Truman to support and inspire the 
next generation of public service leaders. 
Dhwani was one of 62 Scholars selected from 
a record number of 845 applicants. 
As a junior at Dartmouth College, Dhwani 
has already demonstrated a commitment to 
public service and leadership. She is actively 
involved in sexual violence prevention advo-
cacy on Dartmouth’s campus and has interned 
at both the Congressional Research Service 
and the Brookings Area United Way. 
I commend Dhwani for her outstanding 
record of service, hard work, and leadership. 
I have no doubt she will excel in the future as 
she plans to pursue a career in the legal field 
to advance women’s rights. 
As a Truman Scholar myself, I am honored 
to congratulate Dhwani on this honor. I look 
forward to seeing all that she accomplishes.

HOMELAND 
SECURITY 
ACQUISI-

PROFESSIONAL 
CAREER 
PROGRAM ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s staff, like all our 
government agencies, should reflect the diver-
sity of this country. That is why I rise to offer 
H.R. 367, the ‘‘Homeland Security Acquisition 
Professional Career Program Act.’’ 
Due in large part to the American Rescue 
Plan, the United States is well on its way to 
crushing the virus that has plagued us for over 
a year. As a result, domestic travel is increas-
ing. 
Accordingly, we must ensure that airports, 
like McCarran International in Las Vegas, 
have the equipment and trained personnel 
they need to safely and efficiently welcome 
travelers. 
We can and should fill these frontline jobs, 
ranging from TSA agents to cyber security an-
alysts, with veterans and graduates of HBCUs 
and Hispanic-serving institutions. That is ex-
actly what my bill seeks to do. 
Each year, the Department spends billions 
of dollars acquiring the goods and services 
needed to carry out its many missions. In ad-
dition to COVID–19 supplies, this includes ev-
erything from Coast Guard ships to the 
screening technologies that the Transportation 
Security Administration uses to secure our na-
tion’s travel infrastructure. 
Unfortunately, a Government Accountability 
Office review found that 51 of these DHS 
major acquisition programs experienced work-
force shortfalls. 
In an effort to address said shortages, DHS 
established the Acquisition Professional Ca-
reer Program. 
This 3-year development program affords in-
dividuals rigorous training and on-the-job ex-
perience within DHS. 
It also provides rotations to other compo-
nents or offices within the Department, 
mentorship, and additional career develop-
ment opportunities. 
As a result, program participants graduate 
as certified acquisition professionals in their 
respective fields, such as contract specialists, 
cost estimators, and systems engineers. 
H.R. 367 will ensure this program remains 
in place for years to come so that DHS main-
tains a pipeline for qualified acquisition lead-
ers. 
My bill will also require DHS to provide Con-
gress with key information on the program for 
the next 5 years. 
H.R. 367, if enacted, would help DHS 
strengthen and diversify its acquisition work-
force by directing recruitment efforts to histori-
cally underrepresented individuals. 
This will ensure that the Department, spe-
cifically including our TSA officials, is more 
representative and is more sensitive to the 
needs, cultural differences, and societal ex-
pectations of our heterogenous population, in-
cluding the traveling public. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘yes’ 
on its passage.

URIAH HENRY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Uriah Henry 
for receiving the Adams County Mayors and 
Commissioners Youth Award. 
Uriah Henry is a 12th grader at Legacy High 
School and received this award because his 
determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Uriah 
Henry is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Uriah Henry for winning the Adams County

have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

TRIBUTE TO BISHOP CHARLES E. 
DAVIS 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 20, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Bishop Charles E. Davis was born in 
Leland, Mississippi in 1923, he graduated from 
high school in 1940 and migrated to Chicago, 
Illinois. In 1940 at the age of 19, he joined the 
military and participated in World War II. 
In the military, Charles Edward Davis spent 
time in France, Holland, and Germany. He 
was a good soldier and attained the rank of 
Sergeant. After the war, he returned to Chi-
cago and with his friend James McDonald, 
they opened an upholstery business and 
through his friendship with the McDonald Fam-
ily he was introduced to the Indiana Avenue 
Pentecostal Church. He was welcomed into 
Indiana Avenue by Elder Charles Ellis and en-
joyed going there and being with the people. 
After the passing of Elder Ellis the new Pas-
tor Elder Odee Akins recognized the leader-
ship abilities of the young man and assigned 
him to leadership roles. He served as Sunday 
School Superintendent, Young Peoples Lead-
er and President of the Senior Choir, all of the 
time growing in spirituality and experiencing 
the call to preach. 
In 1970, Elder Charles E. Davis was elected 
Pastor of the Indiana Avenue Pentecostal 
Church after the death of Elder Atkins. He 
soon resigned from his job at Hart, Schaftner 
and Marx and became a full-time Pastor and 
the rest became history. 
The church grew, new programs were es-
tablished, community outreach took place, the 
church acquired property in the area as both 
Elder Davis and the church rose in religious, 
social, and political circles. 
Elder Charles Davis and his wife of 43 
years Geraldine Olivia Davis were actively in-
volved in all aspects of community life and in 
1986 he was elevated to Bishop. 
After the death of his wife Geraldine he was 
blessed to wed again in 2004, to his second 
wife Dr. Jessie Bell Ray and they continued to 
provide great leadership until his death and 
being on earth for 98 years Bishop Charles 
Edwards Davis went home to meet his maker, 
May He Rest In Peace.
