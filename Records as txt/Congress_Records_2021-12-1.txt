WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2021 
No. 207 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
December 1, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable GREG 
STANTON to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
INFLATION IN DAILY LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, real wages 
have decreased 7 out of the past 9 
months. The increase in the cost of 
consumer goods is at a 30-year high. 
What do these numbers actually mean 
in your daily life? 
You wake up in the morning and you 
go to make breakfast. You want scram-
bled eggs? They will be 11.6 percent 
more expensive. What about bacon? At 
a 20.2 percent increase on bacon, you 
might even take that off the menu. 
Don’t forget your morning cup of coffee 
that is 5.6 percent more expensive. 
You make a mad dash to get the kids 
ready for school and then out the door. 
That will be a 4.3 percent increase in 
the cost of their clothing and a 7.5 per-
cent increase in the cost of their shoes. 
You have gotten the kids on the bus 
and now you can go on to work your-
self. 
Gas prices are now 51.3 percent high-
er, so it is going to cost you a lot more 
to drive to work. Have you been think-
ing about that new car? You can forget 
that, prices are up 9.8 percent on new 
cars. You want to save money and 
maybe get a used car? Good luck with 
that because they are up 26.4 percent. 
You arrive at work, but you realize 
you left your lunch at home. The cost 
of a plate at a nearby diner is up 5.3 
percent. On your way home, you stop 
to pick up your kids to take them to 
practice. You make sure to tell them 
to take it easy though and make sure 
they don’t wear out their sports equip-
ment because their sports equipment is 
up 8 percent. 
Now you are home for dinner and 
those pork chops you are making for 
dinner are up 15.9 percent. The canned 
vegetables are up 6.6 percent. 
Your long day is finally over. You 
made it. Time to kick back, relax, 
watch some TV—wait a minute, the TV 
last year that you bought for Christ-
mas is up 10.4 percent, and there is no 
doubt that last Christmas it was down 
that much. 
So what is the difference here? I 
think it is called the Biden economy. 
Maybe if people in the administration 
spent a day in the shoes of the average 
person, the person that goes to work 
every day, the person that has to pay 
these prices that we are talking about, 
maybe then they would realize that the 
policies that are being done right now 
and being put in place right now and 
have been put in place over the last 10 
months is the cause of this, and that 
they would work with us to get it fixed. 
f 
HONORING ROSA PARKS ON THE 
66TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER AR-
REST AND THE BEGINNING OF 
THE 
MONTGOMERY 
BUS 
BOY-
COTT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an American pioneer 
and one of the greatest heroines of our 
time, Mrs. Rosa Parks on the 66th an-
niversary of her arrest in Montgomery, 
Alabama. 
Today, 66 years ago, Rosa Parks took 
a bold stand against racial discrimina-
tion by refusing to give up her seat on 
a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama. 
Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat 
did more than simply desegregate the 
bus systems of Montgomery. Her dig-
nified courage inspired a movement 
that changed our Nation. 
Rosa Parks’ quiet refusal to sur-
render her seat to a White passenger on 
December 1, 1955, sparked a city-wide 
boycott of the Montgomery bus system 
that lasted 1 whole year and broke the 
very will of a city heavily steeped in 
segregation. 
Biographer 
Douglas 
Brinkley 
re-
counted the powerful moment in his bi-
ography of Rosa Parks, he writes: 
Are you going to stand up? the driver de-
manded. Rosa Parks looked straight at him 
and said, No. Flustered and not quite sure 
what to do, the bus driver retorted: Well, I’m 
going to have you arrested. And Rosa Parks 
sat next to the window, and quietly said: You 
may do that. 
Her soft yet forceful response led to 
an arrest, a $10 fine, and the beginning 
of the most important demonstration 
in American history. The Montgomery 
bus boycott stands as a powerful testa-
ment of the will of a disenfranchised 
people to work collectively to achieve 
extraordinary social change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6716 
December 1, 2021 
Today, while we commemorate the 
progress that has been made, we must 
also recommit ourselves to the strug-
gle and the fight for equal justice. We 
must remain vigilant in the struggle 
for voting rights, criminal justice re-
form, and economic equity. 
Foot 
soldiers 
like 
Rosa 
Parks, 
Claudette Colvin, and Attorney Fred 
Gray, whose lifelong work in the fight 
for justice and equality still resonate 
with us today and reminds us that we 
cannot take for granted the battles en-
dured by those before us; nor must we 
neglect our own responsibility to en-
sure liberty and justice. 
As benefactors of the sacrifices of 
these brave men and women, we must 
be willing to answer the modern day 
call and to dare to be trailblazers on 
our own. Rosa Parks’ quiet refusal to 
surrender her seat on December 1, 1955, 
inspired generations of others to con-
tinue her legacy by standing up for the 
values that our democracy holds dear. 
Because of her contributions, I am 
proud to join with Congressman JIM 
COOPER and CBC Chairwoman JOYCE 
BEATTY in introducing the Rosa Parks 
Day Act, which would designate today, 
December 1, as a new Federal holiday 
in her honor. 
This bill will ensure that her brave 
sacrifice lives on in American history 
and serves as a reminder to continue to 
protect the gains that we have made 
over 60 years ago while tackling the 
challenges that plague this Nation 
today. 
While we honor the guardian of the 
Montgomery bus boycott today, we 
must also acknowledge her sacrifices 
and do our own responsibility as a call 
to action. Though Jim Crow is no 
more, there are modern-day challenges 
that require the time and talents of 
each of us. We must remain vigilant in 
seeking justice for the countless Black 
Americans that fall victim to police 
brutality. 
We must remain vigilant in our com-
mitment to continuing the fight to 
protect the sacred right to vote. We 
owe Rosa Parks and so many others 
nothing less. 
f 
TOO MUCH SALT IN 
WASHINGTON’S DIET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, middle- and 
lower-income households across the 
country are getting the short end of 
the stick under the so-called Build 
Back Better Act. 
For months, House Republicans have 
exposed radical provisions in this bill 
that do nothing to help the American 
people or the country. One such provi-
sion is the raising of State and local 
tax deductions, commonly referred to 
as SALT. 
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 
$10,000 cap was placed on SALT deduc-
tions. This meant that taxpayers who 
itemized their returns could deduct up 
to $10,000 in certain taxes that are paid 
to State and local governments. 
Under the so-called Build Back Bet-
ter Act, the cap would be set at $80,000. 
That is a $70,000 increase in tax deduc-
tions for high-income households in 
America. The Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget estimates that 
raising the SALT cap to $80,000 equates 
to a gift of $625 billion in perpetuity to 
wealthy Americans. 
Speaker PELOSI was quoted as saying 
that 
raising 
SALT 
deductions 
is 
‘‘about which States get the revenue 
they need in order to meet the needs of 
the people.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that claim may sound 
appeasing to some, but not all Mem-
bers of the Democrat Party are sold. 
Jason Furman, the former chair of 
former President Obama’s Council of 
Economic Advisers and current Har-
vard economist, calls this giveaway ob-
scene. 
Representative 
JARED
GOLDEN, 
a 
Democrat 
from 
Maine, 
who 
voted 
against the so-called Build Back Better 
Act, said he was concerned about tax 
giveaways to millionaires. Even Sen-
ator BERNIE
SANDERS
came out in 
staunch opposition to these proposed 
changes for the SALT cap. Noticing a 
pattern here? 
Consider who will be the people reap-
ing these benefits. Here is a hint: it is 
not hardworking American families. 
With the tax deduction cap set at 
$80,000, the households with the highest 
income would be saving $25,900 more 
than they do under the current law. 
The Tax Policy Center found that 
this $80,000 cap would directly benefit 
the 
top 
1 
percent 
of 
households. 
Middle- and lower-income households 
will be left behind. With only 5.4 per-
cent of the households earning more 
than $200,000 per year in North Caro-
lina, few people would receive this 
handout. 
Higher-income States such as Cali-
fornia, New York, and New Jersey have 
historically benefitted from SALT cap 
deductions—with North Carolina being 
far removed from the conversation. 
Mr. Speaker, economic experts, Re-
publicans, and even Democrat Members 
of Congress agree that Washington has 
too much SALT in its diet. If the ma-
jority believes upping SALT deductions 
and leaving both middle- and lower-in-
come Americans behind is a viable 
route to take, the consequences would 
be a lot more than they bargained for. 
The Senate should kill the so-called 
Build Back Better Act immediately. 
f 
DETERIORATING 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN TEXAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to call attention to a mount-
ing problem which is affecting every 
Texan: our deteriorating infrastruc-
ture. 
Now, I know a thing about infra-
structure. When I was a county com-
missioner, I saw firsthand how a lack 
of investment directly impacted people 
in my area. As a State, we regularly 
have received scores of C and D on our 
infrastructure. In my own area, it was 
even worse because of the damage that 
hurricanes and flooding did on a reg-
ular basis. 
These deteriorating roads and bridges 
cost Texans over $700 a year in dam-
ages and extra vehicle maintenance. 
That is an entire paycheck for many of 
the people in my district. On top of 
that, Houstonians have had to deal 
with the twin trouble of decaying roads 
and rapid growth. 
Harris County is now home to over 
700,000 more people than it had in 2010. 
Without significant investment, we are 
trying to fit more and more people 
onto the same deteriorating roads. 
Mr. Speaker, the traffic is so bad in 
parts of my city that I and many other 
Houstonians simply avoid entire neigh-
borhoods 
altogether. 
This 
directly 
hurts small business owners who de-
pend on infrastructure for people to 
reach their stores. 
Mr. Speaker, poor infrastructure does 
more than hurt families’ pocketbooks, 
it has already cost us lives. Everyone 
in Texas remembers the winter storm 
this past February that left millions 
freezing in their homes without power. 
The extreme cold weather brought 
State power systems to the brink of 
collapse. Over 200 Texans died in this 
storm, many of them seniors, from cold 
weather exposure. It didn’t have to be 
this way. The State government had 
the choice the last time this kind of 
storm happened in 2011 to take the ad-
vice of Federal regulators and prepare 
our power grid for winter emergencies. 
Instead, the State has done nothing 
and will have to bear the cost. 
Many Houstonians will also remem-
ber Hurricane Ike, Hurricane Rita, and 
Hurricane Harvey, it comes one after 
another. Every year, another ‘‘storm of 
the century.’’ 
b 1015 
These storms have caused hundreds 
of deaths, billions in damages, and dis-
placed thousands from their homes in 
Houston. Mr. Speaker, I could go on 
and on, but the point is clear: my dis-
trict is facing a clear and present dan-
ger from the failure to invest in reli-
able infrastructure. 
During the previous administration, 
we heard promise after promise from 
Republicans. They were going to ad-
dress this with the so-called infrastruc-
ture weeks. I can’t even remember how 
many of those we had, but it certainly 
stretched for 4 years. Promises made, 
promises broken. 
But I am proud that today I can go 
back to my district and say that these 
critical investments are finally—fi-
nally—on their way. Thanks to Presi-
dent Biden’s commitment to working 
with Congress to get this done, Texas 
will receive $35 billion to rebuild our 
infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6717 
December 1, 2021 
For all the problems I have spoken 
about, the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act has a solution. This law 
will invest over $26 billion in funding 
for better roads and bridges built to 
last and to handle future growth. It 
will also invest $3.3 billion to improve 
public transit options that reduce con-
gestion and improve transportation for 
everyone. Texans will also benefit from 
a $3.5 billion program in this law that 
will protect power systems from weath-
er emergencies like the winter storm. 
But this law doesn’t just solve to-
day’s problems. It is also about pre-
paring us for tomorrow’s opportunities. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will deliver reliable internet 
access to rural Texas communities by 
investing over $100 million in expand-
ing coverage. This will allow rural Tex-
ans to finally access jobs and com-
merce that were previously locked 
away. 
This bill will also prepare Texas for 
electric vehicles of the future by in-
vesting nearly half a billion dollars to 
build our charging station network. 
Mr. Speaker, Texas is facing serious 
infrastructure problems. But this law 
is the solution. I am proud that this 
money will soon flow directly to com-
munities in my State and improve 
lives. 
Thanks to the leadership of President 
Biden, Speaker PELOSI, Leader SCHU-
MER, and some of our friends across the 
aisle, this bipartisan infrastructure bill 
will send help, and it is on the way.

MARC MOEN IS KEEPING IOWA 
BEAUTIFUL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize a man from 
my district for his commitment to 
keeping Iowa beautiful and preserving 
some of our most treasured historical 
sites. 
Marc Moen, a developer in Iowa City, 
was recently presented with the Iowa 
Architectural Foundation’s 2021 Com-
munity Enhancement Through Archi-
tecture and Design Award. The awards 
program recognizes individuals, organi-
zations, agencies, or communities out-
side the architectural profession who 
have demonstrated consistent and ef-
fective leadership, vision, and support 
for architecture, or have continually 
championed the cause of architecture 
in ways that contribute to the better-
ment of Iowa communities. 
Marc began his architectural work in 
1985 when he advocated to save the 
first brick house in Iowa City from 
being razed and began restoring the 
building instead. Since then, Marc has 
worked to make Iowa City the beau-
tiful community it is today. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Marc 
for his dedication to our community 
and to our State. 
LEWIS PAYNE IS CARRYING ON IOWA’S FAMILY 
FARM HERITAGE 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
today I recognize a man from my dis-
trict for continuing his family legacy 
of leadership in Iowa agriculture. 
This year, Lewis Payne of Kalona 
was awarded the Heritage Award by 
the Iowa Farm Bureau. The Heritage 
Award recognizes agriculture industry 
leaders who have carried on the tradi-
tion of farming family-owned land. 
Known as the Pickard Farm, Lewis’ 
261.4-acre plot of land was originally 
purchased 
by 
his 
great-great-grand 
uncle over 172 years ago and was passed 
from Lewis’ great-grandfather down to 
his grandfather, then eventually to his 
mother, who then passed the land down 
to Lewis, who had been raised on that 
farm helping his parents. 
When asked about the future of his 
family farm, Lewis said that his goal is 
to be a steward of the land and eventu-
ally pass it down to the next genera-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Lewis 
for continuing a fantastic Iowa family 
tradition and for making Iowa a better 
place to live, work, and raise a family. 
4 PAWS FOR ABILITY 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to share a heartwarming 
story about total strangers coming to-
gether to make a positive impact in a 
child’s life in my district. 
Six-year-old 
Keagan 
Berding 
of 
Bettendorf, Iowa, loves to run. Diag-
nosed with autism at the age of 2, 
Keagan is nonverbal, but he is very so-
cial and has several passions, including 
playing outside with other children, 
showing affection through hugs, and 
watching videos on his tablet. 
Because of Keagan’s love of running, 
extra measures are needed to ensure 
his safety, and this is where a fantastic 
organization has come in to assist 
Keagan and his parents. 4 Paws for 
Ability is a group that provides and 
trains service animals to assist people 
like the Berding family across the 
globe. Currently the organization has 
raised over $43,000 toward providing 
Keagan with a fully trained service 
dog, with the largest single donation 
being $10,000 from a complete stranger 
whose own child has benefited from a 
service animal. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for 4 Paws 
for Ability and everyone who has con-
tributed for striving to make positive 
impacts in the lives of children like 
Keagan all over the world. 
f 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to say enough is enough. Enough 
is enough. 
Enough gun violence in our schools, 
enough children hiding in fear, and 
enough parents trembling in terror as 
they search for any news of their own 
kids. 
There were 100 calls made to 9–1-1 in 
Oxford yesterday. Hundreds of children 
were stuck in their classrooms crying 
out for help. Hundreds of kids were 
scared to death that this would be 
their last day of school. 
We have our young people learning 
how best to survive a shooter in be-
tween math and science class. Six year 
olds were asked to figure out for them-
selves whether they have a better 
chance to survive if they hide in a clos-
et or if they should rush the gunman. 
And then, on days like yesterday, 
days that repeat with the same fre-
quency as this body’s failure to re-
spond, we hear the stories of teenagers 
texting their parents from behind a 
desk saying things like: Mom, if I don’t 
make it, I love you, and I appreciate 
everything that you have done for me. 
Parents were begging their children to 
‘‘barricade yourselves behind doors, 
hide in classrooms, and, please, hold 
your tears, you cannot make a sound.’’ 
This Chamber has heard much about 
God since men first stood within these 
hallowed Halls. This Chamber has 
heard much about the God-given rights 
our Creator inalienably endowed. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I ask you then: 
What rights has God given our chil-
dren? 
Do they enjoy the God-given right to 
exist in their schools without fear of 
death or gun violence? 
Do American parents have the God- 
given right to drop their children off at 
school and expect to see them come 
home at night? 
Parents from Columbine to Sandy 
Hook to Parkland have had to bury 
their babies. And the children who sur-
vived have had to live with the trauma 
that only stepping over a friend paint-
ed in blood could ever bring. 
Do we, as a nation, have the God- 
given right to live free from this epi-
demic of gun violence, of senseless loss, 
and of unimaginable pain? 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of you here 
today to put yourselves in the shoes of 
those parents. Put yourselves in the 
shoes of the mothers and the fathers 
who have gasped for air when despera-
tion would not let them breathe. Put 
yourself in the shoes of all those who 
have sunk to their knees when the 
agony would not let them stand. 
Mr. Speaker, do you have the courage 
to do that, to feel what it might be like 
to bury your own child, to suffer with 
your God day after day to make sense 
of the senseless, unnecessary gun vio-
lence? 
Mr. Speaker, do you have the cour-
age? 
Does this body have the courage to 
do what is right and to save our chil-
dren and to protect our families? 
And if not, Mr. Speaker, do you real-
ly, truly, have the courage to look 
away?

AMERICA’S PETROLEUM RESERVE

Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6718 
December 1, 2021 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss President Biden’s short-
sighted decision to release 50 million 
barrels of oil from America’s Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve, depleting this na-
tional security asset by nearly 10 per-
cent when there is no oil supply short-
age, only a manmade one. 
The United States’ oil reserve is not 
a tool for the President to fix his own 
political problems. Sadly, this adminis-
tration throws money away whenever 
the problems they create reflect poorly 
on them. We have seen this with 
COVID–19 pandemic shutdowns and 
vaccine mandates keeping people out 
of work, leftist political aims resulting 
in bad legislation, and a flagrant dis-
regard for the national debt all leading 
to wasteful spending. 
Rather than drain one of our essen-
tial national security assets to tempo-
rarily mask the effects of their poli-
cies, this administration should in-
stead encourage our domestic, inde-
pendent oil and gas producers to take 
steps to get oil production back up. I 
shudder to think that the President 
might drain another 10 percent of our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve 2 months 
from now if our oil production con-
tinues to wane. 
There are other solutions to this 
issue, like reinstating the Keystone 
pipeline and encouraging oil produc-
tion on Federal lands just being two of 
them. Instead, this administration has 
canceled the Keystone pipeline, which 
would make 860,000 barrels of oil avail-
able daily, and has demanded a 50 per-
cent fee increase for oil and gas leasing 
on Federal lands. 
Just 2 years ago, the United States 
was producing 2 million more barrels of 
oil per day than we are now. We are 
down from 13 million barrels per day to 
11 million barrels per day. That means 
if we could lift regulations and find 
creative strategies to get our oil pro-
duction back up, we could create 50 
million barrels of oil in just 25 days 
rather than dip into the emergency re-
serves. 
Historically, the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve has only ever been used 
in cases of natural disaster and war. 
With global unrest from COVID–19 and 
America’s enemies looking to do us 
harm, this is not the time to needlessly 
weaken a national security asset that 
exists to provide energy to America in 
the event of an actual catastrophe in 
our country. 
The only catastrophe in America 
right now is this administration’s bad 
policies. I oppose the President using 
our emergency oil reserves in this bra-
zen political tactic. This is unneces-
sary, irresponsible, and dangerous. 
WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in defense of Kansas farmers and 
ranchers who have the right to manage 
their own resources without over-
reaching regulation from the Federal 
Government. 
The Biden administration is hurting 
farmers, 
ranchers, 
and 
ag-business 
owners. Recently, they withdrew from 
the Navigable Waters Protection Rule 
which sought to undo the harm caused 
by the Waters of the United States, or 
WOTUS, rule from 2015, through which 
the Federal Government aimed to 
exact regulatory control over nearly 
all bodies of water, regardless of their 
size or connection to larger waterways. 
Because of this legislative mess, farm-
ers and ranchers have had to conduct 
their businesses under three different 
regulatory definitions of water in just 
the past 6 years. 
On a farm, water is the lifeblood of 
the operation, and farmers in Kansas 
don’t need the Federal Government to 
tell them how to take care of it. Our 
farmers and ranchers are the original 
conservationists who continually up-
date their practices to reduce water 
use and inputs to produce safe, afford-
able 
food 
while 
maintaining 
their 
water supply for generations to come. 
Instead of worrying about what farm-
ers in Kansas are doing with their pud-
dles, the administration should instead 
focus on curbing inflation, getting 
Americans back to work, fixing the 
supply chain, and securing our borders.

SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss one of my greatest privileges 
as a Member of Congress, participating 
in the service academy nominations 
process, which brings together my pas-
sions for engaging with young people, 
leadership development, and military 
service in this great country. 
I am proud to come from a State 
with a rich history of military service. 
President Eisenhower graduated from 
West Point in 1915, which is why I felt 
it was appropriate to host our State’s 
nomination process in his Presidential 
library 
in 
Abilene, 
Kansas. 
After 
watching 
young 
Kansas 
men 
and 
women go through the extensive and 
competitive nomination exercise, one 
of the members of our selection com-
mittee said: ‘‘Meeting and working 
with these young people gives me hope 
for the future of our country.’’ 
In the United States, we have a long 
tradition of young American patriots 
willingly embracing the duty to serve, 
to protect the homeland, to keep the 
peace abroad, and to secure our rights. 
Leaders serve, and I want to congratu-
late all the deserving young leaders 
who are recipients of service academy 
nominations. I thank them from the 
bottom of my heart for their willing-
ness to sacrifice for this great country.

HONORING DR. ATTORNEY 
JOHNNIE JONES, SR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, this week, a Louisiana legend 
turned 102 years old. Dr. Attorney 
Johnnie Jones, Sr., has lived a lifetime 
fulfilling every day with service, activ-
ism, and love for family and country. 
Born in 1919, he was one of eight chil-
dren in a successful family who leased 
land in eastern Louisiana. He attended 
Southern University until being draft-
ed into the Army in 1942 during World 
War II where he was the first-ever Afri-
can-American warrant officer in United 
States Army history. 
Jones was injured in the battle at 
Normandy on D-day 77 years ago. Be-
fore landing on the beach, his ship hit 
a mine, and he flew from the second 
deck down to the first. As he described 
it, he flew like a bullet, but he sur-
vived, coming ashore on Omaha Beach, 
facing off with German snipers. Later 
in the war, he was hit with shrapnel 
during a bomber attack and finished 
his military service in the Battle of the 
Bulge. These nightmarish memories 
have remained with Mr. JONES until 
today. 
Much of his paperwork and records of 
service were lost during Hurricane 
Katrina, so it was earlier this year, at 
the age of 101, that Dr. Attorney Jones 
finally received the Purple Heart award 
in recognition of his battle injuries. 
Through all that he endured, he per-
sisted. He returned home to Louisiana, 
where he began to serve in a different 
capacity, this time as a lawyer. Just 15 
days out of Southern University’s law 
school in 1953, the Reverend T.J. 
Jemison recruited him to organize the 
United Defense League’s 8-day bus boy-
cott in Baton Rouge and defend the 
participants. 
After the Baton Rouge City Council 
revoked the licenses of Black-owned 
transportation companies, many Afri-
can Americans were forced to ride seg-
regated buses and sit in the back of the 
bus or stand. 
When hundreds of patrons boycotted 
riding 
in 
protest, 
some 
positive 
changes were made, though segregation 
still remained the law of the land. The 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King used 
the Baton Rouge protest as a model for 
his bus boycott in Montgomery 2 years 
later. 
Dr. Jones defended students in drug-
store sit-ins and other actions as civil 
rights protests spread throughout the 
South. During these efforts, his car was 
bombed twice. Immediately after his 
return from war, he was beaten by a 
White officer on his way to a doctor’s 
appointment. 
‘‘Things weren’t right,’’ said Dr. 
Jones. ‘‘I wanted to fight and make it 
better.’’ 
Here is a man who has been through 
so much, who has tasted the evils of 
the world and has every reason to be 
bitter, but he isn’t. However, he has in-
sisted on focusing his life on sharing 
love for our State and fighting for 
equality. 
Jones was the first African-American 
member of the Baton Rouge Bar Asso-
ciation. He served in the Louisiana 
House of Representatives. Throughout 
his career as a lawyer, he successfully 
sought pay equity for teachers and 
sued to desegregate parks and commu-
nities in Louisiana.

He also represented student pro-
testers at Southern University during 
the civil rights movement and count-
less indigent defendants, and he chal-
lenged voter discrimination practices 
throughout the South. 
I was grateful to have the oppor-
tunity to speak with Dr. Attorney 
Johnnie Jones on Veterans Day to 
thank him for his incredible service to 
our people in America. 
On his birthday, he celebrated with 
friends, family, and good Louisiana 
seafood. Today, let’s all thank Dr. 
Jones for his great advice that he 
shares with us, which is: ‘‘You have to 
deal with the past, and you have to 
deal with the history. You have to read 
and understand so we don’t repeat the 
past.’’ 
Let’s build better. Let’s build a fu-
ture for everyone. 
Please join me in wishing Dr. Attor-
ney Johnnie Jones, Sr., a happy 102nd 
birthday.

BORDER CROSSINGS FUEL OTHER 
CRISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to discuss an issue that is an un-
precedented issue, the border crisis 
that we are facing in this Nation that 
is fueling other crises: national secu-
rity, 
public 
safety, 
health, 
and 
fentanyl, all a burden on the hard-
working taxpayers and the American 
people. 
On October 3, following court orders, 
the Biden administration said that it 
would reinstate the remain in Mexico 
policy by mid-November. I rise today 
to point out that we are now in Decem-
ber, and no such action has been taken. 
Since President Biden has taken of-
fice, CBP has encountered more illegal 
immigrants than in 2018, 2019, and 2020 
combined. In October, 164,303 illegal 
immigrants crossed the border, the 
highest number in recorded history and 
80 percent higher than the previous 
record for the month of October, which 
is from October 1999. 
Mr. Speaker, 1.7 million people have 
crossed the border in the past year, 
which is roughly the same as the popu-
lation of President Biden’s home State 
of Delaware and Vice President HAR-
RIS’ home city of San Francisco com-
bined. 
These border crossings are creating 
many issues throughout our country. 
First, let’s talk about safety and secu-
rity. 
In the first month of this fiscal year, 
October, CBP arrested over 680 individ-
uals with criminal convictions and doz-
ens of known gang members, including 
23 members of MS–13. That is in just 1 
month. Multiple individuals on the FBI 
terrorist watch list have also been en-
countered over the last year. 
As a native New Yorker who was just 
blocks away from Ground Zero on 9/11, 
I can tell you that I was shaken to my 
core by reports that Panama was in the 
position of having to deny over 52 al- 
Qaida affiliates at their border who 
were coming to the United States. 
Last month, a 24-year-old man, who 
posed as an unaccompanied minor 
while illegally crossing our border, en-
tered this country and then murdered 
his foster parents in their Florida 
home. 
When is enough going to be enough 
for this administration and for my col-
leagues in the House? 
Let’s talk about fentanyl. Every 
Member of this Chamber knows the 
widespread pain plaguing our commu-
nities. We all have constituents who 
are suffering from the loss of life 
caused by an abundance of drugs being 
smuggled into our country. Counterfeit 
narcotics laced with fentanyl are being 
mass-produced in Mexico with chemi-
cals from China and are streaming over 
our open borders. The DEA is telling us 
so. They say that 80 percent of fentanyl 
in the United States has come over our 
borders, smuggled by the cartels. 
In the first month of this fiscal year, 
2022, October, CBP seized over 1,000 
pounds of fentanyl. That means that in 
just 1 month, CBP seized enough 
fentanyl 
to 
kill 
236,775,024 
people, 
American citizens. The U.S. recently 
recorded its highest number of drug 
overdose deaths in a 12-month period, 
surpassing 100,000 for the first time. 
Over 170 people overdosed on drugs 
during the first 9 months of 2021 in my 
community of Staten Island, and I 
know other Members have similar sto-
ries, too. Fentanyl was present in 
about 80 percent of the completed toxi-
cology 
reports 
for 
the 
2020 
fatal 
overdoses in Staten Island. 
So I ask my colleagues, whose side 
are you on? Are you on the side of the 
drug cartels, or are you on the side of 
the American people? 
I visited the border. I met with the 
CBP agents. I rode with the Texas De-
partment of Public Safety. I can’t say 
the same for our President, can’t say 
the same for our Vice President, can’t 
say the same for the Speaker. 
Despite all this, the Biden adminis-
tration has halted the construction of 
barriers while American taxpayers still 
foot the bill for a contract that has 
been in place. We are paying every 
month, yet the barriers aren’t going 
up. 
Instead, 
they 
want 
to 
further 
incentivize illegal border crossings by 
giving illegal immigrants $450,000 of 
taxpayer money, a total slap in the 
face to the taxpayers who bust their 
butts and pay taxes and expect this 
government to perform properly. 
The Biden administration now, in its 
misguided Build Back Better—or, I 
should say, build back broke—bill, 
wants to reward illegal immigration by 
granting mass amnesty, free college 
tuition, and childcare to those who un-
lawfully crossed. 
As a daughter of immigrants, I think 
it is incredibly important that we en-
force our laws and give people oppor-
tunity, but let’s make sure they are 
doing it the right way.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
NAVY 
SEAMAN 
SECOND 
CLASS 
CHARLES LOUIS ‘‘SONNY BOY’’ 
SAUNDERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Navy Seaman Second 
Class 
Charles 
Louis 
‘‘Sonny 
Boy’’ 
Saunders of Winnie, Texas, in my dis-
trict. 
Seaman Saunders was serving aboard 
the USS Oklahoma on the morning of 
December 7, 1941. Tragically, the Okla-
homa sustained 429 casualties during 
the attack on Pearl Harbor, claiming 
Mr. Saunders’ life that morning. After 
eight decades, 80 years, the Defense 
POW/MIA 
Accounting 
Agency, 
or 
DPAA, has identified Seaman Saun-
ders’ remains. 
This year, he will be reinterred in his 
hometown on the 80th anniversary of 
Pearl Harbor. Mr. Saunders was born to 
Mortimer Alvin and Melina Falke 
Saunders on October 16, 1923. He was 
the sixth child and one of four boys. 
His oldest brother, Adam, passed away 
at just 13 months old. He grew up with 
his sisters Lillie Mae, Mary Alice, 
Sadie Lee, and Anna Belle, along with 
brothers Sidney ‘‘Buddy’’ Edward and 
Mortimer Virgil. 
The Great Depression led to difficult 
times as their father worked in con-
struction and labored in the rice fields 
to provide for his family while his 
mother cared for the home and raised 
their children. Mr. Saunders’ youngest 
sister, Anna Belle, always spoke of her 
brother’s compassion and how he sac-
rificed so that she could have shoes for 
her daily walk to school. 
His kind, caring, and playful nature 
fueled his ambition to serve our Na-
tion. On November 23, 1940, 1 month 
after his 17th birthday, he joined the 
United States Navy. Not only did he 
possess a deep desire to serve our coun-
try, but he also had a great determina-
tion to make a better life for his par-
ents and his siblings. 
On December 7, 1941, Japanese air-
craft launched a surprise attack on the 
American fleet of battleships that were 
moored at Pearl Harbor, thrusting the 
United States into the Second World 
War. 
After Seaman Saunders’ warship cap-
sized because of the damage from the 
multiple 
Japanese 
torpedoes, 
his 
whereabouts were unknown. According 
to a casualty roster of the Oklahoma 
compiled 2 weeks after the attack, Sea-
man Saunders’ status was labeled as 
‘‘missing’’ but then later was amended 
to be ‘‘killed in action.’’ 
Those who perished aboard the USS 
Oklahoma were buried at two different 
cemeteries: the Halawa and Nu’uanu 
Naval Cemeteries in Hawaii. Most of 
the remains were recovered during sal-
vage operations but were unable to be

identified before their interment, and 
therefore, they were buried as ‘‘un-
knowns.’’ 
In recognition of his service, Seaman 
Saunders was awarded a Purple Heart 
for military merit and three ribbons 
for American Defense, American Cam-
paign, and the Asiatic-Pacific Cam-
paign. 
As the last living sibling, Anna Belle 
was committed to bringing her brother 
home and laying him to rest at the 
gravesite that their parents prepared 
for him those years and years ago at 
Fairview Cemetery in Winnie, Texas. 
b 1045 
In 2015, the DPAA was given author-
ity to exhume the unknown remains of 
these servicemen associated with the 
USS Oklahoma and to reexamine them. 
It was at this point that the military 
contacted Anna Belle, his younger sis-
ter. She worked tirelessly to gather 
and provide DNA of family members to 
help identify her brother’s remains. 
Unfortunately, Anna Belle passed 
away on July 19, 2019, but she never 
lost hope that her brother would one 
day return home. She prayed her un-
wavering mission would be continued 
by those who survived her, and it was. 
On February 11, 2021, the Saunders 
family received word that their long- 
lost relative had finally been found and 
identified. 
Mr. Speaker, Seaman Second Class 
Charles ‘‘Sonny Boy’’ Saunders’ arrival 
in Winnie, Texas, will be welcomed by 
many relatives, friends, and fellow pa-
triots; finally coming home. On the 
80th anniversary of his passing, Mr. 
Saunders will be buried alongside his 
parents with full military honors. 
May God continue to bless this fam-
ily for their long record of service and 
sacrifice to our great Nation.

USING 
EMPLOYER-SPONSORED 
EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PRO-
GRAMS TO PAY OFF STUDENT 
DEBT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to talk about a 
national problem that has continued 
for years; that is the rise in student 
loan debt. Over 40 million borrowers 
hold outstanding student loan balances 
that exceed $1.7 trillion. The average 
borrower holds about $39,000 in student 
debt. 
This is unacceptable. We hear talk 
about pie-in-the-sky policies, like debt 
forgiveness, that come maybe from the 
other side of this Capitol or Chamber, 
what we call the U.S. Senate. These are 
not just pie-in-the-sky proposals; they 
are BS. They are not going to happen. 
It is time that Members of this body 
talk about the solutions that all of us 
here helped implement. We actually 
addressed the student debt issue. 
It is through legislation I led with 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
SCOTT 
PETERS of California, that was signed 
into law by President Trump last year, 
that would allow employers to make 
tax-free student loan payments of up to 
$5,250 per year to each employee who 
holds an eligible student loan, lowering 
payroll taxes both for employers and 
the employees. 
This 
public-private 
partnership 
model makes student loan payments 
eligible for employer-sponsored edu-
cational assistance programs, just like 
tuition assistance has been for years. 
In fact, my good friends at Chegg— 
and I have got four public universities 
in my district, four private universities 
in my district, and a handful of com-
munity colleges in my district—every 
one of those students, like my three 
kids who are in college right now and 
grad school, knows what Chegg is. That 
is where they are getting their books. 
It is a cost-effective, private-sector ap-
proach to lower the cost of textbooks 
for kids nationwide. 
Well, the people of Chegg know how 
important student debt is, because 
they have actually paid back over a 
million dollars in student debt for their 
employees. They have actually taken 
advantage of this program that we all 
passed in a bipartisan way to address 
this $1.7 trillion problem. 
Every employer out there should do 
what Chegg has done and take advan-
tage of the tax provisions that are in 
place and were put in place by Repub-
licans and Democrats and signed into 
law by President Trump. Let’s make 
sure that you use this as an effective 
recruitment tool and retention tool in 
this economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues to help get the word out to our 
employers across this great country to 
use what is already available to them 
and their employees who have student 
debt. They can use this student loan 
debt benefit to help recruit more work-
ers. They can use it to retain more tal-
ent. They can use it to give their em-
ployees financial freedom and make a 
real difference in their lives by reduc-
ing their student debt and by reducing 
the $1.7 trillion in debt that we have in 
this country, which outnumbers all 
auto and credit card debt combined. 
Help the employees. Help America. 
Let’s get this economy back on track. 
f 
WE NEED THE ESSENTIAL 
CAREGIVERS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as the colead of H.R. 3733, the Es-
sential Caregivers Act, to tell the sto-
ries of Americans across the country 
who are desperately calling on Con-
gress to immediately act on this bill. 
I also thank Representative LARSON, 
who is my colead, for helping me spon-
sor this bill. I am grateful to him for 
his leadership and his compassion. 
I have shared many heartbreaking 
and tragic stories before in this Cham-
ber, and I will continue to do so until 
there is action on my bipartisan Essen-
tial Caregivers Act. Just as so many 
families who were forced to helplessly 
watch as their loved ones rapidly de-
clined physically and mentally in long- 
term care facilities, I am not going to 
give up this fight. I am just getting 
started. 
First and foremost, the Essential 
Caregivers Act is a critically impor-
tant bill that would ensure the policies 
that were put in place during the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
never 
happen 
again. In my home State of New York, 
and many States across the Nation, 
families were literally shut out from 
their loved ones living in long-term 
care facilities, neglecting the basic 
needs of their loved ones at these fa-
cilities. These decisions to isolate long- 
term care facility residents were fatal 
and will have long-lasting impacts. 
Today, I am here to share stories 
that go beyond my home State of New 
York. I will begin by sharing a story 
from Alaska. This is an excerpt from 
the book entitled ‘‘Protecting Them to 
Death.’’ This is a book that was com-
piled and written by my great con-
stituent, Karla Abraham-Conley, who 
lost her mother in a long-term care fa-
cility. 
This is an excerpt from the book 
compiled using COVID–19 isolation sto-
ries. The first one is a story from 
Denise Brown: 
‘‘Ohana’’ means ‘‘family’’ in Hawaiian and 
that no one is left behind. This word means 
a lot to us. My mother’s skilled nursing fa-
cility was an hour away from her home and 
ours, so they became her pseudo ohana. 
She was moved there by the State of Alas-
ka when an employee brought COVID–19 into 
her extended care facility. She was able to 
see us through a window once or twice a 
week because she was on the ground floor at 
that time. We talked every day on the phone, 
except for those days when she was too weak 
to answer my call. Last year on her birth-
day, when she was in the final skilled nurs-
ing facility that the State had moved her to, 
we cooked her dinner outside her window, we 
sent it in to her via a CNA. My boys built her 
rock towers, and we sang ‘‘Happy Birthday’’ 
through the window. But the moment they 
moved my mother to the second floor, I 
think she gave up hope of getting stronger, 
of seeing the faces she loved through the 
window. It was her one connection to us that 
still seemed real and wasn’t through a vir-
tual visit. We lost her on January 12, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, Ms. Brown could still be 
here with us today if she had had ac-
cess to an essential caregiver. 
The next two stories come to us from 
Arizona. The first story is from Linda 
Thompson, also featured in the book 
‘‘Protecting Them to Death’’: 
My husband is in a memory care facility. 
He no longer speaks as a direct result of the 
isolation during the pandemic. He uses a 
walker. Because he was confined to his room, 
he was unable to exercise his legs. All his 
physical 
abilities 
have 
declined 
signifi-
cantly. Change of any kind takes a toll on 
dementia residents. Knowing that he spent 
17 days in a sterile room in the COVID–19 
ward of his facility is heartbreaking. He had 
very few symptoms but lost 20 pounds. I am 
still praying this never happens again.

December 1, 2021 
If he had access to his loved ones, 
Mrs. Thompson’s husband might still 
be speaking today. But the moment he 
was shut off from his essential care-
givers, his health took a devastating 
toll. 
Also from Arizona, here is the story 
from Anne Martinez, who lost her 
mother in the pandemic, also from the 
book ‘‘Protecting Them to Death’’: 
Every time I visited my mother, she 
looked like a zoo animal behind the patio 
door. She would mouth that she was hungry 
or motion for what I had brought to drink. 
The blueberries I left got moldy, the almond 
milk grew stale, and the canned organic 
soups gathered dust. Nobody was giving 
them to her. My dad gestured at the closed 
patio window how much he missed her, and 
she avoided eye contact so as not to cry. 
Some days I was allowed to bring home- 
cooked meals and other days I was not al-
lowed to feed her. 
On the day she was transferred to a hospice 
care facility, I was with her to say goodbye 
and could see the particles in her dentures 
that had not been cleaned in weeks and 
blackened food underneath her fingernails 
from trying to eat with her bare hands. 
I was actually relieved when they told me 
she had contracted COVID shortly after 
being vaccinated. Nobody deserves to spend 
their last years, months, weeks, or even 
days, alone in a facility without their loved 
ones at their side. 
Anne’s story is just one of thousands 
that are occurring across this Nation. 
I will continue sharing these stories 
and urging immediate passage of the 
bipartisan Essential Caregivers Act. 
Denise, Linda, Anne, and their fami-
lies, friends, and loved ones are depend-
ing on it.

HONORING ROBERT HAMILTON 
HURT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, it is with great pleasure that I rise 
today to honor a man who has dedi-
cated his life to a better Georgia and a 
better United States: Robert Hamilton 
Hurt. 
Bob Hurt is retiring this year, but his 
legacy will last generations. You would 
be hard-pressed to find a better adviser, 
more loyal friend, or hardworking foot 
soldier for every cause to which he has 
dedicated himself than Bob Hurt. This 
includes his commitment to his lovely 
wife, Virginia, and daughters Emma 
and Louisa, who are daily witnesses to 
Bob’s unwavering support. 
Bob is a proud graduate of Mercer 
University in Macon, Georgia, where he 
studied history. During this time re-
porting for and serving as editor for 
the campus newspaper, The Cluster, 
Bob both covered and advocated for the 
school’s desegregation. 
After graduating, Bob cashed in on a 
couple of summers interning for the 
Atlanta Constitution to score a full- 
time job reporting for the paper. 
That career was put on hold as Bob 
was commissioned as an officer for the 
United States Army through Mercer’s 
ROTC program and was then called to 
defend our Nation in Vietnam. 
While in Vietnam, he served as an 
Army infantryman and military intel-
ligence officer with the 173rd Airborne 
Brigade and with the 5th Special 
Forces, more commonly called the 
Green Berets. 
Bob returned to Atlanta following 
the war, where he continued his career 
as a journalist covering many beats be-
fore moving to Washington, D.C., to re-
port on the happenings inside this 
building for the people of Atlanta. 
While in Washington, Bob continued 
to pursue his goals while studying leg-
islative affairs at George Washington 
University, where he went on to re-
ceive a master’s degree. 
Bob left the Atlanta Constitution 
and began an illustrious career in the 
United States Congress working for 
both the House of Representatives and 
the United States Senate. 
Accumulating an incredible 24 years 
of combined experience, Bob has truly 
seen it all, but he never lost his com-
mitment to the people of his beloved 
Peach State. He served as chief of staff 
to two of my predecessors, Representa-
tive Bo Ginn and Lindsay Thomas, as 
well as staff director for Senator Sam 
Nunn. 
Though his dear friend Frank Norton 
may have convinced Bob to leave the 
government service, Bob never stopped 
working for our State. He has been a 
trusted adviser to Members on both 
sides of the aisle to further the inter-
ests of Georgians at the Federal level. 
For more than 40 years, Bob Hurt has 
had a hand in nearly every project to 
create jobs and improve lives in the 
First District of Georgia. He has also 
been a fierce advocate for our military 
installations and for ensuring Amer-
ica’s troops are the best equipped, 
highest trained, and most well cared 
for in the world. 
While he is the first to roll up his 
sleeves and commit to doing the hard 
things, Bob is the last person who will 
ever take credit for getting the job 
done. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to 
shine a light on this faithful public 
servant who I am honored to call my 
friend. 
Joining me in honoring Bob today 
are former Senator Sam Nunn and my 
predecessors Lindsay Thomas and Jack 
Kingston. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
their remarks. 
NOVEMBER 29, 2021. 
DEAR BOB: It is a pleasure to join with 
your family and many friends to congratu-
late you on your well-deserved retirement. (I 
don’t really believe it.) 
From your work at The Atlanta Constitu-
tion and your service in the U.S. Army—to 
your time as my Administrative Assistant in 
the Senate and your hard work at Hurt & 
Norton, 
you 
have 
had 
an 
outstanding, 
impactful, and I am sure, very fulfilling ca-
reer. In every role, you have served with dis-
tinction, integrity, and a great sense of 
humor, and you have been a force for good 
for Georgia and our nation. You’ve given all 
of us who have been blessed by your com-
pany a joyful example of how to live a won-
derful life. 
Considering your news media background, 
I am reluctant to admit that you are a su-
perb writer, so let’s put it this way: I am 
looking for a speechwriter for my own retire-
ment years. Are you available? I am honored 
that we’ve had the opportunity to work 
closely together over these many years, and 
I treasure our relationship. 
Thank you for your friendship, your lead-
ership, your wise counsel and your good 
jokes, which you have occasionally shared. 
Colleen and I send our best wishes to you and 
Virginia for a relaxing and enjoyable retire-
ment. She is the one who really deserves it, 
and we hope to see more of both of you on 
the Georgia coast! 
Sincerely, 
SAM NUNN. 
Though a newcomer to the political arena, 
I was well aware of the reputation and capa-
bilities of Bob Hurt long before he agreed to 
serve as my Chief of Staff. 
I cannot recall a serious disagreement that 
came between us throughout those ten years. 
There were surely times when my naı¨vete´ 
and lack of experience frustrated him great-
ly but never did it shake his steady, even- 
handed manner of directing the affairs of our 
office. 
Bob selected our staff, directed the budget, 
and inter-office proceedings and, with his es-
tablished knowledge of the First District, 
precluded any serious opposition during my 
ten years in office. His careful stewardship of 
the complex management challenges that 
face any congressional office enabled me to 
concentrate on focusing on the district and 
its people. In doing so, he afforded me the 
ability to spend the kind of time I found nec-
essary to keep our pulse on the sentiments of 
the people we represented and the agenda of 
the First District. 
I came to recognize how much respect Bob 
had on Capitol Hill. Other chiefs of staff and 
even other Members were aware of his 
knowledge, experience, and wisdom, seeking 
his counsel often. On many occasions I was 
perfectly aware of how Bob felt about var-
ious issues before us based on their questions 
of me. 
In serving former Congressman Bo Ginn 
before me and then Senator Sam Nunn after, 
I have often thought of what a contrast it 
must have been to take on the responsibility 
of such a novice as myself. He did so in a 
manner that helped me come to a resolution 
on controversial matters, on the gamut of 
ordinary issues that affected the nation and 
the First District, and on the mundane re-
sponsibility of assuring the people who elect-
ed me that our office was there to serve 
them in every way possible. 
Bob Hurt is a person of sterling character, 
very deep intellect, and passion for our na-
tion. He has exemplified that passion not 
only through his years as Chief of Staff for 
three Members of the United States Con-
gress, a Vietnam veteran, a father and fam-
ily man, and a consultant to some of the 
most important enterprises in the country, 
but also as a friend and trusted counsel to 
people who shape the nation’s agenda. 
He is a perfect example of a life well lived, 
and a person whose service has made our 
country a better place. 
I am truly honored to be his friend and I 
can say without reservation our longtime 
friendship and association has made me a 
better man.

Member of Congress (1983–1993),

Virginia but either way we in Georgia claim 
him as one of our most outstanding citizens. 
As a young man Bob played an integral 
volunteer role in the election of the late 
Congressman Bo Ginn. After Ginn was elect-
ed Bob stayed on as a staff member. Knowing 
the hours he worked and the reality of con-
gressional salaries, I’m sure the compensa-
tion was only slightly better than what he 
made as a volunteer! 
He worked grueling hours traveling the 
state of Georgia, meeting its people and 
dealing with the issues that most affected 
them. Along with Congressman Ginn, his 
successor Lindsay Thomas, and Sen. Sam 
Nunn, Bob was on the forefront of nearly 
every major public project for the last five 
decades. He helped push for the development 
and expansion of our ports, universities, 
military 
installations, 
countless 
roads, 
bridges, airports, and industries. As Georgia 
grew and prospered Bob never forgot the 
quality of life in which we all believe. He 
balanced environmental, rural, and urban 
dynamics so that generations to come will 
still be able to know and love the same Geor-
gia in which Bob was reared. 
In all of these achievements Bob never cut 
the ribbon or took the applause. He worked 
quietly behind the scenes and in most cases 
crafted the message and wrote the very 
speeches the elected officials gave as they 
accepted the accolades. 
After his retirement from Congressional 
life Bob continued his public service as a lob-
byist. I always describe Bob is a guy who 
charged you a dollar when he should’ve 
charged you two dollars and always gave you 
three dollars worth of work. He has been an 
example for many other public advocates. To 
Bob the mission is always primary, not the 
dollars or the political impact. 
Bob’s wife Virginia and daughters Emma 
and Louisa have been part of Bob’s contribu-
tion to a better Georgia. Bob puts his family 
first yet there been many sacrifices that all 
of them have made to make Bob a success. I 
hope Bob stays in the game but whatever the 
future holds he will be known as the premier 
and most successful public servant and lob-
byist on Capitol Hill.

Member of Congress (1993–2015),

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, Bob Hurt is a great Georgian. He is 
a great American. Most importantly 
for me, he is a great friend who has 
helped me tremendously, as he has 
helped so many people. 
I wish him well in his retirement. I 
know that he will be living in my dis-
trict. I look forward to representing 
him. We need more people in this world 
like Bob Hurt. We need more people in 
the United States and in Congress like 
Bob Hurt. 
I thank Bob for his tutelage and for 
all he has done for our great State and 
for our great Nation.

MEMORIAL GARDEN FOR RETIRED 
STATUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, State 
and local governments across the coun-
try are caving to woke demands and re-
moving 
statues 
of 
certain 
United 
States Presidents from their public 
buildings. Last week, Thomas Jeffer-
son’s 
statue—if 
you 
can 
imagine, 
Thomas Jefferson’s statue—was re-
moved from New York City’s City Hall. 
Radical leftists want these statues 
removed because their goal is to erase 
every part of our Nation’s history that 
doesn’t get their stamp of approval. 
They don’t want to see statues of his-
torical figures they don’t like. They 
don’t want you to see them, either, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Governments can decide what they 
want to display in public buildings, but 
what happens to the statues of Presi-
dents they remove? Will they get cov-
ered with a tarp or moved to a dusty 
corner of a basement somewhere? Or 
even worse than that, will they deco-
rate our country’s landfills? 
Instead of taking up space in some 
storage or waste facility, statues of 
U.S. Presidents that get removed from 
government buildings should go to a 
national memorial garden. That way 
they can still be viewed by people who 
want to see them and learn about those 
who led our country in the past. 
In fact, there is a pastor in my dis-
trict who is a good friend of mine; he is 
willing to take presidential statues 
that these politicians don’t want. Pas-
tor Clarence Sexton will start the na-
tional garden himself at Crown College 
in Powell, Tennessee, where he serves 
as president. 
Mr. Speaker, he has probably one of 
the best collections of United States 
memorabilia that I think I have seen 
outside of the Smithsonian and has let-
ters and autographs and things from 
every President since George Wash-
ington. 
The far left can pretend all it wants 
that these figures do not exist, but you 
cannot cancel history, Mr. Speaker. 
UFOS ARE OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, last 
summer’s UFO report from the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence was bogus. 
The report raised more questions than 
answers about unidentified objects in 
the skies. It stunk of a government 
coverup, Mr. Speaker. 
Now the Pentagon is starting a new 
office to collect information on these 
unidentified 
objects. 
The 
office 
is 
called the Airborne Object Identifica-
tion and Management Synchronization 
Group. I don’t know where they came 
up with that name. I am sure they paid 
somebody a lot of money to come up 
with that. 
I do not trust this new office, Mr. 
Speaker. I don’t think it will be trans-
parent with lawmakers or the public 
about its findings. This is a national 
security issue. Congress needs to know 
what is going on so we can respond ac-
cordingly. 
Today, I am requesting the leaders of 
this new office bring Members of Con-
gress in on their UFO findings. This is 
a matter of great public interest and 
has been for a very long time to a lot 
of Americans. Our government should 
not hide the truth from us for another 
second. 
If this new office is to be held ac-
countable, our country will get more 
reports like the one that came out last 
summer or, worse, they will be silent 
and hope we all just forget about the 
phenomena. 
We do not need to fear these airborne 
unidentified objects. They would have 
shown themselves to be dangerous a 
long time ago by now if they were a 
threat. Our citizens and country can 
handle the truth, Mr. Speaker. 
f 
PROTECTING WOMEN’S FREEDOMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, people sometimes ask me 
what was the greatest moment in my 
life. I have had a lot of great moments, 
but I will say three. The first was the 
birth of my son, Ben, and I would say 
the next two were the birth of my 
grandchildren, Ivo and Bruno. 
The decision for me to bring Ben into 
the world, the decision to raise a child, 
that was a personal decision made by 
me and my husband, and we didn’t 
have to call a Governor, we didn’t call 
a State legislator, we didn’t call our 
Member of Congress and say, hey, is it 
time? 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here to talk 
about freedom, freedom of everyone to 
have the right to make that very, very 
personal decision of whether or not to 
bring a child into the world, because 
we know the raising of a child brings so 
many blessings but also great responsi-
bility. None of us really know the indi-
vidual circumstances of other people. 
I raise that point today, Mr. Speaker, 
because as I stand here in the Chamber, 
across the street at the United States 
Supreme Court, the Court is hearing a 
case about a law in Mississippi that 
would effectively overturn the Roe v. 
Wade decision that has given women 
the right to access abortion for the 
past 50 years. 
That Mississippi law is an effort by 
Republican legislatures, and in this 
case the Mississippi legislature, to ban 
abortion. It is about politicians con-
trolling women’s bodies. It is about 
politicians taking away the personal 
decision 
of 
people 
to 
access 
the 
healthcare that they need. 
Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today 
and have trepidation whether or not 
the Supreme Court is going to uphold 
this right to access to abortion, it is a 
clarion call for the United States Sen-
ate across the hall to take up and pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
which we passed here in the House. 
That act would forever protect a wom-
an’s right to access a safe, legal abor-
tion. Let freedom ring.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, our God, we pause at the begin-
ning of the day’s business to acknowl-
edge You, to glorify You, and to sing 
the praises of Your name. 
For in this season of celebration and 
festivities, it is You who has spread a 
wondrous feast before us. For each and 
every person, You provide a banquet of 
graces; You fill us with the bounty of 
Your goodness. 
Long ago, You formed a plan, a won-
derful purpose, certain and sure, for 
our redemption from all that darkens 
our world and overwhelms our spirits. 
You desire our salvation from the 
shame of our suffering and the guilt in 
our hearts. 
When we seek shelter from the 
storm, You are our stronghold. When 
we need shade from the heat, You are 
our strength. 
When the words of the cruel are like 
a wintry blast, their insults like a 
scorching drought, You are our rescue. 
We wait upon You, O God our Savior. 
Wipe away the tears from our faces 
that we would be glad in Your presence 
and rejoice in the hope we have in You. 
In the power of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
(Ms. KUSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, the 
Supreme Court is poised to make one 
of the most consequential rulings for 
women and their bodies in over a gen-
eration. For nearly 50 years, women 
have come to rely upon the precedent 
of Roe v. Wade and the freedom to 
make their own reproductive decisions 
without government interference in 
our personal lives. Now our freedoms 
are under attack as the Court considers 
a case asking for Roe v. Wade to be 
overturned. 
As an adoption attorney for 25 years, 
I worked with more than 300 birth 
mothers making the most difficult and 
personal decision of their lives. They 
consulted family, loved ones, and doc-
tors, but not one birth mother looked 
to the government to make that choice 
for her. 
Earlier this year we passed the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, legislation 
to codify the constitutional right to 
safe, legal abortion. Regardless of the 
Court’s decision, we must make this 
bill law to permanently protect the re-
productive freedoms of women across 
this land. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DEBI BUTLER WITH 
BRAIN HEALTH NOW 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Debi Butler 
with Brain Health Now. Debi is leading 
an effort to end the stigma surrounding 
mental illness by shifting the conversa-
tion to brain health. 
As a parent and former educator, I 
know how important it is to pay close 
attention to brain health. Today, one 
in five Americans suffer from behav-
ioral health conditions, such as depres-
sion and PTSD. The majority of these 
people will not seek treatment, partly 
due to the stigma that surrounds brain 
health. Tragically, this leads to sui-
cides being up and the second leading 
cause of death amongst people aged 10 
to 34. 
Brain health should be treated the 
same way as physical health, and while 
I am glad to have seen many strides in 
this session, we have more work to do. 
I am grateful for Debi, and I look for-
ward to working together on this crit-
ical issue that we can all call things 
brain health. 
f 
DOBBS V. JACKSON WOMEN’S 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I just left the 
Supreme Court where people were 
chanting: 
liberate 
abortion 
every-
where. 
Earlier today and right now the Su-
preme Court is hearing a case chal-
lenging Mississippi’s 15-week abortion 
ban. During oral arguments, the State 
of Mississippi repeatedly asked the 
Court to overturn its own long-held 
precedent for 58 years in Roe v. Wade. 
Should that happen, more than 36 
million people in 26 States would im-
mediately be deprived of the right to 
abortion overnight. These restrictions 
mostly harm people of color, young 
people, and people of low-income. 
Earlier this year, in anticipation of 
this Court case, the House passed the 
Women’s Health Protection Act which 
would establish a statutory right to 
abortion care across our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues and the Senate to pass this leg-
islation immediately so that all people 
are free to make their own decisions 
about their bodies. There is no democ-
racy in this country if women cannot 
make 
decisions 
about 
their 
own 
healthcare and their bodies. 
f 
CONGRATULATING DAN GLESSING, 
14TH PRESIDENT OF THE MIN-
NESOTA FARM BUREAU FEDERA-
TION 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Dan Glessing, 
the newest president of the Minnesota 
Farm Bureau Federation. Dan has 
served as vice president and as a mem-
ber of the Minnesota Farm Bureau 
board for more than 8 years. He re-
cently was elected to serve as the 14th 
president of the bureau on November 19 
following the announcement of Kevin 
Paap’s retirement in March after serv-
ing 16 years in his position as presi-
dent. 
Our office and I personally have been 
fortunate to know and work with Dan 
for many years already. Dan and his 
family are the definition of the great 
American farming tradition. He has al-
ways been a steadfast advocate for our 
State’s farmers and producers. I am 
proud that Dan, his wife, Seena, and 
the entire Glessing family call Min-
nesota’s Sixth District home. 
There are many challenges ahead for 
Dan, but I know he will continue to be 
a leader for all of Minnesota’s farmers, 
ranchers, 
producers, 
and 
agri-
businesses. I congratulate Dan on his 
new leadership role, and I look forward 
to working with him and everyone at 
the Minnesota Farm Bureau on behalf 
of Minnesota’s agriculture community.

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE 
HANGS IN THE BALANCE 
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, this 
morning oral arguments began at the 
Supreme Court for a case that many 
expect could overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Despite nearly 50 years of Court 
precedent and overwhelming public 
support for abortion rights, Roe and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6724 
December 1, 2021 
access 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare 
hangs in the balance. 
This issue is deeply personal to the 
women I represent in New Hampshire, 
and the last thing they want to see is 
a politician or a judge taking away 
their bodily autonomy. We are better 
off as a country with Roe as the law of 
the land. It supports the health and 
economic well-being of women and 
families. Still, we know that legisla-
tures and Governors from Mississippi 
to Texas to New Hampshire are enact-
ing extreme laws that punish doctors 
and take away women’s rights. This 
must be stopped. 
That is why, regardless of what hap-
pens in this case, it is essential that 
the Senate joins the House in passing 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
My constituents and the American peo-
ple want abortion to be safe, legal, and 
accessible. This legislation will uphold 
that concept for the country even if 
the Court abandons it. 
f 
OPPOSING THE ELIMINATION OF 
CASH BAIL 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, increas-
ingly across this Nation and here in 
Washington, the voices of victims are 
being drowned out by radicals on the 
left seeking to eliminate cash bail. 
These people would rather see crimi-
nals walk free on our streets than see 
the rule of law upheld and our commu-
nities protected. 
Without appropriate incentives to ap-
pear before the court, we run the risk 
of defendants fleeing justice while vic-
tims and their families are left with 
nothing but fear and anguish. 
We cannot allow our system to fail 
them as it did in Waukesha, Wisconsin. 
Prior to plowing into a Christmas pa-
rade, convicted felon and career crimi-
nal, Darrell Brooks, was released on an 
inappropriately low $1,000 bond after 
being arrested on a slew of charges. 
That is astonishing to me. With his 
record, Mr. Brooks’ bail should have 
never been so low, if awarded at all. 
So the next time my colleagues 
across the aisle suggest eliminating 
the cash bail system, I ask them to 
think of this tragedy and of the vic-
tims. Our bail system keeps criminals 
off the streets and our communities 
safe. 
f 
NETHERLAND-AMERICA 
FOUNDATION 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, 100 
years ago today a group of Dutch 
Americans, including future President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, established 
the Netherland-America Foundation to 
strengthen ties between our two great 
countries. Over the past 100 years the 
Netherland-America 
Foundation 
has 
accomplished this mission through or-
ganizing and sponsoring cultural ex-
change programs on topics as varied as 
art and science to business, public af-
fairs, and historic preservation. 
As the son of a Dutch immigrant, I 
am honored to cochair, with my col-
league Representative HUIZENGA, the 
bipartisan Dutch Caucus which shares 
NAF’s goals of growing and deepening 
the exchange of ideas and culture be-
tween America and Holland. 
A similar message of friendship and 
goodwill is being delivered to the 
Dutch Parliament today, speaking to 
the ever-deepening bond between our 
two countries and great democracies. 
I know I speak on behalf of all mem-
bers of the Dutch Caucus when I con-
gratulate 
the 
foundation 
on 
their 
achievements over the past 100 years 
and the lasting impact they have had 
in encouraging the unique friendship 
between our two countries. I look for-
ward to another century of the U.S. 
and Netherlands sharing, growing, and 
working together.

REDBANK VALLEY TRAILS 
ASSOCIATION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate the Redbank Valley Trails 
Association for winning the 2021 Thom-
as Petri Recreational Trails Program 
Achievement Award. This award recog-
nizes top-notch projects that use rec-
reational trails program funds to im-
prove local trails. 
In 2018, the Redbank Valley Trails 
Association and Allegheny Valley Land 
Trust completed the Climax Tunnel 
Rehabilitation project. Because the 
Redbank Valley Trail is a former rail 
corridor, much of the trail consists of 
old bridges and stone archways. To 
keep the trail functional and safe, re-
storing the tunnels, bridges, and arches 
are necessary. 
Located in western Pennsylvania, the 
Redbank Valley Trail is a 51-mile non- 
motorized trail maintained mainly by 
volunteers. 
Madam Speaker, after spending 30 
years in the healthcare field before 
coming to Congress, I understand the 
importance of physical activity to 
maintain 
a 
healthy 
lifestyle. 
The 
Redbank Valley Trail is a great option 
for residents and visitors alike to ex-
plore the great outdoors. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the Allegheny Land Trust for their 
dedication to keeping the Redbank 
Valley Trail healthy and accessible for 
years to come.

DOBBS V. JACKSON WOMEN’S 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, today the Supreme Court is 
hearing oral arguments for the case 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Or-
ganization. This case is the first time 
in 50 years that the Court is hearing a 
case that directly challenges Roe v. 
Wade. 
Half of the States in the country are 
poised to ban abortion entirely if the 
Court overturns Roe through trigger 
laws. Everyone should have the free-
dom to make their own reproductive 
healthcare decisions—not politicians. 
Now, I am one of the one in four 
women who have had an abortion. I re-
member the days when abortion was 
criminalized way before Roe v. Wade. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I survived. But 
many women, especially Black women, 
died. We will not go back to the days of 
unsafe abortions. These lives impact 
everyone but have a disproportionate 
impact on Black, Latina, indigenous 
people, and people of color. 
This also is about economic justice, 
racial equity, and the freedom to make 
decisions over one’s life and one’s re-
productive healthcare. Abortions must 
be safe, they must be legal, and they 
must be accessible. The Senate must 
pass Congresswoman JUDY CHU’s Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act so we can 
ensure that we protect the right to 
safe, legal, and accessible abortions. 
f 
RELIGIOUS CONTRACTORS FINAL 
RULE 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I stand 
in strong opposition to the Department 
of Labor’s attack on religious freedom. 
The Department of Labor’s proposal to 
rescind protections for religious Fed-
eral contractors demonstrates how hos-
tile the Biden administration is to the 
free exercise of religion when it bucks 
up against progressive priorities. 
Prior to President Trump’s rule 
clarifying the rights and obligations of 
religious Federal contractors, religious 
organizations were reluctant to seek 
Federal contracts. If the rule is re-
scinded, religious organizations will, 
once again, be dissuaded from com-
peting for these contracts. This will 
lead to less competition for Federal 
contracts, meaning the American peo-
ple will pay a higher price for Federal 
projects. 
Religious organizations should be 
able to compete for contracts on a level 
playing field without having to com-
promise their faith. The Biden adminis-
tration apparently disagrees. It is of 
the utmost importance to protect our 
very first right—the religious freedom 
of all Americans—including Federal 
contractors.

for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in celebration of Josephine 
Baker, a daughter of Harlem and be-
loved in France, who, in her wake, 
made 
history 
yesterday. 
Josephine 
Baker became a bridge between France 
and the United States, especially in the 
fight against discrimination. 
She was an artist, a civil rights lead-
er, a World War II resistance fighter, 
shining bright both on stage and off it. 
She was a woman of countless firsts: 
the first onstage, the first in the mov-
ies, and the first Black woman to break 
the rules and shatter the glass ceilings. 
Yesterday, she became another first, 
the first American-born, first Black 
woman, and first entertainer to be in-
ducted into the French Pantheon. She 
joins nearly 80 luminaries in this Paris 
monument, where she will continue to 
be a bright light for all of us. 
I commend the French people and 
President Macron and thank them so 
much for keeping the legacy of Jose-
phine Baker alive. Thank you so much. 
Merci beaucoup.

BIDEN BUILD BACK BANKRUPT 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden-supported, 
Democrat-passed, irresponsible spend-
ing scheme is the most reckless tax 
and spending bill in history. 
Americans are suffering from Biden 
inflation, and build back bankrupt will 
make it worse. Young Americans will 
be saddled with unimaginable debt, de-
stroying jobs. For older Americans, 
Biden inflation is devaluing retirement 
accounts, undermining Social Secu-
rity, and compromising Medicare. 
House Democrats have misled Ameri-
cans about the cost. The Congressional 
Budget Office says it will add $367 bil-
lion to the deficit. All this confirms 
that the Democrat elite think they are 
smarter than everyone and think Dem-
ocrat voters are ignorant to believe 
that $4.5 trillion costs zero dollars. 
They pay with Biden inflation. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from the Afghani-
stan safe haven to America. 
Remember the Waukesha murders in 
Wisconsin.

DOBBS V. JACKSON WOMEN’S 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
(Ms. STRICKLAND asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
today, the Supreme Court is hearing 
one of the most important abortion 
rights cases in generations. The case, 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Or-
ganization, marks the first time in 50 
years the Court agreed to hear a case 
on 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
a 
previability abortion ban. In other 
words, the State of Mississippi has 
asked the Supreme Court to overturn 
Roe v. Wade. 
Let me be clear. Reproductive health 
access is a fundamental right. This is 
about supporting body autonomy and 
well-being. It is also about economic 
justice and social freedom. The people 
hurt most by abortion restrictions and 
bans are those who already face bar-
riers to getting access to healthcare: 
women, people of color, those working 
to make ends meet, members of the 
LGBTQI 
community, 
immigrants, 
young people, those in rural commu-
nities, people with disabilities, and 
others. 
We can look to the State of Texas as 
a real-life example. Texas has banned 
almost all abortions in the State, forc-
ing people to travel across State lines 
to receive care. 
Now is the time for the Supreme 
Court to show that it decides cases 
based on precedent and the rule of law, 
not politics, not ideology. Every person 
should be free to make their best 
healthcare 
decisions 
regardless 
of 
where they live.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
THE 
MEMORY 
OF 
AMERICAN 
HERO MICHAEL FREELAND 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the memory of an American 
hero, Jacksonville Fire and Rescue En-
gineer Michael Freeland. 
On November 11, Engineer Freeland 
tragically lost his life while saving an-
other life at the scene of a horrible ac-
cident. He died as he lived: a hero. He 
was 36 years old. 
Engineer Freeland was a firefighter 
with Jacksonville Fire and Rescue for 7 
years and was assigned to Station 73. 
He is an example of the best of Amer-
ica: a hero who dedicated his life to the 
service of others. 
Our community mourns this great 
loss, and our hearts are with his family 
and friends. I pray that his sacrifice 
will never be forgotten and that his 
loved ones may find peace in this dif-
ficult time. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House 
observe a moment of silence. 
f 
ENACTING ROSA PARKS DAY 
(Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, I rise today in honor of the mem-
ory of Rosa Parks, our Nation’s great-
est hero. 
It has been 66 years, Madam Speaker, 
since Rosa Parks refused to give up her 
seat for a White rider, sparking her ar-
rest and the beginning of the civil 
rights movement. 
My Congressional Black Caucus col-
league, Congresswoman Representative 
SEWELL, is the original cosponsor of 
the Rosa Parks Day Act, a bill that 
would make December 1 a Federal holi-
day in her honor, along with Congress-
man JIM COOPER and I. 
Many of you may not know, but 17 
years ago, through my leadership, Ohio 
was the first in the Nation to pass Rosa 
Parks Day legislation. Our district will 
celebrate this year’s Rosa Parks Day 
on December 13 in a celebration called 
‘‘The Power of One: You.’’ 
So please join me and my colleagues 
in supporting the Rosa Parks Day Act 
to honor a great American. This is our 
power. This is our message. 
f 
OPEN BORDERS PLUS AMNESTY IS 
THE END OF OUR COUNTRY 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Joe Biden’s open-border poli-
cies have created a crisis on our border 
not seen in over 30 years. And what are 
the Democrats doing to address this 
worsening border crisis? They just 
passed through a multitrillion-dollar 
spending bill with mass amnesty for up 
to 10 million illegal immigrants, plus 
$100 billion in taxpayer-funded bene-
fits. 
This far-left, socialist reconciliation 
package provides zero funding for bor-
der wall construction, technology, or 
additional Border Patrol agents. 
While border arrests are at an all- 
time high with no signs of stopping, 
our border czar, Vice President HARRIS, 
who has yet to be seen, has no solu-
tions that would end the crisis on our 
border. Instead, Biden and HARRIS con-
tinue to incentivize illegal immigra-
tion at the expense of all Americans. 
Open borders plus amnesty is the end 
of our great country as we know it. 
f 
WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
CHOOSE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today, 
the Supreme Court is hearing argu-
ments on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health 
Organization, 
a 
case 
that 
threatens abortion access throughout 
the country, not just in Mississippi 
where the case originated. 
I walked over to see the protesters, 
the demonstrators, the supporters, and 
the objectors. There is a lot of con-
troversy, but the fact is, standing law 
in the United States, stare decisis, is 
that women have a right to choose. 
It is a personal right, and it is en-
shrined in Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade 
was enunciated, passed, and approved 
by the Supreme Court when I was in 
law school. The right of a woman to

choose is part of my political DNA. I 
hope it never changes. 
One of the Justices asked one of the 
attorneys addressing the Court: Why 
don’t we just leave it to the States? 
Well, one of the last times Mis-
sissippi and its confederate States, all 
of which have abortion laws that would 
go into effect if Roe v. Wade was out-
lawed—the issue was ‘‘leave it to the 
States on slavery.’’ That was wrong 
then, and it is wrong now. Women have 
the right to choose. 
f 
AMERICORPS FUNDING 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we could talk forever about this Build 
Back Better bill, but I am going to 
shine a light on an underpublicized pro-
vision in there. 
I believe in the last month, for the 
first time, we hit $29 trillion in debt. 
So one would figure on any spending 
bill that goes through this House, we 
should be really conservative when it 
comes to spending more money. 
AmeriCorps is a program that right 
now we spend about $1 billion a year 
on. In this bill, we are going from $1 
billion a year to $4 billion a year. We 
are quadrupling the amount of money 
spent on a program that is fraught 
with 
fraud, 
people 
taking 
large 
amounts of money out of the program. 
Also, people are falsifying timesheets 
to get benefits they aren’t entitled to. 
Meanwhile, the inspector general can-
not do an appropriate job of inves-
tigating fraud because they aren’t even 
turning over records from the past. 
If there is one program that ought to 
be looked at carefully, it would be this. 
Instead of paying more attention to 
fraud in the program, we are quad-
rupling the size of the program, not to 
mention it is hurting people. 
f 
TAX AND SPENDING SPREE 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, the 
massive social spending bill the House 
passed just 2 weeks ago is a disaster for 
our future. If the policies in the build 
back framework are made permanent, 
this spending would amount to $4.12 
trillion over the next 10 years. 
I always say that other Members of 
Congress who write these bills must 
not know how to count because the 
revenue for this bill is just not there. 
We should not spend more than what 
we have. Families don’t run their 
households this way. The government 
shouldn’t either. 
I do not want my kids and grandkids 
paying for this irresponsible spending. 
Americans are already experiencing 
record-high inflation. 
The trillions in new spending will 
only make costs higher. I continue to 
fight against the government taking 
more of our hard-earned money. 
RISING INFLATION HARMS 
FAMILIES 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, ris-
ing inflation is continuing to harm 
families and communities across the 
country. 
Americans are paying 30 percent 
more to heat their homes this winter 
and 11 percent more for their elec-
tricity bills. The Central Valley gas 
prices are nearly $5 per gallon. The 
cost of housing is rising, and grocery 
bills are historically high. 
Madam Speaker, Americans are pay-
ing more just to keep food on their 
table. Meanwhile, the House majority 
and the administration continue to add 
to this problem with reckless, out-of- 
control spending by implementing irre-
sponsible and shortsighted economic 
policies. 
These spending packages will hurt 
our economy by drastically increasing 
our record-high inflation rates and will 
continue to cripple generations to 
come by passing on more debt to our 
future Americans. 
I urge my colleagues in the majority 
to act urgently and work across the 
aisle to address this out-of-control in-
flation.

IN SUPPORT OF THE ARECIBO 
OBSERVATORY 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Arecibo Observatory one year after the 
collapse of the former 305-meter radio 
telescope. 
For 57 years, the radio telescope pro-
vided for the advancement of scientific 
research and development, supported 
STEM education, and fostered multiple 
discoveries that helped us better under-
stand our planet and the surrounding 
universe. 
News and footage of the shattered 
telescope has deeply impacted those 
who have worked, studied, visited, or 
knew about this feature of the facility 
since 1963. 
We must now focus on what lies 
ahead. 
Congress must continue recognizing 
the significant asset our Nation had in 
this instrument, as we work with rel-
evant Federal agencies to move for-
ward and, most importantly, build on 
the capabilities we once had with the 
former telescope.

THE 
CONSTITUTION 
DOES 
PRO-
TECT 
AN 
UNBORN 
CHILD’S 
RIGHT TO LIFE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, 
the United States Supreme Court will 
hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health 
Organization, a major pro-life case that 
focuses on protecting the unborn, not 
restricting the rights of women. 
Instead of prioritizing the abortion 
industry, we as a Nation should be fo-
cused on prioritizing the sanctity of 
human life. 
As the father to two sons, Guy and 
Sam, and having lost a son, Mack 
Wayne, at 19 weeks in the womb, I 
strongly believe life begins at concep-
tion and that an unborn child is a 
human life. 
Thanks to modern medical advance-
ment, we know that: at 5 weeks, un-
born babies have a heartbeat; at 10 
weeks, unborn babies have developed 
arms and legs and fingers and toes; at 
12 weeks, unborn babies feel pain; at 15 
weeks, unborn babies have a fully de-
veloped heart. 
This landmark case gives the Su-
preme Court a chance to correct the 
mistake it made nearly 50 years ago 
and the opportunity to acknowledge 
that our Constitution does protect an 
unborn child’s right to life.

penalties for trafficking Tribal cul-
tural patrimony and will explicitly 
prohibit the export of such objects. 
The STOP Act will establish Federal 
frameworks to assist in the repatri-
ation of stolen Tribal objects between 
Federal agencies and Tribal govern-
ments. 
Due to colonization, it is no secret 
that the exploitation of Native Amer-
ican cultural items, like human re-
mains, sacred objects, and other tools, 
have been looted and sold to collectors 
around the world. 
In the 1970s, the Pueblo of Acoma in 
New Mexico had their sacred Acoma 
shield stolen during a robbery on Trib-
al lands. 
Imagine the Tribe’s surprise when 
their sacred Acoma shield was sched-
uled for sale to the highest bidder at 
the 
Eve 
Auction 
House 
in 
Paris, 
France. 
Thanks to an outpouring of support 
and diplomatic pleas against the auc-
tion house, the sale was stopped. But 
incidents like this will continue to 
occur without a codified method to 
hold traffickers of cultural patrimony 
accountable. 
While the Acoma shield is one exam-
ple where the sale did not go through, 
there are countless and numerous 
other 
undiscovered 
and 
unreported 
cases where Tribal cultural artifacts 
and items are sold or auctioned in pure 
disrespect for their proper ownership 
and place of reverence. 
Cultural items belonging to Native 
Americans 
and 
Native 
Hawaiians 
should no longer be considered relics of 
the past and available to sell to the 
highest bidder. 
It is time for our country to cele-
brate the cultural items and protect 
them from exploitation. 
The STOP Act will: Direct the De-
partment of the Interior to convene an 
interagency working group; 
Refer individuals and organizations 
to Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations to facilitate the vol-
untary return of human remains and 
cultural items; and 
Convene a Native American working 
group with representatives from Indian 
Tribes and Native Hawaiian organiza-
tions to provide advice on issues con-
cerning the return of and illegal trade 
in human remains and cultural items. 
The United States is a signatory to 
an international treaty that entrusts 
the Federal Government with sup-
porting the repatriation of other coun-
tries’ tribal objects. We do it for other 
countries, but we don’t do it for our 
own. 
Our Native American Tribes and Na-
tive Hawaiians do not have the same 
statutory mechanism to prevent cul-
tural sacred items in the United States 
from going overseas to other countries. 
The STOP Act requires the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the Depart-
ment of State to each designate a liai-
son to facilitate and hold trainings and 
workshops on the voluntary return of 
human remains and cultural items. 
The bill reflects significant com-
promises and adjustments to accommo-
date concerns of antiquity dealers and 
has gone through 20 amendments. I was 
pleased to see these efforts recognized 
with passage in committee by unani-
mous consent. 
This version reflects negotiations 
with Tribal leaders, Federal agency ex-
perts, and the Authentic Tribal Art 
Dealers Association. As many know, 
New Mexico holds the largest Indian 
art market where artists sell their 
beautiful creations. The Southwestern 
Association for Indian Arts, SWAIA, 
has declared their support for the 
STOP Act. 
Passage of the STOP Act will allow 
the United States to strengthen its 
ability to prohibit the exportation of 
Native American and Native Hawaiian 
cultural items. Let’s not forget that 
Native American and Native Hawaiian 
history is our country’s history. 
The protection of these cultural 
items must be a priority for our coun-
try, because once they are stolen and 
taken out of our country, they become 
lost to those who revere them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the swift 
adoption of H.R. 2930, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, Congress has long 
recognized the importance of Native 
American Tribal cultural items and 
their historical, traditional, and cul-
tural importance to Native American 
Tribes. 
Approximately 137 million Native 
American artifacts, works of art, and 
specimens are in the Smithsonian’s 
collections according to the Govern-
ment Accountability Office. 
Both the Archaeological Resources 
Protection Act and the Native Amer-
ican Graves Protection and Repatri-
ation Act provide a legal framework 
for the repatriation of human remains 
and cultural items to Indian Tribes. 
While these two statutes have great-
ly reduced the sale of cultural items 
within the United States, many items 
have appeared in European auctions 
where they have little legal protection 
from being sold. 
In recent years, Paris auction houses 
facilitated the sale of Hopi, Navajo, 
and Acoma Tribal masks and ceremo-
nial items. 
The U.S. Government attempted to 
intervene to prevent the sales, but the 
French government and the auction 
houses maintained that they were 
legal. 
In response to this problem, former 
Congressman Steve Pearce introduced 
a concurrent resolution in March of 
2016 condemning these sales and re-
questing that the U.S. Comptroller 
General conduct a report on the issue. 
The Safeguard Tribal Objects of Pat-
rimony Act, or the STOP Act, would 
expand legal protections to Native 
American Tribal artifacts and sacred 
objects by increasing criminal pen-
alties for repeat traffickers of Native 
American human remains or cultural 
items and banning the export of ille-
gally obtained items. 
The 
Department 
of 
the 
Interior 
would be required to form an inter-
agency working group to facilitate re-
patriation of items and protect items 
currently in an Indian Tribe’s posses-
sion. 
To incentivize repatriation, the bill 
would allow immunity from prosecu-
tion if an individual voluntarily sur-
renders to the appropriate Tribe the 
Native American cultural objects in his 
or her possession within 2 years of en-
actment. 
I want to thank the sponsor of the 
legislation for working with stake-
holders impacted by this bill, including 
the Acoma, the Pueblo, the Antique 
Tribal Art Dealers Association, the De-
partment of the Interior, the Depart-
ment of Justice, and others. 
It is important that we protect items 
of cultural and historic significance to 
our Indian Tribes. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I, too, wish to thank the really in-
credible support and working relation-
ship that we have developed with the 
ranking member and other members of 
the committee. This is a bipartisan 
bill, and it has taken some work to get 
it where it is today, but I think that we 
are all supportive of it. 
The really wonderful thing is that 
when I am home in New Mexico, I am 
asked about this bill repeatedly, be-
cause the Nations want to see their 
works protected. 
These are cultural items that belong 
with those who know how to revere 
them, who know how to protect them, 
who know how to care for them. It is 
something that you will hear Tribes 
across this country, not only in New 
Mexico, ask Congress to take action 
on. I am very pleased that we are tak-
ing action today on the STOP Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I encourage adoption of this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation. I see that in the 
Chamber, 
we 
have 
Representative 
YOUNG, who is a cosponsor. I would also 
like to thank Representatives COLE 
and RADEWAGEN for joining in this bill. 
It does have bipartisan support. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2930, as amended. 
The question was taken.

REAFFIRMING THE AUTHORITY OF

Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules

the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the 
authority of the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to take land into trust for Indian 
Tribes, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4352 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY.

and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes.

woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4352 amends 
section 19 of the Indian Reorganization 
Act to allow the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to take land into trust for feder-
ally recognized Indian Tribes regard-
less of their date of recognition. 
Over a decade ago, in the Carcieri v. 
Salazar case, the Supreme Court held 
that the Secretary of the Interior’s au-
thority under the Indian Reorganiza-
tion Act to place land into trust for a 
Tribe applies only to Tribes that were 
under Federal jurisdiction in 1934. 
Before the Carcieri decision, the De-
partment of the Interior, under pre-
vious administrations, had consist-
ently interpreted the Indian Reorga-
nization Act as authorizing the Depart-
ment to take land into trust for any 
Tribe as long as the Tribe was federally 
recognized at the time of its land-into- 
trust application. 
Placing land into trust is vital for 
Tribal sovereignty and self-determina-
tion. We must remember that most of 
the land sought to be placed in trust is 
actually historic land, aboriginal land 
of the Tribes themselves, and they are 
simply seeking to reacquire it and to 
have the same trust protections placed 
on that land as their other land. 
Placing land into trust also confers 
important protections, benefits, and 
flexibility for Tribes, including protec-
tions essential for supporting Tribal 
cultural practices and well-being as 
well as their ability to exercise juris-
diction over that land. 
However, the Carcieri decision over-
turned 75 years of Department of the 
Interior practice by holding that the 
Indian Reorganization Act provided the 
Interior Department with authoriza-
tion to take land into trust only for 
Tribes that were federally recognized 
at the time of the enactment of the In-
dian Reorganization Act of 1934. 
As a result, the Court’s decision cre-
ated a two-tier system of the haves and 
have nots among federally recognized 
Tribes applying for trust land acquisi-
tion. 
Now, Tribes that have been recog-
nized after 1934 cannot apply with the 
Interior 
Department 
to 
have 
land 
taken into trust. Instead, each of these 
Tribes must seek new legislation from 
Congress every single time they have a 
similar land request. 
We have already seen the real-world 
consequences of the Carcieri decision, 
as year after year Congress has to pass 
stand-alone bills for individual Tribes 
on a piecemeal basis to protect their 
lands. In fact, in a few moments we 
will consider exactly such a bill. 
The Carcieri decision also opened up 
Tribes to costly lawsuits regarding 
land that they have held in trust for 
years, sometimes decades. It has taken 
almost a century for us to begin 
undoing the damage we inflicted on our 
Nation’s indigenous peoples upon colo-
nial contact. 
The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act 
was an important step in that healing 
process with the Tribes, but we now 
know that our work is not yet done. We 
are 
still 
federally 
acknowledging 
Tribes to this day. We passed a Tribal 
recognition bill here in the House on 
November 1. 
To this day, Congress is still working 
to right many wrongs from the Federal 
Government. We are still striving to 
return a portion, just a small portion 
of the land back to the Tribes. 
To say that Tribes federally recog-
nized after 1934 are somehow inferior to 
Tribes federally recognized before is 
dangerously ignorant of the idea that 
we right now are on Indian land. 
H.R. 4352, introduced by the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM), will right this wrong and amend 
the Indian Reorganization Act to en-
sure 
that 
all 
federally 
recognized 
Tribes are treated equally, regardless 
of their date of recognition. 
For more than a decade, the Carcieri 
decision has caused anxiety and confu-
sion in Indian Country. It has created 
dangerous legal ambiguities related to 
Indian trust lands. 
Passing this bill will remove the am-
biguity and uncertainty surrounding 
land into trust and finally offer all 574 
federally 
recognized 
Tribal 
nations 
peace of mind that their lands can be 
protected. 
I urge the swift adoption of the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as the gentlewoman 
described, this is a very complex issue 
with a long history behind it. H.R. 4352 
would reverse a 2009 Supreme Court de-
cision, Carcieri v. Salazar, which held 
that the Indian Reorganization Act 
does not authorize the Secretary of the 
Interior to acquire land in trust for 
Tribes that were not under Federal ju-
risdiction in 1934 when the act was 
passed. 
The Carcieri decision created vast 
uncertainty over the fee-to-trust proc-
ess for Tribes and impacted stake-
holders. Since the decision was handed 
down, there has been no resolution in 
this incredibly complex issue. 
Lands taken into trust are extremely 
important to Tribes. Tribes’ desire to 
increase their Tribal land base and help

their communities must be respected. 
There are certain benefits and advan-
tages afforded to Tribes having lands 
that are held in trust. 
But we should be clear that even 
prior to Carcieri, the fee-to-trust proc-
ess was far from perfect. We should not 
ignore the larger need to improve the 
process. 
Many have argued the current Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs process provides 
very limited incentive for community 
stakeholders to be partners and places 
little requirement on the BIA to ana-
lyze the impacts of a fee-to-trust deci-
sion on nearby communities or Tribes, 
often resulting in unresolved conflicts 
and litigation at the local level. 
For the last decade, county govern-
ments have been asking us to reform 
this process. Their concerns with the 
tax, zoning, and community impacts of 
trust land acquisition have been well 
documented. 
While this bill addresses the imme-
diate impacts of the Carcieri decision, 
if this bill becomes law, nothing will 
have changed to address the larger 
issues with the fee-to-trust process. 
Congress should address the impacts of 
the Carcieri decision and enact needed 
reforms to improve the fee-to-trust 
process. Tribes and all stakeholders de-
serve as much, and I look forward to 
working with them on this important 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to offer my grati-
tude to the next speaker for the hard 
work she has put into this bill so that 
we can resolve this issue now and into 
the future. 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM). 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico for the generosity of the time. 
As the author of H.R. 4352, I rise to 
encourage all of my colleagues to join 
in this bipartisan effort to end dis-
crimination against Tribal nations and 
to ensure that all 574 federally recog-
nized Tribal nations have the equal 
ability to restore their homelands 
through the Department of the Inte-
rior’s fee-to-trust process. 
This bill would confirm Congress’ in-
tent that the Indian Reorganization 
Act authorizes the Secretary of the In-
terior to place land into trust for all 
federally recognized Tribal nations, re-
gardless of their date of recognition. 
Let’s be clear, what is at the heart of 
this bipartisan legislation is equality. 
All 574 federally recognized Tribal na-
tions deserve to have equal access to 
the Federal process for restoring their 
homelands. 
The 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court’s 
2009 
Carcieri decision violated this equality 
principle by forcing a two-tier system 
for the Department of the Interior’s 
fee-to-trust process: One process for 
Tribal nations federally recognized be-
fore 1934 and a different process for 
Tribal nations recognized after 1934. 
Carcieri imposed on federally recog-
nized Tribal nations an unfair, sepa-
rate, and unequal process, a fundamen-
tally discriminatory process for restor-
ing their homelands. Now is the time 
for Congress to fix this blatant dis-
crimination against Tribal nations. 
For over a decade now, Tribal govern-
ments and Native American organiza-
tions have prioritized a clean Carcieri 
fix. 
The president of the National Con-
gress of American Indians, Ms. Fawn 
Sharp, made the following statement, 
‘‘Carcieri has effectively created two 
classes of Tribal nations and has over-
burdened Tribal, Federal, and State re-
sources by generating unnecessary con-
flict over the restoration and retention 
of Tribal homelands, and consequently 
impeded economic development. 
‘‘NCAI strongly encourages Congress 
to end this turmoil by enacting a con-
gressional fix to the Indian Reorganiza-
tion Act which reaffirms the Secretary 
of the Interior’s authority to restore 
Tribal homelands for all federally rec-
ognized Tribal nations.’’ 
Chief Kirk Francis of the Penobscot 
Nation and president of the United 
Southern and Eastern Tribes, USET, 
adds his support, saying, ‘‘Homelands 
are essential to exercising Tribal Gov-
ernment authority, protecting our cul-
tural identity, and foundational to 
growing our economies. After decades 
of Federal efforts to diminish our 
homelands, placing land into trust is a 
critical aspect of the Federal Govern-
ment’s trust and treaty obligations and 
righting these historical wrongs.’’ 
For years elected Tribal Government 
leaders have told Congress repeatedly 
that the Carcieri decision has caused 
significant hardship and has created 
second-class status for Tribal nations 
when it comes to restoring their home-
lands. Tribal governments currently 
experience enormous time and scarce 
resources fighting Carcieri-based law-
suits. 
For example, Chairman Tom Wooten 
of the Samish Indian Nation in Wash-
ington State supports this bill, saying, 
‘‘H.R. 4352 will help right past wrongs 
by the Department of the Interior and 
enable the Samish Indian Nation to 
move forward in reestablishing our 
homeland and rebuilding our commu-
nity. 
‘‘In 2018, the Interior Department ap-
proved the Tribe’s trust land applica-
tion for 6.7 acres after an over 9-year 
process to complete a Carcieri anal-
ysis. The Department’s decision is tied 
up in endless litigation based upon 
Carcieri. 
‘‘This bill would stop frivolous litiga-
tion to ensure that no other Tribe has 
to go through what we went through.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this is why we need 
to take action today, to pass a clean 
Carcieri fix. Since the 2009 opinion, 
Members in both Chambers of Con-
gress, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, have introduced legislation to 
restore the original intent of the In-
dian Reorganization Act. 
This is a completely bipartisan issue. 
In fact, I will say it is a nonpartisan 
issue. This bill restores a fair and equal 
land-into-trust process, which is a fun-
damental 
responsibility 
within 
our 
government-to-government 
relation-
ship with all federally recognized Trib-
al nations. 
Last Congress, the House overwhelm-
ingly supported Representative TOM 
COLE’s legislation to fix this long-
standing issue for Indian Country, 
which I proudly cosponsored. Today, I 
ask my colleagues to join us again in 
passing a clean Carcieri fix. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Tribal 
nations 
should not be discriminated against be-
cause of their date of Federal recogni-
tion. The date has no bearing on their 
existence as sovereign nations, so it 
should have no bearing on their right 
to reestablish their homelands. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding such 
time. 
I rise today in strong opposition to 
the current form of H.R. 4352. 
In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, with 
the intent to restrict casinos to Tribes’ 
original reservations. 
H.R. 4352 reverses a major 2009 Su-
preme Court decision, and the bill 
would lead to future abuses of IGRA. 
The bill gives unelected bureaucrats a 
blank check to take any land anywhere 
in America into trust without respect 
for impacted communities, including 
other Tribes. 
More importantly, H.R. 4352 allows 
reservation shopping and for lands to 
be taken into trust for off-reservation 
casinos in places where States, local 
governments, and other Tribes oppose 
such action. 
H.R. 4352 will result in a flood of new 
off-reservation casinos that cause harm 
to States and local communities. Many 
of these casino locations are nowhere 
near Tribes’ historic reservations and 
will be handpicked by gambling inves-
tors and Washington bureaucrats. 
If H.R. 4352 passes, all Tribes would 
have to do in order to get land taken 
into trust and open off-reservation ca-
sinos is to show that they are federally 
recognized by the Department of the 
Interior. 
b 1300 
The reality is that this bill could be 
fixed. 
Last Congress, in committee, we 
talked about the importance of finding 
common ground on which to address 
community concerns about off-reserva-
tion casino abuse and the valid con-
cerns brought to the committee by 
State and county governments. 
H.R. 4352 should be considered under 
an open rule and amended prior to 
being brought to the floor to address 
these real bipartisan concerns about 
the real-world impacts of the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6734 
December 1, 2021 
Taking land into trust divests the af-
fected State and local governments of 
jurisdiction. When land is taken into 
trust, for example, the Tribe will pay 
no applicable taxes on the land, but the 
county or city in which the land is lo-
cated might nonetheless be required to 
supply the Tribe with county and city 
services, and non-Tribal residents will 
pay for it. 
At least consultation should be a 
minimum. Tribes demand this in re-
verse. 
The bill as currently drafted, there-
fore, 
increases 
the 
power 
of 
an 
unelected bureaucracy to divest non-
consenting State and local govern-
ments of jurisdiction over their land. 
This, by itself, is a great cause of con-
cern. 
Let’s be clear about H.R. 4352. A bill 
of this scope and magnitude deserves 
more careful consideration than is 
being given here today. 
Currently, there are almost 600 rec-
ognized Tribes in the United States. 
About 240 of them have gaming oper-
ations. 
H.R. 4352 removes the dam that pro-
vides some restraint on the number of 
Tribal casinos and would be a dramatic 
departure from the existing Federal 
law that has been in place for almost a 
century. 
Before voting on a bill of this mag-
nitude, I hope Members all understand 
that H.R. 4352 will open the floodgates 
to off-reservation Tribal casinos all 
over the United States. 
If H.R. 4352 passes, all federally rec-
ognized Tribes will be eligible to re-
ceive land in trust and potentially open 
off-reservation casinos. This includes 
any Tribe recognized by the Depart-
ment of the Interior that was ineligible 
to receive land in trust and/or was de-
nied land in trust prior to H.R. 4352. 
According to the National Indian 
Gaming Commission fact sheet, as of 
2016, approximately 329, or 58 percent, 
of the recognized Tribes have no gam-
ing operations. 
There is a responsible way for Con-
gress to address these issues. Just 1 
month ago, the House passed H.R. 4881, 
the Old Pascua Community Land Ac-
quisition Act. The broad bipartisan bill 
was done exactly the way it should 
have been done, with community input, 
broad bipartisan support, and, most 
importantly, congressional oversight. 
But H.R. 4352 ignores all of that and 
more. It lets an unelected bureaucracy 
give whatever land it wants to all rec-
ognized Tribes. Thus, the important 
process that made H.R. 4881 a success 
would be ignored if H.R. 4352 passes. 
Let’s be clear. Passage of H.R. 4352 
will allow for new off-reservation casi-
nos to be opened in your States, in 
your communities, and in your back-
yard, and for land to be ripped away 
from local jurisdictions without re-
course. 
As I have constantly said, good proc-
ess equals good policy equals good poli-
tics. This wasn’t done. 
I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 4352. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Arkansas for 
yielding and being so generous with the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4352. Along with my good 
friend, Representative MCCOLLUM
of 
Minnesota, I am proud to cosponsor 
this legislation. 
The legislation amends the Indian 
Reorganization Act of 1934 and reaf-
firms the right of the Secretary of the 
Interior to place land into trust for fed-
erally recognized Indian Tribes. 
Madam Speaker, as I am sure most 
people in this House know, the history 
and relationship between the United 
States and Indian Tribes isn’t some-
thing to always be proud of. Frankly, 
with the passage of the Dawes Act in 
1887, Tribes all over the country, but 
particularly in my State of Oklahoma, 
were systematically stripped of their 
lands, and individual Tribal members 
were as well. I know this because my 
Tribe was one of the victims. My fam-
ily was one of the losers in the process. 
In 1934, the Federal Government 
wisely saw that it had made a bad mis-
take and intervened with the Indian 
Reorganization Act to protect the re-
maining Indian lands and to allow 
modest additions and reacquisitions of 
that land. 
For 75 years, it worked pretty much 
the way it was supposed to work, 
whether it was a Democratic or a Re-
publican administration. Land was pro-
tected and modestly brought back into 
trust—only 9 million acres so far since 
1934, so it is not as if we have had a 
large transfer of land back. But we 
have protected what was there and 
added back to Tribal patrimony where 
it made sense. 
All that was upset by the Carcieri v. 
Salazar decision in 2009. That was a 
really bad decision, quite frankly. It 
did, as my friends from New Mexico 
and Minnesota both pointed out, upset 
the balance. It created a two-tiered 
system and penalized Tribes that had 
not been federally recognized in 1934. 
That, by the way, wasn’t just ‘‘new 
Tribes.’’ A lot of them—the case was 
based on the Narragansetts in Rhode 
Island—actually had been around for a 
long time. 
The Narragansetts are in the same 
place they always were. They were rec-
ognized by the State of Rhode Island 
but for some reason weren’t in the 1934 
bill. 
So a lot of people have been victim-
ized by this, and frankly, a lot of inter-
ests have tried to exploit it. 
We have had an opportunity on a 
couple of occasions to fix it. Actually, 
this House should be proud. In Decem-
ber 2010, my amendment to an appro-
priations bill, supported by my good 
friend Ms. MCCOLLUM, we got it out of 
the House, but it died in the Senate 
that same December. 
As my friend from Minnesota al-
luded, we passed legislation in the last 
Congress to deal with this issue on an 
overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. 
I would just say, for the record, I 
have introduced legislation on this 
every year since 2009. My friend, Ms. 
MCCOLLUM, has done pretty much the 
same, and we have always cosponsored 
one another’s legislation. So I am very 
proud to be here and support this bill. 
I urge passage of this bill. It is a mat-
ter of justice for the Tribes, but it is 
also a matter of equity and a matter 
of, frankly, legislative convenience. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
my friend’s bill, H.R. 4352, and urge its 
passage. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I truly appreciate Representative 
COLE
bringing 
into 
the 
discussion 
about this bill the fact of how it has 
impacted his own Tribe and their abil-
ity to take land into trust and not be 
subject to these unnecessary, frivolous, 
and time-consuming, as well as expen-
sive, lawsuits that just create confu-
sion out there. 
I think the fact that Mr. COLE has 
worked on this every year since we had 
the Carcieri decision tells you so much 
about how, on both sides of the aisle, in 
the House and Senate, we are looking 
for a fix, and this is indeed the Carcieri 
fix. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further re-
quests for time and would inquire 
whether my colleague has any remain-
ing speakers on their side. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I have no further speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Once again, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. We must remember 
that all we are doing is making sure 
that all Tribes have the same access to 
the existing statutory law that allows 
Tribes to take land into trust. We are 
not changing any of the other laws 
that would apply to that trust process. 
I myself have engaged in numerous 
land into trust transactions when I was 
an attorney, and I can tell you they are 
not easy. You must show that you have 
a connection to the land; what you will 
be doing with the land; how you com-
municated and discussed the issue of 
taking land into trust with the nearby 
communities, with the local govern-
ments, with the State government; is 
this aboriginal land; what will you be 
doing with the land; let’s go through 
the NEPA process. 
It is not an easy process, but now 
every Tribe will be able to have the 
same access to the same statutory 
process when we pass this law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.

AGUA CALIENTE LAND EXCHANGE 
FEE TO TRUST CONFIRMATION 
ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 897) to take cer-
tain lands in California into trust for 
the benefit of the Agua Caliente Band 
of Cahuilla Indians, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 897 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Agua 
Caliente Land Exchange Fee to Trust Con-
firmation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The approximately 2,560 
acres of land owned by the Agua Caliente 
Band of Cahuilla Indians generally depicted 
as ‘‘Lands to be Taken into Trust’’ on the 
map 
entitled 
‘‘Agua 
Caliente 
Band 
of 
Cahuilla Indians Land to be Taken into 
Trust’’ and dated November 17, 2021, is here-
by taken into trust by the United States for 
the benefit of the Agua Caliente Band of 
Cahuilla Indians. 
(b) LANDS PART
OF RESERVATION.—Lands 
taken into trust by this section shall be part 
of the Tribe’s reservation and shall be ad-
ministered in accordance with the laws and 
regulations generally applicable to property 
held in trust by the United States for an In-
dian Tribe. 
(c) GAMING PROHIBITED.—Lands taken into 
trust by this section for the benefit of the 
Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians shall 
not be eligible for gaming under the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et 
seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 897 will take 
approximately 2,560 acres of specified 
lands in California into trust for the 
Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians 
and make these lands part of the Agua 
Caliente Indian Reservation. 
The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla 
Indians is indigenous to the desert and 
canyons of what we now call the 
Coachella Valley. I was just there, 
Madam Speaker, and it is beautiful, 
and the manner in which the Agua 
Caliente Band takes care of the land 
and works with their community is su-
perb. They should be recognized for 
their ability to have that government- 
to-government relationship with their 
neighbors. 
The Agua Caliente Indian Reserva-
tion was established in 1876, with their 
ancestral lands located in the greater 
Palm Springs area. Over the centuries, 
the lands traditionally held by the 
Agua Caliente were divided by parcels 
owned by the Tribe, the Federal Gov-
ernment, and private entities. The di-
vided plots of land led to a checker-
board formation of ownership. 
The Tribe has been involved in land 
transfers with the Federal Government 
to consolidate the traditional land and 
reclaim certain culturally significant 
areas throughout the years. In 1999, the 
Tribe assisted in preserving the cul-
tural resources surrounding the Santa 
Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains Na-
tional Monument and supported legis-
lation for its recognition. 
The national monument legislation 
included a land exchange of remote 
wilderness located within the national 
monument. Although the legislation 
establishing the national monument 
passed, it did not expressly state the 
status of any land transferred to the 
Tribe through the land exchange. 
The lack of explicit language about 
the status of land led to the Bureau of 
Land Management and the Tribe work-
ing for at least 17 years to finalize a 
binding exchange agreement for the 
2,560 acres addressed in this bill. 
This bill improves land management 
by the Tribe and the Bureau of Land 
Management 
by 
consolidating 
the 
checkerboard land ownership around 
the Tribe’s reservation by placing 
these lands into trust. 
Concerns regarding public access to 
trails have been addressed. The Tribe 
has a long history of maintaining pub-
lic trails within the monument bound-
ary. I urge anybody who is in the area 
to go take a hike on the trails. They 
are beautiful. 
The land is within a remote wilder-
ness area and will be managed simi-
larly to how the Bureau of Land Man-
agement oversaw the land. 
In a good faith effort to support the 
conservation efforts of the binding ex-
change agreement, the Tribe included a 
gaming prohibition for the lands in 
H.R. 897. 
I thank Dr. RAUL RUIZ for his spon-
sorship of this bill and his hard work 
getting it to this point. 
Madam Speaker, I urge swift adop-
tion of H.R. 897, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 897, the Agua 
Caliente Land Exchange Fee to Trust 
Confirmation Act, would place approxi-
mately 2,560 acres of land owned by the 
Agua Caliente Tribe within the res-
ervation into trust. 
And I will agree with the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. I have vis-
ited this area, and it is a beautiful 
area. 
The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla 
Indians’ reservation is located approxi-
mately 100 miles southeast of Los An-
geles in and around Palm Springs, Cali-
fornia, with nearly 11,000 acres of the 
reservation within the city limits of 
Palm Springs. 
Originally established in 1876 by 
President Grant, the Tribe’s reserva-
tion 
only 
encompassed 
11⁄2
acres. 
Today, the reservation is approxi-
mately 31,000 acres. 
The lands in question were acquired 
through a land exchange with the Bu-
reau of Land Management in 2018 pur-
suant to the Santa Rosa and San 
Jacinto Mountains National Monument 
Act of 2000. H.R. 897 would allow the 
Bureau of Land Management exchange 
lands owned by the Tribe to be taken 
into trust and made part of the Tribe’s 
reservation. Gaming pursuant to the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act would 
be prohibited. The Tribe intends to use 
the land for conservation purposes. Ac-
cording to the Tribe, the Santa Rosa 
and San Jacinto Mountains hold strong 
cultural and historical value to the 
Tribe. 
I appreciate the work of the Tribe 
and the bill’s sponsor to advance this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 897, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

INDIAN BUFFALO MANAGEMENT 
ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 2074) to assist 
Tribal governments in the manage-
ment of buffalo and buffalo habitat and 
for the reestablishment of buffalo on 
Indian lands, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2074 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Indian Buf-
falo Management Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) buffalo sustained a majority of Indian 
Tribes in North America for many centuries 
before buffalo were nearly exterminated by 
non-Indian hunters in the mid-1800s; 
(2) the historical, cultural, and spiritual 
connection 
between 
buffalo 
and 
Indian 
Tribes has not diminished over time; 
(3) Indian Tribes have long desired the re-
establishment of buffalo throughout Indian 
country for cultural, spiritual, and subsist-
ence purposes; and 
(4) the successful restoration of buffalo 
would allow an Indian Tribe to benefit 
from— 
(A) the reintroduction of buffalo into the 
diets of the members of the Indian Tribe; 
(B) the rekindling of the spiritual and cul-
tural relationship between buffalo and the 
Indian Tribe; and 
(C) the use of buffalo for economic develop-
ment, in the case of an Indian Tribe that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6737 
December 1, 2021 
In the 1840s, the buffalo population in 
North America was estimated at 30 
million, with approximately 60 million 
at its peak. Before colonization, about 
7 million indigenous peoples populated 
the 
North 
American 
continent. 
Throughout this time, many indige-
nous peoples coexisted with buffalo, 
often through a sacred, spiritual rela-
tionship. The buffalo provided food, 
shelter, tools, clothing, and became an 
essential component of traditional be-
liefs and religion. 
But in the 19th century, in an at-
tempt to displace or eradicate indige-
nous peoples, the United States mili-
tary slaughtered tens of millions of 
buffalo. At the turn of the century, 
fewer than 500 buffalo remained in this 
country. Similarly, the American In-
dian population was reduced to merely 
250,000 in the early 1900s. What a loss. 
By the 20th century many buffalo con-
servation efforts were headed by Presi-
dent Teddy Roosevelt and frequently 
led to private ownership of buffalo 
herds. 
In 1991, 10 Tribes committed to buf-
falo restoration efforts with 1,500 buf-
falo and organized the InterTribal Buf-
falo Council, or ITBC. The ITBC col-
laborates with several Federal agencies 
for buffalo management, and now in-
cludes 69 federally recognized Tribes in 
19 States with 55 buffalo herds. I am 
here to report that many of the Tribes 
and pueblos within my district have 
thriving herds of their own. 
The Indian Buffalo Management Act 
will allow Tribal nations to develop 
and maintain buffalo herds on Tribal 
lands to restore treaty obligations and 
the buffalo population itself. Addition-
ally, this bill will enable the transpor-
tation of surplus buffalo from Federal 
lands into Tribal lands. The great 
Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, summed up 
the atrocities surrounding the buffalo 
when he said, ‘‘a cold wind blew on the 
prairie on the day the last buffalo fell. 
A death wind for my people.’’ 
Passage of the Indian Buffalo Man-
agement Act will begin the remedi-
ation of buffalo for indigenous peoples 
and restore religious and spiritual 
practices that were stripped after the 
founding of this country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the swift 
adoption of this bipartisan bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2074, as amended, the Indian Buf-
falo Management Act, and I also thank 
my good friend and the sponsor of the 
legislation, the dean of the House, Con-
gressman DON YOUNG, for his tireless 
advocacy on behalf of Indian Country. 
Madam Speaker, it may come to a lot 
of people’s surprise but in my home 
State of Arkansas, in my district, we 
actually had buffalo herds there at one 
time. And it lingers in many names 
around the State: The Buffalo National 
River, the Buffalo Gap. There is actu-
ally a history of buffalo in Arkansas 
and many other States that no longer 
have herds. 
H.R. 2074 would authorize the Depart-
ment of the Interior to establish a per-
manent program to develop and pro-
mote the capacity of Indian Tribes and 
Tribal organizations to manage buffalo 
and buffalo habitat. 
The American buffalo, or bison, has 
long held importance to the United 
States and was officially named the na-
tional mammal in 2016. Many American 
Indian and Alaska Natives have also 
had a longstanding cultural and spir-
itual relationship with buffalo, which 
continues to this day. 
By the end of the 19th century, how-
ever, buffalo were near extinction. But 
as a result of conservation efforts, buf-
falo have slowly returned, and the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture has esti-
mated that there are now 200,000 buf-
falo in the United States. 
In 1991, several Tribes with buffalo 
herds joined together forming the 
InterTribal Buffalo Council. The coun-
cil received a Federal charter to aid 
Tribes in the restoration of buffalo on 
Tribal lands in 2009. 
Today, the InterTribal Buffalo Coun-
cil is comprised of 68 member Indian 
Tribes and Alaska Natives with 55 buf-
falo herds in 19 States with the mission 
of restoring buffalo to Indian Country. 
In 2019, the council received approxi-
mately $1.4 million from the Bureau of 
Indian 
Affairs. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
available funding is subject to the fluc-
tuating appropriations and it is not 
dedicated to buffalo management on 
Tribal lands. The council estimates 
that unmet needs are in excess of $12 
million per year. 
H.R. 2074 would dedicate $14 million 
annually for the Department of the In-
terior to directly support the ability of 
Indian Tribes to protect, conserve, and 
enhance buffalo populations on their 
lands. The bill would authorize the 
Secretary of the Interior to enter into 
agreements with Indian Tribes or Trib-
al organizations to dispose of surplus 
buffalo on Federal land and transfer 
those buffalo to Indian lands. 
The program is intended to help 
Tribes and Tribal organizations plan, 
conduct, or implement buffalo restora-
tion programs, plan and execute com-
mercial activities related to buffalo 
products, and carry out other activities 
related to buffalo restoration and man-
agement. 
I again thank Congressman YOUNG 
for his leadership on American Indian 
and Alaska Native issues, and I urge 
support for this measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, this is 
sort of a sweetheart time. I have the 
ranking member and I have the chair-
man, 
Chairman 
GRIJALVA, 
and 
of 
course, my chairman—thank you—sup-
porting a bill, I think, that is long 
overdue. 
I think some mentioned the fact that 
the demise of the buffalo was the de-
mise of the American Indian, done de-
liberately. And now we are trying to 
restore it on Indian land. This is a bill 
that gives an opportunity for consump-
tion of food that is good for the Tribe, 
but also economically. 
The buffalo is a magnificent animal. 
We recognized it as a mission when we 
had the Buffalo nickel, and it is recog-
nized in your State and my State. It is 
amazing that at one time—you may 
not realize it—we had tremendous 
herds of buffalo up there, but it wasn’t 
man that diminished them, it was cli-
mate change that actually froze them 
out. 
This is a bill that will give the oppor-
tunity to Tribes to reestablish the buf-
falo on Native lands, that history won’t 
repeat itself, that no one will kill them 
like they did before, and will have a 
sustainable yield of a magnificent ani-
mal. 
Madam Speaker, for those in this au-
dience and this great Chamber who 
haven’t eaten buffalo burgers, you bet-
ter try it. It is one of the better meats. 
I am promoting this right now. I don’t 
have a buffalo, but it is one of the bet-
ter meats. It is good for the Nation. It 
is good for the Tribes. It is good for the 
buffalo. This bill is a good bill. It is a 
bill that should have been, frankly, 
passed a long time ago. 
Madam Speaker, I believe what we 
are doing today is the right thing. I 
want us to recognize this act as an act 
that promoted my American Indian, 
Alaska Natives. We have three Tribes 
in Alaska that have buffalo already, 
and they are anxious for this bill to go 
forward. 
If you haven’t eaten buffalo jerky, 
try it. It is good, too. 
Madam Speaker, I am suggesting re-
spectfully that this is a good piece of 
legislation, bipartisan, working to-
gether for the first Americans, and I 
am proud to be the sponsor of it. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I am so very lucky to have on the 
Subcommittee for indigenous peoples, 
the dean of the House, Representative 
DON YOUNG, as the ranking member. 
The amount of work that we do in that 
committee, that is bipartisan, that al-
ways looks at what is the issue that 
must be solved and works together to 
solve that issue, is exactly sort of epit-
omized by this bill. 
We are recognizing that there was a 
tragedy in our history where we actu-
ally tried to eliminate the food source 
for the indigenous peoples of the Amer-
icas. And we did. We caused hunger. We 
caused the deprivation, but we are rec-
ognizing that today and we are going 
to be giving the assistance to all Tribes 
to be able to manage buffalo herds. 
I have been very fortunate to eat 
bison. We love bison burgers at my

home; and I have been at Taos Pueblo 
when they have offered in their cere-
monial way the buffalo meat and the 
cooking around the fire. It is indeed de-
licious. I completely agree with the 
dean of the House. But we also need to 
recognize that managing a buffalo herd 
is not simple. We need to make sure 
that there are no diseases that are 
passed between cattle or elk and buf-
falo. They need to make sure that 
there is the right genetics so that we 
don’t interbreed so much. 
So it does require a lot of work, and 
this bill provides the Tribes with the 
assistance so that they can both pro-
tect and manage these herds of these 
magnificent animals. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
in closing, I encourage passage of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, for all of the reasons that has 
been stated on the floor of this glorious 
House today, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2074, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3531, the Women Who 
Worked on the Home Front World War 
II Memorial Act, introduced by Rep-
resentative ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. 
And I thank Representative ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON for the work that she 
has done to make sure that all women 
are recognized and that we have a way 
of focusing that recognition through 
this memorial. 
This bill would authorize the estab-
lishment of a memorial to commemo-
rate the nearly 19 million women who 
worked on the home front during World 
War II. With mass male enlistment 
leaving significant vacancies in the in-
dustrial and defense agencies, women 
across the country filled thousands of 
jobs that were historically held by men 
to support the war effort and to keep 
America running. 
As the men fought abroad, these 
women worked in defense plants, flew 
military aircraft, delivered mail, and 
performed countless other duties nec-
essary to keep the home front running. 
b 1330 
In addition to the women working on 
the home front, nearly 350,000 women 
served in uniform, both at home and 
abroad—directly supporting the war ef-
fort as codebreakers, Airforce Service 
Pilots, and as volunteers for organiza-
tions such as the Army Nurse Corps. 
The work carried out by women on 
the home front during World War II 
opened the door for women to hold 
more types of jobs than ever before, 
and it is long past time that Congress 
recognizes the contributions to our Na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleague for introducing 
this important legislation. I would also 
like to extend my gratitude to Ms. 
Raya Kenney, who developed the idea 
for this memorial when she was in fifth 
grade, and for her tireless efforts to en-
sure that the millions of women who 
worked on the home front during World 
War II are recognized and celebrated. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3531, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3531 offered by Del-
egate ELEANOR
HOLMES
NORTON, au-
thorizes the Women Who Worked on 
the Home Front Foundation to estab-
lish a commemorative work in Wash-
ington, D.C., to commemorate the com-
mitment and service of millions of 
women during World War II. 
During World War II, roughly 12 mil-
lion women worked in defense indus-
tries and support services across the 
Nation. Women served in critical pro-
fessional roles in shipyards, steel mills, 
foundries, warehouses, offices, and hos-
pitals. 
Women worked as codebreakers, air-
craft testing pilots, trainers, welders, 
riveters, telegraph operators, radio and 
electrical engineers, crane operators,

surveyors, assembly line workers, and 
many other jobs that kept America 
running. 
In recent years, Congress established 
the Rosie the Riveter National Histor-
ical Park in California to highlight the 
incredible contributions of women to 
the war effort. Authorizing this com-
memorative work in our Nation’s cap-
ital is another fitting tribute to the 
brave, strong, and intelligent women 
that helped us win the war. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON), the 
sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank both of my friends for their kind 
remarks on my bill, the Women Who 
Worked on the Home Front World War 
II Memorial Act. As my friend has just 
said, this is really an unusual bill be-
cause it came to me from a fifth grad-
er. I am particularly pleased and proud 
to speak in favor of her bill, the 
Women Who Worked on the Home 
Front World War II Memorial Act. This 
is all her idea, including getting the 
funds for the memorial. 
This bill would authorize the estab-
lishment of a memorial on Federal 
land in the District of Columbia com-
memorating the efforts of the 18 mil-
lion American women who kept the 
home front running during World War 
II. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Senators 
TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, MARSHA
BLACK-
BURN, and MIKE BRAUN for introducing 
the companion bill in the Senate. Last 
Congress, the House passed this non- 
controversial bill by a voice vote, and I 
am hoping for that result again in this 
House and in the Senate. 
As a teenager, Raya Kenney, the 
founder—and I emphasize ‘‘founder’’ for 
this very young woman—of the non- 
profit Women Who Worked on the 
Home 
Front 
Foundation—her 
own 
foundation—and my constituent, as she 
is, came up with the idea of a memorial 
to honor the women on the home front 
who supported World War II in its ef-
fort. 
She rightfully questioned why the 
women on the home front, whose ef-
forts were so instrumental in main-
taining the stability of our country 
during World War II, have not received 
as much recognition for their contribu-
tions as the men who fought bravely in 
World War II. 
This bill would authorize the Women 
Who Worked on the Home Front Foun-
dation to establish a memorial to 
honor these women. The memorial is 
designed to be interactive and to edu-
cate visitors on the important role 
women played during World War II. 
Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage 
of women in the workforce increased 
from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. 
By 1945, one in four married women 
worked outside the home. The work 
done by women on the home front 
opened the doors for women in the 
workplace widely and has had a pro-
found and lasting effect on the job mar-
ket ever since. 
As a result of their efforts, millions 
of American women on the home front 
redefined so-called women’s work and 
paved the way for future generations. 
Many women also played critical 
roles in support of the war effort. More 
than 10,000 women served behind the 
scenes of World War II as codebreakers. 
Due to the classified nature of their 
work, they did not receive recognition 
for their tireless efforts until recently. 
Women were also trained to fly mili-
tary aircraft so male pilots could leave 
for combat duty overseas. More than 
1,100 female civilian volunteers flew 
nearly every type of military aircraft 
as part of the Women Airforce Service 
Pilots, the WASP program. 
The WASPs flew planes from fac-
tories to bases, transported cargo, and 
participated in simulated strafing and 
target missions. These women were not 
given full military status until 1977, 
and it was not until 2010 that they were 
recognized with the Congressional Gold 
Medal. 
Women have been historically under-
represented in our memorials, particu-
larly the memorials on Federal land in 
our Nation’s capital. It is fitting to au-
thorize a memorial that would allow 
millions of visitors to the Nation’s cap-
ital to understand and honor the heroic 
efforts of these women and their last-
ing impact on the fabric of our society. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I have no further speakers on my side, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
as I listened to the testimony about 
the bill today, I thought about all of 
the women that I was around growing 
up who were part of that war effort at 
home during World War II and the jobs 
that they did that were critical to the 
war effort. 
I 
think 
about 
Representative 
BURCHETT’s mother from Tennessee 
who flew planes in World War II. My 
counsel’s grandmother, Mimi Hart, was 
a codebreaker in World War II, and I 
think it is fitting that we recognize all 
these women as they are getting up in 
years and we are losing a lot of them. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
gentlewoman for bringing this bill for-
ward. I urge adoption, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I am so grateful to Represent-
ative ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON because 
she knows how to listen to brilliant 
women no matter the age. We really 
need to thank Ms. Raya Kenney for 
coming up with the idea. Precisely, as 
we have heard on the floor of the House 
today, it was not just Rosie the riveter, 
it was a complex participation of 
women in the workforce. 
In New Mexico, they were partici-
pating by running the ranches, they 
were participating in our national labs 
on defense issues and some of the most 
complex 
scientific 
discoveries 
that 
helped us win the war. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3531, the ‘‘Women Who 
Worked on the Home Front World War II Me-
morial Act.’’ 
I would first like to thank my colleague, Del-
egate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, for intro-
ducing this important legislation to honor these 
women. 
This bill authorizes the Women 
Who 
Worked on the Home Front Foundation to es-
tablish a commemorative work on federal land 
in the District of Columbia in commemoration 
of the commitment and service represented by 
women who worked on the home front during 
World War II. 
This important legislation would authorize a 
memorial in honor of these women and their 
service to our nation, right here in the Nation’s 
capital. 
During World War II, over 18 million Amer-
ican women kept the home front running in 
support of the country’s overall war effort. 
Not only did they give their sons, husbands, 
fathers, and brothers to the war effort, they 
gave their time, energy, labor, and some even 
gave their lives. 
Beyond providing support for their children 
at home and men at war, the committed 
women on the home front stepped forward to 
assume the work and duties needed to keep 
the country running, most of these jobs were 
not available to women before the war. 
Between 1940 and 1945, the age of ‘‘Rosie 
the Riveter,’’ the percentage of women in the 
U.S. workforce increased from 27 percent to 
nearly 37 percent, and by 1945, nearly one 
out of every four married women worked out-
side the home. 
World War II opened the door for women to 
work in more types of jobs than ever before. 
These women were not only instrumental to 
the war effort, but they showed the country 
and the world what women were capable of, 
fundamentally changing the path for future 
generations of women. 
Eisenhower himself said, ‘‘The contribution 
of the women of America, whether on the farm 
or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was 
a sine qua non [or necessary for] . . . the in-
vasion effort.’’ 
These women were fundamental to our de-
feat of the Axis Powers, and I fully support this 
legislation’s passage to honor their valiant ef-
forts. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 3531, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
BLACKWELL SCHOOL NATIONAL 
HISTORIC SITE ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4706) to establish 
the Blackwell School National Historic 
Site in Marfa, Texas, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4706 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Blackwell 
School National Historic Site Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE.—The term ‘‘na-
tional historic site’’ means the Blackwell 
School, in Marfa, Texas. 
(2) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of the Interior. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) The Blackwell School, located at 501 
South Abbott Street, in Marfa, Presidio 
County, Texas, is associated with the period 
of racial segregation in Marfa public schools 
and is the sole extant property directly asso-
ciated with Hispanic education in the com-
munity, the remaining buildings having been 
torn down after the school closed in 1965. 
(2) The Blackwell School is a tangible re-
minder of a time when the practice of ‘‘sepa-
rate but equal’’ dominated education and so-
cial systems. Despite being categorized as 
‘‘white’’ by Texas law, Mexican Americans 
were regularly excluded from commingling 
with Anglos at barbershops, restaurants, fu-
neral homes, theaters, churches, and schools. 
(3) The spectrum of experiences of students 
and teachers at the Blackwell School con-
stitute an important record of life in a seg-
regated school in the context of the history 
of Texas and America. 
(4) Mexican and Mexican American culture 
and history in Marfa is tied to the Blackwell 
School, which for more than 50 years served 
as a leading feature of the Hispanic commu-
nity, illustrating the challenge of maintain-
ing cultural identity in a dominant Anglo so-
ciety. Yet today, Hispanic influences are 
seen in Marfa’s social and religious organiza-
tions, business and government institutions, 
and shared experiences of language, food, and 
music. 
(5) The historic Blackwell School building 
is a physical record of the longevity and 
beauty of the distinctive design and crafts-
manship informed by both traditional tech-
niques and materials, and the transition 
from purely the vernacular to the period of 
materials, design, and workmanship made 
available after the arrival of the railroad. 
The original historic school building and 
grounds on which it stands provide an au-
thentic setting to commemorate and inter-
pret the history of the Blackwell School. 
(6) The Blackwell School is closely associ-
ated with the broad patterns of local, State, 
and national history in the area of school 
segregation. Mexicans and other members of 
the Latin American diaspora have placed a 
high value upon education as a means of eco-
nomic, social, and political advancement. 
(7) Mexican Americans and other members 
of the Latin American diaspora have placed 
a high value upon education as a means of 
economic, social, and political advancement. 
However, Hispanics and Latinos have not al-
ways had equitable opportunities and access 
to quality educational facilities in the 
United States. 
SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BLACKWELL 
SCHOOL NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), 
there is established the Blackwell School 
National Historic Site in the State of Texas 
as a unit of the National Park System to 
preserve, protect and interpret for the ben-
efit of present and future generations the 
Blackwell School, its role as both an aca-
demic and cultural cornerstone in the com-
munity in Marfa, Texas, and its function 
within a segregated system of education in 
Texas and the United States from 1885 
through 1965. 
(2) CONDITIONS.—The national historic site 
shall not be established until the date on 
which the Secretary has— 
(A) entered into a written agreement with 
the Marfa Unified School District providing 
that the Blackwell School shall be donated 
to or placed by agreement into co-manage-
ment with the United States for inclusion in 
a national historic site to be managed con-
sistently with the purposes of a national his-
toric site; and 
(B) acquired sufficient land or interests in 
land within the boundaries of the national 
historic site to constitute a manageable 
unit. 
(b) BOUNDARIES.—The boundaries of the na-
tional historic site shall be the boundaries 
generally depicted on the map. 
(c) AVAILABILITY OF MAP.—The map shall 
be on file and available for public inspection 
in the appropriate offices of the National 
Park Service. 
(d) ACQUISITION
OF AUTHORITY.—The Sec-
retary may only acquire any land or interest 
in land located within the boundary of the 
national historic site by— 
(1) donation; 
(2) purchase with donated funds; or 
(3) exchange. 
(e) ADMINISTRATION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall ad-
minister this national historic site in ac-
cordance with— 
(A) this Act; and 
(B) the laws generally applicable to units 
of the National Park System. 
(2) MANAGEMENT PLAN.— 
(A) Not later than 3 years after the date on 
which funds are first made available to the 
Secretary for this purpose, the Secretary 
shall prepare a general management plan for 
the national historic site in accordance with 
section 100502 of title 54, United States Code. 
(B) Upon completion, the Secretary shall 
submit the general management plan pre-
pared pursuant to subparagraph (A) to the 
Committee on Natural Resources of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources of the Sen-
ate. 
(f) COOPERATIVE
AGREEMENTS.—The Sec-
retary shall enter into cooperative agree-
ments with the Blackwell School Alliance 
(and other local, regional, State, academic 
and nonprofit partners) for interpretive and 
educational programming, technical assist-
ance, and rehabilitation related to the na-
tional historic site. 
(g) WRITTEN CONSENT OF OWNER.—No pri-
vate property or non-Federal public property 
shall be included within the boundaries of 
the national historic site or managed as part 
of the national historic site without the 
written consent of the owner of such prop-
erty. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4706, the Blackwell School Na-
tional Historic Site Act, introduced by 
my colleague, Representative TONY 
GONZALES of Texas. 
This bill would direct the Secretary 
of 
the 
Interior 
to 
establish 
the 
Blackwell School National Historic 
Site to preserve, protect, and interpret 
the role of the Blackwell School as an 
academic and cultural cornerstone in 
Marfa, Texas. 
The Blackwell School was the sole 
public education institution for Mexi-
can-American children in Marfa from 
1909 until 1965, when Marfa schools 
were integrated. 
The building is a tangible reminder 
of a time in American history when 
separate but equal remained so preva-
lent in our culture. It is a powerful re-
minder of the work that still remains 
before us today. 
Approximately 
4,000 
students 
at-
tended the Blackwell School over the 
course of more than 50 years. Despite 
the inherent unfairness of segregation, 
the Blackwell School became a meet-
ing place and source of pride for the 
local Hispanic community. 
Today, all that remains of the once 
sprawling campus is a three-room 
adobe schoolhouse—one of the last 
such schools remaining in Texas. Des-
ignating the Blackwell School as a na-
tional historic site ensures that the 
story of this school is maintained so 
that future Americans can learn from 
and understand its rich and complex 
history. 
Madam Speaker, I attended a school 
that was likewise, in its history, seg-
regated. Hispanos attended school on 
one side of the town and all others on 
the other side. 
I 
congratulate 
Representative 
GONZALES for championing this bill to 
bring awareness that this is simply 
part of our history and we must recog-
nize it and understand it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to 
support this bill today, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4706, offered by Representative

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6741 
December 1, 2021 
TONY GONZALES of Texas, to establish 
the Blackwell School National Historic 
Site in Marfa, Texas, as a unit of the 
National Park system. 
Segregation 
education 
began 
in 
Marfa in 1892 following the completion 
of a new school for the city’s White 
students. The Blackwell School served 
as the sole public education institution 
for the city of Marfa, Texas’, Mexican 
and Mexican-American children from 
1909 to 1965. 
Known originally as the Ward or 
Mexican School, the Blackwell School 
was later renamed for its longtime 
principal, Jesse Blackwell, who arrived 
in 1922. During Blackwell’s 25-year ten-
ure, the school grew from one building 
and 120 students to a multi-building 
campus and more than 600 students. 
The original historic school building 
and grounds provide an authentic set-
ting to commemorate and interpret the 
history of the Blackwell School. Des-
ignation as a national historic site is 
locally supported and the designation 
helps meet needs identified in the Na-
tional Park Services’ American Latino 
Theme Study completed in 2013. 
Madam Speaker, I highly commend 
my colleague from Texas (Mr. TONY 
GONZALES) for his work on commemo-
rating this important landmark. I urge 
adoption of the measure, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES), the 
author of this bill. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 4706, the Blackwell 
School National Historic Site Act. 
The Blackwell School is located in 
the heart of my district, Marfa, Texas. 
This week we are voting on legislation 
that makes this landmark a national 
historic site under the National Park 
Service. 
b 1345 
When it comes to recognizing lands 
as national historic sites or national 
parks, it is paramount to look outside 
traditional parameters. We must iden-
tify and preserve our history from all 
walks of life and share stories of for-
gotten Americans, including the his-
tory of Mexican Americans and their 
struggle for equality. 
The Blackwell School operated from 
1909 to 1965 as a segregated school for 
children of Mexican descent. While seg-
regation was mandated by law for Afri-
can Americans, it was optional for 
school districts to segregate Mexican 
students. Marfa chose to segregate. 
Children who attended the Blackwell 
School were banned from speaking 
Spanish and even had to bury slips of 
paper with Spanish words in a mock fu-
neral ceremony. 
The school operated during a time of 
American history when separate but 
equal dominated our culture. Segrega-
tion is an ugly stain on America’s leg-
acy, and while we have progressed as a 
country, we must acknowledge the 
painful role segregation played in our 
Nation’s history. 
Establishing the Blackwell School as 
a national historic site ensures that 
the building is maintained properly so 
generations to come can understand its 
rich but complicated history. The im-
pact of establishing this landmark as a 
national historic site goes beyond cul-
tural influence as well. My district is 
home to eight of Texas’ 16 national 
parks such as Big Bend National Park. 
As I traveled through my district, I 
have seen the positive economic and 
societal impacts our national parks 
have on our communities. Establishing 
the Blackwell School as a national 
landmark would bring increased tour-
ism and increased economic activity to 
Presidio County and Marfa. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my friend, FIL VELA, for cospon-
soring this bill; Natural Resources 
Chairman RAU´ L
GRIJALVA; and, of 
course, 
Ranking 
Member 
BRUCE 
WESTERMAN for prioritizing this legis-
lation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, most importantly, I 
would like to thank the Blackwell 
School 
Alliance 
and 
the 
National 
Parks Conservation Association for 
their commitment to giving this land-
mark the recognition it deserves. The 
Blackwell School has been an impor-
tant piece of history for west Texas 
and many Mexican Americans across 
the country, and we are ready to share 
it with the world. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I am ready to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I have no further speakers. I want to 
encourage adoption of this bill and, 
again, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas for his hard work in bringing 
this bill forward. I hope we can all get 
behind it. I urge adoption, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I too want to recognize and 
acknowledge the importance of this 
bill and Representative GONZALES’s 
bringing it to our attention because we 
must remember that all stories—all 
stories—whether they be good or bad, 
whether they concern segregation or 
celebration, are American stories, and 
this bill assists us in looking at the 
complexity of the American story. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in proud support of H.R. 4706, ‘‘The Blackwell 
School National Historic Site Act.’’ 
I would like to thank Congressman TONY 
GONZALES for introducing this bill. 
This bill would establish Blackwell School 
National Historic Site as a unit of the National 
Park System when the Secretary of the Inte-
rior enters into a written agreement with the 
Marfa Unified School District for donation or 
co-management of the site and acquires suffi-
cient lands within the boundaries of the na-
tional historic site to constitute a manageable 
unit. 
The NPS would be required to develop a 
management plan for the site no later than 3 
years after the date on which funds are first 
made available for this purpose. 
The bill also directs the Secretary of the In-
terior to enter into cooperative agreements 
with the Blackwell School Alliance (and other 
partners) for interpretive and educational pro-
gramming, technical assistance, and rehabili-
tation for the site. 
The Blackwell School operated in Marfa, 
Texas, as a segregated school for children of 
Mexican descent from 1909 until Marfa 
schools were integrated in 1965. 
Yet this is much more than just a local 
story. 
The original historic school building, and 
grounds on which it stands, provide an au-
thentic setting to commemorate and interpret a 
time when ‘‘separate but equal’’ dominated our 
culture in ways currently unknown, and essen-
tial to understanding the American experience. 
The Blackwell School Alliance has been 
working 15 years to preserve the stories, leg-
acy, 
and 
buildings 
associated 
with 
the 
Blackwell School. 
We have partnered with many universities, 
state agencies, private foundations, individ-
uals, and the City of Marfa to document and 
promote this important piece of Marfa history. 
This park would not only have an emotional 
impact, but it would also help preserve key 
history for the people of Marfa, Texas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4706. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
COURTHOUSE ETHICS AND 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5720) to amend the Ethics in 
Government Act of 1978 to provide for a 
periodic transaction reporting require-
ment for Federal judicial officers and 
the online publication of financial dis-
closure reports of Federal judicial offi-
cers, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5720, the Court-
house Ethics and Transparency Act of 
2021, embodies an important bipartisan 
effort to address an alarming lack of 
transparency in the personal financial 
holdings of Federal judges and the con-
flicts—or 
appearance 
of 
conflicts— 
those holdings can create in the cases 
those judges are asked to decide. 
This legislation makes incremental 
but necessary progress toward account-
ability by building on Federal statutes 
that already prohibit judges from de-
ciding cases in which they have a per-
sonal financial stake in the outcome. 
It has been the law in this country 
since the 1970s that judges must recuse 
themselves from any case in which 
they hold a legal or equitable interest 
of any size in any property or party 
under consideration. To help ensure 
that recusals occur as required, Fed-
eral law also requires judges to file an-
nual reports disclosing their personal 
financial interests so that litigants, 
the press, and the general public can 
check their work. 
Unfortunately, recent reporting by 
prominent media outlets and a hearing 
by the Courts Subcommitee, have 
shown that the law is not working as 
intended. The infrequency of judges’ fi-
nancial 
disclosures 
and 
the 
inaccessibilty of the reports them-
selves have made actual transparency 
practically impossible. 
The result is recent investigative re-
porting revealing that over 130 Federal 
judges have decided cases in which 
they are part owners of the parties be-
fore them; over 60 judges have actively 
traded shares in the parties in their 
courtrooms while cases are still going 
on, in some cases profiting on those 
trades. 
The consequences of these actions 
are both acute and widespread. Fail-
ures to recuse can cause real harm to 
the parties whose cases are impacted 
and can leave a cloud of doubt over any 
law created from these cases once the 
conflicts are uncovered. Perhaps even 
more concerning, when the public sees 
members of their judiciary behaving in 
such a manner, their faith in their sys-
tem of justice can be withered by cyni-
cism and suspicion. 
H.R. 5720 addresses these problems by 
requiring Federal judges to abide by 
the same periodic transaction report-
ing laws already applicable to Members 
of 
Congress 
and 
senior 
executive 
branch officials. 
Further, the bill requires the Admin-
istrative Office of the United States 
Courts to create an online database of 
judicial financial disclosure reports 
and to timely update that database in 
searchable, sortable, and downloadable 
copies of disclosure reports as they be-
come available so that litigants, the 
press, and the public can access and 
analyze that information in close to 
real time. 
These simple solutions are long over-
due and are the product of bipartisan, 
bicameral collaboration. I want to 
thank Congresswoman ROSS and Con-
gressman ISSA for their leadership on 
this issue and for introducing this leg-
islation. I also appreciate Ranking 
Member JORDAN for working with us on 
this bill, and I want to thank HANK 
JOHNSON, 
chairman 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on the Courts, Intellectual 
Property, and the Internet for holding 
a hearing exposing the issues this bill 
addresses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5720 is a 
thoughtful piece of legislation au-
thored by my colleague, Congress-
woman ROSS. It does something that 
seems like common sense when you 
look at it. Senior members of the exec-
utive branch, not just Cabinet officers 
or sub-Cabinet officers, but all of the 
most highly compensated individuals 
in the executive branch, similarly, the 
highly compensated members of this 
branch and Members of Congress, both 
the House and Senate and the Dele-
gates, all routinely make these filings 
so that if a vote appears to be self-serv-
ing, the public is aware of it. This is 
important when you are looking at 
elective office. 
But it is even more important, 
Madam Speaker, when you are looking 
at people who have a lifetime appoint-
ment, people who do not stand for elec-
tion, and cases that may involve 10s or 
100s of millions of dollars of company 
or individual money and the outcome, 
if later overturned due to the potential 
malpractice, such as the 60 judges who 
actually traded while cases were in 
front of them, the cost can be dev-
astating in dollars. 
But as the chairman so rightfully 
said, the cost can be more devastating 
in public confidence. I want to com-
mend, on a bipartisan and bicameral 
basis, the work that has been done to 
recognize this oversight and, quite 
frankly, push against the members of 
the court who have not yet supported 
this and who somehow believe that 
these are exceptions and that somehow 
those exceptions are not sufficient to 
create a mandate on the third branch 
of government that is the equivalent 
almost identically of the first two. 
It is a small step, and it does not af-
fect a vast amount of judges who rou-
tinely look carefully at this. 
There is one more thing that I think 
needs to be understood that members 
of the committee understand, and that 
is the available databases for these 
judges to appropriately do these tests

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6743 
December 1, 2021 
to find out whether they do have a po-
tential conflict will need to be added. 
So the legislation talks about report-
ing, but we will work diligently with 
the members of all the Federal courts 
to make sure the assets are available 
for them to quickly and routinely 
make these checks—the same as law-
yers have had in the private sector for 
conflicts for many, many years now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman North 
Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Courthouse Ethics 
and Transparency Act. This common-
sense, bipartisan, bicameral legislation 
would serve to fill a transparency void 
that plagues our current Federal judi-
cial system as recently exposed in a 
Wall Street Journal series of reports. 
According to these reports, 131 Fed-
eral judges broke the law by hearing 
cases where they had a financial inter-
est. From 2010 to 2018, these judges 
failed to recuse themselves from 685 
lawsuits involving firms in which they 
or their families held stock, and today 
the number could be much higher. 
b 1400 
This failure has real-world repercus-
sions for the American public and 
American families. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
Jacob 
and 
Jeanetta Springer. They were fore-
closed upon in 2018 after Jeanetta’s ail-
ing father missed one mortgage pay-
ment 3 months before his passing. 
Upon inheriting the property, the 
Springers sought to challenge the fore-
closure in Federal court, believing they 
were behind on fewer payments than 
the bank had claimed. The case was 
dismissed on the recommendation of 
the magistrate judge and again on ap-
peal. But the Springers were soon noti-
fied by the court that their judge had 
purchased the bank’s stock before 
issuing the ruling. 
As a result, their case was reopened 
and assigned to a different judge. In 
frustration, 
Jacob 
Springer 
asked: 
‘‘How was I supposed to know the judge 
owned the stock?’’ 
The 
Springer 
family’s 
experience 
demonstrates the importance of ensur-
ing both justice and the appearance of 
justice in our courtrooms. The impres-
sion of impropriety threatens the trust 
litigants place in judges to be impar-
tial and disinterested arbiters of jus-
tice and the very institutional legit-
imacy of our judiciary. 
The Springer family’s experience was 
not the first time a litigant has had 
their faith in the promise of blind jus-
tice shaken by the lack of trans-
parency in our judiciary. But today, we 
can move toward making it the last by 
passing the Courthouse Ethics and 
Transparency Act. 
This bill will make Federal judges 
more accountable, transparent, and 
ethical, and restore confidence in our 
Federal courts. The legislation will en-
sure Federal judges face the same fi-
nancial transaction disclosure require-
ments as members of the legislative 
and executive branches, eliminating an 
unwarranted transparency gap. 
It also requires the online publica-
tion of judges’ financial disclosures on 
a publicly accessible database. This on-
line database will add another layer of 
protection from potential conflicts. 
Litigants like the Springer family 
would be able to identify conflicts 
sooner instead of solely relying on the 
ineffective recusal processes that cur-
rently are in place. This bill does so 
without compromising the safety of 
Federal judges or their families be-
cause it incorporates existing confiden-
tiality rules that enable judges to re-
dact sensitive information. The data-
base will simply streamline access to 
information already legally required to 
be available to the public. 
I want to thank Judiciary Committee 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
Subcommittee 
Chairman JOHNSON, cosponsor and Sub-
committee Ranking Member ISSA, and 
Representative CHIP ROY for working 
with me to introduce this crucial legis-
lation. We must restore trust in the 
American promise of free and fair ad-
ministration of justice in our court-
rooms. 
For this reason, I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill to increase trans-
parency and accountability in our 
courtrooms. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire 
whether the majority is prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, we have 
additional speakers. I yield 2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Rhode Island 
(Mr. CICILLINE), a member of the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this important leg-
islation that will bring greater trans-
parency to the judges adjudicating 
cases every day all across this country. 
Most high-level government officials 
in all three branches of government, 
including Federal Justices and judges, 
must file annual financial disclosure 
reports. For Members of Congress, as 
well the President, Vice President, and 
other executive branch officials, these 
disclosures are readily available and 
searchable online. This makes the in-
formation easy for the American peo-
ple to obtain, and this tool is vital to 
a transparent government. 
Federal judges and Justices, however, 
do not have to make their disclosures 
readily available to the public online. 
It often takes the public months to re-
quest this information under the cur-
rent disclosure system. 
This delay in information often pre-
vents the public from being able to de-
termine if a judge has a financial inter-
est in a certain court case in a timely 
manner, effectively weakening the en-
forcement of recusal requirements even 
if there is a conflict of interest. 
I am sure many or most judges will-
ingly recuse themselves from cases in 
which they have an interest, but a Wall 
Street 
Journal 
investigation 
found 
that this is not always the case. That 
investigation found that since 2010, 
more than 130 Federal judges have not 
recused themselves in nearly 700 cases 
where they or a family member had a 
financial 
interest, 
an 
unacceptable 
breach of the public’s trust. 
For example, in one case, a judge de-
nied a class action motion against 
Microsoft, which he held stock in, po-
tentially saving the company more 
than $45 million. These kinds of con-
flicts must be transparent. 
The bipartisan Courthouse Ethics 
and Transparency Act of 2021 would in-
crease transparency and empower the 
public by mandating that Federal 
judges’ financial disclosures are pub-
licly available and searchable within 90 
days of filing. This will allow the pub-
lic to access these disclosure forms 
more easily, providing the information 
we need to ensure fair proceedings and 
necessary recusals. 
I thank Congresswoman ROSS for in-
troducing this extremely important 
legislation, and I thank her for her 
leadership. I also want to thank Rep-
resentative JOHNSON and Representa-
tives ROY and ISSA for taking the lead 
on this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON), 
chairman of the subcommittee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5720, which I hope will be only the first 
in a series of reforms from this body to 
assist our courts in maintaining the 
appearance of impartiality, which is so 
essential to the judicial function. 
Perhaps more than any other branch, 
the judiciary relies on the public’s per-
ception of its rectitude, its rejection of 
bias, and its commitment to fairness as 
a necessary predicate to the accom-
plishment of its work. The more the 
public trusts our judges, the more will-
ing the public is to accept their judg-
ments. 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
wrote 
that 
judges do not have armies to enforce. 
They do not have appropriations to en-
courage. They have only their impec-
cable reasoning and their unimpeach-
able objective, which together ensure 
acceptance of their decisions. 
That is why after The Wall Street 
Journal’s investigative reporting re-
vealed widespread failures in the judi-
ciary’s compliance with a straight-
forward conflict of interest statute, my 
Courts, Intellectual Property, and the 
Internet Subcommittee promptly held 
a hearing to examine why those fail-
ures occurred and what we could do to 
help the judiciary avoid making them 
in the future. 
I am pleased that Representative 
ROSS and the ranking member of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6744 
December 1, 2021 
subcommittee, 
Representative 
ISSA, 
immediately advanced a bill designed 
specifically to rectify this systemic 
problem, and I am proud to support it. 
This bill provides the judiciary with 
much-needed tools to ensure not only 
its actual objectivity but the appear-
ance of actual objectivity, both of 
which are critical to ensure the contin-
ued vitality of the judiciary. 
It also welcomes the public, the 
press, and the parties to lawsuits into 
the process for ensuring judicial impar-
tiality by making records of judges’ fi-
nancial interests publicly available and 
freely available. 
This interbranch cooperation, as the 
Constitution intends, is what is needed 
at this time. Congress needs the courts 
because justice is the foundation of our 
democracy. The courts need Congress 
to furnish them with the statutory 
tools necessary to ensure that justice 
satisfies the appearance of justice. 
Our courts and our country will be 
better for the passage of this bill. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Once again, I want to thank the 
chairman, Ms. ROSS, and the others 
who worked so diligently on this legis-
lation. 
In closing, I think the judicial branch 
needs to take notice of the vote here 
today, not because we vote overwhelm-
ingly in support of this legislation, but 
because we stand here today trying to 
vividly separate 130 judges who either 
didn’t know or knew and did not do the 
right thing from 600 or so that sit on 
the bench today, and, over the period 
of this investigation, more than 1,000 
Federal judges who do the right thing, 
who are careful in their personal life 
and in their disclosures, who do recuse 
themselves. 
The confidence in the court belongs 
to the overwhelming majority of judges 
at the district court, at the appellate 
court, at the Federal circuit, and, yes, 
at the Supreme Court, who carefully 
maintain their personal lives, personal 
matters, and their family assets in a 
way that they can be accountable. And 
when in doubt, many of them recuse 
themselves even when it is a judgment 
call. 
So I want to thank the many in our 
third branch of government who do the 
right thing as we bring about this new 
era of transparency that has become 
necessary because of the bad action of 
130 judges. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5720 
would make a meaningful difference in 
the accessibility and transparency of 
an entire branch of our Federal Gov-
ernment. It would strengthen trust in 
our courts and, in doing so, would 
strengthen our courts. 
H.R. 5720 would establish a level 
playing field for access to critical gov-
ernment documents, allowing litigants, 
the public, and the press to enforce and 
ensure accountability. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LIEU). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. NADLER) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
5720, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6753 
December 1, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, one of the important re-
sponsibilities the House gives the Judi-
ciary Committee is to oversee the revi-
sion and codification of the statutes of 
the United States. Keeping track of the 
new laws Congress passes every session 
is a formidable challenge, but it is an 
essential part of maintaining the rule 
of law in our country, and it is a duty 
we take seriously on the committee. 
The body of Federal law is so large 
and complex at this point that it would 
be almost completely unmanageable 
without the United States Code. Cur-
rently consisting of 54 titles, the code 
compiles the general and permanent 
laws of the United States into coherent 
subject areas. 
The code makes our Federal laws ac-
cessible both to the government offi-
cials who work to fairly administer 
them and to the private citizens who 
seek the benefits or relief the law pro-
vides them. 
The code did not appear magically 
out of thin air. Congress created it in 
1926 and, since that time, it has been 
painstakingly constructed and updated 
by expert lawyers working under the 
supervision of the House. 
b 1415 
We all owe a great debt to the Office 
of the Law Revision Counsel, or OLRC, 
whose attorneys ably carry out their 
statutory mandate ‘‘to develop and 
keep current an official and positive 
codification of the laws of the United 
States’’ while maintaining strict im-
partiality as to legislative policy. 
Today, I am pleased to bring to the 
floor six bills developed by the Office of 
the Law Revision Counsel to further 
this mission. The first four bills are 
considered 
editorial 
reclassification 
bills because they make conforming 
changes to statutes that have been im-
pacted by OLRC’s reorganization ef-
forts. 
For example, in 2014, OLRC reorga-
nized the voting and elections statutes 
into a single title, title 52 of the Code. 
The first bill we are considering, H.R. 
5677, updates references to these laws 
in other titles of the Code to reflect 
their new location in title 52. I thank 
Congresswoman MADELEINE
DEAN
for 
introducing this legislation. 
I want to make it very clear that the 
statutory changes made by this bill 
and the others we are considering 
today are purely technical in nature. 
They do not change the meaning or ef-
fect of any existing laws. They are part 
of an ongoing effort to maintain the 
Code as an authoritative, accurate, and 
accessible source of Federal law. 
I would like to thank our colleagues 
who have introduced these bills, and I 
am glad we can fulfill our responsi-
bility to keep the Code updated in a bi-
partisan manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of 
these technical changes. 
Congress’ work requires that we 
maintain an accurate sense of what the 
laws are and how they are portrayed. 
Today’s technical changes, although 
not controversial and completely bi-
partisan, are extremely relevant and 
important. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the immediate 
passage of this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN), the sponsor 
of this bill. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to introduce H.R. 5677, which makes 
technical amendments to the United 
States Code to ensure clarity and ac-
cessibility of our laws. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
duty to oversee the revision and codi-
fication of our laws, making these 
types of bills incredibly important. My 
bill edits titles 2, 50, and 52 of the 
United States Code, the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, War and Na-
tional Defense, and Voting and Elec-
tions, respectively. 
Though it is important to introduce 
new laws in Congress, it is equally im-
portant to look back and ensure exist-
ing laws keep up with our times. That 
is why my bill will ensure there is uni-
formity in our code, making necessary 
technical updates to ensure accuracy. 
The updated code must be main-
tained in a bipartisan manner. These 
discrete changes are important in 
maintaining order in these three im-
portant codes, for example, and order 
and justice in this country under the 
law, allowing for clearer and more ac-
cessible laws for all Americans. 
This seemingly routine process is 
nothing less than urgent and essential. 
We are ensuring our laws are accurate 
and clear. It is required in the pursuit 
of justice. 
I thank our committee for the work 
in maintaining our laws, and I espe-
cially thank the Office of the Law Re-
vision Counsel for their work. I ask ev-
eryone to vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
In closing, there is a great deal of 
thank you required today for the little- 
known Office of the Law Revision 
Counsel for their hard work. This is te-
dious to look through changes and 
their effects and to find the appro-
priate language. 
Additionally, I want to thank the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for 
working with that office to bring this 
legislation to our attention and to the 
floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Congresswoman DEAN
for her 
leadership in introducing this legisla-
tion. I urge everyone to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5677. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6755 
December 1, 2021 
have been impacted by OLRC’s edi-
torial reclassification of titles 7, 20, 
and 43 of the United States Code. 
As I described previously, the statu-
tory changes made by this bill are 
purely technical in nature and they do 
not change the meaning or effect of 
any existing laws. 
I thank the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES) for introducing this 
legislation, I urge all Members to sup-
port it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this is a tech-
nical correction bill, but it is well- 
needed. The minority has not only no 
objection, but we fully support its pas-
sage. 
I have no further speakers, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, as impor-
tant as this legislation is, my brief re-
marks were enough to explain the bill 
for the record. 
Therefore, with the time remaining, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
thank Perry Apelbaum for more than 
30 years of tireless service to the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Judi-
ciary Committee is entrusted with a 
wide and diverse set of issues, ranging 
from constitutional law and the Fed-
eral criminal code to immigration and 
intellectual property. 
In his three decades with the com-
mittee, as a trusted counsel and staff 
director, Perry has left his mark on 
nearly every area of law within that 
broad jurisdiction: protecting the right 
to vote, securing our basic civil lib-
erties, and holding the powerful to ac-
count where necessary. 
All of official Washington knows 
Perry as a brilliant attorney, a selfless 
friend, and a voice of calm in a crisis. 
He earned that reputation leading the 
country through some of the toughest 
moments in our recent history. 
He has worked as senior staff on 
three impeachments. He coauthored 
three books with his longtime boss, 
Chairman John Conyers, Jr.: ‘‘What 
Went Wrong in Ohio,’’ ‘‘The Constitu-
tion in Crisis,’’ and ‘‘Reining in the Im-
perial Presidency.’’ 
After the attacks of September 11, 
2001, Perry worked across the aisle to 
keep us safe in a manner that would be 
consistent with our civil liberties. 
After the attacks of January 6, 2021, 
he spent many sleepless nights ensur-
ing that our democratic institutions 
would endure. 
What strikes me, Mr. Speaker, is 
that Perry’s most important and last-
ing contributions to the committee 
have gone to secure a better life for the 
Americans who need our help most. 
These accomplishments include the In-
nocence Protection Act, the Matthew 
Shepherd-James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act, the Emmett Till Un-
solved Civil Rights Crime Act, the Sec-
ond Chance Act, the Lilly Ledbetter 
Fair Pay Act, the Helping Families 
Save Their Homes Act, and the James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation 
Act. 
All told, these accomplishments have 
benefited countless citizens. They have 
made our social contract more just and 
our justice system more fair. Mr. 
Speaker, the Talmud teaches us that 
whosoever saves one life has saved an 
entire world. By this measure, worlds 
upon worlds owe a debt of gratitude to 
Perry Apelbaum. 
Perry is, of course, far from finished 
in his work for the American people. 
He has told us repeatedly that he in-
tends ‘‘to run all the way through the 
tape’’ on his last days on Capitol Hill. 
He leaves us with a clear sense of 
mission. He has laid the groundwork 
for our most important prerogatives, 
including but not limited to com-
prehensive police reform, commonsense 
checks on the scourge of gun violence, 
and the reauthorization of the Voting 
Rights Act. 
Perry will continue his public service 
in the Department of Justice as a sen-
ior counsel in the Antitrust Division. 
He has already proven himself a com-
mitted advocate for American con-
sumers. His sense of fairness in matters 
of antitrust law is unwavering, and our 
loss will be the Department’s gain. 
Of course, we owe our thanks to Per-
ry’s beloved wife, Laura Apelbaum, and 
his two children, Benjamin and Sarah. 
There is no question that they have 
sustained Perry, in good times and bad, 
through these many years. 
But most of all, Mr. Speaker, we owe 
our thanks to Perry Apelbaum. His de-
parture marks the end of an era on 
Capitol Hill. Our parting is bittersweet, 
but we are so grateful for his leader-
ship, and we wish Perry nothing but 
the best as he takes on this new chal-
lenge on behalf of the American people. 
Please join me in thanking Perry for 
his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5679. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H.R.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I explained during 
consideration of H.R. 5677, this bill has

have been impacted by OLRC’s edi-
torial reclassification of title 25 of the

As I described previously, the statu-
tory changes made by this bill are 
purely technical in nature, and they do 
not change the meaning or effect of 
any existing laws. 
I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ISSA) for introducing this

clude extraneous material on H.R. 5705. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I explained during 
consideration of H.R. 5677, this bill has 
been prepared by the Office of the Law 
Revision Counsel and makes a number 
of conforming changes to statutes that 
have been impacted by OLRC’s edi-
torial reclassification of title 34 of the 
United States Code. 
As I described previously, the statu-
tory changes made by this bill are 
purely technical in nature, and they do 
not change the meaning or effect of 
any existing laws. 
I thank the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BENTZ) for introducing this legis-
lation. I urge all Members to support 
it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, once again, 
the minority has not only no objec-
tions, but we support this important 
legislation, thank the office for bring-
ing it to our attention, and move its 
immediate passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
BENTZ) for his leadership in intro-
ducing this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5705. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

MAKING REVISIONS IN TITLE 5, 
UNITED STATES CODE AND MAK-
ING 
TECHNICAL 
AMENDMENTS 
TO 
IMPROVE 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES CODE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5961) to make revisions in title 5, 
United States Code, as necessary to 
keep the title current, and to make 
technical amendments to improve the 
United States Code. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5961 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
The table of contents for this Act is as fol-
lows: 
Sec. 1. Table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Purposes; 
restatement 
does 
not 
change meaning or effect of ex-
isting law. 
Sec. 3. Revision of title 5, United States 
Code. 
Sec. 4. Technical amendments. 
Sec. 5. Transitional and savings provisions. 
Sec. 6. Effect of references to title 5 on ap-
plication of ethics provisions. 
Sec. 7. Repeals. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSES; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT 
CHANGE MEANING OR EFFECT OF 
EXISTING LAW. 
(a) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to make revisions in title 5, United 
States Code, as necessary to keep the title 
current; and 
(2) to make technical amendments to im-
prove the United States Code. 
(b) RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEAN-
ING OR EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The restatement of exist-
ing law enacted by this Act does not change 
the meaning or effect of the existing law. 
The restatement incorporates in title 5, 
United States Code, various provisions that 
were enacted separately over a period of 
years, reorganizing them, conforming style 
and terminology, modernizing obsolete lan-
guage, and correcting drafting errors. These 
changes serve to remove ambiguities, con-
tradictions, and other imperfections, but 
they do not change the meaning or effect of 
the existing law or impair the precedential 
value of earlier judicial decisions or other in-
terpretations. 
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
(A) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
the 
plain meaning rule or other rules of statu-
tory construction, a change in wording made 
in the restatement of existing law enacted 
by this Act serves to clarify the existing law 
as indicated in paragraph (1), but not to 
change the meaning or effect of the existing 
law. 
(B) REVISION NOTES.—Subparagraph (A) ap-
plies whether or not a change in wording is 
explained by a revision note appearing in a 
congressional report accompanying this Act. 
If such a revision note does appear, a court 
shall consider the revision note in inter-
preting the change. 
SEC. 3. REVISION OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES 
CODE. 
(a) ENACTMENT OF CHAPTER 10.—Part I of

of Representatives shall make a continuing 
review of the activities of each advisory 
committee under its jurisdiction to deter-
mine whether such advisory committee 
should be abolished or merged with any 
other advisory committee, whether the re-
sponsibilities of such advisory committee 
should be revised, and whether such advisory 
committee performs a necessary function 
not already being performed. Each such 
standing committee shall take appropriate 
action to obtain the enactment of legislation 
necessary to carry out the purpose of this 
subsection. 
‘‘(b) CONSIDERATION

thorizing the establishment of any advisory 
committee, each standing committee of the 
Senate and of the House of Representatives

resentatives, as the case may be, whether

mittee are being or could be performed by 
one or more agencies or by an advisory com-
mittee already in existence, or by enlarging 
the mandate of an existing advisory com-
mittee. Any such legislation shall— 
‘‘(1) contain a clearly defined purpose for 
the advisory committee;

sory committee to be fairly balanced in

the advisory committee will not be inappro-
priately influenced by the appointing au-
thority or by any special interest, but will 
instead be the result of the advisory commit-
tee’s independent judgment; 
‘‘(4) contain provisions dealing with au-
thorization of appropriations, the date for 
submission of reports (if any), the duration 
of the advisory committee, and the publica-
tion of reports and other materials, to the

mines the provisions of section 1009 of this 
chapter to be inadequate; and 
‘‘(5) contain provisions which will assure 
that the advisory committee will have ade-
quate staff (either supplied by an agency or 
employed by it), will be provided adequate 
quarters, and will have funds available to 
meet its other necessary expenses.

tent they are applicable, the guidelines set 
out in subsection (b) shall be followed by the

trator shall conduct a comprehensive review 
of the activities and responsibilities of each 
advisory committee to determine—

out its purpose; 
‘‘(B) whether, consistent with the provi-
sions of applicable statutes, the responsibil-
ities assigned to the committee should be re-
vised;

merged with other advisory committees; or 
‘‘(D) whether the committee should be 
abolished.

istrator may from time to time request such 
information as the Administrator deems nec-
essary to carry out functions under this sub-
section. Agency heads shall cooperate with 
the Administrator in making the reviews re-
quired by this subsection. 
‘‘(3) RECOMMENDATIONS.—Upon completion 
of the review, the Administrator shall make 
recommendations to the President and to ei-
ther the agency head or Congress with re-
spect to action the Administrator believes 
should be taken. 
‘‘(c) ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES AND MAN-
AGEMENT
CONTROLS.—The 
Administrator 
shall prescribe administrative guidelines and 
management controls applicable to advisory 
committees, and, to the maximum extent 
feasible, provide advice, assistance, and guid-
ance to advisory committees to improve 
their performance. In carrying out functions 
under this subsection, the Administrator 
shall consider the recommendations of each 
agency head with respect to means of im-
proving the performance of advisory com-
mittees whose duties are related to the agen-
cy.

study and consultation with the Director of 
the Office of Personnel Management, shall 
establish guidelines with respect to uniform 
fair rates of pay for comparable services of 
members, staffs, and consultants of advisory 
committees in a manner that gives appro-
priate recognition to the responsibilities and 
qualifications required and other relevant 
factors. The guidelines shall provide that—

method used in determining such assessed 
value shall be included in the report.

ney, notwithstanding the provisions of para-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5961. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to date, 27 of the U.S. 
Code’s 54 titles have been enacted into 
positive law, which means that the 
text of these titles is itself the law, 
while the remaining titles are nonposi-
tive, meaning that they organize Fed-
eral statutes for users’ convenience but 
do not themselves have the force of 
law. 
This legislation and the next bill we 
will consider represent recent efforts 
by the Office of the Law Revision 
Counsel to keep positive-law titles in 
the Code up to date. Because positive- 
law titles are the law itself, they must 
be amended by law when Congress 
passes new statutes that belong within 
the titles because of their subject mat-
ter. 
H.R. 5961 would make revisions to 
title 5 of the Code, which relates to 
government organization and employ-
ees, to account for three important

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

December 1, 2021 
government accountability laws that 
were adopted in the 1970s: The Federal 
Advisory Committee Act, the Inspector 
General Act, and the Ethics in Govern-
ment Act. 
Since these laws were adopted after 
title 5 became positive law, OLRC had 
placed them in an appendix to title 5, 
which made citation to them awkward 
and confusing. H.R. 5961 eliminates this 
appendix by creating three new chap-
ters for these three laws within the 
body of title 5 itself. 
Like the other codification bills we 
have considered, the statutory changes 
made by this bill are purely technical 
in nature, and they do not change the 
meaning or effect of any existing laws. 
I thank the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. NEGUSE) for introducing this legis-
lation. I urge all Members to support 
it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, in support of 
H.R. 5961, I might take special note 
that since it affects the Inspector Gen-
eral Act, an act that deserves to be 
clearly understood and clearly delin-
eated, because nothing could be more 
important for our government on a 
daily basis than the transparency and 
accountability created by the hard-
working members of the inspectors 
general’s offices. Throughout govern-
ment, they represent the watchdogs, 
the real daily watchdogs of govern-
ment, so I appreciate this technical 
correction and hopefully a little shout- 
out to people who work unsung, some-
times unappreciated, but clearly need-
ed to maintain the kind of account-
ability that Congress demands of the 
executive branch. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. NEGUSE) for his leadership in in-
troducing this legislation. I urge every-
one to support it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5961. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

MAKING REVISIONS IN TITLE 51, 
UNITED STATES CODE AND MAK-
ING 
TECHNICAL 
AMENDMENTS 
TO 
IMPROVE 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES CODE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5982) to make revisions in title 51, 
United States Code, as necessary to 
keep the title current, and to make 
technical amendments to improve the 
United States Code. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5982 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
The table of contents for this Act is as fol-
lows: 
Sec. 1. Table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Purposes; 
restatement 
does 
not 
change meaning or effect of ex-
isting law. 
Sec. 3. Revision of title 51, United States 
Code. 
Sec. 4. Technical amendments. 
Sec. 5. Transitional and savings provisions. 
Sec. 6. Repeals. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSES; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT 
CHANGE MEANING OR EFFECT OF 
EXISTING LAW. 
(a) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to make revisions in title 51, United 
States Code, as necessary to keep the title 
current; and 
(2) to make technical amendments to im-
prove the United States Code. 
(b) RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEAN-
ING OR EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The restatement of exist-
ing law enacted by this Act does not change 
the meaning or effect of the existing law. 
The restatement incorporates in title 51, 
United States Code, various provisions that 
were enacted separately over a period of 
years, reorganizing them, conforming style 
and terminology, modernizing obsolete lan-
guage, and correcting drafting errors. These 
changes serve to remove ambiguities, con-
tradictions, and other imperfections, but 
they do not change the meaning or effect of 
the existing law or impair the precedential 
value of earlier judicial decisions or other in-
terpretations. 
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
(A) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
the 
plain meaning rule or other rules of statu-
tory construction, a change in wording made 
in the restatement of existing law enacted 
by this Act serves to clarify the existing law 
as indicated in paragraph (1), but not to 
change the meaning or effect of the existing 
law. 
(B) REVISION NOTES.—Subparagraph (A) ap-
plies whether or not a change in wording is 
explained by a revision note appearing in a 
congressional report accompanying this Act. 
If such a revision note does appear, a court 
shall consider the revision note in inter-
preting the change.

CODE.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6833 
December 1, 2021 
Æ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5982. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I explained during 
consideration of H.R. 5961, this bill is 
part of the Office of Law Revision 
Counsel’s ongoing effort to keep posi-
tive-law titles of the U.S. Code up to 
date. 
H.R. 5982 would make revisions in 
title 51 of the Code, which covers na-
tional and commercial space programs. 
Since it was created as a positive-law 
title in 2010, Congress has adopted sev-
eral important reforms to the subject 
matter of title 51. Some of these new 
laws were placed into the nonpositive 
title 42, covering public health and wel-
fare, while OLRC located others in 
notes to title 51. H.R. 5982 incorporates 
these recent statutes into the body of 
title 51 itself. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH) for intro-
ducing this legislation. I urge all Mem-
bers to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, as this sec-
tion 
for 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
comes to a close, I want to thank the 
chairman for his hard work and cooper-
ative nature as we went through each 
and every one of these pieces of legisla-
tion, first at the committee and now in 
the full House. 
Often members of the public see 
Members of Congress not getting along, 
not getting things done, and sometimes 
the most tedious work is that which we 
do in the most congenial and noncom-
bative manner. This is a good example 
of it. Hopefully the public will take 
note that Members of Congress can and 
do work together to do the American 
people’s work. 
Again, I want to thank the chairman 
for his diligent work. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge support for this piece of legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman from Minnesota 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH) for her leadership in 
introducing this legislation. I also ap-
preciate the comments of the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) on 
bipartisanship. 
In this era, when the press portrays 
us 
as 
constantly 
at 
each 
other’s 
throats, when the public gets the im-
pression that we never work together, 
that Congress is totally broken, the 
fact of the matter is, we often work to-
gether and we often pass bipartisan 
legislation. It doesn’t get the publicity. 
It is not as exciting as when we fight 
amongst ourselves. The press doesn’t 
report it, but it is vital to the success 
of the United States. 
I congratulate all involved with this 
legislation, and in particular Mr. ISSA 
and the others on the Judiciary Com-
mittee who have worked so hard on 
these bills. I urge everyone to support 
them, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5982. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
UNDERSTANDING CYBERSECURITY 
OF MOBILE NETWORKS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2685) to direct the Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce for Commu-
nications and Information to submit to 
Congress a report examining the cyber-
security of mobile service networks, 
and for other purposes, as amended, on 
which the yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, as amended. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 404, nays 19, 
not voting 10, as follows:

RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-
tion as a member of the Committee on 
the Budget: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, November 30, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I write to respect-
fully tender my resignation as a member of 
the House Committee on the Budget. It has 
been an honor to serve in this capacity. 
Sincerely, 
CAROL D. MILLER, 
Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the resignation is accepted. 
There was no objection. 
ELECTING A MEMBER TO CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, by direction of the Repub-
lican Conference, I offer a privileged 
resolution and ask for its immediate 
consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 826 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET: Mr. Carey. 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECH-
NOLOGY: Mr. Carey. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

HONORING SEAN HUGHES 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, 2 weeks 
ago, Lower Merion, Pennsylvania, and 
the entire Montgomery County com-
munity lost a distinguished educator 
and community leader, Lower Merion 
High School Principal Sean Hughes. 
Coming from Harleysville, Principal 
Hughes dedicated himself to Mont-
gomery County throughout his life, 
serving as a teacher and athletic direc-
tor, and last serving as principal for 14 
years. 
As a teacher, Mr. Hughes taught with 
compassion, personality, and an open- 
door policy, shaping thousands of stu-
dents’ lives with his kindness and lead-
ership. One student called him ‘‘the 
light of the school.’’ 
His trademark phrase was: ‘‘Char-
acter counts.’’ If the outpouring of love 
and support from the Lower Merion 
community, from students past and 
present, is any indication, Mr. Hughes’ 
character was one to emulate. 
His life was taken too soon. May his 
memory and light continue in the 
hearts and minds of his students, peers, 
and family. 
Though it is profoundly difficult, I 
pray for his family, especially his wife, 
Kristi, and their children, Jack, Nolan, 
and Kate, and the Lower Merion High 
School to find solace in the thousands 
of lives he has touched. 
Rest in peace, Principal Hughes. 
Your character has counted and will 
continue to. May your memory be a 
blessing.

HAPPY 30TH BIRTHDAY TO CHINO 
HILLS 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to join the Chino 
Hills community of the 39th District in 
California in celebrating its 30th birth-
day and honoring its rich history, nat-
ural beauty, and wonderful people. 
From Chino Hills State Park to ex-
cellent schools and a vibrant small 
business community, Chino Hills is a 
great place to live and visit. 
We honor our community’s past; we 
recognize the more than 82,000 resi-
dents contributing to our history, cul-
ture, and economy each day; and we 
commit to working together to ensure 
Chino Hills continues to prosper for fu-
ture generations. 
I am honored to represent Chino Hills 
in Congress and will do all I can to en-
sure 
our 
community 
continues 
to 
thrive for many generations to come. 
Happy birthday, Chino Hills.

SENATE SHOULD MOVE SWIFTLY 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Build Back Better Act. 
This bill increases access to afford-
able healthcare by expanding Medicaid 
in States like Georgia and signifi-
cantly reducing the cost of health in-
surance premiums on the exchange. 
With this bill, we will finally ensure 
that every Georgian has access to qual-
ity, affordable healthcare. 
This bill will also ensure that nearly 
200,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds in 
Georgia will have access to universal 
pre-K. 
The Build Back Better Act is the 
largest effort to combat the climate 
crisis in American history and realigns 
our tax code to support economic 
growth in our clean energy economy. 
These are just some of the highlights 
in this critical bill that is fully paid for 
and makes long-overdue investments in 
our community and in our country. 
I urge the Senate to act swiftly to 
pass the Build Back Better Act and in-
vest in the future of all Americans. 
f 
INFLATION IS TAXATION 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I stand 
here representing families all across 
this country who are struggling with 
rising costs of virtually everything, 
from gas to groceries. And there 
doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. 
Inflation is taxation, and it has in-
creased every single month since Joe 
Biden has been President. Last month 
marked a 30-year record high in infla-
tion. 
Even worse, real wages have de-
creased under Biden almost every 
month since he has been in office. 
So what is causing this inflation? 
President Biden and his allies in Con-
gress are continuing to borrow trillions 
and trillions of dollars to pay for a 
massive Big Government expansion. It

is unsustainable, and we cannot afford 
it. 
It is past time we get this runaway 
spending under control. As I have said 
countless times, Washington has a 
spending problem, not a revenue prob-
lem. 
The American people deserve better 
than this. It is time that we put them 
first and get our economy back on 
track. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING BUILD BACK 
BETTER 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight how the Build Back 
Better Act will improve the lives of 
people all across our country. 
For far too long, pharmaceutical gi-
ants have charged outrageous prices 
for lifesaving medication. The Build 
Back Better Act will finally allow 
Medicare to negotiate prices and cap 
the price of insulin at $35 a month. 
For years, hardworking people who 
fell ill or cared for an aging loved one 
were forced to choose between their 
livelihood and their health or that of 
their loved ones. Finally, the Build 
Back Better Act will ensure more peo-
ple have decent healthcare and that 
their coverage is more affordable. 
Importantly, all of this will be paid 
for without raising taxes on middle- 
class families because when billion-
aires pay their fair share, we can invest 
in those who make and build what 
makes and builds America. 
f 
HONORING PASTOR KENNY GRANT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with gratitude to 
honor the service and ministry of Pas-
tor Kenny Grant at Calvary Baptist 
Temple in Savannah, Georgia. 
It is not often in life that you meet 
someone with as complete an under-
standing and unwavering trust in God’s 
plan as Kenny Grant. 
Kenny has served as senior pastor at 
Calvary Baptist Church for 10 years, 
and this past Sunday, he delivered his 
final sermon. 
Kenny dedicated his life to serving 
others at 17 when he joined the U.S. 
Marine Corps. It was during this time 
in the Marine Corps that he came to 
Christ and discovered his calling to 
preach and minister to others. 
After 9 years in the Marines, Kenny 
went straight into the ministry by 
founding his own church. Kenny took 
his experience from his time in the Ma-
rines and used it in his ministry, grow-
ing his church and nourishing the 
hearts of his brothers and sisters in 
Christ. 
Kenny has served the members of 
Calvary Baptist Temple selflessly, and 
we are excited to see where God takes 
him next.

PROTECTING ACCESS TO

(Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, Maya Angelou said that when 
people show you who they are, believe 
them the first time. Mississippi showed 
us. 
The State made its intent clear 
today before the Supreme Court to 
overturn Roe v. Wade, despite 50 years 
of constitutional precedent that clear-
ly upholds it. This is about politicians 
controlling people’s bodies and deci-
sions. 
In my 10 years working for Planned 
Parenthood in the South, I saw exactly 
who is hurt the most by harmful abor-
tion bans: Black, indigenous, and peo-
ple of color, LGBTQI-plus commu-
nities, people struggling to make ends 
meet. Without Roe, the threat to abor-
tion is real and far-reaching. Half of 
U.S. States are poised to ban abortion 
entirely, including my home State of 
Georgia. 
Abortion is essential. We must en-
sure that everyone, no matter their 
ZIP Code has the freedom to make de-
cisions about their health and their 
families. 
In the House, we did our part by pass-
ing the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. It is time for the Senate to do its 
job so that we can rightfully keep abor-
tion safe, legal, and accessible.

DEFEND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE 
(Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to defend the sanctity of 
life. 
Today, the Supreme Court is hearing 
the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization. I am glad the Su-
preme Court has decided to take up 
this important case in which they will 
consider whether all pre-viability bans 
on abortion are unconstitutional. Sci-
entific advancements have rendered 
the viability standard established since 
Roe as outdated. 
Today, we know the following: By 15 
weeks, babies in the womb have a 
heartbeat. They have arms, legs, fin-
gers, and toes. And they have fully de-
veloped hearts and can respond to light 
and touch almost anywhere else on 
their bodies. 
President Biden and my colleagues 
on the left have taken an anti-life 
stance and pushed policies that would 
require taxpayers to fund abortions. 
They also would require healthcare 
providers to perform abortions, despite 
any moral objections that they may 
have, and remove existing protections 
to allow abortions on demand, no mat-
ter what the age of the fetus. 
This is wrong. I value unborn inno-
cent lives and I will always push back 
with a clear and strong message. 
f 
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, for almost 50 years, 
the law has recognized that the deci-
sion of whether to have or not have an 
abortion is protected by the Constitu-
tion. Yet, in the last decade, State law-
makers have pushed through nearly 500 
restrictive laws that make abortion 
difficult and sometimes impossible to 
access. This fight has reached a break-
ing point. 
The Mississippi law being challenged 
at the Supreme Court today would ban 
abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, 
well before viability. Anti-abortion 
policies are about power and control, 
control over our bodies and control 
over our families. We won’t stand for 
it. We will defend our rights and free-
dom to access safe and legal abortion. 
Keep your bans off our bodies. Keep 
out of our doctors’ offices and family 
decisions. 
Keep 
our 
constitutional 
rights in place. 
f 
GOOD FORESTRY FOR THE 
HOLIDAY SEASON 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to announce tonight the 
lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree 
on the west steps in just a few minutes. 
The tree each year is selected from a 
different national forest around the 
country. This year the tree comes from 
the Six Rivers National Forest in 
Northwest California, a four-county 
area I share with Mr. HUFFMAN from 
the Second District. 
The marking of the lighting tonight 
indeed kicks off the Christmas season 
here in Washington, D.C., here at the 
United States Capitol. 
Forestry, of course, is a very impor-
tant part of our life in northern Cali-
fornia and in the West, and positive 
forestry practices are extremely impor-
tant if we are ever going to control 
wildfire and not harm the habitat and 
economies of our areas there. 
I hope we can see in the lighting of 
the Capitol Christmas tree all the good 
things that come with good forestry 
and the holiday season. 
Merry Christmas.

H6839 
December 1, 2021 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
NORTON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Democrats in the House have much to 
be proud of as we approach the end of 
the year. 
In the midst of an unprecedented 
pandemic, we have passed two of the 
most significant bills in the history of 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives—the 
Transportation and Infrastructure bill 
and President Biden’s Build Back Bet-
ter bill. 
I chaired the Highways and Transit 
Subcommittee and I was pleased to at-
tend President Biden’s signing of the 
bill at the White House. The bill di-
rects $39 billion to public transpor-
tation—like 
D.C.’s 
Metro—expands 
broadband, and funds replacing lead 
service pipes. 
Our Build Back Better bill is an om-
nibus bill that catches up with years of 
needs Congress has failed to meet, from 
affordable childcare that will free 
women and men to work, to combating 
climate change, a clear and present 
danger to the planet. 
It would be difficult to find more sig-
nificant bills passed by the House of 
Representatives in a single session. 
f 
RIGHT TO LIFE 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the first unalienable right named in 
the Declaration of Independence is the 
right to life. The Preamble of the Con-
stitution further built the framework 
for this most fundamental liberty. 
‘‘We, the people . . . in order to form 
a more perfect Union, establish justice, 
insure domestic tranquility, provide 
for the common defense, promote the 
general welfare, and secure the bless-
ings of liberty to ourselves and our pos-
terity’’—none of which can truly be ac-
complished when the law allows the 
murder of unborn children. 
The Supreme Court got this wrong in 
1973 and now has the chance to correct 
its mistakes and uphold the constitu-
tional right to life. It is absurd to 
argue, as the plaintiff in Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health Organization does, 
that our founding document can be 
used to prevent duly-elected State leg-
islators from protecting life. 
The Supreme Court must right this 
wrong. Our Nation should never put an 
unwritten right to privacy before the 
enumerated right to life. 
f 
RECOVERING, REBUILDING, 
RESTORING HOPE 
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, tonight, I am honored to 
stand before you to speak on the pas-
sage 
of 
one 
of 
the 
most 
trans-
formational pieces of legislation in a 
generation signed into law, the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. 
In my State of Delaware, this bill 
will invest $1.2 billion for highway re-
pair, over $200 million for bridge repair, 
and over $100 million to expand inter-
net access, and $300 million to expand 
access to clean drinking water. But it 
is more than just concrete and fiber- 
optic cables, it is about the faces and 
places that will benefit from this bill. 
In my State, I think of the students, 
I think of the farmers, I think of the 
union workers whose lives will be im-
proved and whose communities will 
forever change. It is about recovering, 
rebuilding, and restoring hope. 
Madam Speaker, we have more work 
to do, but make no mistake—with the 
bipartisan infrastructure law—we are 
now on the road to recovery and on the 
road to building back better.

AN UNBORN CHILD IS A HUMAN 
LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 4, 2021, 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, 
our Nation is gripped by mounting cri-
ses, spurred by the failed policies of the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
congres-
sional Democrats. 
While Americans are hurting from 
the rising prices caused by inflation, a 
porous and open border, and a supply 
chain that is hurting every part of the 
American economy, it is critical that 
we remember and refocus on the funda-
mental values that have made our 
country great, starting with the right 
to life. 
For me, this is an incredibly personal 
issue, like it is for millions of Ameri-
cans with deeply held beliefs and per-
sonal 
experiences. 
I, 
myself, 
have 
shared my story on this very floor, 
that I shouldn’t even be standing here, 
that my mother was urged to abort me. 
I was not wanted. I was unexpected and 
I was given very little chance to sur-
vive. And yet, here I am. Again, this 
speaks to the miracle of life. 
We have the opportunity, brought on 
by the Dobbs v. Jackson case presented 
before the Supreme Court to chart a 
new course for our Nation so that every 
unborn child has the right to life and 
the opportunity that it holds while liv-
ing in America. 
Roe v. Wade has cost the lives of mil-
lions of American children, but what 
we have is the remarkable opportunity 
to make it right today. Today is the 
turning point. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to join 
dozens of my Republican colleagues to 
voice our support and stand for those 
most vulnerable, the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN-
BERRY), my colleague, a pro-life cham-
pion. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida for yielding. And I also thank Con-
gresswoman CAMMACK for her powerful, 
personal testimony. I am glad you are 
here today. Thank you so much for 
your leadership. 
Madam Speaker, beneath you, right 
underneath this dais right here, are 
five very powerful words. And we are so 
busy in this Chamber debating numer-
ous things we don’t even look at them. 
But there they are, right there. 
It says: Union, justice, tolerance, lib-
erty, and peace. And we all say we 
want unity. We all want justice. We 
say we want tolerance and, of course, 
we value liberty. And all of these beau-
tiful virtues point to the possibility of 
peace. But here is the problem: We 
leave out one group of persons, expect-
ant mothers and their pre-born chil-
dren. And the question before us today 
is why? Why? 
That was the question that was de-
bated today right across the street 
here at the Supreme Court. Why? 
We don’t have to live like this. What 
we can do is live in authentic commu-
nity with one another, where every 
person matters, including the expect-
ant mother and her pre-born child. 
That is called a community of care, 
where a tolerant, just, and inclusive so-
ciety commits to this journey of life 
before birth, at birth, and after birth. 
b 1700 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and colleague. 
We do have an important opportunity 
here, and I am so pleased to have such 
an overwhelming number of colleagues 
here today to talk about and share 
their journey and their support on this 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), 
my friend and colleague, to talk about 
another pressing issue that has im-
pacted American families across the 
country. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend and 
classmate, Representative CAMMACK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress the Nation’s self-inflicted energy 
crisis created by the Biden administra-
tion. 
The American people are feeling the 
strain of Biden’s anti-energy policies 
that are causing costs to skyrocket. 
Americans are paying 61 percent more 
nationally for a gallon of gas and heat-
ing costs are projected to rise 54 per-
cent this winter. 
What actions has Biden taken to 
undo the damage he has caused?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6840 
December 1, 2021 
Begged foreign countries to increase 
global output. Last week, he tapped 
into our Nation’s emergency reserve. 
America will be less secure if we 
aren’t properly stocked with petro-
leum. We will be at a disadvantage fi-
nancially and defensively, making us 
increasingly dependent on countries 
like Russia and China. 
Sadly, Madam Speaker, these poli-
cies place an undue burden on Ameri-
cans at a time when few can afford the 
extra expense. Inflated prices on daily 
necessities are a tax on low- and mid-
dle-class Americans, and Biden’s con-
tinuous anti-energy policies impact 
virtually every part of American lives. 
Increasing domestic production of oil 
and gas would not only consistently 
keep prices low, but also boost our 
economy, create jobs, and preserve our 
energy security. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Okla-
homa, my good friend. I thank her for 
talking about an issue that impacts ev-
eryday Americans, but also an issue 
that has absolutely hit the homes of 
every American, and particularly those 
that are working class. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, my faith and belief in God are 
the catalyst for every decision I make, 
and I am committed to protecting the 
most vulnerable among us. 
We all have a moral responsibility to 
defend the right to life, which begins at 
conception. Today, the Supreme Court 
heard oral arguments in the monu-
mental case of Dobbs v. Jackson Wom-
en’s Health Organization. This case 
concerns Mississippi’s law passed in 
2018, which limits abortion at 15 weeks 
gestation to medical emergencies in 
cases of severe fetal disability. 
The Court is expected to decide 
whether laws like Mississippi’s aimed 
at protecting unborn children pre-via-
bility align with the Constitution. 
I hope and pray that the Justices will 
be guided by righteousness, by a re-
spect for human dignity, by proper con-
stitutional interpretation, and by mod-
ern science to uphold Mississippi’s law, 
and protect the lives of the unborn. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), as he is going to talk about 
another issue that is front and center 
today that is really hitting the pocket-
books of everyday Americans. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida, 
my good friend, for yielding and for 
creating this opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, just a short time 
ago America was energy independent. 
The American people had access to af-
fordable energy and the U.S. led the 
world in carbon emissions reductions. 
What a difference 1 year and one ad-
ministration can make, Madam Speak-
er. 
Americans are paying the most they 
have paid at the pump since 2014, gaso-
line prices are up 45 percent in Penn-
sylvania. With winter fast approaching, 
home heating prices are projected to 
rise even above 50 percent—54 percent 
for some American households. 
The Biden administration’s solution 
is to literally double down on the failed 
energy policies. This is creating na-
tional security issues and real issues 
for every American, and certainly 
every Pennsylvanian. 
Along the way, some of the solutions 
from the Biden administration have 
been to beg Russia and OPEC countries 
to please produce and ship more, to tap 
the strategic oil reserve—which is a re-
serve 
for 
emergencies 
and 
catas-
trophes, meanwhile, it is yielding only 
3 days’ worth of oil—and a proposed in-
creased cost to produce oil and gas on 
Federal lands. 
With actions like this, we shouldn’t 
be surprised when we hear the White 
House press secretary argue that high-
er gas prices somehow highlight the 
need for the rapid transition to clean 
energy. This is ridiculous. It is woke 
gone mad and it is quite deliberately 
manipulative. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion have virtually done everything in 
their power to decimate domestic fuel 
production by holding up the Keystone 
pipeline, pausing the oil and gas leas-
ing on U.S. lands, and actually even 
discouraging our banks from investing 
in traditional forms of energy and pro-
duction. 
So out of respect for time, we can all 
appreciate the goal for a cleaner envi-
ronment and reduction in carbon emis-
sions, but it must be done in a manner 
that is economically feasible and not 
damaging to the American people and 
our constituents who we are supposed 
to be representing. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, it 
is almost like my colleague makes too 
much sense when it comes to the issue 
of energy production and protecting 
our critical domestic energy supply. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT 
FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate you rec-
ognizing me for a couple of moments 
here, a fellow friend from just up I–75 
in central Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of every American taxpayer who is 
infuriated by the wasteful spending of 
our government. For many months 
now, Republicans like me have been 
taking to the floor to sound the alarm 
on the Biden administration’s ridicu-
lous and wasteful spending. 
As hardworking Americans are strug-
gling with the highest inflation in over 
30 years, President Biden wants to con-
tinue doling out taxpayer money by 
the billions—to things like tree equity 
and studies to determine the effect of 
climate change on lactating individ-
uals. 
We have all been taught there is no 
such thing as a free lunch. When your 
government 
is 
spending 
money 
it 
doesn’t have, like it is going out of 
style, you better hold on to your wal-
let. 
The Washington Times recently re-
ported more than 40 percent of the $700 
billion in COVID unemployment bene-
fits went to fraudsters, including many 
connected to state sponsors in China 
and Russia. 
For context, the relief money lost to 
fraud could have provided $160,000 to 
every American family living under 
the poverty line or paid for an Ivy 
league education for every 18-year-old 
in the country. Instead, this money 
now sits in the coffers of our enemies 
who will surely use it against us. 
It is bad enough that irresponsible 
Democrat policies have created infla-
tion that is hurting American families, 
but the lack of oversight of hundreds of 
billions of dollars means that we are 
funding our enemies. 
This kind of fraud, waste, and abuse 
should be thoroughly investigated by 
Congress. Unfortunately, Republicans 
are in the minority, for now, we don’t 
have the authority to determine which 
investigations will be held. 
I hope my Democrat colleagues share 
my concern and outrage. What they do 
with this information will tell us all we 
know about how they feel about squan-
dering hard-earned taxpayer dollars. 
The American people deserve answers 
and a solution that ensures fraud like 
this can never happen again. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the Sunshine State. These are incred-
ibly important points about the econ-
omy. We are seeing over and over, ex-
ample after example the failures of this 
administration and how it is impacting 
working-class families. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for yielding and for the amazing exam-
ple that she is in her leadership to our 
entire Congress. 
Madam Speaker, of particular con-
cern to myself and many of my con-
stituents in south Jersey is the Demo-
crats’ attempt to stuff their tax and 
spend reconciliation bill, or as I like to 
call it, the big, bad bill, with massive 
expansions to the IRS. 
In order to pay for this monstrosity 
of a bill, Democrats are looking to hire 
more than 87,000 IRS agents. This army 
of auditors have the singular goal of 
spying on private transactions of mil-
lions of Americans and our small busi-
nesses. 
And it isn’t the ultra-rich that they 
are going to be going after. With a 
threshold of only $10,000 a year, nearly 
every American who has a job will be 
targeted. This is despicable at best and 
anti-American at its worst. 
Biden administration policies are al-
ready leading the way to rampant in-
flation and to job shortages. The last 
thing the American people need is to

worry that their daily transactions 
will become the target of the IRS. 
Unsurprisingly, this policy received 
near unanimous support from House 
Democrats, 
despite 
the 
widespread 
backlash it received from the Amer-
ican public. 
Madam Speaker, I implore the Sen-
ate to strip this dangerous provision 
before it ever become laws. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Again, he hits on points that just make 
too much sense. We know that the so- 
called Build Back Better bill does 
nothing more than build the bureauc-
racy, the same bureaucracy that is 
strangling everyday Americans and 
keeping them from prosperity. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS), my 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, Members of 
the Republican Party are standing up 
to talk about important issues that we 
believe are not only important to us 
that we feel very strongly about, but 
also to America, who is listening for 
clearness and clarity of issues about 
ideas. 
Tonight, I would like to stand up and 
talk about the life issue. I want to talk 
about it a little bit differently. I am 
the father of a Down’s syndrome young 
man. Many times, Down’s syndrome 
children might be considered, before 
they are born, as something that might 
not be as respected or wanted by a fam-
ily. 
Tonight, what I would like to say is 
that our children are important. Our 
children that are given to us are gifts 
of God. 
While each of us think of ourselves as 
being special, we need to think about 
our children, the next generation of 
not only this country, but of God’s 
children. My son, who is now 25 years 
old, Alexander Gregory Sessions, who 
was born into a family that placed high 
value on him—not just his life, but his 
value that he has grown in throughout 
his life. 
Alex, in many instances, has some 
limitations about him. Alex is an Eagle 
Scout and a young man who gets up 
every day prepared and ready for the 
things that will greet him and the 
world that he will greet. Many times, 
so many people are respectable—they 
respect Alex and not only his willing-
ness to live life, but also to come and 
be a part of society and to do the 
things that are important. 
So tonight, my message is not just to 
you, Madam Speaker, but the Amer-
ican people—the American people who 
need to know that life is so important 
and the children that many women 
carry not only will offer solutions to 
our future, but make our country bet-
ter. 
For those parents that might be fac-
ing difficult circumstances, and per-
haps uncertainty about what they 
think or feel about the emotion of hav-
ing perhaps a disabled child, I want to 
stand up and say: You will be rewarded. 
You have been selected by God to be 
the parent of a special angel, a child 
who will mean so much to so many 
people that will bring joy and love and 
admiration. It will be something that 
will be a lifelong gift, probably, and 
something that is to be cherished and 
important. 
On behalf of my Republican col-
leagues, we do stand up and talk about 
how important life is and how much we 
believe these children and others con-
tribute. We also want to say this— 
thank you to God for selecting us as 
parents. We are proud of the responsi-
bility that we have and offer our 
thanks to You. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for sharing his 
deeply personal experience, that means 
the world. I know that constituents 
and Americans hear your message and 
respect and appreciate it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my 
friend and colleague. I believe we share 
a common county in Putnam County. 
We both get the privilege of rep-
resenting a wonderful county called 
Putnam County, even though they are 
in two different States. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Florida for yielding 
to me tonight. And in fact, Putnam 
County is my home county. 
Madam Speaker, Tennesseans and 
Americans throughout the country who 
are already hurting from higher prices, 
widespread 
shortages, 
and 
fewer 
choices believe President Biden’s Build 
Back Better agenda will cause infla-
tion to skyrocket even further. 
This social spending scam breaks 
President Biden’s zero-cost promise. 
Contrary to what President Biden and 
his far left Democratic allies have con-
sistently maintained, this bill is not 
fully paid for. In fact, it is not even 
close. 
According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, the CBO, it is 
expected to add $367 billion to the na-
tional debt. That is a massive amount 
of deficit spending that our children 
and grandchildren will have to pay 
back, but it doesn’t even begin to tell 
the whole story. The Democrats used a 
long list of budgetary gimmicks to ar-
tificially lower the CBO score spending 
number of $367 billion. 
The highly respected Wharton School 
of Business performed their own expert 
analysis without budget gimmicks, and 
they found that the actual amount of 
deficit spending from Biden’s socialist 
Build Back Better legislation will, in 
fact, add over $300 billion to the na-
tional debt.

Americans all across the country and 
from all walks of life can sense how bad 
this bill is going to affect our economy 
and add to our already sky-high infla-
tion rate. 
Democrats’ Build Back Better bill is 
not just extraordinarily costly, it is 
also destructive. To put it simply, as 
radical as this tax-and-spend spending 
spree is, other aspects of this bill are 
just as bad. While far left Democrats 
and Speaker PELOSI proudly revel in 
the passage of this bill, it is clear they 
have no connection to the needs and 
wants of the hardworking Tennesseans 
whom I represent, nor the majority of 
Americans across the country. 
As my colleagues and I have covered, 
the provisions within this bill amount 
to a wish list of far left socialist poli-
cies that will have devastating con-
sequences 
on 
American 
businesses, 
households, and families. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Tennessee 
for his remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT), who is my good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
am glad the gentlewoman’s mama 
chose life. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the opportunity to be here. 
Joe Biden’s build back broke agenda 
is for the coastal elites, not working 
Americans or middle class families. In-
creasing State and local tax deductions 
benefits rich Americans living in deep 
blue States. We all know the liberal 
media refuses to report it. This is a tax 
break for the wealthy, and we all know 
it. Even BERNIE SANDERS of all people 
is calling out President Biden for 
sneaking this into his agenda. So much 
for Biden’s cries for the wealthy to 
‘‘pay their fair share.’’ 
Well, it looks like who is paying 
their fair share are working Ameri-
cans, once again. 
There is also the $7,500 tax credit for 
electric vehicle purchases. Most Ameri-
cans can’t afford electric vehicles that 
cost an average of over $55,000, but I 
will tell you who can; liberals in Cali-
fornia and New York have no problem 
whatsoever paying for this. It affords 
them this opportunity with this enor-
mous tax credit—or as my daughter 
would say, ginormous. 
Another tax benefit for the wealthy. 
Heck, most Americans can’t even af-
ford to drive their regular cars right 
now because gas prices are too high. 
What makes Biden think we will be 
able to foot the bill for an electric car? 
Speaking of gas prices, build back 
broke ramps up the attacks on domes-
tic energy production. This will make 
us all more reliant on foreign oil. Biden 
started this war on affordable energy 
the day he took office, and build back 
broke will make it worse. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Tennessee 
for his remarks. They are very impor-
tant points that he made, and I encour-
age everyone to watch his speech re-
peatedly on YouTube once they post it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), 
who is my friend and fellow cochair of

the Pro-Life Caucus. Representative 
SMITH is a true pro-life champion. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her extraordinary leadership. 
Madam Speaker, injustice need not 
be forever. By affirming the Mississippi 
pro-life law, the Supreme Court can 
take a powerful step toward inclusion, 
justice, and respect for the weakest 
and most vulnerable. 
Shockingly, since the infamous 1973 
abortion decisions, more than 62.5 mil-
lion unborn children have been killed— 
a staggering loss of children’s lives 
that equates with the entire population 
of Italy. 
Abrogating both duty and due dili-
gence, the 1973 Court wrote: ‘‘We need 
not resolve the difficult question of 
when human life begins.’’ 
Sidestepping that threshold and giv-
ing no benefit of the doubt to the child, 
they went on to legalize abortion on 
demand as if the baby were a tumor to 
be excised or a disease to be van-
quished. 
For decades, right up to this very 
moment, abortion advocates have gone 
to extraordinary lengths to ignore, 
trivialize, and cover up the battered 
baby victim. But today, thanks to 
ultrasound, unborn babies are more 
visible than ever before. 
This begs the question: Why does dis-
membering a child with sharp knives, 
pulverizing a child with powerful suc-
tion devices, or chemically poisoning a 
baby with any number of toxic chemi-
cals fail to elicit so much as a scintilla 
of empathy, mercy, or compassion? 
Madam Speaker, someday future gen-
erations of Americans will look back 
on us and wonder how and why such a 
rich and seemingly enlightened soci-
ety, professing to be devoted to human 
rights and so blessed and endowed with 
the capacity to protect the vulnerable, 
could have instead so aggressively pro-
moted death to children and the exploi-
tation of women by abortion. 
Injustice, Madam Speaker, need not 
be forever. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of New Jersey for his 
beautiful comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKIN-
LEY). 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Madam Speaker, today the Supreme 
Court will hear a case that could deter-
mine the future of unborn children. For 
nearly 50 years, the Federal decision of 
Roe v. Wade has threatened the lives of 
the unborn. This is a decision that 
should be left to the States. 
In 1973 Justices were told that un-
born babies could not live on their own 
until the 28th week. But since then, 
there have been major advances in 
medicine. We now know that as early 
as 5 weeks unborn babies have a heart-
beat and their brains are beginning to 
develop; by 10 weeks the babies have 
legs and arms that can kick; and by 15 
weeks babies can taste, yawn, suck 
their thumb, and, more importantly, 
they can feel pain. They are living, 
breathing, and feeling human beings 
who deserve a chance to live. 
Jeremiah and Isaiah said in the Bible 
that the Lord spoke to them in the 
womb: ‘‘Before you were born, I set you 
apart.’’ 
Both these prophets were trying to 
tell us something: Every life is pre-
cious. Therefore, Congress has a moral 
obligation to protect the lives of our 
vulnerable, unborn children and to be 
their voice. 
Today I hope the Supreme Court will 
agree. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from the great 
State of West Virginia for his words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I have observed multiple 
times when we open our daily session 
in prayer that we are praying to Cre-
ator God, acknowledging that God is 
our creator. He is also the giver of life. 
I am proud of my five daughters who 
cherish this blessing from our Creator 
and have blessed us with 17 grand-
children. 
The abortion industry talks about 
pregnancy as if it is a cancer diagnosis. 
How sad and tragic that Planned Par-
enthood and the chemical abortion in-
dustry have targeted and deceived 
young women for their own profit. 
Today, we have been praying for wis-
dom and for God’s guiding hand over 
the Supreme Court as it hears the 
Dobbs v. Jackson case. This case could 
mark the biggest win for human life in 
America in decades. In Illinois’ 15th 
Congressional District, we honor and 
respect the dignity of all stages of life, 
born and unborn. Pro-life Americans 
believe all life has value, no matter 
how small. 
I also have a little grandson who has 
Down syndrome. He is just precious. 
His name is Nathaniel, and that means 
a gift from God. 
With the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization case, the Court 
can correct the dreadful ruling of Roe 
v. Wade and acknowledge that the deci-
sion wasn’t constitutional or based in 
reality. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from Il-
linois for her comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we stand on the 
doorstep of delivering pro-life protec-
tions for unborn babies. Today the Su-
preme Court heard oral arguments in 
the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health 
Organization. The case will decide the 
constitutionality of a Mississippi law 
that supports life by banning abortion 
that takes place more than 15 weeks 
after conception. 
It is my hope that the Supreme Court 
will uphold the constitutionality of 
this law, which will set the stage for 
Roe v. Wade to be overturned, ushering 
in a new era where life is valued and 
protected. 
Nothing is more important than life. 
If we are not going to stand and pro-
tect life, we will stand and protect 
nothing. If my time in Congress is re-
membered for one thing, let it be that 
I fought to defend the sanctity of life. 
That is why I wear these precious feet 
on my collar—the exact size and shape 
of a baby’s feet 10 weeks after concep-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I will always sup-
port life. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks 
and for continuing to be a champion 
for pro-life and the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I appreciate her hosting 
this today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in de-
fense of the lives of our unborn chil-
dren. I am proud to stand with my col-
leagues without apology on the side of 
life. 
Roe v. Wade was one of the Supreme 
Court’s biggest failures. Today our Jus-
tices have an opportunity to right that 
wrong. 
At 5 weeks a baby’s heart begins 
beating. At 10 weeks the child has 
arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That baby 
can kick and jump if startled while in 
the womb. They can taste and make fa-
cial expressions, yawn, hiccup, and 
suck their thumbs. Those are the ac-
tions of a child, not a clump of cells. 
More importantly, that child starts 
to feel pain only 3 weeks into develop-
ment. Inflicting unnecessary pain on 
an innocent child in the womb is not 
healthcare. Abortion is not healthcare. 
This is not healthcare. This is a child, 
a life. 
Madam Speaker, abortion is an evil 
that has plagued this country for 50 
long years. I call for the Supreme 
Court to act and to defend the lives and 
rights of our unborn. We must put an 
end to this torturous practice that has 
denied almost 20 percent of young chil-
dren their constitutional right to life. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman from Geor-
gia’s remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), 
who is my friend and colleague, to talk 
about how he is a champion for life and 
why it is so important. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my fellow Florida Gator. I was 
born in Gainesville, Florida, and raised 
in the Tampa Bay area. I am very 
blessed to be a Floridian and with this 
wonderful woman here. I thank her for 
doing this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to stand 
for life. Earlier the United States Su-
preme Court began hearing opening ar-
guments in the Dobbs v. Jackson Wom-
en’s Health Organization case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6843 
December 1, 2021 
As this landmark case is litigated, I 
am mindful that modern science con-
firms every unborn child is a human 
life. As early as 5 weeks, unborn babies 
have a heartbeat and the brain and spi-
nal cord are developing. By 10 weeks 
babies have arms and legs, fingers and 
toes; they can kick and jump if star-
tled. At 15 weeks babies have fully de-
veloped hearts that pump 26 quarts of 
blood per day. 
Madam Speaker, they can taste and 
make facial expressions. They yawn, 
they hiccup, they swallow, and they 
even suck their thumbs. During this 
time period, painful procedures trigger 
a hormonal stress response, and due to 
advances in technology, an unborn 
child is viable outside the womb at 22 
weeks or earlier. 
Our laws must reflect these realities 
and be realigned to protect the unborn. 
b 1730 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my fellow Floridian and cham-
pion for life, Representative BILIRAKIS. 
I yield to the gentleman from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), 
my friend and champion for life. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the unborn. 
Babies deserve the right to live, and 
we have a responsibility to defend that 
right. Today, the Supreme Court is 
considering the most critical abortion 
case since Roe v. Wade was tragically 
decided 50 years ago. It has been 50 
years too long, 50 years of abortions, 50 
years of abandoning the defenseless, 
and 50 years of Federal laws that vio-
late the conscience of the vast major-
ity of Americans, Americans who sup-
port life and who are opposed to their 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars funding 
abortion. 
But today, the Supreme Court has 
the opportunity to protect that right 
to life. It is an opportunity that the 
State of Texas is championing. Since 
the passing of the heartbeat bill in 
Texas on September 1, almost 10,000 
Texan babies have been saved, and now 
pregnancy help centers and other wom-
en’s health clinics outnumber abortion 
clinics 20 to 1. The State now spends 
$100 million on abortion alternative 
services, including medical care and 
counseling. 
I want to put this in perspective. As 
somebody who served in the military, 
most countries ascribe to the law of 
armed conflict. When an enemy com-
batant asks for mercy and asks for 
their life to be saved, it is the law of 
armed conflict that directs combatants 
to save that life. Yet, in America, we 
are not saving the lives of innocent ba-
bies. 
I am urging the Supreme Court to 
make the right decision. I am praying 
for those Justices to save the lives of 
the unborn. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Texas for his com-
ments. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. WALORSKI), one of my favor-
ite Hoosiers. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Today is a truly historic day for our 
Nation as the Supreme Court considers 
a landmark challenge to Roe v. Wade. 
This is a vital opportunity for the 
highest court in the land to rightfully 
strike down this deadly decision and 
restore the dignity of life in our Na-
tion. 
Our country was founded on the self- 
evident truths that all people are cre-
ated equally by our creator and en-
dowed with inalienable rights. Every 
child has the God-given right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
For nearly 50 years, our Nation has 
been plagued by a callous disregard for 
these fundamental principles—Roe v. 
Wade, an abomination that destroys 
life and our Nation’s greatest poten-
tial. 
Abortion is sold as healthcare or 
women’s empowerment. It is a viola-
tion of human dignity that all Ameri-
cans should not and cannot tolerate. 
Protecting life empowers women and 
defends the most basic rights. I am 
proud to stand with millions of pro-life 
Americans as we speak up for the 
voiceless and the most vulnerable 
among us. The truth is on our side, and 
the truth will prevail. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Amen. I thank my 
friend and colleague from Indiana for 
her comments. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), my 
friend, colleague, and champion for 
life. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman so much, my good 
friend and colleague from Florida, Rep-
resentative CAMMACK, for this Special 
Order hour. 
Madam Speaker, this is a baby at 15 
weeks old. He or she can sense light, 
make facial expressions, and feel pain. 
The beating of their fully functioning 
heart can be heard on an ultrasound, 
and all of their major organs are being 
developed. 
Today, the Supreme Court heard oral 
arguments in the Dobbs v. Jackson 
case. In the coming months, it will rule 
on 
whether 
Mississippi 
and 
other 
States like them can prohibit the mur-
der of an unborn baby after 15 weeks of 
age. 
Currently, the United States is one of 
seven nations, including North Korea 
and China, that allow abortion on de-
mand after a baby can feel pain. I don’t 
know about you, Madam Speaker, but I 
am appalled that our standard of 
human rights for the unborn is so low 
that we actually align with nations 
like North Korea and China. 
When will the so-called party of 
science actually accept the science 
proving that life begins at conception? 
I am earnestly praying that the Su-
preme Court makes the right and the 
just decision to allow States to con-
tinue defending the very most innocent 
among us. 
But no matter the outcome, I will 
never surrender the fight for our un-
born. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
Texas for participating. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD), my 
friend, colleague, and fellow champion 
for life. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida for yielding. 
More than 60 million lives have been 
lost since the treacherous, devastating, 
and dishonest Roe v. Wade decision by 
seven misguided Justices nearly 50 
years ago—60 million. 
The big lie is that there is a constitu-
tional right to abortion, a constitu-
tional right to take the life of a pre-
cious, innocent child in the womb. How 
have we let this stand for nearly 50 
years? How can there not be one lone 
honest, compassionate voice on the 
other side, hearing and responding to 
the unborn cries from the womb? 
What kind of a compromise must you 
make in your soul when there is no 
longer any honest denial of the science 
of life? What kind of a compromise 
must you make to vote for political ex-
pediency to satisfy the loudest, most 
aggressive special interest groups and 
vote to remove any restrictions on 
abortion? 
How did we get to where one party is 
100 percent unanimous in supporting 
unlimited, taxpayer-funded abortion at 
any time for any reason? 
How 
did 
those 
who 
previously 
claimed the pro-life label and support 
for the Hyde provision at a minimum— 
back when we didn’t have the sci-
entific, visual proof of life—how do 
they now enthusiastically defend unre-
stricted abortion? 
Yet, we find ourselves today on the 
precipice of the Supreme Court having 
the opportunity to finally, at long last, 
reverse this decision. May these Jus-
tices have courage. May they do what 
is right. May they do what is moral. 
May they do what is lawful. May they 
preserve and protect life. May they fi-
nally overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
his passion and testimony. It is truly 
moving. 
I yield to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), my friend and col-
league. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the gentlewoman for or-
ganizing this evening. 
I am proud to join so many of my col-
leagues here tonight to stand up for 
the unborn. Since the tragic 1973 Roe v. 
Wade ruling, more than 60 million 
preborn children in America have had 
their lives cut short. This is absolutely 
heartbreaking, and we must continue 
our efforts to end the devastating prac-
tice of abortion in America. 
Fortunately, the pro-life movement 
grows stronger by the day, and there is 
an army of folks across this country 
who serve as voices for the voiceless 
and defenders of the defenseless. 
One saying that gets repeated around 
this Chamber a lot is ‘‘follow the

science.’’ Well, science tells us that the 
preborn are, in fact, human beings. 
This is an undeniable fact. At 6 weeks, 
an unborn baby has a heartbeat. At 7 
weeks, they develop pain receptors. By 
10 weeks, an unborn child has arms, 
legs, fingers, and toes, and can begin to 
kick. At 15 weeks, a preborn human 
being has a fully developed heart. 
Yet, through all of this time and well 
beyond, the pro-abortion movement be-
lieves this child has no right to life. 
But God willing, the ability to protect 
preborn life will soon be even greater 
in the United States. 
The Supreme Court today heard ar-
guments in Dobbs v. Jackson that will 
address the question of the constitu-
tionality of previability bans on abor-
tion. We must protect our unborn citi-
zens, and I am hopeful that the Su-
preme Court will soon recognize that 
right to life. 
Since the first day I was elected, I 
have worked to advance the truth that 
the pro-life movement supports. On 
this day, I am more committed than 
ever to ensuring that truth always pre-
vails. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for all the work 
that he has done to protect life. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA), a 
true champion for life. 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as the United States Su-
preme Court is considering one of the 
most consequential cases of my life-
time. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson, will 
have enormous implications for the fu-
ture. Simply put, it will determine 
whether abortions performed before a 
baby is considered viable are lawful. 
Here is why this is so important. As 
early as 5 weeks, unborn babies are 
forming blood vessels. By 10 weeks, 
pain receptors have start developing. 
At 15 weeks, babies have developed 
hearts and pump 17 quarts of blood per 
day. 
With its potential to overturn the 50- 
year-old law, Roe v. Wade, and save 
millions of unborn children, Dobbs v. 
Jackson is a beacon of hope for inno-
cent life. This is why earlier this year 
I joined dozens of my pro-life col-
leagues in signing a brief urging the 
Supreme Court to uphold the Mis-
sissippi law in question that outlaws 
abortions after 15 weeks. 
There is nothing more fundamental 
and sacred in our Constitution than the 
right to life. I humbly ask that you 
join me in praying for the Supreme 
Court to uphold the previability re-
strictions on abortions. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Iowa for his com-
ments. 
I can’t tell you how encouraging it is 
to hear so many of my colleagues fight 
and stand for life, but I can say with 
certainty that there is probably no one 
who has fought harder than Represent-
ative HARTZLER for not just life but our 
values. I can’t thank the gentlewoman 
enough for her work. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative CAMMACK
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to advo-
cate for Missouri’s children, both born 
and unborn, and to urge my colleagues 
to embrace the science of life. 
We know children yet to be born are 
miracles. Windows into the womb re-
veal that at a mere 6 weeks, a baby’s 
heart begins beating; at 7 weeks, a 
baby develops pain receptors; at 10 
weeks, a baby can kick and jump if 
startled. Between 13 and 14 weeks, a 
baby will respond to light touches. By 
15 weeks, a baby can taste, make facial 
expressions, yawn, hiccup, swallow, 
and suck her thumb. By this point, a 
baby’s tiny heart has beaten nearly 16 
million times. 
Each week that passes marks a mile-
stone in a child’s development, a cele-
bration of life. Yet, our country re-
mains under the shadow of outdated 
Supreme Court decisions that allowed 
these tiny humans to be aborted. 
While the United States is a leader 
when it comes to understanding in 
utero development and surgical proce-
dures, our laws are antiquated and rad-
ical compared to other nations when it 
comes to protecting life in the womb. 
In fact, we are only one of seven coun-
tries across the globe that allow for 
abortion on demand after a baby feels 
pain, alongside human rights-violating 
countries like China and North Korea. 
In Europe, 47 out of 50 countries limit 
abortion at 15 weeks or earlier, like the 
law being discussed in the Dobbs case. 
It is time we allowed our laws to be 
updated to reflect what we have always 
known to be true about the humanity, 
dignity, and worth of the unborn. It is 
time for the Supreme Court to protect 
life. It is time that they right this 
wrong. Let’s pray they rule rightly. 
Millions of lives, literally, hang in the 
balance. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend and colleague so 
much. I am so proud of the work that 
she has done to advance not just our 
pro-life cause, but also American val-
ues. I thank the gentlewoman for her 
tireless work. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), my friend, colleague, and 
another pro-life champion, even though 
he 
is, 
affectionately, 
my 
favorite 
cheesehead. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
As was just said, the United States 
today is one of only seven countries 
around the world with such extreme 
pro-abortion laws. It is a little bit un-
usual, of all countries, this country, 
which John Adams said was formed 
only for moral and religious people, 
would have somehow gotten all turned 
around and wrapped around the axle so 
that we have now become, along with 
countries like Red China or North 
Korea, countries known around the 
world for barbarity, as a country that 
is that extreme. 
In the United States, the vast major-
ity of people lived in areas in which 
abortion was illegal since before the 
Civil War. We had a decision, Roe v. 
Wade, typical of the extreme decisions 
of people who, I guess, spent too much 
time learning in law school, who felt 
that in our Constitution we found 
something that virtually every church 
at the time would have considered bar-
baric. 
b 1745 
By the way, abortion was illegal be-
fore the days of the ultrasound. Now, 
with the ultrasound it is so obvious 
that we have got something precious, 
created by God that we are destroying. 
But even before the ultrasound, the av-
erage American understood how bar-
baric this was, and virtually every 
State barred abortion. 
We can only hope that the arguments 
across the street are the beginning of 
the march back of the United States 
towards the God-fearing Nation it was 
intended to be. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Wisconsin for those 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER), a pro- 
life champion and voice for the unborn. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, an unborn child is a human life. All 
you have to do is realize that. 
Sixty-two 
million 
unborn 
human 
lives have been killed since Roe v. 
Wade. That is almost 1.3 million a year 
of unborn human lives killed. That is 
almost 3,500 a day or one every 2 min-
utes. 
Madam Speaker, in my 90 seconds, 
two unborn human lives have been 
snuffed out. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
his powerful remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), my 
good friend and fellow champion for 
life. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, in light 
of the U.S. Supreme Court oral argu-
ments for the landmark Dobbs v. Jack-
son case earlier today, I would like to 
highlight what is truly at stake here; 
that is, millions of precious, innocent 
lives. 
It all comes down to one simple fact: 
The presence of a heartbeat means the 
existence of life. 
As early as 5 weeks, unborn babies in 
the womb can have a heartbeat. Fur-
thermore, they start developing pain 
receptors just 2 short weeks later and 
are able to process pain by 15 weeks. 
Anyone who claims an unborn child 
is not a human life is ignoring science, 
denying morality, and condoning mur-
der. That is right: Murder. 
Even President Biden acknowledged 
back in 2015, ‘‘The moment of concep-
tion is a human life and being.’’ On this 
rare occasion, I sincerely agree with 
the President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6845 
December 1, 2021 
As an unapologetic pro-life Amer-
ican, I will never stop fighting for the 
sanctity of human life or defending the 
unborn. 
While we wait for further develop-
ments in this pivotal legal case, I am 
hopeful the eventual outcome will save 
countless innocent human lives and 
not add to the already 60-plus million 
who have lost their lives to abortion. 
To put that number of 60-plus million 
into some perspective, the number of 
Americans killed in combat in the en-
tire history of our Nation, starting 
from the war of independence, is just 
under 667,000, or about 1 percent of the 
60-plus million unborn babies who have 
died during the last five decades. 
I pray this crucial moment will con-
firm for all Americans that every life 
is precious, worth saving, and made in 
the perfect image of God. That revela-
tion is a victory we should all cele-
brate. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD), 
another pro-life champion, an incred-
ible Member of Congress, and a friend. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Florida for 
hosting this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today along-
side my colleagues, my constituents, 
and millions of Americans in support of 
life and in defense of the democratic 
process. 
Human life begins at conception. 
Just 5 weeks into a pregnancy, an un-
born baby’s heart begins to beat. At 10 
weeks, they have fingers and toes. 
However, for 48 years, the Roe v. 
Wade decision has trampled on the 
democratic process and the unborn. 
Since the 1973 decision, over 62 mil-
lion abortions have been performed. 
That is over 1 million per year. This is 
a disgraceful attack on human life. 
It is imperative that the legislative 
powers to make laws, especially of this 
magnitude, be vested in the people’s 
representatives and not nine unelected 
judges. 
Arkansans and citizens across this 
Nation want to protect life, but their 
hands have been tied by the Supreme 
Court. 
I urge the Supreme Court to overturn 
Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood 
v. Casey. It is time to return the abor-
tion debate back to where it belongs, 
with the people. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague for his 
remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), a 
friend, colleague, and a long-time pro- 
life champion. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate Mrs. CAMMACK having this 
Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, we ought to be con-
cerned 
about 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us. Most Americans believe in 
God, a Heavenly Father. Is it hard to 
imagine that it would be extremely im-
portant to such a Heavenly Father that 
we protect the lives that are most vul-
nerable, most innocent, particularly? 
Could there be anybody more innocent, 
more vulnerable, than a child that is 
still in the womb? 
I met Ramona Trevino some years 
back, and she had been a director of 
Planned Parenthood, I believe, in Sher-
man, Texas. She became shocked, hav-
ing a teenaged daughter, that they 
were taught that they should come be-
tween a daughter and her mother. 
Earlier, when they had directors’ 
meetings of other Planned Parenthood 
facilities, the number they were most 
interested in is how many girls you are 
getting on the pill and how early in 
age. The earlier, the better, because 
they are more likely to forget to take 
the pill and get pregnant, and then 
they would get to destroy the life of an 
unborn child. That is something that if 
there is a Heavenly Father, as I know 
there is, he would have to be very upset 
with us for allowing that to happen. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my great friend and colleague 
from Texas. I appreciate his continued 
work and efforts on this very impor-
tant issue. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is very 
fitting that as we close out tonight’s 
Special Order that started with the 
youngest Republican woman in Con-
gress, that we end with the youngest 
Republican man. Our generation con-
tinues to fight for the pro-life move-
ment, and we believe that we will be 
the generation that ends abortion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CAWTHORN), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the great warrior from Florida 
for her leadership on this matter. 
Madam Speaker, imagine you have 
just walked out of this Chamber and 
outside is a gorgeous sunset. You have 
a Polaroid camera, so you snap a beau-
tiful picture, and the gray photo prints 
out the front. You hold it and shake it, 
waiting for the picture to appear. Sud-
denly, someone walks by and snatches 
your photo, ripping it to shreds. 
You are stunned. You cry: Why did 
you destroy my picture? The person re-
plies: Oh, it wasn’t a picture. It wasn’t 
fully developed yet. All of us in this 
room realize how asinine that rea-
soning is. That photo was transforming 
into a beautiful image. 
This illustration by Seth Gruber is 
simple. But it is what our Nation has 
done to the most precious image of all, 
the image of God. 
Madam Speaker, a silent genocide 
has slipped beneath the conscience of 
America. Precious works of our Cre-
ator, formed and set apart, meet death 
before they have breathed life. Eternal 
souls, woven into earthen vessels, sanc-
tified by Almighty God and endowed 
with the miracle of life, are denied 
their birth by a Nation that was born 
in freedom. 
God’s breath of life blown away by 
the breath of man. 
This cruel and fallen world may seem 
too filthy for their very presence. But 
these precious temples are crafted in 
the image of God himself. One day, per-
haps when science darkens the soul of 
the left, our Nation will repent. But 
until then, the carnage of this uncon-
scionable deed will stain the fabric of 
our Nation. 
I hope that the Supreme Court over-
turns Roe v. Wade. I hope that we stop 
the genocide of abortion in this coun-
try. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of North Carolina. I am 
proud to be a representative alongside 
him as the pro-life generation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Mr. Adrian 
Swann, one of his secretaries. 
f 
THE BENEFITS OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
together with President Biden, this 
country has already created 5.6 million 
jobs this year alone. Growth is up, 
wages are up, and unemployment is at 
a figure that is at a low of a couple of 
generations at this point. 
And in the middle of all of this, 
Democrats had the temerity to enact 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, a historic occasion. 
The infrastructure law the Demo-
crats delivered will create millions 
more good-paying jobs—American jobs, 
union jobs, family-sustaining jobs, jobs 
that cannot be outsourced or sent off-
shore. 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act that was signed into 
law the week before last makes the 
largest Federal investment in public 
transit ever. It makes the largest Fed-
eral investment in passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak. It makes the 
single largest dedicated bridge invest-
ment since the construction of the 
Interstate Highway System. It makes 
the largest investment in clean drink-
ing water and wastewater infrastruc-
ture in American history. It ensures

that every American has access to reli-
able high-speed internet. It helps tack-
le the climate crisis by making the 
largest investment in clean energy 
transmission and electric vehicle infra-
structure in history. 
Madam Speaker, rebuilding our in-
frastructure means shoring up our 
American middle class. It means jobs, 
jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs. It 
means, maybe most importantly to a 
lot of us, honoring the work and the 
sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, 
those folks that Tom Brokaw called 
the Greatest Generation. They came 
back from World War II, from defeating 
fascism in the Pacific and the Atlantic, 
and they came back after making all of 
those sacrifices, suffering all of those 
hardships and deprivations and what 
did they do? They immediately set to 
work sacrificing more for their chil-
dren and their grandchildren, for us. 
They sacrificed for us, and they didn’t 
stop sacrificing. 
f 
b 1800 
What they did was they invested in 
American 
infrastructure: 
American 
water systems and sewer systems, and 
maybe above all and most recogniz-
able, the Eisenhower Interstate High-
way System, something that abso-
lutely made a revolutionary change in 
this country. 
It made it so much easier to get 
around this country. It made it so 
much quicker and cheaper and easier 
for American companies to get their 
manufactured goods to market. It 
made American companies more com-
petitive abroad, this investment in 
American 
infrastructure 
that 
the 
Greatest Generation made. 
And then after that, nothing. Noth-
ing. For 50, 60, 70 years, nothing. We 
acted in this country like a bunch of 
spoiled, rotten children, entitled little 
kids. The things that our parents did 
for us, the sacrifices that our parents 
and grandparents made for us were 
taken for granted. 
We figured that we didn’t have to 
make those sacrifices for our children 
and their grandchildren, that we didn’t 
have to continue to update and renew 
and maintain and develop that port-
folio of assets that was our American 
infrastructure that was handed down to 
us by that Greatest Generation. 
We didn’t think we had to beef up 
public transit or passenger rail or 
roads and bridges or drinking water 
and wastewater systems. We didn’t 
think we had to do those things be-
cause we took them for granted. We 
took them for granted generation after 
generation until this year, when Demo-
crats in the House delivered—what?— 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act that was signed into 
law. 
This past week, I want to tell you, 
House Democrats celebrated those jobs 
with more than 100 events across the 
country. 
In Georgia, Representative CAROLYN 
BOURDEAUX visited a local electric ve-
hicle manufacturer called SK Battery 
to celebrate investments in local jobs. 
In Illinois, Congresswoman CHERI 
BUSTOS visited a VA clinic where new 
investments in broadband will improve 
telehealth services for our American 
veterans. 
In 
Massachusetts, 
Representative 
JAKE AUCHINCLOSS sat down with the 
Massachusetts AFL–CIO to talk about 
good-paying union jobs coming to his 
district from this infrastructure law. 
In 
California, 
Congressman 
JIM 
COSTA met with local water districts to 
talk about much-needed water infra-
structure updates in California’s Cen-
tral Valley, where so many of our crops 
get grown. 
In upstate New York, we had a couple 
of Congressmen talking about infra-
structure. Congressman BRIAN HIGGINS, 
out of Buffalo, visited infrastructure 
projects in his home city, the queen 
city of Buffalo. And we had Congress-
man JOE MORELLE from Rochester, also 
in upstate New York, talking about 
how the infrastructure law will help 
that town of Rochester, New York, re-
move lead pipes. 
We all remember what happened in 
Flint, Michigan, where 100-year-old 
lead pipes poisoned little kids, gave 
them brain damage. Why? Well, be-
cause of a lot of things, but one of 
them was that we hadn’t updated the 
water infrastructure in 100 years in 
Flint, Michigan. 
JOE MORELLE was talking about that 
when 
he 
visited 
the 
Plug 
Power 
Gigafactory to tout the investments 
the law will make in clean hydrogen 
hubs and clean hydrogen manufac-
turing. He was talking about that, and 
he was talking about removing the lead 
pipes in Rochester so that these things 
don’t happen again. 
In southern California, Congressman 
MIKE LEVIN joined a Republican mayor 
from his California district to talk 
about how updates to infrastructure 
will help local drivers, cyclists, and pe-
destrians. 
In New Mexico, Congresswoman TE-
RESA LEGER FERNANDEZ visited Zuni 
High School to discuss how the infra-
structure law will improve access to 
broadband for students, and she toured 
the Navajo-Gallup water supply project 
with Navajo Nation President Jona-
than Nez. 
In north Texas, Congressman COLIN 
ALLRED held a teletownhall with folks 
in his district to talk about all the 
ways the law will help meet local 
transportation needs. 
In 
northern 
Ohio, 
Representative 
MARCY KAPTUR joined a summit about 
infrastructure to talk about how this 
law will help with flooding, with irriga-
tion, and pollution remediation. 
Also in California, Congresswoman 
DORIS MATSUI visited local levees in 
California that will be improved be-
cause of this infrastructure bill. 
Every single one of these projects 
represents jobs and economic growth 
for our local communities. It rep-
resents investment in America. It rep-
resents belief in our country, belief in 
ourselves, that we can make the best of 
what we can do for the economy; that 
we can create jobs; that we can make it 
in America; we can manufacture goods 
in this country; that we can compete 
with any other company in the world 
as long as we provide the necessary in-
frastructure 
advantages 
that 
other 
countries are already doing. 
And don’t think for one minute that 
China is not investing in its infrastruc-
ture to make its companies compete 
with us, that Russia is not doing it, 
that the European Union nations aren’t 
doing it. They are all doing it. What 
would ever make us think that we 
don’t have to compete with those com-
panies from countries abroad? You 
know we do. 
Look at the cargo ships lined up out-
side the ports off of southern Cali-
fornia. They are full of manufactured 
goods coming to this country for im-
port. It is one thing to look at a piece 
of paper and look at the trade imbal-
ance that America has suffered for 
years upon years. It is another thing to 
look at the pictures and the video of 
those container ships out in the har-
bors. Every one of those container 
ships, it takes 7,000 tractor-trailers to 
unload them, they are so full of goods 
coming to this country. 
Why we can’t make those goods in 
this country, a lot of it has to do with 
our suffering, with our falling behind 
in our infrastructure. Our companies 
need this. This is something we need to 
do to keep American companies com-
petitive. It is a jungle out there. 
In a global world market, what would 
ever make us think we don’t have to 
compete with these foreign companies? 
That is what this bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act does. 
It is widely talked about how there 
are 13 Republicans who voted for the 
bill. That is why we call it bipartisan. 
It means both Democrat and Repub-
lican. 
Some people say, wow, what a won-
der, how did you get 13 Republicans to 
vote for investing in America? Well, 
that is not the wonder. The wonder is 
what happened to the 200 Republicans 
who voted ‘‘no’’ on investing in Amer-
ica’s infrastructure and updating what 
the Greatest Generation passed down 
to us in making America as strong as 
ever. We can make it. What happened 
to these people that they voted ‘‘no’’ 
on that? 
These are the people who touted in-
frastructure week after infrastructure 
week after infrastructure week, and 
what did they do? They did nothing. It 
took the Biden administration to come 
along 
and 
a 
Democratic-controlled 
House to pass the thing. That is ex-
actly what we did, and what a wonder-
ful afternoon on the south lawn of the 
White House, where we all gathered, 
Democrats and Republicans who sup-
ported that bill. It got signed into law. 
You know who I was sitting near? I 
was sitting near the CEO of Amtrak 
and the president of Amtrak and the

December 1, 2021 
chairman of the board of Amtrak, and 
I talked a lot about the way other 
places in this country will benefit from 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, but I haven’t men-
tioned what will happen in north-
eastern Pennsylvania because it has to 
do with Amtrak. 
We have been struggling in north-
eastern Pennsylvania without train 
service for the last 51 years. It has been 
since the early 1970s since a passenger 
train rolled into Scranton, Pennsyl-
vania. We have been without train 
service for that long. If you don’t think 
that hurts an area, you are wrong. 
Here’s how we know. We got Amtrak 
interested in investigating a New York 
City to Scranton, across the top of New 
Jersey, across the Delaware River, into 
southern Monroe County at the Dela-
ware Water Gap, through Stroudsburg, 
up 
through 
Mount 
Pocono, 
past 
Tobyhanna, and up into Lackawanna 
County and Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
We got them interested in looking at 
that route, and they did. 
You know what they found, Madam 
Speaker? They found that this is ex-
actly the kind of route that Amtrak 
ought to be investing in. What we did 
was we showed them what we have to 
offer in northeastern Pennsylvania. We 
showed them all of the recreational op-
portunities there are, we showed them 
the wonderful hardworking workforce 
that we have, the people that have the 
kind of work ethic and pride in their 
work that goes an awful long way to-
ward 
creating 
successful 
manufac-
turing companies. 
We showed these things to people 
coming in from out of the area, and the 
Amtrak executives looked at this, and 
they said yes, this is the kind of line 
that makes sense. They examined it, 
and their specialists looked into it, and 
they worked out the economic activity 
increase that would result from such a 
new line. 
Three trains a day going back and 
forth between Scranton and along that 
line I discussed to New York City will 
result, according to Amtrak’s eco-
nomic analysis, in $87 million a year in 
additional economic activity each and 
every year those three trains are oper-
ating between New York City and 
Scranton. $87 million a year in eco-
nomic activity. 
They are not just pulling those fig-
ures out of the air, Madam Speaker. 
They know what they are talking 
about at Amtrak because they have 
done it before, and they have seen it 
happen. They put in about an 80-mile 
stretch from Boston northbound, and 
they saw it happen. They saw why it 
happens, because people want to do de-
velopment along the rail lines. Along 
those rail lines they have seen it time 
and time again, things pop up, fac-
tories pop up, office parks pop up, resi-
dential developments pop up. All of 
this means jobs, jobs, jobs, and more 
jobs. 
What we are interested in in north-
eastern Pennsylvania is not just a pret-
ty ride through the countryside on a 
train. What we are interested in is the 
jobs, because $87 million a year in eco-
nomic activity is an awful lot of jobs. 
These 
are 
just 
some 
examples, 
Madam Speaker, of what it means to 
have this infrastructure bill get passed 
into law and signed by the President. 
These are things that will happen. 
Maybe the greatest thing is that we 
look toward the future with that law. 
It is not just old-fashioned infrastruc-
ture. 
I mentioned before, the investment 
in broadband internet for every place 
in America, it is a model we have seen 
before. The government has done this 
before. Under the Roosevelt adminis-
tration it was called the Rural Elec-
trification Act, and the idea was there 
were some places in America that did 
not have electricity and should have 
electricity. Imagine living in a town 
that nobody can turn on an electric 
light at night. It was shocking and 
shameful, that kind of inequality in ac-
cess to new technology. 
But we beat that. The Roosevelt ad-
ministration pushed through the Rural 
Electrification Act, and every nook 
and cranny and every holler and every 
place that was off the beaten path 
ended up with electric service, and it 
was a wonderful thing. All of those peo-
ple who could have been left behind 
were not. They were brought along. 
b 1815 
It is the same thing with our invest-
ment in rural internet access. When I 
say ‘‘rural,’’ that is largely the type of 
place that is left behind. There are 
some urban areas that are internet 
starved, you might say, but by and 
large, it is mostly rural places that 
will benefit from this massive invest-
ment in broadband internet. 
Why is it important? Because it is 
the same thing. If you don’t have 
broadband 
internet 
in 
these 
rural 
places, these rural places get left be-
hind modern life every bit as much as 
they would have gotten left behind 80 
years ago without electricity. 
It means that kids studying in school 
aren’t left behind because they have 
access to the internet, and their par-
ents don’t have to drive them to a local 
fast-food place so they can sit in the 
parking lot and get online that way. 
That is ridiculous. 
Every place in America ought to 
have broadband internet. 
Now, about 65 percent of achieving 
that goal is done through the bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, and about 35 percent, fin-
ishing the job, is in the Build Back 
Better Act. We can do such a thing for 
our children and our grandchildren, but 
it is more than that, Madam Speaker, 
it is also for our businesses. 
Our businesses depend on the inter-
net as much as anybody else, as much 
as kids in school. They need to have ac-
cess to quick communications. If you 
have places that don’t have that ac-
cess, you know what that means. That 
means new businesses will not spring 
up in those places. Those places will be 
bypassed. They will be left behind. Why 
would a business want to start up a 
new enterprise in a place that does not 
have access to broadband internet? 
It really doesn’t take a rocket sci-
entist to figure these things out. If we 
want to give these kinds of economic 
advantages to this country, and we 
want to be inclusive of every place in 
this country, no matter who they are 
or who they worship or how they vote, 
it doesn’t matter. We have to come to-
gether as a country and realize that we 
are all in this together, and we need to 
provide broadband internet to every 
place in America every bit as much as 
we did that for basic electricity at the 
time we did that. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
tell you that we passed the bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act and that it was on the South Lawn 
of the White House that President 
Biden signed it into law. It is some-
thing that will redound to the benefit 
of our children and our grandchildren, 
and their children and their grand-
children. These are investments that 
will pay and pay generation after gen-
eration, and they will create millions 
and millions of jobs. 
We have already created 5.6 million 
jobs this year, but it doesn’t stop there. 
We are just getting started. Madam 
Speaker, the Democrats have delivered 
this Congress. I couldn’t be prouder. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNIZING GENEVA WILSON 
PERRYMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for 
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the legacy of 
public service of the late Geneva Wil-
son Perryman. 
Mrs. Geneva Wilson Perryman was 
known for her passion that she shared 
for making her community a better 
place for all. 
Mrs. Wilson Perryman raised her five 
children in Detroit alongside her hus-
band, Alex, to whom she had been mar-
ried for 77 years. 
Geneva was well known in her neigh-
borhood for welcoming those in need to 
share a warm meal. 
Mrs. Wilson Perryman was a teacher 
for nearly 40 years in our community 
and had received numerous awards and 
a number of acknowledgments for her 
excellence in education and her hands- 
on actions in working to secure equal 
justice for all in our city of Detroit. 
Mrs. 
Wilson 
Perryman 
was 
out-
spoken. She was a feisty woman, as 
some say, and made it her mission to 
speak truth to power. 
Please join me in recognizing the 
late Geneva Wilson Perryman and her

RECOGNIZING CONGRESSIONAL APP COMPETITION 
WINNERS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Michigan’s 13th 
District Congressional App Competi-
tion winners, Hope of Detroit Acad-
emy’s Green Warriors. 
Under the guidance of their teacher, 
Ms. Allie Langwald, students Abraham 
Salas, Yaritza Campos, and Itzel Mar-
tinez worked diligently to find innova-
tive solutions to address issues in their 
neighborhood in the southwest Detroit 
community. 
Their hard work helped create the 
Green Warrior app, which utilizes tech-
nology to help residents quickly and 
easily report illegal dumping sites in 
need of cleanup and expose dangerous 
buildings. 
In partnership, the students and their 
teacher worked with the city of Detroit 
and other community-based organiza-
tions. Their app will now ensure that 
neighborhood streets and parks are 
cleaned up, and dangerous buildings 
are boarded up, so the community can 
enjoy the use of public spaces. 
Again, please join me in congratu-
lating the Congressional App Competi-
tion winners, Hope of Detroit’s Green 
Warriors, for their hard work on behalf 
of the communities of Detroit, Wayne 
County, and Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN POLITICS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today during the United 
Nations’ 16 Days of Activism Against 
Gender-Based Violence to call out the 
disturbing rise of violence against 
women in politics here in the United 
States. 
As we know, the never-ending string 
of ignorant, hateful, and downright 
threatening rhetoric against my sisters 
in service and I and many is unaccept-
able, especially the deeply hateful, 
Islamophobic comments from a Mem-
ber of this body against Congress-
woman OMAR and the straight-up death 
threat against Congresswoman OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, as well as our sitting Presi-
dent. 
The hate these Members spew at 
every opportunity is not new. It is the 
same hate that is directed against 
countless women all around the globe 
and especially women of color in poli-
tics who are right now breaking down 
barriers and trying to represent and 
serve their communities. 
By failing to put our party dif-
ferences aside and denounce violence 
and hate, I want to encourage, again, 
my colleagues to continue to speak up. 
During the United Nations’ 16 Days 
of Activism Against Gender-Based Vio-
lence, I am asking folks to truly be 
able to speak up, stand up, and advo-
cate for us to do better. 
To that end, I am proud to have 
joined Congresswomen BUSH, OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, OMAR, PRESSLEY, and SPEIER 
to introduce H. Res. 801, which de-
nounces violence against women in pol-
itics in all its forms. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

INFORMATION—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–77) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I am pleased to transmit to the Con-
gress, pursuant to section 123 d. of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 2153(d)), the text of an Agree-
ment between the Government of the 
United States of America, the Govern-
ment of Australia, and the Government 
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland (the ‘‘United 
Kingdom’’) for the Exchange of Naval 
Nuclear Propulsion Information (the 
‘‘Agreement’’). I am also pleased to 
transmit my written approval, author-
ization, and determination concerning 
the Agreement. The memorandum sub-
mitted to me by the Secretary of En-
ergy providing a summary position on 
the Agreement is also enclosed. 
Pursuant to the enhanced trilateral 
security partnership called ‘‘AUKUS’’ 
announced earlier this year, our three 
governments are engaging in an 18- 
month consultation period to seek an 
optimal pathway for delivery of nu-
clear-powered 
submarines 
for 
the 
Royal Australian Navy at the earliest 
achievable date. The Agreement would 
permit the three Parties to commu-
nicate and exchange Naval Nuclear 
Propulsion Information and would pro-
vide authorization to share certain Re-
stricted Data as may be needed during 
trilateral discussions, thereby enabling 
full and effective consultations. 
In my judgment, the Agreement 
meets all statutory requirements. 
I have determined that the United 
Kingdom and Australia, by partici-
pating with the United States pursuant 
to 
international 
arrangements, 
are 
making substantial and material con-
tributions to the mutual defense and 
security. The United Kingdom is party 
to the North Atlantic Treaty, and Aus-
tralia is party to the Australia, New 
Zealand, and United States Security 
Treaty. 
I have approved the Agreement, au-
thorized its execution, and urge that 
the Congress give it favorable consider-
ation.

REVIEWING THE FISCAL PICTURE 
OF AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
tonight we are going to try to do sort 
an of an extension of the last couple of 
times I have been behind this micro-
phone and have a discussion about 
what is actually going on with the big 
fiscal picture of our country. 
I am going to be a little mean to 
some of the Democratic policies, but I 
am going to show factually how I think 
it actually hurts, but there is actually 
something that happened this last 
week that we should actually be al-
most giddy about if it ultimately 
proves out, a major breakthrough on 
one of the things that creates misery 
around the world, let alone our own 
country, but also has real fiscal im-
pacts. 
So, let’s actually sort of start with 
some of the basics. How much do you 
think we borrowed every single day 
last year? We were playing with the 
math a little while ago. We were bor-
rowing about $3.8 billion every single 
day. Break that down, do that math, an 
it is $160 million an hour. 
I know every time I get behind this 
mic and start talking numbers, people 
just glaze over, but it is important be-
cause if you are someone who says I 
really care about investments in the 
environment, I really care about in-
vestments in healthcare, I really care 
about investments in education, where 
do you think the money is going to 
come from? 
If we continue policywise the avoid-
ance of the drivers of our debt, we con-
tinue doing public policy by feelings. 
One of the things that enrages me 
around here is we have entire conversa-
tions, entire speeches behind these 
microphones, and then we make public 
policy by our emotions, by our feelings, 
but not by a calculator. 
b 1830 
And I know the calculator sounds 
cold, and as Republicans, we sound like 
accountants on steroids, but at some 
point the math is important. But also, 
what happens when I can show you 
that getting the math right means you 
don’t hurt people? 
We saw in the Democrat social spend-
ing bill, their Build Back Better, mul-
tiple university papers coming out say-
ing, Hey, we are looking at this and we 
believe the working poor will be poorer 
at the end of the decade. The disasso-
ciation of the value of your labors to 
money coming in, the other social poli-
cies that were driven in that piece of 
legislation, they may be great politics,

and they are really crappy for the soci-
ety, and they are really crappy for the 
very people that the left claims they 
care about. 
So let’s pull it back and just deal 
with where we are at right now. Now, 
this board here is from math from a 
year ago. And once again, we are not 
going to talk about 1965, but I start 
with this over and over because I can’t 
tell you how many people will come up 
to me at Costco, and they will walk up 
and say, DAVID, if you would just cut 
back on that foreign aid. DAVID, if you 
would just get rid of waste and fraud. 
Or if they are liberals, Hey, if you cut 
back on defense spending. 
Well, we have a reality problem. You 
see this red area? That is mandatory 
spending. That is functionally, Social 
Security, Medicare—the primary driv-
ers. 
The green area over here is what we 
get to vote on. The little blue area, 
that is defense. The green is all domes-
tic. It is down to 13 percent of what we, 
as Members of Congress, vote on is the 
non-defense spending around here. And 
that is today. This gets dramatically 
worse. And you know what makes it 
worse? We are getting old as a society. 
Demographics. Demographics are ac-
tually what primarily drive the U.S. 
sovereign debt. And yet, how many 
times—for anyone that is crazy enough 
to watch C–SPAN, or even our fellow 
Members or staff—do we talk about 
where we are going to be in just a few 
years. 
And I thought I would also just sort 
of start with some of the folklore. You 
will hear the speeches here of: Rich 
people need to pay their fair share. 
They sure do. 
A couple months ago we made a 
whole presentation here on the floor 
begging our Democrat colleagues, say-
ing instead of doing policy where you 
are going to go—say, we are going to 
raise taxes on small businesses. We are 
going to go raise taxes on individuals. 
How about just stop subsidizing them? 
We came in and showed almost $1.4 
trillion over 10 years that the policies 
of this place subsidize the rich. And I 
am talking the really rich. So the 
Democrats did their build back better 
social spending bill. If you look at it, it 
now substantially subsidizes the really 
rich even more. 
The other perversity in that piece of 
legislation, if you get to year five, you 
do realize you have driven almost an-
other $800 billion of borrowing. Then 
we play this pretend game around here 
and say, Oh, then we are going to make 
these programs disappear, and then we 
are going to keep the taxes going for 
the rest of the decade. And that is how 
we only end up with about $400 billion 
of borrowing. 
I mean, no wonder those in the public 
who pay attention to Congress in 
Washington, D.C., just realize we treat 
the public like fools. These are people 
who are just trying to survive. They 
are trying to take care of their kids. 
They are trying to get ready for retire-
ment. And this place is basically get-
ting ready to destroy the next couple 
decades. And the scale of debt is off the 
charts and it will drive every bit of pol-
icy around here, instead of the fraud 
that is going on so far this year where 
it looks more like trying to buy votes 
than save the future of this country. 
So let’s take a quick look. Even 100 
percent tax rate on small businesses 
and upper-income families, if you took 
100 percent of it, you can’t get close to 
covering where we are spending-wise. It 
is just math. And I know this is a 
math-free zone, but at some point the 
math will always win. 
So take a look here. If you took 
every dime of people that make over 
$500,000, and with that, every dime of 
the small business earnings, you get 
about 5.5 percent of GDP. This is the 
most elegant way to do the math. But 
in 2030, just the borrowing will be 6.3 
percent of GDP. And 29 years from now, 
it is 15.1. You don’t get close to it. You 
can take every dime of $500,000 and up 
and every dime from small business, 
and where are we 29 years from now? 
You hit a third of the revenues nec-
essary. 
We are living in just an absolute eco-
nomic fraud. The share of Federal tax 
revenue spent on interest—and this is 
one of those that scares me to death. 
Let’s see if I can try to explain this. 
What happens to a country when you 
have borrowed and borrowed and bor-
rowed and borrowed and borrowed, and 
you put yourself right up against the 
edge. And then you have a new virus 
and all of a sudden you need to sta-
bilize the economy. Or God forbid, 
there is a military conflict or some 
other tragedy in your country, you 
have made yourself very, very fragile 
as a country. 
It is the concept of, we all have this 
occasion where we live a little too 
close to the fire and that one time 
there is a traffic accident, that one 
time something happens and we miss 
our airplane. We understand the con-
sequences of what they call fragility. 
We are doing that to this country. 
This board here is really simple. If we 
had a 2 percent increase in interest 
rates, by the time we get to that 29 
years from now, 100 percent of all the 
tax revenues, 100 percent of the tax 
revenues go just to pay the interest 
payments. You start to think about 
that, hell, just a 1 percent rise in inter-
est from the CBO’s baseline is 70 per-
cent of all tax revenues will be con-
sumed just making our interest pay-
ments. 
Is this the future you plan for your 
children? I mean, is this the future this 
place plans for your own retirement? 
You think you are going to continue to 
still get all the benefits you have 
earned when your government, 100 per-
cent of its income is going just to cover 
the borrowing interest? This is where 
we are at. And this is last year’s math. 
This is before the huge amount of bor-
rowing that has already happened this 
year. 
So now the most difficult part of 
when you get behind this conversation, 
for those who come behind these micro-
phones, this is the part that my broth-
ers and sisters around here on the 
left—and even a number on the right— 
don’t want to have. 
What is the primary driver of the 
U.S. sovereign debt? Two things: Re-
member how I said demographics? It is 
the fact we are getting older. You have 
got to understand, 29 years from now— 
and this was actually, this math was 
done before the massive amount of 
spending this last year—we will be at 
$112 trillion of borrowed money in 29 
years. And that is inflation-adjusted, 
so today’s dollars, $112 trillion of bor-
rowed money, most of it is Medicare. 
If you are like I am, and you believe 
Medicare is a societal promise we 
made, how do you plan to keep paying 
for it? Social Security is the rest of the 
balance. The rest of the budget is actu-
ally in balance. As a matter of fact, the 
latest math actually says the rest of 
the budget actually has a small posi-
tive balance in 29, 30 years. 
How many times today behind my 
Democratic microphones—or even the 
Republican microphones—did we tell 
the public the truth? That if we don’t 
get our act together and find a way to 
disrupt the cost of healthcare, we have 
just—and it is a technical economic 
term for the future—we have screwed 
our kids and our own retirements. I am 
sorry to be crass, but I don’t know how 
to get anyone here to listen. 
It is math. It is demographics. It is 
not Republican or Democrats. Getting 
older is not Republican or Democrat. It 
is not partisan. It is math. 
And the solution so far this year is, 
Well, let’s just spend a hell of a lot 
more money right now, let’s pay for it 
with a bunch of fake accounting. And 
maybe it is enough spending where we 
can buy enough votes, we will survive 
another election, but the country will 
be in an incredible amount of trouble. 
So what is the solution? Well, let’s 
first, what is the primary driver? You 
just saw the slide. The primary driver 
of U.S. sovereign debt is Medicare. 
So let’s break it down. Five percent 
of our Nation’s population, our broth-
ers and sisters who have really tough 
lives—they have chronic conditions, 
they have diabetes, they will have 
other comorbidities, as you have heard 
over and over during the pandemic— 
well, they are a majority of our 
healthcare spending. If you actually 
love and care for people, why not go 
and do your very best to help these 
poor people that are suffering? Oh, by 
the way, you also get an amazing eco-
nomic value for it. 
Go help our brothers and sisters who 
are sick, who are suffering. It is not 
putting up a bunch more clinics. It is 
investing 
in 
the 
disruptive 
tech-
nologies that are around us right now 
that are curing people. 
I beg this place to think like 
disruptors. Because good politics are, 
Oh, we are going to go spend a bunch of

money; we are going to put up a bunch 
more diabetes clinics in my district, 
and I will look like a hero. Yeah, 
maybe that is great politics, but you 
just functionally patched over the mis-
ery, the suffering. Go put the resources 
in a cure. 
I did a presentation back in March or 
April here, talking about a cure for 
Type 1 diabetes and how it also means 
part of that will translate to Type 2. I 
saved some of the really nasty emails I 
got saying, Oh, that isn’t true; it can’t 
happen. 
Wait until the last board here. Guess 
what? There are miracles happening 
around us. Do you remember a couple 
weeks here I did a little presentation 
on messenger RNA? We now have a 
vaccine. 
Now, it is not 100 percent effective. It 
is only mildly effective. It has to be 
used for malaria. It looks like we are 
about to have a vaccine for so many 
other diseases that plague us. Why 
aren’t we putting our resources into 
something of that nature? Because if it 
is 5 percent of our brothers and sisters 
who are suffering, who are the major-
ity of our healthcare spending—and 
healthcare spending is what is bank-
rupting the country—putting up a 
bunch more clinics doesn’t solve the 
problem. 
Also the other absurdity, I will have 
liberal friends who will say, Well, we 
did the ACA, known as Obamacare. 
That was a financing bill. It basically 
just moved around who got subsidized 
and who had to pay. It didn’t change 
the price of healthcare. And I hate to 
say, the Republican alternative did the 
same thing. We just moved around who 
got subsidized, who had to pay. I think 
we did some more things to create 
some creativity and competitiveness, 
but that bill died in the Senate. We did 
pass it out of the House. 
But then you will get some that say, 
Well, how about Medicare for all. Medi-
care for all doesn’t save a dime. Model 
after model after model says it doesn’t 
save a dime unless you begin ration-
ing—and even then it really doesn’t 
save much. 
So what do you do? What are the ac-
tual drivers? 
You remember that Medicare number 
that is the primary driver of our debt? 
Remember on that chart, it was $77 
trillion over the next 29 years. And 
after this year’s binge spending, God 
knows what the new numbers are. Thir-
ty-one percent of Medicare spending is 
just diabetes, so almost a third of over-
all healthcare spending is just diabetes. 
Take a step and think about it. For 
someone like myself, who is terrified of 
that failed bond auction because we 
have built up so much more debt, and 
the public—and internationally—they 
just don’t have an appetite for our debt 
anymore, that becomes the cascade of 
hell. 
b 1845 
If I came to you, and said, Why don’t 
we focus on how to help people not 
have such misery, and also it would 
have incredible effects on our fiscal sit-
uation. 
Madam Speaker, 31 percent of just 
Medicare is diabetes. So why aren’t we 
doing something like an operation 
warp speed on diabetes, instead of so-
cial spending where we can buy an-
other election with taxpayers’ money 
and then borrow and borrow and bor-
row, and then use absolute fraud as the 
pretense of how it is going to be paid 
for? Or we could do something where 
we end people’s misery, and the future 
looks brighter and optimistic. 
This slide here, I think I brought to 
the floor in April, and I did a whole lit-
tle thing about the concept of the tech-
nology being developed, and it is really 
impressive. They have worked on it for 
years, taking stem cells and adjusting 
the DNA there to make it—and forgive 
me if I mispronounce these things—an 
islet cell and their ability to produce 
insulin. 
I showed this slide—and I still have a 
few of those emails of folks saying, 
Stop making things up. This tech-
nology can’t work. You can’t cure dia-
betes. Well, a couple great articles this 
weekend—and this is where the opti-
mism is. This is a place of optimism. 
We live in an amazing country. We 
have suffered and done great things, 
and yet we seem to roll in misery these 
days instead of the fact that we are on 
the cusp of ending so many individuals’ 
misery, sickness, and maybe even 
changing the world. 
I only did this just so people could 
visualize. Imagine the concept of grab-
bing some stem cells. You can grab 
them now from skin—we have learned 
all sorts of things. The ability to pro-
gram them, and then functionally you 
can teach them to grow into what you 
need. 
If we have that technology, just 
imagine the diseases, the illnesses, the 
misery—so you have messenger RNA 
that now we are about to know how to 
take on so many viruses, so many 
other types of diseases. We are now 
about to have the technology—we actu-
ally now do have the technology—to 
actually take on other types of dis-
eases where it is failures of certain or-
gans. 
Now, I am going to give you one 
other one, just as part of the thought 
experiment, before we do the closing 
board that I am most excited about. 
If Congress wanted to have an impact 
on healthcare costs, what is something 
we could do in 1 year? What is some-
thing we could do—Republicans and 
Democrats could do in 1 year? If I came 
to you right now, and said, In 1 year, 
you are not going to get all of it, but 16 
percent of healthcare spending turns 
out to be people not taking their phar-
maceuticals as they should. You realize 
that is well over a half a trillion dol-
lars a year. 
A half a trillion dollars a year in 
spending because someone didn’t take 
their high blood pressure pill and they 
have their stroke. They had trouble 
and they didn’t take their insulin; they 
didn’t do this and that. What if I came 
to you right now, and said, Instead of 
nationalizing healthcare and doing this 
and that, why don’t we promote sub-
sidized—make it part of CMS—the 
technology where the pill bottle cap 
beeps at grandma when she didn’t take 
her meds? 
For someone like myself with high 
blood pressure—I take my pill reli-
giously—but if I didn’t, my phone 
would beep at me, and say: David, we 
don’t want you to have a stroke. Please 
take your medicine because we know it 
works. We know the same thing. How 
many people do we know who have had 
clogged arteries, and if they had just 
taken their statins? 
Madam Speaker, 16 percent of all 
healthcare spending relates back to 
people not taking their meds. That is 
$528 billion a year. 
There are disruptions. If you take 
that and then put it into what we al-
ready know about the messenger RNA 
and the fact that there are so many ill-
nesses and diseases—if you read any-
thing, you have to have seen the arti-
cles that believe that we are close to a 
vaccine for HIV, close to a vaccine for 
herpes. Now you see the vaccine out 
there for malaria. There are so many 
amazing things happening, you saw it 
two boards back. 
When I came to this mike back last 
March and we talked about, Hey, there 
is maybe this stem cell therapy that is 
going to turn how to make islet cells 
that actually could be injected back 
into someone, and it could be at least 
the cure for type 1 diabetes. 
How many of you saw the articles 
this weekend? It was only one person; 
it was the first person they tried it on. 
Guess what? It works. They have suc-
cessfully cured someone with type 1 di-
abetes. That is a million and a half of 
our brothers and sisters in this Nation. 
What are we willing to do to find a 
way to almost put that type of tech-
nology—let’s have it be proofed. Are we 
willing to put it on a production line, 
just like we have done, messenger RNA 
on a production line? And now can we 
also make the really tough policy deci-
sions, are we willing to change the 
farm bill, nutrition, some of the inputs 
into type 2 diabetes? And if we can fix 
those, the articles and papers are say-
ing the same ability to fix the body’s 
ability to make insulin again may be a 
path to cure type 2 diabetes. If that is 
true, think about it. 
You just saw, the primary driver of 
U.S. sovereign debt is healthcare costs, 
Medicare. 
Madam Speaker, 31 percent of Medi-
care spending is just diabetes. Why 
wouldn’t this place take on something 
that is that obvious, that is loving and 
compassionate, and also really makes a 
big difference to our future, both eco-
nomically and just from a moral health 
standpoint of loving and caring for our 
brothers and sisters? 
The last thing I will throw out—we 
are working on a little project in my

office and the math is really hard. If 
you care about things like income in-
equality and you look at the differen-
tials of our brothers and sisters, like 
Tribal communities out West, other 
people that may have urban minority 
communities that are suffering from 
type 2 diabetes, we are trying to figure 
out what would the math look like if 
those populations had this disease 
cured? 
What would their economics be? 
Would we actually see so many others 
able to come back into society, back 
into the economy, back into trying to 
develop a life in the middle class? 
The crazy thing is our preliminary 
math—it may turn out that curing a 
big portion of our population where we 
see the huge income inequality and 
helping them get back into society and 
the economy may be one of the most 
powerful things, if not maybe the sin-
gle largest thing, we could do to actu-
ally take on income inequality in this 
country. 
Who would have ever thought? It is 
the math. I want to make the argu-
ment that people here who want to 
make policy by their feelings are 
crushing individuals, crushing families, 
crushing the country. People are will-
ing to see love and compassion through 
actual facts or how we do what is 
moral and do what is right and also do 
what makes this country as great as 
can be. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me take this opportunity to do one 
or two things. First, I acknowledge my 
colleague, Congresswoman SLOTKIN and 
her district, to offer to her and the peo-
ple of Michigan my deepest concern 
and sympathy for the loss of those pre-
cious children. 
No parent should ever expect to send 
their child to school and there would 
be a loss of life. Murdered. And for too 
long we have had a roll call of children 
being 
murdered. 
Students 
at 
Col-
umbine High School, those college stu-
dents at Virginia Tech, high school 
students at Parkland, high school stu-
dents at Santa Fe, and of course, in 
Connecticut, little babies. It brought a 
President to tears. 
Tonight, my message is sometimes 
the Federal Government has to step in. 
For example, as it relates to this 
tragedy of gun violence, we are long 
overdue for dealing with the appro-
priate reaction. Many of us have dis-
cussed legislation that I had, some 20- 
plus years ago in Texas, that some-
times—although I am a champion of 
parents, I am one—I want to see par-
ents front and center in their chil-
dren’s education, PTO meetings, I 
know where to go to get action par-
ents. 
When a little one—and I will say a 
little one—gets a gun from a parent 
that bought the gun a few days ago and 
winds up taking the lives of three pre-
cious little ones and others now fight-
ing for their lives in hospitals, I would 
make the argument that something 
has to be done. Something has to be 
done and the Federal Government 
needs to step in in a tragedy like this. 
We will all be working with our col-
leagues to do better. Before I start this 
theme that I have, as a member of the 
Judiciary Committee now for two dec-
ades, I have seen the success stories of 
making things better. I remember the 
joy of the reauthorization of the Vot-
ing Rights Act in 2007 and 2008 when we 
went as a bipartisan Congress—98 votes 
in the United States Senate and 400 
plus in the House, and the bill was 
signed by George W. Bush. The Voting 
Rights bill, the one that is now being 
held hostage. 
That is something that the Federal 
Government does better—voting rights. 
That is what I want to talk about to-
night, what we need to do better. 
Just a moment, before I do that, let 
me deviate just for a moment and let 
me do it because I am pained. I am 
hurt. This has not been directed at me, 
but a sister Congresswoman. 
b 1900 
This has not been directed at me, but 
a sister Congresswoman. And when I 
say sister Congresswoman, I am look-
ing at the landscape of women because 
it has not been easy for women, Madam 
Speaker, to get to the United States 
Congress. We have not been here long 
in large numbers. We have been one or 
two. We can go back to the 1800s and 
beyond to know that women did come 
into the United States Congress but 
very few—certainly women of color, 
very few. 
Then might I add something else, 
Madam Speaker, the wonderfulness of 
the multiculturalism of faith, the dif-
ferent faiths that are in this place. It is 
finally a recognition of America as the 
unusual 
experiment, 
different 
lan-
guages and different cultures under one 
flag that you sit directly in front of, 
Madam Speaker, the United States of 
America. And then as I stand here 
right above your head, Madam Speak-
er, it says, In God We Trust. 
So whatever way you craft your 
faith, our Constitution says that you 
are recognized and welcome under the 
First Amendment, freedom of religion 
and freedom of access. That is one of 
the reasons that, although imperfect, 
America has been able to go into far-
away places and find connection be-
cause they have citizens who are con-
nected to those places. 
Then why would we have the trash of 
discourse? 
Why would we disgrace our positions 
and the oath we take by suggesting 
that a person of a different faith, who 
wears her own faith, a hijab, is a ter-
rorist? 
Madam Speaker, there were times 
when I first began to wear braids that 
I was looked at askance. I, frankly, be-
lieve there are opportunities that I did 
not get because I wore braids. But it 
does not in any way even equal to 
being called a terrorist or black heart, 
to be made light of, to have a faith 
made light of, to not understand that 
the words in this hallowed ground, this 
most powerful lawmaking body in the 
world, is heard around the world. 
As we speak today, someone is won-
dering what Americans are saying. The 
easy way to do it is to tune in, as we 
may not think, to the floor of the 
House; or the aftermath the words of a 
Member of Congress or a Member of the 
United States Senate or the President 
carry great weight, make a lot of noise, 
and are listened to. And the billions of 
Muslims around the world should not 
be denigrated for tomfoolery. 
But what about, as I have been told, 
our own Member, ILHAN OMAR, receiv-
ing deaths because of someone’s ugly 
words? 
It is time for the Federal Govern-
ment to step in. Lives can be lost. Or 
we used to have that old phrase, sticks 
and stones can break my bones, but 
words will never hurt me. And that is 
the context of yesteryear when the 
words were, in essence, light. 
But, Madam Speaker, when you begin 
to play with the minds of those who 
came on January 6, we just heard testi-
mony that said: I came because the 
former President called me to come. 
Then who is safe when we say words? 
This is not chatter. It is vile, and it 
can hurt people. 
Can it hurt the innocent Muslim 
woman on a street in America, or Mus-
lim man, or Muslim family, or Muslim 
child going to school because it has a 
megaphone? 
Can it endanger our colleagues no 
matter who they are? 
It is appropriate for the action of this 
House or the time for the Federal Gov-
ernment to step in. 
I offer my concern, love, and affec-
tion for my colleagues and my sister 
Congresswomen. But I cannot and we 
should not tolerate dastardly language 
and non-humorous insults and threats 
to people’s lives. 
How dare you? 
As I said, I want to talk about the 
idea of when the Federal Government 
should come into action. 
Madam Speaker, let me ask you how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 20 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
the Federal Government is an umbrella 
on a rainy day. So the context of my 
remarks today will be about criminal 
justice issues and the unequal results 
that have come about through State 
laws. 
Let me say that the juries have spo-
ken in two important cases. As a 
trained lawyer I will say it again: The 
jury has spoken. But it does not mean

December 1, 2021 
that I have to accept in one instance 
the ultimate decision based upon the 
context of that trial and all of the 
trappings: The judge, the prosecutors, 
the defense, and the law. 
So let me begin very briefly. 
What is self-defense? 
It is a legal justification for the oth-
erwise illegal use of force. You have 
killed someone in most instances. In 
the instance of self-defense that results 
in a death, although an unlawful kill-
ing did occur, it is considered a justi-
fied killing. 
Do you know how many lives are 
lost, particularly people of color, by 
being defined as a justified killing? 
To succeed on self-defense grounds, 
an unprovoked attack, the killer was 
not the aggressor, the killer reasonably 
believed that they were in imminent 
danger, the use of force was reasonable. 
This duty also requires the individual 
claiming self-defense to retreat prior 
to using deadly force. 
In the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse’s be-
havior, two men are dead, and they 
have families. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36; 
Anthony Huber, 26. Their families are 
hurting. And then one was drastically 
injured; Gaige Grosskreutz was dras-
tically injured. And yet we find the 
self-defense law was used for the al-
leged 
interpretation 
of 
justifiable 
homicide. 
Shameful. The law needs to be re-
viewed. 
Someone said: Was he not even guilty 
of a traffic ticket? 
Could you frame the case, Madam 
Speaker, in a young person who left 
their home and secured an AK–47? 
The representation is that I came to 
protect. 
Then why wasn’t the question asked 
to the young man: Did you not land in 
the midst of protests? 
Did you not head directly to where 
the police were? 
Or did you surround yourself where 
protesters under the First Amendment 
had a right in this instance to be angry 
and agitated but nonviolent? 
They were unarmed. 
So if your reasoning was to go to pro-
tect, then go to the protectors. That 
was not the case. This was a false nar-
rative ill-conceived. And although 17 or 
18, he had the wherewithal and should 
have been held accountable for not 
going to where he said he was going to 
go. 
The 
prosecutor 
in 
the 
Ahmaud 
Arbery case had it right. You can’t 
come to provoke and then declare self- 
defense. That is what happened in the 
Rittenhouse case. Tragedy of the kill-
ing—of the shooting of Jacob Blake; 
those there were agitated, some might 
say rightly so. Some were there to do 
other things. 
But the real issue was: Did they de-
serve to die? 
Was this gentleman anywhere near 
police? 
No. He came to provoke and then 
claimed self-defense. I believe there 
should be a Federal review of self-de-
fense laws across America, and I will 
share with you why: Because Anthony 
Huber is dead, because Joseph Rosen-
baum is dead, and because Gaige is se-
verely injured. 
But yet this is supposed to be the pic-
ture of someone who only came to help. 
He didn’t get to the party of police 
that were down the street technically. 
He didn’t make a beeline—as some of 
our parents would say, make a beeline 
for home. He didn’t make a beeline to 
get to right where the police were and 
get instructions from the police. He 
was in the midst of those who right-
fully could be protesting with some dis-
pute as to what they might have been 
doing, but that was the charge of law 
enforcement. To my knowledge, that 
night law enforcement did not kill any-
one, and ultimately the protesters left 
the area. 
Self-defense 
laws 
across 
America 
need to be reviewed because too many 
people are dying under this false 
premise that everybody can use self-de-
fense. 
What about the castle doctrine? 
That is an expansion of self-defense 
both statutory and common law, in 
which removes the duty to retreat for 
self-defense on individuals inside their 
home. This principle has been codified 
and expanded by the majority of State 
legislatures in a variety of ways. How-
ever, the boyfriend of Breonna Taylor 
who was defending her and the home 
was arrested, an African American. 
These laws need to be reviewed. They 
are State laws, but they are unequally 
applied. Enough is enough. 
Stand your ground laws. Stand your 
ground laws are an extension of the 
castle doctrine to areas outside of an 
individual’s home such that there is no 
duty to retreat for self-defense. The 
name is derived from statutory lan-
guage found in several States. 
This results in the imbalance, if you 
will, of justice. Racial disparities are 
much larger as White on Black homi-
cides have justifiable findings; 33 per-
centage points more often than Black 
on White homicides. So as Whites—as 
the father and son thought that they 
could kill Ahmaud Arbery, they were 
hoping for the odds that they would be 
found not guilty because they killed a 
Black man and they claimed self-de-
fense. 
Stand your ground laws appear to ex-
acerbate those differences as cases 
overall are significantly more likely to 
be ruled justified in stand your ground 
States than non-stand your ground 
States. We will talk about one of the 
most notorious cases. 
With respect to race controlling for 
all other attributes, the odds a White- 
on-Black homicide is found justified in 
281 percent greater than the odds of a 
White-on-White homicide is found jus-
tified. So if you happen to be White and 
kill a Black person, 281 percent of the 
time you are innocent. You are inno-
cent. By contrast, a Black-on-White 
homicide has barely half the odds of 
being 
ruled 
justifiable 
relative 
to 
White on White homicides. 
Let me be very clear. I want all lives 
to be saved. I want Black lives to be 
noticed and known and matter. I want 
to make sure that the justice system is 
fair. Justice should have no color. The 
scales of justice, Lady Justice, that is 
what the Judiciary Committee has 
been advocating and working for the 
decades that I have had the privilege of 
serving. 
Statistically Black-on-Black homi-
cides have the same odds of being ruled 
justifiable as White-on-White. White 
men are more likely to successfully in-
voke the use of stand your ground laws 
for their defense after shooting than 
Black Americans or women, especially 
Black women. 
Nationally the likelihood of a homi-
cide being ruled justified is 281 percent 
greater than when the defendant is 
White and the victim is Black. 
Need for Federal intervention and re-
view. In contrast, the likelihood of a 
homicide being ruled justified when the 
defendant is Black and the victim is 
White is 49 percent lower compared to 
cases where both the defendant and 
victim are White. 
In 68 percent, according to the Coali-
tion to Stop Gun Violence, of success-
ful stand your ground law claims in 
Florida, the person was unarmed. 
Let me quickly move to these cases. 
b 1915 
As I do so, let me add to my discus-
sion, and that is the citizen’s arrest, 
the citizen’s arrest law that was used 
by the defendants in the Ahmaud 
Arbery case. 
And let me offer my sympathy to 
those killed by Mr. Rittenhouse and to 
the family of Mr. Arbery. Let me give 
sympathy to the families of Joseph 
Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber be-
cause their loved ones are dead. 
But in this case of, one has always 
said, a praying mother, a praying fam-
ily, the citizen’s arrest law cited in 
Arbery’s case dates back to the Civil 
War. This case that was used, as the 
prosecutor indicated, was a Civil War- 
era State law to justify the killing. 
Since 1863, Georgia has allowed its 
residents to arrest one another if they 
witnessed a crime and the police were 
not around. Similar laws have existed 
in nearly every State. 
The citizen’s arrest laws in Georgia 
in 1863 were utilized on the pretense of 
getting freed slaves. They were free. 
But by their color, there were those 
who said: You are not free. I am arrest-
ing you. You are violating the law. You 
escaped. 
How horrible to have this kind of 
bounty. 
I include in the RECORD an article

coastal Georgia, a prosecutor cited a Civil 
War era state law to justify the killing. 
The same law was invoked last year in sub-
urban Atlanta after a white woman chased 
down a black man who left the scene of a car 
accident and killed him after starting a con-
frontation. 
Since 1863, Georgia has allowed its resi-
dents to arrest one another—if they have 
witnessed a crime and the police are not 
around. Similar laws exist in nearly every 
state, and have been raised in courtrooms 
over the decades to account for actions in a 
range of criminal cases, including assaults 
and murders. 
But after Mr. Arbery’s death, a growing 
chorus of critics are calling for the laws to 
be repealed. They say the laws are outdated, 
relics of the Wild West, and are ripe for 
abuse by untrained civilians in an age in 
which 911 is widely available and police re-
sponse times are generally within minutes. 
Like ‘‘stand your ground’’ and ‘‘castle doc-
trine’’ laws that allow people to use force to 
protect themselves or their homes—as in the 
case of a neighborhood watch volunteer in 
Florida who shot to death Trayvon Martin in 
2012—citizen’s arrest statutes have generated 
considerable controversy and cries of racism. 
‘‘Namely, a member of the public doesn’t 
know—and likely cannot understand—the 
nuances of citizen’s arrest, particularly when 
it comes to the use of deadly force,’’ Ira P. 
Robbins, a law professor at American Uni-
versity who wrote an academic paper on the 
issue, wrote in an email. 
‘‘That’s why it is so dangerous for people 
to take the law into their own hands.’’ 
Citizen’s arrest laws date back to medieval 
times. Absent an organized police force, in 
the late 1200s, King Edward I needed help 
fighting crime. The legal concept carried 
over to the United States, when in the coun-
try’s modern infancy, it could take days for 
a law enforcement agent to travel to a crime 
scene. 
The use of the law, while not altogether 
common, is generally less problematic in its 
more frequent use by shopkeepers detaining 
shoplifting suspects, for example, or by 
trained security guards and police officers 
operating outside their jurisdiction, Mr. 
Robbins wrote. 
Supporters of the law point to instances in 
which people who are committing crimes are 
thwarted and then held until the police ar-
rive, such as muggers or shoplifters. They 
are relied upon by crime watch groups like 
the Guardian Angels to anti-immigrant pa-
trols on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Still, Dana Mulhauser, a former civil 
rights lawyer at the Department of Justice 
who now runs the conviction integrity unit 
in St. Louis County, said citizen’s arrest 
laws had outlived themselves. 
‘‘These laws were created in a different 
time,’’ she said. ‘‘We are not in a time where 
we are lacking in police responsiveness in 
this country. You are asking for situations 
that cause trouble.’’ 
In the case in suburban Atlanta, Hannah R. 
Payne, 22, is awaiting trial on murder 
charges for the shooting death of Kenneth E. 
Herring, a 62-year-old mechanic who left the 
scene of a fender bender last May. Ms. 
Payne, who was not involved in the crash, 
chased Mr. Herring in her Jeep. 
Witnesses told police in Clayton County, 
Ga., that Ms. Payne blocked Mr. Herring’s 
truck, approached the open driver’s-side win-
dow of his vehicle and punched him with her 
left hand as she pointed a 9–millimeter fire-
arm with her right. 
A 911 dispatcher told her to stand down, 
but the police said the call recorded Ms. 
Payne’s demands: ‘‘Get out of the car,’’ she 
yelled, using a vulgarity. A single shot was 
fired, and Mr. Herring stepped out of the 
truck and died. 
Ms. Payne, described by her lawyer as an 
‘‘all-American girl’’ who ‘‘thought she was 
helping out,’’ is now facing a long prison 
term for a killing that shares eerie similar-
ities to the shooting death of Mr. Arbery, 
who was killed in February after a father 
and son told the authorities they thought he 
was the suspect of a rash of recent break-ins 
in their neighborhood. 
‘‘When I saw that Arbery case, I thought, 
‘Here we go again,’ ’’ Mr. Herring’s widow, 
Christine Herring, said in an interview. 
To Ms. Herring, people like the young 
woman who killed her husband feel empow-
ered by the law to handle criminal matters 
on their own. 
A Georgia prosecutor, George E. Barnhill, 
cited the state’s citizen’s arrest law as the 
reason Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, 
Travis McMichael, 34, should not be held re-
sponsible for Mr. Arbery’s death. 
In a letter to the Glynn County Police De-
partment, Mr. Barnhill, who eventually 
recused himself from the case, wrote that 
the men were in ‘‘hot pursuit’’ of Mr. Arbery, 
and that they had ‘‘solid first hand probable 
cause’’ that he was a ‘‘burglary suspect.’’ 
There is no evidence that Mr. Arbery had 
committed a burglary, and he was not armed 
when he was chased down. 
The McMichaels were arrested last week 
and charged with aggravated assault and 
murder, more than two months after the 
shooting death and after a different pros-
ecutor asked the Georgia Bureau of Inves-
tigation for assistance. 
According to Mr. Robbins’ research, some 
states do not allow citizen’s arrest of mis-
demeanors unless the misdemeanor involves 
a ‘‘breach of the peace.’’ Others only allow 
citizens to make the arrest if they witnessed 
the crime themselves. The laws vary across 
the country regarding the level of probable 
cause that is required, and how long a person 
is allowed to detain someone. 
In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Wis-
consin, an arrest is allowed if a citizen per-
sonally witnesses a felony. California allows 
a citizen’s arrest of a misdemeanor even if 
the person did not directly witness it. 
Statutes also differ on how certain the cit-
izen has to be that the crime was committed, 
Mr. Robbins wrote. In Arkansas, the citizen 
can be ‘‘reasonably sure,’’ but in New York, 
if the felony was not actually committed, 
someone who wrongly takes a person into 
custody can wind up liable for false arrest. 
In Gary, Ind., last fall, a city councilman 
who apprehended a teenager he believed had 
stolen his car days earlier was charged with 
kidnapping. 
‘‘It can get messy,’’ said Ronald L. Carlson, 
a law professor at the University of Georgia. 
‘‘A citizen who is being arrested is much less 
inclined to be cooperative if it’s not some-
body with a blue uniform on.’’ 
In Georgia, the law states that a private 
person may arrest someone if a crime is 
committed in his presence or ‘‘within his im-
mediate knowledge.’’ 
But if it is a felony, the citizen can stop 
someone from escaping if the citizen has 
‘‘reasonable and probable grounds of sus-
picion.’’ 
The current Georgia law is about a decade 
old, but versions of a nearly identical statute 
have existed in the state since 1863. 
In the Clayton County case, leaving the 
scene of an accident with no injuries is a 
misdemeanor, so Georgia law would not have 
authorized Ms. Payne to chase down Mr. Her-
ring. 
Further, Mr. Herring initially stopped at 
the accident scene, but he apparently was 
having a diabetic episode and got back in his 
car and left, his wife said, so it was unclear 
whether he would have been charged with 
any crime at all. 
Ms. Payne and her lawyer, Matt Tucker, 
did not respond to requests for comment. 
At her bond hearing last year, Mr. Tucker 
said his client was ‘‘not a menace to society 
as people want to portray her.’’ 
‘‘She’s a young individual that got on the 
phone with 911 and thought she was helping 
out,’’ the Clayton News Daily quoted him 
saying. ‘‘At her age, she learned a very valu-
able lesson.’’ 
In the killing of Mr. Arbery, someone 
called 911 beforehand to say that a man was 
inside a house under construction. If that 
man was Mr. Arbery, and he was there with-
out permission but stole nothing, then he 
could have been charged with trespassing, a 
misdemeanor, said Lawrence J. Zimmerman, 
the president of the Georgia Association of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers. That means, Mr. 
Zimmerman said, the men who went after 
him would not have been authorized to give 
chase. 
Force can only be used to prevent a violent 
felony, Mr. Zimmerman said, adding, ‘‘What 
is not lawful is, you can’t detain somebody 
and then use force.’’ 
But a person making a citizen’s arrest who 
is then attacked could try to claim self-de-
fense, he said, as the McMichaels have 
claimed—although it would not necessarily 
be successful. 
On Tuesday, Georgia lawmakers said they 
would move forward with proposals to strip 
that protection from state law. 
‘‘The citizen’s arrest has to be abolished in 
this state,’’ State Representative James Bev-
erly, a Democrat, said at a news conference 
in Brunswick on Tuesday. ‘‘We can’t have 
this happen again in this country and cer-
tainly not in the state of Georgia.’’ 
Ms. Herring said she would love to see the 
law abolished. ‘‘The law is protecting them 
for some reason,’’ she said of those who had 
cited it as a defense. And of the woman ac-
cused of killing her husband, she added, 
‘‘What gives her the right? Let me tell you, 
she is not the police.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. So the citizen’s 
arrest laws should be very clear. The 
defendants were wrong. The case re-
sulted in a conviction because the case 
says that you have to witness the 
crime, and they did not. 
I include in the RECORD an article ti-
tled ‘‘Ahmaud Arbery and the case for 
getting rid of citizen’s arrests.’’ 
[From the Vox, Nov. 10, 2021] 
AHMAUD ARBERY AND THE CASE FOR GETTING 
RID OF CITIZEN’S ARRESTS 
Nearly two years after Ahmaud Arbery, a 
25-year-old Black man, was shot and killed 
in a suburban Georgia town while jogging, 
the three white suspects accused of the slay-
ing—Greg 
McMichael, 
his 
son 
Travis 
McMichael, and their neighbor, William 
‘‘Roddie’’ Bryan—are now on trial. They face 
charges on a total of nine counts, including 
malice murder, felony murder, aggravated 
assault, and false imprisonment. 
Arbery’s killing in February 2020 ignited 
national outrage. When a video Bryan re-
corded from his vehicle while following 
Arbery went viral online, viewers called it an 
unequivocal lynching. The graphic footage 
shows the McMichaels, both carrying guns, 
pursuing Arbery in a truck after he ran down 
their street in the mostly white Satilla 
Shores neighborhood near Brunswick. Fol-
lowing a short chase, the men corner Arbery, 
and a confrontation between Arbery and 
Travis McMichael ensues. During the strug-
gle, Arbery is shot three times, twice in the 
chest, after which he slumps to the ground. 
It took 74 days after Arbery’s death for the 
men to be arrested and charged. 
Defense attorneys will likely argue that 
the men’s actions were protected by Geor-
gia’s citizen’s arrest law, which at the time

December 1, 2021 
allowed a person to detain someone whom 
they believe just committed a crime. The at-
torneys may claim the men acted in self-de-
fense while attempting to carry out a legiti-
mate citizen’s arrest of Arbery, whom they 
suspected of burglary. 
Georgia’s outdated and dangerous citizen’s 
arrest law—one that was created in an era of 
slavery and emboldened citizens to act on 
their worst biases—has since been repealed. 
The law was replaced with a bill that limits 
who can detain citizens and when (business 
owners and workers who witness someone 
shoplifting or dining and dashing, for exam-
ple.) But most states still have a version of 
these laws on the books, and as long as they 
endure, advocates say they could ultimately 
have tragic consequences. 
CITIZEN’S ARREST LAWS ARE UBIQUITOUS, WITH 
OLD ROOTS 
Georgia’s citizen’s arrest statute had its 
origins in the Civil War era. Passed in 1863, 
when slavery was still considered legal by 
Southerners despite the Emancipation Proc-
lamation, the law stated that a private per-
son could ‘‘arrest an offender if the offense is 
committed in his presence or within his im-
mediate knowledge.’’ 
‘‘It was a slave-catching law for slaves that 
attempted to flee,’’ Joe Margulies, an attor-
ney and professor of law and government at 
Cornell Law School, told Vox. ‘‘It gave citi-
zens the power to grab them. [The law] de-
rives from a racist past.’’ 
Every state has some version of a citizen’s 
arrest law, though they vary based on the 
type of crime and whether the citizen must 
witness the crime directly or just be aware 
that it happened. In many states, the laws 
are unclear about how long a citizen is per-
mitted to detain someone, how much prob-
able cause is necessary, and how much force 
can be used, said Ira P. Robbins, professor of 
law and justice at American University and 
the author of an article on citizen’s arrest 
laws for the Cornell Journal of Law and Pub-
lic Policy. Many of the laws also don’t speci-
fy what it means to carry out a citizen’s ar-
rest or to detain someone while making one. 
The laws, according to Robbins, date back 
to medieval England, where citizens helped 
the king maintain order by enforcing the 
laws. The common law doctrine of citizen’s 
arrest was further developed in the early 
19th century, and such statutes have re-
mained on the books even as states laid out 
more modern systems of law enforcement. 
In Alabama, for example, a private person 
can make a citizen’s arrest ‘‘where a felony 
has committed’’—even if they didn’t witness 
it—and when they have ‘‘reasonable cause to 
believe that the person arrested committed 
it.’’ The law specifies that the arrest can be 
made ‘‘on any day and at any time,’’ outlines 
the steps that must be taken for a legal ar-
rest, and gives citizens permission to break 
open doors or windows to capture the alleged 
offender. 
California allows citizen’s arrests if the 
citizen witnesses a perpetrator committing a 
misdemeanor, or when a felony ‘‘has been in 
fact committed, and he has reasonable cause 
for believing the person arrested to have 
committed it,’’ according to the state’s penal 
code. 
In New York, a citizen can arrest another 
person if they believe the suspect committed 
a felony such as murder, first-degree man-
slaughter, or rape. It also lays out the cir-
cumstances where deadly physical force may 
be justified: when the citizen believes it is 
necessary to defend themselves or a third 
person against physical force in the course of 
the crime. (They may not if they know that 
they ‘‘may avoid the necessity of so doing by 
retreating.’’) 
‘‘I thought that the uproar over Arbery’s 
murder would lead other states to revisit 
their statues, but there has not been much 
[movement],’’ Margulies said. ‘‘It certainly 
has not prompted a wholesale reexamination 
of citizen’s arrest laws.’’ 
CITIZEN’S ARRESTS CAN GO HORRIBLY WRONG 
Arbery’s killing isn’t the first involving 
Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law. In 2019, Ken-
neth Herring, a 62-year-old Black man, was 
killed by Hannah Payne, a 21-year-old white 
woman, after he left the scene of a car crash 
because he was experiencing a diabetic emer-
gency. Payne pursued Herring in her vehicle 
and ordered him out of his car. It’s unclear 
what happened immediately after that, but 
Payne shot and killed him. She was indicted 
on charges of felony murder and malice mur-
der, among others, and is still awaiting trial. 
Critics say she racially profiled Herring. 
‘‘Given what we know about implicit and 
explicit bias, allowing people to chase after 
someone and seize them based on what they 
believe was a felony is a recipe for some pre-
dictable number of cases just like this,’’ 
Margulies said. ‘‘With the automatic asso-
ciation between blackness and crime, seeing 
a Black man run by or drive away will lead 
to some predictable number of cases of folks 
concluding he’s committing a felony. That’s 
the real problem.’’ 
In 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer 
George Zimmerman, a mixed-race Hispanic 
man, fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Mar-
tin in Florida after calling 911 and reporting 
‘‘a suspicious person’’; the police dispatcher 
instructed him not to approach Martin. Zim-
merman, who was later acquitted of second- 
degree manslaughter, said he acted in self- 
defense. 
‘‘When you look at these cases, it’s about 
people trying to protect an area—not pro-
tecting it from a crime, but protecting it 
from certain types of people,’’ Rashawn Ray, 
a sociology professor at the University of 
Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brook-
ings Institution, told Vox. 
Citizen’s arrest laws can also go wrong in 
other ways—as in 2014, when a man in Vir-
ginia burst into a lecture hall at George 
Mason University Law School carrying hand-
cuffs, pepper spray, and a Taser-like device 
in order to execute a citizen’s arrest of a pro-
fessor whom he said had controlled his mind 
and sexually harassed him. In May 2020, a 22- 
year-old man in Arizona was shot and killed 
after he witnessed a hit-and-run and chased 
five people who ran from the scene in an at-
tempt to detain them. 
But in cases with a racial element, the 
laws are part of the pernicious way that 
‘‘place, space, and race’’ intersect, Ray said. 
Also factoring into the Arbery trial are 
Georgia’s open carry law (which makes it 
legal to openly carry firearms in the state 
with the proper permits) and ‘‘stand your 
ground’’ law (which allows for the use of 
deadly force if a person reasonably believes 
it is necessary to prevent death or severe 
bodily injury). 
‘‘We will likely hear from the defense at-
torneys a series of dog whistles about pro-
tecting people in that particular community 
from people who look like Ahmaud Arbery,’’ 
Ray said. ‘‘With laws like the castle doc-
trine, people will probably believe that good 
Samaritans have a right to also defend their 
neighbors’ property and that the McMichaels 
were coming to the defense of others. The de-
fense will try to indicate to jurors that [a 
burglary] could have happened to them.’’ 
The trial judge will instruct the jury on 
the citizen’s arrest law as it existed at the 
time of the killing, though Georgia has since 
repealed and replaced the law. 
The protests surrounding Arbery’s death— 
which preceded those for Breanna Taylor and 
George Floyd, arguably setting the stage for 
what was to come in the summer of 2020—and 
the nearly two years that have elapsed since 
then have not inspired a large movement to 
rethink citizen’s arrest laws. 
After the video of Arbery’s killing went 
viral, South Carolina state Rep. Justin Bam-
berg introduced legislation to repeal the 
state’s 1866 citizen’s arrest law. Bamberg 
said on Twitter that the law was no longer 
necessary in America’s police state. 
In an effort to honor Arbery, New York 
lawmakers moved to revise the language in 
the state’s citizen’s arrest statute, calling 
the law a ‘‘dangerous and historically abused 
practice’’ that has been ‘‘used by racists to 
advance their bigoted goals.’’ The bill never 
advanced. 
No matter the verdict, the Arbery trial 
could draw more attention to the anachro-
nistic rules of citizen’s arrest laws. 
‘‘All of these citizen’s arrest cases with a 
racial element are on the same continuum,’’ 
said Ray, of the University of Maryland and 
Brookings Institution. ‘‘They end up in the 
exact same way. They end up with someone 
being killed.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me quickly 
say that we have the castle law, the 
stand your ground self-defense, and 
citizen’s arrest. I believe all of these 
should be put into the mix of review, 
and there should be Federal law that 
governs how these State laws are done. 
Someone is going to argue the 10th 
Amendment and States’ rights, but if 
you have these numbers of inequity in 
killing and justifiable homicides, and 
race is a factor, it needs to stop. 
I know Trayvon Martin’s mother and 
father. They have worked without 
ceasing. This is the saddest and most 
horrific and heinous results of stand 
your ground self-defense. This young 
man was just walking with Skittles, 
walking with an iced tea. 
I heard the description of a young 
man being confronted by a grownup 
and fearing for his life, tumbling to the 
ground with the grownup and was shot 
point-blank. The grownup was acquit-
ted because of the stand your ground 
self-defense. 
The Federal Government needs to in-
tervene. Ahmaud Arbery, with a pray-
ing mother, Georgia law requires the 
witnessing of a crime. I see a man run-
ning for his life, a man of dignity run-
ning for his life. But yet, it took three 
prosecutors to get to the point of ac-
knowledging the human dignity, the 
humanity of this young man. 
We have yet to get justice for this 
mother’s child that is Trayvon Martin 
and many others who have fallen unno-
ticed under the arm of stand your 
ground self-defense, citizen’s arrest, 
and the castle law. 
I think we should be very clear. I am 
not looking to take away the rights of 
homeowners 
legitimately 
protecting 
themselves or self-defense when there 
is no other option. But we have allowed 
gun violence to take hold of the psyche 
and the behavior of America. 
As the Giffords Law Center said, 
there was a 32 percent increase in rates 
of firearm homicide, a 24 percent in-
crease in rates of homicide overall, and 
a 45 percent increase in firearm homi-
cides among adolescents. With the ex-
treme amount of gun violence, we need 
to determine whether or not every

State self-defense law should be defined 
specifically, and there should be a re-
quirement of retreating where you can. 
We should determine that if there are 
States with citizen’s arrest, that the 
onus is on the individual seeing the 
crime to call official law enforcement. 
We hope those law enforcement are 
trained to not take action into their 
own hands, to not allow your judgment 
to supersede those who are trained and 
wear the uniform. 
The castle law, stand your ground, 
when you have other options than to 
shoot point-blank and to kill people, 
and if you are a 17-year-old with an 
AR–15 and you can go into court, and 
there is not one aspect of your behav-
ior that is illegal, then there needs to 
be a Federal review of the State law. 
There was nothing to attribute to 
this individual that they had broken 
the law coming across State lines, that 
they provoked the incident. Yet, they 
were able to use, unfortunately, the 
stand your ground self-defense law. 
Gun violence continues to be a disease 
in this country. 
I would just like to, for a moment, 
talk more about the citizen’s arrest. 
For example, the Georgia citizen’s ar-
rest law that was at issue in the Arbery 
trial was codified in section 17–4-60, 
Grounds for arrest: ‘‘A private person 
may arrest an offender if the offense is 
committed in his presence or within 
his immediate knowledge. If the of-
fense is a felony and the offender is es-
caping or attempting to escape . . . ‘’ 
None of that occurred with Mr. 
Arbery. It wasn’t in their knowledge. 
They didn’t see it. The offense wasn’t a 
felony. It might have been trespass if it 
even existed. The defendant was not es-
caping or attempting to escape. He was 
on a Sunday jog, which you, as a free 
person in the United States, should be 
allowed to do. 
‘‘A private person may arrest him 
upon reasonable and probable grounds 
of suspicion,’’ codified from the Civil 
War in order for citizens to really ille-
gally detain runaway slaves. Other 
Southern States enacted similar laws 
for similar reasons during this period, 
nothing but a figment or an action of 
Jim Crow laws. It is time for the Fed-
eral Government to step in. 
I question, with so many guns in 
America, whether it is safe to continue 
a relic like citizen’s arrest. There are 
18,000 police departments in the United 
States of America with the right kind 
of training. There is no reason why any 
individual could not retreat to call law 
enforcement or to call law enforcement 
appropriately. 
Tonight, I came to honor those whose 
lives were lost and there was no re-
sponse, none whatsoever. Trayvon Mar-
tin becomes singularly that symbol, 
even Tamir Rice or Breonna Taylor or 
maybe even Eric Garner. 
These cases must be addressed, and I 
look forward to addressing these for 
the Nation and working to secure hear-
ings and witnesses on how wrong these 
laws are, how unequal they are, how 
scattered they are, and how undefined 
they are. 
As I close, we must recognize the 
value of our constitutional principles 
and that little book that is the Bill of 
Rights that guarantees us the freedom 
of access, due process, the right to 
vote, a constitutional presence in this 
Nation. These laws under a criminal 
unjust system have to be changed. 
America needs to know that the kill-
ing of individuals with no adjusting 
and accountability is unacceptable. I 
am on the floor this evening to indi-
cate that enough is enough and that we 
must proceed with the review of laws 
that can kill without accountability. 
In the names of those and the loved 
ones who suffer because they are gone, 
I commit myself to addressing with my 
colleagues the injustices that exist 
today. No more. No more. I am grateful 
for Ahmaud Arbery, but no more will 
we stand for this inequity. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, and the author of 
several key legislative provisions, of H.R. 
1280, the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act 
of 2021, I am pleased to anchor this Special 
Order on the importance and urgent need for 
reforms in the criminal justice system to sev-
eral legal or judicial doctrines that that dis-
proportionately, adversely, and unfairly affect 
black persons, particularly black males aged 
18–35. 
Specifically, the legal and judicial doctrines 
I will discuss this evening are: (1) self-de-
fense; (2) stand-your-ground laws; and (3) 
laws empowering private citizens to make ar-
rests. 
Let me say at the outset, Madam Speaker, 
any questions that there continues to exist 
today racial double-standards, disparities, and 
systemic racism in policing and the administra-
tion of justice were conclusively laid to rest by 
what social scientists would regard as a ‘‘nat-
ural experiment’’ that took place in Wash-
ington, D.C. beginning in the summer and cul-
minating with the January 6, 2021 insurrection 
and siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump 
seditionists incited by the 45th President of the 
United States. 
Mass protests and political rallies that took 
place in Washington D.C. started May 29, 
2020, four days after George Floyd died in 
Minnesota, after a Minneapolis police officer 
kneeled on his neck for more than’’ eight min-
utes. 
By the millions, Americans took to the 
streets in protest to affirm that no longer will 
the people of this country tolerate or acqui-
esce in horrible policing practices that include 
excessive and unnecessary uses of lethal 
force that has diminished community trust of 
policing practices across the country and has 
angered and terrified communities of color 
who are overwhelmingly and disproportion-
ately its innocent victims. 
Within days of the demonstrations, U.S. At-
torney General Bill Barr announced that mul-
tiple law enforcement agencies, including the 
National Guard, Secret Service and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, would ‘‘flood the 
zone’’ in D.C. 
Thousands of law enforcement officials, 
armed with tear gas, rubber bullets and fire-
arms were deployed to protect the city. 
Hundreds of people were arrested, D.C. po-
lice records show. 
More than 300 were arrested on June 1, 
2020, the day Attorney General Barr ordered 
law enforcement to forcefully clear peaceful 
protesters from a perimeter near the White 
House, making room for President Trump to 
pose for cameras while waving a Bible in front 
of St. John’s Episcopal Church. 
It was the largest number of arrests re-
corded for any day during the summer of 
events. 
Across the nation, law enforcement made 
an estimated 14,000 arrests in 49 U.S. cities 
during anti-racism protests in the summer of 
2020, according to the Washington Post. 
Following the November 3, 2020 election of 
Joe Biden and running mate KAMALA HARRIS, 
large groups of Trump supporters held rallies 
in the city, where they clashed with counter- 
protesters. 
Police made 20 arrests during the so-called 
Million MAGA March on November 14, 2020, 
an event in which Trump-supporters, including 
white nationalists, far-right extremist groups, 
and conservative politicians gathered in D.C. 
to protest the election results. 
And, incredibly, only 61 arrests were made 
of rioters, who were overwhelming white and 
who used violence, that stormed the Capitol 
on January 6, an attack that claimed the lives 
of at least six persons, injured hundreds of 
others, caused horrific damage to property 
and national treasures, and inflicted emotional 
scars that will not heal for generations. 
But most of these arrests are related to 
charges 
involving 
curfew 
violations—D.C. 
mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 6 p.m. cur-
few, though mobs had broken into the Capitol 
hours earlier, around 1:30 p.m. 
There were only four non-curfew-related ar-
rests, compared to 40 non-curfew-related ar-
rests during Black Lives Matter protests on 
June 1, 2020. 
Madam Speaker, the horrifying killing of 
George Floyd on May 25, 2020 by a Min-
neapolis police office shocked and awakened 
the moral consciousness of the nation. 
Untold millions saw the terrifying last 8:46 of 
life drained from a black man, George Floyd, 
taking his last breaths face down in the street 
with his neck under the knee of a police officer 
who, along with his three cohorts, was indif-
ferent to his cries for help and pleas that he 
‘‘can’t breathe.’’ 
The civil disobedience witnessed nightly in 
the streets of America in response to the kill-
ing of George Floyd were also in memory of 
countless acts of the inequality and cruelty vis-
ited upon young African American men and 
women no longer with us in body but forever 
with us in memory. 
Beloved souls like Breonna Taylor in Louis-
ville, Kentucky; Stephon Clark in Sacramento, 
California; Eric Garner and Sean Bell in New 
York City; Sandra Bland in Waller County, 
Texas; Jordan Baker in Houston, Texas; 12- 
year old Tamir Rice in Cleveland; and Michael 
Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 
They remember as well the senseless 
killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin 
by self-appointed vigilantes. 
And the continuing need for their activism 
was reflected in the outrageous and senseless 
slaughter of Rayshard Brooks, who was sim-
ply sleeping in his car at a local Wendy’s res-
taurant, by a uniformed officer of the Atlanta 
Police Department. 
It was reflected again on August 23, 2020, 
when a Kenosha Police Department officer

shot Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old black man, 
in the back seven times—yes, seven—as he 
attempted to enter his SUV where three of his 
young sons were in the back seat. 
Indeed, the history goes back much further, 
past Amidon Diallo in New York City, past the 
Central Park Five, past Emmitt Till, past the 
racist abuse of law enforcement power during 
the struggle for civil rights and equal treat-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, the times we are in de-
mand that action be taken and that is pre-
cisely what my colleagues in the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and Congressional Democrats did in 
introducing and steering to passage in the 
House of H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act. 
I support this bold legislation not just as a 
senior member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee who also served on the House Working 
Group on Police Strategies, but also a mother 
of a young African American male who knows 
the anxiety that African American mothers feel 
until they can hug their sons and daughters 
who return home safely, and on behalf of all 
those relatives and friends who grieve over 
the loss a loved one whose life and future was 
wrongly and cruelly interrupted or ended by 
mistreatment at the hands of the police. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 
2021 is designed to destroy the pillars of sys-
temic racism in policing practices that has vic-
timized communities of color, and especially 
African Americans for decades, is overdue, 
too long overdue. 
This legislation puts the Congress of the 
United States goes on record against racial 
profiling in policing and against the excessive, 
unjustified, and discriminatory use of lethal 
and force by law enforcement officers against 
persons of color. 
The legislation means no longer will employ-
ment of practices that encourage systemic 
mistreatment of persons because of their race 
be ignored or tolerated. 
When the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act is finally signed into law, the government 
of the United States will be declaring firmly, 
forcefully, and unequivocally that Black Lives 
Matter. 
It is true all lives matter, they always have. 
But that Black lives matter too, and in so 
many other areas of civic life, this nation has 
not always lived up to its promise but that the 
promise is worthy of fulfilling. 
In general, self-defense is a legal justifica-
tion for the otherwise illegal use of force. 
In the instance of self-defense that results in 
a death, although an unlawful killing did occur, 
it is considered a justified killing. 
Typically, 
to 
succeed 
on 
self-defense 
grounds requires: (1) an unprovoked attack 
(i.e. the killer was not the aggressor), (2) the 
killer reasonably believed that they were in im-
minent danger of death or serious bodily in-
jury, and (3) the use of force was reasonable 
to the perceived threat. 
Additionally, self-defense laws traditionally 
place a duty to retreat on the killer, requiring 
retreat prior to using deadly force, but only if 
retreat is reasonably possible and will not 
place the individual in continued danger. 
The ‘‘castle doctrine’’ is an expansion of 
self-defense laws—both statutory and at com-
mon law—in which removes the duty to retreat 
for self-defense on individuals inside their own 
home. 
This principle has been codified and ex-
panded by the majority of state legislatures in 
a variety of ways, including through so-called 
‘‘stand-your-ground laws.’’ 
Stand-your-ground laws are an extension of 
the Castle Doctrine to areas outside of an indi-
vidual’s home such that there is no duty to re-
treat for self-defense justification. 
The name is derived from statutory lan-
guage found in several of state laws that 
states that an individual may ‘‘stand his or her 
ground.’’ 
Laws in at least 25 states do not require the 
retreat from an attacker in any place in which 
one is lawfully present: Alabama, Alaska, Ari-
zona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kan-
sas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mis-
sissippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Penn-
sylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten-
nessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. 
Additionally, seven states have expanded 
castle doctrine to motor vehicles or the work-
place: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Ne-
braska, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. 
Stand-your-ground laws came under na-
tional scrutiny during the trial of George Zim-
merman, who was acquitted in the 2012 
shooting death of Trayvon Martin. 
In that case, Martin, 17, was walking home 
after buying Skittles from a nearby conven-
ience store. 
At the time, Zimmerman was a neighbor-
hood watch volunteer who called police after 
spotting Martin. 
Despite being told by the 911 operator to re-
main in his car until officers arrived, Zimmer-
man instead confronted Martin. 
It remains unclear whether a fight ensued, 
who was the aggressor and whether Zimmer-
man had injuries consistent with his claims of 
being beaten up by Martin. 
Zimmerman was the sole survivor; Martin, 
who was unarmed, died from a gunshot 
wound. 
Florida’s stand-your-ground law is codified 
in Florida Code 776.012 (2): A person is justi-
fied in using or threatening to use deadly force 
if he or she reasonably believes that using or 
threatening to use such force is necessary to 
prevent imminent death or great bodily harm 
to himself or herself or another or to prevent 
the imminent commission of a forcible felony. 
A person who uses or threatens to use deadly 
force in accordance with this subsection does 
not have a duty to retreat and has the right to 
stand his or her ground if the person using or 
threatening to use the deadly force is not en-
gaged in a criminal activity and is in a place 
where he or she has a right to be. 
According to the Urban Institute Report, the 
rate of justifiable homicides is almost six times 
higher in case with attributes that match the 
Trayvon Martin case. 
Racial disparities are much larger, as white- 
on-black homicides have justifiable findings 33 
percentage points more often than black-on- 
white homicides. 
Stand Your Ground laws appear to exacer-
bate those differences, as cases overall are 
significantly more likely to be ruled justified in 
SYG states than in non-SYG states. 
With respect to race, controlling for all other 
case attributes, the odds a white-on-black 
homicide is found justified is 281 percent 
greater than the odds a white-on-white homi-
cide is found justified. 
By contrast, a black-on-white homicide has 
barely half the odds of being ruled justifiable 
relative to white-on-white homicides 
Statistically, black-on-black homicides have 
the same odds of ( being ruled justifiable as 
white-on-white homicides. 
White men are more likely to successfully 
invoke the use of stand your ground laws for 
their defense after a shooting than Black 
Americans 
or 
women, 
especially 
Black 
women. 
Nationally, the likelihood of a homicide 
being ruled justified is 281 percent greater 
when the defendant is white and the victim is 
Black when compared to cases where both 
the defendant and victim are white. 
In contrast, the likelihood of a homicide 
being ruled justified when the defendant is 
Black and the victim white is 49 percent lower 
compared to cases where both the defendant 
and victim are white 
States with stand your ground laws specifi-
cally are linked to a 65 percent increase in the 
odds of a homicide being ruled justified, driven 
primarily by cases where the defendant is 
white. 
When a white person shoots a Black person 
in a stand your ground state, the odds that the 
homicide will be ruled justified increase by 
seven percentage points. 
According to the Coalition to Stop Gun Vio-
lence, in 68 percent of successful stand your 
ground law claims in Florida, the person killed 
was unarmed. 
One study of cases in which stand your 
ground was used as a defense in Florida from 
2005 through 2012 found that in 79 percent of 
the cases where such claims succeeded, the 
defendant could have retreated to avoid the 
confrontation. 
States have deemed justified killings of vic-
tims who were facing away, retreating or even 
lying on the ground when they were shot. 
One in three stand your ground defendants 
in Florida had a documented history of illegally 
carrying a gun or threatening others with a 
gun. 
In nearly a third of Florida’s stand your 
ground self-defense claims, the defendant initi-
ated the conflict. 
A number of studies examining homicide 
and violent crime rates consistently show that 
the passage of stand your ground laws in-
crease homicides and gun injuries. 
One study analyzed ten years (2000–2010) 
of FBI data in 21 states that passed stand 
your ground laws during the study period. 
The authors found that there was no evi-
dence that these laws reduce burglary, rob-
bery, or aggravated assault. 
On the contrary, this study found that the 
passage of stand your ground laws was linked 
to an 8 percent increase in the number of 
homicides, translating to an additional 600 
homicides annually across states that adopted 
such laws. 
A subsequent paper that examined vital sta-
tistics reported by the CDC found a similar in-
crease of 7.5 percent in the overall firearm 
homicide rate as a result of stand your ground 
laws. 
This study also found that stand your 
ground laws increase emergency room visits 
for nonfatal firearm injuries using data from 
State Emergency Department Databases. 
Finally, according to Gifford’s Law Center, 
lead to: 
A 32 percent increase in rates of firearm 
homicide and a 24 percent increase in rates of 
homicide overall; 
A 45 percent increase in firearm homicides 
among adolescents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6857 
December 1, 2021 
The law of citizen’s arrest dates to 13th cen-
tury England—a time when modern-day cops 
would be unrecognizable. 
The practice immigrated to the American 
colonies and quickly became a convenient 
legal pretext for the persecution of the 
enslaved population. 
Today, killings under citizen arrest speak to 
a key social psychological concept: subjective 
uncertainty, which states that when there is 
minimal information, people rely on stereo-
types to discriminate. 
The nation saw this clearly in the case of 
Ahmaud Arbery, whose only crime was being 
Black at the wrong place and wrong time, that 
discrimination resulted in homicide. 
Beginning in the mid-1600s, enforcing the 
subjugation of Black Americans was a public 
responsibility: volunteer militias gave way to 
formal slave patrols, which wielded citizen’s 
arrest statutes to brazenly and legally intimi-
date the Black population. 
In the British colonies and the new United 
States, citizen’s arrest melded with efforts to 
prevent slave escapes with the formation of 
slave patrols and fugitive slave ads that of-
fered bounties for the return of freedom-seek-
ers who, if caught, were frequently brutally 
punished. 
Fugitive slave vigilantism was even incor-
porated into the United States Constitution 
with the agreement that all states would return 
captured slaves to bondage. 
Following the passage of the 13th Amend-
ment and the creation of the Ku Klux Klan, 
armed white vigilantes, under the cover of citi-
zen’s arrest laws, were able to terrorize Black 
Americans into a new form of subservience. 
Through the 19th and 20th centuries, some 
state courts explicitly codified citizen’s arrests 
laws; other states still rely on common law 
precedents. These pro-vigilante laws are in 49 
of America’s 50 states in one form or another. 
Some might argue that the intent of citizen’s 
arrests can be separated from its racist appli-
cations, but such a separation is impossible 
when the letter of the law is actively racist. 
Georgia’s laws were formally codified in 
1861 by Thomas Cobb, a lawyer and slave-
holder. 
In the original code, African Americans were 
assumed to be enslaved unless they could 
prove free status. 
Georgia’s Citizen’s Arrest statues were first 
entered into the Law Code of Georgia in 1863. 
In 1863, Georgia law enforcement was in 
serious disarray—confederates were desert-
ing, the Union army was preparing to invade 
the state, and enslaved people were fleeing 
plantations to join Union forces. 
With its criminal justice system in a state of 
collapse, the 1863 code revision empowered 
white Georgians to replace law enforcement 
and slave patrols to keep the enslaved Black 
population under control. After the Civil War, 
citizen’s arrest supported Ku Klux Klan vio-
lence against Black Georgians. 
On January 22, 1912, four African Ameri-
cans in Hamilton—three men and a woman— 
were citizen’s arrested and lynched, accused 
of killing a white planter who was sexually 
abusing Black girls and women. 
On July 25, 1946, two African American 
couples were dragged from their car at 
Moore’s Ford in Walton County and shot 
about sixty times by a mob of white men mak-
ing a ‘‘citizen’s arrest.’’ 
No one was ever charged with their mur-
ders. 
Every African American parent, and every 
African America child, knows all too well ‘The 
Talk’ and the importance of abiding by the 
rules for surviving interactions with the police 
and vigilantees. 
As I have stated many times, direct action 
is vitally important but to be effective it must 
be accompanied by political, legislative, and 
governmental action, which is necessary be-
cause the strength and foundation of demo-
cratic government rests upon the consent and 
confidence of the governed. 
Effective enforcement of the law and admin-
istration of justice requires the confidence of 
the community that the law will be enforced 
impartially and that all persons are treated 
equally without regard to race or ethnicity or 
religion or national origin. 
As the great jurist Judge Learned Hand 
said: ‘‘If we are to keep our democracy, there 
must be one commandment: thou shalt not ra-
tion justice.’’ 
Equal justice is the proud promise America 
makes to all persons; the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act of 2021 will help make that 
promise a lived reality for African Americans, 
who have not ever known it to be true in the 
area of community-police relations. 
And when Black Lives Matter, then and only 
then can it truthfully be said that all lives mat-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BORDER SEURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, back in 
September, a small little Texas border 
town, Del Rio, TX, was thrown into the 
national spotlight. This is a small town 
on the U.S.-Mexico border of 35,000 peo-
ple, and over the course of several days 
they had 15 to 20,000 Haitian migrants 
show up, camping out underneath a 
bridge. 
Migrants huddled under the bridge to 
escape triple-digit temperatures. It is 
still hot in September in Texas. And 
they had minimal access to sanitation, 
food, and clean water. The images of 
this crisis looked like they were taken 
from a Third World country, not from 
the United States of America. 
This massive surge should not have 
caught the Biden administration off 
guard. As a matter of fact, they should 
know 
that 
their 
policies 
have 
incentivized and encouraged this sort 
of influx of humanity across our bor-
der. 
Border Patrol had been asking their 
leadership for more resources as far 
back as June, but come September, 
those resources weren’t available; and 
despite the warnings, the Biden admin-
istration was completely unprepared. 
So what is the Border Patrol sup-
posed to do when you see this mass in-
flux of humanity come across the bor-
der for which the administration is 
completely unprepared in a town that 
lacks the infrastructure to deal with 
this influx? 
Well, the Border Patrol did what 
they needed to do. They were pulled off 
the front lines to provide humanitarian 
relief. But what that means is it leaves 
huge stretches of the border unpro-
tected against illegal immigration or, 
perhaps even more dangerous, illegal 
drug smuggling coming across the bor-
der. 
And the criminal organizations that 
operate these smuggling operations, 
whether they are migrants or they are 
drugs, they understand this. This is 
part of their game plan. But it is like 
they are playing three-dimensional 
chess while the U.S. Government is 
playing checkers. It is just not a fair 
fight or a fair matchup. But so far it 
has not, apparently, sunk into the 
Biden administration. 
Fortunately, we did have some orga-
nizations, like the Val Verde Border 
Humanitarian Coalition, step up to 
feed, house, and arrange transportation 
for these migrants. You could imagine 
what the challenge was just to feed 15 
to 20,000 people. There wasn’t a Porta- 
Potty to be had for 300 miles after they 
consolidated there to deal with the 
sanitation issues alone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8838 
December 1, 2021 
If not for the dedicated Border Patrol 
agents, U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection, and the incredible community 
organizations in Del Rio, this crisis 
could have been much, much worse. As 
a matter of fact, the sector chief of the 
Del Rio Sector told me that the fact 
that they did not have a loss of life was 
a miracle. 
I want to publicly express my grati-
tude to those who, in countless ways, 
went above and beyond the call of duty 
to mitigate this crisis the best they 
did. They don’t receive the gratitude 
they deserve, but they need more than 
our gratitude. They need our help. 
After the makeshift camp under the 
bridge was cleared, the national news 
died down. The reporters and cameras 
went away, but the problem did not. It 
is not a question of ‘‘if’’ there will be a 
repetition of what we saw in Del Rio in 
September; it is a question of ‘‘when’’ 
because none of the reasons those 15,000 
to 20,000 Haitian migrants have shown 
up has been fixed. 
Last week, I visited Del Rio, and I 
met with leaders in the community 
who told me about the challenges they 
are facing. The new chief of the Border 
Patrol sector, whom I mentioned a mo-
ment ago, told me that, while there 
were 15,000 to 20,000 migrants in that 
one episode in September, they are 
still averaging about 1,000 migrant en-
counters a day. So, in about 2 weeks’ 
time, they had the equivalent of what 
we saw last September in terms of the 
15,000 to 20,000 migrants because they 
are still getting 1,000 people a day. Yet 
it doesn’t command the attention of 
the news media and of the Nation like 
this incident in September did. 
So things are not getting any better. 
Agents are still being diverted from 
their normal duties to care for mi-
grants, including unaccompanied chil-
dren, which leaves, again, vast swaths 
of the border unprotected through 
which drugs are run—drugs that last 
year alone took the lives of more than 
100,000 American citizens, because the 
vast 
majority 
of 
fentanyl, 
meth-
amphetamine, 
heroin, 
cocaine, 
and 
other illegal drugs come across our 
southwestern border. 
The cartels understand, if you flood 
the zone and overwhelm the capacity of 
the local Border Patrol to deal with it, 
you are going to leave unprotected 
areas, and that is exactly the plan of 
these transnational criminal organiza-
tions. 
I spoke with a group of about 30 Bor-
der Patrol agents at muster. That is 
when they show up for their shift, from 
one shift to the next, where they learn, 
sort of, what is the latest information 
they need to know before they go out 
on patrol. When they were asked to 
raise their hands if they would be 
working out in the field that day, pa-
trolling the border, not a single hand 
was raised. That is because these 30 
Border Patrol agents were going to be 
pushing paper and processing migrants 
instead of being out on the frontlines, 
protecting our country against illegal 
immigration and the influx of illegal 
drugs. 
Again, the cartels understand this. 
This is part of their game plan, but, ap-
parently, the Biden administration and 
the powers that be here in Washington, 
DC, are completely oblivious to what 
the push and pull factors are for illegal 
immigration and illegal drugs across 
our border. 
These men and women of the Border 
Patrol are brave professionals, and 
they would normally be out on the 
frontlines, stopping dangerous people 
and substances from sneaking across 
the border, but now they are primarily 
tackling administrative duties—proc-
essing paperwork, watching children, 
transporting migrants—and trying to 
clean up the mess created by a failed 
border security policy by the Biden ad-
ministration. This is a dangerous situ-
ation that puts our entire country at 
risk. 
While these highly trained and dedi-
cated agents are pushing paper, who 
knows what is coming across the bor-
der? 
There is a clear and urgent need for 
Congress to take action to address this 
crisis in a meaningful and responsible 
way. 
Everybody, 
from 
Secretary 
Mayorkas on down, says that this is 
what is required under current policies. 
So my humble suggestion is those poli-
cies need to change, and that means 
only Congress can pass new laws to 
change those policies. 
So far, our Democratic colleagues, 
especially the leadership, have shown 
zero interest in engaging at all on how 
to solve this problem. They have spent 
the bulk of this year trying to figure 
out how you could break the rules of 
the Senate to reform our entire immi-
gration system by using the budget. 
This process wasn’t designed to fast- 
track partisan legislation or to cir-
cumvent responsible policymaking. It 
is not a loophole that allows the major-
ity party to do whatever it wants. 
The Senate Parliamentarian has al-
ready confirmed several times that our 
Democratic colleagues cannot use this 
budget reconciliation process to grant 
citizenship 
to 
millions 
of 
undocu-
mented immigrants, but they keep 
coming back, and, for some reason, the 
very people who would benefit from 
these policies don’t seem to hold our 
Democratic colleagues accountable for 
showing up empty-handed, notwith-
standing their promises of help to peo-
ple who are here in an undocumented 
status. 
Our Democratic colleagues continue 
arguing among themselves about how 
much of the population should receive 
some form of legal status without their 
putting one ounce of thought or ounce 
of effort into how the population got so 
big in the first place. They are cer-
tainly not considering what we need to 
do to prevent the number of people liv-
ing in the shadows from continuing to 
increase. 
I have said repeatedly that there is a 
clear and urgent crisis on our southern 
border, and President Biden and his ad-
ministration have proven to be either 
unwilling or incapable of addressing it. 
The numbers tell the tale. Last year, 
border crossings hit a record high— 
more than 1.7 million border crossings 
in a single year. That is a 30-year high. 
The backlog of immigration court 
cases has grown to nearly 1.5 million— 
that is 1.5 million pending court cases 
before immigration judges—and the av-
erage wait time for a single case to be 
decided is more than 21⁄2 years. 
Congress has a duty to take action to 
create change in this broken system, 
and it can only be done in a bipartisan 
way. It is not too late for our friends 
on the other side of the aisle to work 
with us and to abandon this attempt to 
do an ‘‘amnesty by partisan vote’’ on a 
Budget Act. It is not too late for them 
to work with us to address the crisis at 
hand, and I have a suggestion about a 
good place to start. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a bi-
partisan-bicameral bill with a fellow 
border State Senator, Ms. SINEMA, 
called the Bipartisan Border Solutions 
Act. We have also been proud to work 
with two of our House colleagues, Con-
gressman HENRY CUELLAR, a Blue Dog 
Democrat from Laredo—as the Pre-
siding Officer knows in having been to 
Laredo recently—and TONY GONZALES, 
who represents the 23rd Congressional 
District, the largest contiguous con-
gressional district to the U.S.-Mexico 
border. This legislation makes two 
modest but important changes to al-
leviate the strain on law enforcement 
and improve the way we process and 
care for these migrants. 
One would establish four regional 
processing centers in high-traffic areas 
along the border. These would be, in ef-
fect, a one-stop shop for the various 
government Agencies involved in proc-
essing the migrants. Migrants can re-
ceive medical screenings, have their 
identities verified, and go through a 
criminal history check—all in one 
place. They can also begin the legal 
process of seeking asylum. They will 
complete their ‘‘credible fear’’ inter-
views, go through legal orientation, 
and receive the documents and infor-
mation they need for their future court 
dates. 
Right now, in the absence of regional 
processing centers, that all takes place 
wherever the bodies come across at a 
given location along the border. That 
is what takes the Border Patrol off the 
frontlines, opening up these huge gaps 
in our border security for illegal drugs 
to come across. So the very modest 
step of creating regional processing 
centers will at least help with that. 
Second, our bill addresses staffing 
shortages that have made this situa-
tion even more challenging, and, in-
deed, that is the goal of these criminal 
organizations that move millions of 
migrants across our border. But it will 
require the hiring of hundreds of Cus-
toms and Border Protection officers 
and Border Patrol processing coordina-
tors so agents, like those I spoke of in 
Del Rio, can get back on the frontlines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8839 
December 1, 2021 
This legislation calls for 150 new im-
migration judges. Given the size of the 
backlog of the immigration docket, we 
need more help. We need 300 asylum of-
ficers, ICE litigation teams, and other 
personnel to help adjudicate asylum 
claims and work through the immigra-
tion court backlog. 
But make no doubt about it. These 
criminal organizations are smart, they 
are well organized, and they under-
stand the gaps and know how to exploit 
them. It is because they have become 
experts at exploiting the gaps, in the 
absence of any action by Congress, that 
what we have seen in this last year is 
going to continue into the foreseeable 
future. What we saw in Del Rio last 
September will be repeated at some 
point unless we change the way we 
handle these migrants. 
These are commonsense reforms, like 
I said, that have received bicameral 
and bipartisan support, which, for 10 
months, has completely bewildered the 
Biden administration. It is not a solu-
tion to every problem we are facing 
today, but it is a place to start. I would 
yield to anybody who has a better idea 
or to anybody who has any ideas at all, 
but, so far, all we hear from the Biden 
administration is crickets—pretending 
like the problem doesn’t exist and will, 
hopefully, go away. 
Meanwhile, the President’s poll num-
bers, when it comes to the border and 
illegal immigration, continue to plum-
met. You would think self-interest 
alone and the political future of the 
Democratic Party and of this adminis-
tration would cause them to wake up 
and decide: Hey, what we are doing now 
isn’t working; so let’s try something 
different. 
Well, I hope that Senate Democrats, 
who have the majority in the Senate 
and who set the agenda both here on 
the floor and in committees, will con-
sider the bipartisan-bicameral bill that 
Senator 
SINEMA
and 
Congressmen 
CUELLAR and GONZALES and I have pro-
posed. 
Only the chairman of the com-
mittee—the Judiciary Committee—can 
actually set a hearing on a bill and 
schedule a markup where we can vote 
on it, where we can offer amendments 
and shape the bill according to the will 
of the Members of the Senate. So far, 
Senator TILLIS
from North Carolina 
and I have written a letter to Senator 
DURBIN, the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, asking him to hold such a 
hearing and a markup. We are not sug-
gesting we can dictate the outcome, be-
cause every member of the Judiciary 
Committee would be able to offer any 
additional suggestions or amendments 
that they might have, but we are ask-
ing him to get off the dime, to get out 
of neutral, and actually do something 
to help improve the broken situation 
at the border. 
Senate committees used to be the 
usual place for debates on critical 
issues and legislation, but now it seems 
like the Democratic chairmen have 
ceded all of their power to the authors 
of the reckless tax-and-spending spree 
bill that has now passed the House. 
They complain about which policies 
were cut out of the latest bill without 
stopping to consider the fact that they 
could 
move 
these 
same 
policies 
through the normal committee process. 
After the Parliamentarian confirmed 
that Democrats cannot grant legal sta-
tus or citizenship through the budget 
process, the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee professed to be deeply dis-
appointed, but he wasn’t surprised. He 
knows the rules as well as anybody 
else, and it seems disingenuous to me 
to say he was deeply disappointed in 
not being able to move immigration 
law changes through a partisan budget 
reconciliation process when he himself 
has the authority to schedule a mark-
up and a hearing of a bill that would 
actually make things better. There is 
nothing that prevents Chairman DUR-
BIN from holding a hearing on these 
proposals in the Judiciary Committee 
this week. 
Make no mistake. Republicans want 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
to 
start 
working on legislation to address the 
failures of our immigration system and 
not just the border crisis. As I sug-
gested a moment ago, this summer, 
Senator TILLIS
from North Carolina 
and I asked the chairman of the com-
mittee to take up a targeted DACA 
bill, Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals, that only addresses the active 
DACA population. 
We weren’t holding these young peo-
ple who have done nothing wrong but 
find themselves now in an unstable fu-
ture because of the litigation that is 
still pending. We didn’t ask for any-
thing for that. We just asked that the 
Senate Judiciary Committee actually 
do its job by taking up a bill and vot-
ing on a piece of legislation and mak-
ing it available for floor action. 
Many of our Democratic colleagues 
have been promising the Dreamers, 
sometimes known as the DACA popu-
lation—same difference. These are peo-
ple who came across the border ille-
gally as children, but in America we 
don’t hold children responsible for the 
mistakes their parents make. There 
are many of us on our side of the aisle 
who would be happy to engage in a dis-
cussion and debate and vote on relief 
and a more stable future for these 
young people who, as I have said, did 
nothing wrong but now find themselves 
in a legal conundrum. These are the 
young men and women whose fate has 
hung in the balance of every court rul-
ing for the last 10 years, and the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee is ad-
vocating giving them legal status. 
Now he has two Republican Senators 
asking him to bring up a bill that 
achieves that goal, but he refuses, even 
went so far as to say he was dis-
appointed we asked him to do his job. 
Instead, he insists on tying the fate of 
these young people to the Democrats’ 
impossible-to-pass 
mass 
legalization 
proposal. 
Our Democratic colleagues seem to 
think this massive partisan bill is the 
only way they can prove to voters that 
they know how to govern, but they 
have got it backward. 
In reality, Democrats’ burning focus 
on this one reckless bill has kept them 
from achieving anything else, includ-
ing immigration reform. 
Our colleagues have done nothing to 
address the border crisis, so far have 
done nothing to fund the government, 
have done nothing to lift the debt ceil-
ing, have done nothing to support our 
military, and have done nothing to 
meet the Senate’s most basic respon-
sibilities. 
It is true that by virtue of a 50–50 
Senate and a Democrat Vice President 
that our Democratic colleagues control 
the majority in this body and they con-
trol a majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives and they have the White 
House. But one thing is for sure, this is 
a far cry from living up to our respon-
sibilities to govern wisely and appro-
priately for the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there 
is a lot of work to get done in this 
Chamber today and for the rest of the 
week, and Democrats are committed to 
working with the other side in good 
faith to get them done. 
First, we need to fund the govern-
ment before the December 3 deadline. 
On that front, negotiations continue on 
a bipartisan, bicameral basis, and we 
are making good progress toward pass-
ing a funding measure. 
When a CR reaches the Senate, 
Democrats are going to support it and 
work to pass it as quickly as possible. 
Our Republican colleagues, mean-
while, can either work with us to move 
the process quickly through the Cham-
ber or they can engage in obstructive 
tactics that will make a government 
shutdown almost a certainty. 
Sadly, this second option seems to be 
the path that a few on the other side 
are choosing, and I hope they see the 
light quickly and not cause a needless 
Republican government shutdown. 
If every Member of this Chamber 
used the threat of a shutdown to secure 
concessions on their own interests, 
that would lead to chaos for the mil-
lions and millions of Americans who 
rely on a functioning government. 
So I urge those Republicans who are 
thinking of poisoning this entire proc-
ess for their own items to take a step 
back. There are other arenas and op-
portunities to have a debate. In the 
meantime, we have a responsibility—a 
responsibility—to fund the government

so it can fulfill its basic duties to serve 
the American people. 
And we have a responsibility to sup-
port our troops, support their families, 
and keep Americans safe by passing 
our annual Defense bill. On that front, 
we also need bipartisan cooperation. 
H.R. 4350 
Last night, both parties ran a hotline 
in order to reach consent on holding 
floor votes on 21 amendments to the 
NDAA. This is even more amendments 
than Chairman REED
and Ranking 
Member INHOFE offered a few weeks 
ago. 
To put this proposal in historical 
context: In the first year under Presi-
dent Trump, the Senate held votes on 
22 amendments on all legislation. 
Not only that, our latest vote in-
cludes votes on the items Senator 
MCCONNELL said just yesterday were 
‘‘the only reason that [Republicans] 
pushed the pause button on this bill.’’ 
Well, it is time for Republicans to hit 
the play button. Democrats have been 
exceedingly reasonable by offering ro-
bust amendments with ample input 
from the other side of the aisle. 
Again, let me repeat, we have more 
amendments on the floor that we have 
offered on this NDAA bill than the 
total amount of amendments for 4 
years under Leader MCCONNELL on the 
NDAA bill—more here now. 
People say we are moving too quick-
ly. You know what we did on those 
bills? We sat on the floor for days with-
out doing anything. We sat on the floor 
the last few weeks getting nominations 
through, even as difficult as some oth-
ers are making it. So to sit on the floor 
and do nothing and then only do three 
amendments over 2 weeks didn’t make 
sense. 
Here we have 19 amendments—21 
amendments that we are willing to 
do—again, to repeat, more than all the 
total amendments on the four NDAA 
bills that passed in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 
2020, when MCCONNELL was leader and 
Donald Trump was President. 
So let us get to the voting today. Let 
the Republicans hit the play button. 
Democrats have been exceedingly rea-
sonable by offering robust process with 
ample input from the other side. Demo-
crats want to get this done. I know 
many on the other side want to get this 
done as well. That is good, and we will 
keep working until we have a deal to 
move forward. 
NOMINATION OF DALE HO 
Mr. President, now on Dale Ho, ear-
lier today, I had the honor to come be-
fore the Senate Judiciary Committee 
to introduce a remarkable candidate to 
sit on the Federal bench: Dale Ho, who 
I proudly recommended to President 
Biden as a nominee to the district 
court of the Southern District of New 
York. 
Mr. Ho is a graduate of Princeton, 
Yale Law School, and clerked for two 
judges, including in the same district 
court for which he has now been nomi-
nated. But it is his experience at the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund and at the 
ACLU, where he currently serves as Di-
rector of Voting Rights, where Mr. Ho 
has set himself apart as one of the best 
election and voting rights lawyers in 
America. 
He has argued two cases before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. In one, he chal-
lenged the exclusion of undocumented 
immigrants from the population count 
used to apportion the House of Rep-
resentatives. In the other, which made 
the front pages of most newspapers in 
America, he successfully challenged 
the inclusion of a citizenship question 
on the 2020 census. 
And beyond his cases before the Su-
preme Court, he also led the successful 
challenge of a Kansas law requiring 
people to show a birth certificate or 
passport when registering to vote. 
As voting rights come under assault 
across the country, it is only fitting 
that we elevate one of the country’s 
top voting rights experts to sit on the 
bench to safeguard our democracy and 
preserve our most fundamental right as 
U.S. citizens. 
Voting rights is in jeopardy. There 
could be no finer person on the bench 
than Dale Ho, one of the great experts 
in America at both understanding and 
litigating voting rights for the people. 
If confirmed, I have no doubt he will 
make an excellent Federal judge, and I 
am proud to support his nomination. 
WHITE HOUSE MENORAH LIGHTING CEREMONY 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, this evening, it will be my 
honor to join the President, Vice Presi-
dent, First Lady, and especially our 
Second 
Gentleman 
for 
the 
annual 
White House menorah lighting cere-
mony. 
This year, Hanukkah comes at a 
poignant moment not just for our 
country but for myself as well. I will be 
proud to participate at the White 
House as the first Jewish majority 
leader in history. I will join bearing in 
mind the passing of my wonderful fa-
ther. And across America, we observe 
Hanukkah after a year and a half 
marked by both loss and then renewal. 
This season is a reminder that, in the 
face of awful adversity, we cannot lose 
faith in God’s providence. In the face of 
darkness, 
Hanukkah 
teaches 
that, 
rather than curse the darkness, we 
must light a candle. 
In the story of Hanukkah, the Mac-
cabees triumphed after facing enor-
mous adversity. This year, we take 
heart from the lesson of that story. We, 
too, shall triumph over the challenges 
our country faces today. 
So as we observe the fourth night of 
Hanukkah, I want to wish my col-
leagues and the American people a 
happy Hanukkah, and I look forward to 
joining the White House for tonight’s 
candle-lighting event. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in-
flation is hammering working families 
from coast to coast, but Democrats 
want to print, borrow, and spend bil-
lions more. Our economy is already 
sputtering on their watch, but Demo-
crats want to wallop the country with 
massive tax hikes that would kill 
American jobs and discourage industry 
from locating here in our country. 
Everybody with a lick of common 
sense knows the massive, reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree that Democrats 
are writing behind closed doors is 
crazy. A supermajority of Americans— 
67 percent—say that inflation and ris-
ing costs are harming everyone in the 
country and government should cut 
back on spending and printing money 
as a result. Sixty-seven percent of the 
American people—two in three Ameri-
cans—want Washington Democrats to 
step back from the precipice—an over-
whelming consensus. 
But a few loud voices on the far left 
are yelling at Democrats to ignore the 
people and take the plunge. The sheer 
financial cost of what Democrats want 
to do to our country is literally jaw- 
dropping. 
Even when the Congressional Budget 
Office had to swallow all the Demo-
crats’ budget gimmicks and fuzzy math 
at face value, they still found that this 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
would add—listen to this—$800 billion 
to the deficit in the next 5 years; even 
with swallowing all the gimmicks, an-
other $800 billion in deficit spending 
during a time of inflation. 
But 
even 
that 
almost 
certainly 
undershoots the impact. The Demo-
crats’ legislation pretends that liberals 
will let all of these huge new entitle-
ments simply expire after a few years. 
We all know that is a total accounting 
fiction. They are marketing these new 
welfare programs as moral impera-
tives. Democrats don’t want them to 
expire, but they draft bills with these 
fake expiration dates to make it ap-
pear like it costs less. 
Outside experts have tried to esti-
mate the real cost of the bill. So listen 
to this: If all these new welfare entitle-
ments did not magically fall away 
after a few years, they say the bill 
would actually cost double—double— 
what Democrats say and leave us with 
$2.8 trillion in new debt. Nonpartisan 
experts who look past the Democrats’ 
fictional accounting and fake assump-
tions find the bill would add $2.8 tril-
lion to the deficit. 
So that is how you risk turning a 
couple years of inflation into a full-on 
lost decade—a full-on lost decade. 
But the problem with their reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree is not just 
the pricetag. It is not the case that 
Democrats have cooked up a great list 
of investments that would strengthen 
America but we just can’t afford it at

this particular moment, no. Our col-
leagues want to ram through a far-left 
wish list that would hurt families and 
help China. 
So, look, there is no grand national 
project waiting on the other side of all 
these trillions, no 21st-century version 
of the Hoover Dam or the Interstate 
Highway System or the space race, 
nothing to really make us proud; just a 
mediocre assortment of new welfare 
programs, new transfers, and new bu-
reaucratic power grabs. 
And somehow it all seems tailormade 
to take existing problems in our coun-
try and actually make them worse. 
Take, for example, the nationwide 
labor shortage facing our economy 
right now. 
One of the most vocal of the House’s 
self-styled Democratic socialists said 
last year that even after workplaces 
were once again safe, people should 
simply refuse to go back to work— 
refuse to go back to work. Forget 
science, forget economic recovery; just 
say no. 
Well, this spring, the far left got 
their wish: a massive, unnecessary 
spending package that stunted our 
comeback and literally paid people to 
stay on the sidelines. By summertime, 
unfilled positions were setting new all- 
time highs. 
Yet Washington Democrats now want 
to double down with a plan that would 
shatter a decades-old consensus about 
the link between welfare and work. 
They want to massively expand access 
to welfare, including to people in this 
country—listen to this—who are in this 
country illegally by hijacking the child 
tax credit that was designed for work-
ing families with actual tax liabilities. 
That is what the child tax credit was 
for: to help working families who had 
actual tax liabilities. 
Or look at the ongoing obsession 
with the Green New Deal policies. 
President Biden’s cave to the far-left’s 
climate agenda started on day one: 
canceling American jobs, the Keystone 
XL Pipeline, and freezing exploration 
on new sources of domestic energy. 
Last year, the United States was a 
net energy exporter. Now, on Demo-
crats’ watch, we have doubled our im-
ports of Russian oil, and American 
households are staring down an his-
toric spike in home heating costs. 
Was it time to pump the brakes on 
green radicalism? Not if you ask Wash-
ington Democrats. Their reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree would heap a 
fresh batch of fees and mandates on 
producers of the most affordable do-
mestic energy while showering incen-
tives on the pricey and unreliable al-
ternatives blue State liberals prefer. 
Pouring government subsidies into 
green pet projects like electric cars 
and solar panels would mean handing a 
massive windfall to Chinese producers 
that dominate the markets for a slew 
of the rare earth materials these prod-
ucts require. So it would hurt our fami-
lies and help China. 
Look at education. The same Demo-
crats who let their Big Labor bene-
factors rob kids of in-person schooling 
are now letting the Justice Depart-
ment of the Biden administration scru-
tinize parents who dare to question 
woke propaganda. Their reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree would go even 
further to take power and control away 
from parents. Democrats want to bring 
even more of kids’ learning, down to 
pre-K, under the thumb of woke bu-
reaucrats and Big Labor. 
Even prior to pre-K, Democrats have 
cooked up a crazy new labyrinth of reg-
ulations and subsidies and mandates 
for 
daycare. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Speaker PELOSI want to tell the Amer-
ican people how to raise their kids and 
how to structure their private family 
arrangements. These liberals want to 
take families’ most personal life deci-
sions and have Washington pick win-
ners and losers. 
So 
listen 
to 
this: 
The 
cost 
of 
childcare would actually be driven up. 
Families who have made different sets 
of sacrifices to have a parent or grand-
parent raise their young kids would get 
absolutely nothing. Oh, and listen to 
this: Many Americans’ faith-based pro-
viders would be intentionally shut out 
from important funding, and the cul-
ture warrior Secretary Becerra would 
be calling the shots. 
So it is like I said. The actual sub-
stance of their bill is as awful as the 
pricetag. Democrats’ plan wouldn’t 
just waste trillions and exacerbate in-
flation; it would also make American 
families’ lives considerably worse. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

WAUKESHA CHRISTMAS PARADE 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on 
Sunday, November 21, 2021, a Christmas 
parade in Waukesha, WI, meant to 
usher in a season of peace on Earth, 
good will toward men, turned into a 
nightmare. An 8-year-old child and 5 
adults were murdered, 62 others were 
injured. Some of the injured, including 
three children, remain in critical con-
dition, their lives forever altered. 
Families with their children who 
came to see Santa Claus, high school 
bands, the Dancing Grannies instead 
witnessed a horror that will leave life-
long psychological scars. First respond-
ers and law enforcement who rushed in 
to administer first aid and compas-
sionately deal with the tragedy will be 
burdened by their terrible memories 
for the rest of their lives. 
But as is so often the case, in the 
midst of an awful event caused by the 
worst of humanity, the absolute best of 
humanity is fully revealed. This is 
what we are witnessing in Waukesha. 
The healing process has already begun. 
It began immediately as members of 
the community came together to help 
the victims and survivors. 
The very next evening, hundreds of 
people gathered at an interfaith prayer 
vigil to pray for healing and strength. 
I had the privilege of attending that 
vigil and speaking to members of the 
community, first responders, and those 
who knew the victims. It was a moving 
experience that I will never forget— 
sorrowful and yet hopeful. 
From that experience, I have no 
doubt that the citizens of Waukesha 
will recover from this tragedy, but it 
will take time and a great deal of ef-
fort. It will also be the responsibility of 
civil society to administer justice for 
this heinous act of evil because the vic-
tims and the community of Waukesha 
deserve justice. 
Unfortunately, there is nothing we 
can do to bring back the six innocent 
lives who perished: Virginia Sorenson, 
Leanna Owen, Tamara Durand, Jane 
Kulich, Wilhelm Hospel, and Jackson 
Sparks, who was only 8 years old. 
We can pray for healing for those 
broken in both body and spirit and also 
pray for those who helped them heal. 
We can also show our support by offer-
ing a moment of silence here on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate, which I will 
ask for following the remarks of my 
colleague from Wisconsin whom I now 
yield to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, on 
Sunday, November 21, the joy and cele-
bration of Waukesha’s annual Christ-
mas parade was shattered by a horren-
dous, senseless act of violence that 
took the lives of six individuals and in-
jured scores of others. 
Immediately, 
the 
community 
re-
sponded. Waukesha police and fire-
fighters leapt into action, as did other 
first responders and so did parade- 
goers, providing aid and comfort to the 
injured and their families and those 
who witnessed such horrendous vio-
lence. They escorted some to safety. 
Many used personal vehicles to bring 
victims to area hospitals. These were 
acts of extraordinary heroism at a mo-
ment of immense tragedy. 
I, too, joined in the interfaith vigil 
the following evening, where I joined 
hundreds upon hundreds in Waukesha 
and the surrounding area. This is a 
first step of an infinite number of steps 
in both the grieving and healing proc-
ess. And while the entire vigil was 
moving in so many ways, I just remem-
ber the end where neighbor turned to 
neighbor to light their candles, and the 
light was passed on and on. 
In that night, after dusk had passed, 
the area lit up, a symbol of both hope 
and unity, as well as grief and remem-
brance. 
I want to be very clear where I stand, 
as I stand together with the Waukesha 
community. I think it is simply wrong 
and disrespectful to the innocent lives 
that were taken away for anyone to 
play politics with this horrific tragedy. 
We know this is not a political issue 
asking for division; it is a community 
standing together in unity, asking for

So we remember Wilhelm ‘‘Bill’’ 
Hospel, Virginia ‘‘Ginny’’ Sorenson, 
Leanna ‘‘Lee’’ Owen, Tamara Durand, 
Jane Kulich, and 8-year-old Jackson 
Sparks. 
I yield back to my colleague to ask 
for a moment of silence in their mem-
ory. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I now

the 
attack 
on 
the 
Waukesha Christmas parade on Novem-
ber 21, 2021. 
(Moment of silence.) 
Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, as I 
was home last week for Thanksgiving, 
traveling the State of Wyoming, talk-
ing to many folks, I heard a lot, got an 
earful from people about the Demo-
crats’ reckless tax-and-spending bill 
that is being proposed and that Sen-
ator SCHUMER has said he wants to get 
passed before Christmas. Well, if that 
is the case, it is going to be a long De-
cember. 
The people of Wyoming do not like 
this bill because they are finding out 
more and more about what is in it and 
how it is going to impact their lives. 
So I come to the floor today to talk 
about a couple of things that the 
American people have heard and the 
people in Wyoming have been tuned in 
to dramatically, and that is wanting to 
know what does it cost. 
Just before Thanksgiving, the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
released its report about the cost of the 
bill, and the report confirmed what Re-
publicans who had read through it have 
expected. It is jam-packed with phony 
accounting gimmicks, and it seems 
like the Democrats have used just 
about every trick in the book to deal 
with the true cost of the massive 
amounts of money the Democrats are 
trying to spend in this bill with one 
giveaway after another and, addition-
ally, entitlements—new entitlements 
that the country cannot afford. 
Even with all the gimmicks used, the 
spending is still hundreds of billions of 
dollars added to the debt—not just 
hundreds of billions of dollars of spend-
ing, hundreds of billions of dollars 
added to the debt. This is a violation of 
the speech that Joe Biden has given re-
peatedly, that his press people have 
said repeatedly, that the Speaker of 
the House has said repeatedly, because 
they continue to say and the President 
has said and the Secretary of the 
Treasury just yesterday said the cost 
of the bill would be zero. I can remem-
ber seeing President Biden on tele-
vision saying the cost is zero, zero, 
zero. The budget office even says it is 
hundreds of billions of dollars added to 
the debt. 
But watching this unfold, as the 
President and the Democrats have 
tried to force this bill onto the Amer-
ican public, there have been three big 
lies coming out of the President’s 
mouth repeatedly on this. One is, he 
said it would cost zero. The second, he 
said it wouldn’t raise taxes on anybody 
making less than $400,000 a year. The 
third thing, he said it wouldn’t add to 
inflation. 
Well, the President has been wrong 
on all of those. Hundreds of billions of 
dollars onto the debt—hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. It does raise taxes on 
the middle class. The budget analysts 
and the tax analysts who looked at this 
say at least one in three Americans in 
the middle-income areas will be paying 
more in taxes. And it will certainly in-
crease inflation. 
I would point out that the people at 
home are feeling the biting impacts of 
inflation. It is hitting their lives. It is 
hitting their pocketbooks. They no-
ticed it over the Thanksgiving holiday. 
People in Wyoming are going to the 
gas station to fill up their truck, and it 
is $100—$100 dollars every time you fill 
up. 
People drive great distances to work 
in Wyoming. I think we are the State 
that has the most miles driven, aver-
age, for any State over the course of a 
year, more miles driven in Wyoming by 
Wyoming residents, so we know what 
happens when gas prices go up a dollar 
and a quarter. 
Prices are up at the store as well, up 
a dollar and a quarter at the grocery 
store. I don’t know if you know that 
the Dollar Tree store has actually 
changed it to a dollar and a quarter for 
what they are charging for things. 
That is what we are getting under 
this administration with its reckless 
positions and policies. 
Yesterday, the Treasury Secretary, 
at the Banking Committee, said that 
this would not add to the debt. You 
know, the American people don’t be-
lieve it. Poll after poll says the Presi-
dent is not being honest with them, in 
their opinion. That is what they are 
seeing, and the budget report confirms 
it. The American people do not want 
more debt, more taxes, and more 
spending which results in higher costs 
for them. 
When the President said it wouldn’t 
actually raise taxes on people making 
up to $400,000 a year, there are the di-
rect taxes, which the budget analysts 
point out to us, but there are also the 
taxes that are going to be raised by the 
IRS fund, putting the American people 
under the microscope, because in this 
bill that the Democrats are proposing, 
it super-sizes the Internal Revenue 
Service to go after American taxpayers 
to try to squeeze more money out of 
honest people so they can spend it on 
things like five new entitlements for il-
legal immigrants. The bill would near-
ly double the size of the IRS, and the 
money is going to enforcement. 
Now let’s talk about some of the tax 
breaks that are in this. Who is going to 
benefit the most with tax cuts that are 
actually in the bill? Because the Presi-
dent says there are tax cuts in it. Well, 
there are. NANCY PELOSI’s California— 
the millionaires there benefit a lot. 
People of New York benefit a lot. Peo-
ple of New Jersey benefit a lot. The 
millionaires in those three States will 
see significant cuts in their taxes, as 
middle-income people pay more, which 
gets us to the third big concern about 
what the President is continuing to say 
to the American people, which is where 
he says that it will not add to infla-
tion. 
People can see through this. They see 
what they are paying. They see that in-
flation is coming. 
I would note that yesterday, the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve said 
that this idea about temporary infla-
tion is wrong. Oh, no—here to stay. 
People get it, and they don’t like it. 
They don’t like it when they are think-
ing about what is going to happen if 
they are trying to shop for Christmas. 
Can they get what they want to buy, 
and what is it going to cost? 
Well, the President has said that 17 
Nobel laureates said the bill wouldn’t 
add to inflation. But then his com-
ments were fact-checked, as so many 
things we say are fact-checked, and 
what those economists, 
the 
Nobel 
economists, actually said was that it 
wouldn’t add to inflation if the bill 
were fully paid for, and it is not, be-
cause the budget officials have pointed 
out that the bill is going to add hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to the debt. 
As I started this, I talked about the 
fact that I was home for Thanksgiving. 
Well, this Thanksgiving has been the 
most expensive ever for the American 
people, and people are now really wor-
ried about what is going to happen 
come Christmas. 
The price of gas is at a 7-year high. 
Natural gas is at a 7-year high. It is 
getting colder. Winter is here. What is 
going to happen with heating costs? 
Hard to believe that in just 10 
months as President, Joe Biden has 
taken inflation to a 30-year high. Ac-
cording to one estimate, families are 
paying about $175 more each month be-
cause 
of 
inflation 
since 
President 
Biden took office. That is about a $2,000 
bite out of the paychecks for every 
working American over a year. 
Now, it is interesting, when you kind 
of dig into the meat of what is in this 
bill, the Democrats want to make en-
ergy even more expensive than it is 
now. So if we are at a 7-year high for 
the cost of gasoline and a 7-year high 
for the cost of natural gas, what is

going to happen when the new taxes 
and regulations on American energy go 
into effect at a time when President 
Biden is begging Russia, Vladimir 
Putin, and Saudi Arabia to produce 
more oil to sell it to us? It is a jackpot 
for Putin. That is what we have—Joe 
Biden’s jackpot payday for Vladimir 
Putin at the expense of the American 
people. So there are families who are 
going to have to decide this winter 
whether they are going to be able to af-
ford to eat or to heat their homes. 
The Democrats’ tax-and-spending bill 
is going to raise taxes across the board, 
and a lot of it is aimed at small busi-
nesses, mom-and-pop operations. What 
are they going to do with the taxes 
that come at them? Well, of course, 
they are going to pass them on to the 
customers. What is that going to do to 
the cost when the customer comes in? 
The cost is going to go up, and there-
fore you have inflation. 
Another part of what the Democrats 
are proposing, which will make infla-
tion worse, is they are going to in-
crease 
government 
spending. 
More 
spending. More debt. More printing of 
money by the Federal Reserve. More 
dollars facing fewer goods. Prices will 
go up. 
One of the things that we are start-
ing to hear about as people learn more 
about it is the increased cost of 
childcare under the President’s pro-
posal, by about $13,000 per family. 
Look, this is already a huge expense 
for working families, but the bill could 
nearly double it. That is because it in-
cludes a Federal takeover of childcare 
in America. 
In total, the bill would create more 
than 150 new government programs. It 
is interesting that it uses the words 
‘‘tax,’’ ‘‘fee,’’ and ‘‘penalty’’ 637 times. 
When the President said Build Back 
Better, I looked at this as a bill that is 
going to break the back of American 
families 637 times—tax, fee, penalty. 
From top to bottom, this bill is a laun-
dry list of more taxes, more debt, more 
government control over our lives. The 
people of Wyoming do not like it and 
do not want it. This is not what the 
American people are asking for. They 
don’t like its content; they don’t like 
its cost; and the more they learn about 
it, the less they like it. 
It is interesting because the day after 
the budget office came out with their 
report, the Democrats rushed the bill 
through the House, saying: We have 
got to get this through here before peo-
ple see what is in it. Every Republican 
is united against it. Every Republican 
voted against it in the House, and actu-
ally, there was a Democrat who voted 
against it as well. So the opposition is 
bipartisan. 
Now, the bill comes to the Senate. 
Here we are. I promise you it will hit a 
buzz saw of resistance from Repub-
licans in this body. 
So Democrats in the Senate have to 
make a decision. As people in our 
States struggle to pay for Christmas, 
the Democrats who are pushing this 
reckless proposal have to decide wheth-
er or not they want to ignore the suf-
fering that has been created by this ad-
ministration with increased prices, by 
causing prices to go up even higher as 
well as taxes to go up as well. 
The American people know that 
President Biden has not been truthful 
with them about the bill—about what 
he has said about the cost, about what 
he has said about taxes, about what he 
has said about inflation. Poll after poll 
says they don’t believe him because 
they know the bill is going to add hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to the debt; 
they know it is going to raise taxes on 
the middle class; and they know it is 
going to make the pain of inflation 
even worse. 
If Democrats pass this bill, everyone 
in this country will end up paying for 
it, one way or another. 
The last thing the American people 
need for Christmas is higher taxes, 
more debt, and higher prices. The last 
thing the American people are asking 
for is this reckless tax and spending. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Mississippi. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise this afternoon in support of the 
freedom-loving people of Ukraine, our 
friends and our allies in Europe, and in 
warning to my fellow Americans, to 
my colleagues, about a threat coming 
from Vladimir Putin’s Russian regime. 
I rise in support of this American ally 
whose right to democracy is being 
threatened. Its right to self-determina-
tion is being threatened. And I rise at 
this moment, when there are negotia-
tions going on in this building between 
Republicans and Democrats as to how 
to urge the President of the United 
States to respond to a buildup of 90,000 
to 100,000 Russian troops on the border 
of this sovereign country who is our 
ally. 
The world has watched in recent 
weeks not understanding, not knowing 
what Vladimir Putin has in mind. But 
there is no question about it, there is 
the amassing of troops. They are mov-
ing in place all the supplies and troops 
it would need if they decide to launch 
an invasion of this Member of the 
United Nations, of this Member of the 
Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe, this sovereign nation 
who wants self-determination. 
Our Ukrainian friends are sounding 
the alarm. They warned us that Russia 
could be ready to invade their country 
by land, air, or sea as early as next 
month or February of 2022. I heard 
their concerns along with a bipartisan 
delegation of Senators who attended 
the 
Halifax 
International 
Security 
Conference just a couple of weeks ago 
in Nova Scotia. 
These are concerns that were voiced 
today at a bureau meeting of the Par-
liamentary Assembly of the Organiza-
tion for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe. The threats are serious. The 
troops are there on the border of 
Ukraine, and we have a right to be wor-
ried and mindful about Mr. Putin’s lat-
est move in his long campaign to un-
dermine Ukraine’s freedom and sov-
ereignty. 
We should never forget what hap-
pened in 2014, when troops that he dis-
avowed but were clearly under his di-
rection invaded the Ukrainian terri-
tory of Crimea. Since then, Russia has 
provoked a shooting war in Eastern 
Ukraine which has cost the lives of 
more than 13,000 people. More than 
13,000 human beings have died because 
of the war Vladimir Putin has caused 
Russia to make against the people of 
Ukraine. 
Moscow tries to deny and obfuscate 
the truth, but the world knows the 
truth. The OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly plainly spoke overwhelmingly 
in a resolution that Russia had vio-
lated every precept of the final agree-
ment of the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation. 
Now is the time—and I know many of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle agree with this—now is the time 
for the President of the United States 
to send a strong signal to Vladimir 
Putin and his oligarchs, his ruling 
inner circle, that there will be serious 
consequences not so much for the Rus-
sian people, there will be serious con-
sequences for Mr. Putin and his hench-
men on day 1 if he goes ahead with this 
invasion—on day 1. 
And it troubles me to hear that our 
friends on the Democratic side of the 
aisle and my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle would like to 
pass an amendment on the NDAA that 
makes this clear and sends a clear mes-
sage that on day 1, sanctions will be 
imposed by our Chief Executive—by 
the Commander in Chief of our Armed 
Forces—and yet we are stuck on lan-
guage that might have unintended con-
sequences. 
The purpose of my statement this 
afternoon is to urge the leaders of the 
Armed Services Committee, of the For-
eign Relations Committee, on both 
sides of the aisle, to get together and 
get the language right so we make it 
clear what our consequences will be on 
Nord Stream 2. I think Nord Stream 2 
should be disallowed on day 1 when 
Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. And I 
think we can stop this. 
I don’t want a war with Ukraine and 
neither do my colleagues and neither 
does the President of the United 
States. The clearest way to prevent an 
invasion of our friends in Ukraine is for 
the United States to stand strong, to 
be resolute, to send a signal to the 
world that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine will not be tolerated and that 
intolerable consequences will be meted 
out upon the Putin regime if this takes 
place. 
We are not where we need to be on 
the language. There are negotiations, 
and I am hopeful the NDAA will be on 
the floor for amendments. But the way 
it is positioned right now, is that a 
Democratic amendment will be offered,

and it will not pass because we think 
there are holes in it. A Republican 
amendment will be offered on Ukraine 
on sanctions. It will not pass because, 
for some reason, the White House be-
lieves it is improper or inadequate. 
This doesn’t have to happen when a 
clear majority of this body wants to 
send a strong signal to Mr. Putin. 
I hope that happens, and I urge that 
on the leadership of this Senate and on 
the leaders of these two very important 
committees. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, yesterday, in a hearing before the 
Senate Banking Committee, the Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell 
finally confirmed what we have all 
known for a long time; that the threat 
of persistently higher inflation has 
grown and that the risk of more per-
sistent inflation has risen. 
He acknowledged to the committee 
that use of the word ‘‘transitory’’ in 
the media has caused confusion and 
that it is probably a good time to re-
tire that word and try to explain more 
clearly what is actually happening 
with the economy. 
Now, that is bad news for the spin 
doctors over in the Biden administra-
tion who have spent months trying to 
convince Tennesseans and the Amer-
ican people that we will be out of the 
woods any day now, that this is all 
coming to a fast end. It is back to the 
drawing board for the White House 
comms shop. They cannot split hairs 
over vocabulary words pertaining to in-
flation. 
The inflation that we are seeing is 
real; it is felt; and the consequences of 
ignoring this are very real. 
Of course, Tennesseans could have 
told Washington, DC, this long ago. 
Out in the real world, they have been 
dealing with the cost of inflation. Con-
trary to what the White House would 
have you believe, inflation isn’t just a 
problem for the rich, and it certainly 
won’t fade into the background after 
the holidays. 
I have spoken at length about how 
inflation has affected Tennessee fami-
lies and their budgets. Just a few 
weeks ago, I used the price hike on 
your average Thanksgiving dinner as 
an example of how a dollar here and a 
dollar there can add up to a massive 
grocery bill that we wouldn’t have 
thought possible even a year ago. 
But when I tell you that Tennesseans 
are worried about inflation, I don’t 
want you to think they are only wor-
ried about the little extras. It is a help-
ful visualization, but it is a serious 
issue. This isn’t about the price of tur-
key. This is about an out-of-control ad-
ministration pursuing an agenda that 
has forced families to choose between 
food and fuel. 
This is beyond out of touch. It is in-
tentional, reckless activism that start-
ed the very moment that President 
Biden walked into the Oval Office, sat 
down at the desk, pulled out a pen, and 
started to sign Executive orders, begin-
ning with killing the Keystone Pipe-
line. 
If we forgot everything we know 
about the modern Democratic Party, it 
would be easy to write off the adminis-
tration’s pursuit of big spending pack-
ages as politics as usual, but we know 
and have known for a long time, actu-
ally, that the Democrats in power view 
the next few years as an opportunity to 
tear down what we have and rebuild 
this country in their own socialist 
image. That is right. Radically trans-
forming the country, that has been 
their goal for more than a decade. 
Now, this is not just bad economic 
policy; it is a full-blown power grab. 
How else could you possibly explain the 
administration’s commitment to the 
idea that we can spend our way out of 
this current crisis in spite of the moun-
tains of evidence there to the contrary? 
How else can you explain their deci-
sion to respond to collapsing supply 
chains with a vaccine mandate that we 
knew was going to make these bottle-
necks worse? 
It only makes sense if you abandon 
the assumption of good faith, and that 
is truly a disheartening revelation. 
The American people are vulnerable, 
and they are angrier than I have ever 
seen them become. They are angry be-
cause this administration’s motivation 
for pursuing these reckless policies is 
coming into focus. 
As a Tennessean told me yesterday, 
‘‘I 
supported 
President 
Biden. 
I 
thought he was going to be a moderate, 
and I feel like he became something 
else immediately.’’ 
The people know with absolute cer-
tainty that their President and his al-
lies in Congress are taking advantage 
to force us down a path that the people 
have consistently rejected. 
This is not what they want. They feel 
like they have lost control of the coun-
try, and they have no faith that the 
leaders of the Democratic Party here 
in Washington, DC, have their best in-
terests at heart. 
The American people deserve better 
than this. This is not what they voted 
for. This is not what they wanted to 
see. The White House and congres-
sional Democrats must abandon this 
disastrous Build Back Broke agenda 
before the possibility of true recovery 
slips away from us and before the 
American people lose all faith in those 
who asked for and then squandered the 
privilege of leading this country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2842 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I was 
going to give a speech first. I am now 
going to invert the order and do my 
unanimous consent request first in def-
erence to my friend and colleague, the 
Senator from Rhode Island. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Armed 
Services be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 2842 and that the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I object. 
I also want to thank the Senator 
from Utah for his consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, our 
Armed Forces have been asked to work 
miracles over the last 18 months. Dur-
ing a global pandemic, in the face of 
natural disasters, and facing dangerous 
missions, our men and women in uni-
form have risen to the challenge just as 
they have so many times throughout 
our history. Many of our servicemem-
bers have contracted and then recov-
ered from COVID. Now these heroes— 
the same heroes—are being placed in a 
corner by this administration. 
President Biden’s COVID vaccine re-
quirement for the Armed Forces does 
not grant our soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
and marines the respect that they de-
serve. As the Senate debates our an-
nual National Defense Authorization 
Act, it would be a huge mistake not to 
consider this mandate’s impact on our 
retention and recruitment of service-
members and, thus, on our military’s 
readiness to secure our national secu-
rity. 
This mandate, tied with President 
Biden’s more sweeping general vaccine 
mandate, is something that, in com-
bination, has put millions of Ameri-
cans in so many difficult, untenable, 
unfair positions. In most cases, these 
are hard-working, everyday Americans. 
They are mothers and fathers, hus-
bands and wives who are just trying to 
put food on the table during difficult 
economic times. These mandates are 
forcing millions of our fellow citizens 
into second-class, unemployable status, 
placing countless of our neighbors on 
the economic and social fringes of our 
society, even more than what they 
were already experiencing with ramp-
ant inflation caused by excessive gov-
ernment spending to the tune of tril-
lions of dollars. 
Now, I have heard from hundreds of 
Utahns, in recent days, who are con-
cerned about losing their jobs—losing 
their jobs not just in general, not just 
in the abstract, but specifically due to 
these mandates. Some of these individ-
uals are heroic members of our mili-
tary. These servicemembers were right-
ly praised for serving during a pan-
demic and serving in dangerous condi-
tions, on dangerous missions, but now 
they are being forced out, often with 
limited or no retirement benefits be-
cause of the President’s mandate. 
Let me share with you just a few of 
their stories. 
One soldier told me his story. He has 
been in the Army now for 18 years—

nearly two decades. He never received a 
single reprimand, whether written or 
otherwise. He honorably and proudly 
served his Nation. All along, he was 
planning on retiring upon reaching two 
decades of service. He is almost there 
at 18 years—just 18 months shy, in fact, 
of reaching that really important mile-
stone in his career. Now, because of the 
vaccine mandate, he is at risk of losing 
his benefits and of not even receiving 
an honorable discharge. 
Regarding his situation, he said: 
‘‘This will cause a substantial loss in 
pay and quality of life for myself and a 
large number of others I know.’’ 
Another soldier who reached out to 
my office has served for 10 years in the 
military. He has been informed, despite 
his many years of successful, faithful 
Active-Duty service, that he will not 
receive an honorable discharge if he de-
clines to comply with the vaccine re-
quirement. Accordingly, he asked to 
resign from the military. Now, his 
commanders made clear that he would 
be barred from resignation. He sought 
a personal religious exemption. He was 
summarily told his exemption request 
would be denied. 
Of his situation, he said: ‘‘To be 
backed into a corner with two very bad 
options is both disheartening and sad, 
especially with what I have sacrificed 
and what my family has sacrificed on 
behalf of the military.’’ 
Another soldier reached out to my of-
fice in a similar situation. This soldier 
has children who experienced complica-
tions with receiving the vaccine. This 
soldier also has a child with significant 
learning disabilities, whom he is wor-
ried about providing for. 
He said: 
This really could be a life-changing event 
for my family, and I feel strongly enough 
about it that I will risk all my benefits not 
to take it. I just wish I had a choice. 
These stories are just barely scratch-
ing the surface of the countless thou-
sands of servicemembers in similar po-
sitions. 
The 
Department 
of 
Defense 
has 
begun prohibiting unvaccinated mem-
bers of the National Guard from receiv-
ing Federal pay or benefits. These 
guardsmen risk being marked absent 
from training drills if they are not vac-
cinated. This move has the effect of 
pushing the unvaccinated out of the 
National Guard. Approximately 10,000 
marines remain unvaccinated. That is 
around 6 percent of the Corps. Losing 
these 
capable 
servicemembers 
and 
showing unvaccinated Americans that 
they should not join our Armed Forces 
makes our military less capable. It 
threatens its ability to do what only 
the military can do. In total, there are 
reports 
of 
approximately 
60,000 
unvaccinated servicemembers who risk 
discharge under less than honorable 
conditions due to this mandate—60,000. 
The Department of Defense, for its 
part, refuses to provide the number of 
servicemembers who have applied for 
vaccine exemptions, but there are re-
ports that even some of the few Ameri-
cans in military uniform who have re-
ceived exemptions are seeing those ex-
emptions revoked. That is chilling to 
say the least. Relatively few of them 
are getting them granted, and some of 
those who have had them granted are 
seeing them revoked. Now, these serv-
icemembers, like millions of other 
Americans whose employments have 
also been put at risk, all deserve a bet-
ter option. 
That is why, today, I am asking that 
the Senate pass my Respecting Our 
Servicemembers Act. That is why I 
came to the Senate floor and why, a 
few moments ago, I asked unanimous 
consent that we pass it. I know not ev-
eryone is going to agree on every issue 
here and that we are not going to 
agree, perhaps, on every issue per-
taining to the mandate, but I think we 
at least ought to be able to agree on 
this one. We ought not to be mis-
treating those upon whom our safety 
depends. 
This bill that I brought forward to 
try to pass today would prohibit the 
Secretary of Defense from requiring 
COVID vaccination for our military. I 
am grateful to my colleagues Senators 
BRAUN and TUBERVILLE for joining me. 
This is now the 18th time I have come 
to the Senate floor, asking that the 
Federal Government take a tempered, 
reasoned approach—an approach that 
is noticeably absent from that which 
the President has chosen to pursue. 
As I have said every time I have done 
this, I am not anti-vaccine. I believe 
the development of the COVID vaccines 
is something of a medical miracle. I am 
vaccinated, my family is vaccinated, 
and I have encouraged everyone around 
me to get the vaccine. I have also ac-
knowledged that it is not my decision, 
and it is certainly not a decision that 
should be forced on them by the Fed-
eral Government and certainly not by 
a single person acting within the Fed-
eral Government who shouldn’t be ex-
ercising that authority unilaterally. 
Whether or not vaccines should be 
mandated by the Federal Government 
is, of course, an entirely different, free- 
standing question. Our military serv-
icemembers deserve the right to make 
this medical decision for themselves 
without the threat of losing the ability 
to care for themselves and provide for 
their families. They currently face 
being forced out of the military—out of 
military service and also out of the 
benefits that they have earned. To add 
insult to injury, they are also threat-
ened with the risk of a less than honor-
able discharge, all for the supposed 
grave sin of deviating—of daring to de-
viate—from Presidential, medical or-
thodoxy. 
We are better than this. This is not 
something we should be doing. Every-
one knows it. Deep down, we know it is 
wrong. You know, according to a re-
cent Axios poll, only 14 percent of the 
American people agree with President 
Biden’s 
apparent 
assumption 
that 
someone should be fired as a con-
sequence of declining to get the vac-
cine. That is wrong. That is why I came 
here today. That is why I will be back 
as many times and as long as it takes 
to end these mandates. 
It is unfortunate that this legisla-
tion, which should be easy to pass, 
wasn’t able to pass today. It is unfortu-
nate that it drew an objection. The 
American people don’t want this, and 
our national security is undermined by 
it. I find that most unfortunate, and I 
will continue to fight it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, this morning, the Supreme Court 
heard arguments about whether it is 
constitutional for Mississippi to ban 
abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. 
This is by far the biggest threat to Roe 
v. Wade in almost three decades. 
I am here today to sound the alarm 
and call on my colleagues to stand 
with me to protect the health of Amer-
ica’s women. 
There is every reason to think that 
extreme Justices on the Supreme Court 
are poised to either overturn Roe or fa-
tally undermine it. If the Supreme 
Court gets rid of Roe, which has been 
the law of the land for five decades, 
each 
individual 
State 
will 
decide 
whether to let women control their 
own bodies and their own lives. 
Without Roe, abortion will be imme-
diately illegal in about 12 States, and 
more than a dozen others will likely 
put severe abortion restrictions in 
place. It is even possible that a future 
Republican Congress would try to re-
strict abortion nationally. 
Now, you know reproductive rights 
have been protected for so long in the 
United States that it has been easy for 
us to forget what happens when we 
don’t safeguard them. But when women 
cannot control what reproductive care 
they receive, their health suffers—their 
physical, 
emotional, 
and 
economic 
health—and the health and welfare of 
their entire families. 
We can see that now in Texas, where 
a new law creates incentives for vigi-
lantes to pry into their neighbors’ lives 
by letting anyone sue who would aid 
and abet abortions and get a $10,000 re-
ward for doing so. 
Texas doctors have reported that 
they are afraid to give essential med-
ical advice to women at risk of life- 
threatening 
complications 
in 
their 
pregnancies. One woman in Texas was 
even refused care for an ectopic preg-
nancy, which cannot be carried to term 
and must be terminated to save the pa-
tient’s life. 
Women seek access to reproductive 
care for all kinds of reasons—reasons

that are personal and intimate and 
sometimes heartbreaking. And Ameri-
cans understand this. They get it. 
Three out of every four of us, including 
the vast majority of Nevadans, agree 
that the people who should be making 
decisions about pregnancies are women 
and their doctors. 
It is unthinkable to me, then, that 
the Court is on the verge of taking that 
decision away from women and medical 
professionals and giving it to politi-
cians instead. 
If Roe v. Wade is overturned, nearly 
half of women nationwide will see the 
nearest clinic close. The average dis-
tance 
to 
the 
nearest 
reproductive 
healthcare clinic will go up by more 
than 10 times, from 25 miles to 279 
miles. 
Now, if you have ever worked for 
minimum wage, you know that taking 
days to travel across State lines for 
healthcare is a luxury that many 
Americans can’t afford. That is reality 
for many low-income women, including 
women of color. 
We have to stop treating women’s 
healthcare as optional. 
In Nevada—and I say to the Presiding 
Officer, you know this better than any-
one in the Senate—we have worked 
hard to protect reproductive health. In 
the nineties, we passed a ballot initia-
tive to enshrine choice into law. 
More recently, in Nevada, we have 
done away with the kind of restrictions 
on abortion that are popping up in 
State after State. But make no mis-
take, as long as there are active efforts 
to eliminate the right to choose, 
whether in the courts or in Congress, 
the reproductive freedom of women ev-
erywhere is in jeopardy. 
We must do everything we can to 
protect a woman’s right to choose. 
That is why it is so vital that Congress 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. This bill would outlaw bans and 
other medically unnecessary restric-
tions on abortion across the country. It 
would mean that States could not im-
pose 
medically 
unnecessary 
ultrasounds, excessive waiting periods, 
and 
other 
extreme 
burdens 
on 
healthcare providers intended to limit 
abortion access. It would guarantee 
women control over their reproductive 
decisions, in consultation with medical 
professionals. 
Now, that is what three-quarters of 
us think is right. I will do everything I 
can in the Senate to protect women in 
Nevada and across this country, and I 
would hope that our colleagues would 
join us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. 
BOOKER. 
Madam 
President, 
today should not be a normal day. 
Today should be a day of national grief 
and pain and horror at what happened 
yesterday. 
Yesterday, in Oxford, MI, there was 
yet another school shooting. Within 
the span of just 5 minutes, four chil-
dren were shot dead by a fellow stu-
dent; seven more people—six students 
and one teacher—were wounded. 
Reports are that more than 100 9–1–1 
calls were made in the span of minutes. 
Imagine the horror, imagine the fear, 
imagine the terror, imagine the pleas 
for help on those 9–1–1 calls as students 
listened to gunshot after gunshot ring 
out, killing their fellow students. The 
students huddled in corners as their 
teachers desperately tried to lock 
doors, barricading them with desks, 
fearful of what was happening out-
side—some escaping through windows 
and sprinting and running for safety. 
And what should outrage every single 
American is that this is not unusual in 
our country. This was not a one-time 
occurrence. We know the names—that 
should be hallowed names of pride—of 
our children, but, no, they are names 
that speak to horror when we think 
about Parkland and what happened 
there, when we think about Newtown 
and what happened there, and so many 
other communities that have been 
ripped apart by that nightmare that 
happened yesterday. 
We live in a distraught present in 
America. More people have died in my 
lifetime from gun violence than have 
died in all of our American wars com-
bined—from the Revolutionary War to 
the Civil War, to World War I and II, 
and Vietnam and the 20-year war on 
terror. More have died in gun violence 
in just the last 50 years. 
Our gun murder rate is 25 times high-
er than the next closer country—not 
double, not triple, not quadruple, but 
25 times more high than the next clos-
est country. And 90 Americans are 
dying every day from gun violence, not 
to mention the many more like the 
seven from Oxford, MI, who have had 
their health shattered by gunshot 
wounds tearing through their bodies. 
And our kids, our American children. 
According to Everytown for Gun Safe-
ty, firearms are the leading cause of 
death 
for 
American 
children 
and 
teens—the No. 1 cause of death. We 
know that teens are dying at alarming 
rates due to gun violence and suicide 
rates, which are rising faster and faster 
than in any other group, near an all- 
time high. 
So the question that I must ask 
today—the urgent question that we 
must ask is: What will be our response? 
We cannot keep telling our children 
that we will protect you and then the 
only thing we are doing throughout our 
schools is teaching them how to hide— 
these drills that are now as common as 
fire drills, that are teaching our chil-
dren that we won’t stop the gun vio-
lence but we are going to teach you 
how to barricade yourself in, how to 
hide under desks, how to shelter for 
cover if someone comes through your 
school that should never have had a 
gun in the first place. 
I am tired of hearing the simple ut-
terance of ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ but 
there being no action. I am a person of 
faith, and I know, as it teaches, that 
faith without works is dead. And we 
have seen enough death. 
But now, after what happened in Ox-
ford, what will be our response? 
My Republican colleagues in the Sen-
ate seem content with the status quo. 
There doesn’t seem to be an urgency to 
save lives, to end the nightmare, to 
stop the fear and terror—the continued 
work to block compromise gun safety 
laws that the majority of Americans, 
including most Republican voters, in-
cluding most gun owners, including 
most NRA members—blocking com-
promise laws that are supported by the 
majority of us Americans that would 
keep more guns out of the hands of 
people that would do our children 
harm. 
What is our response? 
We can pass universal background 
checks that are supported by 84 percent 
of voters. We can provide resources and 
support to help cities across America 
implement evidence-based gun violence 
intervention, proven programs that 
keep our children safe. 
We can start to heal the communities 
that have been shattered by gun vio-
lence 
by 
not 
just 
expressing 
our 
thoughts and prayers but investing in 
their healing and their help. 
It is no longer acceptable to have a 
culture of fear of gun violence in our 
country. It is no longer acceptable to 
teach our children just to hide while 
we do nothing. It is not acceptable that 
we are normalizing gun violence in our 
country at rates that have never before 
been seen in humanity. 
This is not normal. It demands a re-
sponse. And what will be our response? 
Now is the time not to surrender to 
fear. Now is the time not to accept this 
as normal. Now is not the time just for 
thoughts and prayers. It is the time to 
act. It is time to lift our voices to take 
more collective responsibility, to stand 
up to the corporate gun lobby. 
It is time to work tirelessly to show 
our children that love is a demanding, 
active verb; love is sacrifice. And if we 
are willing to truly love our children, 
we won’t just teach them fear; we will 
show them our strength. 
Are we going to wait? 
This is a cancer, and it is spreading. 
It is being seen in cities and churches 
and synagogues and nightclubs, con-
certs. 
Are we going to wait? 
Is there such a poverty of empathy 
that gun violence has to visit upon us, 
our communities, our schools, our 
places of worship, our families before 
we think this is an issue enough for us 
to stand up and fight for change? 
Will we wait? What will be our re-
sponse? How many more times will 
Members of this body have to come to 
this floor and speak to the unspeak-
able, talk about children murdered in

the greatest nation on the planet 
Earth, to know that our children’s 
greatest threat to their lives, their top 
cause of death is gun violence? 
I pray. I do have thoughts and pray-
ers not just for the victims but for this 
body. I hope more will join together 
not in a do-nothing caucus but join to-
gether to pass laws that reflect the will 
and the majority of the American peo-
ple and end this national nightmare 
once and for all. 
This is a moment that demands a re-
sponse, not business as usual. This is a 
moment that demands the best of who 
we are, not to cower in fear but to 
stand for change. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
it is typical for commentators to talk 
about how China is no longer really a 
communist nation. Of course, only the 
most ardent China apologist would 
question that China is still a one- 
party, authoritarian state. It is just 
that the economic policies pursued 
since the early 1980s are hard to square 
with Marxism-Leninism. 
I want to say to everybody: Not so 
fast. The sixth plenary session of the 
Central Committee of the Chinese 
Communist Party contained a brand 
new historical resolution. This is only 
the third such paper since the founding 
of the Chinese Communist Party. The 
first, historians will remember, was 
when Mao Zedong put out one in 1945, 
and the second one was Deng Xiaoping 
in 1981. 
Now, revising the historical nar-
rative has been used in the past to set 
a stage for a whole new era in China 
and a whole new era for the Communist 
Party. Most China watchers see this 
paper as a consolidation of power by 
the General Secretary of the Chinese 
Communist Party, Xi Jingping. But to 
what end does he pursue? His rhetoric 
sounds more like Mao than the Chinese 
leader—any Chinese leader since Deng 
Xiaoping. General Secretary Xi’s his-
torical resolution reads as a break 
from China’s economic policies—what 
we thought was moving towards a free 
market system since the 1980s, and 
until the last few years, I would say it 
was moving towards a free market sys-
tem. But it is too late to turn back 
now, right? Well, don’t be so sure. The 
Soviet Union pursued its New Eco-
nomic Policy as a short-term effort to 
strengthen the state before returning 
to a more pure Marxism. 
In a similar vein, General Secretary 
Xi has been cracking down on non- 
state-owned businesses, giving seem-
ingly no care to the cost to the Chinese 
economy. General Secretary Xi’s re-
cent policies reportedly wiped out up 
to $1 trillion in stock value. He is doing 
this under the banner of so-called 
‘‘common prosperity,’’ giving a social-
ist ideology backbone to what seems to 
be a power play to put him in a posi-
tion of forever, the rest of his life, gov-
erning China. 
American businesses need to pay at-
tention to all this. Even if they don’t 
care about the slave labor camp full of 
Uighurs, even if they don’t care about 
the suppression of democracy in Hong 
Kong, if our business leaders don’t care 
about China’s increasingly aggressive 
military posture—even willing to look 
the other way to China’s stealing intel-
lectual property and trade secrets— 
considering all that for American busi-
ness over there, I would urge extreme 
caution to any business that still sees 
the Chinese market as a cash cow. 
Many people thought China would be-
come very democratic once it was suf-
ficiently 
capitalist. 
Maybe 
General 
Secretary Xi is worried about just 
that—being too capitalistic, making 
too many people successful without the 
help of the government. So if anyone 
thinks 
that 
General 
Secretary 
Xi 
would not dare sacrifice economic 
growth in the pursuit of power, think 
again. 
Emerging market funds with a lot of 
exposure to China ought to think about 
rebalancing. Pension funds that are 
overexposed to the Chinese market are 
risking wiping out the retirement sav-
ings of American workers, just like we 
have seen so far—$1 trillion less value 
in Chinese stocks because of General 
Secretary Xi’s policies. 
My advice, then, to American busi-
ness is that China is not a safe bet— 
surely, not the safe bet that many 
American businessmen thought it was. 
So a little bit of advice: Anyone invest-
ing in China ought to go in with open 
eyes and a big tolerance for risk as 
long as General Secretary Xi goes down 
this line of accumulating political 
power and not caring about destroying 
what private sector is left there. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll.

dent, I ask unanimous consent that the

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3263 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3263 and the Senate then proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, this bill is 
yet another attempt by our Republican 
colleagues to stoke fear about the mi-
grations we are seeing at the southern 
border 
rather 
than 
work 
collabo-
ratively with us to actually address the 
issue and their stated concerns. 
For a decade now, we have seen in-
creasing arrivals at the southern bor-
der, especially of vulnerable popu-
lations. I am talking about families 
and unaccompanied children, many 
who are fleeing horrific conditions in 
their home countries, such as gang vio-
lence, drug trafficking, corruption, a 
global health pandemic, or the dev-
astating effects of climate change, if 
not a multitude of these dangers. It is 
unsafe for many of them to remain in 
their countries, and so they make the 
arduous journey to the United States 
to seek asylum and, heaven forbid, a 
better future. 
Asylum seekers aren’t just seeking a 
better life; they are simply trying to 
not die or to not be killed. Too many 
policymakers act like asylum seekers 
are simply choosing to come here, but, 
given the horrific conditions in their 
home countries, it is really no choice 
at all. So I am deeply disappointed to 
see Republicans in both the House and 
the Senate distorting these desperate 
young children and families at the bor-
der into some sort of threat to our Na-
tion. 
Responsibly addressing migration re-
quires going beyond partisan finger- 
pointing. We must, instead, thought-
fully address the root causes of migra-
tion and reform our border to ensure 
an orderly, secure, and well-managed 
process that treats migrants fairly and 
humanely. I have been frustrated that, 
despite numerous—and I mean numer-
ous—bipartisan meetings on immigra-
tion reform, our Republican colleagues 
seem more interested in scoring polit-
ical points rather than in pursuing 
meaningful 
solutions. 
They 
simply 
refuse to truly engage. 
This bill would create onerous, repet-
itive, and unnecessary reporting and 
investigative requirements for the in-
spector general of the Department of 
Homeland Security and require the in-
spector general to report on these 
items every 60 days for the foreseeable 
future, not to mention that many of 
the requirements in the bill are frivo-
lous, irrelevant, or duplicative. For ex-
ample, the bill would require the De-
partment of Homeland Security to re-
port on the number of migrants reset-
tled when the DHS isn’t even the Agen-
cy that handles the resettlement of mi-
grants. The DHS already has an Office 
of Immigration Statistics that does re-
port on many of the same statistics 
that this bill would now require the in-
spector general to report on. 
Finally, much of the rhetoric from 
my colleagues has centered around the

large increase on the number of en-
counters at the border. Let me empha-
size the word ‘‘encounters’’ at the bor-
der. However, these numbers ignore the 
large rates of recidivism that we are 
seeing. The ongoing use of title 42 to 
block and expel asylum seekers at the 
southern border has led to an increase 
in the number of people crossing the 
border more than once. Under title 42, 
single adults are rapidly processed at 
the border and sent right back to Mex-
ico without a deportation order. What 
this arrangement has, in essence, done 
is 
incentivize 
repeated 
attempted 
crossings. According to the Migration 
Policy Institute, the recidivism rate is 
somewhere between 28 and 38 percent. 
So this encounter statistic that is 
being called for is actually misleading. 
I am more than willing to work with 
my colleague here to try to develop ac-
tual solutions to address migration at 
our border, but when I say ‘‘solutions,’’ 
I mean real solutions—solutions that 
recognize the fundamental humanity of 
the desperate children and families 
who simply want to live to see their 
next birthdays and solutions that stay 
true to the values of our Nation. 
So, yes, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the crisis at the U.S. southern border is 
raging out of control. 
Last week, I traveled down to the 
southern border to hear from local 
leaders, law enforcement, and our 
brave Border Patrol agents in Yuma, 
AZ. I saw the border at night and dur-
ing the daylight hours with Arizona 
Department of Homeland Security Di-
rector Tim Roemer, Yuma County 
Sheriff Leon Wilmot, Yuma Mayor 
Doug Nicholls, and County Supervisor 
Jonathan Lines. I got to talk with Bor-
der Patrol in Arizona and heard from 
them about how hard this job has be-
come thanks to Joe Biden’s radical 
open border policies. 
Let me just say that these men and 
women who work at the Border Patrol 
are our absolute heroes. In Yuma, Bor-
der Patrol agents are encountering ille-
gal immigrants every day, some of 
whom are dangerous criminals, traf-
fickers, drug cartel members, or even 
terrorists. Others are families who 
have been victimized by the cartels. I 
encountered a family from Haiti while 
I was there. I watched them cross the 
border through a massive hole in the 
border wall caused by Joe Biden’s deci-
sion not to complete the already paid- 
for wall—not to complete an already 
paid-for wall. 
These families are victims of the car-
tels. Once in America, many of them 
live a life of indentured servitude and 
debilitating debt in which they have to 
send nearly all of their money back to 
the savage cartels. Many of the chil-
dren are trafficked, made to pose as the 
children of people they don’t know. We 
know that so many women and chil-
dren who make this journey are bru-
tally victimized and raped, but, still, 
the cartels push these families across 
the border. It is all just money to 
them, and Joe Biden’s actions are mak-
ing the cartels richer. 
I saw it firsthand last week. Dozens 
of migrants crossed into our country 
right in front of me while I was in 
Yuma, and we could see the savage 
coyotes watching them from across the 
river. That is what our brave Border 
Patrol is up against each and every 
day. There are about 200 Border Patrol 
agents across the entire Yuma Sector, 
but that same area is seeing more than 
700 illegal crossings every day. 
It is sad how many of our Democrat 
colleagues 
don’t 
give 
these 
brave 
agents the respect they deserve, and 
they certainly are not getting it from 
the White House. So I want to be clear 
here on the floor of the U.S. Senate: In 
America, we respect our Border Patrol, 
we respect law enforcement, and we are 
incredibly thankful for their hard work 
and for their bravery. This was not my 
first time visiting the border since 
being elected to the Senate, but it was 
definitely the worst I have ever seen it. 
Secretary Mayorkas testified in the 
Homeland Security Committee that 
the border is closed. He said the border 
is closed. He is, maybe, the only person 
in America who is going to say that. 
No one in this country believes the bor-
der is closed, and it is clearly not. I 
saw it with my own eyes, and many of 
the Members of this Chamber have seen 
it also. Secretary Mayorkas has repeat-
edly lied to me and to other Members, 
and he must resign now. 
Just this fiscal year, there have been 
1.7 million illegal border crossings. 
That is the highest ever on record. 
That means that, by the end of this 
year, about 1 out of every 150 people in 
this country will have come here ille-
gally—this year. 
In Florida, we are an immigration 
State, and we are very proud of it. We 
love immigration. It has helped build 
our State, but it has to be legal. 
Illegal immigration threatens our 
safety, undermines our legal process, 
and hurts those who are waiting to 
come here through legal channels. But 
under Biden’s system of open borders 
and illegal immigration, we are seeing 
dangerous individuals trying to come 
into this country. 
Of the 1.7 million people appre-
hended, which does not even include 
the getaways, we know that more than 
10,000 have criminal records. Now, if 
you are not going to be apprehended 
and you try to get away, are you prob-
ably more inclined to have some past 
record that you don’t want the Border 
Patrol or law enforcement to know 
about? There are 10,000 of the ones ap-
prehended who have prior criminal 
records. Nearly 1,200 have prior convic-
tions of assault or domestic violence. 
There are 2,100 who have prior drug 
convictions. Nearly 500 have prior sex-
ual abuse offenses. And the Biden ad-
ministration can’t even tell us where 
they are. They can’t tell us where any 
of these individuals are, anything 
about what has happened to them, if 
they are being held or if they have been 
deported—nothing. 
I want to be clear: These are dan-
gerous criminals who can harm our 
families—American families—and even 
one is too many. 
Along with those border crossings, 
our Border Patrol agents have seized 
more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl in 
the last year—11,000 pounds. That is 
four times as much as was confiscated 
in 2019. Now, let’s think about this: 2 
milligrams of fentanyl is a lethal 
dose—2 milligrams—and 1 pound is 
enough to kill nearly a quarter of a 
million people. If you do the math, just 
the amount the Border Patrol has con-
fiscated this year is enough to kill 2.5 
billion people. There are 100,000 Ameri-
cans who have died of drug overdoses 
this year; 100,000 Americans are dead 
because of drug overdoses just this 
year. That is 1 out of every 3,000 Amer-
icans. It is hitting Florida and every 
community across this country. Florid-
ians, like everyone in this country, 
want to live in safe communities where 
their families can thrive and prosper. 
Where is Joe Biden? He is missing. He 
is hiding from the crisis he created. I 
heard him say recently that he hasn’t 
had time to get to the border. He didn’t 
have time to get to the border. Well, I 
hope he enjoyed his vacation in Nan-
tucket last week and had plenty of ice 
cream. 
What makes you even more angry is 
that, while drugs and illegal immi-
grants 
are 
flowing 
in, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas has the audacity to come to 
the Homeland Security Committee and 
tell us that the border is closed when it 
clearly is not. It is shameful, and Sec-
retary Mayorkas should resign. 
Simply holding Mayorkas account-
able isn’t going to solve this crisis. We 
need to do more to make sure our laws 
are being upheld. This crisis and the 
administration’s refusal to do anything 
about it is why I have introduced the 
Upholding the Law at Our Border Act. 
This simple bill would require the in-
spector general of the Department of 
Homeland Security to investigate the 
vetting and processing of migrants ap-
prehended along the southwest border 
and ensure that all laws are being 
upheld. 
It is a simple question that the in-
spector general can and should answer: 
Is the Biden administration following 
all of the laws with respect to immi-
gration at the U.S.-Mexico border? 
My colleague said he wanted to 
change the immigration laws. In the 
meantime, you enforce the laws. When 
I was the Governor of Florida, I had to 
enforce all of the laws whether I liked 
them or not. That is exactly what the 
Border Patrol should be doing right 
now and what the Biden administra-
tion should be doing right now. 
It is the kind of question everyone in 
this body should be interested in: Is the 
executive branch doing its job in fol-
lowing and enforcing the laws that the 
legislative branch has passed?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8849 
December 1, 2021 
When the executive branch doesn’t 
enforce those laws, they should be held 
accountable. 
This was a simple bill to find out if 
the Department of Homeland Security 
is following all of the laws. It is pretty 
simple: Follow all of the laws in place 
as they relate to immigration and cus-
toms enforcement on our southern bor-
der. Yet my colleague objected to find-
ing out just this basic information. 
There is clearly a crisis on the bor-
der, and we all know it. Instead of en-
suring that the laws that this body has 
passed are being enforced and doing 
something about the influx of drugs 
that are killing American citizens and 
traffickers coming into our country, 
my colleague wants to hear nothing 
about it. 
There were 100,000 Americans who 
died of overdoses this last year. Every 
person who dies of an overdose impacts 
a family. It seems the Democrats in 
Washington would rather stick their 
heads in the sand and pretend that 
nothing is wrong. 
I want to ask my Democratic col-
leagues: How do you explain 100,000 
lives lost in drug overdoses to a parent 
who just lost a son or a daughter, and 
how do you explain Biden’s decision to 
open our borders to our brave Border 
Patrol agents? 
Our Border Patrol agents have no 
idea why these decisions are being 
made. I wonder if any of my Demo-
cratic colleagues has talked to a fam-
ily who has lost a son or a daughter to 
a fentanyl overdose or has talked to a 
member of Border Patrol recently. Or 
do they just have to follow the lead of 
the ‘‘open borders’’ Biden, and they can 
never object to whatever Biden wants 
and can ignore our laws and our law en-
forcement? 
We have already seen that Joe 
Biden’s policies of open borders and 
amnesty have been a total disaster for 
our Nation. He has laid out the wel-
come mat for traffickers and cartel 
members and has ignored U.S. laws 
that are designed to keep American 
families safe—to keep American fami-
lies safe—including not fully enforcing 
title 42. 
It is clear that law enforcement in 
Yuma and across our southern border 
need help, and every day that Joe 
Biden and Secretary Mayorkas fail to 
provide it, they fail the American peo-
ple. Secretary Mayorkas doesn’t work 
for Joe Biden. He works for the Amer-
ican people, and he needs to do his job 
and secure this border. 
It is a shameful decision to forsake 
the responsibility the American public 
has entrusted to Members of this body 
and to this executive branch. Enforce 
the law. It is a decision to stand 
against our Border Patrol agents and 
our law enforcement, who are putting 
their lives on the line every day to 
keep 
dangerous 
drugs 
and 
violent 
criminals from entering this country. 
That is their job, and they need help in 
doing it. 
We can’t let this stand any longer, 
because the American people deserve 
better than having 100,000 people, this 
last year, dying of drug overdoses. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

ABORTION 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, 
abortion rights are hanging in the bal-
ance at the Supreme Court, and the 
threat to Roe is very real. Why? Be-
cause, for decades, extreme Repub-
licans have attacked abortion rights 
from every angle, and they are con-
tinuing their nonstop efforts to build a 
country where patients are forced to 
remain pregnant and carry their preg-
nancies to term against their will. 
But I want to make it clear that is 
absolutely unacceptable because the 
majority of Americans don’t agree with 
extreme Republicans. The majority of 
Americans want a country where ev-
eryone can choose if and when to start 
a family, free from political inter-
ference. 
So I will not sit silently while Repub-
licans try to end the abortion rights af-
firmed by Roe v. Wade. No matter what 
happens, I will never stop fighting for 
reproductive rights, and that starts by 
passing the Women’s Health Protection 
Act to ensure the right to abortion is 
finally protected at the Federal level. 
But that is not all. I am also fighting 
for working families across the country 
who 
are 
struggling 
to 
balance 
caregiving and work, and who are 
counting on us to deliver, because we 
cannot build an economy that works 
for everyone if new parents can’t take 
the time they need to welcome a new 
child, or if workers can’t get paid leave 
when their loved ones are seriously ill. 
We can’t rebuild our communities 
when seniors and people with disabil-
ities are not able to access the services 
and support they need to live in their 
homes and in their own communities. 
And we simply cannot put our econ-
omy back on track and can’t get people 
back to work, we can’t return from 
this crisis stronger and fairer if we 
don’t, at long last, address our Nation’s 
childcare crisis. 
For 
parents 
across 
the 
country, 
childcare is unaffordable, unavailable, 
and 
absolutely 
essential. 
Childcare 
costs more today than many families 
pay for rent or mortgage or even col-
lege tuition. 
But even for those who can afford it, 
many can’t even find it. Nearly half of 
families nationwide, including 60 per-
cent of our rural families, don’t have 
enough childcare providers in their 
communities. 
And 
as 
any 
parent 
knows, you can’t go to work if you 
don’t have any options to make sure 
your kids are taken care of. 
That is exactly what we saw before 
this pandemic, when data showed 2 mil-
lion parents with kids under 5 had to 
quit a job, turn down a job, or change 
their job due to childcare challenges. 
We have seen that dynamic kicked 
into high gear during this pandemic. 
And as is too often the case, Black 
women, Latinas, women who are paid 
low incomes, and single mothers have 
been the most affected. 
While the pandemic underscored how 
essential childcare is for families, it 
also made childcare harder to get by 
forcing many providers to close their 
doors. Twenty thousand childcare pro-
viders closed during this pandemic, and 
the childcare workers hurt by those 
closures were mostly women and, in 
particular, women of color. And even 
as childcare providers try to reopen 
their doors now, childcare workers are 
struggling to make ends meet. 
The result of all of this is clear in 
headlines across the country. Watch 
KING 5 in my home State of Wash-
ington: 
‘‘Closures 
in 
Washington’s 
child care industry could hinder eco-
nomic recovery.’’ 
Read the Yakima Herald: ‘‘13% of 
child care providers in Washington 
state have closed because of pan-
demic.’’ 
Take 
a 
look 
at 
My 
Northwest: 
‘‘Washington’s child care crisis poised 
to get even bleaker post-pandemic.’’ 
Across the country, it is the same 
story in paper after paper. 
NEXTpittsburgh: ‘‘Staffing crisis at 
Pennsylvania child care centers is dis-
rupting families and slowing economic 
recovery.’’ 
The Jamestown Sun: ‘‘Child care 
shortage at root of workforce issues in 
North Dakota.’’ 
Business Insider: ‘‘ ‘Childcare deserts’ 
are a secret driver of the labor short-
age—and half of Americans live in 
one.’’ 
I could go on and on, but the 
takeaway should be pretty clear: Ad-
dressing the childcare crisis is a neces-
sity, not just for families but for every-
one. 
We have employers who can’t find 
workers. We have parents who can’t go 
back to work without quality, afford-
able childcare. We have childcare pro-
viders who are struggling to stay open 
and childcare workers who are strug-
gling to make ends meet. 
Fixing this is make-or-break for our 
economy. That is why Build Back Bet-
ter includes historic investments to 
lower families’ childcare costs, to help 
States invest in opening new childcare 
providers, raising wages for the early 
childhood workforce, and adding more 
childcare openings. 
Under Build Back Better, working 
families in this country will see their

childcare costs capped at 7 percent of 
their income, starting with those who 
need it the most. So what does that 
mean? It means that, in the very first 
year, two-thirds of our working fami-
lies in this country—about 13 million 
children—could 
be 
eligible 
to 
get 
childcare at a lower cost. It means, by 
the fourth year, 9 in 10 working fami-
lies could be eligible to send their child 
to a provider they choose and see their 
childcare costs cut by thousands of dol-
lars each year. 
For a single mother with three chil-
dren in my home State of Washington 
making $53,000, it would mean paying 
nothing for childcare. For our country, 
it would mean we have a stronger, fair-
er economy that works for working 
people, with higher wages and better 
jobs and less stress for working par-
ents—especially moms, who have been 
doing so much throughout this pan-
demic and before. 
Importantly, all this will be fully 
paid for by making sure the wealthiest 
and those at the very top finally pay 
their fair share. 
Every Republican who has said that 
they are worried about the workforce 
crisis, worried about the challenge of 
rebuilding our economy, and worried 
about how families are struggling to 
get by should be clamoring to get this 
done. It is telling about their priorities 
that, instead, they are now smearing it 
with 
false, 
bad-faith 
attacks: 
pre-
tending it is somehow not paid for—not 
true; pretending it won’t cover certain 
childcare providers—not true. 
I have heard from so many parents in 
my 
State 
about 
how 
important 
childcare is. I have heard from small 
businesses about how important this is. 
And I know my colleagues across the 
country have heard it too. So we are 
going to show families we are listening. 
We are going to show families that we 
care. Democrats are going to pass 
Build Back Better and get this done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor and join my col-
league from Washington to support a 
woman’s right to choose and to make 
sure that we are making our voices 
heard loud and clear about the discus-
sion that is happening before the Su-
preme Court and why it is so important 
to have the full reproductive health 
care choices for women in the United 
States of America. 
In 1973, the Supreme Court decided 
the Constitution protects a woman’s 
right to privacy and, thus, the choice 
to have a safe and legal abortion with-
out excessive government restrictions. 
And so now that these cases are before 
the Court, it is important for our col-
leagues to know that the majority of 
Americans support Roe v. Wade. 
In my State in 1970, the people voted 
to legalize early abortions and in 1991, 
by a vote of the people in an initiative 
process, we supported that ‘‘Every indi-
vidual possesses a fundamental right to 
privacy with respect to personal repro-
ductive decisions,’’ codifying Roe v. 
Wade into State law. That was in 1991. 
So it is concerning to people of the 
State of Washington to hear now that 
these other States, once coming here 
to talk about just certain restrictions, 
are now coming to talk about over-
turning Roe v. Wade. Women should be 
allowed to have these fundamental 
rights dependent not where they live, 
but to make sure that they have ac-
cess. And my colleague from Wash-
ington just expressed why it is so im-
portant for women and families to have 
access to those full reproductive rights. 
Women across the country for 50 
years have come to rely on these con-
stitutional protections to make deci-
sions for themselves, about their repro-
duction, their families, and their bod-
ies. That is why it is important to real-
ize that Roe is based on our privacy 
protections in the Constitution. The 
Justices wisely understood that, that a 
woman’s right to choose was about pri-
vacy, a personal issue, a medical 
choice, one in which the State had very 
limited roles subject to the highest 
standards and scrutiny of the Court. 
But some of my colleagues believe 
that it is their choice to make. They 
believe they should decide for all 
women; they believe that they should 
not make the decision for just them-
selves, but for other people and for 
other people’s family when to have a 
child. I know that in Mississippi legis-
lators have decided that rather than vi-
ability after 15 weeks, the State should 
take the choice away from women. 
In Texas, the legislature decided that 
the choice should be taken away at 6 
weeks, typically long before a woman 
might know she is pregnant. Why are 
these people who claim that they 
should be making decisions for women 
across the country now supporting ef-
forts to take away these important 
rights. The Court in Casey said, ‘‘The 
proper focus of constitutional inquiry 
is the group for whom the law is a re-
striction, not the group for whom the 
law is irrelevant.’’ 
But let’s look at what happened in 
Mississippi. In 2018, Mississippi enacted 
a State law which banned abortion 
after 15 weeks. Notably, there is no ex-
ception for rape or incest, and no ex-
ception for the health of the mother. 
They say that is their government’s 
choice. Well, I asked them, where is the 
right of the mother and the individual? 
Where is the right for that family to 
ask about the life of the mother. 
To quote an amicus brief to the 
Court on behalf of over 500 public 
health professionals, ‘‘Any ban on pre- 
viability abortion such as Mississippi, 
carries major public health implica-
tions, because it forces a woman to 
carry pregnancies to term under ad-
verse circumstances marked by sub-
stantially greater increases to their 
health and that of their families.’’ Any 
ban, continuing to read from the quote, 
‘‘any ban will disproportionately affect 
young women, women of color, low-in-
come women, and communities who are 
already vulnerable to elevated health 
and social risks and reduce access to 
necessary health care.’’ 
This is what we are talking about. A 
woman’s right to choose. Her family’s 
right to choose. And people want to see 
these rights eroded. I think that these 
are public health concerns that we all 
should be concerned about. I think we 
should be concerned that a legislature 
wanted to change these laws. In 2018, 
some in the State legislature may have 
just had had the objective of narrowly 
undermining Roe. But now, they re-
cently are changing their position and 
are asking that Roe v Wade be over-
turned. 
So all of these are important deci-
sions. As the Casey Court held, over-
ruling precedent would come ‘‘at a cost 
of profound and unnecessary damage.’’ 
I couldn’t agree more. Because of Roe 
and Casey, abortions are safe and are 
available. Women are in control of 
their bodies. Families can plan. These 
are important issues for every woman 
in America. These are their choices. 
This decision, a very difficult decision 
can be theirs and theirs alone. And 
that is why it is a matter of choice. 
So I hope our colleagues will be pay-
ing close attention to what is hap-
pening at the Supreme Court. I guar-
antee you, the people of the State of 
Washington are who as I said, codified 
Roe v. Wade into statute by a vote of 
the people. The majority of Americans 
support Roe v. Wade. And this is now a 
law that people are trying to overturn 
and overturn our privacy constitu-
tional rights. 
I yield the floor.

BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
today to talk about legislation that we 
are going to be considering in this 
month of December, critically impor-
tant legislation for the country. The 
name 
of 
this 
legislative 
proposal, 
which as many people know has passed 
the House of Representatives, is the 
Build Back Better Act, which will 
lower costs for families in ways that I, 
certainly, have never seen in the time 
I have been in the Senate. It will also 
cut taxes for families with children, es-
pecially, but for other families as well. 
I wanted to start today by talking 
about a Pennsylvanian because I think

sometimes the only way that we can 
make sense of some of the policy that 
we are talking about is to talk about it 
in terms of its impact on individual 
Americans and in this case, my case, 
individual Pennsylvanians. 
This is about a mom and her son 
from a town in Southeastern Pennsyl-
vania, not far from the great city of 
Philadelphia, Downingtown, PA. Vic-
toria Farrell. There is Victoria and her 
son Cole. Her son Cole was born with a 
mitochondrial 
disease. 
Cole 
faces 
health challenges every single day of 
his life. 
Now, because of her son’s condition, 
Victoria receives help from nurses day 
and night. Here is what Victoria said 
about the impact of those nurses on 
her son Cole and their lives together. 
She said those nurses are the ‘‘key-
stone of our lives.’’ Victoria also said 
that the nurses have ‘‘become family.’’ 
That is what these nurses mean to 
these families every day. 
Now, in the case of Victoria and Cole 
and their family, home- and commu-
nity-based services allow Cole to re-
main an active part of his community 
and to stay at home—to stay at home 
where he belongs, certainly where Vic-
toria, as any mom, would want him to 
stay. She is able to have Cole at home 
instead of being at a place far from 
their home. These services keep their 
family together and strengthen their 
bonds, the bonds between a mother and 
her son and the bonds between and 
among other family members. 
At its core, Build Back Better is 
about helping families. But in a par-
ticular way, Build Back Better is about 
caregiving and whether or not we are 
going to meet our obligations to invest 
in caregiving in ways that we have 
talked about a long time here in Wash-
ington but have never done. For far too 
long, our Nation has viewed caregiving 
as a personal problem for each family 
to solve on their own. 
Caregiving is an economic issue. It is 
not just an issue for one family to 
solve. It is an economic issue that af-
fects 
all 
of 
us. 
And 
if 
quality 
caregiving isn’t provided to one family, 
we are all diminished by that failure. 
And that is why Build Back Better pro-
vides such an opportunity, such a 
bright opportunity to provide better 
caregiving. 
Caregiving is an economic issue, and 
it is also a workforce issue. This is one 
of the problems that stands in the way, 
a real impediment to getting people 
back to work, especially in the grip 
of—and we hope soon in the aftermath 
of—the pandemic. Caregiving is about 
getting people back to work, and 
caregiving is about preparing the work-
force of the future. 
We know that the pandemic, as hor-
rible as it has been—all of the death, 
all of the suffering, all of the suffering 
endured by families, either suffering by 
way of death or disease or suffering by 
way of job loss or loss of a small busi-
ness—with all of that horror, a spot-
light was put on some problems that, 
frankly, a lot of people knew about be-
fore, and we all may have pointed to or 
talked about, but the spotlight finally 
was imposed upon so many challenges. 
The 
spotlight 
on 
the 
Nation’s 
caregiving crisis was one of the most 
pronounced spotlights that we saw in 
the whole pandemic. 
American workers, but women in 
particular, are leaving the workforce. 
This is not out of choice. It is because 
they cannot find quality, affordable 
childcare or they can’t find quality 
care for an aging parent or even the op-
tion of getting quality care for a par-
ent, a loved one, in a home- or a com-
munity-based setting. Many parents 
can’t find the care they need for a child 
with a disability. Many families don’t 
have the same opportunities that Vic-
toria and other moms have benefited 
from. 
I am the first one to say that it was 
a great breakthrough when we got the 
infrastructure 
legislation 
passed. 
I 
could rattle off all the examples of how 
it would help Pennsylvania. I will just 
give you one. That bill we know is sep-
arate from Build Back Better, but we 
are going to be able to repair and re-
place a lot of bridges in our State. That 
is a good thing. We are going to have a 
lot of money to do that. But for some 
families, 
for 
some 
Pennsylvanians, 
that bridge to work won’t simply be a 
physical bridge that connects that per-
son to their work—where they have to 
physically get to work—for other peo-
ple, their bridge to work will be qual-
ity, affordable childcare. Too often be-
cause of where we are in America 
today, it is not their bridge to work; it 
is her bridge to work. Her bridge to 
work will literally be quality, afford-
able childcare. The physical bridge 
won’t be enough. She is going to need— 
her family is going to need, for her to 
get back to work, quality, affordable 
childcare. Too many families don’t 
have that today. 
Her bridge to work also might be 
making sure or having the peace of 
mind to know that there is someone 
home with her mom providing quality 
care in her mom’s home or in another 
setting. Her bridge to work might be 
care for a son or a daughter who has a 
disability or might have multiple dis-
abilities. That is the peace of mind 
that every mother should have—every 
parent who is trying to get to work 
every day—the peace of mind that we 
can provide by making the right in-
vestments. So their bridge to work and 
her bridge to work is caregiving and so 
much else. 
We also know that we can, in the 
midst of debating legislation about 
getting people back to work and low-
ering costs for families and, frankly, 
cutting taxes for families raising chil-
dren—we can also lift up the work-
force. The workforce is paid just $12 an 
hour doing work for all these people we 
claim to care about. 
Every politician that any one of us 
know, every leading policy advocate 
will talk about how much we have to 
care for children, how much we have to 
invest in better caregiving for seniors 
and people with disabilities. But then 
there is no action or hasn’t been action 
until this legislation to lift up the pay 
of the people who are providing that 
care. If we really care about those peo-
ple, we will lift the pay of those taking 
care of them. You have to ask yourself 
in America: Who is taking care of the 
caregiver? We are not taking care of 
caregivers if they are making 12 bucks 
an hour to do the most difficult, he-
roic, and always essential work. We 
can do that as part of this legislation. 
Let me go to some numbers because 
I think these are relevant. The num-
bers that I am talking about are wait-
ing lists. You have people on waiting 
lists who are technically eligible for 
home- and community-based services, 
but they are waiting. They are not 
waiting days or weeks or months; 
many of them are waiting years on a 
waiting list. The latest number we 
saw—and I think this is a big under-
statement or undercount, but I will 
just go with the latest number we 
have—820,000 Americans on a waiting 
list. Here is the map of the United 
States. There are 820,000 older Ameri-
cans and people with disabilities on 
waiting lists. They are on waiting lists 
for that section of Medicaid, Medicaid 
section 1915(c), home- and community- 
based services waivers. They are wait-
ing for a waiver from their State to 
have the benefit that Medicaid would 
provide. 
Now, if they were going to a nursing 
home, they wouldn’t have to wait for 
any waiver. They would be granted 
that opportunity to have care in a 
nursing home. A lot of families choose 
that, and there is great care in those 
settings. But we should have a similar 
policy in place—and we don’t, but we 
will, I hope, by the end of December— 
that doesn’t have that waiver, I will 
just say, impediment or that step that 
these families are waiting for. 
Here are some of the numbers across 
the country. You can see Pennsylvania. 
There are about 1,600 on the waiting 
list. That is a big number. Here are 
some bigger numbers. I have three for 
you, just three States that tell a big 
part of the story: Florida, Louisiana, 
and Texas. Florida’s waiting list is 
70,000 people. Seventy thousand seniors 
and people with disabilities are waiting 
for services; Louisiana, 65,000 people 
are waiting; Texas, 385,000 people. They 
make up, obviously, the largest share 
of that 820,000-person waiting list. 
So you have three States—just three 
States, 
those 
three—that 
comprise 
two-thirds of the waiting list in the 
United States of America. Those three 
States have something else in common. 
They are not just three States with big 
waiting lists—Texas, Louisiana, and 
Florida—but they are three States rep-
resented by Republican Senators, six to 
be exact, two in each State, as we 
know. Republican Senators represent 
these hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans who are waiting for care.

I hope, when it comes time for vot-
ing—because that is how you dem-
onstrate what you are for around here. 
It is great to give speeches, but it is 
how you vote that indicates what you 
support. I hope that when voting starts 
on Build Back Better, the Republican 
Senators from Louisiana, Texas, and 
Florida will vote in support of this leg-
islation. The more important thing is 
they are voting to support those sen-
iors and people with disabilities in 
their States on waiting lists. 
We have some work to do when it 
comes to persuading some of our col-
leagues who today, we have no one on 
the record saying they are even willing 
to consider this legislation. We will 
see. There is still some time, still a 
couple of weeks for consideration. 
I mention the home care workers 
making $12 an hour. These essential 
workers that I spoke of earlier are 
mostly women of color doing this back- 
breaking, heroic, essential work. They 
are long overdue for a raise. We have 
some work to do to make sure that we 
bring that to the attention of the 
American people. 
I wanted to make one—tell one final 
story. Then we will move to some of 
our colleagues who are joining us here 
today. This story is particularly mean-
ingful for me because I just happened 
to be with, in this case, Brandon and 
Lynn, and the person on the left side of 
this picture is the President of the 
United States. He just happened to be 
in his hometown of Scranton, PA, 
where I still live. We were talking 
about all of these issues under the 
broad heading of either infrastructure 
or the Build Back Better legislation, 
all the benefits that would come from 
passing these bills. At the time, there 
were individuals who were lined up in 
this old train station in Scranton 
greeting the President, in many cases, 
telling the President about their own 
families, their own struggles, their own 
challenges and how Build Back Better 
would help them. 
At the very end of this long line, 
Brandon—right here sitting in a wheel-
chair—came right next to the Presi-
dent, and then Lynn, his caregiver, was 
right behind him. Brandon Kingsmore 
is his name and Lynn Weidner is his 
caregiver. I met Brandon months ear-
lier—we were all doing Zoom calls, 
right—talking about issues in Zoom 
calls and other ways of getting the 
message out. 
But I knew that the President had 
not met Brandon, and I knew that he 
had not met Lynn, and I knew that he 
had not heard their story, because it is 
a story of two people. It is someone 
who is a caregiver and someone who is 
the beneficiary of that caregiving, that 
heroic work. 
So I knew that the event was about 
to end, and I knew that it would be 
wonderful for the President to greet 
Brandon and say hello, but sometimes 
at these things there is a greeting and 
an exchange of conversation and then 
people have to move on. 
So just before the end of our greet-
ings of people coming through the line, 
I leaned over to Brandon, because I 
knew his story, and I said, ‘‘Brandon, 
before we go’’—we were literally ready 
to head out the door—I said, ‘‘Please 
tell the President what you told me 
about what Lynn means to you, what 
her caregiving means to you.’’ 
And that is what it says right there. 
He was talking about the importance 
of the caregiving that Lynn provides to 
him, and I quoted him on the poster 
right here: 
I would not be able to live the life I have. 
And then he broadened it to all care-
givers later on in his discussion with 
the President. He said: ‘‘They’’—mean-
ing caregivers, ‘‘They give us a sub-
stantial life.’’ ‘‘A substantial life.’’ 
I think Brandon’s words, more than 
any long speech, reminds us of our obli-
gations. If we care about people with 
disabilities—truly 
care—if 
we 
care 
about seniors, if we care about those 
workers, like Lynn and tens of thou-
sands of them across the country, we 
will pass this legislation because we 
can help all three and even a lot of 
other Americans. We can help seniors 
have opportunities to get care in their 
home. We can help people with disabil-
ities get the care they need, either in 
their home or in a community setting, 
and we can help the workers to lift 
them up, to invest in them because we 
claim to value them by our statements 
year after year, decade after decade. 
We have an opportunity with this 
legislation to give meaning and integ-
rity to what Brandon said to the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
The President of the United States 
has met a lot of people in his time as 
the U.S. Senator from Delaware, as 
Vice President, and now as President. 
All of us know when the words spo-
ken by one person in a setting like this 
has an impact on someone. And I knew 
Brandon’s words had an impact on 
President Biden that day, and those 
words should be ringing in our ears, 
that these caregivers give someone like 
Brandon Kingsmore—in this case, it is 
Lynn who gives him this—a substantial 
life, that is a great American idea— 
that we are going to advance policy 
that is consistent with the values we 
claim to hold as Americans, that we 
really care about seniors, we really 
care about people with disabilities, and 
we really care about those who are pro-
viding that care. 
So we will have more time a little 
later to cover some other topics, but I 
wanted to—if the Senator from Maine 
is prepared to speak— 
Mr. KING. Go ahead. 
Mr. CASEY. We will come back to 
him because we have some other col-
leagues who are going to be here later. 
I wanted to tell another story about 
another Pennsylvanian, Theo Braddy. 
Now, Theo is another person I met 
because we were talking about these 
policies back home, and we had a lot of 
Zoom calls, and I hadn’t heard Theo’s 
story until—I guess the first time was 
June 2020. 
And one of the points we have tried 
to make in this whole debate about 
quality, affordable childcare, care for 
seniors and people with disabilities, a 
whole range of caregiving issues we are 
trying to address and policies we are 
trying to advance, one of the refrains 
that so many of the advocates who 
have been traveling the country and 
knocking on doors and making the ar-
gument all across the country about 
why caregiving is important, they have 
been saying over and over again that 
care can’t wait, that there should be an 
urgency to providing better caregiving. 
So ‘‘care can’t wait’’ is a pretty good 
way of expressing it. And when I think 
of Theo, I think of that phrase, ‘‘care 
can’t wait,’’ because Theo has a story 
that a lot of families can identify with. 
He is now a resident of south central 
Pennsylvania—Harrisburg, 
PA, 
our 
State capital. And he came before our 
Aging Committee back in June, and I 
heard his story then, and I have heard 
it more than once since then. 
Theo was injured in a football game 
in the late 1970s. Theo and I happen to 
be the same age—I think almost ex-
actly—and that is where his story real-
ly began, with that football injury. 
And as he was telling the story, I was 
thinking about myself. I was thinking: 
My goodness. 
He was talking about high school, 
and I thought: All these years he has 
lived with that injury. 
And this is what it means to him: He 
ultimately started talking about what 
it meant to him years later when he 
was sitting on the third floor of his 
apartment building. He said: ‘‘Just 
looking out the window for weeks at a 
time.’’ ‘‘Looking out the window.’’ 
And there are a lot of Americans who 
have a disability who are doing some-
thing very similar: looking out a win-
dow, hoping, praying maybe, waiting 
for a better day when they are not lim-
ited to that room and that one view of 
the world. 
That is, for many of them, the full 
scope and full expanse of their world 
because they are limited to that one 
place. A lot of them want to get good 
care in their home or in the commu-
nity where they can be close to the 
people they love and still be the bene-
ficiary of good care. 
So Theo talked about looking out 
that window for weeks at a time. Now, 
when he completed his physical reha-
bilitation, he was still not able to feed 
himself or push his manual wheelchair. 
So even despite some help, he still had 
a long way to go. 
You know what changed his life? 
Home- and community-based serv-
ices. 
Here is what Theo’s life has been 
since receiving those home- and com-
munity-based services: He was able to 
obtain both his undergraduate and 
graduate degree. He has been a pro-
fessor. He has been an advocate. He 
has, in essence, run businesses. He is, 
because he received those services, 
leading a full life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8853 
December 1, 2021 
He is one of our best advocates for 
this policy because he doesn’t just talk 
about it in a personal way, he can talk 
about the mechanics of the policy. He 
can talk about the challenges that are 
in the way of so many people with dis-
abilities. 
So Theo has been able to, as he said, 
because of these services, ‘‘live a full 
life.’’ 
Sounds a lot like what Brandon said 
about, because of the care that Lynn 
provides to Brandon, he is able to 
lead—and so many others are able to 
lead—a life that is a ‘‘substantial life.’’ 
So 
these 
stories 
highlight 
why 
caregiving is an investment in that 
great American idea. A simple idea, 
but significant in the context of what 
we are talking about: the idea that we 
are going to have policy that is con-
sistent with the values we claim to 
hold. 
No one would say to us we have the— 
we have a value in America of advanc-
ing the cause of freedom—freedom here 
at home and freedom around the world. 
That is what America has stood for all 
these generations. No one would say 
that you only have to express that; you 
don’t need a policy to advance it in fur-
therance of that goal of promoting 
freedom. 
Same is true here. If we say we care 
about those Americans, we care about 
Brandon, we will help Brandon and 
Lynn providing this care. 
We will care and advance policy that 
will benefit Theo. Thankfully, Theo 
has already received those kinds of 
benefits. 
We will advance polices that will 
help mothers like Victoria have the 
peace of mind to know that her son 
Cole is going to get the care that he 
needs in the setting that she prefers 
and that anyone would prefer, that 
they have that choice. 
I am going to turn to our colleagues 
in a moment. 
I talked earlier about that bridge to 
work—her bridge to work, the bridge of 
quality, 
affordable 
childcare; 
her 
bridge to work being care for her mom 
and care for a son or a daughter who 
has a disability, or other bridges to 
work that allow her to get to work. 
Well, this bill, fortunately, has so 
much in it that will lift up families in 
addition to caregiving, that in so many 
ways this bill can be a bridge to the fu-
ture for families, can be a bridge to the 
future for workers. 
Once again, I mean, we can’t simply 
talk around here about having the best 
workforce in the world. We can’t sim-
ply 
talk 
around 
here 
about 
outcompeting China or any country. 
We have to advance policy in further-
ance of that goal, that value. 
And that is one of the reasons why 
this bill is a bridge to the future. It 
keeps our promise—the promise we 
claim to make—or we do make and 
claim to uphold for families, for sen-
iors, for people with disabilities—real-
ly, just for families across the country. 
So I think, in a very real sense, this 
legislation will advance the cause of 
justice—the justice that comes with 
knowing that you can lead a full life. 
You can have a substantial life because 
you are an American, and we have ex-
pressed these common values and we 
have passed legislation and moved pol-
icy in furtherance consistent with and 
paying allegiance to those values. 
So I want to thank our Democratic 
colleagues who are working on this bill 
with us as we just begin the debate 
over the next couple of weeks. 
And I will turn first to the Senator 
from New York, who has been a great 
fighter for families all the years that 
she has been in the Senate. I know that 
because I remember when she got to 
the Senate. I was only here about 1 
year—2 years, I guess, when Senator 
GILLIBRAND came to the Senate. And I 
want to thank her for her leadership 
and her strong voice for families and 
for caregiving. 
Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND. 
Thank 
you. 
Thank you so much, Senator. 
Madam President, I rise to join my 
colleagues in calling for the Build Back 
Better bill to include provisions that 
will solve the problems that working 
people are facing every day because of 
the magnitude of the problems caused 
by the COVID pandemic. 
Paid leave is a perfect example of 
this. Today, nearly 8 in 10 workers in 
America don’t have access to paid 
leave. Those numbers are even worse 
for lower wage workers, just 12 percent 
of whom had access to paid leave before 
the pandemic. 
But we know nearly every single 
worker will need paid leave at some 
point in their lives, whether they are 
dealing with another pandemic or a 
personal emergency. 
We have to recognize that workers 
are people first, people who get sick, 
have babies, adopt children, who need 
care for their children when they get 
sick, who have parents who will age 
and die. 
They work to provide for those fami-
lies, but providing for your family 
means, first and foremost, being able 
to care for that family member when 
they need you. Without paid leave, 
most people can’t. They are forced to 
make the impossible choice of either 
providing for their family by going to 
work or leaving their job to meet that 
need. And nobody should have to make 
that choice between earning a living 
and providing for an urgent family 
need. 
We send new mothers back to work 
when they are literally still bleeding, 
while they have stitches and they are 
still healing, before they can even rec-
ognize that they have postpartum de-
pression. We force them to leave their 
infants when they are just days old. 
They can’t nurse their infant. They 
can’t bring them to work with them. 
They can’t bond with them. They can’t 
even put them in a childcare or a 
daycare center because most require an 
infant to be at least 6 weeks old. 
Right now, many women get less 
time with their babies than dogs get 
before they are separated from their 
puppies. That is how we are valuing 
women workers right now, less than we 
value dogs. 
This issue extends far beyond new 
moms. New dads should also be able to 
have time with their new children. Par-
ents with sick children should be able 
to care for them without fear of losing 
their job. And workers who need to 
move a parent to a memory care facil-
ity or take them to chemotherapy or 
take them to doctors’ appointments or 
nurse them when they are in very ur-
gent care need—those are choices that 
families are making every day, and in 
this era of COVID, it is happening far 
more often. You shouldn’t have to risk 
your job or professional future to meet 
those urgent needs. Without paid leave, 
far too many workers have to make 
that very choice and either risk losing 
their job or having to quit or not meet-
ing that family need. It is inhumane. 
Not having a paid leave program also 
leaves us vulnerable to future health 
crises. If we had paid leave in place be-
fore the pandemic, millions of people 
could have stayed home from work 
when they got sick, limiting the spread 
of COVID, or they could have stayed 
home with their children when they 
were forced to learn remotely, limiting 
the number of people who have lost or 
had to leave their jobs when a child 
had to stay home. 
I heard from one New Yorker named 
Amir whose son’s health and special 
needs 
were 
becoming 
significantly 
complex 
and 
required 
his 
or 
his 
spouse’s full time attention around the 
clock for weeks. At a time of great 
stress, they were not only worrying 
about how they could best care for 
their son but also how they could 
maintain their livelihoods. 
Luckily, they were able to turn to 
New York State’s paid leave program. 
He told me it saved their family. They 
were able to focus on being good par-
ents without harming their ability to 
earn a living and be good professionals. 
Your ability to access that kind of 
support should not be dependent on 
where you live, but right now just nine 
States and DC have enacted paid leave 
legislation, 
leaving 
far 
too 
many 
Americans vulnerable. The numbers 
prove that paid leave keeps people em-
ployed, providing stability to their 
families and the companies they work 
for. 
A study in the Journal of Population 
Economics found that women who take 
paid leave are 40 percent more likely to 
return to work after having a new child 
than those who don’t take it. And, in 
general, workers who can take paid 
leave return to their job up to 97 per-
cent of the time. That makes paid 
leave a good business investment. It 
helps ensure that the time and money 
companies invest into an employee 
doesn’t walk out the door when the em-
ployee gets sick. Furthermore, when 
paid leave was implemented in Cali-
fornia, nine out of ten employers said 
it either did not change or improved

their profitability, employee produc-
tivity, and morale, and many said it 
decreased turnover. 
Major corporations already know 
that offering paid leave helps them at-
tract and retain the best talent. By 
making this program universal, we can 
level the playing field and allow small 
businesses to compete with them and 
hire the best of the best. In fact, the 
same survey of California employers 
found that small businesses were actu-
ally more likely to report seeing no 
change or an improvement in their pro-
ductivity and profitability when paid 
leave was implemented. So it is not 
surprising to see that 70 percent of 
small business owners and operators 
support the creation of a national paid 
leave program—70 percent of small 
business owners. 
State programs have also shown us 
that the programs are not targets for 
fraud. In California, 91 percent of em-
ployers said that they were unaware of 
any instances where their employees 
abused the State leave program. And in 
a study of New Jersey employers, none 
were aware of any instances of employ-
ees abusing the State’s paid leave pro-
gram. 
Creating a national paid leave pro-
gram makes economic sense. Every 
year that we go without paid leave 
costs American workers and their fam-
ilies $22.6 billion in lost wages. That is 
$22.6 billion that could be going back 
into our economy, helping families get 
groceries, pay bills, buy homes, start 
families, and live their lives. And it is 
estimated that the mass exodus of 
women from the workforce during 
COVID could have long-term costs as 
high as $64.5 billion in lost wages and 
economic activity every single year. 
We can stem those losses now if we 
take action. 
I would also like to note, for those 
who are worried about the pricetag of 
this bill, that paid leave was included 
in the House version of the bill, which 
CBO found essentially pays for itself. 
There is a reason every industrialized 
nation in the world has this kind of 
system. It has paid leave because it 
works. Most of them offer far more 
leave than this bill would, and their 
economies are proof that it is net posi-
tive. We cannot be a global economic 
leader when we are not even in the 
game. 
Beyond all of that, this is what the 
American people, the people who send 
us here, actually want. Seventy per-
cent of all voters support paid leave, 
including 81 percent of Democrats and 
58 percent of Republicans, who have 
said that paid family medical leave 
should be included in this reconcili-
ation bill. This is an up-to-date survey. 
The bill is designed to help the Amer-
ican people, and this is what they are 
actually asking for. 
This is a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to reshape the workplace. We 
shouldn’t squander it. 
To my colleagues who say we should 
not proceed on paid leave until we can 
do so in a bipartisan manner, I say the 
American people cannot wait for us to 
have the same conversation for another 
year that lead us to the same result— 
offers of a plan that is not universal or 
mandatory. A voluntary plan is not 
what the American people want or 
need. They need a plan that covers all 
workers for all life events. 
There is good bipartisan work that 
can be done, and I will do that. But I 
believe this is a moment in time, if we 
want to have a universal plan that can 
cover 
low-wage 
and 
medium-wage 
workers in small States, in rural 
States, and in States that don’t have 
their own paid leave plan. 
This is that one chance—that one 
chance in a generation. It is now in 
this reconciliation bill. We should not 
miss this chance. We should include a 
national paid leave plan. 
REMEMBERING ABE SCHUMER 
Madam President, I rise to include 
one 
additional 
thought 
into 
the 
RECORD, and it is to recognize the life 
of 
Abe 
Schumer, 
Majority 
Leader 
CHUCK SCHUMER’s father and a lifelong 
New Yorker, who passed away on No-
vember 24, 2021, at the age of 98. 
Abe grew up in Utica, NY, and most 
recently resided in Queens. He was a 
devoted husband to Selma, a wonderful 
parent to Chuck, Fran, and Robert, and 
a loving grandparent and great-grand-
parent. 
Abe Schumer represented the values 
and service that he instilled in his son. 
He served in World War II in Burma as 
a radar operator in planes that flew 
over the Himalayan Mountains. As a 
child of the Depression, Abe knew what 
it meant to work hard and deal with fi-
nancial struggles. When he returned to 
Brooklyn, NY, he took over a small ex-
terminating business from his father in 
order to support his mother and young-
er brothers, and then his own wife and 
three children. 
As Senator SCHUMER has said, Abe 
‘‘personified the greatest generation.’’ 
We are thankful for Abe’s devotion to 
his country and his family. Learning 
about Abe’s background and life, it is 
clear where my friend and colleague 
Chuck got his devotion to family, his 
commitment to service, and his work 
ethic. 
I send my deepest condolences to his 
wife of 72 years, Selma, and to his en-
tire family. May his memory be a 
blessing. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
to my colleague from Pennsylvania. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. CASEY. I want to thank my col-
league from New York, both for her re-
marks about paid leave and the com-
pelling case that she made. Just as we 
were talking about earlier, paid leave 
is not only a care issue, it is an eco-
nomic and workforce issue. I want to 
thank her for her advocacy and the 
fight she has waged. And, of course, I 
thank her for the wonderful comments 
about the majority leader’s dad, who 
just passed away. 
I will turn to my colleague from 
Maine next. 
Senator KING has been fighting bat-
tles on behalf of the people of Maine 
for a lot of years now, but I am par-
ticularly grateful for his most recent 
advocacy for home- and community- 
based services. He was one of a small 
group of Senators and staff that came 
together week after week after week on 
Zoom calls to talk strategy and to ad-
vance the policy. And I am grateful for 
Senator KING’s leadership and advo-
cacy on home- and community-based 
services, as well as on so many other 
issues. 
Mr. KING. I thank the Senator, and I 
particularly want to thank Senator 
CASEY for his steadfast, dogged perse-
verance in pursuit of this issue. He has 
stayed with it. He has advocated for it. 
He has been persistent and persuasive, 
and I just want to thank you. You have 
really 
exemplified 
what 
this 
body 
should be all about. It should care 
about the American people and should 
take steps to alleviate their pain. When 
they are in trouble, they have a friend 
in Pennsylvania. The people of Amer-
ica have a friend in Pennsylvania, and 
I deeply appreciate it. 
Madam President, I used to teach a 
course in college called Leaders and 
Leadership. I used case studies of dif-
ferent people, and it was a very eclectic 
group. 
It 
ranged 
from 
Ernest 
Shackleton to Joshua Chamberlain, to 
Winston 
Churchill, 
to 
Margaret 
Thatcher, and to a guy named Jack 
Welch who was the President of Gen-
eral Electric and one of the great busi-
ness leaders of the late 20th and early 
21st century. 
One of Jack Welch’s favorite quotes, 
which is also one of my favorites, is 
that ‘‘the essence of leadership is to 
look reality in the eye and then do 
something about it’’—‘‘look reality in 
the eye and then do something about 
it.’’ 
I want to talk about some realities 
this afternoon. The reality is that we 
are an aging population. Ten thousand 
people a day qualify for Medicare— 
10,000 people a day. We are an aging 
population. My State of Maine is, in 
fact, the oldest State in America. How 
old are we? Our junior Senator is 77. 
The State of Maine and the country are 
aging. That is a reality. We can wish it 
away and act like it is not really hap-
pening, but that is an enormous demo-
graphic wave that is coming at us right 
now. As the baby boomers retire and 
enter their sixties and seventies, this is 
a reality that we have—10,000 people a 
day. 
Another reality is that more and 
more of these people require care. That 
is in the nature of our physical being. 
The older people get, they require care. 
So the real question is, How are we 
going to care for these people? 
Thousands 
of 
them—hundreds 
of 
thousands—end up in nursing homes, in 
long-term care, and those facilities do 
a yeoman’s work, and they take won-
derful care of people. But 60 percent of 
the people in long-term care are paid 
for by Medicaid. Sixty percent of the

December 1, 2021 
people in long-term care are paid for by 
Medicaid. That is important because I 
am going to be making the argument 
that the investments that we are mak-
ing in this bill are, in fact, investments 
that will actually diminish expendi-
tures in other areas. 
Here’s another reality. It costs about 
$26,000 a year to provide home- and 
community-based services for a person 
with disabilities or a senior who needs 
those services—$26,000 a year. Long- 
term care in a nursing home is over 
$90,000 a year, almost four times as 
much. 
So let me add one more reality and 
then I will come to the conclusion—not 
the conclusion of the whole remarks. I 
don’t want to get your hopes up, 
Madam President—but my conclusion 
on this point. 
Part of the reality is that most sen-
iors don’t want to go to nursing homes 
until they have to. I used to go around 
Maine with my commissioner of human 
services with groups of seniors and say: 
How many of you want to go to a nurs-
ing home? No hands went up. Not that 
nursing homes don’t give good care or 
provide an essential need, but most 
people would like to stay in their 
houses, in their homes, close to their 
community, close to their family as 
long as they can. 
So if you take the financial reality 
that it is almost one-fourth, 25 percent 
or maybe 30 percent, as expensive to 
keep them in their homes, the tax-
payers are paying 60 percent of the cost 
of nursing homes. People want to be 
home. All of that argues in favor of en-
abling people to stay home. 
Every day that someone stays out of 
a long-term care facility it saves the 
taxpayers about almost $200, every day 
for each day. So if you can keep people 
in their homes longer, it is a good fi-
nancial investment. 
It also provides preventive care and 
services. That is one of the realities. 
The other reality, as Senator CASEY 
mentioned, is people with disabilities, 
people who are trapped. 
As he was making his remarks, I was 
thinking about the fundamental prom-
ise of America and the Declaration of 
Independence—life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. Abraham Lincoln 
once said that every political opinion 
he had derived from the Declaration of 
Independence. In my case, every polit-
ical opinion I have is derived from 
Abraham Lincoln, but the Declaration 
of Independence talks about life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
If you are disabled—if you can’t walk 
up these stairs and you don’t have 
some help—you don’t have much of a 
life, and you certainly don’t have lib-
erty. All we think of as liberty is to be 
able to walk out your door, go to the 
store, go to church, interact with our 
children. If you can’t do those things, 
you don’t have liberty, and you cer-
tainly don’t have much happiness. So 
we are talking about the fundamental 
promise of America—life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. It simply 
means giving people the help they 
need, and they need it through no fault 
of their own. 
It is nobody’s fault when they get 
older. That is not your fault, and dis-
ability isn’t your fault. The fellow who 
Senator CASEY talked about who was 
injured while playing football in high 
school wasn’t at fault. He wasn’t at 
fault. This kind of thing can happen to 
anybody. So that is really what we are 
talking about. 
The reality is that we have a demo-
graphic tidal wave coming at us, and 
the question is, Are we going to deal 
with it actively and confront it or are 
we simply going to sit back and say, 
you know, ‘‘It is like it has always 
been’’? It is not like it has always been. 
We have never had a demographic 
boom in the seniors like we are going 
to have in the next 20 years. Our gen-
eration—my generation—is the pig and 
the python of the demographics of this 
country, and we are going to have to 
confront it. 
So how do we confront it? We con-
front it in a number of ways. We con-
front it in several ways. 
The home care provisions of this bill 
are one of the ways to confront it. 
There is also a hidden economic benefit 
here. If people need care, they are 
going to get it one way or another. 
They may well, in many cases, be get-
ting it from their children who then 
can’t go to work. We desperately need 
workers in this economy right now, but 
they are locked up because they can’t 
leave home. They can’t leave their el-
derly moms. So to have the home-based 
services liberates people in order for 
them to participate in the economy. 
What can we do about it? 
We can do something about the 
wages of these people—of the people 
working in this industry who are pro-
viding this essential care—who are 
making $12 an hour. They are among 
the lowest paid in our society. How do 
we know that the pay is inadequate? 
When a 50-percent turnover in a home- 
based care company—in a home-based 
care exercise—in the community is 
considered good. To have 100 percent 
turnover in a year is not unusual. That 
tells you there is a real problem in the 
compensation of the workforce. So this 
bill provides funds to improve the liv-
ing standard of the people who are pro-
viding these services. It provides train-
ing. It provides a career path. It pro-
vides hope for people, not only those 
who are giving the services but those 
who are needing the services. 
I believe this is an investment. This 
is the right investment in the right 
people at the right time, and I deeply 
hope that our colleagues will come to-
gether to support this investment in a 
timely way and not wait until it is too 
late. Why wait until thousands of lives 
are restricted and constrained? Let’s 
do the right thing now. We know what 
the reality is. This bill provides us a 
golden opportunity to meet it. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Maine. 
I want to turn now to the chairman 
of the Finance Committee, the Senator 
from Oregon. Senator WYDEN has been 
with us every step of the way in Build 
Back Better but, in my case, in work-
ing on home- and community-based 
services. This would not be possible 
without his leadership. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to add 5 more minutes to our 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, be-
fore my colleague leaves, let me just 
tell him what a wonderful speech he 
gave. That was the kind of talk we 
dreamed of back in the days when I was 
the director of the Oregon Gray Pan-
thers. What Senator KING has basically 
laid out—much more eloquently than I 
could 
have—is 
that 
what 
Senator 
CASEY’s legislation is doing is giving 
older Americans the opportunity to get 
more of what they want—good quality 
care at home at a price that doesn’t 
begin to approach the alternative that 
Senator KING is talking about with in-
stitutional care. So I want to commend 
him for it. It reminds me of my Gray 
Panther days. It was a great speech. 
To my friend Senator CASEY, I have 
been so proud to be a part of this effort 
because, as you and I have talked 
about, this is what we always hoped 
for. This was always the long-term 
agenda of advocates for seniors. 
I just want to tell the Presiding Offi-
cer and colleagues who are following 
this that Senator CASEY has been ev-
erywhere on behalf of this cause. 
You have shown up at virtually every 
caucus meeting to say how important 
it is. You have come to our Finance 
Committee to stress it to colleagues on 
a bipartisan basis. We go together to 
rallies. You have been, basically, ev-
erywhere on this, and that, of course, is 
one of the reasons we are here on the 
floor—because it was your effort that 
did so much to get it into our bill. 
Now, I am going to turn to the legis-
lation in just a quick moment, but I 
want to respond to one question I have 
been asked nonstop over the last cou-
ple of days, and that is, Why is it so 
important for the U.S. Senate to pass 
the Build Back Better legislation be-
fore the end of the year? 
I am just going to respond with one 
sentence: With the Omicron COVID 
variant now in our country, it is urgent 
business to strengthen America’s eco-
nomic foundation. That is what Build 
Back Better is all about. That is what 
Senator CASEY’s provisions are doing. 
Now I am going to kind of turn to 
some of the aspects of what our effort 
has been all about. Obviously, Orego-
nians and Americans from sea to shin-
ing sea have their hands full these days 
with school, work, family, with prob-
ably trying to get in a little Christmas 
shopping as well, and it is hard to fol-
low day-to-day policy debates on the 
floor of the Senate. So I am just going 
to touch on some of the big picture 
issues that Senate Democrats are fo-
cusing on here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8856 
December 1, 2021 
First, we are all about breaking down 
barriers to good jobs that support 
American families. That is what this is 
about—more support for families. That 
is how everybody in America gets the 
opportunity to get ahead. Now, this is 
the second time in a decade that Demo-
crats have had to rebuild the economy 
after 
a 
Republican 
President 
has 
crashed it like a kid on a joyride. This 
time, families and businesses are still 
dealing with a pandemic. That is a lot 
of upheaval to deal with, and it is why 
we have said breaking down the bar-
riers to good jobs that support Amer-
ican families is the one-sentence de-
scription of our effort. 
We want to create opportunity for 
good jobs and infrastructure; we want 
to create opportunity for good jobs and 
clean energy; we want to create oppor-
tunity for good jobs in manufacturing 
here at home; and we want to create 
the conditions for small businesses and 
entrepreneurs to succeed. The key to 
unlocking 
those 
opportunities 
for 
working people in America is to make 
sure that families start in a position to 
succeed. 
This afternoon, my colleagues were 
on the floor to talk about the impor-
tance of investing in childcare and 
home-based care for seniors and those 
with disabilities. For me, this brings to 
mind a conversation, a recent one, with 
a neighbor of mine at home in Oregon. 
She and I sat down in Portland for a so-
cially distant chat in her backyard. We 
talked about what it has been like for 
families like hers, not just during the 
pandemic but over the last several 
years, as costs for education and hous-
ing and childcare have just soared into 
the stratosphere. 
Megan is about as impressive as any-
body I have met. She is smart; she 
works hard; she has got a good job. But 
even people who seem to have the 
world by the tail come up against real 
challenges. 
For example, Megan told me about 
the decision she made when her mom 
came down with a cancer diagnosis in 
2015. She decided she had to set aside 
her career and move home to the Mid-
west to help out her mom with treat-
ment. Caring for a loved one who is in 
a fight for their life is just about the 
most important work you can do. But, 
as Megan said, there is no paycheck— 
no paycheck, I would say to the Pre-
siding Officer—that comes with that 
gig, and you have still got to find a 
way to pay the bills. Fortunately, 
Megan’s mom got better. The two of 
them made the decision—we happen to 
think it was a no-brainer—to move 
back to Portland. They wanted to 
make sure that their family would 
have a chance to get ahead. 
Megan has now got two kids of her 
own. One of her kids is a wonderful lit-
tle guy who has got special needs. 
Childcare is another major challenge. 
In Oregon, this is the case of so many 
places. It is a struggle to find childcare 
at all and even harder to find childcare 
that is affordable. 
Megan told me about all of the people 
she knows—just about all of them 
women who were forced to make the 
hard decision of leaving their jobs in 
the last few years to provide daycare 
for their kids or to care for an elderly 
parent. That has been happening all 
over the country because families don’t 
have enough support. They don’t have 
enough support tonight. 
Now, people always talk about moti-
vation. What is motivating people? 
I will tell you, in Oregon—what I 
hear at home—people tell me what 
they want to do is to work hard. They 
want to contribute. They want to make 
sure that their kids are growing up 
happy and healthy, and they want their 
elderly family members to be happy 
and healthy too. They would also like 
to be able to look forward to a vacation 
once in a while in the summer and a 
dignified retirement down the road. 
Who doesn’t want all of that? 
The reality is, for so many people, 
the sky-high cost of raising kids and 
taking care of older family members 
just holds them back. So that is why 
Senate Democrats want to help with 
childcare, why we want to invest in 
home-based care, why we believe in 
paid leave. That is what the new child 
tax credit is that so many on the Sen-
ate Finance Committee, on the Demo-
cratic side, have worked for. It is that 
basic level of support that helps fami-
lies get ahead. 
People ought to be able to stay in 
their careers, if that is what they want 
to do, instead of handling childcare 
themselves. They ought to have the fi-
nancial security at home to seek out a 
new job with higher pay or better bene-
fits. People shouldn’t have to choose 
between taking care of family and 
starting 
that 
small 
business—that 
small business that their entrepre-
neurial eye always was dreaming of. 
These priorities that need addressing 
on 
childcare 
and 
home-based 
care 
aren’t just morally right, but as Sen-
ator KING pointed out—pointed out just 
now—they are commonsense econom-
ics. 
Since when, Senator KING, did it be-
come, somehow, a partisan issue to say 
that you ought to work for people to 
get more of what they want—good care 
at home at a lower price? That is, obvi-
ously, not partisan. That is common-
sense economics. It is what you laid 
out, and it is what Senator CASEY has 
been leading us on over these last few 
months. 
It is disappointing to me that col-
leagues on the other side aren’t inter-
ested in working with us on these 
issues. By the way, it didn’t used to be 
that way. 
I would say to my friend from Maine 
that Senator Olympia Snowe, when she 
was on the Senate Finance Committee, 
always worked with us. My staff used 
to joke about bipartisan bills. They 
were called Snowe-Wyden or Wyden- 
Snowe or one or the other, but you 
could almost set your clock by it. It 
was a constant. Unfortunately, we are 
missing that on this legislation. What 
we are hearing from colleagues on the 
other side is of tax cuts for those at the 
top. They don’t do much for people like 
me. We can do better. 
There are signs that the economy is 
ready to take off. COVID–19 caused the 
biggest economic crash and jobs col-
lapse in a century, but the unemploy-
ment rate is now 4.6 percent. Wages are 
going up. The economy added over 
440,000 jobs per month over the fall. 
There is no questioning the work 
ethic and productivity of the American 
people. Our job in the Congress is to 
make sure they have the support so 
they can seize those opportunities to 
get ahead. That is what we are going to 
be working on in the weeks ahead. 
That is what Senate Democrats are 
doing on the Finance Committee. That 
is what we are doing in our caucus. 
I just want to thank my friend and 
colleague Senator CASEY for being the 
spark of the cause here. He and his per-
sistence are the reason we are here and 
why this legislation has passed the 
other body. 
I am telling you, I think this is a 
really big moment for all those seniors 
and all those families who are basically 
saying, are we ever going to see these 
kinds of opportunities for healthcare, 
as Senator KING talked about, better 
care at a price that gerontologists, for 
example—you don’t have to take the 
word of a bunch of Senators; people in 
the field—I taught gerontology. When I 
saw those experts you lined up, I said: 
Senator CASEY
is really getting it 
right. So I just want to thank him. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Or-
egon. 
The chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee had to work, obviously, not 
simply on the better care and better 
jobs provisions to the home- and com-
munity-based services provisions but 
so many others as well and also to 
work on the financing of the bill, so a 
big job to undertake. 
I want to thank him for his con-
tinuing leadership and thank all my 
colleagues today for making the case 
for Build Back Better and in this case, 
one of the component parts, but mostly 
our discussion was about home- and 
community-based services. But there is 
so much more to talk about. We don’t 
have time tonight to get to all of it. 
I think what you heard from our col-
leagues—from Senator KING, from Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND, from Senator WYDEN, 
and I know the Presiding Officer shares 
these concerns and has made these 
issues a priority—we heard it right 
from the mouths of Americans, wheth-
er they live in Oregon or Maine or New 
York or Pennsylvania, wherever they 
live, and, I will remind our colleagues, 
all those folks on the waiting list in 
those three States I mentioned—Flor-
ida, Texas, and Louisiana, where two- 
thirds of the waiting list is, just three 
States.

substantial life that Lynn’s caregiving

provides him; when you hear Theo 
Braddy talk about the life that he has 
because of home- and community-based 
services; when you heard Senator KING 
talk about the savings—you want to 
pay $90,000 or $26,000 in terms of what 
taxpayers will pay over time in the 
case of 1 year’s care, $90,000 versus 
$26,000. Twenty-six thousand is what 
they pay for home care. 
So when you hear from individual 
Americans what these services mean; 
when you hear about the arguments we 
are making on cost and that this is an 
investment—this is an investment in 
America in furtherance of those values 
that we claim to hold. Senator KING 
spoke so eloquently about life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. That says 
it all. That is what Brandon Kingsmore 
was talking about, that Lynn, his care-
giver, allows him to have a shot at life 
and liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
So we have a lot of work to do be-
tween here and there, between our ad-
vocacy and our work on a bill and pas-
sage, but we are going to get there be-
cause this kind of care can’t wait any 
longer. The American people have been 
waiting for this for all the years that 
Senator WYDEN
has made the case 
when he was a slightly younger man, 
making the case with the Gray Pan-
thers all across the State of Oregon. 
People have been waiting for a long 
time. It is about time we deliver. 
Let’s pass Build Back Better, not 
only because of home- and community- 
based services but for other reasons as 
well, which we will get to in the days 
ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in reserving the right to object, here is 
my problem. 
Yesterday—and I mean yesterday— 
the Secretary of Defense released out a 
memorandum. The memorandum was 
about pay for National Guard members 
and the vaccine. We have National 
Guard members in very large numbers 
and percentages all around the country 
who have not been vaccinated at this 
point. 
Now, there are two sets of rules for 
the National Guard—one for the Air 
National Guard. Their deadline for the 
vaccination is tomorrow. Now, remem-
ber, this memorandum came out yes-
terday. Their deadline for the vaccina-
tion is tomorrow, December 2. For the 
Army National Guard, their deadline is 
the 30th of June—so two sets of rules 
for the Air National Guard and for the 
Army National Guard. They are com-
pletely different—6 months apart, plus. 
For the Air National Guard, this 
word came out yesterday with this 
statement: 
No Department of Defense funding may be 
allocated for payment of duties performed 
under title 32 for members of the National 
Guard who do not comply with Department 
of Defense COVID–19 vaccination require-
ments. 
Then there is this statement: 
No credit or excused absence shall be af-
forded to members who do not participate in 
drills, training, or other duty due to failure 
to be fully vaccinated against COVID–19. 
What does this mean in real life? 
Well, in real life it means, as of to-
morrow, members of the Air National 
Guard, not the Army National Guard— 
they have 6 more months, plus. But 
members of the Air National Guard, as 
of tomorrow, even if they are not on 
Federal duty, will no longer be paid, 
will no longer be allowed to drill. That 
means, this coming weekend, Air Na-
tional Guard members who were head-
ed to drill who have not been vac-
cinated can’t drill. 
What does that mean in real life? 
Well, National Guard members don’t 
get TRICARE free and taken care of 
and provided for by the taxpayers like 
Active Duty does. To get TRICARE 
from them, it comes out of their 
checks, but if they are not getting a 
check, then it interrupts their pay-
ments. 
So what the Secretary of Defense did 
yesterday was announce that Air Na-
tional Guard members, as of this week-
end, will not be paid anymore, will not 
be allowed to drill anymore, and we 
have thousands of them all over the 
country. At the last check, the Guard 
had about 50 percent compliance on the 
vaccination. 
In some areas of the Guard, they 
have very serious concerns—well, let 
me just identify this—not just as a 
readiness issue in that we have individ-
uals who have served in the Guard for 
years who now are, suddenly, not going 
to be paid and are going to have their 
insurance at risk. It is not just that, 
but this is also a federalism issue. I 
know this gets lost in the conversa-
tion, but the National Guard is not Ac-
tive Duty. They are not reservists. The 
National Guard, when they are under 
title 32, actually work for the State. 
The National Guard in my State works 
for the Governor of my State. The Gov-
ernor of my State is their commander 
in chief. According to the U.S. Con-
stitution, for the Guard members, their 
officers are selected by the Governor of 
the State. That is how we set up the 
National Guard. It is not the Active 
Duty. It is not the Reserves. They are 
different. The time when they are fed-
erally connected is in what is called 
title 10, and the U.S. President actu-
ally calls them up, and they shift from 
title 32, under the States’ authority, to 
title 10. 
Do you want to know what the sepa-
rations are even in funding? Let me 
make it clear. 
The way the statute actually lays 
this out under title 32, section 108, is, if 
there is a Guard unit that is not com-
plying, then the DOD can cut funding 
to the State, not to individual mem-
bers. What is this memorandum? It is 
not cutting funding to the State; it is 
cutting funding to individuals who are 
within the Guard. That is not allowed 
under title 32, section 108. The con-
sequences for a Guard unit not being 
ready is to cut off funding to the State. 
That is how the section works. In fact, 
even just a few years ago, in an NDAA 
just like what we are debating, there 
was a section to allow the DOD to be 
able to reach into units and to be able 
to take on and punish individuals with 
their pay, and that was blocked here in 
this body. It was not allowed. But this 
administration is going around Con-
gress, around the States, reaching into

individual airmen and docking their

That is a terrible precedent. That is 
terrible for the families in this Na-
tional Guard unit. It is terrible for the 
morale, even because the Pentagon 
gave one set of rules to the Army 
Guard and another set of rules to the 
Air Guard, and these individuals, as of 
this weekend, will not be paid anymore 
unless this body acts. 
So my request is very straight-
forward. The amendment that I bring 
to the floor protects the National 
Guard not just in my State but all over 
the entire country because there are 
Air Guard members in every one of our 
States who are worried about what is 
going to happen tomorrow to them 
when they have been faithfully serving 
their country. 
All that I ask is we file this simple 
amendment; that we allow a vote on 
this simple amendment in this body; 
and that we prohibit the discharging of 
the withholding of pay and benefits to 
National Guard members based on 
their COVID–19 vaccination status. 
It is very straightforward. It is very 
clean. It does nothing but say: We 
stand with our National Guard mem-
bers, and we will not allow their pay to 
be cut, not only because we stand with 
them individually, but we also disagree 
with the interpretation of the Pen-
tagon, which is not allowed to reach 
into a unit, select individual members, 
and not pay them. That is not the way 
that it works under title 32, section 108. 
So, yes, I ask to modify the request 
to include my amendment No. 4863. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The senior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, in re-
serving the right to object, let me ex-
plain what is going to happen here in a 
second. 
We have all heard the stories, right? 
In China, in the Xinjiang Province, 
Uighur Muslims are taken from their 
homes and their families. They are 
forced to work in their factories as 
slaves. They are forced to renounce 
their religion, to change their names. 
There is forced sterilization, forced 
abortions. It has been characterized— 
rightfully so—as genocide. 
So I filed a bill with bipartisan sup-
port, and this bill says that any prod-
uct that is made in a factory in that 
part of China has the presumption that 
it is made by slaves. It passed the Sen-
ate unanimously, and it is sitting over 
in the House. So I am trying to get it 
here as an amendment on this bill. 
Here is what happens. 
In the House, they have this thing 
where they come forward and say: 
Under the Constitution, if it generates 
any revenue, it has to start in the 
House. The problem I have with that is 
that they interpret it very differently 
than how the Supreme Court has inter-
preted that clause in the Constitution: 
very broadly—in fact, so broadly that 
they can basically use it on virtually 
anything. They can just apply it to 
anything they don’t like. So this is 
really not about being revenue-gener-
ating. The CBO says it is insignificant, 
really. This is about the fact that they 
don’t want this bill to pass over in the 
House. 
I understand why. Listen. 
There are some big companies out 
there, some very big companies. We 
know that, for a time, Apple and Nike 
and a lot of big companies have been 
pushing against it. They are not going 
to admit it. Who is going to go out lob-
bying in favor of slave labor? But this 
is their bottom line: They make a lot 
of money by making stuff by people 
who aren’t paid to make it, and they 
are lobbying against this thing. I am 
sure they have got a rationale for it 
that they have given people. The bot-
tom line is, the House doesn’t want to 
pass it or, at least, some people over 
there don’t. The reason I know that is 
because we passed it here unanimously, 
and we sent it over there. 
Let me tell you what: If this were a 
revenue issue—this was the issue. The 
issue was, we are in favor of the policy. 
You are right. There shouldn’t be slave 
labor, and we shouldn’t be partici-
pating in it, but—but—we can’t do it in 
this bill because it impedes on our pre-
rogative as the House. 
If that were really their position, it 
would be very simple. You would pass 
our version, take the House version, 
pass the House version of our bill, and 
send it over here, and it becomes the 
law. Why haven’t they done that? Let 
it originate over there, and send it 
here. They haven’t offered to do that. 
Do you know why they haven’t done it? 
Because they are not for this—they are 
not for it—and they wield this blue-slip 
thing to mean whatever they want it to 
mean. 
I support many but not all of these 
amendments on here. Some of them 
have bigger revenue implications, but, 
apparently, those don’t have blue slips 
because they are for them. The blue 
slip cannot mean it applies when I am 
not for the policy, and it doesn’t apply 
when I am for it. That is the bottom 
line. That is the way to answer it. 
So I am going to renew what I did 
here a few days ago, and that is that I 
am going to ask to modify the request 
to include my amendment, which is the 
body of this bill that every Member of 
the Senate has already voted for, 
amendment No. 4330. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, in re-
serving my right to object, the Senator 
from Florida is right. 
The key issue here is the blue slip, 
which originates from the constitu-
tional language mandating that all 
revenue bills must begin in the House 
of Representatives. If it is determined 
by the House that it is a revenue bill, 
then anyone—I am informed in the 
House—can object, not just to the 
amendment of the gentleman from 
Florida but to the entire bill. 
Essentially, if we pursue this, we 
would put at risk the entire National 
Defense Authorization Act for reasons 
that could be related to the issue the 
Senator from Florida brings up, but it 
could be related to many other issues, 
and there are quite a few issues in this 
bill. 
So, for that reason, I would object to 
the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, so 
let me inform the Members and the 
public as to what has happened here, 
which is just a sad, tragic, and almost 
absurd point. 
Now, last week, we in the majority 
offered to have an open process, and we 
agreed 
to 
18 
amendments—more 
amendments than has been done on the 
Defense Act under 4 years of Leader 
MCCONNELL’s 
leadership. 
They 
ob-
jected—seven Members objected. 
So when we came back this week, we 
worked all week to try and come to an 
agreement. Now we were up to 25 
amendments. 
And 
the 
leader, 
Mr. 
INHOFE, and Senator REED, who has 
done a great job, came to an agreement 
to go forward, which we thought we 
might do. But one Senator, the Senator 
from Florida, stood in the way of us 
moving forward. 
The Senate rules—some may call 
them absurd by now—allow any one 
Senator to block us from moving for-
ward. And the Senator from Florida in-
sisted on his amendment. 
The irony, the sort of absurdity, and 
the sadness of this is, if his amendment 
were on the bill, it would automati-
cally kill the bill because it would be 
what is called blue slipped in the 
House, which means any bill that pro-
duces revenue must start in the House, 
and the House will kill a bill that has 
an amendment that contains it. 
So Senator RUBIO prevented these 30 
amendments from being voted on, the 
Senate from moving forward on the 
Armed Services bill, because he in-
sisted that we add his amendment, 
which was a killer amendment, which 
would kill the bill altogether.

S8859 
December 1, 2021 
Can you get more absurd than this? 
It makes no sense—no sense whatso-
ever. 
I would ask MARCO RUBIO to sleep on 
this overnight, Senator RUBIO. 
His bill, which already passed the 
Senate separately, will not accomplish 
what he wants because it will just blow 
up the entire bill—the entire Defense 
Authorization Act. 
But, instead, he came to the floor 
and objected when both Democratic 
and Republican leaders said we want to 
move forward, and so we can’t move 
forward. This will be the first time 
that an NDAA bill has not moved for-
ward, and it all falls on the shoulders 
of one Senator, MARCO RUBIO. 
Now, I would hope my Republican 
colleagues who are listening to this, 
who have things in the bill they want, 
would go to Senator RUBIO and ask him 
to back off so tomorrow morning we 
might get started. But the odds of that 
are slim. The odds of that are slim. 
I must say, Leader MCCONNELL, Sen-
ator INHOFE, the ranking member, as 
well as JACK REED, and myself have 
worked hard together to accommodate 
Senators whenever we can, and that is 
why we had a list of 25 amendments. 
That is why we were prepared to sit 
here in 15-minute intervals and churn 
through those amendments. 
But the Rubio amendment is a poison 
pill in the sense that it blows up the 
whole bill. Any one Member of the 
House can say, ‘‘I object to the bill,’’ 
and, of course, one would, and that 
would be it. 
So how does it help move forward on 
the NDAA bill? How does it even help 
Senator RUBIO’s goals with the Uighurs 
by insisting on preventing anything 
from moving forward unless his pro-
posal gets in the bill, which would de-
stroy the bill? 
That is the absurd place we are in to-
night. It is regrettable. It is sad. It 
undoes the work of so many Senators 
on both sides of the aisle, and it speaks 
to the need to restore the Senate and 
change these rules.

WORLD AIDS DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on 
December 1, we mark the 33rd anniver-
sary of World AIDS Day, which gives 
us an opportunity to pause and reflect 
on the lives lost to HIV/AIDS, how far 
we have come in the fight against this 
virus, and what we need to do to ensure 
an AIDS-free future. 
Since the first cases of AIDS were re-
ported domestically in June 1981, more 
than 700,000 Americans have tragically 
died due to AIDS-related complica-
tions. Significant scientific advances, 
brought about by public and private 
partnerships, led to the development of 
antiretroviral therapies—ARTs—which 
have been instrumental in decreasing 
AIDS-related mortality rates by more 
than 80 percent since they peaked in 
1995. Investment in U.S. disease sur-
veillance, prevention, and public edu-
cation has similarly led to an almost 
50-percent decline in the incidence of 
infection since 2010. 
We are fortunate to have premier sci-
entific research institutes within my 
home State of Maryland working to-
gether to combat this deadly virus. The 
National Institutes of Health, the Wal-
ter Reed Army Institute of Research, 
and the Institute of Human Virology at 
the University of Maryland all lead 
U.S. and global research on developing 
treatments and a vaccine for HIV/ 
AIDS. The world-class research institu-
tions housed in Maryland have not 
only substantially led the scientific ad-
vancements with respect to HIV/AIDS; 
they have also played a significant role 
in reducing the number of new cases 
among 
Marylanders 
and 
affording 
those who contract HIV/AIDS to con-
tinue living full lives. Across Mary-
land, more than 30,000 adults or adoles-
cents were living with HIV at the end 
of 2020. 
Though my State ranks seventh 
among all U.S. States and Territories 
in HIV diagnosis rates per 100,000 peo-
ple, we are making great strides to pre-
vent new infections. Last year, Mary-
land recorded fewer than 1,000 new 
cases of HIV infection for the third 
consecutive year and a significant de-
crease over the peak of 2,612 new HIV 
infections among Marylanders in 1991. 
Public health initiatives the Maryland 
Department of Health implemented 
have been instrumental in reducing 
new infections, including programs 
like 
safe-sex 
education 
programs, 
condom distribution, access to prophy-
lactic medication, and a statewide nee-
dle-exchange 
program 
for 
injection 
drug users. 
Today, 
approximately 
1.2 
million 
Americans are living with HIV, and 
they are able to lead healthier and 
safer lives due to increased access to 
care under the Patient Protection & 
Affordable Care Act, ACA. The ACA 
has led to increased patient protections 
such as the prohibitions on rate-setting 
tied to health status, the elimination 
of preexisting condition exclusions, 
and an end to lifetime and annual dol-
lar limits. Still, there are challenges 
ahead. Increasing prescription drug 
costs for ART regimens and health in-
surance benefit designs that shift out- 
of-pocket costs onto patients risk the 
progress we have made to end the HIV 
epidemic in the U.S. 
Although Federal financial support 
to Medicaid, the largest source of in-
surance coverage for people living with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

December 1, 2021 
HIV, has increased through the dura-
tion of public health emergency due to 
the COVID–19 relief bills, tightening 
State budgets amid record Medicaid 
enrollment could hinder access to 
treatment or care for the HIV/AIDS 
population. 
Forty-two 
percent 
of 
adults with HIV receive healthcare 
under Medicaid. 
In the U.S., the fight against this dis-
ease also disproportionately affects 
communities of color, with Black and 
Latino Americans accounting for a dis-
proportionate share of new HIV diag-
noses and deaths, consisting of about 70 
percent of new diagnosis despite mak-
ing up roughly 30 percent of the U.S. 
population. The Biden-Harris adminis-
tration’s theme for World AIDS Day 
this year is ‘‘Ending the HIV Epidemic: 
Equitable Access, Everyone’s Voice,’’ 
denoting a strong commitment to ad-
dressing health inequities within the 
epidemic. I share the administration’s 
determination 
to 
address 
the 
dis-
proportionate impact of the epidemic 
on marginalized populations like the 
LGBTQI+ community and racial and 
ethnic minorities. 
Internationally, the U.S. has in-
vested more than $100 billion in the 
global HIV/AIDS response through the 
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief—PEPFAR—and the Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma-
laria, Global Fund. This investment 
has saved more than 20 million lives, 
prevented millions of people from be-
coming infected, and achieved HIV/ 
AIDS epidemic control in more than 50 
countries. Since 2003, PEPFAR has 
changed the trajectory of the HIV epi-
demic around the globe by expanding 
access to HIV prevention, treatment, 
and care interventions. PEPFAR is one 
of the most successful and cost-effec-
tive efforts in the history of American 
foreign assistance. 
Despite the progress we have made 
around the globe, there is still signifi-
cant work to do. Of the 38 million peo-
ple globally living with HIV, 12.6 mil-
lion are not accessing lifesaving treat-
ment. In 2019, there were 1.7 million 
people newly infected with HIV—more 
than three times the global target— 
and 690,000 people perished from this 
terrible disease. While we have made 
strides in combating HIV/AIDS in east-
ern and southern Africa, we have seen 
increases in new infections in Eastern 
Europe, central Asia, the Middle East, 
and Latin America. 
As with last year’s commemoration, 
this year’s World AIDS Day finds us 
continuing to battle the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Support through PEPFAR and 
the Global Fund has financed efforts to 
minimize the disruption of the pan-
demic on HIV epidemic response ef-
forts, through services like telehealth 
and 
multimonth 
dispensing 
of 
antiretroviral therapies. The COVID–19 
pandemic, however, continues to affect 
the global response to HIV and threat-
ens the decades of progress we have 
made against this disease. In addition 
to disrupting HIV treatments and pre-
vention services, downstream impacts 
of the pandemic have cut off vulnerable 
populations from educational and so-
cial support services, and growing in-
equalities resulting from the economic 
downturn are likely to lead to in-
creases in HIV risk behaviors and vul-
nerability. The Global Fund reported 
that last year, HIV testing dropped by 
22 percent and the percentage of HIV- 
positive TB patients on antiretroviral 
therapies dropped 16 percent. 
A world free from HIV requires global 
leadership from the United States, and 
we have stepped up to the plate by 
heavily investing in the global re-
sponse to HIV. From significant con-
tributions to the Global Fund to the 
creation 
of 
PEPFAR, 
U.S. 
global 
health leadership and international 
collaboration helped to turn the tide 
on the global epidemic. This is as true 
today as it was 33 years ago. Inter-
national public health crises require 
international responses. Unlike the 
previous 
administration, 
I 
support 
President 
Biden’s 
actions 
to 
reprioritize cooperative global health 
response efforts. We are only as strong 
as the weakest health system, and it is 
incumbent upon the U.S. to lead global 
health response efforts as we look to 
end the COVID–19 pandemic and HIV/ 
AIDS epidemic. 
One of the biggest tragedies of the 
HIV epidemic is that millions of people 
around the world died while waiting for 
treatment, and once treatment became 
available in 1987, it was out-of-reach. 
At about $8,000 a year—more than 
$17,000 in today’s dollars—the first HIV 
drug was too expensive for populations 
who needed it most: low-income com-
munities in the U.S. and low and mid-
dle-income countries. While Congress 
authorized $30 million in emergency 
funding to States to pay for low-in-
come patients’ treatment, global ac-
cess to the drug lagged. For example, 
when we established PEPFAR in 2003, 
only 50,000 people in Africa were ac-
cessing lifesaving HIV treatment. 
We cannot make the same mistake 
with COVID–19. While we have made 
great strides domestically to vaccinate 
our population, it is equally important 
to vaccinate the rest of the world from 
COVID–19. The Biden administration 
has made significant strides to supply 
and commit future supplies of vaccines 
to low-income countries, and I implore 
the administration to continue work-
ing with vaccine manufacturers to ex-
pedite this effort as fast as humanly 
and safely possible. Equally important 
is ensuring access, when approved, to 
antiviral treatments. One potential 
antiviral treatment reduces the risk of 
hospitalization and death by 89 percent 
in high-risk adults when used in con-
junction with ritonavir, a medication 
commonly used to treat HIV. The po-
tential success of this antiviral treat-
ment is a testament to the biomedical 
infrastructure of the United States, 
where the incredibly innovative treat-
ments we developed for HIV may be ef-
fective in battling the COVID–19 pan-
demic, too. 
COVID–19 does not respect borders. 
To protect our domestic health, we 
must ensure that our allies and low 
and middle-income countries around 
the world have affordable access to 
eventually approved COVID–19 vac-
cines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. 
While we celebrate the progress we 
have made with respect to HIV/AIDS 
this World AIDS Day, we must recom-
mit ourselves to continuing this fight 
because success is within our grasp. 
We have made so much progress 
through 
international 
partnerships. 
Donor nations; civil society; people liv-
ing with HIV; faith-based organiza-
tions; scientific research community 
and academic partners such as Johns 
Hopkins University, the University of 
Maryland, and the Walter Reed Army 
Institute of Infectious Disease Re-
search; the private sector; foundations; 
and implementing organizations such 
as Catholic Relief Services and Lu-
theran 
World 
Relief 
have 
com-
plemented those partnerships tremen-
dously. We must apply the lessons of 
the fight against HIV to our current 
battle against the COVID–19 pandemic 
so we can save more lives and get the 
global economy back on track.

TRIBUTE TO ROBIN SQUATRITO 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a devoted American 
patriot on her retirement from Federal 
civil service. Mrs. Robin Squatrito has 
served as the Director of Legislative 
Affairs for North American Aerospace 
Defense Command and United States 
Northern 
Command 
in 
Colorado 
Springs, CO, for over 15 years. During 
that time, she has provided expert leg-
islative advice to nine NORAD and 
USNORTHCOM commanders, served as 
the principal liaison between the com-
mands and the congressional defense 
committee staffs, and facilitated a tre-
mendous collaborative relationship be-
tween NORAD, USNORTHCOM, and 
Congress—including my staff and me— 
as the commands have stood constant 
watch over the United States and Ca-
nadian homelands. 
In fact, Robin was a member of 
USNORTHCOM from the day the com-
mand was established in October 2002. 
At that time, she was serving our Na-
tion as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force 
and was hand-selected by the first com-
mander of USNORTHCOM, Gen. Ralph 
Eberhart, to be the Director of his 
Commander’s 
Action 
Group. 
USNORTHCOM was established in the 
aftermath of the attacks of September 
11, 2001, and Colonel Squatrito played 
an instrumental role in ensuring the 
command was organized and ready to 
safeguard our homeland from further 
attacks. When she retired after 26 
years in uniform, it was only a matter 
of time before she answered the call to 
serve once more. 
From the day Robin returned to 
NORAD and USNORTHCOM as a civil 
servant, she has been a tireless advo-
cate for our national defense. She is

well known inside and outside the

for NORAD and USNORTHCOM, as well 
as for the men and women responsible

Robin has repeatedly demonstrated her 
passion for doing the right thing and 
her commitment to high standards as 
she 
has 
guided 
nine 
NORAD 
and 
USNORTHCOM commanders through 
countless posture hearings, briefings, 
CODEL visits, office calls, phone calls, 
and numerous other engagements with 
Members of Congress and our staffs. 
Robin’s colleagues and her family 
will tell you that she has always been 
one of the first leaders at work in the 
morning, and can often be found at her 
desk well after standard duty hours. 
And for Robin, time away from the of-
fice has never meant she was off duty. 
She is never far from her phone or her 
email in order to ensure commanders 
and Members of Congress always re-
ceive a prompt and professional re-
sponse to any question, request, or con-
cern. That is one of the reasons why 
Gen. Glen VanHerck, the current com-
mander of NORAD and USNORTHCOM, 
has said Robin is ‘‘one of the most dili-
gent and dedicated professionals I’ve 
had the privilege of serving with over 
my more than 34 years in uniform. 
Robin’s devotion to our country, home-
land defense, and our commands is 
boundless. 
She 
embodies 
the 
true 
meaning of selfless service for a noble 
cause.’’ 
And it is certainly fitting to offer our 
Nation’s sincere thanks to Robin’s 
family for their decades of service and 
sacrifice. That includes her husband, 
retired Col. Joe Squatrito, who also 
served our Nation with honor as an Air 
Force officer. It also includes their 
children, Michael and Stacey. As the 
entire Squatrito family looks forward 
to the coming new year with limitless 
opportunities and adventures ahead of 
them, Robin and Joe are also preparing 
to take on important new titles and re-
sponsibilities 
as 
first-time 
grand-
parents. 
It is my honor to thank Robin 
Squatrito for her lifetime of devoted 
service to our Nation. I wish her and 
her family all the very best in her ex-
traordinarily well-deserved retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. ROBERT 
FINBERG 
∑ Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, 
today I remember and honor Dr. Rob-
ert William Finberg, a highly esteemed 
virologist, researcher, clinician, pro-
fessor, and resident of the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts. 
Dr. Finberg was an example for 
countless across the Commonwealth. 
He was internationally known for his 
indispensable work on infectious dis-
eases, where he focused much effort on 
influenza and coronaviruses. 
Dr. 
Finberg 
received 
his 
under-
graduate degree from the University of 
Chicago, after which he pursued his ca-
reer in infectious disease. He obtained 
his medical degree from the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine with AOA 
honors, then went on to complete his 
internal medicine residency at the New 
York University School of Medicine. 
He also completed an Infectious Dis-
ease Fellowship at Brigham and Wom-
en’s Hospital. Dr. Finberg finished his 
postdoctoral training in the laboratory 
of Dr. Baruj Benacerraf at Harvard 
University 
where 
he 
made 
groundbreaking contributions to im-
munology. Over the course of his ca-
reer, he was awarded numerous grants 
to continue his transformative re-
search. 
Dr. Finberg used his experience and 
expertise to the benefit of the Com-
monwealth, where he played an instru-
mental role in protecting our commu-
nities from COVID–19. He served in 
Governor Charlie Baker’s COVID–19 
Vaccine Advisory Group and spear-
headed research on both COVID–19 
treatments and vaccines. He labored 
heroically to ensure that the public re-
mained informed about the pandemic. 
His work was unparalleled, and his ac-
complishments will stand the test of 
time. 
Dr. Finberg also shared his knowl-
edge with those who carry on his leg-
acy. He was an integral member of the 
UMass Medical School community, 
where he spent more than 20 years as 
the chair of the department of medi-
cine. His passion for medicine and edu-
cating future healthcare providers is 
best exemplified by the achievements 
of his students and the patients who 
have benefited from their care. Dr. 
Finberg was a dedicated medical pro-
fessional, mentor, and advocate. 
Dr. Finberg cherished time with his 
family and friends and will be remem-
bered for his warmth, compassion, and 
curiosity. He deeply impacted the lives 
of those around him. His service to his 
community, the Commonwealth, and 
the country will never be forgotten.∑

TRIBUTE TO ARRIS JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. 
MORAN. 
Madam 
President, 
today I would like to recognize the 
birthday of Dr. Arris Johnson. Mr. 
Johnson is a lifetime Kansan and a per-
sonal friend who has reached the re-
markable milestone of turning 100 
years old this past weekend. 
Dr. Johnson was born on November 
28, 1921, and attended grade school in 
Decatur County. He never strayed far 
from his roots attending college at 
Fort Hays State University and grad-
uate school at Kansas State Univer-
sity. He still resides in Hays with his 
wife, Virginia. 
Just 6 weeks before his graduation 
from Fort Hays State, he was called to 
serve our Nation. In 1945, Dr. Johnson 
enlisted and served in the Elbe River 
region for the U.S. Army during World 
War II. It was his work in the Red 
Cross division that began his interest 
in teaching and counseling work. 
Following his service, Dr. Johnson 
returned to Kansas and continued his 
education, receiving his master’s from 
Kansas State University before return-
ing to Fort Hays State to teach coun-
seling for nearly three decades. 
After retiring in 1985, he was named 
the freemason grandmaster for the 
State of Kansas. Additionally, Dr. 
Johnson was further honored with the 
Distinguished Service Award, which 
recognizes individuals who have dem-
onstrated a continuing concern for hu-
manity; support spiritual, cultural, and 
educational objectives; and exemplify 
the highest standards of character. 
These characteristics could not de-
scribe Dr. Johnson more appropriately. 
Dr. Johnson is a loving husband to 
his wife Virginia Johnson, and they 
will celebrate their 75th anniversary in 
January with their family and friends. 
They continue to reside in Hays, KS, 
where I hope they enjoy many more 
years together. 
It is clear to everyone that knows Dr. 
Johnson that he has made the most of 
his 100 years. His contributions to Kan-
sas and our Nation are worthy of com-
mendation. A beloved husband, father, 
grandfather, and soldier, Arris is a 
tribute to the ‘‘Greatest Generation,’’ 
and a grateful Nation and State thank 
him for his service. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in 
wishing a happy birthday to Arris and 
a profound thank you for his work in 
our community. His exemplary service 
to America and his local community is 
emblematic of what makes America a 
great Nation.∑

REMEMBERING BRUCE CORWIN 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise to celebrate the life and mourn the 
passing of Bruce Corwin, a pillar of the 
sports and entertainment industries, a 
dedicated philanthropist, and a dear 
friend. 
Born and raised in California, Bruce 
believed deeply in the power of people. 
As a college student at Wesleyan, he 
traveled to Baltimore to march along-
side Martin Luther King, Jr., and he 
protested fraternity discrimination by 
starting a new, inclusive group. After 
graduating in 1962, he participated in 
the Coro Fellows Program for aspiring 
public servants, the start of a lifelong 
relationship with Coro through which 
Bruce supported generations of civic 
leaders. 
Bruce made his career at Metropoli-
tan Theaters, his family’s business, 
which brought English- and Spanish- 
language movies to theaters across the 
Southwest. He was the third genera-
tion of his family to oversee the com-
pany, and he led it with passion for 40 
years. Bruce extended his leadership 
into the community, where he was

known for organizing mentorship and 
tutoring programs at his alma mater, 
Los Angeles High School. He supported 
countless charitable causes and was a 
beloved leader in California’s Jewish 
community. 
I first met Bruce in 1994, when I was 
a Coro Fellow. Over the years, we bond-
ed over talks of family, community, 
and leadership, as well as baseball, 
movies, and just a little politics. He al-
ways supported my public service aspi-
rations. And he was an invaluable part-
ner in fulfilling one of my passion 
projects, to open a state-of-the-art 
children’s museum in the San Fer-
nando Valley. After a 14-year journey, 
the Discovery Cube Los Angeles opened 
its doors in 2014. 
Bruce was incredibly kind, wise, gen-
erous, and compassionate. Everyone 
who knew Bruce felt blessed by his in-
fectious and infinite optimism and in-
spiration. On a personal note, I remain 
in incredible admiration of the love 
that he and his wife Toni shared. It re-
minds me so much of the love and com-
mitment my own parents shared. 
My wife Angela and I send our deep-
est condolences, love, and prayers to 
Toni Corwin and the entire Corwin 
family. We were blessed to share in so 
many great memories with the count-
less people around the country that 
Bruce touched and inspired throughout 
his life.∑

RECOGNIZING TRAILS WEST 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today, I am 
pleased to honor Trails West in Preston 
as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for December 2021. 
Trails West, renowned for its world- 
class craftsmanship and innovative de-
signs, is the No. 1 manufacturer of 
horse, living quarter, and stock trailers 
in the United States. Founder Steve 
Reeder worked in RV manufacturing 
before returning to his hometown of 
Weston to raise his family. After sev-
eral years of working on his family’s 
farm, Steve saw an opportunity to revi-
talize a struggling local manufacturer. 
Armed with expertise in RV manufac-
turing and business acumen, Steve 
hired the former business’ laid-off em-
ployees and established Trails West in 
1987. 
Trails West manufactures with cus-
tomer experience in mind. The com-
pany was one of the first to recognize 
women as the largest demographic of 
horse trailer owners, prompting them 
to incorporate consumer-friendly inno-
vations into their designs. In addition, 
Trails West stands out in the industry 
by utilizing steel frames to deliver a 
long-lasting and reliable product to 
their customers. Thanks to their suc-
cess and devotion to crafting the best 
trailers possible, Trails West has grown 
to employ more than 160 Idahoans and 
is recognized as the premier manufac-
turer of horse trailers in the country. 
While the company has gained na-
tional fame and recognition, Trails 
West has stayed true to its Idaho roots. 
Both the Reeder family and Trails 
West have donated generously to local 
schools, supported the construction of 
athletic facilities, and sponsored the 
purchase of books and playground 
equipment. Through their entrepre-
neurship and philanthropy, Trails West 
has become a testament to Idaho’s 
thriving small business culture and 
shines as one of the State’s many local 
gems. 
Congratulations to the entire Trails 
West team on being selected as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
December 2021. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

GOVERNMENT 
OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMER-
ICA, THE GOVERNMENT OF AUS-

OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF

PROPULSION 
INFORMATION—PM 19 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I am pleased to transmit to the Con-
gress, pursuant to section 123 d. of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 2153(d)), the text of an Agree-
ment between the Government of the 
United States of America, the Govern-
ment of Australia, and the Government 
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland (the ‘‘United 
Kingdom’’) for the Exchange of Naval 
Nuclear Propulsion Information (the 
‘‘Agreement’’). I am also pleased to 
transmit my written approval, author-
ization, and determination concerning 
the Agreement. The memorandum sub-
mitted to me by the Secretary of En-
ergy providing a summary position on 
the Agreement is also enclosed. 
Pursuant to the enhanced trilateral 
security partnership called ‘‘AUKUS’’ 
announced earlier this year, our three 
governments are engaging in an 18- 
month consultation period to seek an 
optimal pathway for delivery of nu-
clear-powered 
submarines 
for 
the 
Royal Australian Navy at the earliest 
achievable date. The Agreement would 
permit the three Parties to commu-
nicate and exchange Naval Nuclear 
Propulsion Information and would pro-
vide authorization to share certain Re-
stricted Data as may be needed during 
trilateral discussions, thereby enabling 
full and effective consultations. 
In my judgment, the Agreement 
meets all statutory requirements. 
I have determined that the United 
Kingdom and Australia, by partici-
pating with the United States pursuant 
to 
international 
arrangements, 
are 
making substantial and material con-
tributions to the mutual defense and 
security. The United Kingdom is party 
to the North Atlantic Treaty, and Aus-
tralia is party to the Australia, New 
Zealand, and United States Security 
Treaty. 
I have approved the Agreement, au-
thorized its execution, and urge that 
the Congress give it favorable consider-
ation.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–94. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress to oppose unneces-
sary and harmful changes to Internal Rev-
enue Service reporting requirements for 
Michigan’s financial institutions; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 85 
Whereas, The U.S. Department of Treasury 
has proposed requiring financial institutions 
to report financial account information for 
accounts with a gross flow threshold or fair 
market value of $600 or more. The proposal 
calls for financial institutions to report 
gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown 
for physical cash, transactions with foreign 
accounts, and transfers to and from another 
account with the same owner. It would apply 
to business and personal accounts, including 
bank, loan, and investment accounts at 
those financial institutions subject to the 
proposed requirement; and 
Whereas, there are very real concerns over 
data privacy and security if this proposed In-
ternal Revenue Service reporting require-
ment, or a similar requirement, is put in 
place. Keeping member and customer ac-
count information private and secure is 
among the primary goals of all financial in-
stitutions in Michigan and this proposal 
could jeopardize the security of accounts and 
personal information. As we have seen, nu-
merous government data breaches have oc-
curred in recent years. Moreover, the pro-
posal constitutes an invasion of consumer 
privacy; and 
Whereas, Financial institutions through-
out our state and country are already sub-
ject to many burdensome regulations that 
increase costs, damage customer relations, 
and otherwise hurt these businesses. The 
adoption of this extensive and intrusive fi-
nancial reporting proposal would deepen that 
burden for Michigan’s community-based and 
other financial institutions; now, there, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
United States Congress to oppose unneces-
sary and harmful changes to Internal Rev-
enue Service reporting requirements for 
Michigan’s financial institutions; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, and mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion, and the chairs of the United States

Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 174 
Whereas, The U.S. Department of Treasury 
has proposed requiring financial institutions 
to report financial account information for 
accounts with a gross flow threshold or fair 
market value of $600 or more. The proposal 
calls for financial institutions to report 
gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown 
for physical cash, transactions with foreign 
accounts, and transfers to and from another 
account with the same owner. It would apply 
to business and personal accounts, including 
bank, loan, and investment accounts at 
those financial institutions subject to the 
proposed requirement; and 
Whereas, There are very real concerns over 
data privacy and security if this proposed In-
ternal Revenue Service reporting require-
ment, or a similar requirement, is put in 
place. Keeping member and customer ac-
count information private and secure is 
among the primary goals of all financial in-
stitutions in Michigan and this proposal 
could jeopardize the security of accounts and 
personal information. As we have seen, nu-
merous government data breaches have oc-
curred in recent years. Moreover, the pro-
posal constitutes an invasion of consumer 
privacy; and 
Whereas, Financial institutions through-
out our state and country are already sub-
ject to many burdensome regulations that 
increase costs, damage customer relations, 
and otherwise hurt these businesses. The 
adoption of this extensive and intrusive fi-
nancial reporting proposal would deepen that 
burden for Michigan’s community-based and 
other financial institutions; now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the United States Congress to 
oppose unnecessary and harmful changes to 
Internal Revenue Service reporting require-
ments for Michigan’s financial institutions; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
State House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United State Senate, the mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion, and the chairs of the United States 
Senate Committee on Finance and United 
States House Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
POM–96. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Michigan 
demanding the President of the United 
States and the United States Congress pro-
vide no support to the Taliban, either direct 
or indirect, including but not limited to aid; 
to the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 177 
Whereas, Over the past 20 years, the United 
States has provided billions of dollars in for-
eign aid to Afghanistan. The foreign aid had 
been used to help Afghan leaders establish a 
stable government and support the human 
rights of Afghan citizens; and 
Whereas, Despite the billions of dollars 
that the United States provided Afghanistan 
in foreign aid, Taliban fighters overran sev-
eral provincial capitals less than two weeks 
after the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops 
from the country. This led to the departure 
of Afghanistan’s president and the total col-
lapse of the established government; and 
Whereas, Attempting to use money as le-
verage to persuade the Taliban will prove to 
be futile and dangerous. The Taliban, unlike 
the previous Afghan leaders, have no reason 
to prioritize the stability and safety of the 
Afghan people. Providing financial support 
to Afghanistan would only strengthen the 
Taliban’s efforts to terrorize its citizens and 
smother revolutions in their crib; Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the House of Representatives, 
That we demand that President Biden and 
the United States Congress provide no sup-
port to the Taliban, either direct or indirect, 
including but not limited to aid; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the President of the United 
States Senate, and the Michigan congres-
sional delegation. 
POM–97. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan supporting the 
religious liberty of Michigan citizens; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 88 
Whereas, The Declaration of Independence 
affirms that people are ‘‘. . . endowed by 
their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, 
and the pursuit of Happiness . . .’’; and de-
clares that governments derive ‘‘their just 
powers from the consent of the governed 
. . .’’; and 
Whereas, The First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States clearly, 
plainly, and unequivocally states that ‘‘Con-
gress shall make no law respecting an estab-
lishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of 
speech . . .’’. The constitutional protection 
of these bedrock principles of religious lib-
erty and freedom of expression was extended 
to the actions of the states through the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States; and 
Whereas, The Michigan Constitution un-
ambiguously affirms that ‘‘[e]very person 
shall be at liberty to worship God according 
to the dictates of his own conscience’’; and 
that ‘‘[t]he civil and political rights, privi-
leges and capacities of no person shall be di-
minished . . . on account of his religious be-
lief’’ and that ‘‘[e]very person may freely 
speak, write, express and publish his views 
on all subjects’’ and ‘‘no law shall be enacted 
to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech 
. . .’’; and 
Whereas, Despite the clear prohibition 
against government actions infringing upon 
freedom of expression and the free exercise 
of religion, religious people and religious or-
ganizations have been frequent targets of 
governmental actions by state and local gov-
ernment officials seeking to limit religious 
expression and exercise, including by execu-
tive orders that close houses of worship, 
mandates that effectively prohibit religious 
student athletes from participating in colle-
giate sports, and policies that exclude reli-
gious families and organizations from foster 
care programs; and 
Whereas, Religious expression is essential 
for maintaining societal morality. As George 
Washington stated, ‘‘Let us with caution in-
dulge the supposition that morality can be 
maintained without religion. Reason and ex-
perience both forbid us to expect that na-
tional morality can prevail in exclusion of 
religious principle’’; and 
Whereas, When religious-based ideas in-
form the public ethic, society benefits great-
ly. For example, the idea that God created 
humans in His image, and that all human 
life has dignity, significantly contributed to 
ending slavery and advancing the rights of 
women and minorities. Censuring an idea 
that is informed by ancient sacred tenets 
prevents thousands of years of wisdom from 
informing the public ethic; and 
Whereas, In this country, individuals, 
houses of worship, and religious organiza-
tions compelled by their religious beliefs 
have served the needy, the homeless, widows, 
and orphans long before government and 
continue to partner with government to 
serve our communities. Indeed, this is a vital 
notion in our pluralistic society: The ability 
and freedom of Americans of any faith—or 
no faith at all—to be free to serve in ways 
consistent with the commitments that in-
spire their service in the first place; and 
Whereas, A moral republic cannot function 
without religious expression. Government 
suppression of a citizen’s religious expression 
or religious exercise sends a bitter chill 
throughout the citizenry in a republic. In-
stead of censuring or punishing religious 
speech or religious conscience, the answer in 
a republic valuing freedom must always be 
to foster and support expression; and 
Whereas, The test of a functioning moral 
republic is not only whether government 
protects speech and religious expression with 
which it agrees—it is whether government 
will protect speech and religious expression 
with which it disagrees. The constitutional 
liberty here does not protect governments 
from religious conscience—it protects the 
exercise of religious conscience from govern-
ment infringement. When government sup-
presses or punishes a citizen’s religious ex-
pression or conscience, it betrays the funda-
mental principle of freedom on which our 
country was founded; and 
Whereas, Good governance and civic insti-
tutional integrity rest on the virtue of its 
citizens. Religious ideas support and nurture 
this virtue and should, therefore, always be 
permitted within the marketplace of ideas; 
and 
Whereas, it is the duty of elected officials 
to uphold the Constitution of the United 
States and the Michigan Constitution; Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we support the 
religious liberty of Michigan citizens; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That we will not infringe upon 
the ability of citizens to act in accordance 
with their religious conscience and beliefs; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That we will not tolerate persecu-
tion of religious people because of their be-
liefs; and be it further 
Resolved, That we condemn any behavior 
by government authorities that limits the 
ability of individuals to express their reli-
gious conscience and beliefs; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Governor, the Michigan 
Attorney General, the Michigan Secretary of 
State, the President of the United States, 
the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives, and the members of the 
Michigan congressional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 3297. A bill for the relief of Shirley 
Constantino Tan; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am reintroducing a bill for the 
private relief of Shirley Constantino 
Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina national liv-
ing in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud 
mother 
of 
20-year-old 
twin 
boys, 
Jashley and Joriene, who are U.S. citi-
zens. She is married to Jay Mercado, a 
naturalized U.S. citizen. 
Ms. Tan faces deportation to the 
Philippines, which would separate her 
from her family and jeopardize her 
safety. 
I 
believe 
Ms. 
Tan 
merits 
Congress’s special consideration for 
this extraordinary form of relief be-
cause her removal from the United 
States would cause serious, undue 
hardship for her and her family. 
Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence 
in the Philippines before she came to 
the United States. When she was only 
14 years old, Ms. Tan’s cousin murdered 
Ms. Tan’s mother and sister and shot 
Ms. Tan in the head. The cousin was 
eventually prosecuted, but he received 
a short jail sentence. Fearing for her 
safety, Ms. Tan fled the Philippines 
just before her cousin was due to be re-
leased from jail. She entered the 
United States legally on a visitor’s visa 
in 1989. 
Ms. Tan faces a deportation order be-
cause of negligent counsel. Ms. Tan ap-
plied for asylum in 1995. When her case 
went before the Board of Immigration 
Appeals, her attorney was supposed to 
file a brief in support of her case, but 
the attorney failed to do so. As a re-
sult, the Board of Immigration Appeals 
dismissed Ms. Tan’s case and granted 
her 
voluntary 
departure 
from 
the 
United States. 
However, Ms. Tan’s negligent counsel 
never notified Ms. Tan that the Board 
of Immigration Appeals issued an order 
granting her voluntary departure. Be-
cause she did not know about the 
order, Ms. Tan did not depart the 
United States, so the grant of vol-
untary departure automatically led to 
a removal order. She learned about the 
deportation order for the first time on 
January 28, 2009, when Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement agents took 
her into immigration custody. 
Because of her attorney’s negligent 
actions, Ms. Tan was denied the oppor-
tunity to present her case in immigra-
tion proceedings. She later filed a com-
plaint against her former attorney, 
who had similar complaints from other 
clients, with the State Bar of Cali-
fornia. 
On 
February 
4, 
2015, 
Ms. 
Tan’s 
spouse, Mr. Mercado, a U.S. citizen, 
filed an approved spousal petition on 
her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services 
denied her application due to the fact 
that she still had a final order of re-
moval. Ms. Tan must go back to the 
immigration court and ask for the 
court to terminate her case and then 
reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan 
still faces the threat of deportation 
while she seeks to close her case before 
an immigration court. 
In addition to the hardship that 
would come to Ms. Tan if she is de-
ported, her deportation would be a 
major loss to her community and 
would cause serious hardship for her 
two children, Jashley and Joriene, who 
are U.S. citizens. 
Ms. Tan used to run an in-home 
daycare, and she is now a homemaker 
caring for her husband and two sons. 
Ms. Tan and her family are heavily in-
volved in their community in Pacifica 
and own their own home. The family 
attends and volunteers at Good Shep-
herd Catholic Church. They also volun-
teer with the Mother Theresa of Cal-
cutta’s Daughters of Charity. Ms. Tan 
has the support of dozens of members 
of her community who have shared 
with me the family’s spirit of commit-
ment to their community. 
Joriene is a junior at Stanford Uni-
versity and is premed, majoring in 
human biology. In addition to his stud-
ies, Joriene is involved in Stanford’s 
Pilipino 
American 
Student 
Union. 
Jashley is a junior at Chapman Univer-
sity, majoring in business administra-
tion. 
If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the 
United States, her family has stated 
that they would go with her to the 
Philippines or try to find a third coun-
try where the entire family could relo-
cate together. This would mean that 
Jashley and Joriene would have to 
leave behind their education and the 
only home they have known. 
I do not believe it is in our Nation’s 
best interest to force this family, with 
two U.S. citizen children, to make the 
choice between being separated or relo-
cating to a country where they may 
face safety concerns or other serious 
hardships. 
Enactment of the legislation I am in-
troducing on behalf of Ms. Tan will en-
able this entire family to continue 
their lives in California and make posi-
tive contributions to their community. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to 
support this private bill. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

SUPPORTING 
THE 
FOUNDATION 
FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES 
OF HEALTH AND THE REAGAN- 
UDALL 
FOUNDATION 
FOR 
THE 
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRA-
TION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 3743, the ‘‘Supporting the 
Foundation for the National Institutes of Health 
and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food 
and Drug Administration Act,’’ bipartisan legis-
lation I’m proud to co-lead with Rep. Hudson. 
The Foundation for the National Institutes of 
Health (FNIH) and the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion for the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) are exemplary models on how to align 
public and private partners around a common 
cause, to advance breakthroughs in bio-
medical discoveries. 
The FNIH organizes key research partner-
ships to address critical issues of our time 
such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and 
global health. Since its formation in 1990, the 
FNIH has established the Accelerating Medi-
cines Partnership program, the Biomarkers 
Consortium, 
the 
Alzheimer’s 
Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, and the GeneConvene 
Global Collaborative. Most recently, the FNIH 
helped to address the pandemic by launching 
and coordinating the Accelerating COVID–19 
Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines initia-
tive in partnership with numerous government 
agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and bio-
pharmaceutical 
companies. 
This 
initiative 
played a significant role in speeding the avail-
ability of the highly effective Moderna mRNA 
vaccine. 
The Reagan-Udall Foundation creates ro-
bust public-private partnerships to advance re-
search and innovation, enhance medical deci-
sion-making, and empower patients and advo-
cates. The Foundation also helps patients 
navigate clinical trials, benefit from the ex-
panded access process, and participate in Lis-
tening Sessions with the FDA to provide their 
personal insights about the challenges of living 
with a specific disease. 
H.R. 3743 ensures that these foundations 
continue to have the resources needed for 
their important work. This legislation increases 
the amount of funding the NIH and the FDA 
can transfer and allocate to their respective 
foundations. 
These foundations make contributions to 
biomedical research every day and I’m 
pleased to co-lead H.R. 3743 and urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
DR. RACHEL HERLIHY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Rachel Herlihy, State 
Epidemiologist for the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) for 
her dedication and service to the people of the 
State of Colorado. Throughout the COVID–19 
pandemic, Dr. Herlihy went above and beyond 
to engage, educate and inform the community 
about COVID–19, including by participating in 
many Telephone Town Halls with my office 
and thousands of my constituents. 
Dr. Herlihy has served the constituents of 
Colorado in her role since 2015. During our 
Telephone Town Halls, Dr. Herlihy provided 
timely updates on COVID–19 and answered 
constituent’s questions regarding how to pro-
tect themselves and their families during an 
uncertain time. Her insights and knowledge 
were invaluable to my office and my constitu-
ents. 
It is because of local heroes like Dr. Herlihy 
that our state has been able to protect its resi-
dents and keep our community safe. I thank 
Dr. Rachel Herlihy for her service and her sac-
rifice during this difficult time, and I look for-
ward to continuing to work with her as we con-
tinue the fight against COVID–19 and its 
variants.

RECOGNIZING DEPUTY ZACHARY 
BELLINGHAM 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the valiant 
and brave actions of Deputy Zachary Bel-
lingham of the Craven County Sheriff’s Office. 
On October 1, 2021, Deputy Bellingham 
sustained life-threatening injuries while serving 
in the line of duty. Following his injuries, Dep-
uty Bellingham was taken to Carolina East 
Medical Center and then airlifted to Vidant 
Medical Center in Greenville to receive emer-
gency surgery. Deputy Bellingham has contin-
ued his rehabilitation at Shepherd Medical 
Center in Atlanta, where he has shown strong 
perseverance in his recovery. I am hopeful 
that as a man of deep valor and courage he 
will quickly recover. 
The conduct and actions of Deputy Bel-
lingham embodies the values of a true Amer-
ican hero. His brave actions on that fateful day 
highlight the very best of our law enforcement 
and all that they do to protect their commu-
nities. I am also grateful for the immense sup-
port offered by those in the community as 
Deputy Bellingham continues with his recov-
ery. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in express-
ing my sincere gratitude and appreciation to 
Deputy Bellingham for his commitment to pro-
tecting those in his community and wishing 
him a full and speedy recovery.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
ELAINE ROGERS, CEO OF USO- 
METROPOLITAN 
WASHINGTON- 
BALTIMORE 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
thank 
former 
USO-Metropolitan 
Washington-Baltimore CEO Elaine Rogers for 
her service to our community and congratulate 
her on her upcoming retirement. 
Elaine was first hired by the USO-Metro 
chapter in 1976 and was quickly elevated to 
the role of Executive Director the following 
year. 
Over the course of her remarkable career, 
she led the expansion of the USO-Metro to 
support 29 military installations across the Na-
tional Capital Region. 
For her tireless dedication to members of 
the U.S. Armed Forces and their families, 
Elaine has been recognized by the U.S. Army, 
Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force with serv-
ice awards and medals. 
I don’t know anyone with the same energy 
and dedication as Elaine Rogers. I first met 
Elaine in 2007 as she annually brought the 
USO to Cincinnati, where thousands came to-
gether to support our troops. 
Elaine is a dedicated wife, mother, and 
grandmother, and I know she is looking for-
ward to spending more time with her family in 
retirement. 
She has served with diligence and integrity 
throughout her distinguished career. She is 
the ultimate patriot, and as they say, a real 
‘‘Yankee-Doodle Dandy.’’ 
I thank Elaine again and wish her the best 
in her retirement. A grateful Nation salutes 
her.

epidemic and to celebrate the monument’s 
renovation, which includes the addition of 
more than 1,000 new names of community 
members we have lost to AIDS. 
The Wall Las Memorias AIDS Monument is 
the only publicly funded AIDS monument in 
the country. Its rededication marks a momen-
tous occasion in my district, honoring the com-
munity members we lost to the HIV epidemic 
and highlighting the efforts of those who have 
fought to end it. 
Today, we stand with our local and inter-
national community and show our support to 
the people living with HIV. It is estimated that 
over 38 million people worldwide are living 
with the virus, which means that there is still 
work to be done to advance awareness, pre-
vention, inclusion, and equity to ensure better 
health for all people affected by HIV and 
AIDS. 
I would like to thank The Wall Las Memorias 
Project for rededicating this monument on 
World AIDS Day as well as providing re-
sources and support to those that are dis-
proportionately affected by the virus. 
Let us continue to remember those we have 
lost to AIDS and support those currently living 
with HIV. May our community find comfort in 
celebrating life on World AIDS Day.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 96TH AN-
NUAL TREK TO THE NATION’S 
CHRISTMAS TREE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Sanger Chamber of Com-
merce’s Annual Trek to the Nation’s Christmas 
Tree Ceremony at Kings Canyon National 
Park. 
The General Grant Tree, growing in the 
Kings Canyon National Park, is said to be 
over 1,650 years old. On April 28, 1926, at the 
request of the citizens of Sanger, the General 
Grant Tree was dedicated by the Federal Gov-
ernment as the Nation’s Christmas Tree. 
Thanks to the dedication and interest from 
the great residents of Sanger, the Nation’s 
Christmas Tree is renown across the country 
and the world. Sanger, California, was recog-
nized as the Nation’s Christmas Tree City by 
the Post Office Department on October 1, 
1949. 
The General Grant Tree is a constant re-
minder of the sacrifices of the men and 
women of the Armed Forces who have 
served, fought, and died to keep our nation 
free. This national shrine preserves the spir-
itual, human, and civil rights upon which 
America was founded. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the Sanger Chamber of Commerce in 
celebration of the 96th Annual Trek to the Na-
tion’s Christmas Tree. 
HEALTH BILLS UNDER 
CONSIDERATION 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of seven bills that originated in 
the Health Subcommittee of Energy & Com-
merce. I’m proud of my Subcommittee’s bipar-
tisan work on these critical bills which tackle 
hard problems, including substance use treat-
ment, vaccine access, and the social inequi-
ties that result in poor health outcomes, espe-
cially for mothers and people of color. 
Two of the bills we’re considering help ad-
dress the overdose crisis our nation currently 
faces. According to the CDC, overdose deaths 
spiked after the start of the pandemic. There 
were 93,000 overdose deaths in 2020, a 30 
percent increase from the year prior, making 
2020 the deadliest year for overdoses on 
record, with synthetic opioids the primary driv-
er of the overall increase in overdose deaths 
across America. 
H.R. 
2355, 
the 
‘‘Opioid 
Prescription 
Verification Act of 2021,’’ enables HHS and 
the CDC to help combat this urgent overdose 
epidemic by facilitating responsible, informed 
dispensing of controlled substances. I thank 
my colleagues Reps. RODNEY DAVIS, GUS BILI-
RAKIS, and ANN WAGNER for authoring this leg-
islation. 
H.R. 2364, the ‘‘Synthetic Opioid Danger 
Awareness Act,’’ directs the CDC to conduct a 
public awareness campaign on the dangers of 
synthetic opioids and available treatments. It 
also requires the National Institute for Occupa-
tional Safety and Health to make educational 
materials for first responders about synthetic 
opioid exposure prevention. I thank my col-
leagues Reps. ANDY KIM and CHRIS PAPPAS 
for authoring this legislation. 
The next three bills aim to ensure that every 
American, no matter their age. race, or in-
come, are empowered to receive the ‘‘dose of 
hope’’ from vaccine protection. As we’ve seen 
during the pandemic, there are lifesaving ben-
efits of safe, effective, and free vaccines. 
H.R. 951, the ‘‘Maternal Vaccination Act,’’ 
helps to enhance maternal health care quality 
and outcomes. It authorizes $2 million annu-
ally for the next four years to increase aware-
ness of the importance of combatting vaccine- 
preventable infection diseases during preg-
nancy. In the United States, pregnant women 
and infants are disproportionately susceptible 
to complications of infectious diseases such 
as influenza and whooping cough. Available 
vaccine data shows that vaccinations against 
these diseases confer protection to both moth-
ers and newborns with no increased risk of 
adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes, and 
they are highly recommended by the CDC. I 
thank my colleague Rep. TERRI SEWELL for au-
thoring this legislation. 
H.R. 550, the ‘‘Immunization Infrastructure 
Modernization Act of 2021,’’ will create a na-
tional policy framework and provide resources 
to improve immunization information systems 
allowing for better management of routine vac-
cinations and enhancing our public health re-
sponse to future pandemics. I thank my col-
leagues Reps. ANN
KUSTER
and LARRY 
BUCSHON for their leadership authoring this 
legislation. 
H.R. 1550, the ‘‘PREVENT HPV Cancers 
Act of 2021,’’ will create a national CDC public 
awareness campaign targeted to communities 
with the lowest HPV vaccination rates to in-
crease vaccinations and prevent HPV cancers. 
I thank my colleague Rep. KATHY CASTOR for 
her leadership authoring this legislation. 
The final two bills address social inequities 
that result in poor health outcomes and hurt 
the most vulnerable amongst us. 
H.R. 4026, the ‘‘Social Determinants of 
Health Data Analysis Act of 2021,’’ calls for a 
GAO report on the HHS Secretary’s actions to 
help inform Congress’ next steps in address-
ing the factors that are at the heart of the 
health disparities across the country. I thank 
my colleagues Reps. MICHAEL BURGESS and 
LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER for authoring this leg-
islation. 
H.R. 3894, the ‘‘CARING for Social Deter-
minants Act of 2021,’’ directs the HHS to pro-
vide guidance to states on how to address so-
cial determinants of health through Medicaid 
and CHIP. I thank my colleagues Reps. LISA 
BLUNT ROCHESTER and GUS BILIRAKIS for au-
thoring this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for these bills 
and I thank the members of the House Health 
Subcommittee and the bipartisan sponsors of 
each bill for their good work.

TRIBUTE TO DR. STEVE AARON 
WILSON 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a life-long educator who 
has had a tremendous impact on the students 
of South Carolina. It is my honor to congratu-
late Dr. Steve Wilson, as he retires after more 
than 50 years of service to public education. 
He leaves a legacy of excellence that will con-
tinue to benefit future generations. 
Dr. Wilson was born in Fairfield County, 
South Carolina, the oldest of nine children 
born to Aaron and Lugenia Wilson. From an 
early age, his parents instilled in him the im-
portance of education to rise above the mod-
est means of his childhood. Dr. Wilson grad-
uated from McCrorey-Liston High School in 
Blair, South Carolina, where he excelled in 
academics and athletics. 
He was able to secure scholarships, work 
study, financial aid and student loans to pay 
for his higher education at Benedict College in 
Columbia, South Carolina. There he earned a 
degree in biology and built friendships and re-
lationships that lasted throughout his life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1293 
December 1, 2021 
While a student, he joined the Omega Psi Phi 
Fraternity, and I am proud to call him a broth-
er. 
Immediately after graduating in 1972, Dr. 
Wilson was drafted into the U.S. Army, where 
he served on active duty for two years before 
joining the Reserves. He rose to the rank of 
Major and served as Personnel Officer of his 
battalion. His military service lasted a total of 
15 years, and provided him significant oppor-
tunities to travel and learn from people with 
different backgrounds and experiences. 
Following his active duty military service, Dr. 
Wilson returned to his high school to teach 
science and agriculture. At the same time, he 
used the GI Bill to earn a master’s degree in 
agriculture from Clemson University. While 
teaching, he became interested in school lead-
ership, and began studying for an Ed.S. in 
School Administration at Winthrop University. 
He later transferred to South Carolina State 
University, where he completed an Ed.D. in 
Educational Leadership in 2001. 
In addition to beginning his career as a 
teacher at his alma mater, Dr. Wilson served 
in the administrations of Winnsboro/Fairfield 
Central High School, Orangeburg-Wilkinson 
High School, Newberry High School, W.J. 
Keenan High School, and Richland School 
District One. Today, he serves as Super-
intendent for Calhoun County Public Schools, 
from which he is retiring after eleven years of 
service. 
His accomplishments include being named 
the first Black principal of Newberry High 
School where he served for six years and 
oversaw the school’s strong academic per-
formance. While serving as principal of Keen-
an High School, Dr. Wilson was named South 
Carolina Principal of the Year in 2003. He 
oversaw 
the 
school 
becoming 
the 
first 
Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathe-
matics (STEM) School in the district while 
partnering with the University of South Caro-
lina’s 
Engineering 
School. 
Keenan 
High 
School was also named a Palmetto’s Finest 
High School for the State of South Carolina, 
and the school, which serves a disadvantaged 
population, made school history with 15 Black 
students attaining a 100 percent pass rate on 
the AP Math exam. 
In 2010, he became Superintendent of the 
Calhoun County School District, which was 
rated At Risk on the District’s Report Card. 
Within two years, he led the district to an Ex-
cellent rating. He oversaw the district’s pur-
chase of digital devices for every student from 
3rd through 12th grades, and was named 
South Carolina Superintendent of the Year in 
2017 for his accomplishments. 
During his career, Dr. Wilson served on var-
ious committees including the Executive Com-
mittee of the South Carolina High School 
League, the Education Oversight Committee, 
and the State’s Summer Leadership Con-
ference Committee. He also received the Gov-
ernor’s Order of the Silver Crescent in 2004 
and was named an outstanding graduate from 
the School of Leadership at South Carolina 
State University the same year. This year, Dr. 
Wilson was awarded the Lifetime Achievement 
Award by the South Carolina Association of 
School Administrators. 
Dr. Wilson is married to his high school 
sweetheart, Teresa Hendrix Wilson, who also 
taught high school students for thirty years. 
They have two children, Teresa and Steven, 
and three granddaughters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the tremen-
dous work of Dr. Wilson. He exemplifies a 
commitment to service and a champion of 
education. His example has been a beacon for 
many students that have had the opportunity 
of learning in classrooms, schools, and dis-
tricts under his leadership. Dr. Wilson’s reach 
is immeasurable, and I wish him all the best 
as he embarks on the retirement he so richly 
deserves.

DANIEL CHASE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Daniel Chase, Chief of 
Staff at the Colorado Department of Labor and 
Employment (CDLE) for his dedication and 
service to the people of the State of Colorado. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, Daniel 
went above and beyond to engage, educate 
and inform the community about unemploy-
ment benefits, including by participating in 
many Telephone Town Halls with my office 
and thousands of my constituents. 
Under Governor Hickenlooper’s office, Dan-
iel served as a Citizen’s Advocate and then 
was brought on by CDLE as a Special Assist-
ant to the Executive Director. In his time at the 
department, he has held many roles and now 
serves as the Chief of Staff in the Executive 
Director’s office. During our Telephone Town 
Halls, Daniel provided timely updates and an-
swered constituent questions about unemploy-
ment benefit programs related to the COVID– 
19 pandemic in Colorado. 
It is because of local heroes like Daniel that 
our state has been able to support individuals 
and families during this unprecedented time. I 
thank Daniel Chase for his service and sac-
rifice during this difficult time, and I look for-
ward to continuing to work with him as we 
work to emerge from the COVID–19 pan-
demic.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
SEAMAN 
SECOND 
CLASS 
CHARLES LOUIS ‘‘SONNY BOY’’ 
SAUNDERS 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of Navy Seaman Second Class 
Charles Louis ‘‘Sonny Boy’’ Saunders of 
Winnie, Texas. Seaman Saunders was serving 
aboard the USS Oklahoma (BB–37) on the 
morning of December 7, 1941. Tragically, the 
Oklahoma sustained 429 casualties during the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, claiming Mr. Saun-
ders’ life. After eight decades, the Defense 
POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has 
identified Seaman Saunders’ remains. This 
year, he will be reinterred in his hometown on 
the 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. 
Mr. Saunders was born to Mortimer Alvin 
and Melina Falke Saunders on October 16, 
1923; He was the sixth child and one of four 
boys. His oldest brother, Adam, passed away 
at just 13 months. He grew up with his sisters 
Lillie Mae, Mary Alice, Sadie Lee, and Anna 
Belle along with brothers Sidney ‘‘Buddy’’ Ed-
ward and Mortimer Virgil. 
The Great Depression led to difficult times 
as his father worked in construction and la-
bored in rice fields to provide for his family, 
while his mother cared for the home and 
raised their children. Mr. Saunders’ younger 
sister, Anna Belle, always spoke of her broth-
er’s compassion, and how he sacrificed so 
she could have shoes for her daily walk to 
school. He could not bear to see his little sis-
ter struggle in any manner. 
His kind, caring, and playful nature fueled 
his ambition to serve our nation. On Novem-
ber 23, 1940, one month after his 17th birth-
day, he joined the U.S. Navy. Not only did he 
possess a deep desire to defend our country, 
but he also had great determination to make 
a better life for his parents and siblings. 
On December 7, 1941, Japanese aircraft 
launched an attack on the American fleet of 
battleships moored at Pearl Harbor, thrusting 
the United States into the Second World War. 
After Seaman Saunders’ warship capsized be-
cause of damage from multiple Japanese tor-
pedoes, his whereabouts were unknown. Ac-
cording to a casualty roster of the Oklahoma 
compiled two weeks after the attack, Seaman 
Saunders’ status was labeled as ‘‘missing’’ but 
later amended to ‘‘killed in action.’’ 
Those who perished aboard the USS Okla-
homa were buried at two different cemeteries: 
the Halawa and Nu’uanu Naval Cemeteries in 
Hawaii. Most of the remains were recovered 
during salvage operations but were unable to 
be identified before their interment, and there-
fore, they were buried as ‘‘unknowns.’’ 
In recognition of his service, Seaman Saun-
ders was awarded a Purple Heart for military 
merit and three ribbons for American Defense, 
American Campaign, and the Asiatic Pacific 
Campaign. However, these awards seemed to 
be a lost memory uncovered after family mem-
bers 
found 
his 
commendations 
carefully 
tucked away in a box left inside his mother’s 
old sewing machine. 
As the last living sibling, Anna Belle was 
committed to bringing her brother home and 
laying him to rest at the gravesite their parents 
prepared for him years ago at Fairview Ceme-
tery in Winnie, Texas. In 2015, the DPAA was 
given authority to exhume the unknown re-
mains of the servicemen associated with the 
USS Oklahoma and to reexamine them using 
advanced forensic technology. It was at this 
point that the military contacted Anna Belle. 
She worked tirelessly to gather and provide 
DNA of family members to help identify her 
brother’s remains. 
Unfortunately, she passed away on July 19, 
2019, but never lost hope that her brother 
would one day return home. She prayed her 
unwavering mission would be continued by 
those who survived her, and it was. On Feb-
ruary 11, 2021, the Saunders family received 
word that their long-lost relative had finally 
been found and identified. 
Madam Speaker, Seaman Second Class 
Charles ‘‘Sonny Boy’’ Saunders’ arrival in 
Winnie, Texas, will be welcomed by many rel-
atives, friends, and fellow patriots. On the 80th 
anniversary of his passing, Mr. Saunders will 
be buried alongside his parents with full mili-
tary honors. May God continue to bless this 
family for their long record of service and sac-
rifice to our great nation.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

rector of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) in Colorado for her dedication and serv-
ice to the people of the State of Colorado. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, Francis

many of my Telephone Town Halls to educate 
my constituents about small business support 
and resources. 
Francis has served the constituents of Colo-
rado in her current role since 2017. As District 
Director, she is responsible for directing the 
expansion and delivery of SBA’s various loan 
and business training services throughout the 
State of Colorado. Prior to her current posi-
tion, she was the Deputy District Director 
where she led the Entrepreneurial Develop-
ment and Lender Relations divisions in the 
Colorado office and managed the agency’s re-

partners, local government officials, and eco-
nomic development organizations. Throughout

timely updates related to small businesses re-
lief programs and made herself available to 
my staff and my constituents around the clock. 
Her insights and knowledge were invaluable to

ing this unprecedented time. I thank Francis 
Padilla for her service and her sacrifice during 
this difficult time, and I look forward to con-

RECOGNIZING 
MAYOR 
WILSON 
‘‘EDDIE’’ BARBER OF EMERALD 
ISLE, NORTH CAROLINA 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of a devoted 
public servant in our community who will retire 
at the end of this year, Mayor Wilson ‘‘Eddie’’ 
Barber of Emerald Isle, North Carolina. A self-
less and dedicated minister and town Mayor, 
Mr. Barber has been in the service of others 
for the past 40 years. 
Beginning in 1969, Mayor Barber com-
menced his service as a minister performing 
services throughout eastern North Carolina 
until 2015. Nearing the end of his ministerial 
years, Mayor Barber soon devoted his career 
to public service, where he served as a mem-
ber on the Emerald Isle Land Use Steering 
Committee and Emerald Isle Planning Board 
from 2004 until 2013. Concurrently, from 2009 
until 2013, he served as Vice-Chair of the 
Planning Board. During this time, Mayor Bar-
ber was a tenured and established public 
servant with many accomplishments under his 
belt and a name recognized by everyone in 
Emerald Isle. 
After years of civil service on municipal 
boards and committees, Mayor Barber was 
elected Mayor of Emerald Isle in 2013 and re- 
elected in 2017. Currently, Mayor Barber is a 
member of the Carteret County Tourism De-
velopment Authority, and was the past Chair 
of the Down East RPO, and past Chair Person 
of the Crystal Coast Mayors Association. He 
has also been involved with the Emerald Isle 
Business Association, Hope for the Warriors, 
and served on the Board of Directors of Meth-
odist University. As a tenured mayor, Mayor 
Barber was able to allocate $37 Million to-
wards beach re-nourishment initiatives at no 
expense to tax payers. He and the board also 
made sure to work closely and diligently to 
keep Emerald Isle’s reputation as a welcoming 
and family friendly beach town. This was all 
accomplished through several hardships that 
struck the community such as Hurricane Flor-
ence, Hurricane Dorian, and the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the retirement of this incredible and noble man 
and wishing Mayor Eddie Barber a happy re-
tirement from his life of public service.

HONORING MARK LARET 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Mark Laret, retiring President 
and Chief Executive Officer of the University 
of California San Francisco Health and a 
treasured friend. The San Francisco Giants re-
cently announced that Buster Posey is retiring. 
For those who understand Mark Laret and his 
role at UCSF Health, the departure of Mark is 
equally earthshaking. 
Mark Laret is a 1980 Regents Scholar grad-
uate of UCLA. He earned his Master’s in Polit-
ical Science from the University of Southern 
California. He joined UCLA Medical Center in 
1980 and worked his way up the ranks, and 
then transferred to UC Irvine. After Irvine, he 
came to UCSF and never left. 
Mark arrived at UCSF Health after a dis-
appointing attempt to merge with Stanford 
Health. At a time when the two organizations 
decided to end their merger, and many saw 
UCSF Health as the weaker partner, Mark 
took an $86 million deficit at the merged entity 
and produced a turnaround for UCSF Health. 
It wasn’t easy, and he later remarked, ‘‘I think 
when you are faced with a very difficult turn-
around situation, the first thing you do is listen, 
and let people vent, hear them out—hear their 
take on what went wrong, and what caused 
the issue . . . . [hear] what they’re proud of 
about the place they work, what they think 
those strong core assets are. What do they 
want to see change, what’s their hope for the 
future?’’ What faculty and labor wanted was 
new management. 
A new executive team was recruited, and it 
operates under what Mark calls PRIDE (Pro-
fessionalism, Respect, Integrity, Diversity and 
Excellence). UCSF’s commitment to quality 
patient care, operational efficiency, deep em-
ployee engagement, and health equity were 
formalized. Although it would take another 14 
years, equity remained a core value and was 
made concrete when UCSF acquired Oakland 
Children’s Hospital, now known as UCSF 
Benioff Children’s Hospital, Oakland. A new 
capital campaign to update that campus has 
begun. 
UCSF Health also focused on regional care 
and an expansion of research. To expand its 
research capacity, Mark and his board created 
an entirely new and state of the art campus at 
Mission Bay. From the remains of railroad 
tracks and industrial decay, UCSF Mission 
Bay rose to offer globally competitive research 
space and hospitals that serve the entire San 
Francisco Bay Area. $1.6 billion was needed 
by an institution that only a few years earlier 
was teetering on the edge of financial ruin. 
Mark is a visionary, and philanthropists from 
throughout the Bay Area supported that vision 
with $600 million in donations, matched by 
$700 million in borrowing and other funds. 
Today, the Mission Bay campus includes 
Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco, 
Bakar Cancer Hospital, Betty Irene Moore 
Women’s Hospital, and the Ron Conway Fam-
ily Gateway Medical Building. From birth to 
passing, relying heavily upon one of the 
globe’s premier research and training pro-
grams, UCSF Health provides first rate health 
care for the people of our region. 
I have known Mark Laret for decades dating

and its role in the Bay Area. He was an espe-
cially important advisor during our consider-
ation of the Affordable Care Act. He was al-
ways laser focused on providing the best pos-
sible care for as many Americans as possible 
while maneuvering the complex financing of 
our health care system. 
UCSF is a health machine built to fight a 
global pandemic. From early research into the 
technology that led to the vaccines to testing 
capacity and early healthcare directives, hav-
ing UCSF Health in San Francisco fighting 
SARS–CoV–2 
and 
its 
deadly 
progeny, 
COVID–19, likely saved thousands of lives in 
our region. Mark Laret has been the voice of 
authority, compassion, and leadership during 
this crisis and in every discussion about qual-
ity health care reform. In the many years that 
he has advised me, he was always trust-
worthy, informative, and persuasive. I have the 
deepest respect and admiration for his intellect 
and integrity. 
From a small research and treatment cam-
pus on a hill and a few isolated campuses 
elsewhere, to a bustling regional powerhouse 
and global standard setter, UCSF Health pros-
pered tremendously under the tenure of Mark 
Laret. After 21 years at the helm of this pres-
tigious healthcare institution, it’s now time to 
say goodbye to an historic leader. Let it be 
known that a humanitarian is retiring who can 
now spend more of his time with his beloved 
wife Jan Laret and their son Parker and 
daughter Casey. His duty having been accom-
plished with grace, his rest is justly earned.

RECOGNIZING DECEMBER 1ST AS 
WORLD AIDS DAY 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize December 
1, 2021, as World AIDS Day. This is the 33rd 
year that the world will come together to raise 
awareness about preventive measures for HIV 
and AIDS. 
World AIDS Day has been observed glob-
ally since 1988, bringing attention to the HIV 
epidemic and speaking out against the stigma 
surrounding HIV and AIDS. This day is a call 
to end the HIV epidemic in the United States 
and across the globe. This year’s theme of 
‘‘Ending the HIV Epidemic Equitable Access. 
Everyone’s Voice’’ emphasizes the signifi-
cance or working together to achieve an 
AIDS-free generation. Recent progress for 
prevention and treatment tools provides us 
with the unprecedented opportunity to end the 
epidemic. 
Since 2010, deaths from HIV/AIDS have 
fallen by 48 percent in the United States, but 
we still have work to do. We must continue to 
educate and spread awareness about HIV and 
AIDS prevention measures. Of the approxi-
mate 1.2 million people living with HIV in the 
United States, 13 percent do not know they 
have HIV. It is imperative to implement pro-
grams at the local level to diagnose, treat, pre-
vent, and respond to HIV. Together, we can 
end this. 
This is also a time to remember those we 
lost to HIV-related illnesses. The actions of 
groups across the country have helped bring 
us closer to our common goal. This year, the 
Rio Grande Valley’s own Basilica of Our Life 
San Juan del Valle will be commemorating the 
lives lost to HIV/AIDS and marking the 30th 
anniversary of this event founded by Francisco 
Mendez. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the hard work of those in South 
Texas and across the world to end the HIV 
epidemic and to recognize December 1, 2021, 
as World AIDS Day.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF ROYAL OAK, MICHI-
GAN 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join residents and city leaders 
past and present in celebrating the one hun-
dredth anniversary of the founding of Royal 
Oak, Michigan. 
On November 8, 1921, residents voted to 
adopt a city charter, turning the then Village of 
Royal Oak into the City of Royal Oak. At that 
time, they elected a mayor and a city commis-
sion, who brought the City of Royal Oak to 
life. The first Mayor of Royal Oak, George 
Dondero, had previously served the Village of 
Royal Oak, and later went on to be elected to 
the 73rd United States Congress. 
Over the past century, the City of Royal Oak 
has undergone a far-reaching transformation, 
and today is an energetic city filled with busi-
nesses, attractions, and almost 60,000 resi-
dents. It is now the eighth largest city in Oak-
land County and has been recognized as one 
of the most exciting, safest, and best places to 
live in Michigan. Royal Oak is home to a won-
derful public library, Oakland Community Col-
lege, the Detroit Zoological Park, Beaumont 
Hospital, and more than 50 public parks for all 
to enjoy. The City has made significant initia-
tives towards diversity and inclusion, towards 
green infrastructure and environmental friendli-
ness, and towards supporting the many small 
businesses in Royal Oak. On a personal note, 
Royal Oak is special to my family for another 
reason—my father, former U.S. Representa-
tive Sander Levin, is a longtime resident of the 
City and, like me, was proud to represent its 
residents in Congress. 
I have no doubt that the next century will 
bring continued achievements, growth, and 
prosperity to the City of Royal Oak and its 
people, and I invite my colleagues to join me 
in commemorating the centennial of this vi-
brant community in Michigan’s Ninth District.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
JAMES HANSON 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Robert James Hanson, a 
resident of La Honda, California, a beloved 
Menlo Park merchant and a longtime friend. 
Bob Hanson was born in Kansas on No-
vember 17, 1953, to Vivian and Robert Han-
son, and died on October 4, 2021, in Palo 
Alto, California. He is survived by his wife, 
Katie and his three children, Maddie, R.J. and 
Mathew. He is also survived by his mother, 3 
siblings, his beloved granddaughter Agnes 
and many nephews and nieces. 
Bob was a graduate of the University of 
Kansas and while in college worked at Mister 
Guys, a job that led him to a successful career 
in the clothing business. Bob and his wife 
Katie met while they were both working at the 
Ralph Lauren store in the Stanford Shopping 
Center. Bob said they were ‘‘struck by the en-
trepreneurial spirit’’ and in 1990 they founded 
Afterwards, a pioneering clothing consignment 
shop located in the heart of the Menlo Park 
business district. They later expanded into an 
adjacent property to sell home furnishings. 
Those who knew Bob describe him as 
warm, friendly, engaging and classy, a won-
derful man who always made time to chat. He 
had exceptional taste, a gentle smile, charm 
and was always ready with a quick witticism. 
He was the consummate businessman who al-
ways made his clients feel welcome and ap-
preciated. He was all of this and more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in expressing our 
deepest condolences to the entire Hanson 
family. It is my hope that these words and 
those of so many others will bring solace to 
them as they grieve the loss of this wonderful 
man.

DAN 
MALDONADO 
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGA´N 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, in every 
generation, there are people whose names 
may not make the paper every day, but whose 
actions and legacy make an immeasurable im-
pact felt by the entire community. Dan 
Maldonado is one of those people. In honoring 
him, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Insti-
tute is recognizing his lifelong dedication to 
public service and his trailblazing record, and 
ensuring that his contributions are remem-
bered for generations to come. 
If there’s one word that can describe Dan, 
‘‘vision’’ comes to mind. He was one of the 
first—if not the first—Latino Chiefs of Staff in 
the U.S. House of Representatives. He also 
helped create the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus (CHC) and the National Association of 
Latino Elected Officials (NALEO). These 
groups have grown from their humble roots to 
become leaders in amplifying the organized 
voices of Latino public officials and cementing 
the Latino community’s place in the public 
sphere. In large part, we have Dan to thank 
for that. 
Dan’s service didn’t end with Capitol Hill. He 
also worked in the Carter Administration as 
the Director of Legislation for ACTION/Peace 
Corps, helping to promote America’s image 
abroad and cultivate our country’s next gen-
eration of leaders. 
There is one story in particular that high-
lights the kind of person Dan is. In 1982, he 
served as the Chief of Staff for Latino Con-
gressman Edward Roybal from Los Angeles.

December 1, 2021 
That term, the AIDS epidemic began taking 
hold in Southern California. While many were 
fearful and even dismissive, Congressman 
ROYBAL knew that a public health response 
was required. Working with Dan, he offered an 
amendment to procure Congressional funding 
for AIDS research at the National Institute of 
Health. Through controversy and criticism, 
Dan stood behind Congressman ROYBAL’s 
amendment, which passed and proved critical 
to addressing the disease. 
Proposing and standing behind the amend-
ment was neither the obvious nor the popular 
thing to do. It was just the right thing to do, 
and Dan did it. That’s the kind of person and 
leader he is. Our country is a better place be-
cause of his contributions. 
I Congratulate Dan on this wonderful and 
well-deserved honor.

COMMEMORATING NOVEMBER 29TH 
AS THE ANNUAL OBSERVANCE 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALES-
TINIAN PEOPLE AS DESIGNATED 
BY THE UNITED NATIONS 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, the 
United Nations General Assembly has des-
ignated the 29th of November for the annual 
observance of the International Day of Soli-
darity with the Palestinian People. It was on 
November 29, 1947 that the Assembly adopt-
ed the resolution on the partition of Palestine. 
On November 29, 2021, in recognition of 
the Palestinian people and this annual observ-
ance I issued the following statement that I in-
clude in the RECORD: 
Today, the world reflects on the condition 
of the Palestinian people who struggle under 
a brutal military occupation, barely survive 
under a cruel blockade, exist as second-class 
citizens inside Israel, and live-in exile far 
from 
their 
homeland. 
The 
fundamental 
human rights all people seek, the rights that 
ensure safety and security, elevate human 
dignity, and promote peace and opportunity 
for the future, have been systematically de-
nied to the Palestinian people for nearly 
eight decades. The international community 
has a moral obligation, and I personally feel 
this obligation, to stand in solidarity with 
the people of Palestine—defending their 
human rights, promoting their right to self- 
determination, and working tirelessly for a 
path forward toward justice, equality, and 
freedom for all Palestinians. 
And, standing in solidarity with the Pales-
tinian people, I call on the State of Israel to 
end its military occupation, end its illegal 
settlement expansion and annexation of Pal-
estinian lands, and end its blockade of Gaza. 
I also call on the international community, 
including the U.S. government, to end poli-
cies that maintain the status quo, allowing 
for passive acquiescence to Israel’s system-
atical designed and executed actions to deny 
the Palestinian people a future in their own 
homeland. It is time for the world commu-
nity, especially the Biden administration, to 
take demonstrable steps toward holding all 
state and non-state actors in this conflict ac-
countable 
to 
internationally 
recognized 
standards while working for a diplomatic 
outcome that will achieve peace, security, 
and a future of hope and opportunity for Pal-
estinians, Israelis, and all people in the re-
gion. 
I am proud to stand in solidarity with the 
mothers and fathers, the elders, and the chil-
dren of Palestine. And, pledge to continue to 
work in partnership with the Palestinian 
people to build a future of hope and oppor-
tunity for today and tomorrow.

CELEBRATING 
TULARE 
HIGH 
SCHOOL’S FFA NATIONAL CHAM-
PIONSHIP 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Tulare High School’s Agricul-
tural Issues team for winning the prestigious 
2021 National FFA Agricultural Issues Forum 
Leadership Development Event in Indianap-
olis, Indiana. 
Hosted by the National FFA Organization, 
the National FFA Agricultural Issues Forum 
Leadership Development Event is a competi-
tive event that tests students’ knowledge of 
agricultural issues and evaluates how well 
they can apply classroom knowledge to real- 
life situations. To compete in the national com-
petition, teams must first design a presentation 
that addresses multiple viewpoints of a con-
temporary agricultural issue and present it to 
multiple audiences in their community. Teams 
must then incorporate the feedback received 
from their local community into their presen-
tation to the judges at the Leadership Devel-
opment Event. 
Raised in California’s San Joaquin Valley— 
the most productive and abundant agriculture 
region in the world—Tulare High School’s Ag-
ricultural Issues team was uniquely placed to 
learn from the world’s preeminent farmers in 
preparation for the Leadership Development 
Event, including the Tulare County Farm Bu-
reau, the Board of Directors at Harris Ranch, 
and other local community service clubs. Their 
national championship victory is a reflection of 
the determined work ethic and love for farming 
that defines Tulare County and the greater 
San Joaquin Valley community. 
Congratulations to team members Aidan 
Champagne, 
Duncan 
Champagne, 
Avery 
Coelho, Emma Coelho, and Madeline Lew, 
and their coaches, Jennifer Sousa, and Dave 
and Krim Caetano. The Central Valley is 
proud of their tremendous accomplishment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BRUCE 
CORWIN 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of my dear friend, 
Bruce Corwin, who passed away on Novem-
ber 4, 2021. 
Bruce was born on June 11, 1940, along-
side his twin sister Bonnie. He grew up in 
Southern California, where he attended Los 
Angeles High School, and then went on to at-
tend Wesleyan University in Middletown, Con-
necticut. 
Bruce returned home to become the third 
generation in his family to operate Metropoli-
tan Theatres Corporation, a company founded 
by Bruce’s grandfather in 1923 which operates 
a variety of multiplexes, theatres, and historic 
properties across Southern California. Most of 
their locations are in Santa Barbara and Los 
Angeles, with another location opening right 
along the coast in San Clemente in my con-
gressional district later this year. In recent 
years, Metropolitan Theatres has even ex-
panded to Colorado, Idaho, and Utah. 
Beyond his role as a motion picture exhibi-
tionist, Bruce was notably a valuable member 
of the community. He was famous around 
town for his license plate that spelled ‘‘P–E– 
O–P–L–E,’’ which perfectly explained his dedi-
cation to public service. 
Bruce previously served as Treasurer under 
former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley dur-
ing Bradley’s entire 30-year political career. 
He continued to serve the community on mul-
tiple boards and with numerous organizations 
such as the Martin Luther King, Jr. Community 
Health Foundation and Coro Southern Cali-
fornia. 
Bruce and his wife, Toni, were married for 
54 years and together they have two sons, 
David and Danny, and five grandchildren. 
Bruce Corwin lived an incredible and full life. 
He was a dedicated husband, parent, philan-
thropist, and friend—but most importantly an 
essential part of the community. I had the 
pleasure of knowing Bruce not only as a 
friend, but also as a mentor for over twenty 
years. We are grateful for his dedication and 
contributions to the entire Southern California 
community.

DIANA HERRERO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Diana Herrero, Deputy Di-
rector of the Division of Disease Control and 
Public Health Response at the Colorado De-
partment of Public Health and Environment 
(CDPHE) for her dedication and service to the 
people of the State of Colorado. Throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Diana went above 
and beyond to engage, educate and inform 
the community about COVID–19, including by 
participating in many Telephone Town Halls 
with my office and thousands of my constitu-
ents. 
Diana has served the constituents of Colo-
rado as a public health professional for more 
than 18 years in legislative and regulatory pol-
icy, immunization and emergency prepared-
ness program management, strategic plan-
ning, and performance management. In addi-
tion to her leadership role at CDPHE, Diana 
made it a priority to provide timely updates on 
COVID–19 and answer constituent’s questions 
regarding how to protect themselves and their 
families during an uncertain time. Her insights 
and knowledge were invaluable to my office 
and my constituents. 
It is because of local heroes like Diana that 
our state has been able to protect residents 
and keep our community safe. I thank Diana 
Herrero for her service and her sacrifice dur-
ing this difficult time, and look forward to con-
tinuing to work with her as we continue the 
fight against COVID–19 and its variants.

AMERICAN CYBERSECURITY 
LITERACY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 4055, the ‘‘American Cyberse-
curity Literacy Act,’’ bipartisan legislation I co- 
led to educate the American public about 
basic cybersecurity issues. 
Cyberattacks and data breaches are in-
creasingly common, costing private companies 
and consumers billions of dollars and expos-
ing the private information of countless Ameri-
cans. As attackers become more sophisti-
cated, Americans must have the tools to iden-
tify risks and protect themselves from attacks. 
This bipartisan legislation requires the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA), an agency within the 
Department of Commerce, to conduct a public 
education campaign to improve cyber literacy 
of the American populace by providing infor-
mation about common cybersecurity risks and 
best practices that can mitigate those risks. 
During the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee markup of the legislation, I offered an 
amendment to make several technical and 
minor edits to the legislation to ensure the lan-
guage is as effective as possible. One of 
those changes ensures that the cyber literacy 
campaign required by the bill also encourages 
Americans to install cybersecurity patches as-
sociated with software and apps they use. In-
stalling patches is one of the most effective 
tools consumers can use to protect them-
selves. When companies offer updates to their 
software and apps, they often include code 
that 
‘‘patches’’ 
recently 
identified 
vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks are often con-
ducted by exploiting known vulnerabilities and 
consumers can avoid their systems being ex-
ploited by installing patches as soon as they’re 
available. 
I thank Rep. KINZINGER, Chairman PALLONE, 
and Ranking Member MCMORRIS RODGERS for 
their partnership on this legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote for it.
