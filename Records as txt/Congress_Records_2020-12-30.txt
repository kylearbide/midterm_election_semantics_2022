The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, our gracious King, 
You are the one clear power of love in 
the midst of lesser powers. Thank You 
for giving us the confidence that You 
hear and answer prayers. 
Lord, use the Members of this body

world. Inspire them to discover Your 
love in each other and to see Your 
image in all creation. 
Lord, settle our Senators down into a

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, the Senate was supposed to fin-
ish legislation securing critical tools, 
training, and support for America’s 
Armed Forces, but the junior Senator 
from Vermont had other ideas. 
Remember, Senator SANDERS spent 
last summer, literally, trying to defund 
our military. Not my words, but the 
title of a piece he published: ‘‘Defund 
the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.’’ Our 
colleague offered an amendment to 
strip 10 percent of funding from our 
servicemembers and decimate our de-
fense budget. The Russians aren’t cut-
ting military funding. China isn’t cut-
ting funding. But last summer, Senator 
SANDERS and fellow Democrats, includ-
ing the Democratic leader, voted to 
make America unilaterally disarm and 
cut ours. 
The left took a break from trying to 
defund the police to try to defund our 
Armed Forces. Their amendment went 
down in a landslide, but now our col-
league from Vermont is again putting 
political stunts before the needs of our 
men and women in uniform. 
Our colleague says he will slow down 
this vital bill unless he gets to muscle 
through another stand-alone proposal 
from Speaker PELOSI that would add 
roughly half a trillion dollars to the 
national debt, which does not align 
with what President Trump has sug-
gested and which has no realistic path 
to quickly pass the Senate. 
Well, as I have said, the Senate will 
not let our national security be shoved 
off course, certainly not by Senators 
who have spent years—literally years— 
trying to gut America’s capabilities 
while our adversaries continue ramping 
up. The Senate will stay on this impor-
tant bill until we complete it one way 
or another. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now let’s talk 
about COVID–19 relief. Four days ago, 
President Trump signed the second 
largest rescue package in American 
history. The largest one was the 
CARES Act back in March. Due to this 
pandemic and our massive response, we 
now have a national debt far larger 
than our entire economy for the first 
time since World War II, but we knew 
our people needed more help, so Con-
gress just passed another nearly $900 
billion in emergency relief targeted to 
those who need it most, a second round 
of payroll support to save small busi-
ness jobs, more unemployment aid, 
vaccine distribution money, funding 
for safe schools, and much more. 
In addition to historic amounts of 
targeted help at the request of Presi-
dent Trump and his team, the package 
also included another round of direct 
checks to households, whether or not 
each household needs the help, whether 
or not their finances have changed dra-
matically this past year. 
Yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin an-
nounced households should begin re-
ceiving these payments as early as 
today and this week. That is more good 
news to a lot of people. 
After Congress and the administra-
tion finalized the bipartisan bill, the 
President expressed interest in further

S7972 
December 30, 2020 
expanding 
nontargeted 
direct 
pay-
ments. So to ensure the President was 
comfortable signing the bill into law, 
the Senate committed to beginning one 
process that would combine three of 
the President’s priorities: larger direct 
checks, a repeal of section 230 of the 
Communications Decency Act, and fur-
ther efforts to review the integrity of 
our democracy—three of the Presi-
dent’s priorities in one Senate process. 
That was the commitment, and that is 
what happened yesterday when I intro-
duced text reflecting just what the 
President had, in fact, requested. 
Now House and Senate Democrats 
want something very different. As they 
tried to do countless times in the past 
4 years, Speaker PELOSI and Leader 
SCHUMER are trying to pull a fast one 
on the President and the American 
people. 
First of all, they are hoping everyone 
just forgets about election integrity 
and Big Tech. They are desperate to ig-
nore those two parts of President 
Trump’s requests, and you can draw 
your own conclusions. Even on the 
question of larger checks, the Demo-
crats have tried to warp what Presi-
dent Trump actually laid out. 
Look, it is no secret that Repub-
licans have a diversity of views about 
the wisdom of borrowing hundreds of 
billions more to send out more nontar-
geted money, including to many house-
holds that have suffered no loss of in-
come during the crisis. COVID–19 has 
not affected all households equally— 
not even close. 
It is hardly clear that the Federal 
Government’s top priority should be 
sending thousands of dollars to, for ex-
ample, a childless couple making well 
into six figures who have been com-
fortably teleworking all year. Our duty 
is to help get help to the people who 
actually need help, like we did, to a 
historic degree, just 4 days ago. 
But above and beyond that discus-
sion, the Democratic leaders have bro-
ken from what President Trump pro-
posed. They quietly changed this pro-
posal in an attempt to let wealthy 
households suck up even more money. 
Speaker PELOSI structured her bill so 
that a family of four would have to 
earn more than $300,000 in order not— 
not to qualify for more cash. A family 
of three could pull in $250,000 per year— 
a quarter of a million dollars—and still 
qualify for some money. 
Democratic leaders want to call this 
scheme ‘‘survival checks.’’ Only my 
friends Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leader could look at households 
in New York and California who make 
$300,000, in households where nobody 
has been laid off, where earnings have 
not even dropped during the past year, 
and conclude these rich constituents of 
theirs need ‘‘survival checks’’ financed 
by 
taxpayer 
dollars 
and 
borrowed 
money 
Everyone sees the game here. These 
are the same Democrats who proudly 
blocked the entire aid package for 
months because they tried to hold out 
their special tax cuts for rich people in 
rich States. Now they say it is a mat-
ter of survival to send another boat-
load of cash to people making $300,000, 
regardless of whether they have experi-
enced any disruption at all this past 
year. 
Even the liberal Washington Post 
today is laughing at the political left 
for demanding more huge giveaways 
with no relationship to actual need. 
Here is what the Washington Post 
wrote: ‘‘Especially wrongheaded . . . is 
the progressive left, spearheaded by 
Sen. BERNIE SANDERS . . . who depicts 
the $2,000 as aid to ‘desperate’ Ameri-
cans despite the huge amounts destined 
for perfectly comfortable families.’’ 
That is from the editors of the Wash-
ington Post. 
The Wall Street Journal, usually 
their opposite number, actually agrees. 
These nontargeted ‘‘checks are unnec-
essary,’’ and struggling households can 
access targeted support like ‘‘expanded 
jobless benefits, food stamps, child- 
care subsidies and much more.’’ 
The liberal economist Larry Sum-
mers, 
President 
Clinton’s 
Treasury 
Secretary and President Obama’s NEC 
Director, says: ‘‘There is no good eco-
nomic argument’’ for universal $2,000 
checks at this moment. He points out 
the CARES Act and the brandnew law 
will 
already 
have 
boosted 
overall 
household income, relative to the econ-
omy, back to its prepandemic levels, if 
not higher. 
If specific struggling households need 
still more help after the huge, historic 
package that was just signed into law 4 
days ago has taken effect, then what 
they will need is smart, targeted aid, 
not 
another 
firehose 
of 
borrowed 
money that encompasses other people 
who are doing just fine. 
So, in my view, colleagues like Sen-
ator CORNYN and Senator TOOMEY have 
pointed this out persuasively. But, 
more broadly, here is the deal. The 
Senate is not going to split apart the 
three issues that President Trump 
linked together just because Demo-
crats are afraid to address two of them. 
The Senate is not going to be bullied 
into rushing out more borrowed money 
into the hands of the Democrats’ rich 
friends who don’t need the help. 
We just approved almost a trillion 
dollars in aid a few days ago. It struck 
a balance between broad support for all 
kinds of households and a lot more tar-
geted relief for those who need help the 
most. 
We are going to stay smart; we are 
going to stay focused; and we are going 
to continue delivering on the needs for 
our Nation.

ELECTORAL COLLEGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I was 
prepared this afternoon to speak about 
the business the Senate must address, 
and I will do that, but, first, I must re-
spond to the recent announcement by 
the junior Senator of Missouri that he 
intends to contest the certified votes of 
the electrical college when Congress 
meets to count those votes next week. 
The process for electing American 
Presidents is provided in our Constitu-
tion and laws. 
The process has been followed fully, 
fairly. The results have been duly cer-
tified by the Governors of the States, 
and they have been reviewed and con-
firmed by the courts many times over. 
The result is that Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS won the election by 
overwhelming margins in both the pop-
ular vote and the electoral vote. 
The 
Biden-Harris 
ticket 
received 
more than 81 million votes, more than 
any ticket in American history. That 
was over 7 million more votes than 
Trump-Pence. The Biden-Harris ticket 
won the electoral college 306 to 232, the 
very same total that President Trump 
called a landslide for himself then just 
4 years ago. 
Since the election process, President 
Trump and his acolytes have lost more 
than 50 lawsuits, falsely claiming fraud 
or other irregularities in the conduct 
of the 2020 election, including the 
unanimous decision by the Supreme 
Court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by 
the attorney general of Texas and more 
than half the Republican Members of 
the House. 
Today, we heard from the junior Sen-
ator from Missouri that he intends to 
object to the election results, particu-
larly in Pennsylvania—a State where

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7973 
December 30, 2020 
the Trump campaign and its allies have 
brought no fewer than 13 lawsuits and 
lost every single one, many with Re-
publican judges ruling. There have 
been only three individuals—three— 
charged with voter fraud in Pennsyl-
vania, and in each case, the person 
voted for Trump. 
The effort by the sitting President of 
the United States to overturn the re-
sults is patently undemocratic. The ef-
fort by others to amplify and burnish 
his ludicrous claims of fraud is equally 
revolting. This is America. We have 
elections. We have results. We make 
arguments based on fact and reason, 
not conspiracy and fantasy. 
On January 6, Congress will meet to 
formally recognize the electoral col-
lege result. There is a very clear proc-
ess to handle and dispense with the ob-
jections of Members of Congress to the 
counting of the result, and that is just 
what we will do—dispense with them. 
On January 6, Congress will ratify the 
electoral college’s decision that Joe 
Biden will be President and KAMALA 
HARRIS will be Vice President. Make no 
mistake 
about 
it—Joe 
Biden 
and 
KAMALA HARRIS will be sworn in as 
President and Vice President on Janu-
ary 20. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
let me return to the matters at hand. 
Today, the Senate will begin the 
process of overriding the President’s 
veto on the annual Defense bill. The 
House has already overridden the veto 
by a comfortable margin. I expect the 
Senate to follow suit and enact the 
NDAA into law over President Trump’s 
evolving 
and 
ridiculous 
objections. 
Congress has passed the annual Defense 
bill for 59 years in a row. It is an im-
portant opportunity to ensure our de-
fense and security policies reflect the 
evolving challenges of our world and 
provide our servicemembers and their 
families, as well as Defense Depart-
ment civilians, the support, resources, 
and training they need. The particular 
legislation includes a pay raise for 
troops and provisions that will allow 
the executive branch to be better pos-
tured to identify and deter breaches to 
America’s cyber security. In the wake 
of the SolarWinds hack, that might be 
a good policy to enact. 
Nonetheless, President Trump vetoed 
this legislation because it provides for 
renaming military installations that 
honor Confederate military leaders or, 
maybe, because it doesn’t address an 
unrelated social media issue. Think 
about it for a moment. The President 
vetoed a pay raise to living American 
soldiers in order to defend the honor of 
dead Confederate traitors. Well, the 
Senate will soon have an opportunity 
to override the President’s objection 
and do right by those brave Americans 
who wear the uniform. 
As I said yesterday, there are two 
major issues before the Senate right 
now—the annual Defense bill and the 
vital and important effort to send 
$2,000 stimulus checks to American 
families. There are only a few days left 
in this session, and the Senate should 
consider both issues before adjourning. 
There is a very simple solution to 
this 
dilemma: 
Leader 
MCCONNELL 
should bring both measures up for a 
vote and let the chips fall where they 
may. I believe both measures—the de-
fense override and the $2,000 checks to 
American families—will pass, but at 
the very least, the Senate deserves the 
opportunity for an up-or-down vote on 
increasing the individual payments to 
the American people. 
At the end of my remarks, I will ask 
the Senate to set a time tonight for a 
vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 
checks. The Republican leader objected 
to a similar request I made yesterday, 
and it appears he may be considering a 
different bill that packages stimulus 
checks with other unrelated and par-
tisan policies. 
I want to be very clear about one 
thing: There is no other game in town 
besides the House bill. The only way to 
get the American people the $2,000 
checks they deserve and need is to pass 
the House bill and pass it now. The 
House has recessed for the year. Any 
modification or addition to the House 
bill cannot become law before the end 
of this Congress. It is a way to kill the 
bill. Make no mistake about it: Either 
the Senate takes up and passes the 
House bill or struggling American fam-
ilies will not get $2,000 checks during 
the worst economic crisis in 75 years. 
Over the past few days, the idea of in-
creasing direct payments to the Amer-
ican people has united folks from all 
points of the political spectrum. I sa-
lute the Senator from Vermont for the 
good job he has done in bringing this 
forward to the American people’s at-
tention. An overwhelming bipartisan 
majority in the House supports the 
$2,000 
checks. 
Senate 
Democrats 
strongly support these $2,000 checks, 
and 
our 
unlikely 
ally, 
President 
Trump, this morning, tweeted: ‘‘$2000 
ASAP!’’ For once, the Democrats agree 
with something on President Trump’s 
Twitter feed. Let’s send $2,000 ASAP to 
working Americans who are facing the 
hardest and darkest days of the pan-
demic. 
After all of the insanity that the 
Senate 
Republicans 
have 
tolerated 
from President Trump—his attacks on 
the rule of law, an independent judici-
ary, the conduct that led to his im-
peachment—is this where the Senate 
Republicans are going to draw the 
line—with $2,000 checks to the Amer-
ican people? That is a bridge too far? 
Please. 
For the awareness of my colleagues, 
we can have this vote tonight and send 
the bill directly to the President’s desk 
for his signature. We can vote on the 
NDAA bill tonight and finish the Sen-
ate’s business before the end of the 
year. All it takes is our Republican col-
leagues to consent to a simple vote on 
the House bill to provide $2,000 checks 
to the American people. Yes or no, up 
or down, do you support sending $2,000 
to the American people or not? Let’s 
have the vote. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 9051 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 9051, a bill received 
from the House, to increase recovery 
rebate amounts to $2,000 for individ-
uals; that the bill be read a third time 
and passed; and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
object.

tion is heard.

Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS— 
H.R. 9051 AND H.R. 6395 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want 
to concur with what Senator SCHUMER 
said. What he said goes beyond eco-
nomics. It goes beyond the desperation 
that tens of millions of working fami-
lies are facing. It goes beyond the 
struggles of the people of Vermont or 
Kentucky. 
Let me just make it clear for the ma-
jority leader that 10 out of the poorest 
25 counties in the United States of 
America are located in Kentucky. So 
my 
colleague 
the 
majority 
leader 
might want to get on the phone and 
start talking to working families in 
Kentucky and find out how they feel 
about the need for immediate help in 
terms of a $2,000 check per adult. I have 
the strong feeling that the people of 
Kentucky will respond no differently 
than the people of Vermont or New 
York. The last poll that I saw had 78 
percent of the American people saying 
they wanted and needed that type of 
help. 
This discussion, frankly, is not just 
about the economic struggling of work-
ing families in this country. It is not 
just about the massive levels of income 
and wealth inequality. It is about basic 
democracy. 
Now, what we have to do here on the 
floor, whether it is Senator SCHUMER or 
Senator MCCONNELL or I, is to talk in 
legalese. That is the language of the 
U.S. Senate. The stuff sounds pretty 
complicated to the average person, but 
all that Senator SCHUMER and I are 
asking of the majority leader is very 
simple: Allow the Members of the U.S. 
Senate to cast a vote. If you want to

December 30, 2020 
vote against $2,000 checks for people in 
your State, vote against it. I see Sen-
ator TOOMEY here. He has been clear 
about it. I suspect he will vote against 
it. I respect his opinion, but all that we 
are asking for is a vote. What is the 
problem? In the House, over two-thirds 
of the Members of that body, including 
44 Republicans, voted to say, in this 
time of economic desperation, working 
families deserve help, and they deserve 
a $2,000 check. 
As Senator SCHUMER just indicated, 
we have a very unlikely ally in Presi-
dent Trump. Nobody here has disagreed 
with Trump more times than I have; 
yet here is what the leader of the Re-
publican Party writes: ‘‘$2000 ASAP!’’ 
So, even on this issue, amazingly 
enough, the President of the United 
States is right. 
What all of this comes down to, my 
fellow Americans, is not even whether 
you agree with Senator SCHUMER and 
myself and 78 percent of the American 
people or whether you agree with Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and, I suspect, Sen-
ator TOOMEY. That is fine. It is called 
democracy. We have differences of 
opinion. All that I am asking is to give 
us a vote. What is the problem? Allow 
the U.S. Senators to cast a vote as to 
whether they are for the $2,000 check or 
whether they are against it. 
We will need, as I understand it, 60 
votes to win. That is a big hurdle. I 
don’t know that we are going to win. 
There are a number of Republicans, to 
their credit, who have said they are 
ready to vote for it. I suspect there 
may be more, when given the oppor-
tunity, who will vote for it. Maybe I 
am wrong. Maybe we will lose. I think 
that would be unfortunate. All that I 
am asking for right now is to give us 
the opportunity to vote. What is the 
problem with that? 
I will now go to Senate legalese. 
I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 
a.m. on Thursday, December 31, the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 9051, a bill to provide 
a $2,000 direct payment to the working 
class; that the bill be considered read a 
third time; and that the Senate vote on 
the passage of the bill, without inter-
vening action or debate; further, that if 
passed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; further, that immediately fol-
lowing the vote on H.R. 9051, the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of the veto message on H.R. 6395 
and that the Senate immediately vote 
on the passage of the bill, the objec-
tions of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding, with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, let me start 
by pointing out that we are not in the 
same place that we were back in 
March. Our economy is in nothing like 
the situation we faced during a mo-
ment in March when this body came 
together and voted unanimously, I be-
lieve, for the most extraordinary aid 
package—financial stimulus bill, how-
ever you care to characterize it—in the 
history of the world by far. Remember 
where we were. We had closed down the 
economy. To a very large degree, the 
American economy had stopped func-
tioning because State governments 
around the country decided they had to 
close it down. We can discuss and we 
can argue about whether that was a 
good decision or not, but given the lim-
ited knowledge we had about the na-
ture of the COVID–19 threat, it was 
deemed to be the right thing to do. 
So we were on the verge of having no 
economy. That has never happened be-
fore in our history. 
So what did we do? We decided this 
calls for extraordinary measures, and 
we would try to use Federal dollars as 
a substitute for the economy—just re-
place lost income on a massive, unprec-
edented scale—and we did. We approved 
almost $3 trillion in that legislation. 
At the time, we included $1,200 per 
person. You could make an argument 
that that was an extremely inefficient 
use of that $1,200 per person, but at the 
time, given the circumstances, I under-
stood why we didn’t have many good 
options, and that was something we de-
cided to do. 
So where are we now? We are in a 
very different place. Our economy is 
not in a free fall. Our economy is in a 
recovery mode. We are not back to 
where we want to end up. We are not 
back to where we were before March, 
but we have taken big steps in that di-
rection. 
The economy grew at 33 percent last 
quarter—33 percent. That is a tremen-
dous recovery that is underway. More 
than half of all the people who lost 
their jobs earlier this year have re-
gained their jobs. So we are not fin-
ished yet, but that is a huge step along 
the way. 
And now we are being told, after 
passing another extraordinary bill— 
this one almost $1 trillion and includ-
ing $600 per person—that that is not 
enough; we need to do $2,000 per person, 
despite the fact that we know for sure, 
we know for a fact, that the large ma-
jority of those checks are going to go 
to people who had no lost income. 
How does that make any sense at all? 
We know for sure that the majority of 
these people had no lost income. They 
didn’t lose their jobs, and yet we are 
going to send them not $600, not the 
$1,200, but $2,000. 
So think about this. A married cou-
ple, who both are working and have 2 
kids, maybe they work for the Federal 
Government, like 2 million-odd people 
do. Maybe they work for a large com-
pany, the vast majority of which did 
not have large numbers of layoffs. So 
this two-child, two-income couple that 
makes six figures had no interruption, 
no diminishment of their income what-
soever. They are going to get $8,000 of 
money we don’t have that is going to 
be either borrowed or printed. That is 
what it is all going to come down to. 
There are people who are still suf-
fering from the economic fallout of 
this terrible COVID crisis. There is no 
question about it. We know there are 
people who are concentrated in a hand-
ful of industries, for the most part—not 
exclusively—but 
people 
who 
have 
worked in the restaurant industry, peo-
ple who work for hotels, travel, enter-
tainment. So many of those people are 
still out of work and their prospects of 
getting their old jobs back are not good 
in the short run. I sure hope they will 
be good in the medium-term run, if not 
sooner. 
And our bill addressed that. It ad-
dressed that problem. How did we do 
that? With a new round of PPP loans, 
which are really grants to small busi-
nesses, if they will keep their work-
force intact; expansion of unemploy-
ment insurance benefits, so that people 
who have historically been ineligible 
remain eligible so they can continue to 
collect unemployment benefits; an in-
crease in the amount of unemployment 
benefits, a $300-a-week overlay of Fed-
eral money on top of whatever their 
State program is; $600 per person, re-
gardless of whether they lost income. 
All of that was passed just a few days 
ago, and now we are told we need to 
come back immediately, right now, 
and make sure that we are sending 
$2,000 checks to people who had no lost 
income. 
So for that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 9051 AND H.R. 6395 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to echo the sentiments of the Senator 
from Vermont. He is right. The Repub-
licans are wrong on this issue. On 
every single part of this debate, Sen-
ator SANDERS is right; the Republicans 
are wrong. 
We are in the middle of an unprece-
dented crisis in our country. We have a 
healthcare crisis, we have an unem-
ployment crisis, we have a hunger cri-
sis, we have a housing crisis, we have 
an addiction crisis, and we have a 
moral crisis in this country. 
The U.S. Government should be re-
sponding to the needs, to the despera-
tion of families in our country at this 
time. There is a crisis of faith that the 
American people have in its govern-
ment’s ability to respond to human 
suffering. Well, this institution has 
been created to respond to human suf-
fering. That is our job. 
Tony Fauci has made it very clear 
that the worst of the pandemic is 
ahead of us, not behind us. We know 
what is coming, and yet we are not re-
sponding. We know this is not going 
away soon, and yet we are not respond-
ing. 
A program, Operation Warp Speed, 
was created to create a vaccine, but be-
cause for 7 months the Republicans 
have refused to fund the public health

December 30, 2020 
system of our country at the State and 
local level, we have ‘‘Operation Snail 
Speed’’ to put the vaccinations in the 
arms of the American people. 
It was anticipatable. Tony Fauci and 
others were warning us back in May 
and June and July that there would be 
a second wave and the second wave 
could be bigger. We got the warning. 
The Republicans refused to heed that 
warning. 
And here we are now, without the 
public health infrastructure to deal 
with the overflow capacity in emer-
gency rooms, in ICUs all across the 
country, while simultaneously asking 
those same medical institutions to put 
vaccinations in the arms of healthy 
people, without the resources provided 
by the Federal Government to help 
those States and local communities to 
deal with that crisis. 
Sometimes Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
would say that when you deal with an 
issue you deal with it with benign ne-
glect if you don’t want to help or you 
don’t want to hurt—deal with benign 
neglect. 
What has happened with the Repub-
licans this year is that they created a 
program which is designed neglect. It 
is an actual plan not to provide the 
funding, not to provide the help for 
those families, for those communities, 
for those institutions that are now 
being overwhelmed, and asked, on top 
of that, to put this extra burden of put-
ting vaccinations in people’s arms, but 
without the extra resources. 
And what do they do on the Repub-
lican side? They throw out these red 
herrings—so many red herrings that 
you would need to build an aquarium 
in the well here of the Senate in order 
to deal with all of them—that gets 
away from the central issue: Yes or no, 
up or down, will you provide $2,000 to 
Americans who are going to need it 
through what Tony Fauci is saying will 
be the worst part of this pandemic? Yes 
or no, up or down, where do they stand 
on this issue? 
Here is what we do know. Repub-
licans seem more focused on funding 
the Defense Department than they do 
on funding the defenseless in our coun-
try, and Americans are becoming more 
defenseless as each day goes by. The 
headlines 
are 
screaming 
that 
this 
panic, which is absolutely understand-
able and based upon fact, is sweeping 
our country. 
There is protection that the Federal 
Government should be providing to 
these families. We hear it. They are 
hungry. They could be without their 
homes. The addiction crisis is rising. 
They need help in their families. 
So from my perspective, we have a 
moment in time, and Donald Trump 
happens to agree with us—even though 
a broken clock is right twice a day. 
And we do agree with him. He is right. 
We do need this help, which we should 
be providing to these families. 
As we watch more and more of our 
American loved ones fall sick and die, 
families are facing a new and unprece-
dented hardship. They are having to 
make impossible decisions as to wheth-
er to put food on the table or keep the 
heat 
on 
through 
the 
cold 
winter 
months, and the U.S. Government has 
an obligation to help working people 
who, through no fault of their own, are 
seeing all of the things that they care 
about, all of the success that they have 
worked for, and all the financial secu-
rity they have earned be washed away. 
And yet the Republicans want to put 
another ‘‘Operation Snail Speed’’ in 
place. 
The damage to these families is 
anticipatable. We can see what is un-
folding. Dr. Fauci is telling us that we 
are at the worst part of the pandemic 
and it is going to continue. So let us 
act in anticipation. 
Louis Pasteur used to say that 
‘‘chance favors the prepared mind.’’ 
That is what Dr. Tony Fauci is telling 
us. Let us prepare. Let us help families 
prepare for what is about to arrive. 
Just in Massachusetts alone, 21,000 
new people applied for unemployment 
insurance in the week before Christ-
mas. Food banks across Massachusetts 
and across the country are seeing dou-
ble-digit increases in demand with fam-
ilies who never faced food insecurity 
before. People are literally starving, 
cold, and without homes. 
Meanwhile, the majority leader and 
Republican leadership would rather 
head home for the New Year and ignore 
the financial and health crises that are 
taking a toll on our families. For mil-
lions of Americans, this will be a New 
Year holiday where they won’t know if 
they can put food on the table that 
night. Republicans are claiming that 
giving $2,000 in direct cash payments to 
working Americans would be too ex-
pensive, that it would inflate our na-
tional deficit, that our budgets are al-
ready bloated. 
I have to ask, though, where was this 
outrage when Republicans blew up our 
national deficit to give a $1.5 trillion 
tax cut to billionaires and corpora-
tions? These are the crocodile tears 
from the right, as Americans are shed-
ding real tears thinking about where 
their next meal will come from, the 
eviction notice on the front door, or 
losing healthcare in the midst of this 
crisis. 
Americans are actually tired of being 
told that $600 is ‘‘sufficient’’ as an 
amount of money as relief, as billion-
aires receive their tax breaks and grow 
their wealth by the trillions of dollars 
during this crisis. The rich get richer, 
and the rest are there left suffering. 
They have had enough of being told 
that there just isn’t the money for sup-
port for the well-being of their commu-
nities when they can see tax breaks 
going to those companies that are ac-
tually laying off workers. 
Americans are tired of being let down 
by their government time and time 
again, as Donald Trump and his Repub-
lican allies have abandoned them dur-
ing this response to the pandemic. 
Americans need support. They need 
to be able to trust their government, 
and they need $2,000 now. So that is the 
issue: Yes or no, up or down, on pro-
viding $2,000 to Americans to help them 
make it through the worst part of this 
crisis. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, De-
cember 31, the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of H.R. 9051, a 
bill to provide a $2,000 direct payment 
to the working class; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and the 
Senate vote on passage of that bill 
without intervening action or debate; 
further, that if passed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table; and that immediately 
following the vote on H.R. 9051, the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of the veto message on H.R. 
6395; that the Senate immediately vote 
on passage of the bill, the objections of 
the President to the contrary notwith-
standing, with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator for Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to 
object, Mr. President, Speaker PELOSI’s 
second bite at the apple, just after we 
voted on a $900 billion bill that has now 
been signed into law by the President 
of the United States, is not the way to 
send relief to the hardest hit Ameri-
cans. Under this legislation, a family of 
five with an annual income of $350,000 
would receive a stimulus check. This is 
reminiscent of the Heroes Act that the 
House passed, which cut taxes for mil-
lionaires and billionaires. This isn’t 
about helping the people that need it 
the most. This is about helping mil-
lionaires and billionaires and people 
who frankly have not suffered the 
hardships economically that others 
have during this pandemic. The median 
household in my State is $60,000, and 
the Speaker wants to send taxpayer- 
funded assistance to folks earning 
nearly six times that much. Even the 
Washington Post editorial board agrees 
this is bad policy. 
It doesn’t differentiate between peo-
ple who have been receiving a pay-
check during this pandemic, such as 
government 
employees, 
and 
people 
who, simply by virtue of their job, have 
been put out of work and are not re-
ceiving any income or maybe at best 
unemployment 
compensation. 
The 
Speaker’s bill isn’t about targeting 
folks who have lost their jobs or have 
seen their income reduced. It is a far 
cry from the additional assistance 
President Trump requested for the 
hardest hit Americans. The reality is, 
this bill would spend roughly $300 bil-
lion more on folks who aren’t even ex-
periencing a financial strain from the 
pandemic. 
We need to focus on the people who 
have been hurt. That is what our 
COVID–19 relief bill, which was just re-
cently signed into law, is designed to 
do, and I dare say this is not going to 
be the last time we visit this topic. If 
there is more we need to do, I am con-
fident we will do it. But today, in this

way, is not the right way to do it. I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully and watched three oc-
casions on the floor this afternoon 
where Senators SCHUMER, SANDERS, 
and MARKEY have tried to create an op-
portunity where the Senate would ac-
tually come together and vote, where 
the Senate might make a decision 
based on the merits of this issue, rath-
er than to keep talking around the 
issue. 
What is at stake is a substantial sum 
of money for families who are in the 
midst of the struggle of their lives— 
$2,000—characterized a few moments 
ago by my friend from Texas as 
‘‘Speaker PELOSI’s idea.’’ Well, I might 
remind him that it is also Donald 
Trump’s idea and still is. The President 
has told us this morning that we 
should move on this as quickly as pos-
sible, and although I don’t often come 
to the floor to agree with the Presi-
dent, he is right. In this instance he is 
clearly right. 
What are we doing now? We are call-
ing Senators back to Washington from 
the far reaches across the United 
States. This morning, I received some 
email and text messages from some of 
my colleagues hopping on airplanes at 
6 a.m. on the west coast to face a vote. 
What is this vote all about? Well, first, 
it is to override the veto of the Presi-
dent when it comes to the Defense au-
thorization bill. This was certainly 
something that was occasioned by one 
Senator, the junior Senator from Ken-
tucky, who forced us into a position 
where that vote needed to be taken 
here. It could have been handled much 
more efficiently and to the benefit of 
all Members if it was scheduled for the 
weekend when we were assuming a new 
session of Congress. But he insisted, 
and we are returning and, frankly, put-
ting in peril again, in the midst of a 
pandemic, Members of the Senate who 
are traveling from all the far reaches of 
this country to be part of this action in 
Washington. 
But it isn’t just the junior Senator 
from Kentucky who is having us sit 
here in Washington and wait for things 
that could be taken care of with dis-
patch. It is the senior Senator from 
Kentucky as well. He has decided that 
we will not get a vote on the House 
measure to increase the payments to 
$2,000. Make no mistake, there is only 
one way to bring this relief to the fam-
ilies of America. It is to pass the bill 
already enacted by the House of Rep-
resentatives—a bill which received 44 
Republican votes in addition to a sub-
stantial number of Democrats, with 
only 2 voting no. Forty-four Repub-
lican votes joined with the Democrats 
to call for this measure which many 
have been decrying on the floor here as 
a class struggle or whatever their argu-
ment might be. There is no other meas-
ure, including Senator MCCONNELL’s al-
ternative, which has any ghost of a 
chance to help the families in this 
country with this $2,000 benefit. The 
only thing that will do it—the only one 
thing that will do it—is this bill that 
has already passed the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
The House has recessed. When they 
are going to return is uncertain. They 
certainly don’t have the time to work 
through the regular order of business 
to consider any new legislation even if 
we could send it in time, which I be-
lieve is very doubtful. So it is up to 
Senator MCCONNELL
to decide right 
here and now, are we going to come to-
gether as a Senate this afternoon at 5 
o’clock, when we are supposed to be 
back and voting, and get this matter 
done? 
Bring it to the Senate for a vote. 
Let’s have this vote up or down, and let 
the Democrats and Republicans express 
their will on behalf of the families in 
this country. 
I couldn’t agree more with the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts and his char-
acterization 
of 
what 
families 
face 
across this country and, certainly, in 
my home State of Illinois. 
I just wonder if any of the Repub-
lican Senators who are downplaying 
this economic crisis facing these fami-
lies have really looked into the issue. 
This morning, in the Senator’s home 
State of Texas, they showed an early 
morning television show and the cars 
that were lining up for food banks— 
long lines of people waiting for food 
banks. They interviewed some of them 
in Texas who told heartbreaking sto-
ries of how they once were volunteers 
at this same food bank and are now de-
pendent for a helping hand if they were 
going to be able to feed their families. 
These are people who are not lazy at 
all. Misfortune has come their way, 
and the question is, Will we help? This 
is our opportunity—today. It is a meas-
ure that has passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, not some theory of some 
legislation that might be considered 
tomorrow—today. Let’s have this vote 
today, this evening. When the Senators 
have returned, let’s determine whether 
or not this House-passed measure of 
$2,000 is going to be enacted into law, 
since the President is clearly anxious 
to sign it. 
That to me is the reasonable thing to 
do. In fact, it might even sound like 
the U.S. Senate is taking a vote on a 
timely issue after a debate. We do it so 
seldom around here that I think we 
have lost our muscle memory when it 
comes to this activity in the Senate. It 
is time to return to it. 
I thank the Senator from Vermont, 
the Senator from Massachusetts, and, 
of course, the Democratic leader for 
bringing this issue before us this after-
noon. But it shouldn’t end with our 
great speeches. It ought to end with an 
important vote for the people of this 
country. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would 
the Senator from Illinois yield for a 
question? 
Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I won-
der if the Senator from Illinois would 
consider pairing their request for a 
$2,000 direct payment with a liability 
shield provision that would guard busi-
nesses that have been operating in 
good faith and following the guidelines 
put out by public health and govern-
ment institutions, and preserve a right 
to sue for reckless and willful disregard 
of the rights for others? Would the Sen-
ator consider pairing those two to-
gether? 
Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response 
to my colleague, I know his passionate 
defense of the notion for immunity 
from 
liability 
for 
corporations 
in 
America. He has introduced a lengthy 
bill on the subject. I don’t believe that 
is consistent with keeping this Nation 
safe during a pandemic, and it cer-
tainly is not responsive to any on-
slaught of lawsuits. 
The Senator might be interested to 
know that the number of medical mal-
practice cases filed in the name of 
COVID–19 since the onset of this cur-
rent pandemic is slightly higher than 
the total number of lawsuits filed by 
Donald Trump in protesting the results 
of the November 3 election. This is not 
a tsunami of lawsuits. 
I believe we can take reasonable 
measures to support and defend those 
corporations and companies that are 
making a good-faith effort to comply 
with public health standards and pro-
tect their employees and customers. 
His bill, I am afraid, goes way too far. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
concur with my friend from Illinois on 
the issue. 
I have a question for my colleague 
from Texas. It is a very simple ques-
tion. You have concerns about the 
issue of corporate liability. I get that. 
I happen not to agree with you. You 
are entitled to your opinion. You may 
or may not be concerned about section 
230 of the 1996 Federal telecommuni-
cations bill. That is fine too. We might 
have a discussion about how we protect 
American democracy. It is a good dis-
cussion as well. But I have a strong 
feeling, Senator CORNYN, that in Texas, 
as in Vermont—you know what—people 
are not really talking about corporate 
liability. It is a good issue. It is an im-
portant issue. I don’t believe they are 
talking about section 230. What I think 
they are talking about, as the Senator 
from Illinois just said, is how they are 
going to feed their kids today. That is 
the issue. And what I would ask my 
friend from Texas is, What is your 
problem with allowing the Senate to 
vote on whether or not we are going to 
allow Americans, working-class people 
to get a $2,000 check? 
Now I gather that when that vote 
comes to the floor—and I hope it comes

immediately—you will vote no, and 
you will explain to the people of Texas 
why you voted that way. That is called 
democracy. I respect that. But what is 
your problem with allowing the Senate 
to have a free standing vote? 
There are a number of people on your 
side, Republicans, who have already 
come forward and said yes, they want 
to vote for this $2,000 check. 
Now, if you want to deal with cor-
porate liability, that is fine. Let’s deal 
with it at some point. Bring forward a 
bill, and we can vote on it up or down. 
All that we are asking for is a simple, 
up-or-down vote on the issue that tens 
of millions of people are talking about 
right now: Will they survive economi-
cally in the midst of this terrible pan-
demic? 
I ask my colleague from Texas: What 
is the problem with allowing the U.S. 
Senate to vote on the bill passed by the 
House? 
I yield to my colleague from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would 
say to our colleague from Vermont, I 
have no problem with providing assist-
ance, whether it is to public health of-
ficials who are trying to struggle with 
this pandemic or to provide money for 
research for the therapeutics or vac-
cines which, fortunately, are now being 
distributed around the country. I have 
no objection to direct payments to in-
dividuals. I voted for the $1,200 direct 
payments contained in the CARES Act. 
I voted for the additional money that 
is provided for in the most recent 
COVID–19 legislation. But this legisla-
tion that the Senator from Vermont is 
advocating would benefit households 
with annual incomes of over $350,000. 
They would get this money. 
I would say that one way to deal with 
this—because, of course, we negotiated 
back and forth on the last COVID–19 
bill, and nobody got everything they 
wanted—but if our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle want an addi-
tional financial benefit for people mak-
ing up to $350,000, why not couple it 
with liability protection for people who 
are acting in good faith? 
This isn’t just about corporations, 
and our colleagues across the aisle 
know it. This is about schools. This is 
about 
churches, 
synagogues, 
and 
mosques. This is about every business 
that 
is 
worried 
that 
a 
game 
of 
‘‘gotcha’’ is going to take place and 
they are going to end up paying the 
price. Even if they win the lawsuit, 
they will still have to pay for the cost 
of defense, potentially losing their 
businesses outright. 
Clearly, our colleagues across the 
aisle care more about trial lawyers and 
being able to bring litigation against 
businesses that have tried to do their 
best and have struggled with the evolv-
ing public health guidance provided by 
the CDC and other authorities. Clearly, 
if they are not interested in engaging 
in a negotiation where people, who 
through no fault of their own, find 
themselves victimized by frivolous liti-
gation, then, we have no alternative 
but to continue to object to this re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if you 
listened carefully, you understood that 
my friend from Texas did not answer 
my question. He has a concern about 
corporate liability. It is a legitimate 
debate. Do you know what? Bring it to 
the floor. Let’s vote it up or down. I 
will vote against it. You will vote for 
it. But I asked you a very simple ques-
tion, not about linking things to-
gether—nobody in the real world un-
derstands that stuff. That is inside-the- 
beltway stuff. 
What people in the real world know— 
and I want to take a moment to read 
some of these statements. We have a 
lot of people on our social media, and 
we asked the American people, just the 
other day: Tell me; what would a $2,000 
check mean to you? What is going on 
in your life? 
And in just over 24 hours, I would say 
to my friend from Texas, nearly 6,000 
people responded. Here is just what a 
few of them had to say. This is Twitter 
stuff. So I don’t have their names here, 
and I wouldn’t use them publicly, any-
how. But this is what they say. 
One person writes: ‘‘$2,000 is the dif-
ference between keeping our apartment 
and being evicted.’’ Here is another 
one: ‘‘$2,000 means I can afford to feed 
my three kids.’’ Another response: ‘‘It 
would mean not having to choose be-
tween rent and groceries and not hav-
ing to ration my partner’s meds.’’ An-
other response: ‘‘I am raising my 
grandson with medical needs. I am 
$4,000 behind on utilities. We need elec-
tricity to run his medical equipment.’’ 
Here is another response: ‘‘$2,000 would 
mean I wouldn’t have to worry about 
making my mortgage payment this 
month, and I could get my medica-
tion.’’ Another response: ‘‘$2,000 would 
mean paying my rent and getting life-
saving treatment because I can’t afford 
the $50 copay through my work insur-
ance just to see my neurologist right 
now’’—and on and on and on. Thou-
sands of people responded. 
So, I want to get back to the point. I 
want to again say to my friend from 
Texas: If you have a concern about cor-
porate liability—good issue—bring it to 
the floor. Let’s vote on corporate li-
ability. 
I would yield for a question from my 
friend from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 
for a question through the Chair. 
I have listened to the figures used on 
the floor about families who would 
qualify for the $2,000. It is my under-
standing that an individual with an in-
come of $75,000 or less could qualify for 
the $2,000 payment, and for a joint re-
turn—husband and wife—$2,000 could be 
given to them if their income is under 
$150,000. Is that your understanding? 
Mr. SANDERS. That is my under-
standing. And I think, you know, as 
Republicans do, they are going to let it 
be. 
But I get back to my friend—my 
friend from Texas, Senator CORNYN. We 
are asking a simple question. If you 
want to bring up corporate liability, 
bring it up. If you want to bring up sec-
tion 230, bring it up. If you want to 
bring up the man in the Moon, bring it 
up. But what the American people 
want now is an up-or-down vote. 
Look, you are going to vote against 
it if it comes to the floor. That is fine. 
It is your right. Explain it to the peo-
ple of Texas. I will vote for it. But all 
that I am asking for is the right, as a 
U.S. Senator, to have the vote. 
Again I ask you: What is your prob-
lem with Members of the U.S. Senate, 
including a number of Republicans, 
who have already indicated they would 
like to vote for this? What is your 
problem with bringing that up as a sin-
gle stand-alone bill, not merged with 
corporate liability or anything else? 
What is your problem with that? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would 
say to our colleague from Vermont: 
This money is not targeted to people 
who have suffered financially. 
Mr. SANDERS. Then vote against it. 
Mr. CORNYN. It is not targeted to 
people who have suffered financial 
losses. This money would go to mem-
bers of your own staff if they meet the 
financial requirements and to other 
government employees who have suf-
fered no financial loss during this pan-
demic. 
We have all suffered in different ways 
during the pandemic, to be sure, but, 
financially, this money is designed to 
help the people who need it the most. 
Why would you send money to govern-
ment employees who have been receiv-
ing their full paycheck during this pan-
demic? 
Mr. SANDERS. That is a good ques-
tion. And then I will have to explain 
that to the people of the State of 
Vermont. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas has the floor. 
Mr. SANDERS. He asked me a ques-
tion, as I understood it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. SANDERS. Did the Senator from 
Texas ask me a question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. It was more of a rhe-
torical question. 
Mr. SANDERS. I took you literally. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come to the floor and talk about 
what strikes me as something akin to 
Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is 
only the day I was born. It is some-
thing I feel like we are living through 
here as we debate the same points over

December 30, 2020 
and over and over again, forgetting 
what it is we have already done—the 
good things we have done together on a 
bipartisan basis. 
We have already appropriated rough-
ly $4 trillion in response to this pan-
demic, and it is appropriate that we 
have done so because this was a true 
public health crisis. But now this is— 
we are seeing politics creep back in in 
an attempt to send money in an 
untargeted and wasteful sort of way to 
people who have suffered no financial 
loss. 
These relief packages that we passed 
together have provided hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars to support our hospitals 
and healthcare workers who are on the 
frontlines. I voted for it, and I think we 
were right to do so. 
We have thrown small businesses and 
their employees a lifeline through the 
Paycheck Protection Program, and we 
were right to do so. We have invested 
in research, development, and manu-
facturing of therapeutics and vaccines 
that 
are 
currently 
being 
adminis-
tered—thank 
goodness—throughout 
the country and, indeed, around the 
world. And we have sent unprecedented 
assistance to workers, families, and in-
dividuals whose livelihoods have been 
upended by this crisis. 
Thanks to President Trump’s leader-
ship, Congress has stepped up and met 
this unprecedented challenge to deliver 
relief bill after relief bill for the Amer-
ican people. If you had told me a year 
ago I would have voted this year alone 
for roughly $4 trillion worth of spend-
ing in this pandemic, I would not have 
believed you. But I do believe this is a 
domestic equivalent to World War II, 
where we have to do everything hu-
manly possible to try to help our fellow 
man, woman, and child during this 
pandemic. 
The latest round of relief came, of 
course, just this week, when President 
Trump signed the $900 billion rescue 
package into law. While I am glad Con-
gress was able to send more relief out 
the door at the end of the year, I am 
disappointed that it took so long to do 
so. It is amazing the sense of urgency 
our Democratic colleagues have today, 
since at least three times—maybe four 
times—they blocked our attempts to 
pass half-trillion-dollar relief bills dur-
ing the course of the summer. 
In July, our colleagues introduced 
the HEALS Act, which would have pro-
vided just under a trillion dollars in re-
lief, covering the same types of policies 
included in the most recent relief bill— 
direct payments, unemployment bene-
fits, funding for schools, vaccines, and 
a host of other priorities. 
Our Democratic colleagues not only 
complained about the bill, but they 
called it weak, little, pathetic, and 
unserious. They refused to engage in 
the sorts of negotiations that are cus-
tomary around here when you actually 
want to solve a problem or consider 
anything short of the House’s multi-
trillion-dollar bill, which they knew 
had no chance of passing in the Senate 
because of things like tax cuts for mil-
lionaires and billionaires, which had 
nothing to do with COVID. 
So 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
dragged their feet—July, August, Sep-
tember, October, November. Months 
went by, and the cases soared, and the 
economic squeeze tightened, and our 
Democratic colleagues refused to ac-
cept any sort of compromise. 
That was until a few weeks ago, when 
they finally changed their tune right 
after the election. I am sure it comes 
as no surprise that once the holdout 
agrees to negotiate, things can move 
pretty quickly, and that is what hap-
pened here after the election. Demo-
crats, Republicans, and the administra-
tion agreed to a $900 billion package, 
which looks very similar to the one 
they dubbed pathetic just a few months 
ago. 
In recent days, the President has ex-
pressed an interest in doing more, and 
I have no doubt that we will do more in 
this area, but Speaker PELOSI’s bill 
goes far beyond what the President is 
talking about. For one, it would dra-
matically widen the pool of recipients, 
enabling wealthy households to qualify 
for relief checks. This is unacceptable 
and wasteful. 
When Congress provided the first 
round of direct payments through the 
CARES Act, we did so in a way that 
sent relief to the hardest hit Ameri-
cans. Individuals who made up to 
$75,000 received the full $1,200, and the 
amount gradually declined as income 
increased and completely phased out at 
$99,000. We kept the same formula for 
the $600 payments provided for under 
the omnibus and further targeted the 
relief. Once again, those who made up 
to $75,000 will receive the full amount, 
and the amount phases out completely 
at $87,000. 
Under the CARES Act, a family of 
four earning up to $150,000 received 
$3,400, and in the most recent rescue 
bill, the same family would receive an 
additional $2,400. This was the most ef-
fective and targeted way to ensure that 
assistance goes to those who actually 
need it while avoiding sending tax-
payer dollars—borrowed, I might add— 
to those who don’t. 
The House-passed legislation would 
provide $2,000 payments, but it doesn’t 
have a similar structure to keep these 
payments targeted. Let me give you an 
example. 
If this bill were to become law, a per-
son making $100,000 a year would re-
ceive a $750 check from the Federal 
Government, whether or not they lost 
income during the pandemic. This isn’t 
someone who used to make that much 
but was laid off or had a reduction in 
their income. Someone who is cur-
rently 
earning 
a 
six-figure 
salary 
would receive an additional $750 from 
American taxpayers. 
For families, the income barrier goes 
higher. As I mentioned a moment ago, 
if you have a family of five with an an-
nual household income of $350,000 a 
year, that family would receive a stim-
ulus check under the House-passed bill. 
Now, that is not being smart with tax-
payer dollars, and that is not targeted 
at the people who actually need it. 
That is a giveaway to people who have 
not suffered any financial losses during 
this pandemic and clearly not targeted 
at those who need the most help. 
I mentioned a moment ago that the 
median income for households in Texas 
is $60,000 a year, so this family of five 
is earning nearly six times as much 
and would still receive a check from 
taxpayers. That defies all common 
sense. Even the Washington Post edi-
torial board dubbed this policy as 
wasteful because of the huge amounts 
destined for what they call ‘‘perfectly 
comfortable families.’’ 
Even though Congress has already 
provided roughly $4 trillion in relief to 
the American people, our Democratic 
colleagues are acting as though this is 
the first and only way to help our 
country. 
Like I said, for them, every day is 
Groundhog Day. They ignore every-
thing we have done in the past and act 
like this is the only thing we have or 
could do. It is just not true. 
This debate isn’t about whether or 
not Congress should help families who 
are struggling. We have. And there is 
no question we will continue to do so 
where needed. That is why we provided 
$1,200 in direct payments to the hardest 
hit Americans through the CARES Act 
and an additional $600 through the 
most recent relief bill. That is why 
these bills also bolstered State unem-
ployment benefits and expanded them 
to include independent contractors and 
the self-employed. That is why Con-
gress passed legislation to provide food 
assistance to families, keep more hard- 
working Americans on payroll, and en-
sure our economy is on track for a 
strong recovery. 
Again, we did this thanks to the lead-
ership of President Trump and by 
working together in a bipartisan way. 
Countless Texans have told me about 
the impact of this relief on their busi-
nesses and their families, and we can’t 
lose sight of the progress that has al-
ready been made. But future relief 
must be targeted. We need to support 
those who need it and avoid sending 
hundreds of billions of dollars, as this 
proposal would, to those who don’t 
need it. 
Throughout the year, I have been an 
advocate for an incremental approach 
to these relief bills because I think it is 
hard to spend $3 trillion and know ex-
actly how that bill is going to work. 
And, indeed, we found out through the 
CARES Act that the mainstream lend-
ing facility, which we funded at rough-
ly half a trillion dollars, wasn’t as use-
ful as we would have hoped. 
Conversely, the Paycheck Protection 
Program was more successful than our 
wildest dreams. So I think by seeing 
what works and what doesn’t work, we 
can be better stewards of taxpayer dol-
lars by spending the money more effi-
ciently and in a more targeted way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7979 
December 30, 2020 
This isn’t like highway bills or farm 
bills or defense spending bills where we 
have an idea about what is needed for 
individual programs. There was no 
precedent for this pandemic, no hand-
book, and no clear way to gauge how 
long this crisis would go on or what 
would be needed to sustain our re-
sponse. 
After the CARES Act passed, we 
knew it made the most sense to hit the 
pause button and see what worked 
well, what didn’t, and where more help 
was needed. As I said, there were cer-
tain programs like the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program that almost imme-
diately dried up. If I am not mistaken, 
in 2 weeks, roughly $350 billion was ob-
ligated under the Paycheck Protection 
Program—a strong indication that we 
really hit the sweet spot when it came 
to helping those small businesses. That 
is why we added more funding in April, 
another $320 billion, and we extended 
the program in July and reinvested in 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
again in the omnibus. 
As I said, there were other places 
where the money went unspent. But, 
fortunately, in the most recent bill we 
were able to repurpose hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in unspent funds, again, 
to target it to where the need was 
greatest and where it could help the 
most. 
There is no question that tens of mil-
lions of workers and their families 
have been hurt by this virus. We all 
know that. And I think we have all 
acted together, by and large, respon-
sibly, in trying to respond to that. No 
one will be left out if we have a means 
and method of targeting this to those 
people—whether it is direct payments, 
enhanced unemployment benefits, in-
centives to their employers to main-
tain them on payroll. And now that we 
have the beginning of the distribution 
of the vaccine, my hope is that in the 
coming months we will get back to, if 
not the new normal, whatever the next 
normal will be. 
But we are just a few days from kick-
ing off the new Congress, and I have no 
reason to believe that our coronavirus 
relief work is finished here today. As a 
matter of fact, Vice President Biden 
said that he expects to send us an addi-
tional request for help once he assumes 
office. 
Once the legislation we have passed 
has a chance to benefit the American 
people, we will see if more relief is 
needed, and then, if it is needed, we 
should absolutely do more. 
I still believe in the wisdom of the in-
cremental approach, and I believe our 
Democratic friends will join us in re-
sponding to the true needs of this crisis 
without monthlong delays or irrespon-
sible spending. 
Countless Texans have told me about 
the importance of the relief we have 
provided through direct payments, un-
employment benefits, food assistance, 
and other forms of support by the laws 
we passed throughout this year. I was 
proud to support each of those policies, 
which have eased the financial strains 
on millions of Texans and other Ameri-
cans. I will continue to work with our 
colleagues to provide assistance as our 
war on COVID–19 rages on. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have 
heard a lot of revisionist history this 
afternoon. 
Look back in March, when Congress 
did the right thing and the Senate 
voted unanimously. Because of our ef-
forts, 13 million people were kept out 
of poverty—we know that—because we 
provided relatively generous unem-
ployment insurance. We did the direct 
payments. We helped with small busi-
ness loans. But then this Senate 
thought its work was done for the year. 
We begged Senator MCCONNELL month 
after month after month to come back 
and help. 
As I said, 13 million people were kept 
out of poverty because of the work this 
Congress did in March of this year, but 
now, since—many of those benefits, es-
pecially the unemployment benefit and 
the direct payments, were not contin-
ued, of course. Those benefits expired 
in August, and we have seen 8 million 
people drop into poverty in this coun-
try since. Yet Senator MCCONNELL re-
fuses and refuses and refuses. 
I hear this revisionist history that 
Democrats just want to help people 
who are already affluent and give them 
more money. Well, remember back in 
March, the only amendment that we 
considered, the only amendment that 
Senator MCCONNELL
allowed on the 
floor of the Senate to the CARES Act, 
the only amendment was to take away 
the $600-a-week unemployment insur-
ance. 
The 
only 
place 
Republicans 
fought was the $600-a-week unemploy-
ment insurance. That more than any 
single thing we did is why people were 
kept out of poverty. Now the best we 
could do was $300-a-week unemploy-
ment insurance—the best we could do. 
In spite of Senator CORNYN’s and oth-
ers’ comments, Senator MCCONNELL 
waited, waited, waited, and waited. Fi-
nally, we were able to do that. 
The President of the United States 
threatened to veto it, causing millions 
of Americans to fall off their unem-
ployment insurance. We know all that. 
It is just important to remember all 
that. 
But there is one simple question be-
fore the Senate this week: Are we 
going to put more money into people’s 
pockets? The American people made it 
clear on election day that they want a 
government that is on their side. This 
is our chance to deliver for them, to 
show people whom we serve that we 
can make a real difference in their 
lives, which we did back in March. 
It is pretty simple. The best way to 
help Ohio workers and families is to 
put more money in their pockets, not 
in the bank accounts of the largest cor-
porations and biggest banks, hoping it 
will trickle down. We know it never 
does. The CEOs just pay themselves in-
stead. 
We know that just recently there was 
more good news for American CEOs 
who 
are 
able 
again 
to 
do 
stock 
buybacks, more dividend distributions. 
A lot of corporations have made a lot 
of money—more power to them—during 
this pandemic, but those are the cor-
porations that continue to get the big 
tax breaks. 
We need, instead, to directly invest 
in people who make this country work. 
It helps people pay the bills and stay in 
their homes and get through this down-
turn. It injects money into local econo-
mies that really need it. The more 
money people have, the more they 
spend in small businesses that are 
hurting. 
We know this works. It did in the 
spring. We came together. We crossed 
the aisle, passed the CARES Act, ex-
panded unemployment, and provided 
direct stimulus checks, keeping 13 mil-
lion people out of poverty. The bill we 
passed last week was a good step in 
that direction, but we should make it 
stronger. 
Back in March, my original plan that 
I tried to negotiate as I sat with Sec-
retary Mnuchin and a handful of other 
Senators was $2,000 per person, adults 
and children. We called for it to be sent 
automatically throughout the year, 
every quarter, as long as we remained 
in a public health emergency. 
It is clear now what we could have 
done and should have done. No one 
could predict how long this crisis 
would last. Today, we still aren’t sure 
when everybody will be vaccinated and 
when the economy will return to full 
strength. We don’t want to sit idly by. 
We don’t want to wonder how bad it 
could get. We are the strongest, richest 
country on Earth. We have the re-
sources to do something about it; we 
just need leadership willing to use 
every tool we have. 
If they refuse to support this $2,000 
per person, if they refuse to support 
these direct payments, Leader MCCON-
NELL
and Senate Republicans will 
again make it perfectly clear to the 
American people whose side they are 
on. 
Every time there is a fork in the road 
and Senator MCCONNELL
and Senate 
Republicans have to make a decision— 
either go with corporate interests or go 
with working families—every single 
time, they choose corporate interests. 
They had no problem pouring money 
into corporate coffers with their tax 
cut and blowing up the deficit. 
Just down the hall here in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s office, I remember lobby-
ists lining up, looking for those tax 
cuts back 3 years ago, and they got 
those tax cuts. They didn’t say any-
thing about government deficits back 
then—$1.5 trillion added to the deficit. 
They didn’t mind that because that 
was money going into their contribu-
tors’ pockets, into big corporate coffers

December 30, 2020 
for the wealthiest people in this coun-
try. They were all too happy to let the 
government shovel loans to the biggest 
banks and companies. But in the mid-
dle of the worst crisis of our lifetime, 
faced with the chance to give money 
directly to ordinary Americans, my 
colleagues claim we can’t afford it. 
That is just simply a lie. We are the 
richest country on Earth. 
I remember Bill Spriggs—an econo-
mist at Howard University—told the 
Banking and Housing Committee in 
September: We didn’t win World War II 
by worrying about whether or not we 
could afford it. We were in a global cri-
sis. We marshalled all our vast re-
sources and talents to rise to meet it. 
We grew the economy from the middle 
class out. We paid down the debt with 
rising wages. 
If we have learned anything from the 
crisis, it should be that we can do the 
same again. Americans are tired of 
being told we can’t. It is the only an-
swer that Senator MCCONNELL and Sen-
ate Republicans ever have for most 
people’s problems: We can’t help you. 
We can’t solve your problem. You are 
on your own. 
Let’s aim higher. Let’s deliver for the 
people we serve. Let’s put $2,000 into 
their pockets—money that will make 
such a difference for so many families. 
It will help a mother worried about 
how she will pay back rent. It will keep 
a laid off restaurant worker from turn-
ing to a payday lender. It will allow a 
father to buy a new computer so his 
kids are better able to learn online. 
These are millions of real people—peo-
ple we swore an oath to serve who 
would breathe a little easier this new 
year if we pass this. 
So let’s be clear about the decision 
today and this week before the Senate. 
Are we going to give the people we 
serve $2,000, or are you going to stand 
in the way? It is that simple. Let’s 
come together. Let’s pass this. Let’s 
make a real difference in people’s lives. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is 
what I have considered to be—and I 
have heard my friend from the Demo-
cratic side, the minority side, say the 
same thing, that this is the most sig-
nificant bill that we pass every year. 
It is the NDAA, the National Defense 
Authorization Act. This will be the 
60th year—is it the 60th or 61st year? 
Mr. REED. The 60th. 
Mr. INHOFE. OK. It is the 60th year 
that we have passed this, and it has 
passed every year. There were a few 
moments there where I thought maybe 
it wasn’t going to pass this year and we 
would set a record. Senator REED and I 
don’t want to set that kind of record. 
We want to make sure we get this 
done. 
The reason this is important is this 
is the blueprint. This tells us what we 
are going to be doing with our troops. 
I could make an argument that it is 
really—we are in the most dangerous 
situation, I think, that we have been in 
before. I have often talked about the 
good old days when we had the Cold 
War with two superpowers. We knew 
what the Soviet Union had; they knew 
what we had. Mutually assured de-
struction meant something at that 
time. 
But now it is different in a lot of re-
spects because you have rogue coun-
tries out there that have weapons and 
have abilities to wipe out nations. That 
is why it is so significant. 
So, anyway, we suffered through a 
little bit of a problem back during the 
Obama administration, during the last 
5 years, which would have been from 
2010 to 2015. In his budget, he down-
graded the military by 25 percent, and 
that is the same time, during that 
timeframe, that China increased theirs 
by 83 percent. 
So it is a scary world out there, and 
it is one that, to me, I have no doubt 
that this is the most important bill 
that we will pass all year because we 
have got our kids, and they are out 
there right now. They are in the 
trenches, and we have to support them. 
That is what it is all about. 
I do want to mention how many peo-
ple are involved in this thing. We are 
actually starting this right now. We 
are starting next year’s NDAA. So this 
started a year ago. The ones working 
on this—you have Liz King and John 
Bonsell heading up the minority and 
majority part of the committee, doing 
a great job and working every week-
end—almost every weekend—with a 
very large staff, all specialists in cer-
tain areas. And they have got the bill. 
So I am very proud of the bill that we 
have this year. I think that it passed, 
when it passed in the Senate, it was 84 
to—I think it was 84 to 14, I think it 
was. I think there were a couple of peo-
ple not here. But that is the largest— 
that doesn’t happen very often, to pass 
a bill with those margins, and we did. 
So this is a long tradition. We have 
got to support our troops. They are in 
there doing the right thing. It has been 
a joy, personally, for me to be working 
with Senator REED, and we have, to-
gether, kind of provided the leadership 
on this thing. We didn’t work as hard 
as the staff did. I admit that. But we 
were there, and I am very proud of this 
bill. 
So right now we have kids that are 
overseas, and they deserve the pay that 
was increased—that would be increased 
when this bill is passed. Right now, we 
have critical areas like pilots and engi-
neers, doctors, that are in short supply 
because of the fact that we have had, 
up until the pandemic, a good and 
probably, I would argue, the best econ-
omy we have had in my lifetime. 
Well, that is good news, of course, 
but it is bad news in one way because 
it is hard to keep the people in those 
critical 
fields—pilots, 
for 
example. 
They have an opportunity to get out 
and do things that are—there are jobs 
out there that are paying a lot more. 
So we have to have them on the flight 
hours if something happens. And they 
are out—there are a lot of jobs on the 
outside that are paying more. So we 
just have to make sure that we keep 
the resources in the right place to do 
the right job. 
So I think this is the—I know this 
procedural vote today is going to bring 
us, in the next couple of days, to pass 
the Defense authorization bill. 
It is all about the guys and gals in 
the field. We owe it to them. This is 
going to be the 60th year. I anticipate 
that this is going to pass with very 
large numbers. 
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from Rhode Island. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would 
like to rise and discuss the Fiscal Year 
2021 National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
First, I would like to salute the 
chairman. He has done an extraor-
dinary job. We have both served on the 
committee for many years, and this is 
probably the most challenging year we 
have had due to many different factors: 
the pandemic, the virtual hearings, all 
those things. 
And this has been particularly chal-
lenging, and the chairman, at every 
point, stood up to the challenge and led 
us. I want to thank him for that. It was 
a pleasure working with him. 
We all recognize that this legislation 
passed both Chambers, the House and 
the Senate, by overwhelming bipar-
tisan majorities. And it is very impor-
tant legislation. That is why it earned 
this bipartisan support. 
It enhances our national security. It 
strengthens our military readiness and 
defense capabilities. It protects our 
forces and their families and supports 
the defense industrial base. 
Despite all that it does for our troops 
and their families, President Trump 
waited until the 10th day after he re-
ceived it and vetoed it the last day he 
could exercise his veto. That was De-
cember 23, which made quite a Christ-
mas for our military personnel and for 
all of my colleagues who are here today 
to start the process of responding to 
that veto. 
The House already took the first 
step. They returned on Monday. Once 
again, by an overwhelming vote, over 
300 Members of the House overrode the 
President’s veto. Now we face the same 
task in the Senate. It is my hope we 
can quickly and resoundingly override

the President’s veto and provide our 
troops with what they need. 
I will echo what the chairman said. 
You can go through all the thousands 
of pages, literally, but what is the most 
significant aspect of this legislation is 
keeping faith with the men and women 
who wear the uniform of the United 
States. So if anyone has any thoughts 
about their vote, just think about 
those men and women who are all 
across the world putting their lives at 
risk while their families share that 
risk and that sense of danger and sac-
rifice. That is what I think has moti-
vated the chairman and myself and all 
of our colleagues on the committee and 
throughout this Senate to work hard to 
get this bill passed. 
There are several reasons being ad-
vanced by the President for suggesting 
that this bill should be vetoed—the 
veto should be upheld. One reason is 
that he claims the bill fails to include 
critical national security measures. 
Yet this legislation provides critical 
tools and authorities for the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to perform 
network hunting for threats and vul-
nerabilities 
on 
Federal 
networks. 
These tools and authorities would help 
to 
counter 
breaches 
like 
the 
SolarWinds hack, which is possibly the 
largest intrusion into our system we 
have ever seen by a foreign nation 
state adversary. We do not yet know 
the extent and the degree of intrusion 
that we have suffered. In fact, we 
weren’t aware of this intrusion for 
many, many months. 
One of the disconcerting aspects is 
that it was discovered by a private 
company that is one of the most, if not 
the most sophisticated cyber intrusion 
expert in the world. Yet they were pen-
etrated. 
So we have a serious, serious situa-
tion on our hands. This legislation 
would start giving basic tools, which 
would allow our cyber security experts 
to go into other Departments to look 
at their procedures, their policies, all 
of their cyber activities, and rec-
ommend corrections. 
In fact, this bill has done more, I 
think, for cyber based on the work of 
the Cyber Solarium Commission, which 
was chaired by Senator ANGUS KING 
and Congressman MIKE GALLAGHER of 
Wisconsin and also aided significantly 
by my colleague Congressman JIM LAN-
GEVIN of Rhode Island. They put the 
work together. We took a lot of the So-
larium’s work and put it into this bill. 
So there is absolutely no credence to 
the issue that we have not dealt with 
national security and cyber intrusions 
in particular. 
Then again, the President, in his veto 
message, wrote that one of the reasons 
is the failure to essentially repeal sec-
tion 230 of the Communications De-
cency Act. But this issue has nothing 
to do with the military—nothing at all. 
It was designed years ago to provide 
legal protections to social media com-
panies so that they could expand and 
grow. Frankly, I think it has worked 
beyond our wildest imaginations. Ev-
eryone recognizes it should be re-
formed, but reform requires thought-
ful, responsible analysis of the legisla-
tion. The effects of the legislation 
should offer both sides the opportunity 
to explain positions. None of that was 
done, and none of that can be done be-
fore we conclude this legislative ses-
sion. 
It is more, I think, a personal feud of 
the President, the section 230 repeal, 
than it is one of careful, deliberate, 
thoughtful legislation by the Senate. 
There is another reason the Presi-
dent has used, and that is we have es-
tablished a commission to make rec-
ommendations for the renaming and 
removal of symbols, displays, monu-
ments, and paraphernalia that honor or 
commemorate Confederates who served 
voluntarily 
with 
the 
Confederacy. 
There is a clear exemption, by the way, 
for gravestones that we would abso-
lutely respect. But these individuals— 
many of them who were on Active serv-
ice with our Army or Navy at the 
time—decided 
to 
consciously 
fight 
against the United States of America. 
It is that simple. Yet we have bases 
that are named after them. 
The President said this is part of the 
American heritage of victory and free-
dom, but, again, these are named after 
men who took up arms against the 
United States. In some cases—in most 
cases, they weren’t particularly exem-
plary generals, with some exceptions. 
And it was done in a way that I think 
was not to honor the service of these 
individuals but to advance other forces. 
I think it is time that this history be 
changed, that this chapter be closed, 
and the senior Defense Department of-
ficials have indicated they are open to 
these changes. There is bipartisan sup-
port for cooperation on this issue. It 
passed the committee. It passed the 
floor. It passed the House. Now, it is in 
this legislation. 
When the President vetoed the bill, 
he also said it is a ‘‘gift to China and 
Russia.’’ I would strenuously disagree. 
This is one of the strongest bills yet on 
countering the threat China poses to 
the United States and our partners, in-
cluding allies such as India, Taiwan, 
and other countries and regions. 
Among the provisions of this legisla-
tion is the Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive. That is a new authority for the 
Department of Defense, modeled after 
the European Deterrence Initiative and 
authorizes an additional $150 million in 
funding. 
This was the work—I was proud to 
collaborate, but the lead was the chair-
man, Chairman INHOFE, and I was his 
copilot on that one. This is the first 
time we really stepped back and said: 
We have a new threat—significant 
threat—rising in the Pacific. We have 
to take a holistic review of strategy, 
capabilities, equipment, and we have to 
make this a top priority. 
So rather than doing nothing about 
China, as the President alleges, I think 
we have made one of the most signifi-
cant steps forward in consciously rec-
ognizing the relationship that has de-
veloped between China and the United 
States. 
With regard to Russia and Europe, 
the conference report enhances our 
ability to deter Russian aggression, 
maintains strong support for Ukraine, 
and reaffirms our commitment to the 
transatlantic partnership, including by 
calling for a strong U.S. force posture 
in Germany. 
Now, President Trump also vetoed 
this legislation because he wants the 
ability to remove our military from 
‘‘far away and very unappreciative 
lands.’’ Those are his words. Particu-
larly, I have concern about the situa-
tion in Afghanistan. First—and I have 
been to Afghanistan somewhere close 
to 20 times—since the beginning. 
In fact, I was on the first congres-
sional delegation to go in January 
after the invasion. I have tried to pay 
attention to what is going on there. 
And one point is that the Afghan peo-
ple have struggled and fought with us 
side by side. They have suffered great-
ly. I don’t think it is right to say they 
are unappreciative. I think every day 
they have been suffering casualties. 
They have been fighting with our sol-
diers—in fact, in some cases, saving 
and helping our soldiers survive on the 
field. 
Second, essentially, the provision al-
lows the President to make the deci-
sion. In fact, he can waive all the pro-
visions we built in by simply declaring 
that it is in the national security in-
terests of the United States and com-
municating that to the respective lead-
ers in the House and the Senate. That 
is something that is almost pro forma. 
So the notion that this seriously ham-
pers his ability is misplaced. 
What it does, though, is signal that 
we have to be very careful in recog-
nizing all of the equities that are in-
volved in Afghanistan. The fact is that 
there are numerous terrorist groups 
there, and we have to maintain a coun-
terterrorism presence; the fact that, as 
I indicated before, the Government of 
Afghanistan, the Afghan people, in 
many cases, have suffered more than 
we have considering the onslaught of 
the Taliban and other forces. So, again, 
I don’t think that reason measures up 
to the demands. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act has passed for 59 years. We need to 
ensure it will pass for 60 years by over-
riding the President’s veto. The House, 
as I said, has already done that—322 to 
87. I encourage my colleagues to show 
similar support for our military per-
sonnel and their families and override 
this veto. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me 
elaborate a little bit on something that 
my good friend from Rhode Island said 
about China. 
I think it is very, very significant 
that we realize that this is the tough-
est bill on China that has ever been

December 30, 2020 
passed. That didn’t come just from me; 
that came from the American Enter-
prise Institute, which has all the credi-
bility in the world. They talk about 
the serious things that are going on, 
and they actually said this bill has the 
most substantial and consequential 
China-related 
provisions 
since—in, 
probably, history. 
That is significant because all of us 
remember—I know that Senator REED 
and I have both spent time in the 
South China Sea, the seven islands 
that they are doing right now. China— 
it is illegal, but they have taken over— 
no, they have created seven islands in 
the South China Sea. When you go 
down there, it looks as if, on those is-
lands, they are preparing for World 
War III. A lot of our allies in that area 
are very much concerned because they 
are making a lot more noise than we 
are, and they are demonstrating very 
clearly some of the things that they do 
that we haven’t done. Hypersonics is an 
example. That is a state-of-the-art 
thing that we do in modernizing our 
military equipment and abilities. It 
has been very successful, but they are 
still ahead of us, so we are in catchup 
mode. 
I would say this: When you go and 
you look and you see the buildups that 
they have—I can remember—it wasn’t 
long ago that every time China got in-
volved in any kind of an effort, they 
did it from their own city limits there. 
Now they are all over Djibouti, Tan-
zania, and all around the world. 
We made this bill to establish the Pa-
cific Deterrence Initiative. That is $2.2 
billion for foreign posture to put our-
selves in the position where we are 
going to pass, with this bill—we will 
pass China, and then we will be shifting 
the supply chains away from China— 
semiconductors and printed circuit 
boards, the pharmaceuticals—stimu-
lating the U.S. economy, protecting 
weapons systems and our troops, and 
bringing China’s malign national secu-
rity activities into light to make sure 
everybody knows what they are doing 
there. 
We have a new report in this bill on 
the true China defense security spend-
ing, new assessments of China’s indus-
trial base, new list of Chinese compa-
nies operating in the United States and 
making it more difficult for them to do 
that. It is all in this bill. There is a 
new report on the fishing fleets they 
have out there. It extends the success-
ful China Military Power Report, sup-
ports Taiwan and a new plan against— 
that is better than anything we have 
ever done before. 
Yesterday, 
I 
put 
this 
into 
the 
record—all the things that we are 
doing just concentrating on the threat 
that is posed to the United States from 
the country of China. It is all in this 
bill. So this is something we have 
taken great pride in because we recog-
nize the threat that is posed to our 
country from the Chinese. 
This is a good bill. It is one that de-
serves overwhelming support. I will say 
one more time that a lot of work went 
into this from both sides of the aisle. 
We were in agreement on it with huge 
margins of support in both Chambers of 
the House and the Senate. We will have 
a chance to move procedurally toward 
that and make that a reality before the 
end of the week.

f 
GUN VIOLENCE IN ILLINOIS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we 
work to combat the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we must not forget our Nation’s 
epidemic of gun violence that kills 
over 100 Americans every day. 
Even during the holiday season, the 
deadly toll of shootings has continued. 
On the day after Christmas, a gun-
man opened fire at a bowling alley res-
taurant in Rockford, IL, killing three 
and wounding three more. Mayor Tom 
McNamara has shown real leadership 
in this crisis. I ask unanimous consent 
that his statement be printed in the 
RECORD following my remarks. 
Thomas Furseth, Dennis Steinhoff, 
and Jerome Woodfork were murdered 
in that shooting. Among the wounded 
victims were a 14-year-old boy and a 16- 
year-old girl. 
We mourn the lives we lost and pray 
for all the victims and their families. 
We also give thanks to the first re-
sponders who so often rush toward the 
sound of gunfire so they can save as 
many lives as they can. 
In this case, officers from the Rock-
ford Police Department arrived at the 
scene within 1 minute of the 911 calls 
and took the shooter into custody. 
Their conduct may sound routine to 
some, but make no mistake, their lives 
were at risk, and their courage was ex-
ceptional. We should never take the 
valor of so many in law enforcement 
for granted. 
In the city of Chicago, at least 30 
people were shot, 8 fatally, during the 
Christmas weekend. 
The victims included a 57-year-old 
man who was killed while driving in 
his car, a young man killed while 
standing in a park at 9 in the morning, 
and a 24-year-old woman killed while 
sitting in a parked car. 
We mourn these victims and pray for 
their families and for the wounded. But 
we must also dedicate ourselves to re-
ducing these deadly shootings and to 
making our streets, our schools, and 
our neighborhoods safer. 
This is a national problem. According 
to the Gun Violence Archive, on 
Christmas Day and the day after, there 
were six mass shootings across the 
country, defined as an incident where 
at least four people were shot. There 
have been 23 such shootings so far in 
December. Has this wanton, deadly vio-
lence become so routine that we are 
numb to it until it touches our homes 
and our families? 
We must do better. Have we become 
so indifferent to gun violence in Amer-
ica that Senators in the highest legis-
lative body in our land refuse to try to 
make our Nation safer? We must work 
for reforms like universal background 
checks and cracking down on illicit 
gun trafficking. And we must work to 
support children and families who have 
faced violent trauma and to address 
disparities in healthcare and economic 
opportunity that contribute to in-
creased violence. 
Too many funerals, too many tears, 
too many lives lost to the scourge of 
gun violence. 
We must do better. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD. as follows: 
EMAIL FROM ROCKFORD MAYOR TOM 
MCNAMARA RE DEC. 26 SHOOTING 
Dear Friend, 
As we all know, it has been such a difficult 
year and now a tragic week for our city. Last 
Saturday, three people lost their lives in a 
horrific and random act of violence at Don 
Carter Lanes, a long-time anchor of our com-
munity. Three others sustained serious inju-
ries in the attack, with two of them still 
fighting for their lives. As we move to the 
conclusion of what has already been an ardu-
ous year, we find ourselves coming together 
to support the families who lost their loved 
ones, the survivors and their families, and 
the employees and owners of Don Carter 
Lanes. 
Don Carter Lanes is a staple in Rockford 
and has been for decades. It’s a family-owned 
business that hosts tournaments, charity 
fundraisers, birthday parties and also is a 
long-time supporter of our business commu-
nity. This is a difficult time for owner Brad 
Sommer, the employees, and the entire bowl-
ing family. I know we will come together as 
a community to support them during this 
time. 
Rockford is at its best when times are 
tough and already we’ve seen examples of 
this in the wake of Saturday night’s inci-
dent. The Rockford Police officers who re-
sponded within one minute of the first 911 
call are heroes who ran toward the danger. 
They entered the building quickly and with-
out hesitation to protect lives and apprehend 
the suspect. We should all be grateful for 
their actions. 
GOFUNDME FUNDRAISER 
While working through the trauma of this 
incident, the owners of Don Carter Lanes set 
up a GoFundMe fundraiser to benefit the 
shooting victims and families. You can do-
nate by visiting: https://gofund.me/62caa4df. 
ILLINOIS BANK & TRUST CARE FUND 
And, Miracle Mile Rockford, a business as-
sociation 
serving 
owners, 
neighborhood 
groups and residents in the area around Don 
Carter Lanes, has set up a care fund in part-
nership with Illinois Bank & Trust to accept 
donations to benefit the families impacted 
by the shootings. IBT has begun the fund 
with a generous $5,000 donation and commu-
nity donations can be made at any IBT loca-
tion or via online or mobile banking. Click 
Here to donate or for more info. 
While 
last 
week’s 
events 
are 
heart-
breaking, we can all be proud of and heart-
ened by the reaction of our community. 
Thank you for your continued support of my 
work as your mayor and for your support of 
our great city.
