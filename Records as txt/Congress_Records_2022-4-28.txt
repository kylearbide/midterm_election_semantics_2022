IN SUPPORT OF THE ALZHEIMER’S 
COMMUNITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of the 
millions of Americans living with Alz-
heimer’s disease, and their family 
members and caregivers. 
I am speaking up because the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
CMS, made a decision that will se-
verely limit access to the only drug 
shown to slow the progression of Alz-
heimer’s. I think their decision is a 
mistake. 
Alzheimer’s is a heartbreaking dis-
ease. It has no cure. These are the faces 
of Alzheimer’s. They are our sisters, 
our brothers, our mothers, our fathers, 
our neighbors, our grandparents, our 
fellow Americans, who are living with 
this dreadful disease. As time passes, 
they are slipping away from their loved 
ones a little bit at a time. They have 
asked and hoped for something to help 
them. Anything. Anything that could 
give them more time with their fami-
lies. 
For the past 20 years, there has been 
little progress on new Alzheimer’s 
drugs. Like too many other Americans, 
I have had the heartbreaking experi-
ence of watching my mother struggle 
with Alzheimer’s, and still have the 
challenge of finding sufficient care-
givers to help care for her and those 
who speak Spanish. My mother’s story 
is not unique. Nearly 6 million people 
in the United States are suffering from 
Alzheimer’s, and this number is grow-
ing every single day. 
Last summer, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approved the first new 
Alzheimer’s drug, providing hope for 
families. But CMS will not cover it. 
They finalized a coverage policy that 
will tightly restrict access to the en-
tire and only known class of drug that 
has shown promise to slow the progres-
sion of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Is that the way we should respond to 
this crisis? 
This is an access issue. People who 
have money and can pay for it will get 
the drug. People who are under a CMS 
program will not. 
Every day, Americans living with 
Alzheimer’s are burdened with the ex-
pense of caregivers, doctors’ visits, and 
seeing their family members decline. 
This is why my colleagues and I wrote 
a letter urging CMS not to limit access 
to breakthrough therapies for Alz-
heimer’s patients. And as a representa-
tive of over 150,000 Angelenos who are 
living with Alzheimer’s disease, I am 
deeply disappointed with CMS’s deci-
sion. These are my constituents and 
members of my community, as well as 
yours. Time is not on our side in this 
fight. 
To all the patients, families, and 
caregivers out there who are struggling 
with Alzheimer’s, I am not done. I 
stand with you and I will continue to 
fight for you. 
f 
APPOINTMENTS TO THE NATION’S 
SERVICE ACADEMIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate 
the men and women from Pennsylva-
nia’s 13th Congressional District who 
have received appointments to our Na-
tion’s service academies. Through their 
academic work, their commitment to 
physical fitness, and their readiness to 
serve, 
these 
students 
have 
dem-
onstrated that they are ready to begin 
the training that will ultimately lead 
to their commissioning as officers in 
our Armed Services. 
This morning, I am proud to recog-
nize: 
Elizabeth Pfisterer of Adams County, 
who will attend the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point; 
Brian Johnson of Blair County, who 
will attend the United States Naval 
Academy at Annapolis; 
Eli Burtner of Somerset County, who 
will attend the United States Military 
Academy at West Point; 
Nathan Kirkwood of Franklin Coun-
ty, who will attend the United States 
Naval Academy in Annapolis; and 
Meagan McHale of Franklin County, 
who will attend the United States Mer-
chant 
Marine 
Academy 
in 
Nassau 
County, New York.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4578 
April 28, 2022 
Thanks to these excellent young men 
and women, their commitment to our 
Nation and to our military must be 
recognized. The soldiers, the sailors, 
the airmen, and marines that you will 
one day be asked to lead deserve offi-
cers who are disciplined and thought-
ful. 
Thank you for your commitment to 
our country, and may God bless you 
and your families as you begin this new 
chapter of your lives. Today, I con-
gratulate you. 
f 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, a proud, liberated 
Democrat. 
I rise today on this occasion of re-
membrance, remembrance of the vic-
tims of the Holocaust. I rise to asso-
ciate myself with comments that have 
been made by others. 
I would first note for the RECORD 
that there was a joint resolution ap-
proved on September 18, 1978, a joint 
resolution designating April 28 and 29 
of 1979 as Days of Remembrance of Vic-
tims of the Holocaust. 
President Carter, who signed H.J. 
Res. 1014, Public Law 95–371, approved 
on September 18, 1978, indicated in a 
public statement, ‘‘The resolution was 
passed unanimously by both Houses of 
Congress. This reflects our Nation’s 
wholehearted conviction that the les-
sons of the Holocaust must never be 
forgotten.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I acknowledge and 
associate myself with a statement from 
President Joe Biden, dated April 22, 
2022. It is styled, ‘‘A Proclamation on 
Days of Remembrance of Victims of 
the Holocaust, 2022.’’ 
In 
this 
statement, 
he 
indicates, 
among many other things that I asso-
ciate myself with, ‘‘The world must 
never forget the truth of what hap-
pened across Europe during the Holo-
caust or forget the horrific crimes and 
suffering the Nazi regime inflicted on 
millions’’—I underscore it by saying it 
twice—‘‘millions of innocent people.’’ 
A PROCLAMATION ON DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE 
OF VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST, 2022 
On Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, and throughout this week of re-
membrance, we reflect on the horrors of the 
Holocaust when the Nazi regime systemati-
cally murdered 6 million Jews and millions 
of other innocents, including Roma, Sinti, 
Slavs, persons with disabilities, LGBTQI+ in-
dividuals, political dissidents, and many oth-
ers. We stand with Jewish people in the 
United States, Israel, and around the world 
in grieving one of the darkest chapters in 
history. We honor the memories of the vic-
tims. We embrace the survivors. We commit 
to keeping alive the promise of ‘‘never 
again.’’ 
The world must never forget the truth of 
what happened across Europe during the Hol-
ocaust or forget the horrific crimes and suf-
fering the Nazi regime inflicted on millions 
of innocent people. Entire families were 
wiped out. Communities were shattered. Sur-
vivors were left with agonizing memories 
and fading tattoos etched into their skin by 
the Nazis, reducing them to numbers. It is 
forever recorded into the history of man-
kind, and it is the shared responsibility of us 
all to ensure that the Shoah is never erased 
from our collective memory—especially as 
fewer and fewer survivors remain. The truth 
must always be known and shared with fu-
ture generations in perpetuity. 
I have taught my own children and grand-
children about the horrors of the Holocaust, 
just as my father taught me. I have taken 
my family to bear witness to the darkness at 
the Dachau concentration camp so that they 
could understand why we must always speak 
out against antisemitism and hatred in all of 
its pernicious forms. The legacy of the Holo-
caust must always remind us that silence in 
the face of such bigotry is complicity. 
Remembrance is our eternal duty, but re-
membrance without action risks becoming 
an empty ritual. As individuals, we must 
never be indifferent to human cruelty and 
human suffering. As nations, we must stand 
together across the international commu-
nity against antisemitism, which is once 
again rearing its ugly head around the world. 
We must combat other forms of hatred and 
educate new generations about the Holo-
caust. We must reject those who try to deny 
the Holocaust or to distort its history for 
their own ends. We recognize that, just as 
the Holocaust was an act of pure anti-
semitism, so too Holocaust denial is a form 
of antisemitism. We watch with dismay as 
the term ‘‘Nazi’’ is deployed to make flawed 
historical parallels. Efforts to minimize, dis-
tort, or blur who the Nazis were and the 
genocide they perpetrated are a form of Hol-
ocaust denial and, in addition to insulting 
both the victims and survivors of the Holo-
caust, spread antisemitism. 
My Administration has stepped up our ef-
forts to counter all the ugly forms anti-
semitism can take, including Holocaust de-
nial and distortion. We co-sponsored a 
United Nations resolution that charged the 
international community with combating 
Holocaust denial through education. We are 
partnering with the German government to 
improve Holocaust education and counter 
Holocaust denial and distortion. A renowned 
scholar of the Holocaust and antisemitism, 
Deborah Lipstadt, was recently confirmed as 
Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-
semitism. 
In addition to speaking out against the 
evils of antisemitism, I signed—and my Ad-
ministration continues to implement—legis-
lation that gives us more tools to combat 
crimes that are based on a victim’s actual or 
perceived race, religion, national origin, sex-
ual orientation, gender, gender identity or 
disability. We issued the first-ever National 
Strategy 
for 
Countering 
Domestic 
Ter-
rorism. My Administration has implemented 
increased funding for a program that helps 
threatened nonprofits—including houses of 
worship and other religious affiliated enti-
ties—to improve their safety and security. 
On International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day, I met with Bronia Brandman and the 
Vice President met with Ruth Cohen—both 
Auschwitz survivors—at the White House so 
we could bear witness to their stories, com-
bat Holocaust denial and distortion, and give 
life to the lessons of that most terrible pe-
riod in human history. 
Those like Bronia and Ruth who survived 
the Holocaust and went on to build new lives 
inspire our Nation and the world, and they 
are living testaments to the enduring resil-
ience of the human spirit. It is the responsi-
bility of all of us to recognize the pain that 
they carry and to support them by ensuring 
that the cruelty of the Holocaust is never 
forgotten. Today and every day, we stand 
against antisemitism and all other forms of 
hate and continue our work to ensure that 
everyone can live in a world that safeguards 
the fundamental human dignity of all peo-
ple. 
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., 
President of the United States of America, 
by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
the Constitution and the laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through 
May 1, 2022, as a week of observance of the 
Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Hol-
ocaust, and call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this week and pause 
to remember victims and survivors of the 
Holocaust. 
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my 
hand this twenty-second day of April, in the 
year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, 
and of the Independence of the United States 
of America the two hundred and forty-sixth. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to place in the RECORD a 
statement from Speaker PELOSI styled, 
‘‘Pelosi Statement on Holocaust Re-
membrance Day.’’ Among the many 
things said that I agree with is this 
statement: ‘‘This occasion serves as a 
reminder of the profound danger posed 
by hateful violence when met with in-
difference.’’ Hateful violence when met 
with indifference. 
PELOSI STATEMENT ON HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY 
‘‘On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we 
pause to reflect on the unfathomable evils of 
the Shoah. As we mourn the six million Jews 
and countless others murdered across Eu-
rope, we also honor the survivors who have 
bravely shared their stories so that such 
atrocities may never be repeated. More than 
seven decades later, we remain outraged by 
the Nazis’ barbaric crimes and unwavering in 
our commitment to fulfilling humanity’s sa-
cred promise: Never Again. 
‘‘This occasion serves as a reminder of the 
profound danger posed by hateful violence 
when met with indifference. In 2020, I had the 
solemn privilege of leading a Congressional 
delegation to Poland and Israel to com-
memorate the 75th anniversary of the libera-
tion of Auschwitz, bearing witness to hate’s 
destructive consequences. The epidemic of 
antisemitism still remains today, threat-
ening Jewish communities both at home and 
around the world. Shadows of these same 
dark forces have reached into more commu-
nities, from the surge of bigoted violence 
across the country to crimes against human-
ity 
being 
perpetrated 
abroad, 
including 
against Ukraine. 
‘‘Our nation must never fail to call out and 
defeat these perilous threats wherever and 
whenever they arise. In 1943, my father 
Thomas D’Alesandro appealed to ‘the Amer-
ican sense of justice and decency’ as he im-
plored the Roosevelt Administration to take 
action against the horrors of the Holocaust. 
Today, driven by those fundamental Amer-
ican values, the Congress is working to pre-
serve our collective memories of the past, 
educate the next generation and speak out 
against all of hate’s vile manifestations. 
Congressional action has helped forge a 
safer, more just society: from combating 
antisemitism by strengthening Holocaust 
education resources and establishing Con-
gressionally mandated Days of Remem-
brance to fighting hate-fueled violence by 
enacting the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act and 
the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. 
Today, joining with House colleagues to 
honor those murdered in the Shoah, I re-
called the moving words inscribed on San 
Francisco’s Holocaust Memorial: ‘In remem-
brance is the secret of redemption.’ Let us

reflect on that truth as we seek to find re-
demption in a future of dignity and justice 
for all. May we never forget the horrors in-
flicted on so many innocent souls, and may 
we never relent in our righteous fight to put 
an end to the scourge of hate.’’ 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise and desire that the statement 
from Majority Leader HOYER be ac-
knowledged. His statement is styled, 
‘‘Hoyer Statement on Holocaust Re-
membrance Day.’’ And I associate my-
self with many of the things in this 
statement, but the thing that I want to 
associate myself with the most are the 
final words in his statement: ‘‘Never 
Forget. Never Again.’’ I associate my-
self with his statement. 
HOYER STATEMENT ON HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY 
‘‘On Yom HaShoah, we remember the six 
million Jews and millions of others mur-
dered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The 
genocide perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and his 
fascist collaborators—and enabled by the in-
difference of millions of people in Germany 
and across Europe—continues to bear scars 
to this day, with the families of victims and 
survivors still living with immense trauma 
and grief. The Holocaust was not only an im-
measurable tragedy for the Jewish people; it 
was also a low point for humanity, when the 
worst evils of human hatred were unleashed 
in a way that was methodical and on an in-
dustrial scale in an effort to dehumanize and 
destroy an entire ethnic group. First by en-
acting degrading racial laws and forcing 
Jewish people to live in squalid ghettos and 
wear identifying marks for the purposes of 
ostracism and discrimination, and later 
through a systematic program of either de-
portation to labor and death camps or the 
massacre of entire communities by mobile 
killing squads, the Nazis taught the world a 
lesson on what happens when antisemitism 
and other forms of racism and bigotry are al-
lowed to fester unchecked and are taken to 
their extreme. Every human being who in-
habits our planet has a responsibility to 
learn the lessons of the Holocaust because it 
is a warning to all of humanity. ‘Never 
Again!’ must be a promise kept by all. ‘‘Ter-
rifyingly, however, we are now seeing in our 
day a dangerous rise in violent antisemitism 
here at home and around the world. Extrem-
ists of all kinds have revived Nazi tropes, 
and too many make light of Adolf Hitler and 
the reality of his crimes against humanity. 
There ought to be no celebration or even 
condoning of him or those who helped him 
perpetrate the Holocaust. At the same time, 
some have chosen to invoke the Holocaust 
flippantly when engaging in debates about 
policy, which is not only deeply inappro-
priate but also insulting to its victims, its 
survivors, and their families. In much the 
same vein, the misuse of the Holocaust and 
Nazism by Vladimir Putin in an attempt to 
justify his unjustifiable and criminal inva-
sion of Ukraine—as well as the disgusting 
misuse of the Holocaust to criticize the Jew-
ish State of Israel, a democracy based in 
human rights and the rule of law—is a cyn-
ical and disturbing effort to twist history up-
side down. Together, all who support truth 
and cherish human rights and human dignity 
must oppose such statements and efforts. 
‘‘The Nazis tried to destroy the Jewish 
people, but their resilience, defiance, and 
heroism—and the sacrifices of so many brave 
American servicemembers who were lib-
erators and rescuers—overcame Hitler’s evil 
plans. Today, the success and vibrancy of the 
State of Israel and the flourishing of Jewish 
communities in America and around the 
world is a living testament to Nazism’s de-
feat and to the triumph of justice. I’m proud 
to be the Majority Leader in a House that af-
firms, again and again, that antisemitism 
has no place in our country or in our poli-
tics—and to continue serving as a leader in 
the broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress 
ensuring that our ally Israel remains safe 
and strong and that America and Israel can 
be successful together in rooting out hatred, 
injustice, and antisemitism on Earth. ‘‘Never 
Forget. Never Again.’’ 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I have Jewish friends, as I believe 
most people do, and I have spoken to 
them about the horrors of the Holo-
caust. I have been to Israel, and I have 
been to Yad Vashem. I assure you, a 
visit to Yad Vashem can become a sem-
inal moment in your life because of 
what it shows with clarity about the 
horrors of the Holocaust. 
I am so proud that our leadership has 
gone on record in remembrance, and I 
am proud that this Congress passed a 
resolution signed by President Carter 
initially for days of remembrance. 
f 
NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of National Day of 
Prayer next week on May 5. 
The United States has always been a 
Nation of prayer. From our very first 
settlers to our Founding Fathers, our 
leaders have understood the power of 
prayer and have consistently called the 
Nation to prayer during times of con-
sequence, adversity, conflict, and cri-
sis. 
Since the first call to prayer in 1775, 
when the Continental Congress asked 
the colonists to pray for wisdom as 
they worked to form a Nation, the call 
to prayer has continued throughout 
our history. 
First officially established by an act 
of Congress and signed into law by 
President Harry S. Truman in 1952, the 
National Day of Prayer is a vital part 
of our country’s heritage, and prayers 
remain very important in strength-
ening the fabric of our society today. 
I would venture to say that 90 per-
cent of our country’s challenges—ev-
erything from drug addiction, to sui-
cides, to infidelity, to the breakdown of 
the family, to fraud, to the coarseness 
and vulgarity of the language we see 
every day on television and witness in 
our communities, and even political di-
visiveness—all are a direct result of a 
moral and spiritual decline that can 
only be reversed by our willingness to 
come before God, acknowledge our sin-
ful nature, and turn our hearts back to 
Him. 
Only then will healing begin and divi-
sions subside. For the hubris of sin dis-
torts our views of truth and creates di-
visions even among those with whom 
we agree most of the time. 
Our Founding Fathers understood the 
sinful nature of man. That is, in fact, 
why they devised a government de-
signed to disperse power by creating 
three equal branches. Even the U.S. 
Congress—which 
is 
one 
of 
those 
branches—the legislative branch, has 
two very different bodies with different 
rules and different aims to help ensure 
that the minority voice is not tram-
pled, and that it is at least heard if it 
cannot be accommodated. 
b 1015 
Now, many ask me when we are 
going to fix Washington. My reply is 
always this: When we fix our home life; 
when we fix our churches; when we fix 
our communities, Washington will fix 
itself. 
Those of us who have the honor of 
serving in Congress are, after all, a re-
flection of our constituency, as de-
signed by our Founders. And, therefore, 
the two bodies of Congress are no more 
and no less than a microcosm of soci-
ety. 
So, on the National Day of Prayer, 
let us all join in prayer for our fami-
lies, our communities, our State, and 
our Nation. May we pray for forgive-
ness, to seek the face of God and to 
turn from our inherently sinful ways. 
For when we do, we will hear, we will 
learn, 
we 
will 
communicate, 
and 
unhealthy traps of division of all 
stripes will fall away. 
Through the power of prayer, we will 
achieve a renewing of our mind, a re-
newing of our commitment to that 
which is honorable and virtuous, a re-
newing of the family, our societal 
structure, and a renewing of this great 
Nation we call the United States of 
America, the greatest lamp of liberty 
and beacon of freedom, prosperity, and 
generosity ever known to mankind

RECOGNIZING GAVIN 
CHRISTOPHER DEAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Gavin Christopher Deal, a 
native of Alexander County in the 
Fifth District. 
Gavin has served over a decade in the 
military and is currently a Surface to 
Air Ballistic Missile Specialist on the 
USS Fitzgerald. 
Recently, he joined 12 other Petty Of-
ficers in representing the United States 
in the Milan 2022 Multinational Naval 
Exercise, and the International City 
Parade. 
He also successfully launched two 
harpoon ballistic missiles in the pre-
vious war games near the Philippines. 
These are terrific accomplishments in-
deed. 
Gavin, thank you for your continued 
service to both North Carolina’s Fifth 
District and our great country. You are 
a shining example of the best that the 
Fifth District has to offer. 
RECOGNIZING MAURA SCHAFFER-GREER 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to

coach, and percussion instructor at 
South Caldwell High School. As you 
can tell, she is a true renaissance 
woman. 
Recently, her class participated in a 
project where class members wrote let-
ters to me about different pieces of leg-
islation and asked for my thoughts. In 
doing so, her students learned a truly 
invaluable lesson: becoming an in-
formed citizen is one of the most im-
portant duties we have as Americans. 
Madam Speaker, after talking with 
Mrs. Schaffer-Greer and learning about 
her love of teaching, it is clear to me 
that she leaves an indelible mark on 
the lives of her students. May she con-
tinue to do so for many years in the fu-
ture. 
OUTHERN BORDER CATASTROPHE CONTINUES 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, our 
southern border is under siege and 
President Biden is asleep at the wheel. 
Over 40 illegal aliens on the terror 
watch list have been arrested at the 
southern border since President Biden 
took office. 
In March of this year, 220,000 illegal 
aliens were encountered at the south-
ern border, and 62,000 of them evaded 
Border Patrol agents. 
Madam Speaker, that averages out to 
roughly 2,000 people per day escaping 
into our country. 
So who did Border Patrol agents not 
catch? Who else is on the terror watch 
list that escaped into our country? 
Madam Speaker, border security is 
national security, and it is clear that 
this administration fails to recognize 
that most basic fact and do its duty.

NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS 
MONTH

Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise

tism Awareness Month, which we honor 
in April each year. 
Madam Speaker, 1 in 44 children in 
the United States are diagnosed with 
autism spectrum disorder. The preva-
lence of autism spectrum disorder has 
increased 16.3 percent since the year 
2000, making it even more important to 
expand research and provide adequate 
resources for people who are on the 
spectrum. By increasing awareness, we 
can support the more than 5.4 million 
individuals in America living with au-
tism spectrum disorder. 
Our early childcare programs, espe-
cially in schools, must have the knowl-
edge, resources, and ability to provide 
assistance to those living with autism. 
Early diagnosis and treatment can 
make all the difference. 
I will take a moment to recognize my 
dear friend, Vincent McLaughlin, of 
Saugerties, New York, who truly is an 
inspiration to me and to all of us who 
are standing there trying to help the 
cause of autism awareness. 
Vincent is an active and dedicated 
member of his community with full- 
time employment and doing volunteer 
work for the fire department and nu-
merous other not-for-profit agencies in 
his community. He constantly strives 
for increased awareness for autism 
through his selfless service and tena-
cious advocacy. 
Vincent is a shining example of how 
effective and beneficial early treat-
ment and community empowerment 
can be for people with autism spectrum 
disorder. 
It is a privilege today to acknowledge 
April as Autism Awareness Month. 
May all Americans living with autism 
receive the tools, resources, and sup-
port necessary to live fulfilling lives. 
Autism should never be a barrier pre-
venting Americans from achieving suc-
cess or pursuing happiness. 
Good luck to all of them, and espe-
cially 
my 
dear 
friend, 
Vincent 
McLaughlin. Thank you so much for 
keeping me aware and for inspiring all 
of us.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SPECIALIST BISHOP EVANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
and recognize Texas National Guard 
Specialist Bishop Evans. Bishop Evans 
is a hero. He is a name that we all 
should learn, should know, and should 
be speaking. 
Bishop Evans, this young gentleman, 
was a National Guardsman. He was sta-
tioned in Eagle Pass, Texas. He self-
lessly gave his life trying to save peo-
ple. He didn’t care what nationality 
they were. He didn’t care the cir-
cumstances. 
When the situation arose and two 
people fell or jumped into the river, he 
immediately took off his body armor. 
He immediately jumped into the river, 
and he tried to save these people, and 
he lost his life doing it. 
This is something that here in D.C. 
we should be talking about. The whole 
country should be talking about Spe-
cialist Bishop Evans. The man is a 
hero. 
There are many men and women that 
serve that are just like this, that when 
the time comes, it is a fight-or-flight 
moment and they are rushing to the 
fire; they are not running away from 
it. 
I give my condolences to Specialist 
Evans, his grandparents, Jo Ann and 
Dannie Johnson, in Arlington, Texas. 
Their grandson meant everything to 
them, and they are going to have a fu-
neral this weekend. 
I celebrate this man’s life. I celebrate 
what he stands for. I celebrate every-
thing that he has done. He is a patriot. 
He served our country. He served in 
Kuwait. He served in Iraq. 
This man, when duty called, he an-
swered the call. And here he was, sta-
tioned in Eagle Pass, Texas, in my dis-
trict, in Texas 23, and he jumped into 
the river. He didn’t have to do that. He 
lost his life doing that. 
This border crisis has impacted ev-
erybody, all parts, all walks of life, 
Texas. Every State in America has be-
come sucked up into this crisis, and 
this gentleman here gave his life. He is 
a hero that we all should remember. 
Bishop Evans is a hero that we should 
all remember. 
Please say a prayer for his family. I 
was raised by my grandparents. He was 
raised by his grandparents. Not all 
families are traditional families, per 
se. And his grandparents, they lost a 
part of them when they lost Specialist 
Bishop Evans.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF ELLA 
AND OWEN ROGERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BUSTOS). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. 
MACE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize and commend two of 
my young constituents from Daniel Is-
land, South Carolina, Ella and Owen 
Rogers—Ella is 14 and Owen is 17—and 
their efforts in support of Ukraine and 
standing in solidarity with the Ukrain-
ian people during one of the toughest 
times in Ukraine’s history. 
They are both descendants of their 
great-great-grandfather, Joseph, who 
was born in Galicia, Ukraine. Joseph 
was forced to flee to the United States 
during the early 20th century due to 
the armed conflict between Austrian 
and Russian Empires trying to occupy 
the region. 
The story of their family history 
shows similarities to what the world 
has witnessed in the last few months 
during the beginning of the uncon-
scionable 
and 
illegal 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine by Russian forces in late Feb-
ruary. 
As Ella and Owen Rogers have wit-
nessed these atrocities, as my teenage 
kids who are very similar in age, these 
kids have seen these atrocities; have 
witnessed these war crimes. They have 
seen it all over social media and tele-
vision. 
But they have spoken with their 
uncle recently who had been providing 
humanitarian and military intelligence 
aid in Warsaw, Poland at the time, and 
they decided the best way to make a 
difference was through providing nour-
ishment to mothers and children who 
are fleeing their home country of 
Ukraine. 
I was recently in Warsaw and in Po-
land a few weeks ago witnessing the 
women and children fleeing Ukraine 
and coming into the country. There are 
millions 
of 
families, 
particularly 
women and kids, who have been dis-
placed because their fathers and hus-
bands and partners are staying back 
home in Ukraine to fight this war. 
But they rallied their relatives, their 
friends, their neighbors, the amazing 
community of Daniel Island in the

Lowcountry. Ella and Owen have raised 
over $7,000 for the World Central Kitch-
en, which is an organization that pro-
vides food and nourishment to commu-
nities around the world in times of con-
flict, crisis, and war. 
Ella and Owen are just one example 
of the type of compassion and empathy 
that we see each and every day in the 
Lowcountry. The great people of the 
Lowcountry show, not only to their fel-
low citizens, the State of South Caro-
lina, our Nation, and around the world, 
there are no strangers they have ever 
met, and everyone is witnessing great 
hope for the future of Ukraine. 
I hope that the story of Ella and 
Owen can serve as an inspiration to 
others who stand up for what is right, 
even when it seems like there is noth-
ing that can be done in the face of 
hardship. They have shown hard work; 
they have shown that we need to do the 
right thing; and they have shown peo-
ple that they care. 
And now, more than ever, it is impor-
tant that we do all we can to support 
our friends in Ukraine to help them 
during this critical crisis. 
I again thank the Rogers family and 
the incredible work ethic that Ella and 
Owen have shown the Lowcountry and 
the State of South Carolina.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BOBBY BERKSTRESSER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the 
life and legacy of a good friend and 
Rockbridge County resident, Bobby 
Berkstresser, 
who 
recently 
passed 
away at the age of 71. 
Bobby was truly a kind soul who had 
a passion for both people and business. 
In 1981, he purchased his first business, 
Lee Hi Travel Plaza, in Lexington. At 
the time, he had only eight employees 
on payroll, but over the years he grew 
it exponentially and was able to ex-
pand. 
When Bobby passed, he employed 
more than 400 people, and his second 
business, White’s Travel Center in 
Raphine was the largest east of the 
Mississippi, a fact of which he was defi-
nitely proud. 
He brought honor and pride to the job 
and, in 2018, he was honored with the 
NATSO Hall of Fame Award for his 
contributions to the industry. 
His employees say, ‘‘He was not only 
your boss, he encouraged you, and he 
was family to a lot of people.’’ That 
was certainly how everyone felt about 
Bobby Berkstresser. 
Aside from owning White’s and Lee 
Hi, Bobby was deeply committed to his 
community. He regularly contributed 
to local nonprofits, in addition to serv-
ing on several boards, including the 
Bank of Botetourt, Rockbridge YMCA, 
Rockbridge United Way, Rockbridge 
County Board of Supervisors, former 
Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hospital, 
RALS, Rockbridge Republican Com-
mittee, and NATSO. 
Madam Speaker, it goes without say-
ing that Rockbridge County lost a 
giant. His passing will be felt by this 
community for quite some time, and 
my thoughts and prayers remain with 
his wife, Sue, and his beloved family.

REJECTING THE BIDEN BUDGET 
Mr. 
CLINE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
Americans face the worst rate of infla-
tion in 41 years, President Biden’s pro-
posed budget does nothing to help ease 
the burden on our country’s struggling 
families. 
Despite experts predicting that a re-
cession is coming, the President’s pro-
posed budget would further exacerbate 
high inflation by spending $73 trillion 
over the next decade and would be 
funded by the highest sustained tax 
burden in our Nation’s history. 
As Americans pay record prices at 
the 
pump, 
this 
budget 
proposal 
prioritizes radical Green New Deal en-
ergy policies and continues Biden’s de-
struction of American energy inde-
pendence with increased taxes on the 
oil and gas industry. 
Who is going to feel those increased 
taxes? Working men and women in the 
Sixth District of Virginia and across 
this country. Further, it pushes unnec-
essary and already rejected Build Back 
Better social programs and provides 
benefits to illegal aliens, which is en-
tirely unacceptable. 
For my constituents in the Sixth 
District, I will continue to hold Biden 
administration 
officials 
accountable 
and demand justifications for this 
spending spree that is this budget when 
they come before the committees on 
which I serve. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in strong op-
position to the President’s proposal, 
and I urge its rejection should it come 
before this House. 
f 
INVESTING IN SUCCESS OF 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, the America COM-
PETES Act of 2022 includes bold, 
smart, and strategic investments to 
power the success of America’s work-
ers, businesses, and economy based on 
bipartisan bills, many of which have al-
ready passed the House with bipartisan 
support. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
for 
generations, 
America’s innovation, from electricity 
to automobiles, robotics, and plastics, 
has shaped the course of history. We 
prevail because of our early invest-
ments in science, research, and tech-
nology. 
But today, America’s preeminence is 
being challenged. Other countries have 
followed our lead in research, science, 
and technology. As a result, more of 
the technology that we are relying on 
today is made abroad, driving up the 
cost in the United States, contributing 
to inflation, threatening our workers’ 
financial security and their jobs, and 
eroding our Nation’s competitiveness. 
The House’s America COMPETES 
Act is precisely what is needed to en-
sure America’s might in manufacturing 
and innovation while creating good- 
paying jobs and lowering costs for our 
Nation. 
Our bill brings American manufac-
turing back to our shores, including $52 
billion for chips, which are crucial for 
making cars, cell phones, and more. 
Our bill will help reinvigorate Amer-
ica’s industries, securing $45 billion to 
strengthen our supply chain and reduce 
dependence on foreign nations and low-
ering costs. 
Our bill will invest in research and 
education so that we diversify our 
STEM workforce with apprenticeships. 
Our bill will promote U.S. global 
leadership. 
These are investments that all Amer-
icans need so desperately in order to 
obtain prosperity. 
My colleagues and I look forward to 
swiftly going to conference with the 
Senate so we can put forth a strong bill 
that will help all Americans and put it 
on the President’s desk to sign.

REAUTHORIZING THE FARM BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the 
eighth installment of my farm bill im-
pact series, where I am highlighting 
various aspects of the farm bill that de-
serve Congress’ awareness and support. 
The food aid programs within the 
farm bill not only support the nutri-
tion of millions of Americans strug-
gling with hunger, but they also help 
to stop global conflicts before they 
start. 
Kansas is the Wheat State, and 
wheat is the number one commodity 
used in U.S. donations for inter-
national food aid. If you combine all 
the aid destinations, they amount to a 
top 10 market for U.S. wheat. 
The last two farm bills have granted 
USAID flexibility in implementing aid 
programs, which has resulted in the 
U.S. purchasing from other countries 
more than half of the total food we 
give out. 
That is a noble thing to use our re-
sources to help hungry people overseas, 
but our government should prioritize 
the commodities of American farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural producers as 
we carry out this good work abroad. 
International food assistance pro-
grams work alongside legislation to 
help stabilize countries ravaged by 
famine and war, reduce terrorism, and 
give people an alternative from fleeing 
their homeland just to find food. 
For instance, I introduced a resolu-
tion condemning and prohibiting the

use of hunger as a weapon, which some 
bad actors do in countries suffering 
from war and natural disasters. Food 
aid programs work alongside the legis-
lation to avert food shortages in such 
countries, making it more difficult for 
anyone to use hunger as a weapon in 
the first place. 
The farm bill has some excellent pro-
grams for international food assistance 
that I believe should be reauthorized. 
The 
Bill 
Emerson 
Humanitarian 
Trust is a special authority in the 2018 
farm bill that allows USAID’s Bureau 
for Humanitarian Assistance to re-
spond to unanticipated food crises 
abroad. I just sent a bipartisan letter 
earlier this month asking the Presi-
dent to release BEHT. 
Food for Peace is another great pro-
gram through which our country re-
sponds to humanitarian crises and food 
security problems globally. The idea 
for this program actually came from a 
meeting of the Southwest Kansas Farm 
Bureau and first appeared in 1954 when 
President Eisenhower signed the Agri-
culture Trade Development and Assist-
ance Act into law. 
Today, USDA and USAID partner 
with organizations to implement Food 
for Peace and other food aid programs, 
stopping global conflicts from esca-
lating into humanitarian disasters. 
The 
McGovern-Dole 
International 
Food for Education and Child Nutrition 
Program, named in part for Kansas’ 
own Bob Dole, helps support education, 
child development, and food security in 
low-income, 
food-deficit 
countries 
around the globe. The program pro-
vides for the donation of U.S. agricul-
tural commodities, as well as financial 
and technical assistance to support 
school meal programs as well as mater-
nal and child nutrition programs. 
I supported this program in fiscal 
year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 appropria-
tions because it has a proven track 
record for reducing hunger, improving 
literacy in children, and helping pro-
vide nutrition for pregnant and nursing 
mothers, infants, and preschoolers. 
Earlier this month, Nicole Berg, 
president of the National Association 
of Wheat Growers, spoke to the House 
Agriculture 
Committee’s 
Livestock 
and 
Foreign 
Agriculture 
Sub-
committee. In her testimony, she gave 
us her eyewitness account, from her 
2019 trip to Kenya and Tanzania, of how 
international 
food 
assistance 
helps 
those people in most need. 
She visited refugee camps where the 
World Food Programme is feeding 98 
percent of the 200,000 people there who 
hail from nine countries. She said that 
witnessing U.S. food shipments saving 
lives firsthand changed her life. 
I want to make sure that, going for-
ward, we use U.S. commodities while 
we carry out this good work abroad. If 
America is going to conduct inter-
national food assistance in an effective 
way, the Biden administration is going 
to have to get a grip on the agricul-
tural impact of its trade and foreign 
policies. 
Sadly, on an international scale, the 
Biden administration is turning a blind 
eye to agriculture. Russia’s assault on 
Ukraine is one of the most horrifying 
humanitarian crises in recent memory, 
and it has grave food security implica-
tions for Europe. 
Ukraine is known as the breadbasket 
of Europe. It is the third-largest grain 
exporter in the world. You would think 
this administration would want a point 
person to develop a strategy for ad-
dressing this looming problem, but 
President Biden still hasn’t appointed 
either a USDA Under Secretary for 
Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs 
or a Chief Agricultural Negotiator for 
USTR. 
The Biden administration has also 
sat back and done nothing to hold 
China accountable for stiffing Amer-
ican farmers out of $16 billion in the 
Phase One trade deal, and the Presi-
dent left agriculture out of his Indo- 
Pacific strategy entirely. 
I, along with American farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural producers, 
am appalled at this shortsightedness. 
You cannot take food for granted, 
which is why the Biden administration 
needs to wake up and why Congress 
must think carefully about the reau-
thorization of the international food 
assistance programs in the farm bill. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series. America’s farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural producers 
are American heroes who are bearing 
the responsibility of feeding hungry 
people around the world. 
Their efforts deserve the full support 
of Congress because the food security 
and, therefore, the national security of 
America hangs in the balance.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
O Lord, our God, on this Holocaust 
Remembrance Day, we remember. 
We remember the 6 million lives of 
Jewish men, women, and children, and 
the millions of others whose very being 
was arbitrarily deemed a disgrace, and 
whose light among us was extin-
guished. Now they, like the heavens, 
have no speech, nor are there words, 
their voice is not heard. And yet, their 
cries resound to the ends of the Earth. 
Remind us again that each life is sa-
cred; Yours is the breath held in the 
soul of each person. 
We remember that it only took one 
person to fuel a horrendous movement 
of hatred, abuse, and genocide. Though 
one person, there were countless others 
who would not speak out against the 
seduction of power or stand up to the 
sway of control. 
Holy God, remind us that this mur-
derous evil still roams the Earth this 
day. Convict us who remain silent and 
shield our eyes from the raging fire of 
inhumanity. 
Then inspire us from remembrance to 
action, from indifference to indigna-
tion, from silence to speech. Then may 
the words of our mouths be effective in 
Your sight, the meditations of our 
hearts be worthy of Your blessing, that 
never again would we allow the catas-
trophe of the Holocaust to touch Your 
children. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

And Dennis from Downingtown had

on top of other expenses. 
Our communities deserve support in 
facing these challenges, and it is vital 
that we do everything that we can to 
confront them. I helped establish an In-

HONORING THE WEATHER 
CHANNEL’S 40TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, 40 years 
ago, live from Atlanta, Georgia, house-
holds across America were introduced 
to The Weather Channel. For the first 
time, Americans could get safe, reli-
able, trustworthy information about 
the weather 24 hours a day. 
Since its first broadcast, The Weath-
er Channel has done far more than just 
provide up-to-date information about 
weather forecasts. With the help of 
friendly, familiar faces, The Weather 
Channel’s reporting has inspired count-
less young people to wonder and care 
about the natural world around them, 
motivating them to study weather and 
our climate. And through their con-
stant innovation, The Weather Chan-
nel’s award-winning breakthroughs in 
weather reporting have undoubtedly 
saved countless American lives. 
I am proud to lead a House Resolu-
tion with my colleague from Georgia, 
Congressman 
LOUDERMILK,

com-
memorate the anniversary; and I wish 
The Weather Channel continued suc-
cess as they document and broadcast

Year 2021, Customs and Border Patrol 
seized 11,000 pounds of fentanyl at our 
southern border. During the same pe-
riod, opioid deaths jumped to 75,000, up 
from 56,000 deaths the prior year. 
This is no coincidence. Even in a 
hearing on combating the opioid crisis 
this week, not a single one of my 
Democratic colleagues called for Presi-
dent Biden to end his open border poli-
cies that have allowed the free flow of 
fentanyl or other illicit drugs into the 
United States. 
During the hearing, the former Act-
ing DEA Administrator testified that 
securing the border is a commonsense 
approach to stopping drug traffickers 
and giving power back to our law en-
forcement. 
On one hand, Washington Democrats 
say they want to solve the opioid cri-
sis. On the other hand, they are sup-
porting policies and politicians that 
have left our border open. 
Washington Democrats need to get 
serious. If we want to solve this opioid 
crisis, we must secure the border and 
restore law and order.

MARKING BIRTHDAY OF THE 11TH 
PANCHEN LAMA 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, we mark the 33rd birthday of 
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Pan-
chen Lama. Born in central Tibet, at 
the age of six he was recognized by His 
Holiness the Dalai Lama as the rein-
carnation of the Panchen Lama, one of 
the most important figures in the 
Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism, and 
a senior figure across all of Tibet. 
In May of 1995, just 3 days after he 
was 
recognized, 
Gedhun 
Choekyi 
Nyima and his family were taken away 
by 
the 
Chinese 
Government. 
Dis-
appeared. Kidnapped. 
For 27 years, Tibetan Buddhists have 
asked of his well-being. For 27 years, 
Chinese authorities have refused to 
provide proof of life. The most they 
have said is that he is well and wants 
to be left alone. 
Tibetans deserve an answer. The 
world deserves to know. 
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima remains one 
of the world’s longest-held prisoners of 
conscience. 
His enforced disappearance is an 
egregious example of the Chinese Gov-
ernment’s violation of the religious 
freedom of Tibetan Buddhists, who 
have the right to choose their own reli-
gious 
leaders, 
including 
the 
Dalai 
Lama, 
without 
government 
inter-
ference. 
In honor of his birthday, I again call 
on the Chinese Government to free the 
true Panchen Lama immediately and 
to uphold its international obligation 
to respect the religious freedom of all 
persons.

WELCOMING GEORGIAN 
PRESIDENT ZOURABICHVILI 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, Washington wel-
comed President Salome Zourabichvili, 
of the Republic of Georgia, who had 
come to attend the funeral of former 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
During an interview with The Wash-
ington Post, President Zourabichvili 
explained that, along with Ukraine, 
Georgia and Moldova were the two 
countries closest to Russia wanting to 
join NATO and the European Union, 
but not protected by either. ‘‘Georgia 
should not be forgotten’’ and if so, they 
might be a temptation for the Russian 
leadership. 
President 
Zourabichvili 
reviewed 
that Georgia also had a history of war 
with Russia, most recently in 2008, as 
well as 1991, shortly after declaring 
independence. 
It is reassuring, the President said, 
the Georgian population is 100 percent 
united in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. Americans are also united for 
the independence of Georgia, Moldova, 
led by President Maia Sandu, and 
Ukraine.

COMMEMORATING THE 107TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
ARMENIAN 
GENOCIDE 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 107th anni-
versary of the Armenian genocide. 
On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Em-
pire embarked on a genocidal campaign 
to wipe out more than 1.5 million inno-
cent Armenians. For too long, the 
world denied the Armenians’ plight. 
But thankfully, leaders like President 
Biden and this House of Representative 
have recognized the Armenian genocide 
for the tragedy that we all know to be 
true. 
My home State of Rhode Island 
boasts one of the largest Armenian 
communities in the country, and I have 
been proud to represent them for the 
last 22 years. 
Yet, as Winston Churchill famously 
said, ‘‘Those who fail to learn from his-
tory are condemned to repeat it.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, another genocide is un-
folding before our eyes in Ukraine. The 
scenes from Bucha, Mariupol, and the 
villages across the country are heart-
breaking and haunting. But like the 
Armenian 
people, 
Ukrainians 
are 
strong, and they have shown their un-
matched bravery to the world. 
I strongly reiterate my harsh con-
demnation of Vladimir Putin’s war 
crimes. We must do all that we can to 
support the Ukrainian people in their 
battle for freedom. The consequences 
of failure are far too dreadful to imag-
ine.

ADMINISTRATION MUST SECURE 
BORDER 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, every day, 
we see more and more illegal crossings 
at the southern border. March was the 
worst month yet, with over 221,000 mi-
grant encounters. 
Instead of securing our border and 
empowering law enforcement, this ad-
ministration continues to make this 
crisis worse every day. 
I am a proud immigrant and first- 
generation American. I came here le-
gally. There are 4.4 million people 
waiting their turn to legally come to 
the greatest country in the whole 
world. Meanwhile, this administration 
continues to allow millions of illegal 
migrants to take advantage of our 
weak border policies. 
We are a nation of laws, and enough 
is enough. The administration must 
stop the flow of drugs and crime into 
our country and secure the border to 
protect our citizens. 
f 
CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
RIVER ROUGE, MICHIGAN 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the city of River 
Rouge, Michigan, as they celebrate a 
100-year anniversary. 
Established as a city on April 3, 1922, 
River Rouge is a rich part of Michi-
gan’s history. It is situated between 
the Detroit and Rouge Rivers. The city 
of River Rouge has been the heart of 
Michigan’s industrial and manufac-
turing history. 
Nearly 8,000 residents strong, the city 
of River Rouge takes pride in its role 
as being an integral part of Michigan’s 
economy. They are the jewel of Michi-
gan’s downriver communities. 
It continues to thrive as a diverse, vi-
brant, and welcoming community that 
I truly love. 
Its public parks and access to river 
recreation offer unique opportunities 
for enjoying nature and spotting wild-
life along the riverfronts. 
Please join me in recognizing the 
city of River Rouge as we join them in 
celebrating its 100-year anniversary. 
Again, I am beyond proud of serving 
this beautiful city of River Rouge and 
its residents in Michigan’s 13th Dis-
trict Strong.

HONORING THE SULLIVAN 
BROTHERS 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the five Sullivan broth-
ers of Waterloo, Iowa, as well as those 
who are working to preserve their leg-
acy by saving the USS The Sullivans. 
On January 3, 1942, a month after the 
bombing at Pearl Harbor, George, 
Frank, Joe, Matt, and Al Sullivan of 
Waterloo, Iowa, enlisted in the Navy. 
At the time, Navy policy separated 
brothers, but they enlisted under the 
condition that they could serve their 
country together, and they did until 
November of that year when a Japa-
nese torpedo sunk their ship, the USS 
Juneau. 
Nearly all the sailors aboard the USS 
Juneau died, including all five of the 
Sullivan brothers. 
The Sullivans weren’t just heroes in 
Iowa; their story was told nationwide. 
In 1943, less than 3 months after their 
passing, a Fletcher-class destroyer was 
named in their honor. The ship’s motto 
is ‘‘We Stick Together,’’ a permanent 
symbol of the Sullivan brothers’ com-
mitment to each other and our coun-
try. 
But earlier this month, a leaky hull 
caused the ship to start sinking at its 
berth in the Buffalo Naval Park. So, 
Mr. Speaker, I am rising today to 
thank those who are working to refloat 
and repair the ship to ensure that the 
Sullivan brothers’ legacy continues. 
Their service and sacrifice are emblem-
atic of the shared experience and patri-
otism of those in the Greatest Genera-
tion. 
Freedom is fragile. We know that we 
must always honor those like the Sul-
livan brothers of Waterloo who fought 
and died for our freedoms and for our 
country.

HONORING CONGRESSIONAL APP 
CHALLENGE WINNERS 
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, along with my colleague, Con-
gresswoman KIM, to honor the winners 
and participants of 2021’s Congressional 
App Challenge. 
Since the competition’s inception in 
2013, this official initiative has given 
middle and high school students from 
across the country the ability to par-
ticipate in a program designed to in-
spire them to pursue computer coding 
and careers in STEM. 
Congresswoman KIM and I have had 
the privilege of shepherding this year’s 
initiative, which yielded more than 
2,100 fully functioning apps from over 
7,000 students across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, 340 of our fellow Mem-
bers held challenges in districts span-
ning all 50 States, Puerto Rico, Guam, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C. 
As excited as we are about this year’s 
participation in the challenge in terms 
of sheer numbers, the program would 
not be possible without the students 
who invest their time and efforts into 
their passion projects. 
Congresswoman KIM and I are hon-
ored to co-chair this effort and offer 
our remarks here today as a testament 
to the dedication of these students who 
embody the future of American inge-
nuity. 
To all the winners of this year’s com-
petition, we offer our sincere gratitude 
and congratulations on your work.

Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the participants 
and winners of the 2021 Congressional

QUESTIONING REPUBLICAN 
LEADERSHIP 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, under the 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
passed 
by 
Democrats and signed by President 
Biden, more than 7.4 million jobs were 
created in the first 14 months of the 
Biden administration, the most in U.S. 
history. 
During that time, unemployment 
dropped to its lowest in over 50 years. 
Democrats are building a better Amer-
ica for the people. 
What are Republicans doing? I don’t 
know. But I do know that Republican 
Congresswoman 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR 
GREENE recently stated that the Catho-
lic Church is controlled by Satan. She 
has not yet apologized for her bigoted 
remark. 
Republican 
Congressman 
MADISON 
CAWTHORN tried to board a plane with a 
gun for a second time. What has Repub-
lican leadership done? Nothing. 
f 
DANGEROUS OPEN BORDER 
POLICIES 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the utter failure of 
President Biden’s dangerous open bor-
der policies. 
In March, there were over 221,000 ille-
gal encounters at our southern border, 
a 542 percent increase, bringing the 
total under Biden’s watch to more than 
2.4 million. Forty-two of those appre-
hended were on the terrorist watch 
list. This can’t happen. 
Illegal migrants are being dispersed 
into communities throughout country, 
making every State a border State, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Meanwhile, 
my 
constituent, 
an 
American citizen, has been told his 
wife and daughter, who have fled war- 
torn Ukraine, must wait up to 2 years 
outside the United States for a visa 
interview. 
This is wrong. These policies reward 
those who violate our laws and punish 
those trying to do the right thing. 
They also put law enforcement offi-
cers in serious peril, as evidenced by 
the death of Texas National Guards-
man Bishop Evans. May his memory be 
eternal. He tragically drowned last 
week while courageously working to 
save individuals trying to cross the Rio 
Grande River illegally. 
This insanity has to stop. 
f 
JUSTICE FOR THOMAS RAYNARD 
JAMES 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the 
recent freedom of Thomas Raynard 
James and the crucial work of his at-
torney, Natalie Figgers. 
One of the most paramount pillars of 
our legal system is the concept that ev-
eryone is innocent until proven guilty. 
But how does the system react when 
even those who are innocent are 
deemed guilty? This Wednesday, the 
Nation was able to witness the legal 
system right one of these wrongs. 
Thomas Raynard James was wrong-
fully convicted of murder and sen-
tenced to life due to a case of mistaken 
identity in 1991. His preliminary con-
viction was based on an eyewitness ac-
count. 
Three decades later, this wrongful 
conviction has been overturned based 
on revised testimony, new evidence, 
and lack of physical evidence. Due to 
persistence and faith in the legal sys-
tem, Ms. Figgers succeeded in freeing 
Mr. James, who was an innocent man. 
We applaud the work of his attorneys 
and all the leaders who continuously 
fight the good fight for justice to make 
sure that everyone has a chance at jus-
tice.

RECOGNIZING DENNIS JONES 
UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a great Kansan, Dennis Jones, 
on the occasion of his retirement. 
In 1982, Dennis moved from Colorado 
to Kansas to begin working at the 
Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Holcomb. 
He started out as an hourly employee 
on the harvest floor and worked his 
way up. Soon after proving himself to 
be knowledgeable and committed to his 
job, he moved up to the role of depart-
ment head. 
Dennis spent time at the Amarillo 
plant, learning about different depart-
ments and operations within the busi-
ness, after which he came back to Hol-
comb in 2006. He quickly became the 
new operations manager and then 
moved up again to his current role as 
complex plant manager. 
I love Dennis’ story because it exem-
plifies hard work, tenacity, looking for 
open doors, and staying committed to a 
calling that requires skill, intuition, 
attention to detail, and relationship- 
building. 
Dennis is the type of guy that em-
bodies grit, agriculture, and conserv-
ative Kansas values. 
On his last day at Tyson, Dennis 
plans to return his computer in the 
morning and then spend the rest of the 
day with the hourly employees on the 
harvest floor. 
This is a great man whose career and 
legacy I am proud to honor here today. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Dennis. 
f 
NATIONAL DAY OF SILENCE 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize those who partici-
pated in the National Day of Silence. 
This day allows students and allies to 
take a vow of silence as a way to speak 
out against any harassment and dis-
crimination experienced by LGBTQ 
people in our schools. 
In my district on the Central Coast 
of California, Luka Chavez, who at-
tends Watsonville School of Arts, took 
his vow last week. Luka told me that 
he wanted to take the vow so that he 
can make all the difference for all of 
those who don’t have a voice in our 
own community. 
Luka felt that his silence for 1 day 
was the least that he could do to speak 
up for those who feel isolated and ex-
cluded every day. 
Luka, you may have taken your vow 
last week, but this week, on this day, 
on this floor, your voice is not only 
heard but, more importantly, your 
message is received by teachers, coun-
selors, administrators, parents, and all 
who support you but also, most impor-
tantly, those who don’t. 
Luka, your vow of silence allows me 
to speak for you and inspires Congress 
to continue its fight for LGBTQ stu-
dents in our community and equal 
rights for our democracy.

YARMUTH). Members are reminded to

rise today to recognize The Weather

high-quality educational content. 
Since 1982, The Weather Channel has

from the mundane daily rain shower to 
catastrophic hurricanes and tornadoes. 
Today, The Weather Channel reaches

has received nationwide acclaim for its 
high-quality reporting and program-
ming.

disasters and severe weather events 
such as Hurricane Katrina, the 2011 tor-

ON 
TAKE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER 
TO WORK DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today is Take Your Son 
or Daughter to Work Day. While my 
three sons are grown, I have the privi-
lege of having a friend of mine, Seth 
Parish, with me today. 
Seth is 12 years old and hails from 
Maryland. He is actively involved in 
baseball, playing center outfield, ice 
hockey, and has recently joined the 
Civil Air Patrol where he learns about 
aerospace and survival skills. 
Our schedule is busy today as the 
House Agriculture Committee held a 
2022 farm bill review hearing. Seth 
joined me for that, and he is also join-
ing me for this speech today. 
In 2009, Seth’s dad was serving in the 
Army and lost his life a month before 
Seth was born. This is the fourth year 
Seth has joined me through a program 
called Tuesday’s Children. Tuesday’s 
Children uses its experience and exper-
tise to help our military families work 
through their own losses. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope Seth is enjoying 
being my shadow again this year, and I 
can’t wait to see all that he can accom-
plish.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF NICHOLAS TROIANIELLO 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life and leg-
acy of Nicholas Troianiello, a true 
American hero from Staten Island, 
New York. 
After 
graduating 
Port 
Richmond 
High School in 1944, Nicholas joined 
the New York Guard where he served 
for 1 year before enlisting in the Ma-
rine Corps during World War II. 
On February 19, 1945, Nicholas was 
one of 30,000 brave marines to land on 
the island of Iwo Jima for a battle that 
lasted 5 weeks and was one of the 
bloodiest battles during World War II. 
Nicholas was awarded the Purple Heart 
and the Conspicuous Service Award for 
his service to our great Nation. 
Following his service, Nicolas re-
turned to Staten Island to serve once 
again, this time as a member of the 
New York City Fire Department. He 
served for four decades until he retired 
with the esteemed title of lieutenant. 
Sadly, Nicholas passed away last 
year at the age of 94. This weekend, I 
was honored to join local colleagues 
and Nicholas’ family at a street nam-
ing ceremony last week to remember 
his life, legacy, and dedication to our 
community. 
Nicholas was a true American hero 
who loved our country and our city, 
and I am proud to recognize his service 
today.

3522, 
the 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend- 
Lease Act under a closed rule. 
The rule provides for 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The 
rule provides for one motion to com-
mit. 
The rule extends recess instructions, 
suspension authority, and same day au-
thority through May 13, 2022. Finally, 
the rule deems H. Res. 1035 as passed. 
Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin’s crimi-
nal war of aggression and atrocity 
against 
the 
sovereign 
nation 
of 
Ukraine has dismembered the second 
largest country in Europe. Putin’s sol-
diers have killed more than 2,700 
Ukrainian civilians and more than 100 
children in Ukraine. They have raped 
and 
murdered 
untold 
numbers 
of 
women, leaving their bodies in the 
street. They have wounded thousands 
of civilians. They have displaced 10 
million Ukrainians, creating the larg-
est exodus of displaced persons since 
the Nazis rampaged through Europe. 
They have traumatized a nation. 
It is a sobering thing to canvas the 
damage today, which is Holocaust Re-
membrance Day. Putin’s invasion is in-
tended to deal a fatal blow to democ-
racy in Ukraine and around the world. 
Putin’s lurch into fascist aggression 
has actually unified and galvanized the 
democratic world, the democratic na-
tions, and peoples and movements of 
the world. 
I concede that Putin still has his 
cheerleaders for his homophobia, his 
corruption, and his white nationalist 
racism around the world. I concede 
that some people, even in this body, 
continue to chant the filthy words 
‘‘Russia hoax’’ to describe what we 
know from our own intelligence com-
munity of Putin’s unceasing efforts to 
subvert democracy all over the world. I 
concede that Vladimir Putin has been 
called a genius by a former twice-im-
peached President for his assault on a 
sovereign democratic nation. 
The vast majority of Americans and 
vast majority of democratic societies 
around the world reject Putin’s atroc-
ities 
against 
democracy. 
President 
Zelenskyy and President Biden have 
rallied the world against Putin and in 
defense of the heroic people of Ukraine 
standing strong against this aggres-
sion—people who have more courage in 
their pinky than Vladimir Putin and 
his thugs will ever be able to under-
stand. 
Mr. Speaker, NATO members have 
sent or promised at least $8 billion in 
weapons to Ukraine. The billions we 
have sent from the United States of

April 28, 2022 
America has made a key difference in 
allowing the people of Ukraine to de-
fend themselves. The people of America 
paid for anti-tank and anti-air sys-
tems, for helicopters, for drones, for 
grenade 
launchers, 
for 
50 
million 
rounds of ammunition, and more. 
Today, the Ukraine Democracy De-
fense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 comes be-
fore Congress as an important part of 
the effort to defend Ukraine. This act 
is rooted in the lend-lease program of 
World War II, which President Roo-
sevelt proposed in January of 1941, 
which allowed our government to lend 
or to lease war supplies and equipment 
to any nation whose security was de-
fined as vital to the defense and the se-
curity of the United States. 
Passage of that act enabled Great 
Britain and Winston Churchill to keep 
fighting and to survive the fascist Nazi 
bombardment until the United States 
could enter the war. 
President Zelenskyy has said that 
Ukraine needs weapons to sustain 
themselves, and President Biden has 
answered that call with billions in 
military assistance since Russia’s full- 
blown invasion began on February 24, a 
day that will live in infamy in the free-
dom-loving world. 
On April 21, last Thursday, President 
Biden announced that we will be send-
ing an additional $800 million in mili-
tary aid to Ukraine, the eighth such in-
stallment, which will include 72 howit-
zers, 144,000 artillery rounds, 72 tactical 
vehicles, and more than 121 Phoenix 
Ghost tactical drones. Today, I under-
stand President Biden has asked for an 
additional aid package for the next 
several months. 
But S. 3522 will streamline current 
legal authorities under the Arms Ex-
port Control Act that allows our gov-
ernment to lend defense articles needed 
to defend civilian populations. We will 
eliminate red tape to make it easier for 
our government to lend or lease nec-
essary military equipment in this 
struggle to defend Ukraine. 
The legislation requires the Biden ad-
ministration to establish expedited 
procedures 
for 
delivering 
military 
equipment to Ukraine and other af-
fected Eastern European countries to 
defend populations made vulnerable by 
Vladimir Putin’s aggression. It also fa-
cilities the provisioning of loaned and/ 
or leased defense articles to Ukraine, 
easing a myriad of administrative reg-
ulations and processes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman, my good friend from Maryland, 
(Mr. RASKIN), for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration of S. 3522, 
the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend- 
Lease Act of 2022. 
Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying 
that I strongly support this bill, which 
streamlines existing defense authori-
ties to enable the President to enter 
into a lend-lease agreement directly 
with Ukraine and Eastern European 
countries. 
I know I speak for my Republican 
colleagues in expressing my whole-
hearted support for the people of 
Ukraine as they defend themselves and 
their 
democracy 
against 
Vladimir 
Putin’s atrocities. That is why I look 
forward—and so do so many of my col-
leagues—to voting for this bill later 
today. 
However, I have to urge my col-
leagues to oppose this rule as it con-
tinues Speaker PELOSI’s authoritarian 
lockdown of the House of Representa-
tives. 
For over 2 years the Speaker has 
used COVID–19 as an excuse to deny 
Members the ability to advocate on be-
half of the people they represent. This 
rule keeps those oppressive procedures 
in place, despite the fact that even the 
bluest of States are easing their COVID 
restrictions. This is just further proof 
that my colleagues across the aisle 
care only about political science, not 
about real science. 
Further, Mr. Speaker, this rule fails 
to provide for consideration of legisla-
tion to address the serious issues fac-
ing the American people. Under the 
Biden administration, our Nation has 
careened from one crisis to the next. 
Right now, families across the coun-
try are facing a 41-year high in infla-
tion and skyrocketing gas and food 
prices. These are expected to cost the 
average American family $5,000 a year. 
b 1245 
This morning we learned the U.S. 
GDP fell by 1.4 percent during the first 
quarter of 2022. This is getting worse by 
the day. Forty percent of small busi-
nesses are planning to raise prices by 
10 percent just to keep up with infla-
tion. This economic crisis is not the re-
sult of the war in Ukraine as President 
Biden and the leftists on the other side 
of the aisle like to claim. This crisis is 
a direct result of the Democrats’ out- 
of-control spending and their far-left, 
dangerous, radical policies. 
Just look at the fact that inflation 
has increased every month since Joe 
Biden has been President. Putin didn’t 
invade Ukraine until February of this 
year, yet during President Biden’s first 
year in office—again, well before the 
invasion of Ukraine—gas prices jumped 
nearly 53 percent, from $2.25 a gallon to 
$3.44 a gallon. Again, that was before 
Russian soldiers ever crossed the bor-
der in Ukraine. 
But talking about borders, let’s talk 
about our southern border. The border 
crisis is a direct result of Joe Biden’s 
incompetence, and the radical policies 
of the left are leading to disaster. 
Thanks to the open border policy of the 
left, last month over 200,000 illegal im-
migrants were encountered at our 
southern border. That is a new Biden- 
era high. Again, that is over 200,000 il-
legal immigrants. To put this in per-
spective for my colleagues, that is 
roughly three congressional districts. 
Since Biden took office, over 2.4 mil-
lion illegal immigrants have been ap-
prehended at our southern border, in-
cluding more than 40 individuals who 
are on the terrorist watch list. This is 
only going to get worse if President 
Biden gets away with lifting title 42. 
So, again, Mr. Speaker, while I sup-
port S. 3522 and, of course, the people 
of Ukraine, I believe this is a missed 
opportunity to help the American peo-
ple, the people in southwestern Penn-
sylvania, and the people throughout 
this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear 
from my friend from Pennsylvania that 
he supports S. 3522, the Ukraine De-
mocracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. This 
is a moment of grave emergency in 
Ukraine as Putin’s army continues to 
bomb hospitals and schools, rape and 
assault women, and murder the civilian 
population. 
I am, of course, disappointed that 
even when we agree, the minority cau-
cus insists upon disagreeing and bring-
ing up matters that are utterly extra-
neous to this resolution. But my friend 
mentioned 
authoritarian 
lockdowns, 
oppressive procedures, and dangerous 
and radical policies. I didn’t know if he 
was referring to Vladimir Putin or to 
the prior President whose dangerous, 
radical appeasement of Vladimir Putin 
empowered and emboldened him as 
Vladimir Putin has tried to undermine 
NATO; and the last President did ev-
erything in his power to undermine 
NATO and to weaken NATO. But at 
this point we have the opportunity to 
rally the democratic world, the demo-
cratic nations of the world, the demo-
cratic societies, peoples, and move-
ments against Putin’s bloody, imperial 
invasion of Ukraine. 
That is what is on the table right 
now. That is what is on the table in the 
world today. That is where democracy 
is on the line. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Ukraine Democracy Defense 
Lend-Lease Act. 
In the spring of 1941, Congress passed 
the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the 
United States to rapidly deliver weap-
ons and military supplies to Allies like 
Great Britain, assisting their heroic 
fight against Adolph Hitler. Once dead 
set on creating a global empire, he 
failed. 
In the spring of 2022, another mur-
derous dictator has emerged, com-
mitted to destroying a sovereign de-
mocracy and reconstituting old borders 
of the USSR. We must ensure that 
Putin also fails.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4588 
April 28, 2022 
Since Russia’s unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine, the Biden administration 
has made impressive progress in the de-
livery of crucial security assistance to 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. And 
yet, it is time to cut through the re-
maining bureaucratic red tape and ac-
celerate the delivery of critical equip-
ment to the brave warfighters on the 
ground in Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, they deserve nothing 
less than our swift and unwavering sup-
port. Freedom and democracy are at 
stake. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the rule and pass the Ukraine 
Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. 
We must stand with the Ukrainian peo-
ple in their fight for their democracy, 
for their freedom, and for their home-
land. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from 
Maryland said that we just can’t help 
but to disagree. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. This bill could be 
passed on the suspension calendar. This 
is going to pass by well over two-thirds 
vote. It passed, I believe, unanimously 
in the Senate. The fact that we are 
here debating a rule on this instead of 
just passing this on suspension is a 
waste of time. This bill will pass. 
But we have got a real crisis at the 
southern border. We have got inflation. 
Even the Biden administration said we 
are expected to have food shortages. 
We also are failing to project American 
power abroad, which is leading to chaos 
all over the world. 
We agree on the issue with Ukraine, 
yet we are still here wasting valuable 
time that we could be using to address 
real problems. 
But let’s just go back to the southern 
border. As I mentioned earlier in my 
remarks, just in March, encounters at 
the southern border hit a new Biden- 
era high of over 200,000 individuals en-
countered at the southern border. In 
addition to apprehending individuals 
from the terrorist watch list, Border 
Patrol agents are seeing an increase in 
illicit drugs, including deadly fentanyl. 
Alarmingly, fentanyl border seizures 
increased by 134 percent in fiscal year 
2021. President Biden and House Demo-
crats had this open border policy that 
is creating a humanitarian and a secu-
rity crisis both at the border and in our 
communities where people are literally 
dying from fentanyl overdoses. 
With all that in consideration, the 
Democrats and the left still want to do 
away with title 42 and lift it. That is 
why, Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will personally offer 
an amendment to the rule to imme-
diately consider H.R. 471, the PAUSE 
Act of to 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD along with any ex-
traneous material immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK), 
who is the Republican Conference 
chair. She will explain the amendment. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 471, 
the PAUSE Act introduced by the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico, YVETTE 
HERRELL, to ensure title 42 remains in 
place. 
Mr. Speaker, since Joe Biden took of-
fice and started implementing his rad-
ical open border policies, over 2.4 mil-
lion illegal immigrants have been ap-
prehended at our southern border. We 
just had the highest number of border 
encounters in the past 20 years—over 
220,000 in March alone. 
In FY 2022, CBP has seized hundreds 
and hundreds of thousands of pounds of 
drugs and thousands and thousands of 
pounds of illicit fentanyl, the leading 
cause of death for adults aged 18–45. 
What is worse, over 40 people on the 
U.S. terrorist watch list were encoun-
tered at our U.S. southern border. And 
just today, Secretary Mayorkas, when 
asked if those individuals on the U.S. 
terrorist watch list had been released 
into the United States of America, 
could not answer that question. That 
should stun every American. It is unac-
ceptable that the Secretary of Home-
land Security cannot answer a question 
about whether those dangerous terror-
ists have been released into the United 
States of America. 
In fact, just yesterday, in previous 
testimony, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas 
claimed that the Biden administration 
has ‘‘effectively managed’’ the crisis at 
the southern border and delusionally 
believes that the southwest border is 
somehow secure. Let me tell you some-
thing, Mr. Speaker, the American peo-
ple are smart. There is nothing effec-
tive about this border crisis. No good 
management has come from the Biden 
administration when it comes to the 
southern border. 
This has been an invasion. Just look 
at the numbers. President Obama’s 
own Secretary of Homeland Security, 
Jeh Johnson, said 1,000 apprehensions a 
day would be a crisis. We are already at 
the 7,000 mark, and we could see up-
wards of 18,000 a day if title 42 is lifted. 
I just came back with my colleagues 
on a congressional delegation from 
Eagle Pass, Texas, from the Del Rio 
sector of our southern border. This was 
a delegation led by Republican Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, hosted by our col-
league, TONY GONZALES, who has been 
such a tremendous voice standing up 
for his constituents, particularly Bor-
der Patrol officers and their families. 
It was a somber day. Just hours be-
fore, our Border Patrol identified the 
remains of Texas National Guardsman 
Bishop Evans. In fact, I had the oppor-
tunity to go on the boat with the river 
Border Patrol officers, the two individ-
uals who actually identified the re-
mains. 
God bless Bishop Evans. God bless his 
grandmother who has laid him to rest. 
This is irresponsible of Joe Biden; 
and Joe Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, 
and this administration must be held 
accountable. 
We also spoke to ranchers, local lead-
ers, and local elected officials. They 
broke down in tears talking about the 
risks to their livelihood and their fami-
lies. One rancher told us, in fact, that 
his children needed to carry pistols if 
they wanted to go outside and play in 
their yard because they needed to pro-
tect themselves as droves of illegal im-
migrants cross their property. 
Do you know whom they blame, Mr. 
Speaker? 
They blame Joe Biden, and they 
blame this administration who has 
turned their backs on having a secure 
border. They have turned their backs 
on the people, not just of south Texas 
but the people across this country. 
We also witnessed a processing facil-
ity where illegal immigrants were 
given brand new iPhones—just re-
leased. I thought they were doing facial 
recognition technology to run through 
a list. No. They were doing facial rec-
ognition technology to hand the illegal 
immigrants their cell phone paid for by 
U.S. taxpayer dollars. 
This is a crisis. Every district across 
the country is a border district and 
every State is a border district. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from New York. 
Ms. STEFANIK. On top of that, we 
have seen flights in the middle of the 
night relocating illegal immigrants to 
other States across the Nation, includ-
ing my home State of New York. 
This current crisis is untenable. Our 
systems are well-beyond the breaking 
point. The drug crisis caused by our po-
rous border is reaching every part of 
this country causing deaths in every 
congressional district. Every Member 
of Congress needs to step up and secure 
the border. Our colleagues across the 
aisle have had over a year to put forth 
any bill to secure the border. They 
have failed to put forth any single bill, 
and, now, because we are heading to-
ward a November election, they are 
honestly worried. And they should be, 
because 
the 
American 
people 
are 
smart. They know this is a result of 
their failed policies. 
In my district in northern New York, 
I am proud to represent Border Patrol 
officers who have been transferred over 
and over and over again to the south-
ern border. They are stepping up to do 
their job. They are stepping up to ad-
dress this catastrophe caused by Joe 
Biden. 
House Republicans are going to be 
unified. We stand behind the PAUSE 
Act to make sure title 42 remains in 
place, which is why we will oppose the 
previous question.

April 28, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that all of these 
efforts to distract us from the issue at 
hand are meant to cover up the very 
clear pro-Russian and pro-Putin fac-
tion at the heart of their side of the 
aisle. 
Last month in March of this year, 
the very distinguished gentlewoman 
from Georgia went on a radio show 
called the ‘‘Voice of Rural America,’’ 
and she followed Donald Trump’s sick-
ening appeasement of Vladimir Putin 
and blamed Ukraine for the situation. 
She said: 
You see, Ukraine just kept poking the bear 
and poking the bear which is Russia, and 
Russia invaded. There is no win for Ukraine 
here. Russia is successful in this invasion. 
When Members of Congress are cheer-
leaders for Vladimir Putin and are 
voices of nothing but defeatism, fatal-
ism, and pessimism for democracy in 
Europe, then they try to distract us 
with a lot of phony rhetoric about 
other issues. 
She also said: 
NATO has been supplying the neo-Nazis 
with powerful weapons and extensive train-
ing on how to use them. What the hell is 
going on with these NATO Nazis. 
Mr. Speaker, we have to decide which 
side we are on. 
When Franklin and Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Americans looked at what 
was happening in Europe during World 
War II and they saw Nazis marching 
down the street, they did not see very 
fine people on both sides of the street. 
They did not start cheerleading for 
Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco. Yet we 
have people here who go out and speak 
on the side of Vladimir Putin and on 
the side of Russia. 
b 1300 
Let’s pass this Ukraine Democracy 
Defense Lend-Lease Act to show where 
America is. We are not cheerleaders for 
Vladimir Putin. We are not going to 
follow the Trump-Putin axis down the 
road toward autocracy and kleptocracy 
and sedition and insurrection and cor-
ruption and coups in the United States. 
That is not where we are going. 
This is the land of the free, the home 
of the brave. We stand for democracy 
here, not Vladimir Putin. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, many 
people say ours is a nation of immi-
grants. But our Nation also has an un-
fortunate history of political opportun-
ists who attack the latest wave of im-
migrants and seek to stoke fear and 
chaos in order to gain or cling to 
power. 
Whether the attacks were against my 
ancestors, the Irish; those at the south-
ern border today; or the many other 
groups in between, we have heard the 
same language and scare tactics year 
after year, generation after generation. 
But then as now, those attacks are a 
sham. They are attention-seeking to 
divide and distract us from their pro-
ponents’ lack of seriousness, their lack 
of solutions, and, at times, their own 
misconduct. 
Now, I rise today in support of the 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend- 
Lease Act and hope to send it quickly 
to President Biden’s desk. The Senate 
acted quickly to pass this bill and send 
it our way. 
Eighty years ago, the U.S. created 
the lend-lease program to provide mili-
tary and humanitarian aid to Great 
Britain and our Allies in Europe as 
they stood on the front lines to oppose 
the Axis powers that threatened de-
mocracies around the world, including 
our own. 
Today, the Ukrainian people are 
standing on the front lines in the fight 
for democracy and against tyranny. 
The U.S. needs to provide them with 
every possible measure of humani-
tarian and military aid. 
To date, Congress and President 
Biden have led the world in supporting 
the Ukrainian people, sending nearly 
$14 billion in food, medical supplies, 
and military assistance to Ukraine, 
working in close collaboration with our 
allies. 
With this aid, the Ukrainian armed 
forces have been incredibly effective in 
opposing 
Putin’s 
unlawful 
and 
unprovoked invasion. But the Ukrain-
ian success is dependent on them hav-
ing the equipment and supplies to con-
tinue fighting, and this bill will ensure 
that they do. 
This is a bill that every freedom- and 
democracy-loving Member of the House 
should support, and I look forward to 
its swift passage on the floor. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Just two quick points in rebuttal for 
my friend from Pennsylvania. 
First off, if there is concern about 
the humanitarian crisis on the south-
ern border, the best thing you can do is 
try to bring order to that southern bor-
der. The trek that these individuals 
have to take is incredibly dangerous. 
Women and children are often ex-
ploited. Coyotes are making literally 
millions of dollars. Oftentimes, when 
the illegal immigrants come to the 
United States, they are put in sort of 
indentured servant status to the drug 
cartels and the coyotes. 
The perverse thing about arguing 
that you care about people is that if 
you really did care about the humani-
tarian crisis, you would share the Re-
publican viewpoint of law and order. 
Secondly, to the fact that we need to 
act quickly on the bill regarding 
Ukraine, my colleagues across the aisle 
could have passed this bill on Tuesday. 
The fact that we are here wasting time 
on a bill that could have passed by sus-
pension just shows the lack of serious-
ness on the other issues facing the 
American people. To act quickly, my 
colleagues should have been advocating 
this bill be run on Tuesday on suspen-
sion. 
Here to talk more about these issues 
is the Republican leader of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee, Mr. 
JAMES
COMER
of Kentucky, who re-
cently led a delegation to the southern 
border. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, Oversight 
and Reform Committee Republicans 
witnessed firsthand the crisis on the 
border after the southern border trip I 
led earlier this month. 
By pushing blanket amnesty and 
eroding interior enforcement, Presi-
dent Biden has now signaled to the 
world that our laws can be violated 
with little to no consequence. 
In 2021, over 2 million apprehensions 
of illegal immigrants were made. This 
is the most ever recorded by U.S. Bor-
der Patrol. In fact, I want to quote 
Punchbowl News because they really 
put it into perspective yesterday morn-
ing when they reported: ‘‘According to 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
during the past 3 weeks, the agency has 
‘encountered an average of 7,800 mi-
grants per day across the southwest 
border. This compares to a historical 
average 
of 
1,600 
per 
day 
in 
the 
prepandemic years,’ a roughly 480 per-
cent increase.’’ 
The surge of illegal immigrants is 
overwhelming 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security. As a result, DHS 
was forced to release hundreds of thou-
sands of these illegal border crossers 
into the United States. 
Catch and release does not work. It 
only encourages more illegal immigra-
tion. The numbers we have don’t even 
account for illegal immigrants who 
have evaded capture entirely. That 
number is estimated to be in the hun-
dreds of thousands. 
The situation only gets worse when 
we look at how much fentanyl and 
other deadly drugs are being smuggled 
across the border by cartels. On our 
trip, we witnessed hundreds of dis-
carded backpacks littering the ground, 
backpacks that once carried illicit nar-
cotics. 
The Biden administration’s border 
policies have only boosted the human 
smuggling industry and empowered 
drug cartels. 
Now, President Biden’s decision to 
terminate the CDC’s public health 
order under title 42 on May 23 will turn 
this national security and humani-
tarian crisis into a catastrophe. 
Former Obama administration Sec-
retary of Homeland Security Johnson 
once said that only 1,000 apprehensions 
per day was ‘‘a relatively bad number’’ 
that ‘‘overwhelms the system.’’ He de-
scribed 4,000 apprehensions per day as a 
crisis. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity now predicts as many as 12,000 to 
18,000 illegal migrants per day will at-
tempt to cross the border because of 
President Biden’s policies when the

42 
order 
terminates, 
over-
whelming the congregate processing fa-
cilities in ports and Border Patrol sta-
tions that we toured along the border 
in California and Arizona. 
This administration’s plan to address 
this catastrophe boils down to simply 
speeding up the release of even more il-
legal border crossers. Mr. Speaker, that 
is no plan at all. Placing illegal immi-
grants over Americans is unacceptable. 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
Republicans have been at the forefront 
of this crisis, demanding answers and 
seeking to hold the administration ac-
countable to the American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-
ican people should know this: We will 
persist in exposing the waste, fraud, 
abuse, and mismanagement by this ad-
ministration that has led to this cur-
rent crisis. We will do everything in 
our power to stop the flow of fentanyl 
across President Biden’s broken border. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I find this astounding. 
We are here to talk about aid to 
Ukraine, how to streamline and expe-
dite aid to defend the people of 
Ukraine, and they will talk about any-
thing but. 
I was willing to believe that the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from Georgia 
and several other Members were iso-
lated in their Conference. Now, I am 
starting to think that maybe they are 
speaking for the whole Conference. 
I wonder if my good friend from 
Pennsylvania would explicitly repu-
diate some of these statements made 
by the gentlewoman from Georgia. 
Does the minority Conference agree 
that NATO has been supplying the 
‘‘neo-Nazis in Ukraine’’ with powerful 
weapons? 
Does the distinguished gentleman 
from Pennsylvania support or dis-
sociate himself from the argument that 
the aid that we send to Ukraine falls 
‘‘into the hands of Nazis,’’ a statement 
made by the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia, echoing Putin’s filthy claim that 
his war on the sovereign democracy of 
Ukraine is, in fact, an attempt to 
denazify the country? 
Of course, we hear distinct echoes in 
everything that we get from the eru-
dite gentlewoman from Georgia. 
Does the minority agree that Putin 
invaded because Ukraine repeatedly 
poked the bear? 
I mean, I can’t understand why they 
won’t talk about defending Ukraine. 
That is what this legislation is about. 
That is what this rule is about. They 
want to talk about anything other 
than that. 
We can debate all of those other im-
portant issues in other contexts at the 
right time. This is how the House of 
Representatives works. But why are 
they covering up for the pro-Putin fac-
tion within their Conference? I would 
like them to dissociate themselves 
from the people who are blaming 
Ukraine for Russia’s bloody imperial 
invasion and war of human rights vio-
lations and atrocities against the peo-
ple. Please do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to oppose the previous ques-
tion so that we can immediately con-
sider H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act of 2021. 
This important bill, introduced by 
my 
good 
friend 
YVETTE
HERRELL, 
would maintain health screening pro-
tections at the border and ensure that 
the Biden administration does not 
allow foreigners to enter our country 
illegally without being properly vetted. 
I am from Georgia. For those of us 
that don’t live in border States, it is a 
lot different when we see on the news 
the stories of the massive invasion at 
our southern border. It is a lot dif-
ferent when we read about it. 
But when I went to the border just a 
few days ago with Congressman TONY 
GONZALES—he put together a great 
trip, and I am so grateful—it became 
very clear to me. What is happening at 
our southern border is a crisis of epic 
proportions, and it is difficult to com-
prehend it until you actually see it in 
person. 
This is a complete human and drug 
trafficking operation that is doing 
nothing for Americans but hurting our 
country and enriching the cartels. 
They have grown their network and ex-
panded it massively throughout their 
country, into our country, far-reach-
ing, even into our cities, as was ex-
plained to us by the Border Patrol, 
where they recruit from our own Amer-
ican cities to come down to Mexico to 
help them traffic humans and drugs 
across our southern border. 
This should never be happening, and 
it certainly was not happening not long 
ago under the Trump administration, 
where we had the most secure border 
we have had in decades. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our Congress to 
take this very seriously. As we are dis-
cussing other countries and other bor-
ders, this is the one country where we 
all swear an oath to uphold our laws 
and defend our Constitution, and we 
serve the American people from each of 
our own districts. 
We should be taking extreme serious-
ness to this invasion at our southern 
border, not only for the COVID–19 pan-
demic but also for the many other dan-
gerous diseases such as tuberculosis 
and others that they bring into our 
country. 
Passing title 42 is imperative, and it 
is the most important thing this Con-
gress can do at this time, as there is an 
average of 7,000 people coming across 
the border every single day and hun-
dreds of thousands of got-aways that 
we don’t know who they are, where 
they are from, and what their purpose 
and intent is to do in the United States 
of America. 
We already know that 42 known ter-
rorists have been apprehended at our 
southern border, but we don’t know 
how many terrorists exist in those hun-
dreds of thousands of got-aways. 
When I listen to a grown man cry 
over the amount of illegal aliens that 
are, 24 hours a day, coming across his 
ranch in Eagle Pass, it is a shame, and 
it is a tragedy. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States of 
America just witnessed the most aston-
ishing spectacle. We are here to debate 
aid to the people of Ukraine defending 
themselves against a massive invasion 
by Vladimir Putin and his army. Then, 
the minority puts up the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Georgia, who does 
not mention Ukraine once. 
She does not mention the thousands 
of Ukrainian civilians who have been 
slaughtered by Putin’s army. She does 
not mention more than 100 Ukrainian 
children who have been shot and killed 
by the Russian army. Instead, she talks 
about a massive invasion at the border, 
a massive invasion, which their own 
speakers have said, today, hundreds of 
thousands of people have been appre-
hended in. 
That is very different from a military 
invasion, the one in Ukraine. Of course, 
the gentlewoman is not going to talk 
about that. She had a lot to say the 
other day when she heckled me con-
tinuously. When I came to the floor, it 
was like ‘‘The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show’’ in here with her chanting about 
the Russia hoax and Russia this and 
Russia that. 
Now, she had the opportunity to tell 
the world what her views about Russia 
are. I put them out there, exactly what 
she has said. She said that the aid that 
the taxpayers of America are sending 
to the people of Ukraine to defend 
themselves against Vladimir Putin and 
the Russian army falls into the hands 
of Nazis. 
b 1315 
I want to see her proof. 
Where is her evidence? 
She talks about NATO Nazis. Does 
the minority believe that our allies in 
NATO, who are trying to defend the 
people of Ukraine, are Nazis? Has it 
come to this? 
The gentlewoman talked about mas-
sive invasion. We had a massive inva-
sion of our own Chamber. * * * 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I would request to have words taken 
down. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland will be seated. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw the of-
fending remark. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4591 
April 28, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the words are withdrawn. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the House 
rules do forbid engaging in personal-
ities. I accept the advice of the Parlia-
mentarian that I used unparliamentary 
language to make my point, and I cer-
tainly respect the necessity for par-
liamentary decorum. 
b 1330 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close when my friend from 
Pennsylvania is prepared to close, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I would tell my colleague across the 
aisle that I still have several speakers, 
just so we are on the same page. 
Mr. Speaker, there were comments 
made prior regarding why we, on our 
side of the aisle, are not talking about 
the underlying bill. 
The answer to that is very simple. 
Let’s put this into perspective. 
We are here debating the rule. 
We are not debating final passage. In 
fact, we don’t need to debate final pas-
sage because the vast majority of my 
colleagues agree on this particular bill. 
We are not here debating final passage 
of the bill. 
We are debating, in essence, the rest 
of the legislative calendar for the day. 
We simply are arguing that in this cal-
endar and in the agenda for the rest of 
the day, we should be considering other 
important matters, such as the crisis 
at the southern border. 
So I just felt like I needed to put that 
in perspective. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST), my good friend. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose the previous question. 
Right now, the men and women of 
law enforcement are battling to secure 
our borders. Every day they are push-
ing 
back 
against 
drug 
smugglers, 
human traffickers, and the cartels. 
Make no mistake, this is the worst bor-
der crisis in our Nation’s history and 
this administration took just over a 
year to bring our national security to 
this state. 
I know because I have seen it myself. 
I was at the border a few days ago for 
my second trip in two weeks and I 
heard from the men and women on the 
border. Every single person we talked 
with told the same story. They told us 
that this administration, President 
Biden’s administration, has abandoned 
them. They asked us to please provide 
help. 
Instead of providing help, President 
Biden and many of my colleagues on 
the left have attacked the last tool the 
men and women of law enforcement 
have to perform their duties. 
Without the Court’s intervention, 
this 
administration 
would 
have 
stripped the last tool these law en-
forcement officers have to secure our 
border. I am glad that some of my col-
leagues across the aisle have seen the 
value in preserving title 42. 
They have seen the importance of se-
curing our borders against criminals 
and terrorists that we know are ex-
ploiting the crisis to enter America. 
They see the devastating impact that 
18,000 encounters a day would have on 
communities across our Nation if title 
42 is removed. Most importantly, they 
see the hard work of the men and 
women of law enforcement on the bor-
der, and like Republicans, they want to 
help. 
I hope the rest of the Democratic 
Caucus will join them and support 
these men and women who are risking 
their lives to secure our Nation. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my good friend from 
Pennsylvania suggests that this is 
something that we didn’t actually need 
to bring to the floor, that it could have 
been done on a suspension vote. And 
yet, I am certain that my dear friend is 
aware that a number of suspension 
votes on things as simple as post office 
renamings have been voted down by 
the minority. 
There was a distinguished judge who 
a post office was going to be named 
after and that was sabotaged on a sus-
pension vote. There have been multiple 
votes like that. 
In fact, we have a resolution that we 
put forward to affirm support for 
NATO and its democratic principles. 
And that was rejected by 63 Members of 
the minority caucus; 63 Members voted 
against a resolution expressing un-
equivocal support for a strong NATO 
and for the democratic principles un-
derlying it. 
Mr. Speaker, I would love if it were 
as simple as he was suggesting, that we 
could all agree to this, but they are not 
agreeing with the things that we are 
putting forward about the need to 
unite for democracy around the world. 
That is why we are precisely in this 
situation we are in. 
Even when we are trying to talk 
about the importance of this new lend- 
lease expediting program to allow the 
U.S. Government to lend military 
equipment, to lease military equip-
ment to Ukraine and to get it done 
quickly, it seems like our friends keep 
on wanting to change the subject to 
talk about anything other than that. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what to 
say other than I wish we were unified 
in supporting this rule for the legisla-
tion that we are bringing forward to 
make it a lot easier to get support to 
the people of Ukraine, the support they 
need to fight off the bloody military in-
vasion being conducted by Putin’s 
army. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN), my good 
friend, to rebut the gentleman from 
Maryland. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, it is frustrating to hear the polit-
ical games being played, when a piece 
of legislation isn’t really about what it 
is intended to be about or what the 
title says that it is. 
My colleague, whom I have respect 
for, and have watched him argue co-
gently on some issues, is actually in-
correct on this. Suggesting that be-
cause I voted ‘‘no’’ on this bill I some-
how don’t support NATO, it is really, 
quite frankly, absurd. 
I remember being in Iraq in 2003 when 
British SAS soldiers were wounded, 
and my Tier One task force went in, 
and we pulled those guys off the battle-
field wounded. I took care of them in 
the back of the helicopter. I am fully 
supportive of NATO. 
Quite frankly, it angers me that the 
suggestion because I voted on a piece of 
legislation that had a clause in it that 
didn’t make sense to me that I am 
somehow not supportive of NATO. No 
one has been more supportive of NATO. 
Yes, many of us voted ‘‘no’’ on that 
bill, but it was because it created this 
extra body to discuss democracy when 
we are at war trying to save a democ-
racy. 
How about we focus NATO on what is 
going on in Ukraine and not forming 
some new discussion group about de-
mocracy? 
So, yeah, several of us voted no. But 
I assure you, Mr. Speaker, and my col-
league from Maryland, that has noth-
ing to do with a lack of support for 
NATO. Because when I was on that bat-
tlefield helping that British SAS war-
rior and they are supporting us, I 
didn’t see a lot of other people who 
might be pointing a finger at us for not 
supporting NATO on that battlefield 
that day. There was nobody in this 
room in that helicopter flying into 
Baghdad with me. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished gentleman for his service, of 
course, and also for his clarification 
about his particular vote. 
The House Resolution we are talking 
about is 831, calling on the United 
States 
Government 
to 
uphold 
the 
founding democratic principles of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and establishing a center for demo-
cratic 
resilience 
within 
the 
head-
quarters of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
Of course, everyone in the majority 
voted for it. I think the vast majority 
of the people on the gentleman’s side of 
the aisle voted for it, but there were 63 
Members who did find this or that 
clause objectionable and, therefore, 
voted against it. But that is precisely 
my point. 
My good friend from Pennsylvania 
takes me to task for saying, Why 
didn’t we just do this on a suspension 
vote basis, just bring it up here and let 
it glide through. Because nothing is 
simple when we are talking about these 
issues. 
There are some people who are out 
there on the radio calling NATO Nazis 
and saying that the money that Ameri-
cans are putting into Ukraine is going

to support Nazis. I haven’t heard any-
body renounce or repudiate that point 
of view. 
Then there are others who find far 
more substantive and defensible prob-
lems with what we are doing. 
In any event, they have been voting 
against it, so we were not able to do a 
suspension resolution. So we bring it 
up to have a discussion about Ukraine 
to see if we can get unity and then they 
take us off in 50 other directions. 
It is a sad thing to see that when 
President Zelenskyy and the people of 
Ukraine have demonstrated democratic 
courage, bravery, and valor to the en-
tire world, and democratic societies 
are trying to get together to mobilize 
behind democracy to oppose what 
Vladimir Putin and his gang of thugs 
in Moscow and their allies in different 
places, like Orban in Hungary and— 
well, I don’t want to get into the whole 
rogues’ gallery of tyrants and bullies 
that they have gathered to support 
them. 
We have got to be building the demo-
cratic forces. We should be together on 
this. We should be able to think about 
this in a far broader way than just 
talking points for the next election. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, let me just be clear. We are not 
going down several roads. We are going 
down one road with this argument and 
that is the southern border. 
I am willing to bet that this vote will 
pass, the underlying bill will pass with 
over a two-thirds vote. We could have 
tried to run this on Tuesday. Even if it 
did fail, we could have been here run-
ning it today. 
We have delayed this when we have 
serious business to discuss, particu-
larly the southern border. And that is 
what we are debating; the fact that the 
legislative business for today should 
include the crisis at the southern bor-
der. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
my good friend, and a good pharmacist, 
to talk more about the crisis at the 
southern border. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to oppose the previous ques-
tion so that we can immediately con-
sider H.R. 471 to reinstate title 42 and 
protect our Nation from the influx of 
drugs and illegal immigrants flocking 
across our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no coincidence that 
a 480 percent spike in border encoun-
ters, combined with a 68 percent drop 
in deportations, has led to the most 
deadly 
year 
on 
record 
for 
opioid 
overdoses. 
This administration must answer for 
its atrocious public health record. The 
fentanyl that is invading our schools 
and killing our children is coming 
across the southern border. No mask is 
going to protect them from the dangers 
hiding in what appears to be an every-
day painkiller. And this administration 
isn’t going to protect them either. 
Unlike President Biden and border 
czar, Harris, I have been to the south-
ern border. In fact, I have been there 
four times. I have seen the gaping holes 
where a wall should be, the vast areas 
of land where smugglers can walk into 
our country virtually unchecked. 
Lifting title 42 will open the flood 
gates even further. Like pouring hot 
water into a cold glass, the rule of law 
at our southern border is shattering. 
Right now, in America, your child is 
forced to be vaccinated and wear a 
mask in order to attend school, but il-
legal immigrants are bused around the 
country without so much as a COVID 
test. 
Explain to me how a President can 
justify extending pandemic-era student 
loan pauses, advocate for mask man-
dates on airplanes, and insist on vac-
cine mandates for healthcare workers, 
but when it comes to protecting our 
immigration system, suddenly the pan-
demic is no longer a concern. 
If you are worried about contracting 
COVID, I suggest spending time at the 
southern border, because apparently, 
you can’t contract it there. 
Title 42 is a necessary rule that is 
preventing our border crisis from be-
coming a full-blown catastrophe. Re-
moving it now would shackle our Bor-
der Patrol agents and threaten our im-
migration system, as we know it. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I am prepared to close, and I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just start by re-
iterating that I and the vast majority 
of my colleagues support S. 3522, and 
we look forward to voting on that bill 
later 
today. 
We 
need 
to 
bolster 
Ukraine’s defense capability and pro-
tect vulnerable civilian populations in 
Ukraine. 
However, we are debating the rule 
right now. The rule before us extends 
Speaker PELOSI’s authoritarian COVID 
lockdown that has stripped rank-and- 
file Members of their ability to advo-
cate for the people they represent. 
Let’s just look at the stats. Ninety 
percent of the country is in a low-risk 
community level. That is according to 
the CDC; over 90 percent of the coun-
try. So why is the Speaker so afraid to 
let the House get back to work? 
If the Speaker followed the real 
science, not the political science the 
left has followed through this entire 
pandemic, the Speaker would allow the 
people’s House to resume regular busi-
ness. 
Further, this rule is a missed oppor-
tunity to address the serious issues 
that are facing American families. 
American families are getting ham-
mered by inflation. Gas prices are out 
of control. The border crisis is raging, 
and we are being told by President 
Biden that we are expected to face food 
shortages in future months. 
b 1345 
On top of all that bad news, just this 
morning, we learned the GDP de-
creased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent 
in the first quarter of 2022. Our GDP is 
decreasing. This is the weakest show-
ing since the pandemic recovery began 
and this falls well below the projec-
tions of economists. 
So, instead of passing legislation to 
address the serious economic crisis we 
are facing and the serious security 
issue we are facing at the southern bor-
der, Democratic leadership is sending 
the House home a day early. We were 
supposed to be here tomorrow. Yet, we 
are getting sent home early, despite all 
these issues facing the American peo-
ple. 
We can do a lot more for this country 
and the American people. For that rea-
son, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on 
the rule, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank my friend for our lively dis-
cussion today. And I am glad to hear, 
again, that he supports the Ukraine 
Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 
2022, S. 3522. I wish we could have fo-
cused on the meaning of this legisla-
tion, rather than for them to fight 
about the rule and to raise subjects 
that are not part of this legislation. 
More than 10 million Ukrainians 
have been forced out of their homes; 
have been forced to flee in the worst 
mass exodus of refugees since World 
War II. Thousands of Ukrainian civil-
ians have been killed. More than 100 
Ukrainian children have been mur-
dered by Putin’s Army. 
And I have heard the word authori-
tarian uttered on the other side of the 
aisle today, and it applies to whom? 
Not Vladimir Putin. They used it to 
apply to NANCY PELOSI, to the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, be-
cause they disagree with some inter-
pretations of the rules of the House. 
Well, this is a serious moment for 
people who are serious about democ-
racy in the new century. If allowed to 
continue, Vladimir Putin will spread 
his 
rampage 
beyond 
Ukraine 
into 
neighboring countries in Eastern Eu-
rope, and then other authoritarian and 
autocratic leaders around the world 
will decide they will be able to do to 
their neighbors what Vladimir Putin 
was allowed to do to his neighbor. 
This legislation is named after what 
President Roosevelt made happen dur-
ing World War II, the Lend-Lease pro-
gram that, without declaring war, 
America would come to the aid of its 
allies by lending and leasing military 
equipment to our allies in order to se-
cure the democratic world. And that is 
where we are again. 
So we need to streamline all of the 
red tape. We need to expedite the deliv-
ery of equipment to our allies in 
Ukraine. And I hope we will hear the 
end of the constant statements of de-
featism and pessimism and surrender 
that we get from so many people who 
are out there and continue to take the 
position of the former President Trump

H4593 
April 28, 2022 
that Vladimir Putin is some kind of ge-
nius for invading his neighbor. He is 
not a genius. He is a mass murderer. He 
is not a genius. He is a human rights 
violator, and he is a perpetrator of war 
crimes. 
The world needs to know where 
America stands. And we should stand, 
if we could, unified, for the people of 
Ukraine, for democracy in Europe, and 
for democracy all around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1065 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 5. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 471. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the

the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

vilian populations in Ukraine from 
Russian military invasion, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1065, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3522 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine De-
mocracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. LOAN AND LEASE OF DEFENSE ARTICLES 
TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF UKRAINE 
AND EASTERN FLANK COUNTRIES. 
(a) AUTHORITY TO LEND OR LEASE DEFENSE 
ARTICLES TO CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), 
for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the President 
may authorize the United States Govern-
ment to lend or lease defense articles to the 
Government of Ukraine or to governments of 
Eastern European countries impacted by the 
Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine to

bilities and protect their civilian popu-
lations from potential invasion or ongoing 
aggression by the armed forces of the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation. 
(2) EXCLUSIONS.—For the purposes of the 
authority described in paragraph (1) as that 
authority relates to Ukraine, the following 
provisions of law shall not apply: 
(A) Section 503(b)(3) of the Foreign Assist-

b 1445 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 3522. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy 
Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022. 
When Russia launched its renewed 
war 
against 
Ukraine, 
it 
thought 
Ukraine would fall in a matter of days. 
Putin and Russia thought the West 
would be divided, unable to offer 
Ukraine the support that it needed. 
They thought the world would believe 
their Russian lies. They thought that 
we would never stay together. 
Well, Madam Speaker, on all ac-
counts, Putin has been proven wrong. 
Two months ago, the people of Ukraine 
united in defense of their home. I vis-
ited Ukraine at that time, before the 
invasion, and they said: We will fight; 
we will defend our democracy and our 
country. 
Then 
what 
happened? 
President 
Biden kept all 30 nations of NATO to-
gether, joining with and bringing along 
other allies and other democracies 
from around the world, all united like 
never before. We have jointly imposed 
devastating sanctions on Russia and 
provided Ukraine with billions of dol-
lars of security, humanitarian, and 
economic assistance. And we have dem-
onstrated to Putin and to the Russian 
Government that their actions have 
left them isolated. 
At the time, our goal was clear: Help 
Ukraine do what we heard the people 
ask us to do, defend themselves. But it 
is now abundantly clear that we must 
adjust our assumptions and our strate-
gies and that we must help Ukraine, as 
Secretary Austin said, win. 
I strongly support the efforts of the 
administration, in coordination and in 
close cooperation with Congress, to 
provide as much assistance as we can 
to help Ukraine protect itself. We must 
look forward to what Ukraine needs to 
fend off the renewed Russian offensive 
in the east and, ultimately, win this 
war, to retake territory, to liberate the 
towns and cities from Russian occupa-
tion and ongoing Russian war crimes, 
and to maintain and regain their sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity. 
This bill is a further step in that di-
rection of thinking toward the long 
term. It can and must be part of a 
strategy to not only continue pro-
viding Ukraine with the weapons sys-
tems its soldiers are well trained to 
use, 
including 
Russian 
tanks 
and 
planes, the U.S.- and NATO-origin 
antiair and antitank missile systems 
and drones, but also to step up our 
training efforts. Through additional 
training, we will be able to provide 
more and more advanced equipment. 
The administration already has the 
authority to lend and lease equipment 
to allies and partners to support the 
United States’ national security inter-
ests, and it has already been using all 
the funds that Congress has given it 
previously. This bill will allow the ad-
ministration to cut through the red 
tape in existing lend-lease authorities 
to facilitate another channel by which 
all this vital support can be provided. 
Specifically, this bill streamlines the 
processes to facilitate the administra-
tion’s provisioning of lent or leased de-
fense articles to Ukraine or Eastern 
European countries impacted by Rus-
sia’s invasion for fiscal year 2022 and 
fiscal year 2023. It does so by exempt-
ing the administration from provisions 
of law that limit the duration of loaned 
equipment to 5 years only, as well as 
exempting such loaned and leased 
equipment from repayment of costs in-
curred by doing so. 
In short, it does not create a new pro-
gram, as lend-lease authority is al-
ready enshrined in law, but it gives the 
administration 
added 
flexibility 
in 
using an existing program to get vital 
support to Ukraine. 
I strongly support this bill, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to show the 
same unity that our allies have shown 
as we fight off this vicious invasion by 
Putin and Russia in Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy De-
fense Lend-Lease Act of 2022. 
Madam Speaker, it is absolutely 
amazing the unintended consequence of 
Vladimir Putin, war criminal Putin, 
that he has brought Democrats and Re-
publicans together. He has united the 
people of the United States. With the 
leadership of Chairman GREG MEEKS 
and Ranking Member MIKE MCCAUL, 
Americans are united in their support 
of the people of Ukraine. 
For 63 days, the courageous people of 
Ukraine have resisted full-scale inva-
sion by war criminal Putin with his 
murderous occupying forces, in large 
part due to the courageous leadership 
of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
Ukrainians 
have 
witnessed 
their 
prosperous homeland being attacked 
and the lives of their loved ones sense-
lessly murdered. The world has been a 
witness to the countless atrocities in-
flicted upon the Ukrainian people, and 
we continue to see the depravity of the 
Putin forces in real time, targeting ci-
vilians and humanitarian infrastruc-
ture with mass murder, just as they 
conducted 
gruesomely 
in 
Aleppo, 
Syria. 
Ukraine’s request is simple: Provide 
the weapons needed to defend the 
Ukrainian homeland and Ukrainian 
families. This bill does just that by re-
moving bureaucratic red tape to sup-
port a loan or lease of defense articles 
to Ukraine immediately.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4596 
April 28, 2022 
I am grateful to have introduced the 
House 
bipartisan 
version 
of 
the 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend- 
Lease Act of 2022 and to work with our 
colleagues to bring this legislation to 
the floor today. 
Time is of the essence. Every day 
that goes by means more innocent lives 
lost. Congress has been united in its 
support of Ukraine, and we have given 
the administration the capacity to use 
funds under a Presidential Drawdown 
Authority specifically for Ukraine. 
Today, with the passage of this bill, 
we remain unified in our solidarity 
with the people of Ukraine. 
There is a successful historical prece-
dent for lend-lease. During World War 
II, lend-lease was enacted to provide 
weapons to Great Britain, the Soviet 
Union, and 28 other Allies to defeat 
Nazi Germany. Lend-lease proved inte-
gral in the outcome of the siege of Len-
ingrad. 
On May 5, 2005, I led a codel to Saint 
Petersburg. We, sadly, were there at 
the world’s largest open cemetery to 
provide a wreath to recognize the ap-
preciation of the people of the United 
States to the people of Russia. This is 
the final resting place of 420,000 civil-
ians and 50,000 soldiers who died when 
Hitler’s murderous forces invaded. 
America saved what is now Saint Pe-
tersburg, which is the birthplace of 
Putin. It is ironic in history that 
America now is considering this crit-
ical legislation to help Ukrainians 
avoid further loss of life at the hands of 
Putin’s murderous forces. 
Ukraine’s battle for its sovereignty is 
in the forefront of the fight between 
autocracy, which is the rule of gun, 
versus democracy, which is the rule of 
law. Their success is the success of de-
mocracy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support passage of the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of this body. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. MEEKS), the chairman of the com-
mittee, for yielding. I thank him for 
his leadership in bringing this bill to 
the floor quickly and effectively. I 
thank Mr. WILSON, who represents the 
minority, and also Mr. MCCAUL, who is 
the ranking member of the committee, 
for bringing this. I thank Mrs. SPARTZ 
for bringing this issue to the personal 
attention of all of us, with her personal 
knowledge of Ukraine and her love of 
her native country. 
Madam Speaker, in 1940, after the 
Battle of France had ended and the 
Battle of Britain was beginning, Win-
ston Churchill stood before the House 
of Commons and declared that the 
United Kingdom would fight on, if nec-
essary, for years; if necessary, alone. 
Britain would fight by itself for some 
time, but it was not alone. Even 
though America was not at war, we 
made a strategic and moral determina-
tion that we must help Britain defend 
itself against fascism. To do that, we 
set up the lend-lease program, which 
cut through red tape and enabled crit-
ical American military aid to reach 
our Allies quickly so they could win 
the Battle of Britain, hold back the 
forces of fascism, and begin a counter-
offensive in North Africa. 
Lend-lease established America as 
what President Franklin Roosevelt 
called the great arsenal of democracy. 
Today, the battle for democracy is 
taking place in another European na-
tion, Ukraine. The Ukrainian people 
are the ones engaged in combat di-
rectly. They are at the point of the 
spear. They are the ones experiencing 
death and destruction and displace-
ment. They are directly in the line of 
the Russian troops to repel Vladimir 
Putin’s criminal and unprovoked inva-
sion, an act that recalls the infamous 
attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 
1941: unprovoked, unjustified, unac-
ceptable. 
But they are not alone in this fight. 
Already, the Biden-Harris administra-
tion and our allies have sent billions of 
dollars’ worth of lethal military aid to 
help Ukraine defend itself against 
Putin’s unlawful and immoral aggres-
sion. 
I heard the words of my friend from 
South Carolina that Putin has brought 
us together, has unified us, unified us 
as a NATO alliance, unified us as a Eu-
ropean Union and the United States of 
America, unified us as a Congress, that 
this shall not stand. Already, the 
Biden-Harris administration and our 
allies have sent billions of dollars’ 
worth of lethal military aid to help 
Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s 
unlawful and immoral aggression. 
Putin, of course, meant the battle for 
Kyiv to be short-lived, to last days, and 
to see Ukraine’s democratic govern-
ment overthrown and a quisling regime 
installed. 
The battle of Kyiv, however, was won 
by the forces of freedom, thanks to the 
extraordinary heroism and courage of 
Kyiv’s defenders and the antitank 
weapons and other equipment supplied 
by America and its NATO allies. They 
are not alone. 
Now, with war raging in Ukraine’s 
east, we are rapidly sending additional 
arms to the Ukrainians that will help 
them hold the line against Russian 
forces and engage in the kind of coun-
teroffensive that will defeat Russia’s 
invasion. 
How extraordinarily ironic it is that 
Putin urges us not to escalate the war 
as 
Putin 
escalates 
it 
hourly, 
unjustifiably, criminally, despicably. 
Every negative adjective you can find 
applies 
to 
the 
unwarranted, 
unprovoked, and unacceptable aggres-
sion Russia has made on its neighbors. 
b 1500 
As I told The Danish Foreign Policy 
Society when I was visiting with our 
allies earlier this month, the invasion 
of Ukraine must end in a strategic de-
feat for Putin and global criminality. 
Anything less would send a dangerous 
signal to other dictators around the 
world that wars of aggression could 
yield net gains. That must not happen. 
America and our allies must ensure 
that the only thing Putin gains from 
the invasion of Ukraine is a hard lesson 
learned through bitter defeat and loss. 
Let there be no mistake; that is the 
only outcome we can accept. 
The lend-lease bill we will pass today 
is 
a 
bipartisan 
expression 
of 
the 
House’s support for Ukraine and the 
continued provision of the lethal arms 
it requires to defend its freedom, its 
sovereignty, and its people. 
I thank, as I said earlier, Chairman 
GREGORY MEEKS, Ranking Member MI-
CHAEL
MCCAUL, Representative JOE 
WILSON, and staff members of the For-
eign Affairs Committee for their work 
on this bill. 
The Senate passed this legislation 
unanimously earlier this month. I urge 
my colleagues: This is not a partisan 
issue. This is about freedom. This is 
about democracy. This is about moral-
ity. This should not be an issue that is 
at all dividing the 435 of us who have 
the honor to serve in this body. 
Once this legislation is enacted, the 
Biden-Harris administration will have 
another tool to ensure that military 
aid reaches Ukraine quickly and effi-
ciently so that it can be deployed to 
the front lines and defend democracy. 
We owe freedom nothing less than that. 
The White House has already re-
quested additional funding for military 
and humanitarian aid, and the House 
will stand ready to take action once 
there is agreement on the path for-
ward. 
I tell Chairman MEEKS of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and I tell Chairman 
SMITH
of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, as soon as that is ready to 
move, I will move it as soon as it is 
possible. 
The White House has urgently re-
quested the resources that Ukraine 
needs. Can we do any less than that? In 
the meantime, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, as I said, 
unanimously. Let us show Vladimir 
Putin, let us show the dictators and 
autocrats of the world, let us show 
them what happens when democracy is 
attacked. 
Hitler 
thought 
when 
he 
took 
Sudetenland and the free world did lit-
tle that he could then go to Poland, 
and he could go to Russia, and he could 
go to Africa, and he could go to France, 
and he could go someplace else. 
The free world led by America must 
make it very clear that it will not 
stand for this, that America will be 
part of an extraordinary alliance of 
free nations, moral nations, who be-
lieve in law, not might makes right. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to unanimously and decisively 
approve this legislation. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. 
SPARTZ).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4597 
April 28, 2022 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Ukraine Democracy 
Defense Lend-Lease Act. 
Bureaucracy, as we all know, is an 
enemy in any crisis, so streamlining 
processes and improving speed and 
agility are extremely important. 
I just recently went to Ukraine 
twice, and I want to share with you the 
brutality of this war, the atrocities 
that happened to the civilian popu-
lation. It is very difficult to express in 
words. It is very disturbing. 
The strength and resiliency of the 
Ukraine people and their optimism are 
very inspiring to me as an American 
and inspiring to a lot of people around 
the world. 
I talked to one of the American re-
porter journalists, and he said: I have 
been reporting here for a while, and I 
can tell you, Ukrainians don’t even re-
alize how much they are like Ameri-
cans. 
I talked to one Ukrainian service-
member, who actually grew up in the 
Kharkiv area close to the Russian bor-
der, and he told me: You know what? I 
always thought that we would become 
brothers and sisters, but to tell you the 
truth, we are not brothers anymore. 
This is a different people. I look at 
them, and we are West, and they are 
East. They are barbaric and lost in the 
last century or before. 
I think it is very important for us to 
make sure that we support the Ukrain-
ian people in this war and fight for 
freedom to bring stability and inter-
national order back to try to defend 
this fight for freedom and defend Eu-
rope and all of us from further esca-
lation of this conflict. 
I think it is also important for us to 
add some oversight and make sure that 
we do have military to share to make 
sure that these processes do work. I 
truly believe this collaboration of our 
great United States of America and our 
great 
American 
people 
with 
the 
strength and resiliency of the Ukrain-
ian people will bring victory and peace 
back. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I 
thank the bipartisan collaboration on 
these issues and support of this Con-
gress and this body. It is very impor-
tant for us to be strong and stand to-
gether because this is a national secu-
rity issue that we need to have re-
solved. I truly believe our country, the 
greatest country in the world, is an in-
spiration for a lot of people, and we are 
going to defeat the enemies of freedom 
and democracy around the world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this bill. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, first, 
let me thank Representative SPARTZ. 
She traveled with me when we visited 
Poland, and I know she was recently 
over there. She has relatives, and I 
think we saw her with—I think it was 
her grandparent, who is in her nineties, 
on Easter Sunday, celebrating and 
standing with the Ukrainian people. I 
thank the gentlewoman for her support 
even though she isn’t a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, particu-
larly for standing up for justice. I 
thank her personally for that. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN), my friend and 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. I thank Mr. MEEKS 
for what he has done to bring this leg-
islation to fruition, as well as Mr. WIL-
SON. 
I rise and I stand where I stand be-
cause we should all stand together. I 
stand here because we are engaged in a 
war for the world, and Ukraine is the 
front line of democracy in this war. 
We cannot allow a ruthless, reckless, 
careless dictator to dictate the terms 
of engagement. The terms of engage-
ment for us will have to be set by us. 
Our President has said no boots on 
the ground. I agree, but that doesn’t 
mean that we can’t have planes in the 
air that Ukrainians will pilot. That 
doesn’t mean that we can’t have tanks 
on the ground with the Ukrainians 
manning them. It doesn’t mean that 
you can’t have torpedoes in the water 
that Ukrainians are going to fire. It 
simply means this: We have no choice. 
If we allow this to happen, what hap-
pens when some other dictator decides 
that he is going to threaten? 
I believe that this legislation is a 
continuation of what President Biden 
has said he would do. No boots on the 
ground. We provide the armaments; 
they provide the army. 
We are engaged in a war for the 
world. We must win. Ukraine must be 
victorious in this battle. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Mr. WILSON
from South 
Carolina, for his leadership on this ef-
fort. Of course, I have to thank my 
good friend, our chairman of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, GREG MEEKS, 
for his immense work for many weeks 
on trying to get this done and done in 
the right way. 
I rise in support of the Ukraine De-
mocracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. We 
have to thank two essential people for 
this 
concept. 
Winston 
Churchill 
thought up the idea of lend-lease. He 
talked his essential partner in the very 
special 
transatlantic 
relationship, 
FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, into 
this concept. Roosevelt sold it to the 
Congress, and it is a real moment in 
history that we are back on this House 
floor supporting lend-lease. 
Congress came together to arm Brit-
ain in the face of the blitz by the Nazis, 
but today, we find ourselves in a very 
similar situation with Putin system-
atically bombing and shelling the 
peaceful villages and cities of Ukraine, 
the Ukrainian people bravely defending 
their own sovereign land in the face of 
evil. 
When I was in Romania 2 weeks ago, 
the Prime Minister there described 
their fighting spirit as: The Ukrainian 
people fight with lions’ hearts. 
This bill will expedite the resources 
needed for Ukraine to defend them-
selves against Russia’s illegal, unwar-
ranted, and brutal war in Ukraine. 
In every single meeting with our 
Ukrainian friends, parliamentarians, 
ministers, citizens, and our own col-
leagues, the answer is: While they ap-
preciate the American response and the 
response of 30 other nations, they need 
weapons, and they need them now. 
In history, victory and defeat can 
come down to days and weeks, if not 
hours. There have been too many 
delays already in getting Ukraine the 
military equipment they need. 
That is why I am pleased to see that 
we are enacting this Churchillian idea, 
born in World War II, a strategy now 
that will set the foundation for victory 
in this war and the President’s author-
ity to get the weapons to the brave 
Ukrainians fighting for their own inde-
pendence and freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill. I 
thank the Members who worked on it 
so diligently. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL), a member of 
the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, to 
Mr. MEEKS and Mr. WILSON: Thank you 
for your hard work on this legislation. 
Now, the Lord works in strange ways. 
As you get older, you can list the ways. 
The country is closer together in a 
most weird way for a common objec-
tive. We speak of unity more now than 
we spoke of division 8 months ago. 
Russia is bombing hospitals—war 
crimes. Russian soldiers are violating 
women and murdering children. Russia 
is seeking the total destruction of 
Ukraine. 
Against all odds, Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people have pushed Russia 
back. Russia and Putin are losing. 
This war will not end soon. Putin is 
deranged and humiliated. The violence 
will only intensify. It is the responsi-
bility of our government and every sin-
gle American to support the Ukrainian 
people. 
Before Pearl Harbor, America en-
acted the Lend-Lease Act to keep de-
mocracy alive. Our legislation chan-
nels the same spirit and the same pur-
pose. In 1940, FDR awakened America’s 
arsenal of democracy. With it, we pre-
served freedom. 
With our action today, we reawaken 
that arsenal of democracy once more. 
We again are witnessing a conflict of 
civilization versus darkness, freedom 
versus tyranny. 
New Jersey’s Ninth District has one 
of the largest Ukrainian-American pop-
ulations in America. They cry out for 
help. We cry with them. The brave 
Ukrainian people have undaunted cour-
age. They must know America stands 
with them no matter what. 
God bless Ukraine, and God bless the 
United States of America. The Lord 
does work in strange ways.

H4598 
April 28, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
great State of Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), a dynamic Member of Congress. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and the manager, 
Mr. WILSON, who I have traveled with 
as well, and I know his heart. 
Madam Speaker, I rise and support 
the legislation, S. 3522, that will pro-
vide the President with the authority 
to lend and lease defense articles to be 
able to help in the fight. 
Madam Speaker, but as I do that, re-
alizing what we are standing for, I 
raise my button that says, ‘‘We Stand 
With Ukraine,’’ the very nation that is 
standing in the gap and fighting for the 
preservation of democracy around the 
world against the tyranny of autocracy 
and a one-man band and a one-man 
war. 
We have all heard of the atrocities 
that this violent dictator has chosen to 
wage against the innocent people of 
Ukraine, a country that wants nothing 
more than to love, to live, and to live 
under a democratic regime. But let me 
tell you the story of what they face 
every day. 
Mariupol, the people who are there 
under siege do not know whether or not 
the soldiers, the injured soldiers, civil-
ians, and children will ever come out 
alive. Or the mother who held her 3- 
month-old baby with her family mem-
bers in her own apartment, seeking ref-
uge and bombed by the Russians. 
Or the little girl, 16 years old, who 
was told to take off her clothes to be 
raped by a Russian soldier, and to be 
raped again and again. 
For the children who sat amongst the 
bodies of their parents, for the children 
who 
themselves 
were 
killed 
in 
Mariupol and around the nation, for 
those who lost loved ones who are flee-
ing through universal humanitarian 
routes that are known in every war. 
I recall, as a Member of the United 
States Congress, going to the Bosnian 
War, Albanian Civil War, Iraq, Afghani-
stan. I don’t think I have ever seen a 
direct and deliberate attack on civil-
ians as Vladimir Putin’s war has done. 
So this is a crucial moment in our 
history. We have our responsibilities to 
America. We have the responsibilities 
of securing the southern border. I just 
spent hours in the Committee on the 
Judiciary where my friends on the 
other side of the aisle decided to take 
up one issue, the attack about title 42. 
On this floor, just a few hours ago, 
there was a constant rampant voice of 
title 42 regarding the southern border 
when we were discussing this bill under 
the rule. 
I want the American people to know 
that talk is cheap, and what we should 
be doing now is realizing that this is 
serious business. We must pass this leg-
islation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman is extremely kind for 
the passion that I have. 
Madam Speaker, we must pass this 
legislation to deal with not only the 
lend-lease on defense articles, but to be 
able to provide the necessary humani-
tarian relief as well. 
Madam Speaker, I conclude my re-
marks by saying that the children have 
to be prioritized. When I was in 
Ukraine on the border and visiting a 
reception center, I saw the faces of the 
children. 
Unaccompanied 
children 
should be registered. Children with par-
ents should be registered. We should be 
focused, as UNICEF says, to eliminate 
the nightmare that the children are 
facing, the death that they face, the in-
jury that they face, and to prioritize it 
and to make sure that children can 
face the trauma that this war is. 
As we do that, let us continue to bol-
ster up the American people’s support 
and let us address their needs, because 
they have needs, but let us make sure 
that the victory is ours. 
Finally, I am grateful for one of our 
hostages coming home; he lives in 
Texas. There are two more that we 
know that are well-known, and we 
must bring home both of them, includ-
ing the Olympian that plays in Russia 
and who is a WNBA star. We must 
bring them home. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation and ask all my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from the 
great State of Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support 
this important legislation that Con-
gressman WILSON and I have cospon-
sored. We have had bipartisan support 
on this legislation as well. 
It is important that we support 
Ukraine in every way possible. Amer-
ica does not have to give up its blood 
from our soldiers in this war, we only 
have to give our treasure. What a bar-
gain that is for America. We supply 
and help Ukrainians fight the Rus-
sians. Putin sees this as a war against 
America and the West. We are fortu-
nate. Eventually, it would come to 
NATO lands, and it will be our blood, 
not just our treasure that we would 
have to give. 
The Ukrainians are doing a great job, 
but they need our help and support. I 
hope they get airplanes, too. Every 
bomb that falls on the people in the 
hospitals and kills innocent lives could 
be prevented, and we should try to do 
all we can to prevent it. 
Madam Speaker, I met today with 
the President of Georgia. I met with 
the President of Kosovo. They both are 
concerned that Putin’s got his eyes on 
their countries as well. And he does. He 
is looking at the Balkans. He is look-
ing at the Baltic, where I visited Lith-
uania. I have been to Estonia and Lat-
via; he desires those countries, too. He 
wants to put together a repeat of what 
they had as the great Russian empire. 
And he won’t be stopped unless we do 
it. If we can do it with Ukrainian men 
and women fighting, we are lucky and 
we are fortunate, and we should do all 
we can to help them. 
Putin is a bully, and you don’t stop a 
bully with kindness and negotiations. 
You have to stand up to that person. 
Stand up to the bully. That is the only 
thing they understand and respect. 
We need to continue our sanctions 
and sanction him into oblivion. We 
need to support Ukraine or else this 
war will go on and America will be at 
risk 
of 
being 
personally 
involved. 
Ukraine 
is 
the 
battleground 
now. 
America will be next through NATO 
and other efforts of Putin. 
Glory to Ukraine. Glory to the 
United States of America. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the very distinguished 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair. 
We shall pay any price, we shall bear any 
burden, we shall support any friend, oppose 
any foe, to assure the survival and the suc-
cess of liberty. 
President Kennedy’s inaugural ad-
dress. 
And here we stand in the most power-
ful country, in the most powerful legis-
lative body, voting on an issue of free-
dom, of liberty, the basic foundation of 
this country. I am proud that this is a 
bipartisan 
effort 
to 
support 
the 
Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian 
leadership because they have paid the 
ultimate sacrifice. They are bearing 
the ultimate burden. 
So it is appropriate for us, as this 
monster, Vladimir Putin, invades a 
free country, blackmails the neighbors 
around energy issues, scares all of 
Eastern Europe and all of Europe, in 
conjunction with the support of China 
who looked the other way and said, 
Well, just wait until after the Olym-
pics. There is a lot at stake here. 
This is about much more than just 
Ukraine. This is about freedom around 
the world. 
I agree with what the chairman and 
so many other speakers said. We can-
not let Vladimir Putin gain one inch of 
soil in Ukraine. Not one inch. You 
can’t reward bad behavior. You can’t 
reward violence. And that is what we 
will be doing. 
So I rise in support of this bill. I sup-
port the $33 billion that the President 
has proposed this morning. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 1 minute.

H4599 
April 28, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, we need 
to continue this process; not one inch 
of soil. 
Like Mr. PASCRELL said, there are 
States like New Jersey or Ohio, where 
we have people from Ukraine and from 
Poland and from Lithuania, and those 
ties run deep. Their family members, 
friends that they have lost, that have 
gotten killed, slaughtered by a mon-
ster. 
So we need to keep going. 
Planes: The $33 billion that the Presi-
dent wants, this process expedites all 
that. 
We should look at what we need to do 
to China if they continue to support 
Russia in this effort. 
I think, in a bipartisan way, we need 
to come together around a whole-of- 
government approach. 
We need to get natural gas from east-
ern Ohio to Eastern Europe, from west-
ern Pennsylvania to Eastern Europe, 
from West Virginia and New York to 
Eastern Europe, and knock the legs out 
from under Vladimir Putin. 
Whole-of-government approach. Be 
aggressive. Not one inch of territory. 
And make sure we ensure the survival 
and the success of liberty. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is impor-
tant to note that S. 3522 is a smart and 
critical step to give another piece of 
artillery to the administration so that 
it has flexibility as it needs to provide 
Ukraine the support that it needs so 
that it has the ability to win. 
It is also important to show, and that 
is why it is important for us to be on 
the floor today, as Mr. WILSON has indi-
cated, the unity that we have here in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
Madam Speaker, I will tell you that 
working with Mr. MCCAUL and Mr. WIL-
SON and Mrs. SPARTZ on the other side 
of the aisle, as well as with all of my 
colleagues on the committee on the 
Democratic side of the aisle, and work-
ing with the Speaker and the majority 
leader, it is that unity that is going to 
win this war. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time, and I am very 
grateful that next we will have the 
Speaker of the House. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
great 
Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank the distinguished Mr. WILSON 
for yielding as well. 
Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that 
this legislation has such strong bipar-
tisan support on the floor of the House. 
It removes all doubt in anyone’s mind 
that we are all committed as a Nation, 
as a Congress—House and Senate—in 
terms of this legislation. I thank both 
gentlemen for their leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate that 
the gentleman is working with the 
ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, on this 
important issue as well, and I thank 
him for affording me this opportunity 
today. 
Madam Speaker, 81 years ago, Presi-
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt came 
here to the Congress of the United 
States, to the House of Representa-
tives, where I am proud to say my fa-
ther, Thomas D’Alesandro, served as a 
Member of Congress. And President 
Franklin Roosevelt delivered a bold 
and historic request. 
In his 1941 State of the Union Ad-
dress, President Roosevelt explained 
that democracy itself was under dire 
threat not only in Europe, but around 
the world. And he called on Congress to 
lend a hand to our Allies overseas, bol-
stering their defenses so they could de-
feat the evils of fascism. 
b 1530 
It was this initiative that would be 
enacted just two months later that un-
deniably turned the tide of the Second 
World War. And the Lend-Lease pro-
gram would help propel the allies to a 
victory that preserved the promise of 
democracy for generations to come. 
Today, we see an echo of that chapter 
in history as a murderous tyrant seeks 
to conquer its neighbor and dismantle 
its democracy. And this moment de-
mands we summon a commitment to 
respond. 
The 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this piv-
otal program, waiving time-consuming 
requirements and the President au-
thority to send critical defensive re-
sources to Ukraine. 
It is important to note that it is 
about time. Time is very important 
when lives are at stake. 
In doing so, we enable the adminis-
tration to move faster to bolster 
Ukraine’s security forces, empowering 
them to repel the Russian invaders; 
protect innocent civilians; and preserve 
their cherished democracy. 
As war rages on Ukraine, every 
minute matters. It is about time. This 
strong action could mean the dif-
ference between lives saved and lives 
lost. In any given battle, it could mean 
the margin between victory and defeat. 
It is with astonishing unity that the 
Senate sent us this important legisla-
tion after passing it with a unanimous 
vote. 
And as we hope to secure a strong bi-
partisan vote here in the House, let us 
salute the leaders of this legislation, 
Chairman GREGORY MEEKS, chair of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. He 
acknowledged his ranking member, Mr. 
MCCAUL from Texas; Congressman JOE 
WILSON of South Carolina, who is man-
aging the bill on the Republican side 
today; and Congressman STEVE COHEN, 
who helms the Helsinki Commission 
and played a role in this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, restoring the Lend- 
Lease authority is just the latest ac-
tion proudly taken by this Congress to 
strengthen Ukraine and to decimate 
Russia. We have delivered billions in 
humanitarian security and economic 
assistance for Ukraine, including the 
$13.6 billion in the latest supplemental, 
and more to come, as our President has 
put forth a request earlier today that 
we will turn into legislation, turn into 
support democracy in Ukraine and, 
therefore, democracy in the world. I sa-
lute the President for his leadership. 
These resources are already—of the 
$13.6 billion, are already reaching com-
munities on the ground and helping 
Ukraine repel Russian forces. But we 
need to do more. 
As we prepare to take up the Presi-
dent’s new supplemental request, we 
are moving in lockstep with the admin-
istration and our allies to isolate Rus-
sia and devastate its economy. 
From severing normal trade relations 
to banning the import of Russian en-
ergy, our strong actions in the House 
and in the Senate have made Russia 
weaker in every way. And the House 
took its first steps to prosecute Rus-
sian war crimes so the perpetrators can 
be held accountable for the unthink-
able, grotesque, diabolical atrocities. 
Later today, with the blessing of the 
Embassy of Ukraine, we will unveil in 
the Speaker’s Dining Room—and we in-
vite our Members to come and their 
guests—a photo exhibit that captures 
many of these atrocities. 
These haunting photographs show 
the horror and heartbreak of Russia’s 
callous aggression of Ukraine, and 
serve as an important reminder of our 
moral duty to continue to take swift, 
decisive action to help. 
Going back to Lend-Lease, upon the 
enactment of the historic Lend-Lease 
law in March of 1941, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt called upon the conscience of 
our country when he declared: ‘‘The 
light of democracy must be kept burn-
ing. It is not enough for us merely to 
trim the wick or polish the glass. The 
time has come when we must provide 
the fuel in an ever-increasing amount 
to keep the flame alive.’’ 
Madam Speaker, our task today re-
mains the same. 
I do want to acknowledge also an-
other item, and I thank Mr. Chairman 
and others for their support of this. We 
are doing Lend-Lease today. We talked 
about what we did in the omnibus bill, 
the supplemental, $13.6 billion. 
We talked about severing our pur-
chase of oil. We have talked about sev-
ering our normal trade relations. But 
we also did something yesterday when 
we did what I call ‘‘seize and freeze.’’ 
Seize the assets of the oligarchs and 
the Russians, that money, and freeze 
it. And when it thaws, to use that 
money to help rebuild Ukraine after 
the victory over the Russians. 
So, again, we are thinking of what we 
need to do in humanitarian assistance;

what we need to do in economic assist-
ance; what we must do in security as-
sistance, weapons, et cetera. But we 
have to do some other aspects as well. 
Our task today, again, remains the 
same as it did with the original Lend- 
Lease. Make no mistake. Russia in-
vaded with the stated goal of ending 
liberty and self-governance in Ukraine. 
Yet, with unimaginable courage and 
determination, the Ukrainian people 
are putting their lives on the line for 
democracy; not only for their own na-
tion, but for democracy writ large for 
the world. 
It is about freedom versus dictator-
ship; autocracy versus democracy. The 
Ukrainian people are making the fight 
for all of us. We must help them. 
So, it is our duty to honor their her-
oism at the front lines of the battle for 
freedom by helping to fuel this right-
eous fight. 
It is with endless admiration for the 
Ukrainian people and their leadership, 
President—just 
everybody. 
I 
won’t 
start naming names. All of them. We 
have had visits from so many of them— 
and their unyielding commitment to 
keeping alight democracy’s precious 
flame that I urge a strong, bipartisan 
‘‘aye’’ vote for this vital legislation. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague. And 
thank you, Madam Speaker, for your 
statements. I agree wholeheartedly 
with you. 
America is having a fight undertaken 
for us by the Ukrainian forces. Ukraine 
is fighting for liberty around the world. 
It is fighting for freedom-loving coun-
tries that want to push back against 
aggression from any nation, whether it 
be Russia or China or any other that 
would attempt to take away liberties 
from free citizens. 
I just returned from Ukraine Tuesday 
night. I spent the Easter weekend in 
Ukraine. I had the unbelievable privi-
lege of speaking in two churches. Irpin, 
where the city had been impacted by 
missiles and bombs, homes blown up, 
lives taken; and a church that had not 
met since the beginning of war met on 
Easter, Resurrection Sunday. 
And I looked at the faces of the peo-
ple thinking, How do I speak to them? 
An American Member of Congress, who 
lives freely, without nations trying to 
take our freedom away. And I could 
only respond to them from the one who 
gave freedom, His words, Jesus himself. 
And I looked at the faces of the peo-
ple, and there was resolve there, and 
there was a joy that they were doing 
what was necessary to promote free-
dom for their land. 
I spoke in another church in Kyiv 
that afternoon. The same viewpoint on 
the faces of those citizens. And yet, a 
great appreciation for America, for 
their Western allies, for what we have 
done, thus far, to stand with them. 
They are fighting for us as well as for 
themselves. 
Later that afternoon, I went out to 
the Bucha region, and I saw the site of 
a massive undertaking by Russia to 
cross the river to bring their tanks in 
to take over Kyiv. And the amazing 
forces of the citizens themselves fought 
back. One hundred Ukrainian lives 
were lost; 500 Russian lives. 
I saw a boot laying there of a Russian 
soldier with the foot still in it. And I 
came to understand that Ukrainians 
aren’t killing Russians, Putin is. 
America needs to stand. I was in 
Odesa, and I saw the missile strike on 
an apartment that took the lives of a 
grandmother, her daughter, and a little 
baby, the 3-month-old daughter of that 
young lady. 
I talked to the mayor of Odesa. They 
are standing firm. The blockade that is 
on there must be taken away so they 
can feed the world. 
In my pocket I carry an emblem, 
military emblem that was given to me 
at Hostomel airfield that the brave 
forces took on Russia, trying to take 
that airfield to become a hopping off 
point for all of their action. They held 
back Russia’s troops; their elite troops; 
their elite marines. 
The Russian troops took out the larg-
est aircraft in the world that was only 
used for humanitarian reasons. 
This bill is necessary. I express ap-
preciation to my colleagues for moving 
it forward. I express appreciation to 
our Speaker for moving it forward. It 
needs to be done. 
Stand with Ukraine. They have stood 
with us. 
God bless Ukraine. God bless Amer-
ica. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time at this 
time, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, this bill 
calls on the administration to supply 
the defense articles needed to defeat 
war criminal Putin’s forces, and for the 
land of Ukraine to be returned to its 
rightful and lawful inhabitants, the 
courageous people of Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian fight is a fight of free-
dom-loving people around the world. 
This is part of authoritarianism, which 
is rule of gun opposing democracy, rule 
of law. 
America 
stands 
with 
President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, with 
President Salome Zourabichvili of the 
Republic of Georgia, President Maia 
Sandu of Moldova, and with the right-
ful 
President, 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, of Belarus. 
Additionally, as we are discussing 
Lend-Lease, I had the extraordinary 
opportunity with Congresswoman Mad-
eleine Bordallo in 2005, to visit, sadly, 
the world’s largest open cemetery in 
Saint Petersburg, the victims, half a 
million people of the siege of Lenin-
grad. And we were there to show the 
love and affection of the United States 
to the people of Russia. 
We were there to also find out that it 
was American Lend-Lease equipment 
that provided for the defeat of Hitler 
and for the saving, actually, of the 
Putin family. And so, Lend-Lease has a 
long proud history of providing for 
freedom successfully. 
In December, I visited the courageous 
Ukrainian patriots in Kyiv. I am con-
fident Ukraine will win for freedom and 
independence. We are all inspired by 
the 
Ukrainian-American 
Congress-
woman VICTORIA
SPARTZ
of Indiana, 
and over a million dynamic Ukrainian 
Americans who are successful across 
America. 
I urge all Members to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, as we stand here 
right now, in the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Secretary Antony Blinken 
is testifying and talking about his re-
cent visit to Kyiv, asking—well, reply-
ing to questions that Members on both 
sides are asking. 
And the sense of unity that has been 
talked about here today, about us 
being united against Putin’s aggres-
sion, about us standing together and 
trying to make sure that we do all that 
we can to help the Ukrainian people, 
and that unity, that unity, is what is 
going to make sure that we preserve 
democracies around the world. 
b 1545 
It is the unity that we have seen with 
the United States in the lead, keeping 
30 NATO countries together, which no 
one thought would happen before this 
incursion. 
It is the unity of bringing our Asian 
allies together. It is the unity bringing 
our Western Hemisphere allies to-
gether. It is the unity bringing our Af-
rican allies together. 
It is that unity right here in the 
United States Congress. Working to-
gether is what is going to prevail. 
There was a question asked before I 
left the hearing. One Member said he 
was at a townhall meeting, and some-
one asked the question: Well, what 
does this mean to me? That was the 
question. 
Secretary Blinken said, with which I 
agree: What does it mean? Well, when 
you look at what is at stake, number 
one, the world is asking: What hap-
pens? Are there any consequences for a 
country that decides just to go invade 
someone else’s sovereign property? If 
we allow that to happen, if it could 
happen there, it could happen any-
where. 
The questions of what we do, what we 
stand for, who we are, and what our 
values are, are on the line right now, 
not only in Ukraine but for all of us 
who believe in democracy. 
When you look at the consequences 
and the lack of care of the rest of the 
world by this invasion by Mr. Putin— 
we are going to have to do hearings

now to talk about starvation. People 
around the world will starve because of 
the lack of wheat. 
We are looking at what he tried to 
utilize with reference to energy re-
sources. It has a reverberation back 
here in the United States as we are 
looking at what is taking place with 
rising oil costs, with rising food costs. 
This is about us around the world, 
some, yes, making sacrifices so that we 
can show the world that unity. And to-
gether, we will prevent evil from occur-
ring. 
We have seen it once in the 1940s. I 
never thought I would have to see and 
fight it again in 2022. This is a trying 
time for the camera of history, which 
is rolling. 
I, again, thank Mr. MCCAUL because I 
have been working very closely with 
my ranking member to make sure that 
we have one voice on this. We have 
talked often and made sure that we are 
working in a bipartisan manner. I 
thank Mr. WILSON for managing this 
bill on the floor and working collec-
tively together in that regard. I thank 
the leadership on both sides of the aisle 
because with that, Ukraine will win. 
When Ukraine wins, the American 
people win; the world wins; democracy 
wins. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1065, 
the previous question is ordered on the

The question is on the third reading

The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, and was read the third

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4602 
April 28, 2022 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, today 
I come before the House of Representa-
tives to honor and recognize the sac-
rifice of Sergeant Bishop Evans of the 
Texas National Guard, age 22, of Ar-
lington, Texas. 
Sergeant Evans gave his life to save 
two others. He exemplifies the spirit of 
service and sacrifice that those who 
volunteer to serve in our Nation’s mili-
tary personify. 
He died an American hero. He was a 
light in times of darkness. May God 
bless his family. 
Madam Speaker, at this time I re-
quest a moment of silence to honor the 
life of Sergeant Bishop Evans.

CELEBRATING PASTOR WILLIAMS’ 
11TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
AT 
ZION 
HILL BAPTIST CHURCH 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to praise a great man of faith, 
Pastor Douglas L. Williams, III. 
For the last 11 years he has been the 
pastor at Zion Hill Baptist Church in 
Newark, New Jersey. 
In that time, he has done tremendous 
work to help his community. He was a 
strong supporter of vaccinations to 
protect members and residents from 
COVID–19. He worked to provide social 
services to people who were suffering 
due to COVID–19-related job losses and 
other hardships. 
His goal as the pastor of Zion Hill 
has been to love people and grow an ac-
tive community church, and he has 
done that. 
I had the honor of attending his in-
stallation 11 years ago along with my 
father, the late Congressman DONALD 
PAYNE, Jr., as I was a city councilman 
at the time. And recently to celebrate 
the 11 incredible years he has given as 
the head of Zion Hill. I can say, he is 
truly succeeding in his goal. 
So congratulations again to Pastor 
Douglas L. Williams, III, on 11 excep-
tional years as the pastor of my neigh-
bors, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, from 
across the street, who for 60 years have 
gone to that church, and also for the 
rest of the congregation at Zion Hill 
Baptist Church. 
He is truly a man of faith who is a 
blessing to our community. 
f 
TAX DAY 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Monday 
of last week was liberals’ favorite holi-
day: Tax Day—which usually serves as 
an annual reminder of just how big the 
government has gotten. 
However, instead of paying taxes on 
only one day of the year, Americans 
are being forced to pay an invisible tax 
every day this year: inflation—which is 
a constant reminder of the cost of Big 
Government and big deficit spending. 
Make no mistake, President Biden’s 
and congressional Democrats’ willing-
ness to borrow trillions of dollars to 
pay for ever-growing wasteful govern-
ment programs has caused record-high 
inflation. Prices at the pump and at 
the grocery store were already sky-
rocketing well before Vladimir Putin’s 
evil invasion of Ukraine. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion wants to double down on these dis-
astrous, 
inflation-inducing 
spending 
bills. His budget proposal calls for 
shelling out $73 trillion over the next 
10 years and would only add to the pain 
we all feel when we reach for our pock-
etbooks. Tennesseans can’t afford an-
other year of one-party Democratic 
control of Government.

HONORING VIVIAN FAHR 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a constituent, Ms. Viv-
ian Fahr, who recently completed her 
GED at the age of 88. 
After completing the 10th grade, Viv-
ian left school and got married. From 
that point on, she never stopped work-
ing hard to raise four kids, pay the 
bills, and put food on the table. One 
day, she remarked to her daughter-in- 
law that she regretted never having 
had the chance to finish her education. 
Vivian’s family connected her to 
ProJeCt of Easton, an outstanding 
interfaith coalition in my district that 
provides free educational programs to 
members of the community. With the 
organization’s help, Vivian started her 
coursework at age 87 and diligently 
worked to obtain her degree, always at-
tending class, participating, and asking 
for assistance when needed. 
Vivian is an inspiration to her chil-
dren, her grandchildren, the greater 
Lehigh Valley community, and stu-
dents of all ages. She is a testament to 
the importance of high-quality edu-
cation. 
Congratulations, Vivian. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ SOFT-ON-CRIME 
POLICIES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
crime is soaring under President Biden 
and the Democrats’ soft-on-crime poli-
cies nationally and in my home State 
of California. 
More police officers were killed in 
the line of duty in 2021 than in any 
year since 1995. Last year, over a dozen 
U.S. cities set new homicide records. 
Shootings of police officers have in-
creased 63 percent compared to this 
time in 2020. 
Instead of addressing these deadly 
statistics, some Democrats in blue cit-
ies want to defund and demonize our 
police. 
Instead of focusing on dangerous in-
dividuals with illegal weapons who 
commit these deadly crimes, President 
Biden has chosen to attack law-abiding 
Americans 
exercising 
their 
Second 
Amendment rights. He wants the ATF 
to ban privately made firearms, so- 
called ghost guns, which are predomi-
nantly a hobbyist option and require 
more time, tooling, and dedication to 
craftsmanship than most criminals are 
willing to invest. 
Instead of throwing the books at 
criminals, they are coming after pri-
vate citizens, even going so far as to 
call parents at school board meetings 
terrorists. 
Now, they want to introduce legisla-
tion that would target law enforcement 
and servicemembers as potential do-
mestic terrorists. This is deeply offen-
sive to our men and women in uniform 
and also goes against evidence that ter-
rorist incidents are far more likely to 
be committed against military and law 
enforcement than by military and law 
enforcement. 
This is wrongheaded, and we must 
stop this. 
f 
THANKING FIREFIGHTERS AND 
FIRST RESPONDERS 
(Ms. STANSBURY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to thank our brave fire-
fighters and first responders who are 
on the front lines, saving lives as 
wildfires burn across the beautiful 
State of New Mexico. 
This week began with 20 wildfires 
burning across 16 counties of our State, 
causing thousands of New Mexicans to 
evacuate their homes. We mourn the 
lives that have been lost and stand in 
solidarity with the many families who 
have been forced to leave, in many 
cases, lands on which they have lived 
on for generations. 
As we lift up our firefighters and first 
responders, I thank our Governor, Gov-
ernor Lujan Grisham, for her leader-
ship in the face of these devastating 
fires. Her quick response has saved 
lives, and I want to echo her call for 
additional support to coordinate emer-
gency response across the State. 
These wildfires show us why our 
votes in this body are so important, as 
we are sending more than $5.5 billion to 
prevent and fight wildfires through the 
bipartisan infrastructure law and other 
bills we have passed. 
As wildfires continue to burn across 
our State, we stand ready to support 
our Governor, local officials, 
fire-
fighters, and everyone helping out. To-
gether, as New Mexicans, we stand 
shoulder to shoulder in solidarity and 
in support of our communities.

FAILED BORDER POLICIES 
THREATENING AMERICA 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, upon returning to my office, 
I heard testimony from Secretary 
Mayorkas from Homeland Security 
saying that he inherited a mess at the 
border and that he is doing the best he 
can. 
The American public ought to know 
what the numbers are. Two Marches 
ago, between got-aways who weren’t 
vetted by the Border Patrol and people 
who were vetted by the Border Patrol, 
about 11,000 people a month were com-
ing here. A year ago in March, it was 
around 60,000. We are right now at 
153,000. 
When you inherit a March with 11,000 
and 2 years later you are at 153,000, you 
have not been doing the best you can. 
This is threatening the end of Amer-
ica. It signals that America is very 
weak. I have felt all along the policies 
at the southern border are one of the 
reasons we have to deal with Ukraine 
right now, because no normal leader 
would allow this many people to cross 
the border. 
In any event, I urge my colleagues, 
anybody who has the ear of Secretary 
Mayorkas or the President, to point 
out that when you go from 11,000 to 
153,000 people a month in 2 years cross-
ing the border, you have failed and 
something has to be done. 
f 
RISING COSTS OF HOUSING 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to the in-
creased cost of building materials, cre-
ating an affordability crisis for housing 
in America. 
This is, in part, because the COVID– 
19 pandemic has played a significant 
role in harming our country’s supply of 
lumber and building materials. In addi-
tion, tariffs with Canada, along with 
long-term reductions of domestic tim-
ber harvesting, have exacerbated the 
price increases. 
According to the National Associa-
tion of Home Builders, prices of mate-
rials to build houses, like oriented 
strand boards, are up more than 400 
percent since last spring. The average 
price of lumber has quadrupled. 
This supply cost has increased the 
price of a new house, a new single-fam-
ily home, by nearly $40,000 per unit. 
I urge Congress and the Biden admin-
istration to take action to address the 
lumber supply chain, such as increas-
ing domestic harvesting of timber and 
negotiating new lumber agreements 
with Canada. This is a way we can ef-
fectively reduce the cost of housing. 
We need to build more housing. 
CONGRATULATING TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR KURT RUSSELL 
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to offer my heartfelt congratulations 
to the 2022 National Teacher of the 
Year, Kurt Russell. 
Mr. Russell teaches at Oberlin High 
School in Oberlin, Ohio. He is a 25-year 
veteran of the classroom. 
Kurt Russell was first inspired to be-
come a teacher in middle school when 
he encountered his first Black male 
teacher. 
In addition to his classroom and ex-
tracurricular duties, Kurt is the head 
coach for the school’s varsity basket-
ball team. He sees basketball as an ex-
tension of the classroom and a place 
where young people can learn about 
working together and how to handle 
both adversity and success. 
He provides an inclusive and safe en-
vironment for studying diverse groups 
and encouraging all students’ voices to 
be heard. 
Now, as the 2022 National Teacher of 
the Year, he plans to advocate for 
classrooms to better reflect the stu-
dents within them. 
Mr. Russell joins his cohort of Na-
tional Teachers of the Year from every 
State and territory this week in Wash-
ington, D.C., to celebrate their achieve-
ment, the profession, and their dedica-
tion to students. 
As a fellow National Teacher of the 
Year, I offer my heartfelt congratula-
tions to the entire cohort and all the 
teachers who are being recognized this 
week.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ELLZEY). 
RECOGNIZING MIDLOTHIAN INNOVATIVE 
LEARNING EXPERIENCE 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I 
come before the House of Representa-
tives to recognize the Midlothian Inno-
vative Learning Experience, or MILE, 
as the nonprofit of the year in 2021 for 
the city of Midlothian, Texas. 
This is a state-of-the-art educational 
facility that is providing high school 
students with additional learning path-
ways throughout the community. Non-
profits are a fundamental part of 
America, and I thank Midlothian Inno-
vative Learning Experience for their 
dedication to teaching the future gen-
eration. 
It is important that we bring aware-
ness to career and technical education 
so that people can learn about many 
different professions at a younger age. 
Career and technical education is a 
perfect way for students to apply what 
they are taught in school to a real- 
world environment. 
MILE offers five career and technical 
education pathways: culinary arts, en-
trepreneurship, civil engineering, aero-
space engineering, and cybersecurity. 
These programs provide students the 
opportunity to utilize industry-stand-
ard equipment and practices they have 
shown an interest in. 
This unique learning space is able to 
replicate scenarios found in a profes-
sional, real-world working atmosphere. 
With the support from industry profes-
sionals, MILE is able to thrive and 
partner with Midlothian Independent 
School District. 
It is an honor to represent this group 
of mentors who help contribute to the 
outstanding education found all around 
Texas’ Sixth District. I thank them for 
all they do. 
RECOGNIZING ORISE KOPNAK ON HER 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Orise Kopnak, who 
just celebrated her 100th birthday. 
Twice a week, this Waxahachie, 
Texas, resident volunteers at Baylor 
Scott & White hospital to volunteer in 
the day surgery department waiting 
room. Since 2014, she has logged more 
than 2,400 hours of her personal time to 
encourage, serve, and assist people who 
are waiting for a loved one to come out 
of surgery. 
Orise’s faithfulness to stand with the 
families, friends, and caregivers of pa-
tients during anxious and often dif-
ficult circumstances is a testament to 
her character. Even during a pandemic, 
Orise continued to volunteer. 
People like Orise Kopnak represent 
everything that is good about our 
country. America was built on the vol-
unteer principle. It has been instru-
mental in our Nation’s advancement 
and made us, as Americans, a strong 
and self-reliant people. 
Ronald Reagan once said the volun-
teer spirit is the engine that drives the 
whole history of the United States. It 
is an extra dimension of faith, friend-
ship, and brotherhood that makes us 
good neighbors and good people and 
made America a great country. 
I thank Orise for showing us how it is 
done. There is a reason her generation 
has been dubbed the Greatest Genera-
tion. May God bless her as she con-
tinues to carry out one of life’s great-
est causes: serving others. 
RECOGNIZING DEMOND DAVIS 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I take 
this time to recognize one of my con-
stituents, Ellis County Sheriff’s Dep-
uty Demond Davis. 
Deputy Davis was new to the sheriff’s 
force when he responded to a 10–200, 
which is a drug-related incident. Once 
he arrived, he witnessed a drug over-
dose. The individual was struggling, 
barely breathing, and his conditions 
were intensifying. Deputy Davis rushed 
to 
help 
and 
quickly 
administered 
Narcan nasal spray.

According to the account, the indi-
vidual immediately started coming to. 
They were transported to Baylor Scott 
& 
White 
Medical 
Center 
in 
Waxahachie, where they received addi-
tional medical attention. 
Deputy Davis’ actions ensured an-
other person did not fall victim to the 
opioid epidemic. Ellis County Sheriff 
Brad Norman awarded the Life-Saving 
Award commendation and pin to Dep-
uty Davis for his heroic actions. 
Drug 
overdoses, 
especially 
from 
fentanyl, have become more prevalent 
in the U.S. Deputy Davis and his fellow 
law enforcement officers are our front 
line in responding to this terrible cri-
sis. We cannot thank our law enforce-
ment and first responders enough. 
America needs more heroes like Dep-
uty Demond Davis. 
CONGRATULATING TIMOTHY REDHAIR 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor and congratulate a resident of 
Waxahachie, Texas, Timothy Redhair, 
who was promoted to the rank of colo-
nel in the U.S. Army Reserve this 
month. 
Colonel Redhair has a long and dis-
tinguished career in the military while 
also being a steward of our community. 
As a lieutenant colonel, he com-
manded the 2nd Battalion, 132nd Infan-
try Regiment of the Texas Army Na-
tional Guard and later had the oppor-
tunity to lead the Headquarters Bat-
talion of the Texas Army National 
Guard’s 36th Infantry Division. 
During the height of the pandemic, 
Colonel Redhair deployed with his divi-
sion to Kuwait. After returning from 
the Middle East, Timothy joined the 
Army Reserve, where he serves as the 
emergency preparedness liaison officer 
for Texas. 
When Colonel Redhair isn’t pro-
tecting our community, he spends his 
time as an assistant Scoutmaster for 
Troop 520, Circle Ten Council of the 
Boy Scouts of America, where he trains 
young men and women to become our 
future leaders. 
This commitment to our country and 
our community is outstanding, and I 
am glad to see such a worthy member 
of our community receive this honor. 
I thank Colonel Redhair again for his 
service and congratulate him on his 
well-deserved promotion.

IN SUPPORT OF UKRAINE 
Mr. ELLZEY. It has been over 2 
months since Russia invaded Ukraine. 
We are witnessing a war crime forced 
upon the people of Ukraine. 
But from this tragedy we have seen 
great strength from the Ukrainian peo-
ple, as well as a great deal of kindness 
and support from our fellow Ameri-
cans. 
In fact, throughout Texas District 
Six, you will see support with Ukrain-
ian flags being flown and people donat-
ing their time to help the people of 
Ukraine. For example, Waxahachie’s 
very own Gregg Burdette went with a 
nine-person team from Texas Baptist 
Men to assist with Ukrainian refugees 
in Poland. 
Gregg’s team spent 10 days volun-
teering in shelters and receiving and 
sorting donated materials. With volun-
teers from all over the world, they 
were able to help many families and 
children get food, supplies, and a good 
night’s rest. 
Gregg is not the only District Six na-
tive giving aid to Ukraine. Surepoint 
Medical Centers, a local free-standing 
emergency room chain based out of 
Mansfield, Texas, donated their own 
medical supplies to aid the people of 
Ukraine. 
With the help of many District Six 
residents who work for Surepoint, they 
were able to send critical medical sup-
plies that included tourniquets, ban-
dages, and various other lifesaving 
items. 
I am proud of the work and kindness 
not just from the people of District 
Six, but everyone else who has donated 
any time, supplies, or sent prayers to 
the Ukrainian people in their time of 
need. 
My friend from Arizona, I appreciate 
you yielding me time. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I am going to do something this 
evening that isn’t sort of traditional 
for me because I mostly do economics. 
I tried to do that circle of how every-
thing ties together, and I accept I get 
a little geeky. For those who are try-
ing to keep an eye on the history of our 
words, wave at me if I start speaking 
too fast because I have had a lot of cof-
fee today. 
Today, I am going to try to talk 
about what I saw on the border last 
week, but I am going to try to do it in 
a slightly different way. You have had 
lots of us come up here—and I am 
going to do part of it; I am going to 
show the boards and the numbers and 
all that. 
In economics, there is this concept of 
a second-degree effect, a third-degree 
effect. I wish I could come up with a 
definition for a misery effect. The fact 
of the matter is, let’s pretend it is real-
ly done out of compassion. Let’s pre-
tend our brothers and sisters on the 
left, this administration, their ap-
proach to the border is because they 
are heartfelt, and they believe this is 
kind and compassionate. My argument 
here is going to be really simple: 
Please think through your definition of 
‘‘compassion.’’ 
Now that we know there are func-
tionally 700 migrants who have lost 
their lives trying to cross the river, or 
when I was with the Border Patrol last 
Wednesday in Yuma, Arizona, and the 
Border Patrol agent, she was telling 
me of the heartbreak of finding a cou-
ple of children dead in the desert just a 
few hundred yards from the border, 
how can that be our definition of ‘‘com-
passion’’? 
And then we are going to have to 
walk through the reality of the misery 
you have brought to my State, my 
community. 
Last Thursday, we did a roundtable 
with the true experts in our commu-
nity in regard to fentanyl and drug use. 
I was sitting next to a mother who lost 
her teenage son by taking a single pill. 
You have us come here and talk 
about the fentanyl crisis. Do you un-
derstand the scale? 
Phoenix has functionally become the 
distribution hub of North America. One 
of the reasons—and I am going try to 
show it in the numbers here. When the 
border is just crowded with populations 
coming across it—and I stood there for 
a good 3 minutes, and there were 30- 
something people coming across the 
border. Over here were some other mi-
grants crossing over the dam. Over 
here is the Border Patrol agent saying, 
I am in the concierge business. I basi-
cally take people, I walk them over to 
the trucks, and we take them to proc-
essing, and when we do that, whole sec-
tions over here on the border are left 
unmanned. 
Then you wonder why a sergeant who 
is a Phoenix police officer, my neigh-
bor and friend, tells me a year ago it 
cost about $112 for some poor soul to 
get high for the day. Today it is $12. 
If you believe in basic economics, 
when the price crashes by 112 to 12, do 
you understand the depravity, the cru-
elty that Democrats’ definition of 
‘‘compassion’’ has brought to our own 
communities? 
I will try to do this—and I have done 
a version of this before—you have got 
to think of the effects of the policy 
that the left is engaged in. When you 
open up the borders, you get more 
drugs. If you get more drugs, you are 
getting more homeless. If you are get-
ting more homeless, you have in-
creased crime. And then you have 
deaths. 
How many people in the last day or 
so have come behind these microphones 
and said, Well, according to the latest 
statistics, we have 112 Americans who 
died of fentanyl that we know of. Well, 
our problem in the Phoenix area is not 
only fentanyl, it is meth, and it is 
other things. 
How do I get the left to be willing to 
understand, if you love and care about 
people, your version of compassion is 
cruel? 
So let’s actually walk through some 
of the obvious, and then try to add a 
little bit of color and see if we can 
make this sort of come together as an 
understanding. 
First, let’s just do the basic math. 
We are being told, Hey, we are heading 
in this fiscal year already to almost a 
million people. 
I had the experience last Wednesday 
of standing there. I have some distant 
relatives who do some farming down in 
the Yuma area, so I am an Arizonan, 
and I am at the border dozens of times. 
I went and visited the Border Patrol 
station, and I know some of the folks 
there, and I saw the faces of individuals 
who feel like they have just been 
crushed. They are law enforcement, 
and they are not able to protect the

border because they are functionally in 
the people management business. They 
are taking people here and moving 
them over here so they can be proc-
essed, so they can be let go, so they can 
get a return order 6 years from now. 
This is what is going on. 
Then they turn to you and say, I am 
here to stop drugs and weapons and po-
tentially horrible people, terrorists, 
coming across our border, and I am 
now functionally in the human trans-
portation business. That is what we 
have turned our Border Patrol into. 
Then you meet with some of the Cus-
toms and Border Protection officials, 
and they say, Yes, you know, fentanyl 
may be coming right through the bor-
ders, but they only have to go several 
hundred yards that way and there is no 
more Border Patrol because all of them 
are taking care of people; you can just 
walk across. 
Somewhere here I am going to try to 
do the other part of the discussion, 
where we talk about potentially if that 
is a million in the first half of the year, 
is it a couple million? Will the left 
have an honest discussion with us of 
why their version of compassion has a 
level of human exploitation that is 
really uncomfortable to talk about? 
The agent I was standing there with 
turns to me and says, You understand 
most of these people who are walking 
across right now are going to spend the 
next few years of their life paying off 
the cartels, those are the costs that 
they had to commit to to cross the bor-
der. 
If they can’t pay it off with a job that 
they are not allowed to have, do they 
have to pay it off with their body? 
Do they have to pay it off with smug-
gling, moving narcotics? 
Is anyone here willing to take a step 
back from sort of the radicalized ide-
ology and say this is not compassion, 
this is cruelty? 
We are functionally in the business of 
human exploitation right now, that is 
our border policy. Yet, when we see 
numbers of border encounters have in-
creased 278 percent, it is just another 
guy coming behind the microphone 
here and sounding like an accountant 
on steroids. 
These are people. And is it enough 
that several hundred of them will die 
at the border? 
Is it enough that many of them are 
going to have to engage in activities 
that are just absolutely exploitive to 
pay off the coyotes? 
Is it enough that the cartels are now 
said to be making billions of dollars on 
human smuggling? And they are using 
that money now to actually build their 
own little factories, so they can make 
the precursor chemicals for fentanyl 
and synthetic opioids because it is 
cheaper than getting them imported 
from China? 
We financed their Industrial Revolu-
tion. 
Think about this: The left says, Well, 
inflation, 
these 
things 
are 
supply 
chains. Well, dammit, they did a great 
job. We solved the cartel supply chain. 
We financed them enough so now they 
can make their own drugs from pre-
cursor chemicals all the way up to 
stamping the pill. You have got to 
think about those second-degree, third- 
degree effects of misery that really 
crappy policy brings. 
Why have there been so many on the 
right and now a handful of Demo-
crats—who are obviously concerned 
about their elections and realizing 
what they have embraced, but they are 
not willing to sign the discharge peti-
tion on title 42—why are so many of us 
talking about this: The Border Patrol— 
if you have an honest conversation 
with them—will turn to you and say, 
We are maxed out. And if you double 
the populations that are approaching 
the border because you functionally 
have removed title 42 so they don’t get 
sent back, they get processed, it is no 
longer being overwhelmed, it is just a 
catastrophe. There functionally will be 
no protection on our border, and once 
again, U.S. policy is functionally fi-
nancing the cartels. Congratulations. 
The misery, the murders, the exploi-
tation, which is U.S. policy. That is 
functionally what we have done here, 
but you did it in the name of, Well, this 
was compassionate. It is an amazing 
definition of ‘‘compassion.’’ 
Now, let’s actually get to some other 
bits of misery. This number is a fraud. 
The reason this fentanyl number is— 
saying we have had 133 percent in-
crease of capturing, collecting, stop-
ping fentanyl at the border—when you 
meet with law enforcement down on 
the border they say most people we 
can’t catch; we are too busy taking 
care of these million—now 2 million 
potentially—people crossing the bor-
der. 
What a great system. 
Let’s see. The cartels get to march 
people to the border. They may get a 
few thousand bucks a head, so they get 
financed there. And because Border Pa-
trol and Customs and Border Protec-
tion are overwhelmed, it creates these 
massive openings where you can just 
move lots of narcotics across the bor-
der. 
And here is what should be ripping 
your hearts apart: I got to sit next to 
a mom who told the story of her teen-
age son taking a single pill, a single 
pill that was stamped as something 
completely different, and 2 hours later 
that mom didn’t have a son anymore. 
In Arizona, 95 percent of our kids 
that died in the previous year—out of 
the 60 who died, 57 of them were from 
these fentanyl pills. Is there any love 
and compassion and caring for these 
moms that have lost their children? 
What is going on here? 
Is the ideology of this administration 
of the Democrats here in the House, 
are they so radically calcified that the 
definition of ‘‘compassion’’ is the death 
of 57 Arizonan children? Is that really 
where they are at? Because that is the 
outcome. 
I don’t know how else to humanize 
this story, but this is what we have 
done. Yet, now we see some of our 
brothers and sisters on the left, once 
again, saying, Well, we are actually 
concerned now, too. But you notice 
they won’t come sign the actual piece 
of legislation so we can vote on it to 
actually stop that increase. 
b 1700 
Forgive me, I can’t stop myself with 
the charts. 
Part of it, when you start seeing the 
explosion of increase—and it is Ari-
zona, it is my community that is the 
one that is crushed—when you start 
seeing Arizona having a 79.5 percent in-
crease in, functionally, fentanyl pills 
crossing our border, and that is what is 
captured. 
Remember, I mentioned before I did 
the ride-along with the Phoenix police 
sergeant? And in parts of the discus-
sion he was saying, Yeah, it is about 
$12 now for that heartbreaking, home-
less person there sleeping in that alley 
to get high for the day. 
That is what we have done. 
We have ZIP Codes now, I am being 
told, that the homelessness has dou-
bled in the last year. 
And what is the consistent policy 
thing that happened in the last year? 
The Democrats opened up the border. 
So let’s play economist for a mo-
ment. 
What are the couple of things you do 
to make the working poor and the 
poor, to make their life more miser-
able? 
Okay. Inflation. We have done a 
great job at that. 
Remember, one year ago, March, we 
functionally dropped another $1.9 tril-
lion on the economy. You look at the 
charts and, boom, there goes inflation. 
My community had functionally a 10.9 
percent inflation increase. I represent 
the community that had the highest 
growth of inflation year to year. 
Do you know how many people no 
longer can afford their apartment— 
functionally, can’t afford? 
You are crushing the working poor. 
But you can do more. You can open 
up the border. And this was actually 
left-wing economists that wrote these 
papers about 10 years ago. If you want 
to crush the working poor, import mil-
lions of people with similar skill sets. 
So one of the classic definitions of 
the profile of someone as working poor 
is they may not have finished high 
school, but they are selling their labor. 
They are out there hanging drywall, 
working their hearts out, they are try-
ing to find a way to get out. And now 
they are going to compete against who 
knows how many people who are going 
to work in the underground economy. 
You have added millions of people 
with similar skill sets. 
So how are they going to get the 
money to pay off their smugglers? 
Don’t you think they are going to be 
coming in the back door saying, I will 
work for cash; I will do this and that? 
Now you have other things that 
make the poor poorer: Crime, drugs,

someone stealing their stuff because 
they need money. And you look at all 
those numbers. The Democrats are in 
their, what? Now, 15 months of control. 
Every single number. Income inequal-
ity, the poor getting poorer, misery, 
death, retirees getting poorer, the mid-
dle class getting poorer. 
Great job, guys. Great job. 
Tell me something you have done 
that hasn’t increased misery in this 
country. 
I know this is uncomfortable, but I 
am doing it on purpose. Sometimes the 
smartest thing is to just stop what you 
are doing. Take a breath. Maybe the 
ideology is a false ideology. Back up. 
I am sorry the former President was 
into border security. But do you re-
member a decade and a half ago when 
it was the hallmark of Democrats that 
were concerned about illegal immigra-
tion? 
Do you remember it was Republicans 
and Chambers of Commerce that want-
ed to flood the country with cheap 
labor? 
Isn’t it amazing what happened here? 
It was only about 15 years ago that 
the left were the protectors of working 
men and women. 
We will not flood the country with 
cheap labor. 
We need our folks to be able to have 
a working wage. 
Oh, we are going to open the border 
now because it is compassionate, and 
we are going to screw up everyone’s 
life. 
What happened? 
When did the Democrats abandon the 
middle class, the working poor? Is it 
they weren’t voting for them enough? 
It is about the math. Now, we are 
moving beyond pounds, we are heading 
towards tonnage in the amounts of 
fentanyl coming through my State. 
Let’s put this in context. 
You see this little picture right here, 
those few crystals there? That func-
tionally is enough to kill you. So that 
is a penny. Those? That kills you. 
When does this become terrorism? 
Because it is already functionally kill-
ing our children. 
Does anyone care? 
Now, we have got to go just a little 
bit further down the rabbit hole. 
The border agents report over a thou-
sand percent increase, and these are 
the ones in Texas. The argument I was 
given by our friends at Customs and 
Border Patrol is they are not catching 
much of it. 
But it goes further. You have got to 
understand what has been happening in 
my community. This is just one of a 
dozen headlines when there is a bust 
and it is enough to functionally kill 
every single person in my State. 
There was a bust the night before we 
did our fentanyl roundtable. There was 
enough to kill everyone in my county, 
and I have the third or fourth most 
populous county in the Nation. 
Do you understand the scale? When 
you have the experts here saying, Well, 
David, you don’t understand. Prices 
have so crashed, a couple of years ago 
it would be several dollars a pill. Now 
it might be, at wholesale, 45 cents a 
pill. When it gets that cheap, you want 
to try to understand why it is in your 
elementary schools, your high schools, 
throughout your community, and the 
homeless campuses. 
That is the cascade effect. 
So I’m begging the majority to just 
take a breath for a moment, back away 
from the radicalized ideology and just 
take a breath and say, Do you actually 
love and care about people? 
Will you accept the misery, the 
death, just the dystopian devastation 
that is happening in our communities 
right now because of an open-border 
policy? That is what it is. 
And title 42 is not a solution. It is 
just trying to stop the catastrophe. 
Sign the discharge petition. Prove 
that your rhetoric actually fits reality. 
Or maybe the constituencies are now 
so gerrymandered and intellectually 
calcified that you can’t tell the truth. 
Another chart that absolutely proves 
we have turned, functionally, our legal 
apparatus to protect the Nation into, 
functionally, a transportation service, 
ICE. Immigration enforcement is, func-
tionally, beyond the border in our com-
munities. Those who got through, who 
were not stopped, it is up to law en-
forcement. 
How do you catch someone and func-
tionally remove them from the coun-
try? 
You see where we were in 2019. And 
then you see where we were in 2020. 
And do you see the crash over here? 
These deportations? 
Now, what is fascinating is this line 
way up here was actually even further 
up during the Obama administration. 
Did the left basically just crash this 
because the last President was so hated 
by the left for protecting working men 
and women that if he said it is Black, 
you had to say White? You had to walk 
away from it? 
We would be elated to get back to the 
actual law enforcement protection of 
the border numbers that were there 
during the Obama administration. 
There is this weird irony, and I just 
show this so folks understand the 
bizarreness of Democrat management 
leadership of this government right 
now. 
So illegal immigration goes up—well, 
it is not immigration, it is illegal cap-
tures at the border, presentations, 
those things—278 percent. 
But legal, if the person had just got 
their Ph.D. in electrical engineering at 
ASU and they can’t process the paper-
work, legal immigration has crashed. 
So at the same time we get the com-
plaints from businesses that they can’t 
hire anyone, that we need talent to 
grow the economy. 
As you saw the brilliance today, GDP 
actually fell pretty substantially in the 
last quarter. Yay, Democrats are doing 
a great job. 
One of the factors of economic 
growth is when you bring in smart peo-
ple. Well, that has crashed but we are 
imparting massive numbers of poverty 
into the country. That is the left’s 
version of compassion. 
I accept that some of this presen-
tation is a little bit on the aggressive, 
maybe slightly jerky side, but I don’t 
have another way to basically say, Is 
this really the Democrats’ vision of 
America? 
Is this really how you think we are 
going to make poor people less poor, 
the working poor more prosperous, the 
middle class much more prosperous? 
The thought experiment is very sim-
ple. Anyone out there, contact my of-
fice with something, give me a single 
thing in the last 15 months of absolute 
Democrat control of this Congress, this 
government, that the left has done 
that has turned out to actually be good 
for America, good for working people, 
good for poor people. You have made 
rich people a lot richer. Isn’t that 
amazing? 
Income inequality was shrinking dra-
matically in 2018, 2019, and the first 
quarter of 2020. 
Pandemic; Democrats take over— 
boom. All the things they told us that 
they cared about basically have gone 
to crap. And the math is the math. But 
as you all know, we work in a math- 
free zone. 
And maybe at some point we will tie 
our hearts, our compassion, to the ac-
tual facts. And when we do that, the 
really bad things that this Congress 
and this White House are doing to the 
American people will stop. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ator from South Dakota. 
ENERGY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, from 
the beginning, the Biden administra-
tion has displayed a hostility to fossil 
fuels. 
President Biden set the tone on day 1 
of his administration when he canceled 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, an environ-
mentally responsible pipeline project 
that was already underway and that 
was to be paired with $1.7 billion in pri-
vate investment in renewable energy to 
fully offset its operating emissions. He 
almost immediately froze new oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands and is only 
now making new onshore leases avail-
able for sale after being ordered to do 
so by a Federal judge. His first budget 
contained a series of tax hikes on con-
ventional energy production, and his 
budget this year, released in the midst 
of an energy crisis, calls for hiking 
taxes on fossil fuel companies to the 
tune of tens of billions of dollars. And 
the list goes on. 
Perhaps even more troubling, how-
ever, is the more insidious campaign 
the President has been conducting 
against conventional energy produc-
tion, using the long arm of financial 
regulation and government pressure to 
directly or indirectly discourage in-
vestment in fossil fuels and other in-
dustries disliked by his political base. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission recently issued a completely 
unworkable proposed rule requiring 
publicly traded companies to disclose 
information not only about their own 
greenhouse gas emissions but about 
those of their suppliers and even their 
customers—clearly 
attempting 
to 
make companies diminish or outright 
cut ties with traditional energy. Never 
mind whether this expanded environ-
mental, social, and corporate govern-
ance—or ESG, as it is called—desired 
by the far left can be accurately or 
consistently 
measured, 
much 
less 
proved to have a positive impact on the 
economy or for the climate. 
But the administration doesn’t stop 
there. The Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission established a so-called Cli-
mate Risk Unit that potentially seems 
designed to pressure industries into 
making certain investment choices. 
The Federal Reserve, which has zero 
business inserting itself into debates 
over climate policy, is suggesting that 
it should provide ‘‘supervisory guid-
ance’’ to large banks on so-called cli-
mate-related risks. Similarly, the Of-
fice of the Comptroller of the Currency 
recently issued draft principles for 
banks on ‘‘climate-related financial 
risk.’’ 
President 
Biden’s 
climate 
envoy, 
former Secretary of State John Kerry, 
has 
actively—actively—pressured 
banks not to invest in fossil fuels. And 
disturbingly, the original draft of the

tion’s Draft Strategic Plan for 2022 to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2200 
April 28, 2022 
2026, though it has since been revised, 
went beyond discouraging investment 
in conventional energy production and 
actually suggested that investing too 
heavily in agriculture—agriculture— 
could be problematic for climate-re-
lated reasons. Now, I am not sure 
where the National Credit Union Ad-
ministration thinks our food is going 
to come from if banks and credit 
unions don’t provide capital to their 
farms and ranch clients. 
All of these measures, as I said, are 
designed to directly or indirectly dis-
courage investment in conventional 
energy production and other industries 
that the far left believes interfere with 
its unrealistic environmental agenda. 
And that is a problem. While I am a 
longtime supporter of clean energy and 
come from a State that in 2020 derived 
83 percent of its energy generation 
from renewables, the fact of the matter 
is that our country is nowhere close to 
being able to eliminate our reliance on 
fossil fuels. Clean energy technology 
has simply not advanced to the point 
where we can replace all conventional 
energy production with renewables. 
And cutting off investment in clean, 
responsible oil and gas production will 
do nothing but drive up energy prices 
for American consumers and increase 
our reliance on energy from unstable 
or unfriendly countries, which, I might 
add, often extract energy in far less en-
vironmentally friendly ways than do 
U.S. producers. 
Americans are already struggling 
with high energy prices, thanks, in 
part, to the Biden administration’s 
hostility to domestic oil and gas pro-
duction, and I don’t think too many 
Americans are eager to see energy 
prices rise even further. In the worst- 
case scenario, limiting investment in 
U.S. conventional energy production 
could not only drive up prices but con-
tribute to fuel shortages here at home, 
as we may end up seeing with countries 
that are overly reliant on Russian en-
ergy. And I am pretty sure there aren’t 
many Americans who are eager to wait 
in line at gas stations for a rationed 
amount of gas. 
And it is not just high energy prices 
that Americans could have to worry 
about. If Democrats take their climate 
hysteria as far as discouraging lending 
to certain sectors of the agricultural 
economy, like livestock, which now 
seems possible, Americans could also 
see food prices rise sharply. I think it 
is safe to say that it is the last thing 
American families need in an economy 
that is already beset by 8.5 percent in-
flation, not to mention the fact that 
agriculture should actually be regarded 
as a good investment when it comes to 
climate change considerations. Amer-
ican agriculture should be leveraged as 
part of environmental and conserva-
tion policies, and our farmers have a 
vested interest in our land and water. 
Add in the biofuels industry, and our 
agriculture sector can responsibly pro-
vide food, fuel, and fiber for the Nation. 
In fact, the Department of Energy has 
found that ethanol derived by increas-
ingly higher crop yields has a more 
than 40 percent lower lifecycle carbon 
footprint than gasoline. 
Beyond all this, Mr. President, is the 
fact that the President’s attempt to 
dictate investment by privately owned 
banks and credit unions and companies 
is a misuse of the financial regulatory 
system. The President’s use of the fi-
nancial regulatory system to pressure 
companies on energy investment has 
all too familiar echoes of the Obama 
administration’s 
Operation 
Choke 
Point initiative, which used the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
the Department of Justice to target 
companies whose activities the Obama 
administration didn’t like. 
The question also becomes, Where 
does this end? The government is al-
ready pressuring companies on fire-
arms and energy investment, and now 
there are dangerous signs that agri-
culture could be targeted on perceived 
climate-related grounds. 
Well, what is next? Is the Biden ad-
ministration going to pressure banks 
not to lend to companies who don’t 
espouse the Biden administration’s ex-
treme abortion agenda or who donate 
to causes the Biden administration 
doesn’t support? Is it going to pressure 
banks not to lend to States with laws 
the administration doesn’t like? 
These are legitimate questions. As 
we have seen more than once, the 
Biden administration doesn’t have a 
lot of tolerance for those who disagree 
with its far-left policy goals. Concerns 
like these are one reason why I led 10 
of my fellow Republicans earlier this 
month in sending a letter to the Presi-
dent expressing our alarm with his ad-
ministration’s use of the financial reg-
ulatory system to attempt to choke off 
lending to conventional energy produc-
tion and potentially target American 
agriculture. And I will continue to 
work with my colleagues to ensure 
that the Biden administration and its 
regulators are not making improper 
use of executive power to discourage 
investment in essential production and 
to pick winners and losers among 
American industries. 
Americans should not have to suffer 
because Democrats’ climate agenda is 
out of control. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
runaway inflation is crushing working 
American 
families 
on 
Democrats’ 
watch. The share of Americans who say 
the economy is our most important 
problem hasn’t been this high since the 
last time Democrats controlled the 
White House. 
Just this morning, we got a dev-
astating quarterly GDP report. The 
economy actually shrank 1.4 percent 
over the last 3 months. No longer are 
Democrats just presiding over a dis-
appointing recovery. Now they have 
thrown the recovery into reverse, and 
we are actually going backward. We 
haven’t seen inflation this bad in more 
than 40 years—month after month of 
skyrocketing prices. 
It is exactly what everyone knew 
would happen if Democrats dumped $2 
trillion in printed money on an econ-
omy that was already ready for a 
comeback. 
But 
Democrats 
rammed 
through the far-left spending. So work-
ing Americans are paying dearly. 
This week, the same Washington 
Democrats who drove this inflation 
have finally figured out their response. 
They want to raise taxes on the Amer-
ican people. The Democratic leader 
said this Tuesday: 
If you want to get rid of inflation, the only 
way to do it is to undo a lot of the Trump 
tax cuts and raise rates. No Republican is 
ever going to do that. So the only way to get 
rid of inflation is through reconciliation. 
Said the Democratic leader. Now, re-
member, Senator SCHUMER is the same 
person who said in March 2021: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near term, are very real. 
Now the same person who predicted 
that inflation would not happen is say-
ing we have to fight inflation by dra-
matically raising taxes on the Amer-
ican people. 
The answer for Democrats hurting 
families once is for Democrats to hurt 
families twice. This is literally the 
Democratic economic agenda for your 
family: high prices and less money. 
Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts just about 
doubled the standard deduction for 
households. We created a brandnew 
zero percent tax bracket for the first 
$24,000 that a married couple brings in. 
Repealing that law would cut that in 
half and raise your taxes. That is what 
repealing the 2017 tax bill actually 
means. 
Republican tax cuts also double the 
child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, a 
tremendous help for working families. 
Repealing the 2017 tax law would slash 
those credits in half, but that is what 
Democrats say they want to do because 
of the inflation that they created. 
This is Senate Democrats’ position: 
Because their bad decisions have hurt 
Americans once, the solution is to hurt 
Americans twice. First, they hurt you 
with inflation, and now, they want to 
hurt you with tax hikes. 
We will see what our citizens have to 
say about that later this year. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, yesterday Secretary Mayorkas tes-
tified: ‘‘We will not lose operational 
control of the border.’’ But, of course, 
the truth is they already have. The 
Secretary’s own Customs and Border

S2201 
April 28, 2022 
Protection personnel are struggling to 
keep up with the massive, massive 
numbers. Only halfway through the fis-
cal year, they have already encoun-
tered a million people trying to enter 
our country illegally, and that doesn’t 
count all the people they actually 
never caught. 
But now President Biden wants to rip 
away the one remaining bandaid pre-
serving any semblance of law and 
order. He is canceling the pandemic au-
thorities that let CBP immediately 
turn people around and actually send 
them back home. 
This week, the administration put 
out a laughable excuse for a new border 
security plan. In this new memo, Sec-
retary Mayorkas says he aims to have 
a total capacity to hold 18,000 illegal 
immigrants in custody at one time. 
But here is the problem: That is the 
number of illegal immigrants that 
some CBP officials fear we could soon 
be seeing every single day. Let me say 
that again. The administration hopes 
they will soon be able to hold 18,000 
people total in custody, while the ex-
perts warn we could soon have 18,000 
coming in every single day. 
So perhaps that is why the second 
main point in this Mayorkas memo is 
this: ‘‘moving with deliberate speed to 
mitigate potential overcrowding at 
Border Patrol stations.’’ So if you 
translate that from Washington speak 
into plain English, it means they want 
to speed up catch-and-release a whole 
lot faster. They don’t have a plan to se-
cure the border. They have a plan to 
keep the turnstiles greased up and 
spinning as fast as possible—a total ab-
dication and the opposite of what the 
American people expect. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
Mr. President, now, on one final mat-
ter, the free world has rallied behind 
Ukraine, including by supplying lethal 
aid that Ukrainians need to actually 
fight and win this war. But it is not 
enough for Americans and our allies to 
help arm Ukraine; we need to mod-
ernize and grow our own defenses at 
the same time. After just 2 months, our 
aid to Ukraine has drawn down a quar-
ter—a quarter—of our entire stockpile 
of Stinger anti-air missiles and a third 
of our Javelin antitank missiles. Our 
eastern flank allies’ stockpiles of simi-
lar weapons have also shrunk as well. 
So this is a wake-up call and not just 
about our ability to support the cur-
rent fight; Ukraine’s expenditure rate 
of critical munitions should cause us to 
question whether our own wartime re-
quirements for weapons systems and 
munitions are sufficient. 
This would be less of a problem if we 
had a robust defense industrial base to 
quickly refill our armories. But defense 
manufacturers have admitted that the 
production lines for some critical com-
ponents have actually dried up, and it 
could be years before they could re-
place the weapons that we have already 
sent to Ukraine. 
We live in a dangerous world. Wheth-
er it is the prospect of escalation by 
Russia against NATO today or the 
threat of aggression by China, Iran, 
North Korea, or some other adversary 
tomorrow, America must be prepared 
to project power all over the globe. 
We cannot assume our adversaries 
will give us time to prepare for battle 
or to restock in the middle of one. For 
the sake of deterring the next conflict 
or winning it if deterrence fails, we 
must invest in our military readiness. 
For 2 years in a row, the administra-
tion has submitted budgets that do not 
adequately resource our military. They 
have failed to even keep pace with 
President Biden’s inflation, meaning a 
net cut in funding. And with prices 
soaring, it won’t just take longer to 
build new Stingers and Javelins; it will 
cost more for them as well. 
Congress has already given the ad-
ministration significant tools and au-
thorities to help America’s defense in-
dustry address the urgent and growing 
demand for critical munitions and 
weapons systems. This is precisely— 
precisely—the situation the Defense 
Production Act was designed to ad-
dress. But instead of invoking the DPA 
as intended, this administration has 
entertained far-left schemes to use it 
for unrelated liberal goals like environ-
mental policy. 
But I am glad to hear President 
Biden will be traveling to Alabama 
next week to visit a facility that man-
ufactures Javelins. While he is there, I 
hope he will reconsider what his ad-
ministration is doing to ramp up pro-
duction of other critical munitions and 
weapons systems. 
I hope he will recognize what is need-
ed to enhance America’s security and 
that of our NATO eastern flank allies 
and 
Asian 
partners 
threatened 
by 
China. The President should use the 
powerful tools he already has—he al-
ready has—to fix this shortfall before 
it is too late. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been a good week in the Senate because 
two important things happened. First, 
we finally confirmed every single U.S. 
attorney that had been blocked by Re-
publicans, making the country safer. 
And today, the Senate is taking the 
next big step toward enacting major 
legislation to create jobs, bring back 
American manufacturing, strengthen 
supply chains, and unleash another 
generation of American innovation. 
Later today, we will vote to enter 
into a conference committee with the 
House on the competition and innova-
tion legislation, and we will work with 
the House to finalize this jobs competi-
tiveness bill. We will also vote next 
Tuesday and Wednesday on 28 motions 
to instruct—8 from Democrats, 20 from 
Republicans. 
There is still a lot of work to do be-
fore we send this competitive jobs bill 
to the President’s desk. Not everyone 
is going to get what they want, but 
even so, this bill is going to be just 
what the doctor ordered to boost our 
economy, bring back manufacturing 
jobs, and lower costs for American fam-
ilies. 
Let me say it again. Today, the Sen-
ate is moving forward on legislation 
that is awash with good news for Amer-
ican jobs, American families, American 
innovation. It is great news for Amer-
ican families who want to see lower 
costs on daily essentials. It is great 
news for workers who want to see good- 
paying manufacturing jobs brought 
back from overseas. It is great news for 
our businesses, especially our chip 
manufacturers that need help strength-
ening supply chains. And it is great 
news for our innovators, scientists, 
workers at universities, and creators 
who will help us create new tech-
nologies and generate the next wave of 
good-paying jobs in this century. 
Now, we Democrats have bent over 
backward to get this bill done. We al-
lowed a very long list of motions to in-
struct. In fact, it is the most votes on 
motions to instruct of any bill in dec-
ades. And it is a sign of both the im-
mense good will we have shown to our 
Republican colleagues and the fact 
that many Members on both sides of 
the aisle have a stake in seeing the bill 
finalized. 
Frankly, it shouldn’t have taken us 
so long to get to this point of forming 
a conference on the USICA legislation, 
but, once again, it is good news that 
the bill is moving forward. 
I thank my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle who worked in good 
faith to help us reach this point. I give 
a particular shout-out to Chairman 
CANTWELL, as well as Senator YOUNG, 
my cosponsor on this legislation. 
CONFIRMATIONS AND NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, as I also mentioned, 
we got more good news yesterday after 
the Senate confirmed every single U.S. 
attorney who had been blocked by a 
handful of Republican obstructionists. 
It was about time that Republicans 
finally relented on their dangerous and 
indefensible blockade on Federal pros-
ecutors. I don’t think it has ever hap-
pened before. These U.S. attorneys are 
vital to keeping Americans safe. They 
are not political positions; they are en-
tirely dedicated to preserving public 
safety and protecting our communities. 
It was totally reckless for a very 
small band of Republicans, who claim 
to care about public safety, to have 
halted these Federal prosecutors for so 
long just to score political points. 
Still, after months of unnecessary 
delay, 
Americans

Georgia 
and 
Michigan and Ohio and Nevada and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2202 
April 28, 2022 
Minnesota and New Hampshire and 
other States can breathe a sigh of re-
lief that the Republican blockade on 
Federal prosecutors has broken. 
Now, there are many other very im-
portant and uncontroversial nominees 
who are still being blocked by a hand-
ful of Senate Republicans. Many of 
them deal with national security. 
Many of them would help our country 
find ways to lower costs. Republicans 
should 
drop 
their 
holds 
on 
these 
uncontroversial nominees at once or 
else we are going to have to keep Mem-
bers here in the Chamber for late night 
and weekend sessions to get them 
through. 
Finally, I want to say it was egre-
gious for Republicans to similarly pre-
vent the nomination of Lisa Cook to go 
through this week. Make no mistake, 
we are going to get her confirmed 
through the Senate as soon as we can. 
Lisa Cook is a historic and highly 
qualified nominee. She will be the first 
Black woman ever to sit on the Federal 
Reserve Board of Governors. Her fam-
ily, literally, fought segregation grow-
ing up in rural Georgia. And despite 
personally facing immense discrimina-
tion, she is now professor of economics 
at Michigan State, a former adviser to 
President Obama’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, and is on the Chicago 
Fed Board’s academic advisory board. 
A historic Federal Reserve nominee 
who accomplished as much as Lisa 
Cook deserves far, far better treatment 
than what Republicans have shown. 
But, nevertheless, the Senate will vote 
on her confirmation as soon as we can. 
FEDERAL FUNDING 
Mr. 
President, 
on 
Ukraine 
and 
COVID, this morning, President Biden 
has sent Congress his request for $33 
billion in emergency funding to sup-
port the Ukrainian people. This is a big 
but critically necessary package. I will 
make sure the Senate prioritizes this 
important funding package so we can 
get help to the Ukrainian people fast— 
ASAP. 
It was also good to see the President 
call for legislation to get tough on Rus-
sian oligarchs. This must be done. I 
will ask the Senate to arm the Federal 
Government with the tools necessary 
to put further pressure on Russian 
oligarchs and Putin’s cronies. I will ex-
pect we will include authorities that 
expand existing forfeiture laws to 
achieve that end. 
We need to go after these crooked 
oligarchs who have gotten rich off 
Putin’s regime. The war in Ukraine is 
on their hands, and the Federal Gov-
ernment should be fully empowered to 
make sure their moment of reckoning 
comes. 
Two months into the war, Putin’s 
hopes for a quick takeover of Ukraine 
have all but extinguished, thanks to 
the bravery of the Ukrainian people 
and in addition to the aid that the 
United States has provided in the 
forms of Javelins, Stingers, armed car-
riers, tanks, and so many other critical 
weapons. 
This is a fight against democracy— 
this is a fight of democracy against 
authoritarianism. 
So every penny we approve for 
Ukraine is money well spent. And the 
fight is far from over. We can’t stop 
now. We must make sure that the 
Ukrainian people will continue to have 
the help they need for as long as they 
need it. 
The Senate must also work in a bi-
partisan way to pass another round of 
time-sensitive COVID funding. On both 
Ukraine funding and COVID funding, 
Republican obstruction will not serve 
the American people. 
The administration has made clear it 
needs more COVID money right now in 
order to secure the next round of vac-
cine doses, testing, and the new life-
saving therapeutics, which are so good 
that if you get a positive test and you 
take the therapeutic, the likelihood of 
getting any kind of COVID, particu-
larly the more severe kind, is vir-
tually—is minimal. These are amazing 
drugs. But what is happening? Since we 
don’t have the money to purchase 
them, other countries are going to the 
companies—American 
companies, 
American innovation that has made 
them. And God forbid there is another 
variant. We may not have them—all 
because of delay and political games on 
the other side stopping the COVID leg-
islation. 
The administration has made clear 
they need this money right now, and, 
as I said, if we wait, other nations are 
going to beat us to the punch, and 
America might be left waiting for 
months before more supplies are made. 
This is a risk. It may be a few months 
away but very real. It is a risk that the 
American people simply can’t afford. 
Of course, there is a very simple way 
we can prevent another closure of 
schools and churches and businesses. 
Republicans should work with Demo-
crats to pass another COVID funding 
bill ASAP. No political games. No poi-
son pills. No dithering about. 
In short, we must get both Ukrainian 
emergency relief and COVID funding 
relief done quickly. 
OIL COMPANIES 
Mr. President, finally, on gas prices 
and the FTC, earlier this morning, I 
joined with Senator CANTWELL, Speak-
er PELOSI, and Chairman PALLONE to 
detail some of the ways Democrats are 
helping Americans ease the pain they 
are feeling at the pump. We are focused 
like a laser on developing and passing 
legislation to lower costs and improve 
Americans’ daily lives. 
Nowhere else are Americans feeling 
the hurt as viscerally and as repeatedly 
as they are when they fill up their tank 
at the gas station. We are thus working 
on legislation to fight bad actors who 
may be using COVID and Ukraine to 
jack up prices on consumers to pad 
their profits, and I intend to put that 
legislation on the floor. 
Oil is basically an oligopoly. A few 
small companies dominate it. And that 
means supply and demand doesn’t 
work. That means, for instance, that 
the biggest 25 energy giants in America 
reported a breathtaking $205 billion in 
profits in 2021. If there were real com-
petition, they would fight to get the 
price lower to get some market share, 
but with very little competition, they 
just keep the price up, and the con-
sumer is strangled. One executive even 
bragged to shareholders about the ben-
efits of ‘‘capturing value from high 
prices.’’ 
What are the oil companies doing 
with all this cash? They are helping 
their CEOs and their biggest, wealthi-
est 
shareholders. 
The 
amount 
of 
buybacks is skyrocketing. Buybacks do 
no good. They don’t help the worker. 
They don’t help the consumer. They 
don’t even produce more oil, for those 
who believe that is the way to go. They 
simply line the pockets of the CEOs 
and the biggest shareholders, and then 
they can go back and say: I got the 
stock price up—but not the way you 
are supposed to in capitalism by mak-
ing your company sell more, be more 
productive, but, rather, by this hor-
rible buyback, which has become en-
demic in corporate America and is very 
harmful to America. Yet we are seeing 
it in oil more than anywhere else right 
now. 
So it is high time—we need somebody 
to look under the hood, see what the 
problem is, and give them the tools to 
fix it. That somebody is the FTC. It is 
high time for the FTC to roll up their 
sleeves and drill down on what is going 
on at the big oil companies. 
Very soon, the Senate will confirm 
Alvaro Bedoya and return the FTC to 
full strength. But Congress needs to do 
more to beef up the FTC’s ability to 
crack down on potential gas price ma-
nipulation and price gouging, so we 
will work on legislation to that end, 
among other proposals to lower gas 
prices. 
Once again, as we reach the end of 
this week, let me say that I intend to 
put legislation that eases the pain of 
gas prices on the floor for a vote when 
it is ready. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from the State of Montana. 
RURAL AMERICA 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I could 
hardly hear you, but thank you very 
much for that recognition. 
I am about to talk about an issue 
that the man in the Chair, the good 
Senator from New Jersey, I know is 
passionate about. It is certainly some-
thing that I know Montanans are pas-
sionate about, and, quite frankly, it is 
what I do every day when I am not in 
this body, and that is, talk about rural 
America and talk about the issues that 
are facing working families and com-
munities across our State, across our 
country, those issues being inflation 
and rising costs and market consolida-
tion and depopulation and drought. 
Last year about this time, I made a 
quick trip to the town of Great Falls, 
which is about 75 miles away from my

April 28, 2022 
farm, to pick up some tires, and I was 
shocked about not only the price but 
the availability. Prices had gone up, 
and availability was—well, they were 
high in demand, and there wasn’t a lot 
of inventory. 
When I got back home, almost the 
same moment in time, I got a call from 
my equipment dealer—and this was the 
first time this has ever happened to me 
in my 44 years on the farm—and the 
equipment dealer said: We are going to 
have harvest in about 60 to 90 days, and 
if you have any repairs that you need 
to be done on your combine, we need to 
know what those are today so we can 
get the parts ordered. Otherwise, we 
can’t guarantee you those parts will be 
here. 
That was the second shock about the 
supply chain issues that I was dealt 
with. 
So when I came back here to DC, I 
rang the alarm about the rising costs 
that were occurring in rural America 
and 
impacting 
producers 
in 
rural 
America caused by this pandemic. I 
had a manufacturer in my office a few 
weeks ago saying how this pandemic 
has made it so they can’t supply Amer-
ica with what they were making. He 
said: You know, during the pandemic, 
we told folks to go home, and the 40- 
and 50-year-olds have forgotten to 
come back. 
So, quite frankly, this pandemic has 
created some challenges in business, in 
manufacturing, and in agriculture that 
we need to be paying attention to. 
Then we have Putin’s war in Ukraine, 
which has made things worse, particu-
larly in the areas of energy and, from a 
farm standpoint, fertilizer. It has also 
put a strain on our family farms across 
this country, which, by the way, have 
already spent years under the gun 
where things have not been that 
cheery. 
Even before the pandemic upended 
supply chains and the global economy, 
we had the previous administration’s 
unnecessary, 
needless, 
and, 
quite 
frankly, stupid trade wars, which dis-
rupted critical ag markets for the fam-
ily farmers across this Nation and the 
family farm ranchers across this Na-
tion who depend upon trade to make 
ends meet. In the years since, we have 
seen the price of grain rise because this 
administration has done a much better 
job on trade policy than the last one, 
but the fact is, we have also seen in-
creases in fertilizers, in chemicals, in 
housing, and in retail food. 
But the reality is that rural America 
truly is in crisis today, and it has been 
a growing problem for decades under 
both Democratic and Republican ad-
ministrations here in Washington. Ag 
producers have become so reliant on 
the Federal Government that in the 
year of 2020, the last year of the Trump 
administration, 39 percent of net farm 
income was provided through subsidies 
by the American taxpayer. That is a 
big problem, and it is not something 
that farmers and ranchers want either. 
The reason for this is because of mar-
ket consolidation, because of farm gate 
prices being artificially low, requiring 
this government’s support. To further 
contribute, whether it is buying inputs 
or selling our products—our grain, our 
cattle, our postcrops, or whatever it 
might be—consolidation in that mar-
ketplace, whether it is on inputs or in 
the market itself, has made profit-
ability at the farm gate a huge chal-
lenge, to the point where we have been 
driving folks out of business for dec-
ades and decades and decades, and it is 
getting worse. 
As most folks know here, I have a 
real life, and that real life is as a farm-
er. My wife Sharla and I took over our 
family operation in 1978. This oper-
ation is the same operation that my 
grandfather 
and 
my 
grandmother 
homesteaded in the early 1900s and 
that my folks took over from them and 
farmed through the forties, the fifties, 
the sixties, and a good portion of the 
seventies. 
In many ways, the little community 
in which I live is much the same as 
when my parents lived there. There is 
a big difference, though: The farms now 
are bigger, and they are fewer. 
This is an aerial shot of our place, 
and the arrows point to farms that, 
quite 
frankly—farmsteads 
where— 
when we came to the farm, there were 
families who lived there. There were 
people who sent their kids to the 
school who lived there. Now, those 
places—those farmsteads and those 
farms that go with those farmsteads 
are farmed by other people. 
In fact, in my home county of 
Chouteau County, which is a big coun-
ty—it is a big agricultural county— 
since 1987, we have lost nearly 35 per-
cent of our farms. The numbers have 
gone from 752 farms down to 477 farms. 
This is from 1987 to 2017, a 30-year pe-
riod, which is the last that we have 
data for. 
In the State of Montana overall, op-
erations over $2,500 have gone from 
20,000 basically to 17,000, as this chart 
shows—once again, the same 30-year 
period from 1987 to 2017. 
Across this Nation, operations with 
more than $2,500 in sales have dropped 
from nearly 1.6 million farms down to 
11⁄4 million farms in 2017, as this chart 
shows. 
So, look, if these charts show you 
nothing else, they should show you 
that, from a rural America standpoint 
and a food supply standpoint and a food 
security 
standpoint, 
we 
are 
not 
healthy. We are heading in the wrong 
direction. 
You know, there has been a lot of 
talk about agriculture and its impact 
on mental health. So try to imagine for 
a second that you are a farmer or a 
rancher. You are working nearly every 
day on the land that was your grand-
parents or your great-grandparents, po-
tentially 
your 
great-great-grand-
parents. The land is literally a history 
of your family and the generations be-
fore you who did basically the same 
work—feeding 
people—in 
the 
same 
place to make the same living, except 
that, over time, the numbers, they 
don’t work out anymore. The amount 
of money you have coming in when you 
sell your product isn’t that much dif-
ferent than it was years before, but yet 
input costs have gone up. 
By the way, I might add, they are not 
that much different than they were be-
fore because we have some serious con-
solidation in the marketplace, which I 
am going to talk about in a second, but 
yet inputs go up. Look, in the last 44 
years that I have been on the farm, I 
have seen many boom-and-bust cycles 
in agriculture, and I can tell you, every 
time the price of grain or cattle has 
gone up, the input costs have risen 
more than what you are getting in the 
marketplace, and then when those 
marketplace numbers drop, the input 
prices never go down. 
But getting back to that farmer that 
you imagine yourself to be like, I want 
you to think about what it would be 
like to take over the farm that your 
grandfather or great-grandfather or 
great-great-grandfather 
homesteaded 
and it has been successful for genera-
tions, and now, all of a sudden, the 
books don’t balance. You don’t have 
enough money to pay the bills. And it 
is not because you are a bad operator. 
It is not because you don’t know what 
you are doing. It really is through no 
fault of your own that you can’t make 
it work anymore. 
And we wonder why we have a chal-
lenge with mental health in rural 
America. 
So the question is, is why did we lose 
345,000 farms in the last 30 years, many 
of them generational farms? 
It is because folks can’t make the 
numbers work anymore. And that main 
culprit is consolidation in the cor-
porate ag world. No competition means 
you don’t get fair prices. 
So I have listed four companies up 
here that in the—or four industries, I 
should say—in the poultry business, 54 
percent of the poultry processing is 
controlled by one company. Sixty-six 
percent—or by four companies, I mean. 
Sixty-six percent of the hog processing 
is controlled by four companies. Four 
commodity traders control 70 percent 
of the global market for grain, and four 
companies control over 80 percent of 
the beef processing in the United 
States. 
Now, any one of these sectors—truth-
fully, any one of these sectors, those 
four companies could go out on a golf 
course and set the price that my neigh-
bors are getting for their products and 
that the consumer is going to pay for 
their products when it is on the retail 
end. 
And this happens while they continue 
to pull in record profits. And the ulti-
mate effect of all this consolidation on 
rural communities is it has pushed 
family farming and ranchers to the 
brink of extinction. 
And so you ask yourself: Why should 
I care? 
Well, for one, the American taxpayer 
is paying a pretty penny because of

this consolidation. In recent years, we 
have averaged well over $10 billion a 
year to help keep American farmers in 
the business across this country. I be-
lieve it is money well spent, but the 
truth is that there is not a farmer or a 
rancher out there that doesn’t want to 
get their check from the marketplace; 
they do not want it from the Federal 
Government. But without it, we would 
see even a bigger mass exodus out of 
rural America. They want their mar-
kets to work. They want to make it so 
it benefits them and it benefits the 
consumer, and, quite frankly, right 
now it is not working because we have 
four companies that control 54 percent 
of the food supply in chickens, four 
companies that control 66 percent of 
the supply in pork, 70 percent in the 
grain markets, four companies, and 
over 80 percent when it comes to beef. 
There is no competition, folks. There 
is no competition. And this is also bad 
not only for the taxpayer, but also for 
our food security. 
What this pandemic has taught us is 
when you have big processors with 
thousands of people that work in these 
plants and you get an incidence of 
COVID, for example, it shuts the entire 
plant down because you literally have 
people in these plants that are working 
shoulder-to-shoulder processing meat. 
So COVID goes through these plants 
like that. So they shut them down. 
Or you end up with a fire like we had 
at a processing plant in Kansas, which, 
obviously, a fire shuts the plant down. 
Or we have a cyber attack that hap-
pened on one of these big four, JBS, 
which shuts them down. 
So you say: What the heck? It is just 
one plant. 
Well, these plants individually make 
up a large portion of these percentages 
that I talked about. 
And so what happens? The market-
place goes away once again for the pro-
ducers, the farmers, the ranchers; and 
on the other end, it limits supply and 
the family—the working family that 
goes to the grocery store sees their 
prices go up and they say what do we 
want? Well, we can’t do this. I mean, 
we can’t afford to eat because the 
prices are jacked up. 
So it is bad for producers; it is bad 
for the consumers. 
And the fact is, is these packers are 
doing pretty darn well. The last quar-
ter of 2020, Tyson Foods increased their 
year-to-year profit over $469 million to 
$1.13 billion. That is a 140-percent in-
crease in profit. 
Now, I am going to tell you some-
thing. I don’t think there is anything 
wrong with making a profit. In fact, I 
think if you are going to have a busi-
ness that is successful, you have to 
make a profit. But the fact of the mat-
ter is, if we are making a profit—these 
kinds of profits—and it is killing our 
folks in family farm agriculture, I 
don’t think that is quite right. And I 
don’t think that is good for rural 
America, and I don’t think it is good 
for the consumers that live in this 
country. 
So bottom line is, we have got to put 
some guardrails on the system if we 
are going to make this marketplace 
work because it is not working today. 
So we have got some legislative solu-
tions. Congress has the opportunity to 
do something, and I have worked very 
closely with a number of my col-
leagues, including the man that is sit-
ting in the chair today, on bipartisan 
legislation that can put guardrails on 
consolidation and puts some sunlight 
on this industry. 
I particularly want to thank Sen-
ators GRASSLEY, FISCHER, WYDEN, and 
ROUNDS, as well as Senator BOOKER, for 
their good work. 
In the case of GRASSLEY, FISCHER, 
WYDEN, and ROUNDS, we have put forth 
the bipartisan Cattle Price Discovery 
and Transparency Act. That is a long 
name for a bill that is going to increase 
transparency in the marketplace and 
set 
regional 
mandatory 
minimum 
thresholds for negotiated cattle pur-
chases. This is going to ensure that the 
ranchers get a fair price, but it won’t 
ensure it alone. We have to do more. 
We have to also pass the Meat Pack-
ing Special Investigator Act, which 
will put teeth back in the Packers and 
Stockyards Act, which was passed back 
in 1921 because of consolidation in the 
packing industry, and we are more con-
solidated today than we were in 1921. 
So this will give the Department of 
Ag a team of investigators within the 
USDA, with subpoena power, dedicated 
to 
preventing 
and 
addressing 
anticompetition practices in the meat 
and poultry industry and enforcing our 
Nation’s antitrust laws that are cur-
rently on the books. 
And I am asking my colleagues, when 
these bills hit the floor—and I believe 
they will hit the floor, hopefully this 
work period—to pass these bills, get 
them to the House so we can get them 
to the President’s desk as quickly as 
possible. 
If you take these two bills, the meat 
packing special investigator bill and 
the bipartisan cattle price discovery 
bill—by the way, they are both bipar-
tisan—and you combine that with the 
dollars that the administration has put 
out to loan to small meat packers, to 
expand and start up meat packers, we 
will infuse more competition into this 
marketplace and that will be good for 
producers and it will be good for con-
sumers and we will not continue to see 
this decline in rural America. 
Look, a well-fed citizenry is essential 
if a democracy is going to survive. 
With the consolidation that we have 
seen over the last many decades, we see 
the potential for food to become a seri-
ous problem in this country, and poten-
tially even weaponized. 
Rural America is going to dry up if 
we don’t fix this problem. It is going to 
continue to see this diagram where we 
could see fewer folks on the land and 
we see bigger corporations manipu-
lating for their prices, because, quite 
frankly, they have already found out— 
‘‘they’’ being the big packers—that 
they can have it their way because 
they have had it their way for a long, 
long time. And because they have had 
it their way for a long, long time, con-
sumers are paying higher prices be-
cause there is no competition, without 
any regard to what people can afford. 
It is all about the profit margins, 
which—I will show you that one again 
too. 
It is all about record profits. It is not 
about making sure that we have food 
security. It is about how we can maxi-
mize our money at the expense of fami-
lies. 
And by the way, the same is true on 
the agriculture side of the equation. 
We will maximize our profits, and we 
don’t care if these generational ranch-
ers go broke. We don’t care. Somebody 
else will buy it. We will still get the 
cattle. It will be some big hedge fund in 
New York City. It is OK. 
So we need to do something because 
our citizenry needs to have access to 
food that they can afford. These two 
bills are going to help capitalism work 
for farmers and it is going to help cap-
italism work for consumers because, I 
am telling you, when capitalism works, 
everybody does better. 
I said this problem has been around 
for over 100 years since the Packers 
and Stockyards Act was passed in 1921. 
So there will be some in this body who 
say: Look, we don’t need to do this. 
This is government intervention. It is 
not necessary. Things will be just fine. 
I can guarantee you one thing for 
sure: If you look at where we have been 
and predict where we are going, if we 
do nothing, there will be very, very, 
very few people living in rural Amer-
ica. Family farm agriculture will be 
dead in this country. And if we lose 
family farm agriculture, this country 
will change for the worse in a major 
way for all the reasons I have already 
put out. 
So I am going to tell you what. Folks 
serve in this body because they want to 
do right by the next generation. They 
want to make sure our kids and our 
grandkids have the same opportunity 
that we had. They want to make sure 
this country remains the greatest 
country on Earth. I implore the Mem-
bers of this body: When these bills 
come to the floor, and they will come 
to the floor because I think they are 
going to come out of Agriculture prob-
ably in the next week to 10 days—no 
pressure, 
Chairman 
STABENOW, 
but 
that is what I hope happens—and we 
can get these bills to the floor, I hope 
that you put your shoes—put your feet 
in the shoes of those people that are in-
volved in agriculture, and I hope you 
put your feet in the shoes of the con-
sumer, because if we do these bills, we 
will be putting the country back on the 
right track for food security for the 
long term. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WAR-
REN). The Senator from Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2205 
April 28, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. If the Senator— 
first of all, I want to associate myself 
with the comments of the Senator from 
Montana, and I wanted to ask a ques-
tion because I—look, I hear from my 
cattlemen about this all the time. 
I think the issue is, they think they 
are going to get a price, they think 
they are going to grow beef, they think 
that they are going to have some cer-
tainty in this marketplace, only to 
find, at the last minute when the beef 
is about to be delivered to the packing 
house, the packing house comes up 
with a scheme or scenario to drop their 
price after our growers have made 
these investments. Is that right? 
Mr. TESTER. Yeah. So, look, you 
have a situation where you have got 
four companies who control 82 percent 
of the meat in this country. There is no 
secret. When you don’t have any com-
petition—and that is not competition— 
that you are not going to get a fair 
price. 
And, by the way, these ranchers all 
have fixed costs. It is not like they can 
just cut their costs. They have fixed 
costs. 
And 
right 
now, 
because 
of 
the 
drought west of the Mississippi, hay 
prices are at an alltime high. So all 
this stuff exacerbates the problem. 
What we need is more competition. 
We will get more competition. And 
when we get more competition, it will 
be fair for everybody, both the pro-
ducer and the consumer. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Well, I thank the 
Senator from Montana for articulating 
this issue. 
Too 
much 
market 
control, 
not 
enough transparency, and our growers 
basically get stuck with having in-
vested costs never to recuperate them 
because somebody used that market 
power to basically lower those costs. 
And, you know, we have seen this a lot. 
We have seen them import a ton of Ca-
nadian beef right at this very moment, 
right when they are about to deliver 
U.S. product into the meat packing 
plants: Oh, we just dropped the price 
because we got so much supply because 
they just let a lot of supply in from 
Canada. 
So this—the gentleman from Mon-
tana is talking something that is exist-
ing in other aspects of our economy 
too. So I am very glad that we are try-
ing to better police these markets and 
do a good job. And I know you and the 
Senator from Mississippi have focused 
on this issue, and we very much appre-
ciate you doing that. 
Well, Madam President, we are about 
to go to conference on the United 
States Innovation and Competition Act 
and the House America COMPETES 
Act. Boy, this is a long time coming. I 
want to thank Leader SCHUMER and my 
colleague Senator WICKER, also Sen-
ators YOUNG
and CORNYN
and other 
Members who worked hard to help us 
reach an agreement so that we can 
have this process today. 
Obviously, I hope my colleagues will 
vote yes to compound this motion and 
go to conference and allow for these 
various motions to instruct. 
It has been 324 days since the Senate 
passed this bill on June 8, 2021, and it 
has been 488 days since we authorized 
the CHIPS Program. I am here to im-
plore my colleagues to get this done 
today and to say that we need to move 
faster. 
We just heard yesterday from Com-
merce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who 
said even in Ukraine, weapon replace-
ment is being hindered by a lack of 
chips. We know that we are facing 
other problems. I am talking about 
Beijing with further lockdowns. What 
does that mean? It means fewer people 
producing products. It means more se-
rious supply chain issues. So if you are 
serious about America’s competition, 
Americans being allowed to build more 
and invest more in the United States, 
onshoring of our manufacturing supply 
chains, our competitiveness, then you 
want to vote yes and go to conference. 
We have had so many letters in the 
last month—the American Society of 
Engineering Education, tech compa-
nies that believe in the competition 
and the opportunity that we have 
seen—writing us and saying to please 
get this legislation done. We have seen 
used car prices shoot up 40 percent be-
cause semiconductor shortages have 
basically created havoc in the auto-
motive market. 
And it is clear that our European and 
Asian 
counterparts 
aren’t 
waiting. 
They are moving ahead trying to deal 
with this supply chain shortage be-
cause as the Secretary also told us yes-
terday, the shortage is well defined. We 
know that it is going to last well into 
the future; that is, there is demand. 
So the question for the world econ-
omy is, Are you going to try to meet 
that demand? And the answer is, there 
are a lot of people who are going to try 
to meet that demand. 
The question is, Are we going to try 
to meet that demand? The longer we 
wait, the longer we take to meet that 
demand, the more the investment is at-
tracted to go somewhere else. 
Now, the United States of America 
believes in having the leading edge in 
semiconductor production, and we are 
excited that the next generation of 
chips can do so many things for the 
smart appliances; smart tools; clean 
energy economy; obviously, the com-
munications economy; the next genera-
tion of all sorts of technology as it re-
lates to our telecom sector. But we 
need to get this bill done. We need to 
resolve the differences between the 
House and the Senate. And we need to 
have bipartisan support to show that 
the U.S. Senate can function legisla-
tively on an issue that is not a manda-
tory or annual bill but a process by 
which an issue, presented to us as a na-
tion—supply chain, competitiveness, 
manufacturing issues—that we can get 
the job done. 
We in the United States pride our-
selves on being a nation of inventors. 
We are a leader in global technology. 
We know that we can solve our prob-
lems by solutions that we, together— 
business and labor and government and 
R&D investment—can bring the best 
ideas to fruition and help us as a na-
tion. 
But we have to show that we, Demo-
crats and Republicans, House and Sen-
ate, can master the next step in the in-
novation process. That is what these 
underlying bills do. It basically allows 
us to dust off our R&D skills and say: 
Let’s do more translational science. 
So we have had lots of letters from 
people supporting tech hubs—invest-
ments of universities working with 
business in a centralized location to 
solve engineering problems and move 
ahead. We have the Manufacturing Ex-
tension 
Partnership 
Program. 
And 
many of our small and medium-sized 
businesses that need access to tech-
nology and supply chain data to better 
compete in a global economy and pro-
vide security want this legislation. 
So the risks of inaction are too great 
to ignore. The U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act is clearly part of our 
supply chain solutions. I urge my col-
leagues to not only help us by invoking 
cloture and going to conference but 
help us resolve these issues in a timely 
fashion so we can send a price signal 
about the investments that we want to 
make in the United States of America 
to make our Nation and our manufac-
turers more competitive. 
With that, I yield the floor.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Pursuant to rule XXII, the 
Chair lays before the Senate the pend-
ing cloture motion, which the clerk

CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the mo-
tion to insist on the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 4521, a bill to provide for a coordinated 
Federal research initiative to ensure contin-
ued United States leadership in engineering 
biology, agree to the request from the House 
for a conference, and authorize the Chair to 
appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate. 
Charles E. Schumer, Michael F. Bennet,

Patty Murray, Margaret Wood Hassan, 
Gary C. Peters, Mazie K. Hirono, Tina 
Smith, Alex Padilla, Debbie Stabenow, 
Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Mark R. Warner, 
Tim Kaine, Tammy Duckworth, Brian 
Schatz, Jon Tester. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-
imous consent, the mandatory quorum 
call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the motion to 
insist on the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 4521, a bill to provide for a coordi-
nated Federal research initiative to en-
sure continued United States leader-
ship in engineering biology, agree to 
the request from the House for a con-
ference, and authorize the Chair to ap-
point conferees on behalf of the Senate, 
shall be brought to a close?

come to the floor today to talk about 
the Biden border crisis. Right now, our 
Nation is facing a dangerous national 
security crisis at the border, and it is 
all because of the policies and the ac-
tions of President Joe Biden. 
Now, there are a lot of crises that we 
are facing. There is the border crisis; 
the crisis of high gas prices; there is a 
crisis of inflation, which is at a 40-year 
high; and there is the crisis of the issue 
of international affairs with Vladimir 
Putin on NATO’s doorstep having in-
vaded Ukraine. 
When you take a look at all of these, 
the two that I hear about most at home 
in Wyoming are that of inflation and 
that of illegal immigration. The thing 
that is really bringing this to the fore 
today and why I am coming to the 
floor to talk about Biden’s border crisis 
is the announcement that on May 23, 
distressingly, the crisis is going to get 
a lot worse. 
On May 23, the experts tell us, in-
cluding people from this own adminis-
tration, that the number of people ille-
gally coming to this country could 
double or even triple overnight. Since 
Joe Biden took office, there have been 
millions and millions of illegal cross-
ings from our southern border into the 
United States. The Border Patrol esti-
mates that more than 700,000 illegal 
immigrants got away from them since 
Joe Biden has taken office. This in-
cludes 62,000 people just last month. It 
works out to about 2,000 illegal immi-
grants 
vanishing 
into 
the 
United 
States every single day. These are the 
ones who got away. These aren’t the 
tens and tens of thousands who are 
coming through the process and being 
registered and released into the United 
States. Once they get in, most likely, 
they will never leave. 
Under Joe Biden, we are breaking 
record after record, and these are the 
wrong kind of records to break. Last 
year, the number of illegal immigrants 
who came to the United States was the 
highest ever recorded. At the same 
time, America’s immigration enforce-
ment is the least amount ever. And to 
that point, the Biden administration 
seems to think everything is going just 
fine. 
Yesterday, the Secretary of Home-
land Security testified before Congress. 
I was on a conference call with him the 
day before, where he met with a num-
ber of the Members of the Republican 
leadership. What the Secretary said 
yesterday is this. He said: 
We have effectively managed an unprece-
dented number of non-citizens seeking to 
enter the United States. 
‘‘Effectively managed?’’ 
To me, this is an early candidate for 
the fact checkers’ ‘‘lie of the year.’’ 
They haven’t effectively managed any-
thing. The only thing they have effec-
tively managed to do is erase the bor-
der completely. 
The men and women on our Border 
Patrol are working around the clock. 
They are heroes, although they have 
been vilified by the President of the 
United States. This crisis is happening 
because Joe Biden’s policies have tied 
the hands of the border agents. They 
are being both abused and disrespected 
by this President and this administra-
tion. 
On Joe Biden’s first day in office, he 
stopped all construction of the border 
wall. He ended the successful ‘‘Remain 
in Mexico’’ policy. In fact, just last 
week, his lawyers were pleading a case 
before the Supreme Court to eliminate 
a policy that protects the national se-
curity of our Nation. 
Joe Biden is now ending title 42. Peo-
ple at home say: What exactly is this 
title 42? Well, it is a section of our laws 
that deal with public health. At the 
start of the pandemic, the Centers for 
Disease Control closed our border to 
people 
from 
coronavirus-impacted 
areas. So this title 42 decision by the 
administration likely, at that point, 
saved thousands of American lives; it 
protected our public health; it helped 
our Border Patrol bring down illegal 
immigration. 
Last July, Joe Biden tried to end 
title 42. He said coronavirus was over; 
it was behind him. He was patting him-
self on the back for the great job he 
had done. And then the Delta variant 
hit the country like a sledgehammer. 
Joe Biden and the administration were 
caught by surprise. People looking for 
testing were running into long lines, 
empty shelves. He and the administra-
tion were caught completely off guard 
as has this administration on so many 
things—on the border; on the failure in 
Afghanistan; on inflation, which they 
said was going to be temporary and 
transitory, month after month after 
month. 
The administration showed they have 
no core competence to run this Nation. 
By September of last year, the Biden 
administration was forced to admit 
that one in every five illegal immi-
grants coming to this country was 
bringing disease with them. That is 
tens of thousands of illegal immigrants 
bringing disease into a country each 
month. 
But now Joe Biden wants to end title 
42 forever and do it on May 23. If it 
ends, we are told and believe that this 
will cause a tidal wave of illegal immi-
gration like this Nation has never seen 
before. Right now, Homeland Security 
is preparing for up to 18,000 illegal im-
migrants each and every day after title 
42 ends. That is half a million people a 
month. That is a population equal to 
the entire population of the State of 
Wyoming. Mr. President, I assume the 
State of Maine—I don’t know the exact 
population—but if you bring in half a 
million people a day, it doesn’t take 
too many days to add up to the popu-
lation of the State of Maine. 
So what are Democrats saying about 
this? Well, Barack Obama’s Secretary 
of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, 
whom we met with regularly when he 
was in that position—he once said 1,000 
a day would overwhelm the system. 
Joe Biden seems pretty happy with 
18,000 a day. Right now, we are at 6,000 
a day. 
We have a system that is over-
whelmed and it is going to get a lot, lot 
worse. Joe Biden could triple the num-
ber of illegal immigrants overnight to 
18,000 a day come May 23. 
Earlier this month, former Secretary 
Jeh Johnson, whom I alluded to ear-
lier—this is what he said. He said the 
current crisis trends are unsustainable. 
He said it overwhelms communities in 
Texas and Arizona; it overwhelms the 
Border Patrol. This is Barack Obama’s 
Secretary of Homeland Security saying 
that. I believe Secretary Jeh Johnson 
is right. 
Recently, the head of the Del Rio, 
TX, Border Patrol union—and my col-
league from Texas is on the floor here,

Del Rio, TX, Border Patrol union spoke 
here on Capitol Hill. He said there are 
some days in Del Rio when officers are 
so busy with transportation and proc-
essing of these illegal immigrants that 
no one is patrolling the border, the 
southern border of the United States. 
And I am certain that the senior Sen-
ator, the distinguished Senator from 
Texas—Senator CORNYN, who is on the 
floor—will address this issue after I get 
finished speaking because he sees this 
every weekend, as he is home in Texas 
and talks to people from Texas every 
day, the crisis that is hitting his home 
State and is hitting this entire Nation. 
So this Del Rio sector covers an area 
of 240 miles of border. And the head of 
Del Rio, TX, Border Patrol told us no 
one is patrolling that section of the 
border because the personnel are too 
busy filling out paperwork and moving 
illegal immigrants from location to lo-
cation. 
In Yuma, AZ, up to 90 percent of Bor-
der Patrol agents are busy with trans-
portation and caretaking duties. Nine-
ty percent of their agents cannot spend 
their time guarding the border. As a re-
sult, large portions of the southern 
border in Arizona are wide open, which 
is why I believe the junior Senator 
from Arizona is so vehemently oppos-
ing the President of his own party for 
a reckless move by a President, who 
seems to disregard the importance of 
even having a border to our Nation. 
Media reports show that 60,000 people 
right now are waiting at our southern 
border. They are counting down the 
days until title 42 is over. Some of 
them will bring in drugs, some will be 
human traffickers, some of them may 
even be on the Terror Watch List. If 
you are a foreign terrorist on the Ter-
ror Watch List, this is a dream come 
true if you are trying to get to Amer-
ica. 
On May 23, we will face a humani-
tarian crisis, a public health crisis, and 
a national security crisis all in one 
greater—much greater than the one we 
are facing today and is already terri-
fying Americans in every State because 
with an open border, every State is a 
border State, every city is a sanctuary 
city, and people are subjected to the 
drugs and the crime that is coming 
with it and the deaths that are coming 
as well. 
Now, many Democrats are asking 
and telling Joe Biden: Keep title 42 in 
place. Yet these same Democrats, they 
voted in lockstep with CHUCK SCHUMER 
and Joe Biden the last 15 months. They 
understand today that Joe Biden’s pol-
icy is unwise and very unpopular. But 
these are the same Democrats who 
came to the floor and voted to stop 
building the border wall; the same 
Democrats who in this very Chamber 
voted to give stimulus checks—send 
out checks to illegal immigrants when 
they voted last year. Not one of those 
Democrats joined us in supporting title 
42 last summer. 
Democrats can run for reelection, but 
they cannot run from their records. 
They voted for the Biden border agen-
da, and every Democrat shares the 
blame for this crisis. 
What happens if the border doesn’t 
stay at the border? No, it makes each 
one of us less safe. Border Patrol tells 
us they have caught, so far, 42 terror-
ists trying to cross the border since 
Joe Biden took office. How many got 
away? We are hearing the numbers get-
ting away is 60,000 a month—getaways. 
How many of those are terrorists who 
are now living in our midst? 
Federal narcotics agents say that the 
vast majority of illegal drugs in this 
country came here over our southern 
border. That is how they are getting in. 
Drug overdoses have never been higher 
than they are right now. One hundred 
thousand 
Americans 
died 
of 
drug 
overdoses last year. People are dying 
every day in every State because of 
drugs being brought in across the 
southern border by the lax border poli-
cies of Joe Biden and the Democrats. 
If title 42 ends, it is going to mean 
more drugs, more crime, more death in 
all of our States. Even the Washington 
Post newspaper—their editorial board, 
that is not known for being conserv-
ative or lining up with conservatives— 
this is what they recently said: 
A migrant surge is coming at the border— 
and Biden is not ready. 
All of America knows that. They 
know Biden is not ready. He is not 
ready to be President, not ready to run 
the economy, not ready to help with 
the military, not ready on any level, 
and at the border, the Washington Post 
points out he is not ready. 
The article went on and said: 
The predictable effect of lifting Title 42 is 
a new influx of migrants . . . which would 
compound an existing surge at the . . . bor-
der . . . for weeks or much longer. 
The Washington Post points out and 
predicts: 
Absent progress on [addressing the root 
causes], the Biden administration . . . will 
surely face more chaos at the border. 
This is an administration of chaos. 
The Washington Post—that was my ad-
dition. They ended by saying ‘‘more 
chaos at the border.’’ I am adding ‘‘an 
administration of chaos.’’ 
Look, the Post is exactly right. This 
crisis is 100 percent preventable. It is a 
crisis of Joe Biden’s choosing and Joe 
Biden’s making. It is a crisis that is en-
tirely the result of Democrats’ reckless 
open border policies. We need to go 
back to policies that work. 
I ask the President to keep title 42 in 
place. Listen to the Democrats who are 
talking to you in addition to us, Mr. 
President, who say keep title 42 in 
place. 
And enforce the laws on the books, 
close the loopholes that encourage ille-
gal immigration, finish the wall, bring 
back the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy; 
we know it works. 
The American people in every State 
are pleading with Joe Biden. Only 
about one in three Americans support 
the President’s policy at the border, 
two-thirds don’t. Overwhelming num-
bers oppose what this President is 
doing to this country in terms of how 
he is affecting the economy, inflation, 
energy prices, and the border. This is a 
President with record low numbers on 
all of those areas, and it is all of his 
own doing and his own making. Mr. 
President, do not make this, your own 
border crisis, even worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me 
start by expressing my gratitude to the 
Senator from Wyoming, Senator BAR-
RASSO, for laying out the nature of the 
border crisis that we are experiencing 
and have experienced at the highest 
levels in 20 years, during the year and 
a half—or year and a quarter, I guess, 
of the Biden administration. 
But I want to come to the floor and 
talk about an aspect of the border cri-
sis that has not been sufficiently dis-
cussed or noticed, and that is the con-
nection between the flood of illegal 
drugs coming across the border—not 
just with the 100,000 drug overdose 
deaths we experienced in America last 
year, but also with crime and gangs 
and guns in every community across 
the United States, from Maine to 
Texas, from Virginia to California. 
A Gallup poll published earlier this 
month found that 80 percent of Ameri-
cans are worried about crime and vio-
lence. It seems like there is a new 
headline every day about acts of vio-
lence in cities across our country. 
Two weeks ago, for example, a gun-
man set off smoke grenades and opened 
fire on a crowded New York City sub-
way car. Chicago just experienced its 
most violent weekend this year, with 8 
people murdered and 42 others shot. 
Earlier this month, a gang shootout 
in Sacramento killed 6 and wounded 12. 
The American people aren’t just notic-
ing this trend; they are demanding so-
lutions. Rising crime rates have caused 
many leaders to change their tune on 
this idea, this crazy idea called ‘‘defund 
the police.’’ 
New York City, Oakland, and Balti-
more are among the cities to reverse 
their previous cuts in police funding. 
And that is for a very simple reason. It 
is because defunding the police is dan-
gerous. 
There is no question that law en-
forcement plays an important role in 
stopping crime, but we have to remem-
ber that this crime surge is tied to far 
more than just police departments. I 
am reminded of a quote by H. L. Menc-
ken: 
For every complex problem, there’s a solu-
tion that is simple, neat, and wrong. 
So when looking at the factors that 
fuel this upsurge of violence and crime 
in our cities across the country, we 
can’t ignore a big contributor of that, 
which is the crisis occurring along our 
southern border. Some of the numbers 
are familiar to all of us. For example, 
Customs and Border Protection en-
countered more than 200,000 migrants 
along the southern border last month

alone, the highest number in more 
than two decades. 
The total number of migrant encoun-
ters over the last 12 months exceeds 2.2 
million. You might be tempted to ask 
what in the world is going on; why are 
things changing? I want to make one 
thing clear, though. I am in no way 
suggesting that all of these individuals 
coming across the border are dangerous 
criminals. Many of them are economic 
migrants looking for a better life. 
Something we all understand. 
But there are definitely people com-
ing across the border who are dan-
gerous criminals, primarily associated 
with the drug cartels, who threaten 
public safety in every city in America 
every day. 
We need to acknowledge that a 
human flood of people, even people po-
tentially associated with legitimate 
asylum claims, but that flood of hu-
manity, just the—having to deal with 
that many people, opened gateways for 
truly dangerous criminals and the 
drugs that are smuggled across the bor-
der undetected. 
I will give you an example of how 
that happens. Last fall, more than 
15,000 
migrants, 
primarily 
Haitians 
who had been living in South America, 
arrived at the small border town of Del 
Rio, TX, a town of a population of 
35,000 people. 
So all of a sudden, 15,000 migrants 
show up in a town of 35,000 people. It is 
not by accident. To state the obvious, 
the Del Rio Border Patrol Sector did 
not have the capacity to process and 
care for that many migrants at a given 
time. But that was part of the plan of 
the drug cartels and the criminal orga-
nizations associated with them. But in 
response, the administration moved 
Border Patrol agents from other check-
points to the Del Rio sector to try to 
help. But, of course, that is exactly 
what the cartels hoped for. 
Taking people off the frontlines in 
other sectors to handle the surge of mi-
grants in Del Rio opened up avenues 
for the drug cartels to smuggle their 
poison into the United States. 
Administration officials later told 
Congressional staff that this massive 
surge of migrants was, they acknowl-
edge, part of a coordinated effort by 
the cartels. They directed the Haitian 
migrants to show up at a single loca-
tion in a small town on the border to 
make sure that other paths into the 
United States would be cleared for 
their illicit contraband of drugs. 
Talk to any Border Patrol agent and 
they will tell you that this happens all 
the time. The cartels are very sophisti-
cated. They know how to game the sys-
tem. They watch, they wait, they co-
ordinate, and at the right moment, 
they bring their poison into our coun-
try. 
In many cases, they are moving 
drugs—everything from marijuana to 
methamphetamine to heroin. But in re-
cent years, Customs and Border Pro-
tection has seen an alarming increase 
in synthetic opioids, fentanyl coming 
across the border. 
As we all have learned, fentanyl is a 
uniquely dangerous drug because it is 
so potent, a lethal dose can fit on the 
tip of a sharpened pencil. 
In the first 3 months of this year, 
Customs and Border Protection seized 
nearly 1,200 kilograms. Now, a kilo-
gram is 2.2 pounds, so that is 2,640 
pounds of fentanyl were seized at the 
border, enough to wipe out the entire 
U.S. population. 
Cartels and criminal organizations 
aren’t just trying to smuggle their 
product into the United States, they 
have to have a way to distribute those 
drugs across our country. And that is 
where the criminal gangs come into 
the picture. 
Last Tuesday, agents from the Rio 
Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector ar-
rested an MS–13 member. MS–13 is one 
of the most violent gangs on the plan-
et. The following day, agents arrested 
an 18th Street gang member, and, over 
the weekend, agents arrested four addi-
tional gang members. This all hap-
pened in one Border Patrol sector in 
less than a week’s time. 
What we need to remember when we 
look at all this data is that these are 
just the ones we know about. We have 
absolutely no idea how many drugs and 
criminals have slipped through the 
cracks. Now, the Border Patrol has a 
name for this, they call it ‘‘the 
getaways,’’ but the truth is we don’t 
really know how many people have got-
ten away, undetected, to smuggle drugs 
or dangerous criminals into the United 
States. 
By one estimate, 385,000 getaways 
came across the border in 2021. And 
there is a reason they didn’t turn 
themselves in to the Border Patrol; 
they are not seeking asylum. They are 
not saying: I have been persecuted in 
my home country, and, thus, eligible 
for asylum potentially in the United 
States. 
These people, these getaways, are the 
ones that don’t want to be detected by 
law enforcement because they are up to 
no good. 
I think this chart shows the network 
of gangs and criminal organizations op-
erating within the United States. 
You know, most of the time we all 
think, well, the drugs come across the 
border, and we forget what happens 
next. But as you can see, cartels—this 
is a DEA, a Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration, chart—as you can see, the 
cartels in transnational criminal orga-
nizations have a presence in most 
major cities across the United States. 
Many of these are members of dan-
gerous 
gangs 
who 
want 
to 
make 
money, so they sell drugs in their local 
community, and they fight for terri-
tory, for market share. They commit 
other property crimes, other crimes of 
violence, carjacking, larceny, armed 
robbery, in order to fuel their need for 
money. 
So once cartel members and their 
gang associates get drugs across the 
border, where do they go? Well, they go 
to Chicago. They go to Detroit. They 
go to Atlanta. They go to New York. 
They go to San Diego. They go to vir-
tually every community in our country 
where they are then distributed to peo-
ple to feed addictions, which result in 
overdoses and death. It is not just a 
border problem. This affects every sin-
gle community in our country. 
Last year, the special agent of Chi-
cago’s DEA office spoke about what 
happens when these drugs and crimi-
nals reach your backyard. He said car-
tels use every means possible to get 
drugs from Mexico into the United 
States and then to local markets. In 
Chicago, that means predominantly to 
the gangs that control the drug mar-
kets in Chicago. 
But it is not just Chicago. It is lit-
erally every community in America. 
These are the same gangs that fuel the 
overdose epidemic, the same ones that 
perpetuate crime and gun violence. 
These are the same gangs that engage 
in deadly fights over control for terri-
tory and market share. And the cruel 
reality is, this is happening on a daily 
basis in every community in our coun-
try, which is contributing to the spike 
in violent crime and the public’s rea-
sonable concerns that they have ex-
pressed about it, including boneheaded 
ideas like defunding the police. 
A Drug Enforcement Agency report 
from 2017 acknowledged that drug traf-
ficking profits ‘‘increase the staying 
power of both street gangs and drug 
trafficking organizations.’’ The more 
money they make, the more drugs that 
are manufactured and brought into the 
country and spread throughout our 
communities. 
No community in America is safe. A 
rural, an urban, a suburban commu-
nity, none of them have been spared 
the pain and suffering of the drug over-
dose epidemic, drugs which predomi-
nantly come across our southern bor-
der by these criminal cartels. 
I mentioned it before, but it is worth 
noting that last year we hit a grim 
milestone in America. For the first 
time on record, more than a hundred 
thousand Americans lost their lives to 
drug overdoses in a 12-month period. 
Now, I remember what happened 
when Al Qaeda hit the United States 
and killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11. We 
declared war, and we committed our-
selves to rooting out these terrorists 
that exported this terrorist plot to hit 
our homeland. 
When 100,000 Americans die of drug 
overdoses, what do we do? Well, we 
throw up our hands. We say there is 
not much we can do about it. Supply 
meets demand. And there is some truth 
to that, but it is not the whole story. 
As I said, in recent years, the number 
of drug overdose deaths caused by syn-
thetic opioids, including fentanyl, has 
skyrocketed, and so have the seizures 
of fentanyl at the border, virtually all 
made from precursors from Asia, pri-
marily China, shipped to Mexico, man-
ufactured there in an industrial oper-
ation which can make a fentanyl tablet 
look a lot like some other medication

that you might take. Many people—too 
many people—have died thinking they 
were taking a drug for some condition, 
only to find out it was laced with 
fentanyl, resulting in their drug over-
dose death. 
The alarming increase in the supply 
coming across our border foreshadows 
even worse overdose statistics in the 
months to come. 
Fentanyl isn’t the only dangerous 
drug—methamphetamine, cocaine, her-
oin. According to the DEA—the Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration—threat 
assessment, 92 percent of the heroin 
that comes to the United States comes 
from one place: Mexico. Ninety-two 
percent. 
So when you zoom out and get a 
broader perspective and quit looking 
through a soda straw at what is hap-
pening at the border, you see it is not 
just an immigration issue. The drugs 
pouring across our border make this a 
public health crisis as well. 
The criminals sneaking across our 
border who are distributing these drugs 
in our communities all across the 
country are a public security crisis, a 
public safety crisis. The unlicensed 
guns that the gangs use to protect 
their territory makes this a gun vio-
lence crisis as well. 
Every single American should be out-
raged by what is happening at the bor-
der, but if you don’t care about 2.2 mil-
lion people showing up on our front 
doorstep, if you don’t care about the 
100,000 Americans who died of drug 
overdoses, do you care about the spikes 
in violence and crime in your neighbor-
hood, in your local community? All of 
these are inextricably intertwined. 
I don’t care if you are a liberal Demo-
crat or an Independent or a conserv-
ative Republican, this failure of the 
Federal Government to deal with our 
border crisis is absolutely appalling, 
and it hurts us all. 
I have heard someone say that every 
city is a border town these days, and 
this makes that point. This state of 
chaos is dangerous for the migrants 
who turn themselves over to human 
smugglers who care nothing about 
them, only the money they can gen-
erate from smuggling them into the 
United States. I have seen the bleached 
bones of migrants left behind, injured 
or sick, because the coyotes, the smug-
glers, care nothing about them but just 
the money they can garner from smug-
gling them into the country, not to 
mention the girls and women who are 
sexually assaulted on the long trip 
from their home country into the 
United States. 
It is unfair to the border commu-
nities I represent. We have 1,200 miles 
of common border, Mexico and Texas. 
My Governor, my State legislature, the 
people I represent are outraged that 
the Federal Government is not living 
up to its responsibilities. It is unfair to 
those communities, most of which are 
Hispanic majorities by large majori-
ties, who are sympathetic to the desire 
of people for a better life, fleeing no 
jobs or violence, but they are having to 
pay the price now, not just with the 
flood of people coming across the bor-
der, for which the Federal Government 
is completely unprepared, they also 
have to deal with the opioid abuse and 
the criminal organizations that are 
flooding 
our 
communities 
with 
fentanyl, heroin, and other dangerous 
substances. 
But it is not just the border. Cities 
all across this country are combating 
violent crime at numbers that we have 
not seen for decades. This is directly 
tied to the drug business at the border 
because the criminal gangs are the 
ones who distribute those drugs in our 
communities. 
The status quo is deeply unfair to the 
dedicated men and women of law en-
forcement, including the Border Pa-
trol, who put their lives on the line to 
secure our border and protect our com-
munities. 
Last week, Texas lost a 22-year-old 
soldier who was doing a job that the 
Federal Government should have done, 
but he was there at the southern border 
as part of a State National Guard ef-
fort called Operation Lone Star. 
Texas Army National Guardsman 
SPC Bishop Evans was attempting to 
rescue two migrants who appeared to 
be drowning as they were crossing the 
river from Mexico. He disappeared into 
the treacherous waters of the Rio 
Grande and, tragically, did not survive. 
Making matters even worse, initial re-
ports from law enforcement indicate 
that the two migrants whom Specialist 
Evans was trying to save are suspected 
of drug trafficking. 
There are a million and one reasons 
why President Biden should want to 
address this border crisis, and it is ab-
solutely inconceivable to me that his 
administration has done nothing to 
make this better, and I would argue 
that through some of the policies pro-
mulgated by Director Mayorkas, he has 
actually made it worse. He has made it 
more attractive for more people to 
come and attempt this dangerous jour-
ney from their home into the United 
States. He has made it easier, given the 
business model of the cartels, to get 
more of those drugs across the border 
and into our communities, contrib-
uting to the crimewave that is shock-
ing so many people. 
As we head into the summer months, 
which are traditionally the busiest 
times for border crossings, the Biden 
administration needs to do something. 
And let me just say, I am prepared—I 
know a lot of us are prepared on a bi-
partisan basis to do what we need to do 
to end this crisis. If the Biden adminis-
tration doesn’t want to lead in the ef-
fort, at least they could allow those of 
us here in the Congress to come up 
with ideas, like my bipartisan, bi-
cameral Border Solutions Act, to try 
to address this crisis that we cannot 
tolerate any longer. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
RECOGNIZING THE CORNERSTONE 
RESCUE MISSION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I 
recognize the Cornerstone Rescue Mis-
sion in Rapid City, SD. On April 29, 
2022, Cornerstone will mark its 40th an-
niversary of feeding and sheltering peo-
ple in crisis. 
Cornerstone Rescue Mission is open 
24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and it 
provides 
nearly 
200 
beds 
to 
men, 
women, and children. This organiza-
tion’s longevity is a testament to its 
hard work and dedication to serving 
others in need. Cornerstone serves an 
average of 440 free meals per day and 
has provided more than 180,000 people 
with a warm bed over the past 5 years 
alone. 
Not only do they provide food and 
shelter to those in their community 
who live in poverty, but they also em-
phasize the importance of helping peo-
ple improve their situation for the long 
term. The mission will assist people 
with obtaining legal identification, 
getting clothing for interviews, trans-
portation, spiritual guidance, and case 
management services to help find em-
ployment and housing. 
Cornerstone has changed the lives of 
countless South Dakotans, including 
American veterans who have served 
our Nation and sacrificed to preserve 
our freedoms, while showing them 
kindness and support when they needed 
it the most. The men and women who 
work and volunteer at the Cornerstone 
Rescue Mission are living a life of pur-
pose and are difference makers in their 
community. 
I commend the staff and leadership of 
Cornerstone Rescue Mission for 40 
years of service and wish them contin-
ued prosperity in the years to come.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish

ant to section 308(b) and in aid of sec-

April 28, 2022 
points of order lie against pending leg-
islation. 
The report shows the effect on spend-
ing and revenues of congressional ac-
tion through April 25, 2022, as com-
pared to the levels the Senate agreed 
to in the budget resolution for fiscal 
year 2022, S. Con. Res 14. I have revised 
the levels in the budget resolution five 
times for legislation, as authorized by 
the resolution. The report shows the ef-
fects of the 11 laws signed by the Presi-
dent since the passage of the budget 
resolution with significant effects on 
budget authority, outlays, or revenues. 
Tables 1 and 2 show that for fiscal 
year 2022, current law budget authority 
is $27 billion below the maximum al-
lowed in the revised budget resolution, 
outlays are $18 billion below the al-
lowed maximum, and revenues are $0.1 
billion above the allowed minimum. 
They also show there has been no net 
change for Social Security. 
The third table shows the Senate 
pay-as-you-go scorecard tallying en-
acted legislation with significant ef-
fects on mandatory spending and reve-
nues. The scorecard shows a savings of 
$7.8 billion in 2022, $74.8 billion over the 
2022–2026 period, and $139.9 billion over 
the 2022–2031 period. When compared to 
the allowable amounts on the PAYGO 
scorecard last adjusted on March 2, 
there is a deficit of $668 million on the 
scorecard for 2022, a deficit of $687 mil-
lion over the 2022–2026 period, and a 
surplus of $1.09 billion over the 2022– 
2031 period. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
letter and accompanying tables from 
CBO be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. CONGRESS,

For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2022 published in the Congressional Record on September 23, 2022, by the Chairman of the 
Senate Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 4006 of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2022 (S. Con. Res. 14) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, 
amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
In keeping with the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255), certain funding for the Department of Health and Human Services is excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act and the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. As a result, this estimate excludes $546 million in budget authority and $537 million in outlays. Similarly, in keeping with section 14003 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
(P.L. 116–136, as modified by section 101 of division AA of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116–260)), certain funding provided to the Army Corps of Engineers is excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Budget 
Act and the Deficit Control Act. As a result, this report excludes $2,099 million in budget authority and $2,083 million in outlays. 
a Current level excludes budgetary effects designated as an emergency pursuant to section 4001 of S. Con. Res. 14 (117th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2022. As a result, this report excludes the 
budgetary effects of laws, enacted this session, which were designated as emergency requirements in accordance with section 4001 of S. Con. Res. 14. Those amounts are as follows:

g Section 2201 requires the estimated budgetary effects stemming from division C to be excluded from the Senate’s PAYGO Scorecard; however, the insignificant revenue effects from immigration extensions included in division A are in-

ULYSSES S. GRANT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Ulys-
ses S. Grant, Civil War general and 
18th President of the United States, 
who was born in Point Pleasant, OH, 
200 years ago this week. 
In honor of the bicentennial of 
Grant’s birthday, which took place yes-
terday on April 27, 2022, I joined Sen-
ator BLUNT of Missouri to introduce a 
concurrent resolution in the Senate. 
This resolution honors Grant for his ef-
forts and leadership in defending the 
union of the United States of America, 
recognizes his military victories, and 
affirms him as one of the most influen-
tial military commanders in our Na-
tion’s history. I spoke about President 
Grant’s accomplishments briefly on the 
floor yesterday, but want to take this 
opportunity to elaborate on my re-
marks. 
Ulysses S. Grant was a proud Ohioan, 
born in Point Pleasant, OH, to Jesse 
Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant on 
April 27, 1822. I know a number of cele-
brations were held in Ohio to honor the 
200th anniversary. Grant’s family soon 
moved to Georgetown, OH, in Brown 
County. Grant spent the remainder of 
his youth in the house his parents built 
in Georgetown. Both his birthplace and 
boyhood home are preserved as historic 
sites that draw visitors to Ohio com-
munities today. In 1839, Grant left Ohio 
to attend the U.S. Military Academy at 
West Point, graduating in 1843. 
Grant was instrumental to the Union 
victory in the Civil War, leading Union 
forces to critical early victories in the

West at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Vicks-
burg, and Chattanooga. After President 
Lincoln appointed him Lieutenant- 
General of the Army in 1864, he com-
manded all Union armies until the con-
clusion of the war. At Appomattox, 
Grant prescribed terms of surrender in-
tended to set the stage for postwar rec-
onciliation. 
Grant’s legacy extends beyond his 
role in the Civil War. Grant was elected 
the 18th President of the United States 
in 1868 and was decisively elected to a 
second term in 1872, the only two-term 
President between Abraham Lincoln 
and Woodrow Wilson. As President, he 
oversaw the orderly readmittance of 
States following the Civil War, com-
pleting the restoration of the Union by 
1871. 
An ardent supporter of Reconstruc-
tion, President Grant championed the 
ratification of the 15th Amendment to 
prohibit 
discrimination 
in 
voting 
rights on the basis of ‘‘race, color, or 
previous condition of servitude.’’ In 
1870, he oversaw the creation of the De-
partment of Justice, essential to the 
prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan and 
enforcement of the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, 
the ‘‘Reconstruction Amendments.’’ 
Grant was an advocate for civil 
rights, endorsing and then signing the 
Civil Rights Act of 1875 to outlaw ra-
cial segregation in public accommoda-
tions, schools, transportation, and ju-
ries, nearly a century before such pro-
tections would be effectively enforced. 
And although President Theodore 
Roosevelt is most often associated with 
our National Parks, it was President 
Grant who designated Yellowstone as 
the first National Park in 1872. 
After his presidency, Grant traveled 
the world and wrote his memoirs. ‘‘The 
Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant’’ 
became a bestseller and garnered last-
ing critical acclaim, praised by Mark 
Twain for its ‘‘clarity of statement, di-
rectness, 
simplicity, 
unpretentious-
ness, manifest truthfulness, fairness 
and justice toward friend and foe alike, 
soldierly candor and frankness, and 
soldierly avoidance of flowery speech.’’ 
As I said yesterday on the Senate 
floor, history has not always been kind 
to Grant. But as we commemorate his 
200th birthday, his legacy is being re-
evaluated and his far-reaching impact 
more 
fully 
appreciated. 
Frederick 
Douglass eulogized Grant as ‘‘a man 
too broad for prejudice, too humane to 
despise the humblest, too great to be 
small at any point.’’ I urge my col-
leagues to join Senator BLUNT and I in 
honoring one of Ohio’s finest, Ulysses 
S. Grant, for these remarkable quali-
ties, for his role in preserving the 
Union of the United States as a general 
in the Civil War, and for his defense of 
Reconstruction and Civil Rights as 
President.

TRIBUTE TO CHRISTIAN BRAUN 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize 
Christian Braun of Burlington, KS. 
Christian was one of the outstanding 
University of Kansas—KU—players who 
helped lead the team to their National 
Championship game victory. He is a 
fan favorite who was nominated for 
Academic All-American and an Amer-
ican All-Big 12 First Team honoree in 
2020, 2021, and 2022. Braun’s former 
coach Ed Fritz said that what makes 
him stand out is his honesty. He is not 
afraid to be quick to praise or hold 
teammates accountable. I think this 
quality is what helped KU get to the 
National Championship and is a great 
reflection of Kansas values as a whole. 
His performance in the championship 
was nothing short of spectacular. He 
showed great leadership and dedication 
in getting the team to this win. 
I want to congratulate and thank Mr. 
BRAUN for all the hours he put into 
practicing and helping form this out-
standing team. It takes great dedica-
tion and determination to get where he 
is. The hours spent practicing and per-
fecting his game helped KU get to this 
National Championship. This victory 
will not be forgotten by Kansans—or at 
the very least in Overland Park where 
Christian has his own day now after 
winning this championship. Thank you 
for all you have done to represent the 
great State of Kansas. We all thor-
oughly 
enjoyed 
watching 
Christian 
play and can’t wait to see what he does 
next. It is my honor to congratulate 
him, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing this wonderful win 
and wish him nothing but the best in 
the future. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ZACH CLEMENCE 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Zach 
Clemence, one of the outstanding Uni-
versity of Kansas—KU—players who 
helped lead the team to their National 
Championship game victory. Zach, who 
plays forward for the team, was a high-
ly touted prospect for the Jayhawks 
coming out of Sunrise Christian Acad-
emy in Bel Aire, KS. This is Zach’s 
first year with the Jayhawks, and he 
ends the season as a National Cham-
pion. 
I want to congratulate and thank Mr. 
Clemence for all the hours he put into 
practicing and helping form this out-
standing team. It takes great dedica-
tion and determination to get to where 
he is. No doubt, his effort and energy 
during games or in practice played a 
major factor in the KU winning the Na-
tional Championship. This victory will 
not be forgotten by Kansans and will 
go down in history. We thank Zach for 
all he has done to represent the great 
State of Kansas. We all thoroughly en-
joyed watching KU play this season 
and certainly can’t wait to see what 
Zach accomplishes in the future. It is 
my honor to congratulate Zach, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing this wonderful victory and in 
wishing Zach nothing but the best in 
the future. 
TRIBUTE TO CHRIS TEAHAN 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Chris 
Teahan of Leawood, KS. 
Chris was one of the outstanding Uni-
versity of Kansas—KU—players who 
helped lead the team to KU’s fourth 
NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship. 
He is a fan favorite who committed to 
the Jayhawks as a guard as a walk-on 
for the team and has made an impact 
on the program ever since, even earn-
ing a spot on the All-Academic Big 12 
Second team last year. He currently 
holds a sports management degree and 
plans to pursue a graduate degree as he 
leaves KU basketball as a super-senior 
and a national champion. 
Chris attributes a lot of his success 
to his mom for pushing him to be the 
best. He said he looks back on the time 
they spent together in the gym as spe-
cial, even if it came in moments he 
didn’t want to be there. She knew he 
had it in him; he just needed to see it, 
too. I want to congratulate and thank 
Mr. Teahan for all the hours he put

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARY JO MORGAN 
‘‘MIMI’’ WEDGEWORTH 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
last week, my beautiful mother Mary 
Jo Morgan Wedgeworth passed out of 
this world and into the arms of our 
Lord. She left with all those who were 
blessed to know her a lifetime of won-
derful memories and a legacy of love, 
friendship, and service. 
My mother was a lifelong resident of 
Laurel, MS. During her youth, she was 
the 1944 winner of the National 4–H 
Club Girl Achievement award and the 
President’s Trophy. This was awarded 
to her at the National 4–H Club Con-
gress in Chicago. She continued to be 
an active participant in Mississippi 4–H 
Club programs, serving in numerous 
leadership roles and always serving as 
a local 4–H club leader. She served on 
the Mississippi 4–H Club board and as 
president of the Mississippi Extension 
Service Homemakers and FCE Club. 
She was a member of First Baptist 
Church and active in women’s pro-
grams and Sunday school. She espe-
cially loved providing beautiful flower 
arrangements made with cuttings from 
her garden for church events. 
She was active in the Mississippi 
Council of Garden Clubs, where she 
served as president, and the Deep 
South Garden Club Council as a nation-
ally accredited flower show judge and 
in the Waynesboro Drive Garden Club. 
She was known for her entertaining 
and educational programs on flower-ar-
ranging, gardening, and recycling. In

1987, she was honored by Keep America 
Beautiful with the lifetime achieve-
ment award for her exceptional efforts 
to keep our Nation beautiful. Some of 
her efforts included working to develop 
the Avenue of Magnolias at each of 
Mississippi’s interstate State-line en-
trances and also the garden club 
wildflower program. 
In 1976, she was honored with the 
Mississippi Volunteer Activist award 
for the thousands of hours she gave in 
volunteer service to her community. 
Indeed, her community activism began 
early with organizing victory gardens 
to support America’s efforts during 
World War II. 
She was active in the Jones County 
Republican Party, holding various of-
fices and serving as chairman of both 
the Jones County Republican Women 
and the Mississippi Federation of Re-
publican Women. 
She was a docent for the Lauren Rog-
ers Museum of Art, where she so en-
joyed giving tours and teaching chil-
dren about the collections at the mu-
seum. For decades, she served on the 
board of the Red Cross and always had 
helping hands to assist victims of hur-
ricanes and disasters who sought shel-
ter from the storm. During the after-
math of Hurricane Katrina, she and my 
father Hilman welcomed and served 
meals to hundreds who fled to the Red 
Cross shelter in Laurel. 
Throughout her long life, my mother 
strung together more than a few pearls 
of wisdom for the benefit of her 3 chil-
dren, 7 grandchildren, and 16 great- 
grandchildren, but the one that rests 
at the top of my mind is this: ‘‘Leave 
things in better shape than you found 
them.’’ Whether it was through the 
flowers in her garden or the gentle en-
couragement that banished my fear 
and doubt, my mother took her own 
words to heart every day of her life. I 
will miss her terribly, but I find com-
fort and inspiration when I remember 
that the world she left behind for me is 
a far more beautiful place today than 
it was when she made her grand en-
trance 97 years ago.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE DEVRIES 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Mike DeVries of Fergus County as 
Montanan of the Month for his dedica-
tion to serving his community and his 
courage during the Denton fire last De-
cember. 
Mike joined the volunteer fire de-
partment shortly after moving to Den-
ton with his family in 2004 and has 
been loyal to the department and com-
munity ever since, serving as chief for 
11 years. On December 1, 2021, Mike’s 
love of his community and resolute 
leadership was on full display. As the 
West Wind fire tore through the town 
of Denton, Mike acted swiftly to main-
tain incident command and ensure the 
safety of his firefighters and members 
of the Denton community. 
As Montana suffered a terrible fire 
season in 2021, Mike not only coordi-
nated aid and resources, he showed 
care and compassion to his fellow resi-
dents of Denton and the surrounding 
area. He met with folks who were im-
pacted by the fires and connected per-
sonally with all of the local firefighters 
and community members who showed 
up to help. 
Serving as the Denton fire chief is 
just one of the ways Mike gives back to 
his community. He is also on the elder 
board of the Denton Bible Church and 
has served several terms on the town 
council. As a volunteer fire chief, he 
has spent countless hours training, 
traveling, and managing the depart-
ment. His son Joel says that Mike is 
held in high regard by other fire-
fighters as he works to build relation-
ships between Denton and surrounding 
departments. 
While Mike is quick to give credit to 
his crew, he deserves recognition for 
his leadership during the 2021 fire sea-
son, loyalty to the Denton Fire Depart-
ment, and compassion for his commu-
nity. 
Keep up the great work, Mike. You 
make Montana proud.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4113. A bill to provide for the inde-
pendent investigation and prosecution 
of sexual harassment under the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Armed Services. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Sexual Harass-
ment Independent Investigations and 
Prosecution Act, also known as the 
SHIIP 
Act, 
which 
addresses 
long-
standing systemic problems in the way 
that the military investigates and 
prosecutes sexual harassment. I thank 
Senators 
BOOKER, 
GILLIBRAND, 
and 
FEINSTEIN for being original cosponsors 
and Representative SPEIER for intro-
ducing this important legislation in 
the U.S. House of Representatives. 
It has been 2 years since Army SPC 
Vanessa Guille´n was murdered after 
she reported being sexually harassed by 
another 
servicemember. 
Her 
tragic 
death was the catalyst to an investiga-
tion that led the Independent Review 
Commission 
to 
recommend 
key 
changes to the way the Department of 
Defense handles sexual assault and sex-
ual 
harassment. 
Some 
of 
these 
changes, including the codification of 
sexual harassment as a crime, were es-
tablished last year through the Fiscal 
Year 2022 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. Others, unfortunately, were 
left out. 
We must continue to build on the im-
portant work of the Independent Re-
view Commission and the steps taken 
in the Fiscal Year 2022 National De-
fense Authorization Act for the sake of 
our 
servicemembers. 
This 
includes 
codifying the requirement that any 
sexual harassment or assault com-
plaint to be reviewed by a third-party 
investigator outside the chain of com-
mand. This change is essential to re-
storing the trust between soldiers and 
their superiors. Servicemembers would 
no longer have to fear their voices 
being stifled or dismissed altogether. 
That is why I am introducing the 
SHIIP Act to require that all com-
plaints of sexual assault and harass-
ment 
be 
reviewed 
by 
a 
specially 
trained investigator outside the chain 
of command. The provisions in this leg-
islation will move prosecutorial deci-
sions on sexual harassment cases to 
the new special trial counsel, created 
by the Fiscal Year 2022 National De-
fense Authorization Act, and require 
that independent sexual harassment in-
vestigators be outside the chain of 
command and trained to investigate 
sexual harassment. These changes are 
essential to ensure servicemembers feel 
safe reporting any misconduct and that 
their complaints are investigated prop-
erly. 
I urge my colleagues to pass the 
SHIIP Act as another step forward to-
ward restoring faith in the military 
justice system. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 4120. A bill to maximize discovery, 
and accelerate development and avail-
ability, of promising childhood cancer 
treatments, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be joined by Senators CAP-
ITO, VAN HOLLEN, and MURKOWSKI in in-
troducing the Childhood Cancer Survi-
vorship, Treatment, Access, and Re-
search, STAR, Reauthorization Act of 
2022. This legislation is an extension of 
ongoing bipartisan efforts in the Sen-
ate over the past decade to get us clos-
er to the goal of hopefully one day cur-
ing cancers in children, adolescents, 
and 
young 
adults. 
Representatives 
MCCAUL, SPEIER, BUTTERFIELD, and 
KELLY are introducing companion leg-
islation in the House of Representa-
tives. 
I first started working on this issue 
after meeting the Haight family from 
Warwick, RI, in June of 2004. Nancy 
and Vincent lost their son, Ben, when 
he was just 9 years old to neuro-
blastoma, a very aggressive tumor in 
the brain. The heart-wrenching story 
of Ben Haight highlights the impor-
tance of this legislation. It is my hope 
that one day Ben’s story, and thou-
sands of other children like him, will 
be one of survival. With the strong sup-
port of families like the Haights, I in-
troduced bipartisan legislation that 
eventually was signed into law in 2008 
as the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer 
Childhood Cancer Act—the first effort 
to provide increased research and im-
proved treatment options for childhood 
cancers. 
Over the last several years, I have 
also had the pleasure of getting to 
know Grace Carey and her parents, Re-
bekah Ham and Russell Carey, of Prov-
idence, RI. Grace was diagnosed with 
brain cancer at 5 years old and stands 
as a proud survivor of childhood can-
cer. Grace and her family are powerful 
advocates in the fight against child-
hood cancer, having worked with the 
St. Baldrick’s Foundation to support 
the original Childhood Cancer STAR 
Act, which I introduced in 2015 with 
Senator CAPITO and was signed into 
law in 2018. 
The STAR Act took the next needed 
steps to advance pediatric cancer re-
search and child-focused cancer treat-
ments, while also improving childhood 
cancer surveillance and providing re-
sources for survivors and those im-
pacted by childhood cancer. 
If a treatment is working, doctors 
elsewhere should know immediately. 
The same should happen if a treatment 
isn’t working or if other major medical 
events occur during the course of a par-
ticular treatment. It is critical that 
doctors, nurses, and other providers are 
able to effectively communicate infor-
mation about the disease, the treat-
ment process, and what other health 
and development impacts children can 
expect to experience. As such, the 
STAR Act helped build a comprehen-
sive children’s cancer biorepository for 
researchers and improved surveillance 
of childhood cancer cases. Our reau-
thorization will build on these efforts 
and aims to make the biorepository 
easier for researchers to use, improving 
access to biospecimens. 
In addition, we must do more to en-
sure that children survive cancer and 
any late effects so they can live a long, 
healthy, and productive life. The STAR 
Act enhanced research on the late ef-
fects of childhood cancers, improved 
collaboration among providers so that 
doctors are better able to care for this 
population as they age, and began to 
explore improved models of care for 
childhood cancer survivors. Since im-
plementation of the STAR Act, the Na-
tional Cancer Institute has awarded 
over $16 million in new survivorship 
grants. It is critical that we reauthor-
ize the STAR Act to continue funding 
these vital projects. 
I look forward to working with Sen-
ators CAPITO, VAN HOLLEN, MURKOWSKI, 
as well as Representatives MCCAUL, 
SPEIER, 
BUTTERFIELD, 
and 
KELLY, 
along with advocates like the St. 
Baldrick’s Foundation, to build sup-
port for the Childhood Cancer STAR 
Reauthorization Act.

Whereas, each day, in total, an average of 
340 workers die from job-related injuries and 
illnesses in the United States; 
Whereas, annually, there are more than 
3,200,000 occupational injuries in the United 
States; 
Whereas tens of thousands of individuals in 
the United States with workplace-related in-
juries or illnesses have become permanently 
disabled; 
Whereas the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘OSHA’’), the primary Federal 
agency that establishes and enforces work-
place health and safety standards— 
(1) only has sufficient resources to inspect 
each establishment within the jurisdiction of 
OSHA once every 236 years; and 
(2) must receive the resources necessary to 
adequately protect the health and safety of 
workers in the United States; 
Whereas workers continue to face serious 
risks of injury, illness and death from 
COVID-19, infectious diseases, heat exposure, 
and workplace violence; 
Whereas millions of workers have been in-
fected with COVID-19, and thousands of 
workers in the United States alone have died 
from COVID-19; 
Whereas 
these 
injuries, 
illnesses, 
and 
deaths are preventable; and 
Whereas 
observing 
Workers’ 
Memorial 
Day— 
(1) allows the people of the United States 
to honor and remember victims of work-
place-related injuries and disease; and 
(2) reminds the people of the United States 
to strive for better safety and health protec-
tions for workers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Work-

workers who have been killed or injured in 
the workplace; 
(2) recognizes the importance of strength-
ening worker health and safety standards to 
secure the safe workplaces workers deserve; 
(3) encourages the Occupational Safety and

associations, and academic institutions to 
support activities increasing awareness of 
the importance of preventing illness, injury,

lights the importance of planting and caring 
for trees and vegetation; 
Whereas such activities provide an oppor-
tunity to convey to future generations the 
value of land and stewardship; 
Whereas working forests have contributed 
to an increase in the number of trees planted 
in the United States and are sustainably 
managed, with less than 2 percent of working 
forests nationally harvested each year; 
Whereas a key factor in preventing forest 
conversion and deforestation is keeping for-
ests productive; 
Whereas working forests are a critical part 
of a nature-based solution to climate change, 
and by providing a continuous cycle of grow-
ing, harvesting, and replanting, active forest 
management maximizes the ability to se-
quester and store carbon and improves forest 
resilience; 
Whereas private forests play an important 
role in conserving at-risk and declining spe-
cies, and collaborative conservation efforts 
can benefit species while also helping to 
keep forests as forests; 
Whereas sustainably grown wood can be 
used in a wide variety of resilient infrastruc-
ture and building applications—from tradi-
tional timber framing to high-tech mass 
timber—and as a natural, renewable, and 
biodegradable material, the significant use 
of wood building materials in buildings and 
bridges helps decrease global carbon emis-
sions; 
Whereas the Arbor Day Foundation and 
the Tree City USA program have been com-
mitted to greening cities and towns across 
the country since 1976, and, in that time, 
more than 3,600 communities have made the 
commitment to becoming Tree City USA 
communities; 
Whereas Tree City USA communities are 
home to more than 153,000,000 individuals in 
the United States who are dedicated to core 
standards of sound urban forestry manage-
ment and who dedicate resources and time to 
urban forestry initiatives, which helps make 
their communities and our country a better 
place to live; 
Whereas National Arbor Day is observed on 
the last Friday of April each year; and 
Whereas April 29, 2022, marks the 150th an-
niversary of Arbor Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes April 29, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Arbor Day’’; 
(2) celebrates the 150th anniversary of 
Arbor Day; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Arbor Day; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to participate in National Arbor Day 
activities.

Ms. HIRONO submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 602 
Whereas up to 2,400,000 individuals in the 
United States are chronically infected with 
hepatitis B, and up to two-thirds of individ-
uals with chronic hepatitis B are unaware of 
their infection status; 
Whereas hepatitis B is a viral infection of 
the liver transmitted via infected blood and 
other body fluids, including through mother- 
to-child transmission and injection drug use; 
Whereas hepatitis B is associated with sig-
nificant disparities among— 
(1) communities of color, including Asian 
Americans, Pacific Islanders, and African 
immigrants; 
(2) sexual and gender minority commu-
nities; and 
(3) individuals affected by the opioid crisis; 
Whereas individuals with chronic diseases, 
such as diabetes, HIV, hepatitis C, and 
chronic liver disease, and individuals on 
hemodialysis are at an increased risk for 
hepatitis B co-infection; 
Whereas there is no cure for hepatitis B, 
and individuals with chronic hepatitis B re-
quire lifelong medical care; 
Whereas chronic hepatitis B represents one 
of the most common causes of liver cancer; 
Whereas 1 in every 4 individuals with 
unmanaged chronic hepatitis B will develop 
liver cancer, cirrhosis, or liver failure, with 
liver cancer having a 5-year survival rate of 
only 18 percent in the United States; 
Whereas safe and highly effective vaccines 
to protect against hepatitis B are available; 
Whereas, in accordance with universal 
childhood 
hepatitis 
B 
vaccination 
rec-
ommendations in the United States, infants 
and children have been routinely vaccinated 
against hepatitis B since the 1990s; 
Whereas all adults between the ages of 19 
and 59 and adults 60 and older with hepatitis 
B risk factors are recommended to be vac-
cinated against hepatitis B; 
Whereas the hepatitis B vaccine, which is 
95 percent effective and was the first 
anticancer vaccine to be developed, is pro-
jected to have prevented 310,000,000 cases of 
hepatitis B worldwide between 1990 and 2020; 
Whereas only 30 percent of adults in the 
United States are vaccinated against hepa-
titis B; 
Whereas the number of reported acute hep-
atitis B cases increased by 11 percent in the 
United States between 2014 and 2018; 
Whereas, as a result of the opioid epidemic, 
there have been significant regional in-
creases in acute hepatitis B cases in the 
United States, including— 
(1) a 489 percent increase between 2015 and 
2016 in Maine; 
(2) a reported 114 percent increase between 
2009 and 2013 in Kentucky, West Virginia, and 
Tennessee; 
(3) a reported 78 percent increase in 2017 in 
southeastern Massachusetts; and 
(4) a reported 56 percent increase between 
2014 and 2016 in North Carolina; 
Whereas 36 percent of new hepatitis B 
cases are among individuals who inject 
drugs; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B is 
50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV and 
5 to 10 times more infectious than hepatitis 
C; and 
Whereas there are significant opportuni-
ties, particularly within the setting of the 
opioid epidemic, to prevent new hepatitis B 
infections and thereby reduce the incidence 
of liver cancer and cirrhosis through efforts 
to— 
(1) increase adult hepatitis B vaccination; 
and 
(2) maintain childhood hepatitis B vaccina-
tion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of April 30, 
2022 as ‘‘National Adult Hepatitis B Vaccina-
tion Awareness Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the importance of providing 
support and encouragement— 
(A) for all individuals to be tested for hepa-
titis B; 
(B) for individuals susceptible to infection 
to be vaccinated against hepatitis B; and 
(C) for individuals diagnosed with hepatitis 
B to be linked to appropriate care; and 
(3) in order to reduce the number of new 
hepatitis B infections and hepatitis B-re-
lated deaths, encourages a commitment to— 
(A) increasing adult hepatitis B vaccina-
tion rates;

Mr. HEINRICH, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Mr. LUJA´ N, Mrs. MURRAY, 
and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 603 
Whereas the Senate is committed to the 
awareness, prevention, and deterrence of sex-
ual violence affecting individuals in the 
United States; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’), 1 in 4 women 
and 1 in 10 men experience sexual or physical 
violence and stalking by an intimate part-
ner; 
Whereas, according to the 2020 Child Mal-
treatment Report of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, child protection 
service agencies throughout the United 
States substantiated, or found strong evi-
dence to indicate, that 57,963 children under 
18 years of age were victims of sexual abuse 
that year; 
Whereas, according to the 2015 National In-
timate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 
1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men who have experi-
enced a completed or attempted rape experi-
enced it for the first time between the ages 
of 11 and 17; 
Whereas sexual violence is a burden for 
many individuals who serve in the Armed 
Forces, and the Department of Defense esti-
mates that approximately 20,500 members of 
the Armed Forces, including approximately 
13,000 women and 7,500 men, experienced 
some form of contact or penetrative sexual 
assault during 2018; 
Whereas, due to the unprecedented chal-
lenges presented by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
including mandatory stay-at-home orders, 
the needs of sexual assault victims have be-
come even more complex and challenging; 
Whereas sexual assault does not discrimi-
nate on any basis and can affect any indi-
vidual in the United States; 
Whereas sexual violence may take many 
forms, including— 
(1) acquaintance, stranger, spousal, and 
gang rape; 
(2) incest; 
(3) child sexual abuse; 
(4) elder sexual abuse; 
(5) sexual abuse and exploitation of under-
served communities; 
(6) commercial sex trafficking; 
(7) sexual harassment; and 
(8) stalking; 
Whereas studies have suggested that sur-
vivors of color face unique challenges, and 
more should be done to better understand 
the impact of sexual violence on commu-
nities of color; 
Whereas studies have suggested that the 
rate at which American Indians and Alaska 
Natives experience sexual violence is signifi-
cantly higher than for other populations in 
the United States; 
Whereas, according to the National Alli-
ance to End Sexual Violence, in addition to 
the immediate physical and emotional costs, 
sexual assault has numerous adverse con-
sequences, which can include post-traumatic 
stress disorder, substance abuse, major de-
pression, homelessness, eating disorders, and 
suicide; 
Whereas, according to a 2019 CDC survey, 
the average cost of rape is $122,461 for each 
victim over the victim’s lifetime, totaling a 
$3,100,000,000,000 economic burden for sur-
vivors of rape in the United States; 
Whereas, according to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, an average of only 23 
percent of rapes or sexual assaults in the 
United States were reported to law enforce-
ment agencies between 2019 and 2020; 
Whereas many sexual assaults are not re-
ported to law enforcement agencies, and 
many States have restrictive criminal stat-
utes of limitations, which enable many per-
petrators to evade punishment for their 
crimes; 
Whereas advances in deoxyribonucleic acid 
(commonly known as ‘‘DNA’’) technology 
have enabled law enforcement agencies to 
identify and prosecute the perpetrators in 
tens of thousands of previously unsolved sex-
ual assault cases; 
Whereas incarceration of sexual assault 
perpetrators can prevent perpetrators from 
committing additional crimes; 
Whereas, according to a March 2021 survey 
by the National Alliance to End Sexual Vio-
lence, 45 percent of rape crisis centers lack a 
therapist on staff, and 76 percent of pro-
grams had an increased demand for services 
in the past year; 
Whereas national, State, territorial, and 
Tribal coalitions, community-based rape cri-
sis centers, culturally-specific sexual assault 
organizations, 
and 
other 
organizations 
across the United States are committed to— 
(1) eliminating sexual violence through 
prevention and education; and 
(2) increasing public awareness of sexual 
violence and the prevalence of sexual vio-
lence; 
Whereas thousands of volunteers and staff 
at rape crisis centers, State coalitions 
against sexual assault, culturally specific 
sexual assault organizations, and nonprofit 
organizations across the United States play 
an important role in making crisis hotlines 
and other services available to survivors of 
sexual assault; 
Whereas important partnerships have been 
formed among criminal and juvenile justice 
agencies, health professionals, public health 
workers, educators, first responders, and vic-
tim service providers; 
Whereas free, confidential help is available 
to all victims and survivors of sexual assault 
through— 
(1) the victim service programs of the 
Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network 
(commonly known and referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘RAINN’’), including the Na-
tional Sexual Assault Hotline— 
(A) by telephone at 800–656–HOPE; and 
(B) online at https://hotline.rainn.org; 
and 
(2) more than 1,500 sexual assault service 
providers across the United States; 
Whereas the victim service programs of 
RAINN, including the National Sexual As-
sault Hotline, help more than 300,000 sur-
vivors and their loved ones each year; 
Whereas the Department of Defense pro-
vides the Safe Helpline, Safe HelpRoom, and 
Safe Helpline mobile application, each of 
which provide support and help to members 
of the Department of Defense community— 
(1) by telephone at 877–995–5247; and 
(2) online at https://SafeHelpline.org; 
Whereas individual and collective efforts 
reflect the dream of the people of the United 
States— 
(1) for individuals and organizations to ac-
tively work to prevent all forms of sexual vi-
olence; and 
(2) for no victim of sexual assault to be 
unserved or feel that there is no path to jus-
tice; and 
Whereas April 2022 is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Sexual Assault Awareness and Preven-
tion Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(A) National Sexual Assault Awareness and 
Prevention Month provides a special oppor-
tunity to— 
(i) educate the people of the United States 
about sexual violence; and 
(ii) encourage— 
(I) the prevention of sexual assault; 
(II) improvement in the treatment of sur-
vivors of sexual assault; and 
(III) the prosecution of perpetrators of sex-
ual assault; 
(B) it is appropriate to properly acknowl-
edge survivors of sexual assault and to com-
mend the volunteers and professionals who 
assist those survivors in their efforts to heal; 
(C) national and community organizations 
and private sector supporters should be rec-
ognized and applauded for their work in— 
(i) promoting awareness about sexual as-
sault; 
(ii) providing information and treatment 
to survivors of sexual assault; and 
(iii) increasing the number of successful 
prosecutions of perpetrators of sexual as-
sault; and 
(D) public safety, law enforcement, and 
health professionals should be recognized 
and applauded for their hard work and inno-
vative strategies to ensure perpetrators of 
sexual assault are held accountable; and 
(2) the Senate supports the goals and ideals 
of National Sexual Assault Awareness and 
Prevention Month.

SENATE RESOLUTION 605—DESIG-
NATING APRIL 2022 AS ‘‘SECOND 
CHANCE MONTH’’ 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 605 
Whereas every individual is endowed with 
human dignity and value; 
Whereas redemption and second chances 
are values of the United States; 
Whereas millions of citizens of the United 
States have a criminal record; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals return to their communities from Fed-
eral and State prisons every year; 
Whereas many individuals returning from 
Federal and State prisons have paid their 
debt for committing crimes but still face sig-
nificant legal and societal barriers (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘collateral con-
sequences’’); 
Whereas collateral consequences for an in-
dividual returning from a Federal or State 
prison are often mandatory and take effect 
automatically, regardless of— 
(1) whether there is a nexus between the 
crime and public safety; 
(2) the seriousness of the crime; 
(3) the time that has passed since the indi-
vidual committed the crime; or 
(4) the efforts of the individual to make 
amends or earn back the trust of the public; 
Whereas, for individuals returning to their 
communities from Federal and State pris-
ons, gaining meaningful employment is one 
of the most significant predictors of success-
ful reentry and has been shown to reduce fu-
ture criminal activity; 
Whereas many individuals who have been 
incarcerated struggle to find employment 
and access capital to start a small business 
because of collateral consequences, which 
are often not directly related to the offenses 
the individuals committed or any proven 
public safety benefit; 
Whereas many States have laws that pro-
hibit an individual with a criminal record 
from working in certain industries or obtain-
ing professional licenses; 
Whereas, in addition to employment, edu-
cation has been shown to be a significant 
predictor of successful reentry for individ-
uals returning from Federal and State pris-
ons; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record often has a lower level of educational 
attainment than the general population and 
has significant difficulty acquiring admis-
sion to, and funding for, educational pro-
grams; 
Whereas an individual who has been con-
victed of certain crimes is often barred from 
receiving the financial aid necessary to ac-
quire additional skills and knowledge; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record— 
(1) faces collateral consequences in secur-
ing a place to live; and 
(2) is often barred from seeking access to 
public housing; 
Whereas collateral consequences prevent 
millions of individuals in the United States 
from contributing fully to their families and 
communities; 
Whereas collateral consequences can con-
tribute to recidivism, which increases crime 
and victimization and decreases public safe-
ty; 
Whereas collateral consequences have par-
ticularly impacted underserved communities 
of color and community rates of employ-
ment, housing stability, and recidivism; 
Whereas the inability to find gainful em-
ployment and other collateral consequences 
inhibit the economic mobility of an indi-
vidual with a criminal record, which can 
negatively impact the well-being of the chil-
dren and family of the individual for genera-
tions; 
Whereas the bipartisan First Step Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194) was 
signed into law on December 21, 2018, to in-
crease opportunities for individuals incarcer-
ated in Federal prisons to participate in 
meaningful recidivism reduction programs 
and prepare for their second chances; 
Whereas the programs authorized by the 
Second Chance Act of 2007 (Public Law 110– 
199; 122 Stat. 657)— 
(1) have provided reentry services to more 
than 164,000 individuals in 49 States and the 
District of Columbia since the date of enact-
ment of the Act; and 
(2) were reauthorized by the First Step Act 
of 2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194); 
Whereas the anniversary of the death of 
Charles Colson, who used his second chance 
following his incarceration for a Watergate- 
related crime to found Prison Fellowship, 
the largest program in the United States 
that provides outreach to prisoners, former 
prisoners, and their families, falls on April 
21; and 
Whereas the designation of April as ‘‘Sec-
ond Chance Month’’ may contribute to— 
(1) increased public awareness about— 
(A) 
the 
impact 
of 
collateral 
con-
sequences; and 
(B) the need for closure for individuals 
with a criminal record who have paid their 
debt; and 
(2) opportunities for individuals, employ-
ers, congregations, and communities to ex-
tend second chances to those individuals: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2022 as ‘‘Second Chance 
Month’’; 
(2) honors the work of communities, gov-
ernmental institutions, nonprofit organiza-
tions, congregations, employers, and individ-
uals to remove unnecessary legal and soci-
etal barriers that prevent individuals with 
criminal records from becoming productive 
members of society; and 
(3) calls upon the people of the United 
States to observe ‘‘Second Chance Month’’ 
through actions and programs that— 
(A) promote awareness of those unneces-
sary legal and social barriers; and 
(B) provide closure for individuals with a 
criminal record who have paid their debt.

SBIR & STTR PROGRAMS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about two of the Fed-
eral government’s most important in-
novation programs: the Small Business 
Innovation 
Research 
program, 
also 
known as the SBIR, and the Small 
Business 
Technology 
Transfer 
pro-
gram, or STTR for short. 
It is very appropriate we are having 
this discussion as we are about to go 
into conference in regards to legisla-
tion that affects America’s competi-
tiveness. The SBIR and the STTR pro-
gram represent the best of government 
industry partnerships. 
The programs harness the creativity 
and ingenuity of America’s entre-
preneurs and innovators, solve the 
most pressing public health and na-
tional security challenges of our time. 
The programs are also primed to help 
our Nation rebuild our domestic pro-
duction capacity, to reduce our reli-
ance on foreign supply chains on crit-
ical products, and reduce costs for the 
American people. 
I would like to remind my colleagues 
that fighting inflation and rebuilding 
our domestic manufacturing capacity 
are inextricably linked. 
When factories close, when products 
sit in shipping containers in ports, 
when production capacity decreases 
due to sick employees, and when prod-
ucts take longer to get from the ware-
house to the store, prices go up. 
I have no doubt that every Senator 
has heard from businesses in all sectors 
of the economy about solving this crit-
ical issue. 
According to a recent survey the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
ness conducted, more than half of all 
small business owners reported a sig-
nificant impact due to supply chain 
disruptions. 
Thirty percent reported that the dis-
ruptions were causing a ‘‘moderate im-
pact,’’ and 14 percent reported a ‘‘mild 
impact.’’ Only 5 percent of those sur-
veyed reported that they were unaf-
fected by the disruptions. Of the small 
business owners affected by disrup-
tions, 80 percent reported that the dis-
ruptions have caused them to miss out 
on business opportunities. 
I am very pleased to hear that Presi-
dent Biden announced during his State 
of the Union address that rebuilding 
America’s domestic production capac-
ity is central to his administration’s 
plan to fight inflation and keep our Na-
tion secure. 
SBIR and STTR are two of the best 
tools in the Federal government’s tool-
kit to achieve our goal. Congress cre-
ated the SBIR in 1982 to increase the 
participation of small businesses and 
Federally funded research and develop-
ment opportunities in areas ranging 
from clean energy to advanced manu-
facturing. 
Under the program, Federal agencies 
that budget at least $100 million annu-
ally for outside research must allocate 
a portion—3.2 percent since fiscal year 
2017—to support R&D and small busi-
nesses. 
There are 11 Federal agencies and de-
partments currently in the program, 
including the Department of Defense, 
Department of Energy, Department of 
Education, and Health and Human 
Services. The program awards funds in 
three phases: 
Phase 1 awards are worth up to 
$225,000 and may be used to conduct a 
feasibility study to determine an idea’s 
scientific and commercial promise. 
Phase 2 awards up to $1.5 million and 
may be used to conduct further R&D on 
the feasibility of turning an idea into a 
commercial product. 
And phase 3 does not involve an 
award of funds, but denotes that an 
idea is ready to move from the labora-
tory to the marketplace. 
During the commercialization phase, 
small businesses must raise funding 
from the private sector or secure non- 
SBIR Federal funds. 
Congress created the STTR program 
in 1992. While the program is similar to 
the SBIR in structure, utilizing a simi-
lar three-phase progression, the STTR 
awards go to small businesses engaging 
in collaborative R&D with Federal 
labs, as well as nonprofit educational 
and scientific institutions. 
The program requires Federal agen-
cies and departments to spend at least 
$1 billion on outside research to allo-
cate at least 0.45 percent of the funds 
to STTR opportunities. 
Most people may not be familiar with 
SBIR or STTR, but they definitely rec-
ognize the products and companies in 
the programs that it helped create. 
Sonicare Electric toothbrush, iRobot, 
Lasik eye surgery, all received SBIR/ 
STTR 
funding 
when 
they 
were 
startups. 
Qualcomm, 
which 
makes 
computer chips, semiconductors, and 
other technologies critical to our na-
tional communication infrastructure, 
also received funding from these pro-
grams. Progeny Systems, a small busi-
ness based in Manassas, VA, received 
more than 300 SBIR and STTR awards 
to conduct research over a 20-year pe-
riod. Progeny’s research produced tech-
nology that drastically improves the 
Navy’s torpedo capacity. The company 
is now the sole supplier of torpedos to 
the Navy; and, yes, it is still a small 
business. 
This is another benefit of these pro-
grams: They expand and diversify the 
supplier base from which the Federal 
agencies source goods and services, in-
creasing competition and investment 
in high-growth sectors, which reduce 
costs over time. 
On the manufacturing front, several 
agencies, including NASA and the De-
partment of Defense, are currently 
funding research on advanced manufac-
turing techniques, such as 3D printing 
and glass that can handle temperatures 
as high as 900 degrees, which would rev-
olutionize our ability to monitor nu-
clear reactors and power plant furnaces 
to prevent accidents. 
Simply put, SBIR and STTR are in-
valuable to our national security, and 
we should fund these programs ade-
quately to rebuild our domestic supply 
chain. Unfortunately, authority for 
these critical programs will expire at 
the end of September unless Congress 
acts to extend them. 
The House and Senate will go to con-
ference soon on America COMPETES 
Act, which includes a 5-year extension 
of SBIR and STTR. I urge all my col-
leagues, especially those who will be 
conferees, to support this critical pro-
vision. 
The junior Senator from Iowa has 
submitted a motion to instruct con-
ferees to couple this effort to extend 
the SBIR program and the STTR pro-
gram by 5 years with authorizing lan-
guage to prevent China and Russia 
from acquiring critical national secu-
rity technology developed by the pro-
gram. 
I agree with the Senator that the 
United States needs to safeguard tech-
nologies from being compromised and 
stolen, and I am pleased that the House 
Competes Act bill includes safeguards 
to prevent our adversaries from affect-
ing our innovation—not just China and 
Russia, but all foreign countries of con-
cern, including Iran and North Korea. 
This effort builds off of section 223 of 
the fiscal year 2021 National Defense 
Authorization Act that provides pro-
tections and requires disclosure to 
guard against foreign influence on Fed-
erally funded research and develop-
ment. 
So I will support the motion the Sen-
ator from Iowa will make; but we must 
recognize that if we are able to com-
pete with China and Russia, extending 
the authorization for SBIR and STTR 
are critical. I hope she will work with 
me to keep this important program 
from shutting its doors on September 
30. 
I would like to add that this issue is 
very important to my constituents in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2226 
April 28, 2022 
Maryland. Our State ranks number one 
in the Nation in R&D spending due to 
the presence of Federal and academic 
research institutions such as the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology, Johns Hopkins University, and 
the University of Maryland. 
I have had many discussions with 
State government officials and leading 
scientists in Maryland who have told 
me that one of the most sensible steps 
we can take to improve the SBIR and 
STTR program were to make these pro-
grams permanent. The research SBIR 
and STTR funds often continues for 
several years before producing a prod-
uct ready to go to the market. Re-
searchers need to know that these pro-
grams will not disappear in the middle 
of years-long research projects. 
It is our responsibility to make sure 
that we act timely so that there is no 
lapse in these programs or reduced 
funding that is critically needed for 
these programs’ success. 
Any such action would be short-
sighted and would have a devastating 
impact on small businesses engaged in 
cutting-edge research Nationwide. Re-
ducing the size of these programs or al-
lowing them to lapse altogether would 
hinder our efforts to restore the pro-
duction of critical products. 
I recently convened a hearing of the 
Senate Small Business Committee to 
examine the impacts of supply chain 
disruptions on small businesses. One of 
our witnesses, Dr. Sridhar Kota, who 
leads an organization that advocates 
for increased public and private sector 
investment 
in 
America’s 
manufac-
turing sector, called the SBIR and the 
STTR ‘‘one of the really good tools in 
the toolbox’’ and urged the committee 
to strengthen the programs to support 
even more researchers. I could not 
agree more. 
Instead of leaving the researchers 
who are inventing the tools that will 
power the economy of the future guess-
ing about the SBIR and STTR, we in 
Congress have an opportunity—and I 
would say an obligation—to reauthor-
ize these programs before they expire 
in September. We should also make 
them permanent, which both the Pen-
tagon and NASA have urged us to do. 
This is in our national security inter-
est, as well as our economic interest 
and fairness to small businesses. 
Arthur C. Clarke wrote: 
New ideas pass through three periods: (1) It 
can’t be done. (2) It probably can be done, 
but it’s not worth doing. (3) I knew it was a 
good idea all along. 
The SBIR and the STTR programs 
help 
visionary 
entrepreneurs 
get 
through one and two to reach three. 
Getting 
to 
three 
makes 
America 
stronger and more prosperous. 
Let us make sure that we act in 
time. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 
Mr. 
CASSIDY. 
Madam 
President, 
every Senator, when she or he goes 
home, speaks to families feeling the 
crushing burden of inflation, in large 
part driven by fuel prices—it is cer-
tainly true when I go home to Lou-
isiana—and they hope for a better job; 
one, they would like a better job, but, 
two, they need the extra money in 
order to keep up with the inflation. 
There is a connection with their per-
sonal economic concerns, Putin’s war 
in Ukraine, and China doing their best 
to take American jobs by ignoring en-
vironmental 
standards, 
using 
slave 
labor, giving subsidies to the busi-
nesses, making it almost impossible for 
American businesses to work here and 
compete with products made in China. 
As one example of just how success-
ful China has been, in the early 2000s, 
China was about 19th and 20th in manu-
facturing and carbon emissions. 
Since then, since the early 2000s, 
China has become No. 1 worldwide, 
both in the amount of manufacturing 
but also in the amount of their carbon 
emissions. 
Indeed, the increase in carbon emis-
sions for China is more than the com-
bined decrease of the United States, 
the EU, and the United Kingdom in 
that same period of time. 
We have been doing our best to im-
prove our environmental standards for 
the benefit of the whole world, and 
China has exploited that, using their 
lack of enforcement of standards to at-
tract our jobs to their country, and yet 
our global greenhouse gas emissions 
are worse off. 
Now, as I mentioned, the inflation, 
the hope for a better job, which is not 
realized, Putin’s war, using energy as a 
national security tool, and China’s con-
certed strategy are all interwoven. 
There is a nexus, and that nexus is be-
tween energy and the climate, the 
economy of a family and of a nation, 
and national security. 
So if we are going to improve the fi-
nancial situation for that family in 
Louisiana, a working family in Nevada, 
or any of our States and do something 
about our national security concerns, 
then we must do something about en-
ergy, and that is related to emissions. 
The most effective way of doing this 
is looking at how China addresses their 
emissions and how the United States 
does. 
Now, when I speak of emissions, I 
speak of the fact that we now use nat-
ural gas instead of coal, and natural 
gas burns much more cleanly than 
coal, and so, therefore, we have cleaner 
air in the United States than we did 
even 20 years ago. 
But China uses coal for about 60 per-
cent of their energy feedstock. And so 
to understand China as a competitor, 
let’s look at their economic, geo-
political, and national security strate-
gies against us, and we are going to 
look at it through the prism of carbon 
emissions because if we think about 
national security without thinking 
about energy and the associated emis-
sions, if we don’t think about them all 
at the same time, we are wasting our 
time, just wasting our time. So, again, 
examining as a nexus. 
There is a petrochemical plant in 
Louisiana that has invested heavily in 
lowering their emissions. We pay a lit-
tle extra for the products they produce, 
but we accept that extra cost so that 
we have this cleaner environment. 
Just as an example, the plastic that 
is on the back of my phone, that plas-
tic is made from natural gas usually, 
and the process of making that has rig-
orous 
environmental 
standards 
to 
make sure that we protect those who 
live around the plant. China does not 
do that. They do not enforce those 
standards, nor, as I mentioned earlier, 
do they use natural gas. They are much 
more likely to use coal, and they pref-
erentially build their powerplants on 
the Pacific coast of China. So the emis-
sions go into the atmosphere, and they 
blow across the Pacific, and they land 
in the United States. Much of the prob-
lems of the west coast of the United 
States with SOX
and NOX
are from 
plants that originate their emissions in 
China. 
And did I say it lowers their cost of 
production by not enforcing those? By 
lowering the cost of production, you 
attract American jobs away from the 
United States of America over there. 
And did I say it strengthens their econ-
omy? And by strengthening their econ-
omy, they have more money to invest 
in their military and more money to 
pursue 
their 
geopolitical 
strategy, 
which is to undermine the influence of 
the United States of America. 
By not applying our emission stand-
ards to China, giving them a free pass, 
we are allowing them to implement 
their strategy. 
Now, by the way, I am not against 
international trade. We can look at the 
treaties we have with Canada and with 
Mexico or with Central American coun-
tries, and we can see that there are cer-
tain labor and environmental stand-
ards that are embedded in those. And it 
is an even playing field, of sorts. So if 
we have a clean air standard here in 
the United States, there is something 
like that in Mexico and something like 
that in Canada. If we have labor stand-
ards here, we have something like that 
in Honduras and something like that in 
Guatemala. So we are still competing, 
but the playing field is more even. 
Now, there are other benefits of trad-
ing in the Western Hemisphere. 
About 40 percent of the goods that 
Mexico produces are reimported from 
the United States. There is an ex-
change that goes back so that the rev-
enue that is produced in trade dis-
proportionately comes from Mexico

back to the United States. So while 
that number is 40 percent with Mexico, 
it is only 4 percent with China. And it 
is not like we are sending all this 
money to China. We had about a $355 
billion trade deficit with them last 
year. And I am not talking about the 
deficit; I am just saying that only 4 
percent of that revenue comes back to 
the United States in order to reinvest 
in the American economy. 
So I am all for trade, but I want to 
have something which is more mutu-
ally beneficial and one in which there 
is a level playing field and one in which 
the disregard for environmental stand-
ards is not used as a strategy to strip 
jobs away from Americans in order to 
improve an economy of a competitor 
that uses that money to improve their 
military standing and uses that money 
to undermine our influence and, by the 
way, to attempt to expand their geo-
political viewpoint. 
Now, I will say once more, I love cap-
italism. It has the ability to elevate 
people out of poverty. Three genera-
tions ago, my family left Ireland and 
came to the United States because 
they didn’t have enough to eat, and be-
cause this is the greatest capitalist 
country in the world, my family did 
quite well because of the system of 
government we have here. I am not ar-
guing against that. 
But what we cannot tolerate is the 
arbitrage of rules that are put in place 
by developed countries to protect not 
just our own citizens but the global en-
vironment from the ill effects of cer-
tain types of activities, say, in this 
case, burning energy. 
If we are going to equalize the play-
ing field, if you will, to lawfully and 
peacefully defeat a strategy which has 
explicit goals to take jobs from the 
United States of America and to 
eclipse us as a world power, we need to 
think strategically as to how to defeat 
this strategy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TERESA GRAY AND 
RECOGNIZING 
MOBILE 
MEDICS 
INTERNATIONAL 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to say that it is Thursday, and it 
is my favorite time of week, 6 years’ 
strong—almost 7 years—we have been 
doing our ‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ se-
ries, and we love to do this because we 
get to recognize a special Alaskan, 
someone who makes the State very 
special. 
Our pages, I think they don’t always 
admit it, but it is probably the best 
speech of the week because it is inter-
esting and we have got some cool sto-
ries. I know some of the reporters here 
like the speech because it means we are 
at the end of the week so that is good. 
Today, we are honoring a really 
amazing Alaskan. Her name is Teresa 
Gray, of Anchorage, who was, by the 
way, recently featured by CNN as one 
of their heroes for the work her organi-
zation does that Teresa founded to pro-
vide medical help to people all over the 
globe. 
So, before I talk about Teresa and 
her amazing work, I always like to give 
a little update of what is going on in 
Alaska right now. I was home the last 
couple weeks traveling all over the 
State, and it didn’t seem like too long 
ago when I had said: Hey, winter is 
coming. Winter is coming. Well, here is 
the good news. Well, I love winter, but 
winter is now leaving. It is leaving 
Alaska. 
Now, it is cold in many places. My 
house in Anchorage still has snow on 
the ground, but the Sun is now up high 
in the sky, staying up longer and 
longer every single day—although I 
was in Fairbanks and we had northern 
lights going. So that was awesome just 
last week. But today, in Anchorage, 
the Sun rose at 6 a.m. and set around 10 
p.m. So it is getting long. It is gaining. 
We gain about 5 minutes a day during 
this time of the year. Birds are migrat-
ing back by the tens of thousands. The 
excitement of spring is everywhere. 
So to everybody watching, if you are 
thinking about great summer travel 
plans, Alaska is the place to be. So 
come on up. We would love to have 
you. 
So, now, let me talk about Teresa 
Gray and the organization she founded 
called Mobile Medics International, 
which is doing great work across the 
globe, even as we speak. 
Teresa is originally from Michigan. 
As a paramedic, she moved to Alaska 
in 1999 to be with her then-husband 
who was from Alaska. And like so 
many do when they come to Alaska, 
she fell in love with Alaska. Now, she 
wasn’t really an outdoorsy type, but 
she said: 
I just felt at home. 
It is the people that she loves. She 
said the State has such a unique group 
of individuals. 
We [all] share a kindred spirit. We’re all 
committed to living the Alaska[n] way. 
That is what Teresa said. And for Te-
resa, the Alaskan way has been to put 
her medical skills to use. Now, ini-
tially, she worked as an instructor at 
the only paramedic school in the State, 
but within 6 months, she bought the 
school and created two additional 
schools, one in Fairbanks and one in 
Wasilla, and made these very success-
ful. Eight years later, she sold those to 
the University of Alaska. 
Then she became a flight medic for 
AeroMed, now known as LifeMed. She 
was a medical trainer for the Alaska 
Air National Guard unit, the 210th Res-
cue Squadron. These are very brave, in-
trepid PJs who do amazing work all 
over the State. And she also helped out 
with the Anchorage Fire Department. 
When they again adopted a child, 
their second adopted child, Teresa de-
cided it was time to retire. An aside 
here—one of Teresa’s children, Boyd 
Jorgensen, was a U.S. marine under my 
command, with the great unit ECHO 
Company 4th Reconnaissance Battalion 
up in Anchorage. So Semper Fi, Staff 
Sergeant. I hope you are watching. 
Let’s talk about your mom. 
That retirement for Teresa didn’t 
last long. One day, she was watching 
the news, and she saw the image—and I 
think a lot of us remember this 
image—of a 3-year-old Syrian refugee 
on the beach of Lesbos, face down in 
the water. It was very powerful. People 
all over the world saw that really 
ghastly image. She thought: Why isn’t 
anybody doing anything about this? 
She realized, well, she should and she 
could. So she volunteered for an Irish 
medical nonprofit which took her to 
Greece and then to other places across 
the globe. 
It didn’t take her long to see a need 
that wasn’t being filled. There are a 
great many medical nonprofits, but the 
general model is that the doctors and 
other medical professionals arrive at a 
place and set up shop. The people in 
need of care come to them. 
But there are so many times Teresa 
witnessed people who couldn’t leave 
their communities. In the case of Puer-
to Rico, there was a mudslide with lim-
ited access to a road that led to a vil-
lage which hadn’t received medical or 
any kind of help in over a week. People 
couldn’t get a doctor there. 
So, back in Alaska, she put a call out 
on social media, and soon, Mobile Med-
ics International was born. The group 
is focused on mobility, on getting to 
the barrios, to the villages, up in the 
mountains—hard places to get to, 
where she said that ‘‘[s]o many places 
are lost or forgotten in disasters’’ be-
cause they are so hard to get to. 
Roughly, 5 years later, the group now 
has roughly 120 volunteers from across 
the globe, including from Alaska, on 
nearly every continent. They have been 
on over 30 missions. They are agile. 
They are expeditionary. They are like 
the Marines. When they go to a place 
that has been hit by disaster or to a 
place experiencing a refugee crisis, ev-
erything they need is in a backpack. 
Teresa said: 
We can bring our own food, our own water, 
our own sleeping accommodations. We try to 
take basically an ambulance in the back-
pack. 
Great image. Great idea. 
If someone requires more extensive 
care, then they help get that individual 
to a medical facility, maybe in another 
part of the country. 
In addition to natural and humani-
tarian disasters, Mobile Medics Inter-
national also trains people in medi-
cally underserved villages to provide 
treatment to others in their commu-
nities. So it is train the trainer. Teach 
someone to fish. 
They find people in those commu-
nities who are willing to commit to 5 
years to build their own program in 
that community, and they support 
them during that time. They visit a 
few times a year, get them equipped, 
get them supplies, get them training,

and then, all of a sudden, you have peo-
ple in those communities who have 
these medical skills. 
Teresa talked about her team once 
going to a remote island in the Phil-
ippines where, because of a lack of nu-
trition, this remote island and the pop-
ulation had a really bad problem with 
cleft-palate 
babies. 
‘‘Within 
three 
years,’’ she said, ‘‘we eliminated cleft- 
palate babies on that island by giving 
out prenatal vitamins.’’ 
Think about that. That is incredible 
work—one American with a vision 
making a huge difference in a place 
like the Philippines. Great work. 
So let’s fast-forward to today. Where 
do you think she is? Where do you 
think they are? 
Well, they are on the frontlines in 
Ukraine and Romania to help with the 
refugee crisis there. They have four 
teams there. They are providing a 24- 
hour clinic in Romania and go person- 
to-person to help with medical care. 
They have organized a warehouse of do-
nated goods. They have delivered sup-
plies into Ukraine, and they are pro-
viding emotional support to people who 
really need it because of the barbaric 
invasion that has happened there. 
For Teresa and her group, helping 
during a refugee crisis is particularly 
emotional and wrenching. She said: 
Natural disasters can be horrific. A refugee 
crisis is even more emotionally difficult. 
These are people who have lost every-
thing, including their country, their 
heritage, and their language. 
She talked about how the Ukrainian 
refugee crisis is particularly chal-
lenging. ‘‘All the men have been left 
behind,’’ she said. You just have moth-
ers, older men, young girls, and women 
whose entire life in Ukraine is now 
gone. 
Her people do more than just medical 
care. They provide emotional support 
as well. When she traveled to Romania, 
there was an elderly woman whom she 
was treating for health issues. The 
woman asked for a different kind of 
help. She asked that she and her son be 
driven to the border so she could see 
Ukraine for the last time—a Ukrainian 
woman just wanting to see her coun-
try—and Teresa did that. 
‘‘She asked for help, so we gave it to 
her,’’ Teresa said. 
This is a great example of the drive, 
determination, vision, and hard work 
of just one person. Think about it. One 
person, Teresa Gray, with a vision— 
and how that vision and drive can 
change lives—hundreds of lives, thou-
sands of lives. 
So, Teresa, thank you for providing 
so much help to so many. Congratula-
tions for being chosen as a CNN hero; 
but more importantly, much more im-
portantly—sorry, 
CNN—congratula-
tions on being our Alaskan of the 
Week. You have really, really deserved 
it and made us all proud. 
I yield the floor.

SHERPA HOUSE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Sherpa House Res-
taurant and Cultural Center for winning the 
Golden Rotary’s 2022 Ethics in Business 
Award. 
Each year, the Golden Rotary Club awards 
one for-profit company and one non-profit or-
ganization for their outstanding ethical behav-
ior and leadership. The community is asked to 
nominate organizations whom they think dis-
play the highest standards of ethical business 
practices, integrity, and civic and social re-
sponsibility. Winners are then chosen by stu-
dents in an Ethics class at the Colorado 
School of Mines. 
As a longtime, local restaurant and cultural 
center in the heart of Golden, the Sherpa 
House has a history of welcoming residents 
and customers from across the region to dis-
cover the wonders of the Himalayas and learn 
about the history and customs of Sherpas. 
This establishment has served as an exhi-
bition of the vibrancy and depth of Sherpa and 
Nepalese culture since 2009. Despite being a 
small company, they contribute substantially to 
the Golden community and have been a true 
ethical beacon for businesses. It’s clear the 
Sherpa House owners and staff care deeply 
for the Nepalese community in Colorado and 
in Nepal and want to share that vibrant culture 
with the community. 
Congratulations to the Sherpa House Res-
taurant and Cultural Center on receiving this 
award from the Golden Rotary Club and I 
thank them for their ethical leadership and on-
going contributions to our community.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
MAXIMUS 
CLOSSON 
ON 
HIS 
OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO AT-
TEND THE UNITED STATES MILI-
TARY ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Maximus Closson of Northwood, Ohio, has 
been offered an appointment to the United 
States Military Academy in West Point, New 
York. 
Max’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Military Academy this 
fall with the incoming Class of 2026. Attending 
one of our nation’s military academies not only 
offers the opportunity to serve our country, but 
also guarantees a world-class education while 
undertaking one of the most challenging and 
rewarding experiences of their lives. 
Max brings a tremendous amount of leader-
ship, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Northwood 
High School in Northwood, Ohio, Max partici-
pated in student government, Quiz Bowl, and 
was a member of National Honor Society. 
Throughout high school, Max was involved 
with cross country and track and field, earning 
varsity letters in both. I am confident that Max 
will carry the lessons of his student and ath-
letic leadership to the Military Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Maximus Closson on his 
offer of appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Max will excel during 
his career at the Military Academy, and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in extending their 
best wishes to him as he begins his service to 
our Nation.

RECOGNIZING THE CRAIG FAMILY 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exceptional family from 
my district. Since 1947, the Craig family has 
run Craig’s Brother Bar-B-Q, dazzling De Valls 
Bluff with mouthwatering pork sandwiches 
dripping in the secret family sauce known for 
its hints of apple and bell pepper. 
Lawrence Craig, a former cook on a Mis-
sissippi River boat and his brother Wes 
opened the restaurant in 1947. Now with three 
generations of the Craig family maintaining the 
barbeque tradition, Craig’s Brother Bar-B-Q 
was recognized as a 2019 Arkansas Food Hall 
of Fame Award Winner. 
Craig’s offers slow-smoked meats covered 
in curated levels of spicy sauces, perfected 
coleslaw, ribs, and burgers that will make you 
feel like you are in Southern barbeque heav-
en. A local favorite, duck hunters frequent the 
family-run establishment that was also recog-
nized as a 2020 People’s Choice Nominee. 
For a blast of flavor and unforgettable taste 
of the South, visit Craig’s Brother Bar-B-Q.

HONORING JEFF SIMERING ON RE-
TIREMENT FROM THE COUNCIL 
OF THE GREAT CITY SCHOOLS 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, 
last month, one of the most impactful and con-
sistent forces in urban education policy retired. 
Jeff Simering stepped down as the Director of 
Legislative Services for the Council of the 
Great City Schools, ending his fifth decade of 
working to improve schools in urban school 
districts. His impact on education, and espe-
cially those who have taught and learned in 
our urban schools, has been immeasurable. 
Jeff had been with the Council since 1994, 
where he directed the federal legislative activi-
ties of the Council, worked with federal agen-
cies, and advised member school districts on 
the implementation of national legislation. Prior 
to joining the Council, Jeff operated a con-
sulting firm that aided school districts and 
worked directly for Chicago Public Schools. 
Jeff received his law degree from the Univer-
sity of Baltimore. 
Jeff fought for urban schools to get the re-
sources they needed for decades. While at 
Chicago Public Schools, Jeff worked with 
some of the legislative titans of the time—Sid 
Yates and Dan Rostenkowski—to ensure Chi-
cago Public Schools had the resources to sup-
port its students and teachers and foster diver-
sity. Throughout the 90s and beyond Jeff was 
one of the preeminent experts helping guide 
Congress on how best to target federal edu-
cation funding to the school districts which 
needed it the most. 
Jeff provided counsel to Members of the 
Education and Labor Committee for decades. 
His advice helped inform us on how to target 
resources and pursue reforms to strengthen 
schools. Most importantly his advice assisted 
us in producing more effective legislation. For 
instance, Jeff was instrumental in helping the 
Committee construct funding formulas that en-
sured school districts with concentrations of 
low-income children in rural, urban and subur-
ban America received their fair share of re-
sources. 
Jeff fiercely represented his clients—urban 
schools and the children who attend them. 
And above all, Jeff knew how to help the 
Committee come to a bipartisan consensus on 
issues. For example, Jeff’s assistance led to 
bipartisan agreement on multiple Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act reauthoriza-
tions, 
including 
the 
Improving 
America’s 
Schools Act in 1994, the No Child Left Behind 
Act in 2001, and the Every Student Succeeds 
Act in 2015. His work also influenced the re-
authorizations of the Individuals with Disabil-
ities Education Act in 1997 and 2004, and the 
Career and Technical Education Act in 1998 
and 2006. 
Best wishes to Jeff on his retirement. His 
knowledge and approach will be missed. I 
hope in the coming months and years, he will 
be able to spend more time with his family, 
play tennis, and ride his Harley. 
I thank him for all he has done to support 
our Nation’s schools.

HONORING ALDEA CHILDREN AND 
FAMILY SERVICES 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Aldea Children 
and Family Services in celebration of the orga-
nization’s 50 years of service in Napa and So-
lano counties. 
Aldea has specialized in helping people who 
face financial, mental, cultural, and other bar-
riers in their lives. The organization provides 
mental health services, transitional housing, 
child welfare services, and substance abuse 
services in Napa and Solano counties. The 
dedicated workers at Aldea assist our commu-
nities through three main offices, various out-
patient therapy clinics, and over 30 co-loca-
tions, including schools, primary healthcare fa-
cilities, and community-based organizations. 
Aldea incorporated in 1972, opening its first 
group home which served as a residence for 
six teenage girls. Two years later, it opened 
the Redwood Residential Treatment Center to 
house eight teenagers. In 1982, Aldea ex-
panded its services to adults with develop-
mental disabilities who live independently. A 
few years later, Aldea grew by opening a 
group home in Solano County. In 1987, Aldea 
yet again expanded its services by becoming 
a licensed private Foster Family Agency. 
In 2007, Aldea began offering Intensive 
Treatment Foster Care for children with severe 
behavioral and mental health issues. Later, 
the organization began offering substance 
abuse prevention and treatment services for 
youth in Napa County. Aldea was certified by 
the Council on Accreditation for their effective 
programming and organizational management 
in both 2012 and 2016. This honor is achieved 
by only one percent of human service agen-
cies in the nation. 
Aldea Children and Family Services grew 
from a group home for adolescents to a multi- 
service organization that serves over 3,900 
people each year, providing necessary serv-
ices that help patients reclaim their lives. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Aldea 
Children and Family Services have served the 
people of Napa and Solano counties well for 
over 50 years.

ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Ethan Collins of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, has 
been offered an appointment to the United 
States Military Academy in West Point, New 
York. 
Ethan’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Military Academy this 
fall with the incoming Class of 2026. Attending 
one of our nation’s military academies not only 
offers the opportunity to serve our country, but 
also guarantees a world-class education while 
undertaking one of the most challenging and 
rewarding experiences of their lives. 
Ethan brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Upper San-
dusky High School in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, 
Ethan participated in student government, 
Quiz Bowl, and was a member of the Ohio At-
torney General’s Teen Ambassador Board. 
Throughout high school, Ethan was involved 
with golf, swimming, and tennis, earning var-
sity letters in all three. I am confident that 
Ethan will carry the lessons of his student and 
athletic leadership to the Military Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Ethan Collins on his offer 
of appointment to the United States Military 
Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-
est military training and education available. I 
am positive that Ethan will excel during his ca-
reer at the Military Academy, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in extending their best 
wishes to him as he begins his service to our 
Nation.

Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Chief Deputy James Nelson Bailey

Chief Bailey began his career with the 
Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office in 1995. He 
worked in the Detention Center for two years 
before becoming a member of the Patrol divi-
sion in 1997. It was not long before his exper-
tise and quick success led him to be promoted

ant in 2006. After twelve years of dedicated 
service as Patrol Lieutenant, he was ap-
pointed Chief Deputy in 2018. Chief Bailey is

ceived his bachelor’s degree in Criminal Jus-
tice Administration from Western Carolina Uni-

Chief Bailey’s hard work and staunch work 
ethic have long promoted service of the high-
est quality to further assist the Cabarrus 
County Sheriff’s Office benefit all in our com-
munity. In addition to such dedicated service, 
he is an active member of his community out-
side of his role as Chief Deputy. He is the

forcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s 
legacy alive through officers who share his 
same admirable and commendable spirit in 
Cabarrus County. Chief Bailey fits the mold of 
esteemed law enforcement officers in our 
community set by Robert Eury. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Chief Deputy James Nelson 
Bailey for receiving the 2021 Robert Jackson 
Eury Memorial Award. We all wish him well as

IN RECOGNITION OF THE STUDENT 
COUNCIL 
OF 
RAGLAND 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Student Council 
of Ragland High School. 
In October, the Council, led by President 
Jaxon Phillips, called for U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) to fund the Ragland 
Safety, Transportation, Education, and Mobility 
Project, known as ‘‘STEM.’’ 
Trains often block Ragland’s only grade 
crossing, cutting the town in half for hours. 
This blocks first responders and school buses 
and causes disruptions for student attendance 
and learning. The STEM Project would elimi-
nate these disruptions. 
At the Student Council’s urging, I have en-
gaged with U.S. DOT to support this project. 
I had hoped funding for this project would be 
announced by Secretary Buttigieg before the 
school year ended. While the final decision is 
still pending, I want these young leaders to 
know their voices have been heard in Wash-
ington. I will continue to support the STEM 
Project. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon Secretary 
Buttigieg to fund this worthy project. I include 
in the RECORD the text of the Council’s resolu-
tion of October 25, 2021.

Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Brendan Degryse of Bryan, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Mili-

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
ASSEMBLYMEMBER 
BILL 
DUPLISSEA 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my good friend from 
the 
Bay 
Area, 
the 
late 
Honorable 
Bill 
Duplissea, who served in the California As-
sembly, worked as a well-known lobbyist, and 
served on numerous boards and commissions 
throughout his life. 
At a young age, Bill displayed leadership 
and ambition both on and off the football field 
playing for multiple universities, in the Cana-
dian professional football league, and then be-
coming a businessman with dry cleaning and 
truck trailer companies. 
Although Bill had been a Democrat, he ran 
for office as a Republican in 1986, and won, 
becoming one of the last Republicans to rep-
resent the Bay Area. Although he only served 
one term, Bill continued to make an impact in 
the halls of Sacramento by serving on various 
boards and positions, including as administra-
tive director for the state’s Division of Workers’ 
Compensation under Governor Pete Wilson, 
and as an appointee to the Metropolitan 
Transportation Commission. Bill will always be 
fondly remembered for working across the 
aisle and lighting up any room he walked into 
with his joy and charm. 
Bill later became a lobbyist who was known 
for being a fair and upfront advocate for his 
clients. Public servants and lawmakers trusted 
Bill because he provided balanced perspec-
tives into his clients—being honest about both 
the good, and the bad. Among other things, 
he represented the pawn shop industry, taking 
a business that might be hard to put a positive 
spin on and making them feel more relatable 
and human. Bill was dedicated to his craft and 
made sure members knew all parts of his cli-
ents, including by conducting numerous site 
tours. Bill was a strong advocate for small 
businesses and issues related to veterans. 
Bill’s dedication to policy was also reflected 
in his commitment to his family and apprecia-
tion for sports. Bill enjoyed spending time and 
going on trips with his wife, Sharon; daughter; 
Eleanor; and son; Bill. 
Bill was a dedicated husband, loyal friend, 
and a unifying public servant. He is affection-
ately remembered by his loved ones, friends, 
colleagues, and community. 
Today, Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize the Honorable Bill Duplissea. I am 
proud to have called him a friend. May he rest 
in peace.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF DENNIS 
GALLAGHER 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with my colleagues, Congress-
man ED PERLMUTTER, Congressman JASON 
CROW, and Congressman JOE NEGUSE, to rec-
ognize one of Denver’s most beloved public 
servants, Dennis Gallagher, who passed away 
earlier this month at the age of 82. 
Dennis’s lifelong passion for wanting to 
change people’s lives for the better can be 
traced to his earliest days. Born in north Den-
ver in 1939, just as the Great Depression was 
ending, to first generation Irish American par-
ents, Dennis saw firsthand the hard struggles 
many families faced merely trying to survive. 
And those early experiences shaped him. He 
felt called to a life of constant learning, teach-
ing, and advocating on behalf of others. 
After receiving his bachelor’s degree from 
Regis University in 1961, Dennis set out to 
Washington, D.C., where he earned his mas-
ter’s degree from Catholic University in 1967. 
Afterwards, when he returned home to Den-
ver, Dennis began working as a professor at 
his alma mater Regis University, where he 
would spend more than 40 years teaching and 
mentoring students in speech, classical lan-
guages, persuasion, and media. 
Early in his career as an educator, Dennis 
also discovered he could positively affect peo-
ple’s lives through politics, so he ran for office 
and won. First elected to Colorado’s state 
House of Representatives in 1970, Dennis 
spent two terms representing his community in 
the state House before moving to the state 
Senate where he would serve the people of 
his district for the next 20 years. As a senator, 
Dennis notably worked to pass the ‘‘Gallagher 
Amendment’’ to the state’s constitution, a pol-
icy that set limits on property taxes for home-
owners and renters. Dennis eventually went 
on to serve his community as a member of the 
Denver City Council beginning in 1995, and 
then as the city’s auditor starting in 2003, a 
position he held for more than a decade until 
his retirement in 2015. 
Everyone who knew Dennis, including each 
of us, could describe him in at least two ways. 
First, Dennis was a larger-than-life figure who 
never hesitated to speak his mind or make 
friends with someone new. It cannot be over-
stated that Dennis was extremely well known, 
not just in Denver but across our state as well. 
In fact, the power of Dennis’s outgoing per-
sonality was key to his success in public serv-
ice. At every level of government that he 
served, Dennis earned the respect and sup-
port of both his colleagues and his constitu-
ents. 
Second, anyone who knew Dennis could tell 
you he was deeply proud of his Irish heritage. 
He was famous for hosting St. Patrick’s Day 
celebrations, complete with musicians and 
step dancers. And though he maintained close 
ties with Colorado’s Irish community, Dennis 
always made room to learn more about people 
from different backgrounds with diverse per-
spectives. 
Truly, there will never be another Dennis 
Gallagher. Those of us who knew him well are 
grateful for the time we got to spend with him, 
and we will be forever thankful for his service 
to our community. He was a legendary leader, 
teacher, and friend to all of us, including me 
and my family. 
As our community mourns the loss of a true 
giant, we offer our heartfelt condolences to 
Dennis’s family and friends, especially to his 
son Daniel Gallagher and his brother Tim Gal-
lagher. Dennis Gallagher will be sorely 
missed, but it’s quite clear that his legacy will 
endure for many years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE JONES FAMILY 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exceptional family from 
my district. Since 1910, the Jones Family has 
owned and operated the award-winning and 
nationally recognized Jones BBQ restaurant in 
Marianna, Arkansas. Today, owner James H. 
Jones, the great-nephew of founder ‘‘Uncle’’ 
Joe Jones, continues to serve mouthwatering 
barbeque and a secret family barbeque sauce 
to customers who come from as far away as 
England, Germany, and even Yemen. 
However, the secret to the success of Jones 
BBQ is in the simplicity. Mr. Jones, 4 times a 
week, places multiple pork shoulders on the 
grill in the back of the restaurant, leaving them 
to smoke for 10 to 12 hours. Then, he wakes 
up early the next morning to prepare them for 
customers and serves the barbeque until he 
sells out. If you do not get to Jones BBQ be-
fore noon, there is a good chance all the 
barbeque will be gone. 
Jones BBQ is so beloved by customers, that 
in February 2021, when the back half of the 
restaurant burned down in a fire, the commu-
nity rallied around Mr. Jones and raised over 
$100,000, allowing Jones BBQ to reopen by 
Memorial Day. 
In 2012, Jones BBQ became the first res-
taurant in Arkansas to receive a prestigious 
James Beard Foundation Award. In 2017, 
Jones BBQ was recognized as an Arkansas 
Food Hall of Fame Award Winner and in 2020 
was a People’s Choice Nominee. Then re-
cently, Jones BBQ found themselves on the 
New York Times favorite restaurant list for 
2021. 
Believed to be the first black-owned res-
taurant in the South, Jones BBQ is a staple of 
the First District of Arkansas. I encourage any-
one passing through to stop by and give 
Jones BBQ’s nationally acclaimed offerings a 
taste—they will not regret it. 
CELEBRATING 
10 
YEARS 
OF 
A 
SERENDIPITY CAKERY AND ICE 
CREAM SHOPPE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize A Serendipity Cakery and 
Ice Cream Shoppe in Riverview, Michigan, on 
the occasion of their 10th anniversary. Their 
decade spent as a staple of our community is 
worthy of commendation. 
A Serendipity Cakery was born in the kitch-
en of Tammie and Alan Bachran in 2012, 
where Tammie spent her days baking sweet 
treats for eager friends and family. As demand 
for her specialty baked goods grew, they 
opened a storefront in Wyandotte, Michigan in 
2015. A household name throughout the 
Downriver area, A Serendipity Cakery moved 
to their current, larger space in Riverview, 
Michigan in 2019. This new space allowed 
Tammie and Alan to expand their business, 
offering more treats than ever before and 
opening a space for guests to host birthday 
parties and other memorable celebrations. 
Among the desserts that A Serendipity 
Cakery offers are custom cakes, cake drops, 
cupcakes, and a variety of chocolate-dipped 
items. Their special cake drops are known to 
sell out quickly and customers can choose 
from over fifty flavors. Despite being a busy 
bakery with cakes coming in and out each 
day, A Serendipity Cakery still has time to give 
back. They have adopted families through 
their ‘‘Adopt a Family Fund’’ and frequently 
donate their baked goods to local auctions 
and fundraisers, including for those battling 
cancer and for The Lincoln Center in Wyan-
dotte, Michigan, that serves students with au-
tism spectrum disorder and cognitive and 
emotional impairments in local schools. Their 
work goes beyond just baking and providing 
delicious treats for our downriver families, in-
cluding my own—Tammie and her team help 
uplift their neighbors and spread awareness 
for various causes close to their hearts. For 
that we are a stronger community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 10th anniversary 
of A Serendipity Cakery and Ice Cream 
Shoppe in Riverview, Michigan. Please join 
me in congratulating them on a fantastic dec-
ade of business and in wishing them the best

Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of 
Charles Moss Duke, Jr. and celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of Apollo 16’s mission to the 
moon. 
Charlie was born in Charlotte, North Caro-
lina on October 3, 1935, to Charles and Willie 
Duke. Raised in Lancaster, South Carolina, he 
attended Lancaster High School and later 
transferred and graduated as valedictorian and

senior class president from the Admiral Far-
ragut Academy in Florida. He then attended 
the Naval Academy where he played golf and 
received a Bachelor of Science degree. 
Upon graduation in June 1957, Charlie was 
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 
United States Air Force. He served three 
years in Germany as a fighter interceptor pilot 
and logged over 4,000 hours of flying time. He 
also attended the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) where he received a Master 
of Science degree in aeronautics and astro-
nautics. 
In April 1966, Charlie became one of 19 as-
tronauts selected by the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA). He went on 
to serve five different Apollo missions to the 
moon. In addition to serving as a backup lunar 
module pilot for Apollo 13 and Apollo 17, 
Charlie served as the Capsule Communicator 
for Apollo 11, the first landing on the moon. 
He also served as the lunar module pilot on 
Apollo 16, which was the first scientific expedi-
tion to inspect, survey, and sample materials 
from in the Descartes region. During this mis-
sion, Charlie became the tenth and youngest 
person to walk on the moon. Charlie ultimately 
logged over 265 hours in space. He retired 
from NASA in December 1975 and went on to 
enter the United States Air Force Reserves. 
After thousands of hours training to go to 
the moon and finally setting foot on it, Charlie 
came back to earth with a new goal. With a 
renewed focus on his family and faith, Charlie 
became a committed Christian in April of 
1978. Shortly after, Charlie and his wife, Dotty, 
started the Duke Ministry for Christ. 
Charlie also became a successful business-
man. He owned a thriving Coors Beer distribu-
torship in Texas and later pursued real estate 
ventures. His subsequent business ventures 
include serving as the President of Orbit Cor-
porations, working as a consultant for Lock-
heed Martin, serving as chairman of the Astro-
naut Scholarship Foundation, and much more. 
Charlie has exhibited determination, cour-
age, and tenacity throughout his life. He has 
exceeded expectations in public service, high-
lighted by his receipt of numerous honors and 
accolades. For example, Charlie was named 
South Carolina Man of the Year and was in-
ducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame in 
1973. He has also received numerous hon-
orary degrees, including an Honorary Doctor 
of Philosophy from both the University of 
South Carolina and Clemson University. Char-
lie was also inducted into the U.S. Astronaut 
Hall of Fame in 1997. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize Charlie for his extraordinary career. Char-
lie is a living legend and has made our state 
and Nation proud. I thank Charlie for his ex-
ceptional service.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Payton Hildebrand of Findlay, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to the United States 
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo-

Payton’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Air Force Academy

tending one of our nation’s military academies 
not only offers the opportunity to serve our 
country, but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most 
challenging and rewarding experiences of their

Payton brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the in-
coming Class of 2026. While attending Findlay 
High School in Findlay, Ohio, Payton partici-
pated in Student Leadership Team, Junior 
Scholars, and was a member of Career and 
Tech National Honor Society. Throughout high 
school, Payton was involved with soccer as 
well as travel team soccer, earning his varsity 
letter through Findlay High School’s team. I 
am confident that Payton will carry the lessons 
of his student and athletic leadership to the Air 
Force Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Payton Hildebrand on his 
offer of appointment to the United States Air

HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following Proclama-
tions regarding Holocaust Remembrance Day: 
Joint Resolution Designating April 28 and 
29 of 1979 as ‘‘Days of Remembrance of Vic-
tims of the Holocaust’’. Whereas six million 
Jews and millions of other people were mur-
dered in concentration camps as part of a 
program of extermination carried out by the 
Nazi party during World War II; Whereas the 
people of the United States should recognize 
that all acts of bigotry are rooted in the cru-
elty of spirit and the callousness that led the 
Nazis to commit atrocities against millions 
of people, and should dedicate themselves to 
the principle of human equality; Whereas the 
people of the United States should recognize 
that tyranny creates the political atmos-
phere in which bigotry flourishes, and should 
be vigilant to detect, and ready to resist, the 
tyrannical exercise of power; Whereas on 
April 28 and 29 of 1945 the Armed Forces of 
the United States liberated the surviving 
victims of Nazi internment in the concentra-
tion camp in Dachau, Germany, and revealed 
to the world evidence of a tragic human hol-
ocaust that must never be forgotten; and 
Whereas the Nazi concentration camp in Da-
chau, Germany, is not only a shocking sym-
bol of Nazi brutality and destruction, but 
also a symbol of the danger inherent in tyr-
anny, the pernicious quality of bigotry, and 
the human capacity to be cruel: Now, there-
fore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House 
of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled. That April 
28 and 29 of 1979 are designated as ‘‘Days of 
Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust’’, 
and the President is authorized and re-
quested to issue a proclamation calling upon 
the people of the United States to observe 
such days with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. Approved September 18, 1978. 
PRESIDENT CARTER DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OF 
VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST STATEMENT ON 
SIGNING
H.J. RES. 1014 INTO
LAW—SEP-
TEMBER 18, 1978 
I have today signed House Joint Resolu-
tion 1014, designating April 28 and 29, 1979, as 
‘‘Days of Remembrance of Victims of the 
Holocaust.’’ 
The systematic extermination of millions 
of human beings by the Nazis during World 
War II was the most terrible crime in all re-
corded history. In the words of the resolu-
tion, the Holocaust remains ‘‘not only a 
shocking symbol of Nazi brutality and de-
struction, but also a symbol of the danger in-
herent in tyranny, the pernicious quality of 
bigotry, and the human capacity to be 
cruel.’’ 
The resolution was passed unanimously by 
both Houses of Congress. This reflects our 
Nation’s wholehearted conviction that the 
lessons of the Holocaust must never be for-
gotten. 
Senator John Danforth of Missouri, whom 
I commend for having originated the resolu-
tion, chose April 28 and 29, because it was on 
these dates, in 1945, that American troops 
liberated the Dachau concentration camp. 
The dates chosen by Senator Danforth and 
embodied in this resolution thus aptly sym-
bolize both the horror of genocide and the 
imperative to fight against it. 
During the next few months, the Presi-
dent’s Commission on the Holocaust will 
study ways in which this commemoration 
can best be observed, and I will issue an ap-
propriate proclamation next spring. In the 
meanwhile, I wish to commend Senator Dan-
forth, Representatives Wright, Rosenthal, 
Rhodes, and Vander Jagt and their col-
leagues, who joined in securing passage of 
H.J. Res. 1014.

many of them settled in Little Saigon in Or-
ange County. In the nearly 5 decades since 
then, Orange County has transformed be-
cause of the resilience and hope of the Viet-
namese community. I am proud to cosponsor 
a House Resolution in remembrance of the 
sacrifices of the brave Vietnamese people who 
were forced to flee their homeland and to 
commemorate the Fall of Saigon. 
As we begin AAPI Heritage Month, I am 
also proud to introduce a House Resolution 
recognizing the accomplishments and con-
tributions of over 2 million Vietnamese Ameri-
cans. The United States is home to the largest 
number of individuals of Vietnamese descent 
outside of Vietnam, and I join in representing 
the largest Vietnamese communities in the na-
tion in Orange County, California. 
Today, Vietnamese Americans contribute to 
American society through their work in busi-
ness, education, science and technology, en-
gineering, mathematics, literature and the arts, 
gastronomy, the armed forces, and public 
service at every level of government. 
Vietnamese Americans add to the rich cul-
tural and religious diversity of our nation. As a 
member of the Congressional Vietnam Cau-
cus, it is critical that we continue to represent 
and 
celebrate 
our 
Vietnamese 
families, 
friends, and neighbors, and recognize their 
significant contributions to American society. 
Today, we remember the sacrifices that Vi-
etnamese immigrants made, and we celebrate 
their contributions and achievements to our 
great Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
INFERTILITY AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate National Infertility 
Awareness Week to salute the parents, doc-
tors, researchers, and others for the extraor-
dinary progress made over the last four dec-
ades to help individuals have families who 
without this progress could not. National Infer-
tility Awareness Week, founded in 1989 by 
RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association 
is the largest public awareness campaign that 
addresses the public health issue of infertility. 
Most Americans are not aware that one in 
eight, or nearly 7.4 million Americans are im-
pacted by the disease of Infertility. The dis-
ease affects both men and women and it 
knows no barriers—it affects individuals of all 
races, religious backgrounds, and economic 
statuses. 
Since 1978, as a result of extraordinary 
medical advancements, millions of couples 
have been able to receive life-affirming treat-
ments to become pregnant. While for most of 
us having a child is taken for granted it is a 
painful and devastating struggle for millions of 
couples throughout the world. 
Research scientists have been making sig-
nificant advancement of Infertility treatments 
including a procedure that allows young can-
cer patients to preserve their fertility prior to 
undergoing lifesaving chemotherapy treat-
ments are incredible. Organizations like RE-
SOLVE, the Military Family Building Coalition, 
the National Infertility Association, and the Alli-
ance for Fertility Preservation advocate for the 
millions of individuals and couples in this 
country who need help to have a family. Ms. 
Barb Collura, the CEO of RESOLVE, has tes-
tified before Congress in support of fertility 
services for the countless military veterans 
whose service-related injuries have rendered 
them infertile. There are also others such as 
Joyce Reinecke, Executive Director of Alliance 
for Fertility Preservation and cancer survivor, 
who has lent her voice on the importance of 
affordable fertility preservation options for indi-
viduals undergoing cancer treatment. As a 
matter of fact, in the absence of coverage, 
charitable organizations providing valuable, 
life-changing, financial assistance the option of 
having children after surviving cancer might 
not otherwise be available. 
Congress can do more to remove many of 
the barriers that currently exist for those who 
experience infertility challenges but want to 
have a child. And I applaud my colleagues in-
cluding 
Congresswoman 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, Congresswoman BROWNLEY, Con-
gresswoman 
DELAURO, 
Congresswoman 
STRICKLAND, and Congressman RICK LARSEN 
for introducing legislation devoted to elimi-
nating obstacles to building families. I also sa-
lute the millions of infertility warriors through-
out the country and the world, who advocate 
on behalf of that most precious of gifts, that of 
family.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Gardners 
Candies, a staple of the Central Pennsylvania 
community, on celebrating one hundred and 
twenty-five years of operation. 
Founded in 1897 by James ‘‘Pike’’ Gardner 
in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, Gardners Candies 
began operations in a small store along with 
a wagon that allowed ‘‘Pike’’ to sell candy 
throughout the region. 
For over a century, Gardners has produced 
gourmet chocolate including their famous, 
‘‘Original Peanut Butter Meltaway.’’ 
In 2021, Benzel’s Pretzels and Gardners 
Candies entered into an agreement to bring 
together these iconic brands in the production 
of Gardners’ chocolate covered pretzels. 
I’m proud of the family sustaining jobs cre-
ated by the candy making companies in our 
community. From producing classic treats to 
creating quality jobs, Pennsylvania is known 
the world over for its candies and confec-
tioners, and I am proud to have some of the 
world’s finest right here in our community. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-

I

Gardners 
Candies on this milestone and wish them

U.S. more than $1.5 trillion per year, a signifi-
cant portion of which is paid for by the Medi-
care program. With an aging population, we 
can expect to see a continual rise of 
neurodegenerative diseases in the years to 
come. 
Brain research is key to understanding un-
derlying causes of these conditions. The sci-
entific community has made great strides in 
recent years, but continued investment is 
needed. Postmortem brain tissue is an irre-
placeable resource in neurological studies. 
However, communities of color and people ex-
periencing poverty are underrepresented in 
these studies. Overcoming these disparities is 
critical to producing research results that have 
an equitable impact. 
Brain donation is separate from the routine 
organ donation process. Educating the public 
on the distinctions can lead to increased dona-
tion that better reflects our communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan resolution.

SUPPORTING MOLDOVA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as the civilized world has been unin-
tentionally unified in opposition to Putin con-
ducting mass murder in Ukraine, Putin has un-
wittingly unified Republicans and Democrats in 
America. A clear example is Republican sup-
port of an op-ed from the Democrat Wash-
ington Post by Josh Rogin ‘‘West can’t afford 
to neglect Moldova, because Putin won’t’’ 
being the lead Opinion April 24th in The State 
paper of Columbia, South Carolina: 
WEST CAN’T AFFORD 
As the United States and Europe continue 
to scramble to help Ukraine defend its terri-
tory, preserve its democracy and save its 
economy, they should keep in mind that 
Ukraine is not the only country in the region 
suffering due to Russian President Vladimir 
Putin’s aggression. Next door, the small 
country of Moldova is appealing to the West 
for urgent help and long-term partnership. If 
we turn away from Moldova, again, we will 
push it into Putin’s arms. 
‘‘The 
Russian 
military 
aggression 
in 
Ukraine is making every single person in Eu-
rope feel less secure and is having a negative 
impact on every single person in Europe,’’ 
Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, 
told me in an interview last week in Wash-
ington. ‘‘And of course, this impact is more 
negative on Moldova, because Moldova is 
right there.’’ 
Popescu’ s official title is Minister of For-
eign Affairs and European Integration, which 
should tell us something. The new govern-
ment in Moldova, one of the region’s poorest 
countries, is trying to break a longrunning 
pattern of political dysfunction, systemic 
corruption and malign influence coming 
from Moscow. The December 2020 landslide 
election of Moldova’s first outright pro- 
Western president, the Harvard-educated 
former World Bank economist Maia Sandu, 
presents the best chance yet to move 
Moldova firmly into the Western camp. 
The Moldovan government has always 
tried to balance its relationships, for under-
standable reasons. Russia has 1,500 troops oc-
cupying the Moldovan breakaway territory 
of Transnistria and controls Moldova’s en-
ergy supply. There is still a large pro-Rus-
sian constituency in Moldovan politics, busi-
ness and society. 
But the invasion of Ukraine has changed 
everything in geopolitics, especially for 
Ukraine’s neighbors who now see that ‘‘neu-
trality’’ does not protect a small country 
from being viciously attacked on Putin’s 
whim. The Moldovan government has con-
demned the Russian invasion, even though 
Putin’s retaliation could prove disastrous. 
‘‘Moldova is a neutral state, but neutrality 
only refers to us not participating in mili-
tary action,’’ Popescu told me. ‘‘We’re not 
neutral when it comes to condemning the ag-
gression. We’re not neutral when it comes to 
defending the principles of international law, 
which must be respected.’’ 
The United States and European countries 
have been paying more attention to Moldova 
recently. Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
visited the capital, Chisinau, last month. 
The United States has given Moldova $130 
million since the Ukraine war started to help 
with the hundreds of thousands of new refu-
gees spilling over the border. 
But that’s just a Band-Aid for Moldova’s 
problems. 
‘‘We need to ensure socioeconomic sta-
bility. We are severely impacted by the war. 
We are Ukraine’s most fragile neighbor,’’ 
Popescu said. ‘‘We’ve been coping reasonably 
well with the humanitarian crisis, the ref-
ugee situation and the energy crisis. We’ve 
been pursuing reforms. But, it’s a difficult 
region.’’ 
The question is whether the West’s recent 
increased attention to Moldova will persist 
beyond the current crisis. Popescu’s visit 
was framed as a new ‘‘strategic dialogue’’ 
with the United States, but a similar effort 
during the Obama administration withered 
away. 
There are several specific things the 
United States could do to cement its com-
mitment to Moldova’s long-term stability 
and success. The Justice Department could 
do more to go after Moldova’s sanctioned 
oligarchs and their wealth, especially the 
ones living in the United States. U.S. organi-
zations should double down on helping 
Moldova continue its reforms and root out 
corruption. And the United States can help 
Moldova diversify its energy supply, diluting 
Putin’s leverage. 
And while Moldova isn’t seeking military 
assistance, it has a huge and growing need 
for help fortifying and managing its borders, 
including the 863 miles it shares with 
Ukraine. That’s perhaps the most urgent ef-
fort, because if Ukraine falls, Moldova could 
easily be Russia’s next target. Would Putin 
actually invade Moldova and try to topple 
the prowestern government, as he is at-
tempting to do next door? 
‘‘We don’t know,’’ Popescu told me. ‘‘Our 
task is to be ready for everything.’’ 
In conclusion, I am grateful for the com-
mitted service of Mr. Eugen Caras, Ambas-
sador of the Republic of Moldova to the United 
States of America and United Mexican States. 
We stand together to deter war criminal 
Putin with the courageous people of Ukraine 
led by President Zelenskyy who has adopted 
the spirit of the American Revolution ‘‘Don’t 
tread on me’’, ‘‘Live Free or Die.’’ 
The unity of freedom-loving countries was 
reinforced by President Salome Zourabichvili 
of Georgia who I am grateful to meet with 
today. He has courageously cited that the 
people of Georgia are 100 percent united in 
‘‘solidarity with Ukraine.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF COL. 
DONALD ‘‘DON’’ P. MORSE, D.D.S. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my good friend, Col. Donald 
‘‘Don’’ P. Morse, D.D.S. Don passed away on 
March 24, 2022, at the age of 87. I served 
under 
his 
command 
while 
stationed 
at 
Ramstein Air Force Base (AFB) in Germany 
many years ago. Don influenced my life, and 
the lives of every other officer entrusted under 
his command, with his unwavering patriotism 
and steadfast leadership. 
He was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on 
Christmas Day in 1934. Don graduated from 
Ray High School and went to Del Mar College 
before attending the University of Texas Den-
tal School in Houston. After graduating from 
dental school in 1959, he commissioned into 
the Air Force as a dental officer. Don served 
for 26 years and had many different duty sta-
tions, both overseas and state-side. During his 
last 13 years, he was the Base Dental Com-
mander 
at 
various 
military 
installations 
throughout the U.S. and overseas, including 
Ramstein AFB. Don received numerous deco-
rations for his military service. Among them, 
were the Chief Dental Badge and Legion of 
Merit. 
After retiring from the Air Force, Don was 
asked to serve as the Dental Health Coordi-
nator for the San Antonio Metropolitan Health 
District. He later became the Public Health Ad-
ministrator for the district, overseeing not only 
Dental Health services but also the Health De-
partment Communicable Disease programs, 
Animal 
Care 
services, 
and 
Occupational 
Health and Wellness services. Don was instru-
mental in adding fluoride to the city of San An-
tonio’s water, was the Medical Logistics Offi-
cer for Pope St. John Paul II’s visit to San An-
tonio in 1987, and worked with various pro-
grams such as Head Start. Throughout both 
his military and public health careers, Don sat 
on countless committees, authored several 
published works, and received many honors. 
He took great pride in his country and com-
munity, serving on the board of the Beethoven 
Ma¨ennerchor, one of Texas’s oldest German 
singing societies, for 13 years. Don enjoyed 
singing, volunteering, and supporting German 
culture, language, and Gemu¨tlichkeit. He was 
also passionate about riding motorcycles, a 
pastime that allowed him to take in the beauty 
of our nation firsthand. However, time spent 
with family and friends was Don’s ultimate joy. 
He loved telling stories with poetic skill and 
humor, often times in German. Don never met 
a stranger, and his love for traveling and 
sense of adventure took him all over the 
world. He is survived by his wife, Iris Morse; 
son, Eric Morse; daughter, Lia Conners, and 
husband, 
Skip; 
granddaughters, 
Isabella 
Morse, Arianna Morse, Zoe Connors, and 
Quinn Connors; stepdaughters, Jill Rittimann, 
Julie Ellis and husband, Jeremy, and Karen 
Kricka and husband, Simon; step-grand-
children, Geoffrey Rittimann and wife, Katie, 
Aidan Ellis, Arianna Ellis, Jackson Kricka, 
Corbin Kricka, and Chloe Kricka. Don is pre-
ceded in death by the mother of his children, 
Suse Morse. He considered all of his family a 
precious blessing to him. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to cele-
brate the life of this remarkable American, an 
outstanding mentor who taught me what it 
means to be a patriot. Don was a fine military 
officer and served his country and community 
with distinction. May God continue to bless his 
family and loved ones, and my heartfelt pray-
ers remain with them during this difficult time.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
RORY SMITH ON HIS OFFER OF 
APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE 
UNITED STATES NAVAL ACAD-
EMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Rory Smith of Maumee, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. 
Rory’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Naval Academy this 
fall with the incoming Class of 2026. Attending 
one of our nation’s military academies not only 
offers the opportunity to serve our country, but 
also guarantees a world-class education while 
undertaking one of the most challenging and 
rewarding experiences of their lives. 
Rory brings a tremendous amount of leader-
ship, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Anthony 
Wayne High School in Whitehouse, Ohio, 
Rory participated in student government, 
Waterville Historical Society, and was presi-
dent of the National Honor Society. Through-
out high school, Rory was involved with cross 
country, swimming, and baseball, earning var-
sity letters in all three. I am confident that 
Rory will carry the lessons of his student and 
athletic leadership to the Naval Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Rory Smith on his offer of 
appointment to the United States Naval Acad-
emy. Our service academies offer the finest 
military training and education available. I am 
positive that Rory will excel during his career 
at the Naval Academy, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in extending their best 
wishes to him as he begins his service to our 
Nation. 
HONORING THE CENTENNIAL AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE WILLIAM G. 
MATHER SCHOOL 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the William G. Mather 
School for their 100th anniversary celebration 
on May 4, 2022. Through their longtime devo-
tion to their students and community, William 
G. Mather School has inspired countless stu-
dents and become an indispensable part of 
the state of Michigan. 
Named after the industrialist and Upper Pe-
ninsula iron magnate, the William G. Mather 
School first opened in 1922. Originally a high 
school teaching grades 9 through 12, Mather 
was built as a state-of-the-art facility. Its gym-
nasium, known as The Pit, is famous through-
out the Upper Peninsula for hosting many 
sporting and social events over the last cen-
tury, and seats hundreds of local spectators 
and students. During this historic centennial 
celebration, we honor the generations of dedi-
cated faculty of William G. Mather and their 
devotion to educating our local youth. Today, 
Mather Elementary School continues that leg-
acy of excellence, giving students in the U.P. 
the best possible opportunity to learn and suc-
ceed. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
the William G. Mather School for their tireless 
work educating our youth and their drive to 
bring positive change to their community. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such dedicated 
citizens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
them all the best in their future endeavors.

HONORING 
NATIONAL 
INFER-
TILITY AWARENESS WEEK AND 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
MILITARY 
FAMILY BUILDING COALITION 
HON. DAN CRENSHAW 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, this 
week, we celebrate and bring recognition to 
National Infertility Awareness week. April is 
also the month of the military child. 
Parenthood is one of the most rewarding 
chapters in life, and our armed service mem-
bers experiencing the challenges of infertility 
should have access to quality care, treatment, 
and resources. One organization working to 
make that happen is the Military Family Build-
ing Coalition (MFBC), a non-profit military sup-
port organization started by two SEAL wives, 
Ellen Gustafson and Katy Bell Hendrickson. 
One of MFBC’s initiatives, ‘‘The Tadpole 
Project’’, allows the NSW community to 
cryogenically freeze their sperm so conception 
can occur whenever the service member and 
spouse is ready to build their family, even if 
the service member is deployed. 
For our military families, the time to have a 
child should not be dictated by the enemy or 
deployment cycle. I commend Ellen and Katy 
on their critical work. They show the grit and 
determination of SEAL spouses, who just like

RECOGNIZING THE ELEVENTH AN-
NUAL 
COCOA 
BEACH 
‘‘FOOT-
PRINTS IN THE SAND’’ KIDNEY 
WALK AND THOSE WHO HAVE 
GIVEN THE PRECIOUS GIFT OF 
LIFE 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on Saturday, 
May 7, 2022, thousands of residents from 
across Central Florida will gather at the Cocoa 
Beach Pier in Cocoa Beach, Florida, to take 
part in the Eleventh Annual ‘‘Footprints in the 
Sand’’ Cocoa Beach Kidney Walk. Katie and I 
have joined others in our community in partici-
pating every year since the first walk was or-
ganized in 2012 by Rich Salick, Bill Hahn and 
volunteers with the Florida Affiliate of the Na-
tional Kidney Foundation. 
The ‘‘Footprints in the Sand’’ Kidney Walk 
brings our community together to show our 
love and concern. So many of us have family, 
friends and loved ones that are afflicted by 
kidney disease, and they need our strength 
and support. The road ahead is not easy for 
them, but as the kidney walk demonstrates, 
they do not have to travel that path alone. 
The National Kidney Foundation of Florida, 
its supporters and activists have made a sig-
nificant difference in people’s lives. They not 
only raise awareness about this disease, but 
they have helped push for much needed 
changes in our laws and new innovations to 
give patients more treatment options and a 
better quality of life. This year organizers of 
the kidney walk will recognize organ donors 
and their families for giving the precious gift of 
life so that others could receive a second 
chance and continue with their lives. 
Those recognized include: 
Dawn Futch honoring Micheal Futch, Vivien 
Pogeler 
honoring 
Scott 
Pogeler, 
Jasmin 
Persaud honoring Anand Persaud, Jennifer 
Eden honoring Blake Eden, Mandee Seitz 
honoring Aryia Grace, Teresa Ervin honoring

Kathleen 
Deleonardo

Anthony

Leslie Collins honoring Jose Collins, and 
Nancy Velazquez honoring Pedro Batista. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing the 
strong will of these caring families, their loved 
ones and all those who have joined the effort 
and worked tirelessly to raise awareness 
about kidney disease. 
BLUESTAR RECYCLERS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize BlueStar Recyclers for win-
ning the Golden Rotary’s 2022 Ethics in Busi-
ness Award. 
Each year, the Golden Rotary Club awards 
one for-profit company and one non-profit or-
ganization for their outstanding ethical behav-
ior and leadership. The community is asked to 
nominate organizations whom they think dis-
play the highest standards of ethical business 
practices, integrity, and civic and social re-
sponsibility. Winners are then chosen by stu-
dents in an Ethics class at the Colorado 
School of Mines. 
A non-profit organization, BlueStar works to 
recycle electronics and other materials and in 
turn create local jobs for people with autism 
and other disabilities. Their mission has en-
abled them to be successful while making a 
huge impact on our community. There are 
countless examples of BlueStar’s positive im-
pact in our community and high ethical and 
moral standards. The company boasts some 
of the lowest turnover, absenteeism, and lost- 
time accident rates in the industry. Testi-
monies from employees show a positive work-
place environment and personal growth oppor-
tunities for all employees. 
BlueStar has proven to be a highly success-
ful organization which helps people with dis-
abilities, provides an excellent return on in-
vestment for its customers while be environ-
mentally-conscious and giving back to their 
community. Congratulations to BlueStar Recy-
clers on receiving this award from the Golden 
Rotary Club and I thank them for their ethical 
leadership and ongoing contributions to our 
community.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
INFERTILITY AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 28, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Na-
tional Infertility Awareness Week to salute the 
parents, doctors, researchers, and many oth-
ers for the extraordinary advancements made 
over the last four decades to help individuals 
build families who, without this progress, could 
not do so. National Infertility Awareness Week, 
founded in 1989 by RESOLVE: The National 
Infertility Association, is the largest public 
awareness campaign that addresses the pub-
lic health issue of infertility. 
Most Americans are not aware that one in 
eight, or nearly 7.4 million Americans are hin-
dered by the disease of infertility. It affects 
both men and women and knows no barriers. 
Infertility affects all races, religious back-
grounds, and every economic status. I intro-
duce this bipartisan resolution to highlight this 
issue, encourage research, and support all 
those affected by infertility. 
Since 1978, extraordinary medical advance-
ments have enabled millions of couples to re-
ceive life-affirming treatments that resulted in 
the delivery of babies. We must continue this 
progress and especially work to reduce racial 
and ethnic disparities in research and treat-
ment. Bringing a child into the world is truly a 
blessing and should be available for anyone 
who wants to start a family, no matter their 
background. 
The contributions that research scientists 
have made to advance infertility treatments— 
including a procedure that allows young can-
cer patients to preserve their fertility prior to 
undergoing lifesaving chemotherapy treat-
ments—are utterly amazing. Organizations like 
RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, 
and the Alliance for Fertility Preservation, all 
advocate for the millions of individuals and 
couples in this country who need help to have 
a family. 
I know from my own infertility experience, 
that to realize the dream of having children, 
we must better understand infertility and how 
it affects individuals and families to advocate 
for sensible solutions, more effectively. 
Ms. Barb Collura, the CEO of RESOLVE, 
has testified before Congress in support of fer-
tility services for the countless military vet-
erans whose service-related injuries have ren-
dered them infertile. There are also others 
such as Joyce Reinecke, Executive Director of 
the Alliance for Fertility Preservation and can-
cer survivor, has lent her voice to the impor-
tance of affordable fertility preservation options 
for individuals undergoing cancer treatment. In 
fact, in the absence of adequate coverage, 
charitable organizations provide valuable, life- 
changing, financial assistance to cancer sur-
vivors who would like to have children but lack 
support. 
Congress can do more to remove barriers 
that currently exist for those who experience 
infertility challenges. And I applaud my col-
leagues, 
including 
Congresswomen 
JULIA 
BROWNLEY, ROSA DELAURO, MARILYN STRICK-
LAND, and Congressman RICK LARSEN for join-
ing me in introducing legislation devoted to 
eliminating obstacles to building families. 
I also salute the millions of infertility warriors 
throughout the country and the world, who ad-
vocate on behalf of that most precious of gifts, 
that of creating a family.
