The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, vindicate those who 
cling to the truth. They seek to walk 
on Your path, to honor You with their 
work, and to glorify You with their 
lives. May these lawmakers remember 
that You are their light and salvation,

Lord, You refuse to withhold any 
good thing from those who walk blame-
less before You. Continue to strengthen 
our Senators, who strive to please You

tions. Empower them as they seek and 
pursue peace for our Nation and world. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
like all of my colleagues, I spent last 
week traveling my home State. I spoke 
with Kentuckians about where we have 
come over the past 15 months, where 
we are today, and the bright future we 
should have ahead. 
More than 1.8 million Kentuckians 
have received COVID vaccines. These 
medical 
miracles 
were 
created 
in 
record time by genius scientists plus 
Operation Warp Speed. And they are 
proving the pathway back to normalcy 
that we had hoped for. 
I was happy to get to visit the Bap-
tist Health Hardin Memorial Hospital 
in Elizabethtown to hear about their 
vaccination program and to thank the 
staff for all of their work. 
We should be on track for a fantastic 
American 
comeback 
summer, 
full 
steam ahead. From vaccinations to job 
growth, the new Biden administration 
inherited favorable trends in every di-
rection, thanks to the five bipartisan 
rescue packages that Congress passed 
just last year. 
But in several important ways, the 
decisions of elected Democrats have 
contributed to slowing the return to 
normalcy. We have seen some State 
and local officials bow to Big Labor 
and soft-pedal the clear science on 
school reopenings. And the big bill that 
Washington Democrats pushed through 
a couple of months ago did not require 
schools to reopen in order to receive 
even more extra funding. 
The President and his team keep 
sending mixed messages about gath-
erings and wearing masks that some-
times break from their own CDC’s 
guidance for vaccinated Americans. 
Again, there almost seems to be some 
reluctance to let go of emergency 
measures, even to the point of clashing 
with science. 
And what about our economic recov-
ery? 
Back 
in 
March, 
Democrats 
rammed through their so-called Amer-
ican Rescue Plan with a $2 trillion par-
tisan spending spree. It is packed with 
policies that seem designed for March 
2020, not March 2021; for example: con-
tinuing to use taxpayer dollars to pay 
a special bonus for unemployed people 
to stay home rather than filling one of 
the growing number of job openings 
around the country. 
Republicans had this crazy idea that 
with vaccines flooding the country, 
with COVID–19 in retreat, it was time

S2398 
May 10, 2021 
to actually reopen our country instead 
of spending even more of working fami-
lies’ tax dollars to keep things shut 
down. 
Well, a few days ago, experts were 
stunned by a monthly jobs report for 
April that came in way below expecta-
tions. It was the first full month of 
data collected after the Democrats 
passed their so-called rescue plan. This 
bill they sold as a fast-acting, urgent, 
emergency measure that was going to 
bolster our economy right away. This 
report was expected to show that more 
than a million American workers had 
gotten jobs back in the month of April. 
Instead, we added about one-fourth 
that many jobs. 
Now, I had just spent the prior week 
talking with Kentuckians. I spoke with 
workers and employers at nearly every 
size of business from just about every 
kind of industry, all across the spec-
trum. And from big national companies 
to local chambers of commerce, to 
businesses like Manchester Tank in 
Campbellsville, we heard optimism but 
also real concerns—concerns about in-
flation and runaway costs, concerns 
about backed-up supply chains. 
And as Washington pays workers a 
bonus to stay unemployed, virtually 
everyone discussed very real concerns 
about their difficulties in finding work-
ers who are willing to come back and 
fill these open positions. Almost every 
employer I spoke with specifically 
mentioned the extra generous jobless 
benefits as a key force holding back 
our recovery. 
Now, I have heard some Democrats 
say that whatever incentives Wash-
ington creates, the responsibility real-
ly falls on workers. But my friends on 
the other side can’t use the American 
people to shield their own bad ideas 
from scrutiny. Policy matters. Incen-
tives matter. 
It is May of 2021. Vaccines are avail-
able nationwide. There are millions of 
jobs open, ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs from 
coast to coast. We should not still be 
taxing the Americans who are working 
to fund continued extra benefits for 
those staying home. 
It is not March of 2020 anymore. It is 
May of 2021. Kentuckians and all Amer-
icans need our Democratic friends to 
govern accordingly. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, yesterday marked 
the beginning of National Police Week. 
Under normal circumstance, we would 
be welcoming police officers across the 
country here to Washington to share 
experiences and commemorate broth-
ers and sisters who have fallen in the 
line of duty. 
This year, I understand many of the 
in-person gatherings have been post-
poned until this autumn. But we are 
still remembering our law enforcement 
officers as we prepare for Police Offi-
cers Memorial Day on May 15. 
The past year has seen the difficult 
job of law enforcement become even 
harder. They have battled the chal-
lenges of the historic pandemic. In 
many places, they have grappled with 
increased violent crime rates and un-
rest. And following terrible incidents 
this past year, the majority of brave 
and honorable law enforcement officers 
have too often found themselves paint-
ed unfairly with a broad brush, as 
though their entire profession should 
be defined by the worst examples. 
This year’s remembrances will be es-
pecially somber here at the Capitol, 
where we are still mourning Officers 
Billy Evans, Howie Liebengood, and 
Brian Sicknick, whom we have lost in 
a matter of months. 
I hope police officers throughout our 
country, from the Capitol to Kentucky 
and all 50 States, know how very grate-
ful we are for their courage and for 
their service. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the last time we observed Mother’s 
Day, most of the country could not 
spend time with their parents or have 
their kids spend time with them. 
Standing outside of a window and wav-
ing to mom was the closest you could 
get. I remember that. So this year, I 
was beyond grateful to celebrate with 
my mother and my daughters in per-
son. I know the same was true for 
Americans across the country. As 
COVID–19 continues to recede—and 
more than half of eligible adults have 
received at least one shot of the vac-
cine after a very painful and difficult 
year—it was another sign that our 
country is turning the corner. Praise 
God. 
Now, as we begin this work period, 
the Senate will continue working to 
help the country recover and build 
back stronger than ever. That includes 
filling 
vacancies 
in 
the 
executive 
branch with highly qualified public 
servants. 
This week, the Senate will consider 
the nomination of Andrea Palm for 
Deputy HHS Secretary and Cynthia 
Marten, a teacher of 17 years, to serve 
as the next Deputy Education Sec-
retary. There will be additional nomi-
nations on the floor as the week goes 
on. At the committee level, at least 
half a dozen other nominees will have 
their markups. 
There will be plenty of legislative ac-
tion off the floor as well. Discussions 
continue on a potential, bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, gun safety legisla-
tion, and policing reform. 
On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce 
Committee will begin to mark up the 
Endless Frontier Act, bipartisan legis-
lation that would invest in our sci-
entific and technologic capabilities and 
help the United States outcompete 
China and other nations in a number of 
emerging industries. There have been 
extremely 
constructive 
bipartisan 
talks over the last week, and I am fully 
supportive of the product that will be 
considered in Wednesday’s committee 
meeting. 
In addition, a number of other Senate 
committees are working on bipartisan 
legislation to improve our competitive-
ness and make the United States a 
world leader in advanced manufac-
turing, innovation, and supply chains. 
It is my intention to have the full 
Senate consider comprehensive com-
petitive legislation during this work 
period. 
This week, the Senate Rules Com-
mittee will also mark up S. 1, a bill to 
strengthen our democracy, increase 
transparency in our campaign finance 
system, and make it easier for all 
Americans to vote. The Senate Demo-
cratic majority named this bill ‘‘S. 1’’ 
because it is a very top priority. The 
majority gets to name the first five 
bills of any new Congress. We picked 
the For the People Act to be S. 1 for a 
reason. Make no mistake, we are mov-
ing forward with S. 1 in the Rules Com-
mittee this week. I will attend the 
markup tomorrow. 
As a reminder to my colleagues, I 
have committed to bring S. 1 to the 
floor of the Senate. As the Rules Com-
mittee prepares to amend and advance 
S. 1, our Republican colleagues face a 
critical choice between working with 
Democrats in good faith to pass law to 
protect our democracy or siding with 
Republican State legislatures that are 
orchestrating the largest contraction 
of voting rights in decades. There is no 
reason our two parties can’t work to-
gether on S. 1. In fact, the legislation 
has already been updated and im-
proved. It now includes input from 
election officials across the country, 
including Republican election officials. 
I am sure we will see additional 
amendments to mark up tomorrow. 
For example, I understand my col-
league from Georgia, Senator OSSOFF, 
will offer an amendment to ban States 
from restricting volunteers from giving 
food and water to Americans waiting in 
line to vote. You would think such a 
provision would be unnecessary, but, 
sadly, giving voters food or water while 
they are waiting in long lines has just 
been criminalized by the State of Geor-
gia. 
Look, we know our Republican col-
leagues don’t like every aspect of S. 1, 
but will they work in good faith to im-
prove it? Will they offer revisions or 
new ideas to protect voting rights, or,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2399 
May 10, 2021 
through uncompromising resistance to 
commonsense voter protections, will 
they side with Republican legislatures 
across the country that are restricting 
the voting rights in a way that hurts 
African 
Americans, 
Latinos, 
and 
younger and poorer Americans? The 
choice is theirs. 
Two final points on this. No. 1, Don-
ald Trump spread the ‘‘big lie.’’ We all 
know it was a big lie that there was 
massive fraud in the elections. Instead 
of resisting that lie—so harmful to our 
democracy because when people don’t 
have faith in the electoral process, it 
withers faith in our very democracy— 
so many Republicans in State legisla-
tures and here in the Senate, unfortu-
nately, are spreading that lie. 
Second, what has been the tradition 
of America? It has been to improve the 
right to vote. At the time of the Con-
stitution, in many States, you had to 
be a White male Protestant property 
owner to vote. We have improved on 
that. We have improved on that begin-
ning in many different ways through 
the years. What the Republican legisla-
tures are taking is a giant setback—a 
giant step back in the progress we have 
made to making this a more perfect 
union. 
Will the Republican Senate, in the 
Rules Committee tomorrow and later 
on the floor of the Senate when they 
bring the bill forward, participate in 
improving on democracy or in helping, 
aiding, and abetting the big lie and the 
giant step backward? 
Finally, on State and local aid, today 
the Treasury Department launched a 
$350 billion program to deliver aid to 
State and local governments—funding 
that Democrats in Congress provided 
through the American Rescue Plan. 
After fighting this pandemic on the 
frontlines, State and local govern-
ments in New York and across the 
country needed help, and they needed 
it quickly to keep frontline workers on 
the job and prevent brutal service cuts. 
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan 
and the Treasury Department’s an-
nouncement this morning, we can fi-
nally say that help is on the way to 
State and local governments. 
Eligible State, territorial, city, coun-
ty, and Tribal governments will be able 
to access funding directly from the 
Treasury Department in the coming 
days. State and local governments now 
need to file applications with Treasury. 
Once they are processed, money will 
begin flowing. Let me say that again. 
State, local, and Tribal governments 
should prepare to file applications with 
the Treasury Department for assist-
ance, and I am told the assistance will 
be quickly forthcoming. 
And, State and local government, it 
is not only available, it is flexible. The 
Biden administration deserves credit 
for providing clear guidance in broad 
categories for spending the money, let-
ting States make their own decisions 
about how to allocate funds to recover 
from the pandemic and address imme-
diate needs. Whether it is to support 
public health systems, small busi-
nesses, necessary infrastructure, hard- 
hit industries like tourism, or premium 
pay for essential workers, States can 
use the funding we passed in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan to help their con-
stituents and their economy recover in 
a variety of ways. 
The 
Treasury 
Department’s 
an-
nouncement today begins the process 
of delivering the resources our States 
and municipalities need to prevent lay-
offs, keep essential services running, 
and boost Main Street businesses from 
one end of the country to the other. 
I was proud to successfully push for 
robust State and local funding in the 
American Rescue Plan, and I will con-
tinue to work with the Biden adminis-
tration as this funding is distributed. 
I yield the floor. 
No, I don’t yield the floor. I finished 
my speech, but I have another activity 
or two to do.

APRIL JOBS REPORT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
some economists have another name 
for the recession that we are living 
through, the one that was caused by 
the COVID pandemic. They call it a 
‘‘she-cession’’ because the economic 
hardships and job losses have fallen 
disproportionately on women, espe-
cially on working mothers. It is ironic 
that we are having this conversation 
the day after Mother’s Day and reflect-
ing on the current state of American 
families in the midst of a pandemic 
but, equally important, on the state of 
American families and the state of the 
mothers of those families and the eco-
nomic realities that they face. 
There 
are 
2.5 
million 
American 
women who have dropped out or were 
pushed out of the workforce since the 
start of this pandemic. In a recent ABC 
News poll, 25 percent of women said 
they are worse off economically now 
than they were a year ago compared to 
18 percent of men. A survey last fall 
found that almost 40 percent of work-
ing mothers in my State of Illinois—40 
percent—lost their jobs or are working 
reduced hours. Nearly half of all work-
ing mothers of color reported the same. 
There are many reasons that this re-
cession has been so economically dev-
astating for so many women, but the 
two biggest reasons are these: Women 
are overrepresented in the industries 
that have been hit the hardest by the 
pandemic: restaurants, retail, leisure 
and hospitality. Women are also the 
primary caregivers—in some cases, the 
only caregivers—in the vast majority 
of American families. With schools and 
childcare programs closed, what choice 
does a working mother have besides 
stepping back from work? 
For millions of American mothers 
and their families, the stimulus pay-
ments, the enhanced unemployment 
checks, the increased child tax credits, 
and other economic benefits in the 
American Rescue Plan have literally 
been a lifeline. They have enabled 
these mothers and families to feed 
their kids and to keep their homes dur-
ing the worst recession since the Great 
Depression. 
So it has come as a bit of a surprise 
that our Republican colleagues would 
choose to start Mother’s Day weekend 
by vowing to end enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits for more than 8 million 
American workers. They cite the April 
jobs report as their justification. After 
we added 770,000 jobs in March—a 
strong showing—we learned last week 
the U.S. economy added only 266,000 
jobs in April. Immediately, our Repub-
lican 
colleagues 
cited 
the 
dis-
appointing jobs numbers as proof that 
the recovery has clearly stalled and 
that we have to do more to get people 
back to work, as if it justifies ending 
enhanced jobless benefits. 
They seem to think that additional 
unemployment benefits make Amer-
ican workers lazy. They imply that 
Americans would rather sit at home, 
watch nonstop Netflix, and eat choco-
late-covered cherries rather than go 
back to work. They must not know 
many American workers. Americans 
want to work. Americans work longer 
and harder than their counterparts in 
almost every nation in the world. We 
should be proud of that work ethic and 
what it has meant to America. 
The reason many workers haven’t re-
turned to the workplace isn’t because 
they are lazy. People remain afraid of 
this coronavirus. They lack adequate, 
affordable childcare. They may be car-
ing for older family members or be 
dealing with personal health condi-
tions. That is the reality of life in fam-
ilies and, particularly, in struggling, 
working families. Taking away the en-
hanced unemployment benefits they 
need to be able to feed their kids and

pay their rents or mortgages does 
nothing to change that reality except 
to make it worse. 
Our Republican colleagues will say 
that the April jobs report is the reason 
for their renewed determination to 
stop sending these enhanced checks to 
the jobless families. The truth is—the 
real truth is—these Republicans think 
the Federal Government ought to do 
the bare minimum to help working 
families weather this pandemic. That 
is their credo: Government isn’t the so-
lution; government is the problem even 
during a once-in-a-century health cri-
sis. Whether the economy is adding 
jobs quickly or slowly, whether the 
COVID infection and death rates are 
rising or falling, the Republicans have 
fought to scale back Federal unem-
ployment benefits for workers. 
Not one of our Republican col-
leagues—let me repeat that—not one of 
our 
Republican 
Senate 
colleagues 
voted for the American Rescue Plan. 
Remember that one? That was the plan 
by President Biden that put more 
money into the purchase of vaccines; 
that finally set up a nationwide effort 
to administer those vaccines; that sent 
the $1,400 cash check to working fami-
lies—a check that had been promised 
by the previous administration—that 
gave an additional helping hand to 
small businesses to get through the 
pandemic; and that did, in fact, in-
crease or, I should say, lengthen the 
period of time that people would be eli-
gible for unemployment benefits. 
That is a pretty good, important 
package; don’t you think? When you 
look at what it did for America, it 
came just in the nick of time for many. 
You would have thought, wouldn’t you, 
with 50 Republican Senators, that 
one—one—Republican Senator would 
have supported those things. Unfortu-
nately, that wasn’t the case. 
There are things we can do to get 
this economy moving again. We need to 
encourage more Americans to get vac-
cinated, No. 1. President Biden has 
done a remarkable job, but we still 
have work to do. We shouldn’t sit back 
and relax. Every person vaccinated is 
another person protected. Also, the 
people around them are protected. The 
fundamental fact remains, as we talk 
about all of the economics and all of 
the government philosophy, our econ-
omy cannot recover completely until 
this virus is under control. 
In addition, if the Republicans want 
to solve the problems facing our work-
force, there are pretty obvious answers: 
Sit down, and talk to a working moth-
er who lost a job, who has a child at 
home, perhaps a young child, and ask 
her: Well, how soon can you get back 
to work? 
Her question back to you: Senator, 
how soon can you take care of my lit-
tle boy? How much is it going to cost 
me? 
That is the reality. The daycare cen-
ter is probably closed, and the baby-
sitter may not be available. There are 
lots of reasons. It just may be too ex-
pensive. That is the reality of work for 
American workers today. That mother 
isn’t lazy. That mother faces a chal-
lenge that not one of us wants to see in 
our families. Either our children or 
grandchildren, we don’t want them to 
be pawns in this whole public debate 
about when we are going to start or 
stop helping families. 
We need to face this workforce prob-
lem because it is really key to it, this 
childcare crisis in this country. Do we 
care enough about families and chil-
dren to make sure there is affordable 
daycare? President Biden does. He is 
talking about a program nationwide, 
thank goodness, which will finally ad-
dress this issue and put a goal in place 
to keep the cost of daycare manageable 
for every family regardless of its 
means. 
So what did the Republican Senate 
leader say last week? He said he was 
100-percent 
focused—100-percent 
fo-
cused—on stopping the Biden adminis-
tration. That is an echo of what he said 
in the first, early days of the Obama 
Presidency. He came to the floor, and 
instead of talking about what we could 
do to work together to try to find some 
bipartisan ground, he said that he 
hoped to do everything he could to 
make sure that Barack Obama was a 
one-term President. It didn’t take him 
long to come back with a similar state-
ment with regard to the Biden Presi-
dency. 
It is not encouraging, but I am en-
couraged by the fact that there are 
some Republicans who just don’t agree 
with it. I hope that they will step up. I 
hope that they will show that we can 
still work on a bipartisan basis. This 
‘‘100-percent’’ stopping the Biden ad-
ministration from Senator MCCONNELL 
cannot be the basis for a successful 
congressional session. 
The Senate Democrats have an agen-
da; it is true. We are 100-percent fo-
cused on getting this pandemic under 
control and building a better future for 
our families. We would like to work 
with our Republican colleagues to do 
it. Although they didn’t join us, for ex-
ample, on the child tax credit, I do be-
lieve that they really care about the 
children in America, particularly the 
poor children in America, and care 
enough to want to help them with 
daycare, with early kindergarten class-
es, with extending the school year be-
yond the 12th grade for skills that are 
needed. 
The Presiding Officer knows this well 
because we come from the same State. 
Last week, I had an exciting visit in 
Normal, IL. Things are not normal in 
Normal, IL. They are exceedingly be-
yond normal. I visited the Rivian 
plant. The Rivian plant has an incred-
ible story. 
It used to be the Mitsubishi auto 
plant. Six years ago, it closed. One 
thousand workers were on the payroll 
at the time they lost their jobs, good- 
paying jobs. And there sat that empty 
factory out on the cornfields just west 
of Bloomington-Normal. 
The mayor of the town, Chris Koos, 
called me a year after the Mitsubishi 
plant had closed and said: ‘‘Senator, I 
think I’ve got a buyer.’’ I said: ‘‘Chris, 
what are you drinking?’’ ‘‘No,’’ he says, 
‘‘I really believe there’s a new company 
that makes electric vehicles that’s 
really interested in the Mitsubishi 
plant.’’ 
Well, he was right, and thank good-
ness he was. Fast forward 4 years later, 
and a visit last week, he showed this 
amazing facility, which is now going to 
be expanded because of the plant that 
is going to build electric vehicles. They 
already have models on the floor that 
you can see of SUVs, trucks, and deliv-
ery vans for Amazon. Amazon is a 
major investor in Rivian. 
And we are not just seeing it in Nor-
mal. We are seeing evidence that our 
State, the State of Illinois, has a 
chance to become an EV State. 
I looked up in the Will County area. 
The Governor was there last week, 
talking about help for a plant that is 
going to build the heavy trucks and 
buses that are needed—electric vehi-
cles for the future. 
Go to Libertyville, IL, and there is a 
Dutch supplier of power generating 
equipment that is relocating some of 
its facilities in our State. 
And at the same time, Argonne Lab-
oratory has been doing research on bat-
tery technology and leading the Nation 
in doing it for years, and we believe it 
is a combination that really pays off. 
So how will our State or any State 
tap into this new economy? With 
trained and skilled workers, with fami-
lies that don’t have to worry day in 
and day out about daycare. 
We have to make sure that we are 
ready in Illinois and across the Nation 
for this opportunity. President Biden 
does. He understands it because he un-
derstands the challenges to working 
families. 
I can’t understand the opposition of 
the Republicans in Congress to Presi-
dent Biden. They seem to be deter-
mined to make sure that America al-
ways finishes a solid second. The Biden 
administration disagrees, and I do too. 
We have the capacity to continue to 
lead the world and to continue to lead 
the world’s economy, but it isn’t by 
sitting back and patting ourselves on 
the back and talking about who won 
the last election. We have to roll up 
our sleeves on a bipartisan basis and 
get this workforce ready and stand be-
hind our families that send these work-
ers into the plants that are going to 
create the products that are going to 
make a success story out of the 21st 
century. That is what President Biden 
is for, and I couldn’t agree with him 
more. 
I want to sit down and talk with any 
Republican who is willing to be honest 
and serious about doing this together, 
and we also ought to take on the other 
issues that we know plague our econ-
omy and our families—reducing the 
cost of prescription drugs, building an 
infrastructure for the 21st century.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2402 
May 10, 2021 
The truth is that last week’s job re-
port is a ringing endorsement for the 
American Jobs Plan and the American 
Families Plan of President Biden. 
Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, more than 220 million shots have 
been administered, and more than 100 
million Americans have been fully vac-
cinated, allowing businesses all across 
America to start to reopen. We need to 
build on the success of the American 
Rescue Plan, not dismantle it piece by 
piece. We need to work together to in-
vest in workers and families for the 
21st century, not grind Congress to a 
halt, as some might prefer. 
The American Jobs Plan will enable 
American workers and businesses to 
build on those successes. It will help 
reduce barriers for entry to many 
workers. It will direct billions of dol-
lars toward helping dislocated workers 
develop new skills and secure a stable, 
well-paying job, building wind turbines 
or electric vehicles or making other 
American-made goods that will be in 
high demand in the years to come. 
Another priority for Democrats is 
throwing a lifeline to working parents. 
Fortunately, 
we 
have 
made 
some 
progress on that front with the child 
tax credit expansion and other provi-
sions in the American Rescue Plan. 
Those policies put more money in the 
pockets of middle-class and low-income 
working families in the midst of the 
worst economic recession we have seen 
in decades. 
When President Trump left office, 30 
million Americans couldn’t afford to 
put food on the table. Think about 
that. Just 1 month after the American 
Rescue Plan, that number was reduced 
to 17 million, and we should never ac-
cept that or any number as acceptable 
in the future. We have cut the number 
of Americans going hungry by nearly 
half since President Biden took office, 
but we still have work to do. 
We need to provide more relief to 
parents so they can work a full-time 
job, if they choose, without having to 
worry about finding a safe, reliable 
place for the kids. We have to ensure 
that low- and middle-income families 
pay no more than 7 percent, that is 
what President Biden is asking, no 
more than 7 percent income on high- 
quality childcare. And that is on top of 
billions of dollars in funding the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan would invest in building 
and retrofitting childcare facilities 
across our State and Nation. 
Last week’s job report is a wake-up 
call. We can’t just wish this crisis 
away. We have to act and act together. 
We can’t reopen our economy fully 
until the virus is under control, and 
then we can’t wait for 10 years to get 
back on track to where we were a year 
and a half ago. 
We can’t build a prosperous economy 
for the future unless we address some 
of the systemic shortcomings that pre-
vent too many workers from partici-
pating fully. Even if next month’s job 
report exceeds expectations, such as 
the one in March, we need to rebuild 
our economy and put working families 
at the center of it, and make bold in-
vestments in the future right now. 
We can keep good jobs in America 
and build industries that have a future 
if we are ready to invest in American 
families. 
I hope our Republican colleagues will 
not say: Let’s go slow; let’s be satisfied 
with second. You know, maybe we just 
can’t compete with some other coun-
tries in the world. 
I don’t buy it. If we believe in Amer-
ica and its workers, we need to invest 
in them and their future. It is time to 
think bigger. It is time to believe that 
this country has a future which is 
going to be bright if we come together 
and do our job to stand by working 
families and the men and women—and, 
in 
this 
moment, 
particularly 
the 
women—who need that helping hand. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Ala-
bama. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, President Biden promised unity 
to bring the country together during 
his inaugural address. I was there with 
my 26-year-old son Tucker. We listened 
together and hoped that President 
Biden would live up to his words. I as-
sumed that when he said he would be a 
President for all Americans, it also in-
cluded the 75 million Americans who 
voted for Donald Trump. 
I was ready, and I still am, to work 
with President Biden in good faith to 
find commonsense solutions to prob-
lems facing the country and to ensure 
the voices of Alabamians are heard. 
But, so far, the President has neither 
united nor reached across the aisle. His 
actions have shown that he is fine to 
play along with the divisive tactics of 
the progressive left, rather than unite 
a large and diverse country. 
President Biden is acting like he is 
the President of New York and Cali-
fornia, not the United States of Amer-
ica. The progressives can barely con-
tain their excitement. The President 
received glowing reviews from leading 
progressive Members of Congress, say-
ing the President has ‘‘exceeded expec-
tations.’’ 
The left have been waiting a long 
time for an administration to imple-
ment their vision. They need to use a 
Trojan horse to put that vision into 
practice because it is remarkably un-
popular with a majority of the Amer-
ican people. 
Their vision is unpopular because it 
centers around a core belief of impos-
ing their vision on everyone. But to 
achieve this, that means taking away 
your freedom—freedom to think dif-
ferently, 
freedom 
to 
worship 
dif-
ferently, freedom for you and your 
family to live differently, freedom to 
spend your hard-earned money the way 
you want to spend it. 
Taking away those freedoms—free-
doms that are the foundation of Amer-
ica—is not progress. It is called social-
ism. 
When progressives talk about equity, 
they mean equal outcomes, not oppor-
tunities. They want a government that 
is so powerful it owns everything and 
chooses how wealth is distributed to 
ensure equal outcomes. That, in es-
sence, is socialism, and the folks pro-
moting this vision are channeling the 
same energy as the Marxists and com-
munists of the 20th century. 
Well, so far, President Biden has been 
a more willing partner to champion the 
progressive vision and export it from 
New York and California to every cor-
ner of the entire country. Just look at 
what has happened lately. One of Presi-
dent Biden’s first moves was to signal 
to the world that America’s borders are 
open. The result? Absolute chaos. And 
the administration shows little inter-
est in fixing it. We cannot have a coun-
try without borders. That is common 
sense. 
Democrats were so eager to undo all 
the work President Trump did at the 
border just because President Trump 
did it, not because there was merit in 
rolling back these policies. Because of 
this 
insane, 
open-door 
policy, 
the 
American taxpayer—not the Biden ad-
ministration but the American tax-
payer—is footing a $60 million bill a 
week—$60 million a week—to cover the 
cost of housing unaccompanied minors 
at the border—60 million. 
In the same rush, Democrats are 
working to undermine the integrity of 
the election process through H.R. 1 and 
S. 1, the Federal Government takeover 
of our elections. 
They are working to force millions of 
workers to join unions. They all want 
to strip States of their right-to-work 
laws, called the PRO Act. 
Democrats are using things Ameri-
cans desperately need, like traditional 
infrastructure, as a smokescreen for 
things Americans desperately don’t 
want, like the fantasy Green New Deal. 
And now Democrats in both Cham-
bers have introduced legislation to ex-
pand the Supreme Court. And because 
they don’t have the votes to ram this 
through the Senate—such an extreme 
agenda—many 
Democrats 
want 
to 
eliminate the filibuster, despite the 
fact that many wrote a letter asking to 
keep the filibuster just a few years ago, 
when they were in the minority. 
The bottom line is that the Demo-
crats want to change the rules so they 
can get their way, because they are to 
the point where they want to trans-
form our country, so said some of our 
leaders. 
As concerning as each of these ac-
tions have been, even more alarming 
are the progressives’ efforts to indoc-
trinate our children by favoring fringe 
theories over actual learning. For ex-
ample, the California Department of 
Education is considering using a cur-
riculum that says: ‘‘The concept of 
mathematics being purely objective is 
unequivocally false.’’ Their goal is to 
‘‘dismantle racism in mathematics.’’ 
Apparently, two plus two does not 
equal four anymore because it is not

politically correct. And just last year, 
the United States ranked 37th in the 
world in math—what a disaster. 
But here is the worst of all. The U.S. 
Department of Education recently in-
troduced a rule that would direct mil-
lions—millions—of taxpayer dollars to 
schools that promised teaching critical 
race theory and the 1619 Project for 
American history and civics. 
Put aside for a minute that these 
theories have been routinely debunked 
by historians and actively seek to di-
vide Americans on strict racial lines. 
Critical race theory’s central belief is 
that the law and legal institutions of 
the United States are inherently rac-
ist—so racist, they believe, that these 
institutions cannot be redeemed and 
must be completely replaced. The goal 
should be to have better laws and bet-
ter application of those laws, not to 
tear them down. 
For pushing this, it is not about unit-
ing our country, it is about fanning the 
flames of the unfortunate human tend-
ency to divide and separate into dif-
ferent tribes instead of uniting us 
around a set of common morals. 
Shouldn’t we be fighting that im-
pulse to divide into groups against 
each other? I think we need to do more 
uniting, and that should start in our 
schools, which is why I cannot believe 
that the U.S. Government is spending 
taxpayer dollars to teach our kids to 
dislike our country. How low have we 
sunk? These ideas are designed to drive 
a wedge between Americans based sole-
ly on their skin color. They openly re-
ject the goal of the United States of 
liberty and justice for all. 
Our schools should be places that en-
courage the open debate of ideas and 
teach important morals to our young 
people so that they know right from 
wrong. That is why I joined Leader 
MCCONNELL and 38 of my Republican 
colleagues to send a letter to Edu-
cation Secretary Cordona, urging him 
to withdraw these divisive grant pro-
grams. Part of our letter reads: 
Families did not ask for this divisive non-
sense. Voters did not vote for it. Americans 
never decided our children should be taught 
that our country is inherently evil. 
Secretary Cordona should redirect 
these grant dollars to American his-
tory programs that teach the ideals 
and morals that have made the United 
States the greatest force for good in 
human history. 
I spent my career in education—40 
years. I have seen firsthand how a qual-
ity education can put a kid on the path 
to success in our great country, regard-
less of their race, religion, or economic 
background. When done right, edu-
cation is the key to freedom. But the 
education we see in many schools 
today is just cementing existing in-
equality rather than giving kids the 
chance to escape it. 
We have got a clear trend here: un-
dermine border security, undermine 
the election system, undermine the Su-
preme Court, undermine the Senate, 
undermine our education system, un-
dermine our country. If your goal is to 
deconstruct and completely reshape a 
country, these are the steps that you 
would take. 
Our country is not perfect. There is a 
lot we have got to work on. But here in 
the United States of America, citizens 
have freedom and opportunities, and 
that is what we need to be focused on, 
not giving handouts, not dismantling 
our institutions but creating oppor-
tunity. 
We have the ability to make it bet-
ter. We have the rules to do so. Those 
rules are in place so that all of us can 
respect, if not always agree with, the 
changes that are made to make this 
country better. That is called democ-
racy. But changing the rules to force 
one’s vision on everyone isn’t democ-
racy; it is tyranny. My Republican col-
leagues and I will continue to stand 
against that. That is what America 
was founded on, after all, and it is what 
America needs now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF ANDREA JOAN PALM 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President and 
colleagues, very shortly, the Senate 
will vote on whether or not to advance 
the nomination of Andrea Palm to 
serve as the Deputy Secretary of the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. I strongly urge the Senate to 
support this nominee because Ms. Palm 
knows every nook and cranny at the 
Department. I will tell my colleagues, 
there is experience, and then there is 
Andrea Palm’s experience. 
During the Obama administration, 
Ms. Palm served in multiple senior 
roles at the Department of Health and 
Human Services, including serving as 
the Department’s Chief of Staff. 
She also served in the White House as 
a senior adviser on the Domestic Pol-
icy Council. Very importantly, she has 
played a particularly strong role in 
looking at policies to tackle the pan-
demic. She served recently as the head 
of the Wisconsin Department of Health 
Services. 
That 
put 
her 
on 
the 
frontlines against COVID–19. There she 
was a coalition builder. She brought 
together the State government, the 
healthcare sector, public health ex-
perts, and more to protect the people of 
Wisconsin and save lives. 
She led a collaborative effort to build 
the State’s testing and contact tracing 
program. And thanks to her hard work, 
Wisconsin, on a number of particulars, 
has moved ahead in the country on 
vaccinations. 
Ms. Palm started her career in social 
work, helping vulnerable kids and their 
families during times of crisis. During 
her Finance Committee hearing, she 
talked about how that experience set 
her on a path toward public service and 
how it is going to help her when she re-
turns to the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
She also mentioned a story that I 
thought was particularly relevant in 
these days of polarized government. 
She mentioned that former Secretary 
Burwell put her in charge of what was 
called the common ground agenda. Sec-
retary Burwell knew that Ms. Palm 
brought people together, Democrats 
and Republicans, to tackle big chal-
lenges. 
She said—and I note that there is a 
senior member of the Finance Com-
mittee here, our colleague from Texas. 
She said to our committee that the 
common ground agenda is the perspec-
tive she is going to bring to the De-
partment. You can sure sign me up to 
that proposition because there is a lot 
that needs to be done, as my colleagues 
know, when it comes to big healthcare 
challenges. 
I mentioned Ms. Palm is going to 
have to hit the ground running when it 
comes to the pandemic response as one 
issue. And my colleague from Texas 
knows, we are in the middle of a trans-
formation of Medicare. 
Back when I was director of the sen-
ior citizens—the Gray Panthers, Medi-
care was an acute care program. If you 
broke your ankle, Medicare was there 
for you. If you had a horrible case of 
flu, Medicare was there for you. Madam 
President and colleagues, that is not 
Medicare today. 
Today’s Medicare is chronic disease, 
cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and 
strokes. Millions of seniors have two or 
more of these conditions. In 2017, the 
Finance Committee, on a bipartisan 
basis, led the passage of the Chronic 
Care Act, dealing with modernizing 
Medicare, and we are very much look-
ing forward to working again on a bi-
partisan basis with Ms. Palm and Sec-
retary Becerra because there is a lot to 
do here, particularly as it relates to 
traditional Medicare. 
My colleague and I know together, 
because we have worked on these 
issues, that Medicare Advantage has 
really moved forward on many of these 
particulars, and we have got a lot to do 
on traditional Medicare. Ms. Palm is 
going to be instrumental in that effort. 
We also know, on another issue the 
Finance Committee is dealing with— 
that millions of Americans feel that 
they are getting mugged when they 
walk up to the prescription drug 
counter at their pharmacy. It is long 
past time for the Congress to step up 
and act to bring down the cost of peo-
ple’s medicine. The Senate Finance 
Committee has worked in a bipartisan 
way on that. There are other ap-
proaches that I support, particularly 
giving Medicare the authority to nego-
tiate and hold down prices. But we can 
work together in a bipartisan way on 
prescription drugs. 
Finally, there is an enormous agenda 
ahead of us in terms of major issues 
surrounding mental health care. I was 
given a report by the GAO just a few 
days ago that really highlights how we 
have seen so many people falling be-
tween 
the 
cracks 
in 
the 
mental 
healthcare system as a result of the 
pandemic; you know, rural seniors, for 
example, young people who perhaps are

facing 
learning 
challenges. 
They 
haven’t taken to remote learning. The 
law says that mental healthcare and 
physical healthcare are supposed to be 
treated equally, but based on this GAO 
report that was just given to me a few 
days ago, that is not the case. 
So that is just a handful—a handful 
of the major issues that Ms. Palm will 
have on her plate. It is critically im-
portant that we have all hands on deck 
there. This is a person who knows the 
Department front to back. 
When we vote here in a bit, with re-
spect to advancing her nomination, I 
hope that the U.S. Senate, on a bipar-
tisan basis, will vote for a proven 
healthcare leader, somebody who is 
committed to expanding and improving 
healthcare, who really understands the 
nuts and bolts of building healthcare 
coalitions in America. 
I see the Presiding Officer of the Sen-
ate who has been involved in this work 
in her State, the State of Illinois. We 
need these top-notch individuals who 
have been willing to serve, who are ex-
perts in their fields. That is what 
makes Ms. Palm so qualified for this 
position. 
I support her nomination fully. I urge 
my colleagues, when we vote this after-
noon at 5:30, to advance this important 
nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this 
has been a tough year since COVID–19 
became a global pandemic. There are 
many lessons to be learned from this 
pandemic. One of them that jumps out 
at me as being abundantly obvious is 
the real-world consequences of vulner-
able supply chains. 
We almost began to believe, because 
cheap consumer goods could be made in 
China or someplace overseas, that that 
was the optimal arrangement. And cer-
tainly consumers in America have ben-
efited from low prices when it comes to 
a number of things that are not made 
in this country. But some of the things 
that we depend upon, whether it is for 
public health or to keep our economy 
going or for our national security, are 
dependent on vulnerable supply chains. 
Perhaps the easiest one for every-
body to identify with was the shortage 
of personal protective equipment. I re-
member when I called my Governor in 
Texas, he said: Two things you can get 
us—more PPE and more testing. 
Well, we produce so much testing ca-
pability now you don’t hear much 
about that. But it was true that our 
hospitals needed masks, gloves, gowns, 
and ventilators to keep our frontline 
healthcare workers safe as well as 
other patients. At one point the situa-
tion became so dire, when it came to 
personal protective equipment, that 
first responders asked the public to 
help boost their supplies. They wel-
comed donations of N–95 masks from 
folks who had extra boxes in their ga-
rage or gloves from hair salons that 
had closed their doors. We didn’t reach 
that point because of the lack of prepa-
ration by those hospitals or healthcare 
workers but because of our reliance on 
other countries to produce that essen-
tial medical gear. 
China, it will surprise no one, is a 
major supplier of PPE. And since much 
of their stock was sent to hot spots in 
the earliest days of the pandemic, in-
cluding in Wuhan, we were left to rely 
on the relatively small number of do-
mestic 
manufacturers 
here 
in 
the 
United States. 
But I am here today not to talk 
about PPE but another supply chain 
breakdown 
with 
far-reaching 
con-
sequences, and this time it is semi-
conductors. While semiconductors are 
something that perhaps most people 
are not intimately familiar with—but 
let me put it this way: Anything that 
has an on-off switch involves a semi-
conductor. 
They are the underlying technology 
in our most used products, things like 
cell phones, computers, cars, tele-
visions, dishwashers. That is right, just 
about anything with an on-off switch. 
These are small integrated circuits 
that keep getting smaller and smaller 
and smaller, which means you can put 
them on a device like this; whereas, in 
the past, you may recall, Madam Presi-
dent, I remember the first cell phones 
that came out looked like a brick, but 
because semiconductors got so much 
more sophisticated and so much more 
powerful, you can put hundreds, per-
haps thousands, of them on a device 
like this. These chips are necessary not 
just for consumer products but for 
other things as well, like the cell tow-
ers that keep us connected and the ad-
vanced weapon systems that support 
our national security. Even ventilators 
at hospitals require semiconductors. 
In short, we need semiconductors for 
our most prevalent and critical prod-
ucts, but the vast majority of chips are 
no longer made in the United States. 
Taiwan dominates semiconductor man-
ufacturing, and one company, Taiwan 
Semiconductor 
Manufacturing 
Com-
pany, virtually controls the market. 
Last month, TSMC accounted for more 
than half of the total foundry revenues. 
Foundries are the manufacturing fa-
cilities 
that 
make 
semiconductors. 
Companies in Taiwan control 63 per-
cent of the global market. 
Well, you don’t have to look very far 
to see what a supply chain breakdown 
might look like because currently we 
are getting a taste of what it is like to 
not have access to the semiconductors 
that the U.S. economy needs. Right 
now, the demand for chips far exceeds 
supply. There is a global shortage of 
semiconductors that is creating serious 
impacts in nearly every industry, from 
consumer electronics to national secu-
rity. 
Texas is home to companies across a 
whole range of affected industries, and 
last week, I was able to sit down with 
leaders from a few of those companies 
in Dallas to learn more about the im-
pact of this shortage. 
We heard from a Hewlett Packard ex-
ecutive about the difficulties this has 
created in consumer electronic manu-
facturing covering a whole gamut of 
products. 
An executive from Raytheon, a na-
tional defense company, talked about 
how a steady supply of chips is impor-
tant to our national security. These 
tiny technologies, these tiny circuits 
help 
support 
American 
warfighters 
around the globe. 
We know now that the auto industry 
is among the hardest hit, and I heard 
from leaders last week from General 
Motors and Toyota about how their 
companies are coping. Chris Nielsen 
from Toyota said that when he first 
started with the company, you could 
count the number of chips on a given 
vehicle on two hands. That is certainly 
not the case today. Think about all the 
high-tech features in cars these days— 
navigation devices, Bluetooth, auto-
matic braking, backup cameras, and a 
variety of sensors. All of those depend 
on semiconductors, and that is on top 
of standard features like power steer-
ing, electric windows, air-conditioning, 
and windshield wipers. This adds up to 
dozens and dozens of chips for the var-
ious components of a single vehicle, 
and that supply is getting harder and 
harder to come by. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, 
automaker suppliers predicted a drop 
in car sales and canceled existing chip 
orders. Semiconductor manufacturers 
replaced the auto chip capacity with 
other in-demand things like personal 
computers for kids learning at home or 
more ventilators to use with COVID–19 
patients. But Americans kept buying 
cars at the prepandemic level. 
Unfortunately, the shortage of semi-
conductor manufacturing capacity and 
the long lead time for chip making has 
meant a shortage of chips that will 
likely last through the summer for the 
auto industry, and it has forced many 
auto makers to slash production be-
cause they simply don’t have enough 
chips, and they are laying workers off. 
Some have shifted production to focus 
on the most in-demand models, while 
others removed some of the tech bells 
and whistles. 
But the impact goes far beyond the 
options available on a car lot. For 
every production or assembly line that 
is cut, there are hard-working men and 
women who lose their jobs, as I said. As 
a 
reminder, 
this 
industry 
reaches 
across virtually every business and 
every national security company in 
America—automotive, consumer elec-
tronics; everything from the F–35, our 
fifth-generation stealth fighter, down 
to your cell phone, agriculture. Some 
of them even power children’s toys. 
Well, there is a clear problem with 
this vulnerable supply chain, and the 
question is, How do we fix it? How do 
we solve it? When we faced supply 
chain shortages at the start of the pan-
demic, companies of all types began to 
shift their manufacturing to help al-
leviate some of the strain. Distilleries

May 10, 2021 
in Texas and across the country began 
making hand sanitizer, and everyone, 
from big clothing manufacturers to en-
trepreneurial kids, produced cloth face 
masks. But with semiconductors, it is 
not that simple. In order to build a sin-
gle chip, you need a very expensive, 
highly advanced piece of equipment. 
You also need skilled workers, and you 
need a lot of lead time. It can take 
months to create a single chip. 
Building a new foundry, which is a 
manufacturing facility, is a huge and 
expensive undertaking. A single found-
ry can cost upwards of $10 to $20 bil-
lion. Yes, that is with a ‘‘b.’’ It is $10 to 
$20 billion for a single foundry. 
During our conversations last week 
in Dallas, a Qorvo executive talked 
about how the process of building a 
new chip fab isn’t just expensive, it 
takes a lot of time. It can take years to 
receive all of the necessary equipment. 
Time is of the essence, and fortu-
nately a solution is not as daunting as 
it could seem. In part because of the 
dependency of this vulnerable supply 
chain, particularly with Taiwan, Sen-
ator MARK WARNER, chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, and I 
introduced the CHIPS for America Act 
to help bolster our domestic semicon-
ductor manufacturing. When we first 
introduced this bill, the chip shortage 
wasn’t nearly as pervasive as it is now, 
but the writing has been on the wall 
for years. 
As our reliance on semiconductors 
has steadily increased, the U.S. share 
of global semiconductor manufacturing 
has decreased. Since 2000, the United 
States has dropped from producing 
roughly a quarter of the world’s semi-
conductors to only 12 percent. And I 
am sure it comes as no surprise that as 
our manufacturing capacity has gone 
down, China’s has gone up. In the same 
period of time, China has gone from 
manufacturing zero chips to 16 percent 
of the world’s supply, and it plans to 
invest another $1.4 trillion in semicon-
ductor technologies. 
Yes, America has lost ground to our 
global competitors, and unless we take 
action, it is estimated that by 2030, 83 
percent of global semiconductor manu-
facturing will be in Asia. This presents 
a huge risk to both our national secu-
rity and our global competitiveness, 
and we need to take action now to re-
verse the tide. 
That is what the CHIPS for America 
Act will do. The premise of this legisla-
tion is straightforward: create a Fed-
eral incentive program to encourage 
chip manufacturing in the United 
States of America. Rather than relying 
on foreign manufacturers or competing 
against other countries for the small 
supply of chips, let’s bolster the supply 
of 
American-made 
semiconductors. 
This way, we can secure some of our 
most vulnerable supply chains. We can 
create thousands of well-paying Amer-
ican jobs and boost our global competi-
tiveness by supplying made-in-America 
chips to our friends and allies around 
the world. 
In the 1980s, President Reagan and 
Congress led the defense budget build-
up 
to 
counter 
military-based, 
geostrategic threats that contributed 
to the end of the Cold War. This legis-
lation fills a similar purpose by secur-
ing our critical supply chain from the 
ever-evolving economic and national 
security challenges ahead. 
Other governments have made simi-
lar investments in semiconductor man-
ufacturing—not only China but South 
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Ger-
many, among others, including a more 
than $100 billion pledge to boost semi-
conductor manufacturing in the Euro-
pean Union. It is time for the United 
States not to just follow suit but to 
lead. 
The CHIPS for America Act has re-
ceived broad bipartisan support both in 
the House and the Senate, and it be-
came law in January. That is the au-
thorization part, but now we have the 
important job of backing these pro-
grams with funding. 
Back in February, I spoke to Presi-
dent Biden about the importance of 
getting this done, and I am glad to say 
that there is bipartisan, bicameral sup-
port, and the administration has made 
this a priority as well. 
Last month, I sent a letter to Presi-
dent Biden urging him to prioritize 
funding for these initiatives, and more 
than 70 colleagues, Republicans and 
Democrats from the House and the 
Senate, cosigned the letter. If we are 
looking for something important to do 
that has broad bipartisan support in 
both the House and the Senate and is 
supported by the Biden administration, 
this is it. 
Bolstering domestic semiconductors 
is good for our economy, our national 
security, and our global competitive-
ness. This current shortage is a re-
minder of how critical it is to take ac-
tion today so a lean supply of semi-
conductors does not become the new 
normal. We have a big opportunity 
ahead of us, and success is our only op-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today I want to discuss an unfortunate 
trend that has grown over the last 
year. 
Since March of 2020, the United 
States has been battling COVID–19. We 
have lost over half a million Americans 
because of the virus. But I am talking 
about another tragedy today, and that 
is the tragedy that I call ‘‘war on the 
cops.’’ 
Two months after the pandemic hit 
and sparked by the death of George 
Floyd, cities all across the country 
broke out into violent riots. Much of 
that violence has been directed at law 
enforcement, and it has taken a very 
serious toll. 
During the 2020 riots, more than 900 
law enforcement officers were injured, 
including 277 officer injuries while de-
fending the Federal courthouse in 
Portland and 60 Secret Service officers 
defending the White House. In Sep-
tember, a gunman ambushed two Los 
Angeles sheriff police deputies as they 
sat in their squad car. In January 2020, 
a violent mob attacked police defend-
ing the Capitol. Just last month, a 
young man killed a Capitol Police offi-
cer performing his duties. 
Police across the country are suf-
fering from demoralization and fatigue. 
By the end of last summer, police offi-
cers were quitting the force in large 
numbers. Last August, 49 officers re-
tired from the Portland Police Bureau 
in Oregon. That is more than it lost in 
all of 2019. By the end of last summer, 
140 officers had quit the Atlanta Police 
Department by that point in the year. 
That number had been only 80 in the 
previous year. In Washington, DC, over 
300 officers have quit since last June. 
Only half of those were retirements; 
the other half just walked away. 
We must consider, what does that 
mean for the crime in these cities? In 
Portland, murders increased 60 percent 
in 2020 from the year before. Arsons 
were up 95 percent. In Atlanta, murders 
were up 62 percent in 2020 from the 
year before. Aggravated assault was up 
by 15 percent. In Washington, DC, here, 
murders were up 22 percent in 2020 from 
the year before. So far this year, mur-
ders are up even more—33 percent so 
far in 2021 compared to this point last 
year. Professor Paul Cassell at the Uni-
versity of Utah estimates that reduced 
policing in dangerous neighborhoods 
last year caused an additional 1,200 
homicides in America’s largest cities. 
But the problem isn’t just with keep-
ing police officers on the force; there is 
also a problem with getting new ones 
as well, including in my State of Iowa. 
Recently, the Des Moines Police De-
partment reported it had received half 
the applications it did last year. At the 
county level, the Polk County Sheriff’s 
Office usually gets hundreds of applica-
tions for deputy vacancies but recently 
got only 50 applications. The Council 
Bluffs Police Department told me at 
one of my recent county meetings that 
it was having the same recruiting dif-
ficulties. 
This is a problem that police depart-
ments are having all over the country, 
with hundreds of vacancies across cit-
ies like Louisville, New York, Philadel-
phia, and Portland. How could this be? 
Well, for the last year, there has been 
a lot of hatred and vitriol directed at 
the police. If a police officer uses exces-
sive force, he or she should suffer the 
consequences, but it often seems like 
our national media would have us be-
lieve that any use of force by police is 
unjustified.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2406 
May 10, 2021 
Even Members of Congress some-
times join this sort of demagoguery. A 
month ago, Congresswoman RASHIDA 
TLAIB tweeted, ‘‘No more policing, in-
carceration, 
and 
militarization. 
It 
can’t be reformed.’’ Back in January, 
Congresswoman CORI
BUSH
tweeted, 
‘‘Defunding the police isn’t radical, it’s 
real.’’ This sort of talk is dangerous for 
people in neighborhoods that depend 
heavily on police officers to keep them 
safe. 
Law enforcement officers have to 
make split-second decisions that could 
be the difference of life or death for 
themselves or someone they are trying 
to protect. That is what we train them 
to do. Sadly, we sometimes need them 
to use force in order to keep the rest of 
us safe. 
Now, we are used to seeing videos on 
the internet of police officers using 
deadly force. But if you want to see 
really good policing in action, I would 
suggest people look at another video. It 
is on the internet. Just do a simple 
search of ‘‘Los Angeles deputy Mer-
cedes Benz.’’ You will come across a 
video of a Los Angeles sheriff’s deputy 
doing a routine traffic stop of a driver 
who had been using her phone while be-
hind the wheel. In this video, the driver 
calls the deputy a ‘‘murderer’’ and then 
mocks him for being Hispanic and 
taunts him for supposedly wishing he 
were White. That video will make your 
stomach turn. But throughout the 
video, the deputy is courteous and pro-
fessional. I suspect nearly all enforce-
ment officers conduct themselves and 
their work in that way. They have a 
very hard job to do and deal with peo-
ple who often don’t want to deal with 
the police. Most of them do that job 
very professionally and respectfully. 
I worry that because of the threat of 
violence, the condemnation by the 
media, and daily abuses like this one, 
more and more police officers won’t 
want to do the job anymore. And I 
worry that more and more young 
adults won’t want to start careers in 
law enforcement. We need more quali-
fied people who want to be police offi-
cers, not fewer. 
We can’t keep up like this. We can’t 
keep scaring away our police officers 
while telling the next generations of 
Americans that cops are evil. They are 
not evil. They are our friends and 
neighbors who make a career out of 
keeping us safe. When the outside 
world becomes a dangerous place, they 
show up and we expect them to show 
up. 
The outside world is not going to 
stop being a dangerous place. Let’s 
make sure cops don’t stop showing up. 
Let’s end the war on cops. 
CHINA 
On another subject, Madam Presi-
dent, dealing with my oversight work, 
on March 10 of this year, I came to the 
floor about my February 11, 2021, over-
sight letter to the Biden administra-
tion’s Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. That letter discussed the adminis-
tration’s withdrawal of what has been 
called the Confucius rule associated 
with the country of China and probably 
more closely related to the Communist 
Party of China. The rule that was with-
drawn was proposed in the Trump ad-
ministration, and it would have re-
quired educational institutions to just 
simply disclose their financial connec-
tion to the Communist Chinese Gov-
ernment, including its Confucius Insti-
tutes. 
The substance of the rule is common 
sense, especially in light of the clear 
propaganda threat that the regime of 
China presents to us. It is common 
sense, so why wouldn’t the Biden ad-
ministration continue with it? 
In 
my 
letter, 
I 
ask 
Secretary 
Mayorkas two very simple questions: 
One, does the Biden Department of 
Homeland Security consider Confucius 
Institutes to be an extension of the 
Chinese Government? If not, why not? 
Second question: Does the Biden De-
partment of Homeland Security con-
sider Confucius Institutes to be pur-
veyors of Communist Chinese propa-
ganda? If not, why not? 
When I took to the floor on March 10, 
the Biden administration had failed to 
respond. As of today, still no response. 
These are very easy questions for the 
administration. The failure to answer 
in light of the ongoing threat is very 
troubling. 
Just the other week, the Justice De-
partment indicted an American pro-
fessor on two counts of wire fraud and 
one count of making a false statement 
for concealing support he received from 
the Chinese Government. The indict-
ment tells me this administration has 
concerns about China and our univer-
sities, or this action would not have 
been taken. 
During the course of my oversight 
activities, 
I 
have 
looked 
at 
both 
threats to taxpayer-funded research 
and threats that Confucius Institutes 
pose to our educational institutions. 
Simply put, these are real concerns. 
With respect to threats to taxpayer- 
funded research, we must protect our 
intellectual property and research. The 
Chinese are stealing our intellectual 
property every day. We all know that. 
We spend billions of dollars and ex-
pend a great amount of effort to bring 
innovations to this country and, in 
turn, the world. We must protect our 
American investments from Chinese 
espionage and theft. 
Likewise, we must guard against the 
propaganda spread by Confucius Insti-
tutes, which are extensions of the Com-
munist regime. 
One member of the Communist re-
gime said this: 
The Confucius Institute is an appealing 
brand for expanding our culture abroad. It 
has made an important contribution toward 
improving our soft power. The ‘‘Confucius’’ 
brand has a natural attractiveness. Using 
the excuse of teaching Chinese language, ev-
erything looks reasonable and logical. 
Now, I want to quote the Chinese 
Minister of Propaganda, who said to 
his fellow ministry workers: 
[C]oordinate the efforts of overseas and do-
mestic propaganda, [and] further create a fa-
vorable international environment for us. 
With regard to key issues that influence 
our sovereignty and safety, we should ac-
tively carry out international propaganda 
battles against issues such as Tibet . . . Tai-
wan, human rights. 
Our strategy is to proactively take our cul-
ture abroad. We should do well in estab-
lishing operating overseas cultural centers 
and Confucius Institutes. 
Why would any American doubt Chi-
na’s purpose for Confucius Institutes 
based upon the quote of that Minister? 
Yet, even with this very clear threat, 
the Biden administration is silent on 
the proposed rule other than their get-
ting caught retracting that Trump 
rule. What more does this administra-
tion need before they get the picture? 
Given the administration’s failure to 
act, I have introduced a bill, S. 1369, 
that would make the rule that they 
have withdrawn now a law. My bill, 
which 
is 
cosponsored 
by 
Senators 
BLACKBURN, TILLIS, and HAWLEY, would 
require U.S. educational institutions to 
disclose their financial connections 
with the Communist Chinese regime. 
My bill would accomplish these meas-
ures by requiring schools to disclose 
those connections as part of their cer-
tification and recertification in the 
Student and Exchange Visitor Pro-
gram. That program provides approvals 
to schools to enroll nonimmigrant stu-
dents. If the schools want visas for 
these foreign students, they will first 
have to disclose their ties to the Chi-
nese Government. 
The centerpiece of the bill I just de-
scribed is disclosure and transparency, 
and we all know that transparency 
brings accountability. We the people 
absolutely have a right to know if our 
educational institutions are tied to the 
hip with China, especially in light of 
that regime’s using money to gain le-
verage over many of them, which 
brings me, then, to a greater point. 
American 
educational 
institutions 
ought to stand up to the Communist 
regime instead of doing their bidding 
for the millions of dollars they receive. 
China is a national security threat. 
They are a propaganda machine, and 
we know they will stop at nothing in 
their attempt to dominate the world. 
It is time for the Biden administra-
tion to step up to the plate and protect 
our American interests and American 
institutions. If they don’t let that rule 
of the previous administration stay in 
place or put it back in place, I would 
urge my colleagues to join my trans-
parency bill. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Madam President, on one final point, 
I would like to call once again for both 
sides to stop using elections as a par-
tisan weapon. 
As I have mentioned before, the 
claim by some Trump supporters that a 
certain 
brand 
of 
voting 
machine 
switched votes was lifted entirely from 
the Democrats’ 2004 playbook. Presi-
dent Trump’s questioning of his loss in 
Georgia was simply following in the

footsteps of the losing candidate for 
Governor 2 years before. She lost by 
over 50,000 votes and has never even 
bothered to try to prove voting irreg-
ularities on that scale. 
Just ask Georgia Secretary of State 
Brad Raffensperger, who got into hot 
water from Trump supporters and was 
briefly celebrated by the Democrats for 
defending the integrity of the Georgia 
election. He will be the first to tell you 
that attacks on Georgia’s election sys-
tem started not with Trump but with 
Democrats. 
Democrats decided to take their par-
tisan election attack nationwide. This 
is what led to H.R. 1, the so-called by 
Speaker PELOSI For the People Act. 
The title alone reveals it as a propa-
ganda bill. They didn’t take the time 
to draft something from scratch since 
the purpose was partisan messaging, 
not enacting thoughtful reform of our 
election laws. They just cobbled to-
gether every election mandate bill in-
troduced by a Democrat in recent years 
into one giant package, taking little 
care to make sure it all made sense to-
gether and without working with local 
election officials to see if it was even a 
practical approach. 
Democrats have now reframed the 
same bill in a response to what they 
call the big lie, that the 2020 election 
was illegitimate, but it was actually 
written in 2019 to double down on 
Democrats’ own big lie questioning the 
legitimacy of the various elections 
they lost in 2018. 
America’s elections are free and fair. 
That is true in Iowa, in Georgia, and 
all 50 States. It was true in 2018 and in 
2020, and I am confident it will be true 
in 2022. 
Foreign adversaries like Russia and 
China cast doubt on the soundness of 
our democratic system both to weaken 
it from within and to justify their own 
repressive regimes. Influence efforts to 
do just that have been part of the KGB 
playbook 
for 
decades. 
But 
foreign 
agents can’t hold a candle to what we 
Americans are doing to ourselves. Cast-
ing doubt on elections may be good pol-
itics in the short run, but it does real 
damage in the long run. Let’s all agree 
to stop this sort of peddling of doubts 
about the elections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
JOBS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I hope that you had a marvelous 
Mother’s Day. I enjoyed so much being 
back in Tennessee, and over the past 
week, I really had the pleasure of hear-
ing from so many Tennesseans who are 
just celebrating having reopened busi-
nesses and music venues and public 
spaces in our communities. 
There was a lot of happiness across 
our State as I was there. Everywhere 
you looked, you could see evidence 
that people are ready to get back to 
work, and they want to get back to life 
as normal. 
There is also a lot of evidence that 
local businesses are ready to get back 
to normal. You cannot walk 10 feet in 
Knoxville, TN, for example, without 
running into a ‘‘help wanted’’ sign. 
Normally, this would be an indicator of 
a successful economic comeback, but 
here is the problem: Those signs just 
are not working, not for retail or res-
taurants or even for the industrial sec-
tor with small business manufacturing. 
Some businesses are getting so des-
perate for help that they are offering 
signing bonuses worth hundreds of dol-
lars to anyone willing and able to come 
back to work. 
All year, we have used a particular 
catchphrase to encourage people to get 
their vaccinations. We have said that if 
we could only get shots in arms, then 
we could get back to normal. Well, as 
it turns out, that was step 1. We are 
getting the shots in arms. People are 
getting vaccinated. Now it is time for 
step 2, and that is getting people back 
to work, getting them to fill these jobs. 
I have said time and again and I will 
say it again: The best economic stim-
ulus there is, the very best economic 
stimulus there is, is a job. It is a job. 
This holds true not just for those pull-
ing in a paycheck but for the busi-
nesses that are hiring. 
My Democratic colleagues—many of 
them—disagree with me on this point, 
but I firmly believe the best economic 
stimulus is a job. For months, some 
have refused to discuss an end to the 
various emergency relief programs we 
all agreed were necessary to help work-
ers 
and 
businesses 
survive 
the 
lockdowns. But they were never meant 
to be permanent programs; they were 
there for a time of specific need. 
I think, if some of my colleagues 
took the time to speak to the owners 
whose businesses are short on labor, 
they would hear the same story over 
and over again. Their pool of potential 
employees was drained dry, at least in 
part by the unemployment insurance 
plus-up that we initiated last year. Be-
cause of the way that program was de-
signed and because my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle rejected our 
offers to amend it, potential employees 
are drawing in more in unemployment 
than they would make at some jobs. 
Now, some of my colleagues across 
the aisle dispute the notion that this 
imbalance has led to a labor shortage. 
They claim that if there are people 
staying home and collecting unemploy-
ment rather than taking their old job 
back, or maybe a new job, that those 
examples are anecdotal. But to that 
point, I would ask: How many anec-
dotes does it take to create a trend? 
In Tennessee, there are at least a 
quarter of a million jobs available, but 
as of last week, we still have about 
49,000 people receiving the $300 plus-up. 
This means that there are five jobs— 
five—five jobs available for every sin-
gle one of those 49,000 people. 
I want to make it clear that these 
business owners have no reason to lie 
about the trouble they are having find-
ing help. Their survival depends on 
their ability to hire a team of employ-
ees. They gain nothing by poisoning 
the well with false accusations. Anyone 
who has ever run a business knows 
that. 
They also know it is a difficult call 
for these potential employees to make, 
even when signing bonuses and higher 
wages are on the table, but therein lies 
the disconnect. While businesses are 
incentivized to do all they can to at-
tract workers, the Federal Government 
has incentivized workers to hold out as 
long as they can before taking the leap 
into a new job. It is not their fault, but 
it is the reality that Congress created. 
What we are seeing now isn’t eco-
nomic stimulus. I would offer that it is 
an economic stalemate. And if we don’t 
break the ties that bind recovery to 
the success or failure of a government 
program, we will suffer long-term eco-
nomic consequences. 
As I said, some of my Democratic 
colleagues 
fundamentally 
disagree 
with that approach. They have made 
that disagreement clear to the tune of 
$6 trillion worth of spending that 
would be like nothing else that we have 
ever seen and making it a permanent 
part of our economic landscape. 
They gave us a COVID relief package 
that had almost nothing to do with 
fighting the pandemic, an infrastruc-
ture proposal that dedicates 60 per-
cent—60 percent of its total pricetag to 
job-killing proposals like the Green 
New Deal fantasies and, most recently, 
a supposedly pro-family proposal that, 
if implemented, will in fact replace the 
stability of the nuclear family with a 
lifelong tether to the welfare state. 
Talk about never letting a crisis go 
to waste. This isn’t compassion, in my 
opinion, and it isn’t recovery. This is a 
power grab. They took the majority, 
put pen to paper, and produced a wish 
list. They have wanted to check off 
items from that wish list since 2010. So 
their list is long. 
This version of economic stimulus, 
which, in reality, is just a destructive 
cycle of spending and dependency and 
taxation and inflation, will require 
more than just a general buy-in from 
the American people. They are going to 
have to persuade people to cede author-
ity, to cede authority over their lives, 
their families, their businesses, their 
jobs, their employment—cede that au-
thority to the Federal Government. 
Now, if this isn’t true, if this isn’t 
their goal, let the Democrats dispute 
it. Let them come to the table and lis-
ten to what these business owners are 
telling us. Let them help figure out a 
way to offer a light at the end of the 
tunnel to the unemployed and under-
employed instead of keeping them tan-
gled in a safety net that was neither 
designated nor intended to be perma-
nent. 
We still have a long way to go before 
we 
can 
declare 
victory 
over 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. But what my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
refuse to acknowledge is that we will 
never make it across the finish line if 
we don’t allow the American people to

hope for that victory. We need to allow 
them to hope that last month’s terrible 
jobs report was just an anomaly. I cer-
tainly hope it was. 
And most importantly, we need to 
allow them to remember that a little 
over a year ago, we didn’t have to rely 
on emergency supplements and direct 
payments from the government to sur-
vive. We had the most robust economy 
we had in decades and decades. Unem-
ployment numbers were at record lows. 
Wage gains were at record highs. 
So we have been there before. We can 
and we will recover. But encouraging 
total reliance on the government is not 
going to be what gets us there, espe-
cially when so many businesses in this 
country are trying to hire workers, and 
workers are not taking the jobs. 
I yield floor.

GREEN JOBS PLAN 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss what 
I have seen happen now over the last 
100 days of the Biden administration, 
and that is President Biden seems to be 
doubling down on some of the failures 
of the Obama administration. 
Last week, as the ranking member of 
the Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee, I released a report, 
and it is called ‘‘Solyndra Syndrome 
and the Green Stimulus Delusion.’’ 
Solyndra syndrome. 
I tell you, I think it is an important 
thing to highlight because this 20-page 
report really is an in-depth look at the 
failed green energy policies under the 
Obama administration. Now what we 
are seeing is President Biden is deter-
mined, in my opinion, to repeat them, 
on a much larger scale. 
In 2009, under the direction of Presi-
dent Obama, Democrats passed a par-
tisan stimulus spending bill. The legis-
lation included $90 billion for green job 
training, for green energy loans, and 
for high-speed rail. It also included 
about $3 billion for a program more 
commonly referred to now as ‘‘Cash for 
Clunkers.’’ 
The goal was to produce millions of 
green energy jobs. They wanted to do it 
by investing taxpayer dollars in emerg-
ing green energy companies and also 
subsidizing new vehicles. 
So what did American taxpayers get 
for all of this money? What did they 
get as a return on this hefty invest-
ment? Well, they didn’t get the prom-
ised jobs. They got boondoggles. Bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars wound up 
wasted 
on 
green 
tech 
companies 
through loans or grants. Several of the 
companies then failed. 
The most famous of these was, of 
course, Solyndra. This was a solar 
panel company with many personal 
ties to the administration. It was lo-
cated in California and received over 
$500 
million 
in 
government-backed 
loans. Vice President Biden, at the 
time Vice President, was actually the 
one who announced that Solyndra 
would receive hundreds of millions of 
taxpayer dollars. 
Well, not too long after that, head-
lines across the Nation told the story 
of what happened next. In September of 
2011, the company failed miserably. 
More than 1,000 workers lost their jobs. 
Almost all of the 535 million taxpayer 
dollars were lost. 
The leadership of Solyndra lied about 
the company’s value and what they 
could produce. It also turns out they 
were big political donors to the Obama- 
Biden campaign and the Democrats. 
While the Obama-Biden donors got 
millions of grant money, taxpayers 
back then were left holding the bag. It 
was a terrible green gamble, and it had 
gone terribly wrong. 
It wasn’t the only one of these 
projects. Other companies like A123 
Systems, Beacon Power, Ener1, Fisker 
Automotive all received big govern-
ment-backed loans, and they all went 
bankrupt. 
The waste didn’t stop at loans for 
private companies. No, the Obama ad-
ministration gave a $3.5 billion grant 
to California for a high-speed rail 
project. This was California’s planned 
bullet train, and it was supposed to go 
from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 
Let’s fast forward 10 years and see 
where we are with that bullet train. 
After skyrocketing project costs, the 
Governor of California has recently 
thrown in the towel. Only a fraction of 
the original project is going to be com-
pleted, and delays continue to be an-
nounced. 
So you might ask: Well, why are they 
completing a small fraction of this 
railroad, this high-speed bullet train 
that was supposed to go from Los An-
geles to San Francisco? Well, by com-
pleting a small part of the original 
project, California can avoid having to 
pay back the taxpayers of the Nation— 
more wasted money. 
Americans clearly remember Cash 
for Clunkers. What a program that 
was. It gave subsidies to folks for the 
purchase of a new greener vehicle as a 
way to stimulate auto sales and auto 
industry jobs. The big problem was it 
didn’t work. One analysis found that 
the Cash for Clunkers Program created 
one job for every $1.4 million spent. 
That is quite a lot of money for a sin-
gle job. The program itself was a 
clunker, and it spent way too much 
taxpayer cash. 
The list goes on and on, as I have 
outlined in this report. The Obama ad-
ministration frittered away billions of 
taxpayer dollars. They chose people 
close to the administration to receive 
the money. The economy remained 
sluggish, and the taxpayers got fleeced. 
There actually was one bright eco-
nomic spot during the great recession, 
and, of course, I will tell you that was 
the oil and gas sector in this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2409 
May 10, 2021 
By the end of 2013, nonfarm employ-
ment was an anemic 1.9 percent higher 
than it had been at the end of the year 
in 2009. In contrast, the oil and gas sec-
tor’s employment was 16 percent high-
er. While the rest of the economy was 
stuck in the mud, the oil and gas sec-
tor was growing and creating American 
jobs. That robust job growth helped 
make America energy independent and 
secure. 
You would think that the lessons 
from the failed 2009 stimulus and the 
U.S. energy boom would be obvious and 
would be repeated today, but the Biden 
administration seems blinded by the 
Solyndra syndrome. President Biden 
wants to use the exact same playbook 
now and this time with a much heftier 
pricetag. 
The President wants to spend tril-
lions of dollars, not just billions. In-
cluded in that spending would be hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in green job 
training programs, green energy fi-
nancing, increased high-speed rail, new 
electric vehicles. It is the same plan 
that failed under President Obama. 
At the same time the Biden adminis-
tration is recycling the farfetched so- 
called jobs plan, the Biden administra-
tion is attacking oil and gas jobs—good 
jobs that people have today. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden signed an Executive order to kill 
the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now, this 
eliminated the prospect of 11,000 Amer-
ican 
jobs. 
Making 
matters 
worse, 
President Biden implemented a ban on 
new oil and gas production on public 
lands, a huge impact on my home State 
of Wyoming. A permanent ban on oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands could 
destroy up to 1 million jobs across 
America. 
My report finds the Biden adminis-
tration is pushing expensive fantasy 
jobs and killing real ones at a time 
that America cannot afford to lose 
these jobs. It is a recipe for repeated 
disaster. 
We all remember how President 
Obama promised shovel-ready jobs, and 
he then later admitted that the jobs 
weren’t coming, as he said, because 
‘‘shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready 
as we expected.’’ 
We know we can expect the same 
thing this time. The expensive, waste-
ful job-killing Solyndra syndrome is 
back. It was a terrible idea in 2009. And 
here we are a dozen years later, once 
again, spending a lot more, and doing 
that on the same bad ideas is now even 
worse than before. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING CLAIRE SERDIUK 
ANDERSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
month, we lost a generous and beau-
tiful soul with the passing of Claire 
Serdiuk Anderson. Claire devoted her 
life to public service. During her 46 
years on this Earth, she changed it for 
the better. As an Illinois native, she 
advocated for candidates and causes 
that pushed our State and country to 
be more like her: kind, gentle, and ac-
cepting. 
Claire was driven, in part, by her 
Catholic faith. She believed in her sa-
cred responsibility to help others, and 
she encouraged her friends and family 
to do the same, with a warm smile and 
a loving heart. 
Anyone would have been lucky to sit 
in the same room as Claire. She would 
captivate any audience with her gifts 
as a storyteller and her instincts as a 
comedian. In addition to graduating 
summa cum laude from Loyola Univer-
sity, Claire also studied at another 
venerated 
Chicago 
institution: 
The 
Second City Comedy Club. She used to 
say that her background in comedy and 
improvisation prepared her well for a 
career in politics. And I can think of 
more than a few politicians who would 
be lucky to have half of her charm and 
charisma. 
Claire played key roles in the careers 
of President Obama and other national 
leaders. She was the financial director 
for his first campaign for U.S. Senate. 
Claire also raised funds for my friend 
and 
colleague 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH 
when she first ran for Congress. In both 
instances, Claire was there from the 
beginning, investing her time, talent, 
and passion into two candidates who 
would go on to make history and in-
spire a new generation of American 
leaders. 
I came to know Claire during the 
early 2000s, when she worked in my 
Chicago office as my State scheduler. 
As part of my team, she was beloved 
for her tenacity and her good cheer. In 
her eternal wisdom, she left my office 
in 2004 to help a skinny community or-
ganizer in the South Side run for Sen-
ate but she remained, always, a treas-
ured member of the extended Team 
Durbin. 
In her final act of charity, Claire do-
nated her organs and tissues. I would 
like to think that, right now, someone 
may be seeing the world through 
Claire’s wise eyes, perceiving all the 
possibilities for our future, rather than 
settling for the ways things are today. 
I hope all of us can learn from 
Claire’s example. Loretta and I join her 
husband Kurt, her son Henry, her par-
ents Yvonne and Matthew, her brother 
Andrew, and everyone in her extended 
family, and so many friends, in mourn-
ing Claire’s loss. 
Thank you for your loving service, 
Claire. We will miss you.

REMEMBERING ERNIE WEST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Bluegrass State is home to many he-
roes. For centuries, brave Kentuckians 
have proudly worn the uniform to de-
fend our country and our way of life. 
Earlier this month, we said goodbye to 
one of these remarkable individuals. 
Ernie West, of Greenup County, was 
recognized in 1954 for his courage in the 
Korean war with our country’s top 
military recognition, the Medal of 
Honor. He inspired those who knew 
him and became an example of our 
Commonwealth’s highest ideals. Today, 
I would like to join Ernie’s admirers in 
paying tribute to his incredible life and 
offering condolences to his family. 
For Ernie, who came from humble be-
ginnings in a children’s home, putting 
his fellow soldiers’ safety before his 
own was practically second nature. 
During a patrol, his squad was am-
bushed by North Korean fighters. Ernie 
sprang into action, braving enemy gre-
nades and intense fire to carry three 
wounded comrades to safety. As he did, 
the young private suffered serious 
wounds, including taking shrapnel that 
eventually cost him his eye. 
After the war, President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower presented Ernie with the 
Medal of Honor in recognition of his 
valor and selfless sacrifice. Ernie never 
considered himself a hero and almost 
refused to accept the medal. He be-
lieved everyone who served with him 
was deserving of the same honor. In the 
years that followed, Ernie became a 
proud example of service to a cause 
larger than oneself. Kentucky was 
grateful to have this hero among us for 
so many years, and we will all miss 
him. 
Mr. President, the Daily Independent 
in nearby Ashland paid tribute to Ernie 
West and his heroism. I ask unanimous 
consent the article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-

A HERO’S LEGACY: WEST DIES AT 89 
(By Charles Romans) 
A young boy came home one day to find his 
father talking to a man he did not know. His 
father’s companion was rather ordinary, the 
young boy remembered, and appeared to be 
just like any of his neighbors he saw on a 
daily basis. But the father spoke up and said, 
‘‘Do you know this man? He’s a war hero.’’ 
Those words changed the young boy’s opin-
ion of the man, and he became fascinated 
with learning the man’s story. But the man 
just smiled and quickly changed the subject, 
asking the young boy instead where he liked 
to fish. 
The young boy was Tom Clay, of Greenup, 
and the man his father (well-known writer 
and community activist Soc Clay) intro-
duced him to was Ernest ‘‘Ernie’’ West. Clay 
remembers West as being a plainspeaking 
and easygoing man, and not at all what one 
might expect from a war hero. Clay said 
you’d expect a war hero to be larger than 
life, big and bold, but West wasn’t any of 
those things. 
‘‘He was just a normal guy,’’ Clay said. 
‘‘One of the neighbors who really liked to 
fish.’’ But even though West was hesitant to 
speak of it, Clay would later learn that West 
was not only a hero, but also a hero to whom 
other heroes looked as the very definition of 
the word. West died on Saturday at age 89. 
The man who talked so readily about fish-
ing at the Clay home was a Greenup County 
native himself. He was born on Sept. 2, 1931 
in Russell and raised in an orphanage at the 
Methodist Children’s Home in Versailles.

West lived in Wurtland and worked on what 
is now CSX Railroad. He was drafted in 1950, 
and in October 1952 he was serving as private 
first class with Company L, 14th Infantry 
Regiment, 25th Infantry Division in Korea. 
During a patrol, West’s unit was ambushed 
and took heavy casualties. 
Unit commander Captain George Gividen 
was seriously wounded, and West ordered 
those not wounded to retreat from the en-
emy’s larger force. West himself, however, 
didn’t retreat, but instead repeatedly faced a 
hailstorm of enemy fire and grenades to res-
cue the wounded members of his unit and 
carry them to safety. And in numerous 
cases, West faced not only area fire but per-
sonal attacks as well while rescuing his com-
rades. At one point, West was carrying his 
commander, while returning fire with both 
his own and his commander’s weapon. And 
though he said he wasn’t aware of when it 
happened, West became one of the walking 
wounded himself, sustaining wounds that 
would cost him an eye. But, in typical fash-
ion, when people referred to him as a hero, 
West simply responded, ‘‘They were all my 
brothers. Any of us would have done it be-
cause you don’t leave your brothers behind.’’ 
For his actions on that day, West received 
numerous medals, chiefly the Medal of 
Honor, which was presented by President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Again, true to form, 
West said, ‘‘I turned it down at first. I 
thought everybody deserved a medal.’’ But 
he did accept the medal on Jan. 29, 1954, 
though he was still reluctant to speak much 
of his time at war. And it was obvious that 
West desired first and foremost to return 
home and continue with his life. Fortunately 
for West, he was able to do just that, by 
marrying and starting a family, and even re-
turned to his job at the railroad. 
‘‘He was one great man,’’ said AMV Com-
mander Lori Grizzle, a friend who worked 
with West at the railroad. ‘‘Our post is 
named after him, and there are memorials to 
him at the post.’’ 
But as much as West the hero, Grizzle says 
she misses her friend. 
‘‘He was just such a nice person,’’ she said. 
‘‘He was funny and nice to be around. And he 
was always pleasant to everyone.’’ 
Grizzle said West didn’t really want to talk 
about himself, and while she and her hus-
band worked with him on the railroad, he 
was very humble and didn’t talk about his 
service. 
‘‘But his wife persuaded him to talk to 
schools because she thought that kids needed 
to know. And he was always great about 
speaking to the kids about what it takes 
sometimes to keep our country safe. It was 
the last thing he wanted to talk about,’’ 
Grizzle said. ‘‘But she convinced him, and he 
never hesitated then to speak to the kids. He 
will be dearly missed.’’ 
West also was immortalized in a painting 
that now hangs in the Greenup County 
Courthouse. A committee comprised of Soc 
Clay, Tom Crump and Emily Cantrell Ste-
phenson 
commissioned 
a 
painting 
from 
Greenup High School art teacher Brian 
Moser, and then sold prints of the painting 
signed by West, with the proceeds going to-
ward a scholarship for seniors at Greenup 
County, Raceland, and Russell. The scholar-
ship will continue, and Clay said that it has 
quite a large impact on the students. 
The official citation of West’s Medal of 
Honor reads: 
‘‘Pfc. West distinguished himself by con-
spicuous gallantry above and beyond the call 
of duty in action against the enemy. He vol-
untarily accompanied a contingent to locate 
and destroy a reported enemy outpost. Near-
ing the objective, the patrol was ambushed 
and suffered numerous casualties. Observing 
his wounded leader lying in an exposed posi-
tion, Pfc. West ordered the troops to with-
draw, then braved intense fire to reach and 
assist him. 
While attempting evacuation, he was at-
tacked by three hostile soldiers employing 
grenades and smallarms fire. Quickly shift-
ing his body to shelter the officer, he killed 
the assailants with his rifle, then carried the 
helpless man to safety. He was critically 
wounded and lost an eye in this action, but 
courageously returned through withering 
fire and bursting shells to assist the wound-
ed. While evacuating two comrades, he 
closed with and killed three more of the foe. 
Pfc. West’s indomitable spirit, consummate 
valor, and intrepid actions inspired all who 
observed him, reflect the highest credit on 
himself, and uphold the honored traditions of 
the military service.’’ 
Ernest ‘‘Ernie’’ Edison West is a shining 
example of how a common man can rise to 
the occasion and do uncommon things. His 
life both on active military duty and as a re-
tired veteran is a testament of dedication to 
the community and country he loved. West 
passed from this life Sat., May 1, 2021, at the 
age of 89. But he will live on in the memory 
of a grateful community and thankful coun-
try.

TRIBUTE TO WENDY CURRAN 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished career 
of Wendy Curran. Wendy will soon re-
tire as vice president of care delivery 
and provider affairs at Blue Cross Blue 
Shield of Wyoming. Her retirement 
marks the end of a remarkable career 
dedicated to improving the lives of peo-
ple in my State. 
Wendy Curran has been at the center 
of Wyoming health policy for over 30 
years. She earned the trust of folks 
across the State with her broad knowl-
edge of the challenges and opportuni-
ties for improving care in Wyoming. 
She forged alliances and friendships on 
both sides of the aisle, and both Repub-
licans 
and 
Democrats 
respected 
Wendy’s insights and relied on her 
unique knowledge. 
As the daughter of a third-generation 
rancher, Wendy grew up on the Peryam 
Ranch in the Upper North Platte River 
Valley. During this time, spent riding 
horses and playing in the Encampment 
River, she learned lessons that would 
later contribute to her successful ca-
reer. Daily chores taught her the value 
of hard work. She developed the ability 
to ‘‘heal up and hair over,’’ a cowboy’s 
term for resiliency. In fact, her grit, 
humility, and determination represent 
several of the key tenets in our State 
ethics code, the Code of the West: be 
tough, but fair; take pride in your 
work; do what has to be done. 
Throughout her career, Wendy held 
many distinguished jobs at all levels of 
government. She began by working for 
U.S. Senator Cliff Hansen. Other mem-
bers of Wyoming’s congressional dele-
gation also benefited from her work. 
Wendy served U.S. Congressman Dick 
Cheney and U.S. Senator Malcom Wal-
lop as well. 
In 1991, Wendy joined the Wyoming 
Medical Society. Wendy was the pas-
sionate voice of Wyoming physicians 
and patients, serving as the assistant 
director of public affairs and later lead-
ing the organization as executive direc-
tor. Wendy testified frequently before 
the Wyoming Legislature, advocating 
on behalf of Wyoming physicians and 
patients. She was known to introduce 
herself as a ‘‘representative to the peo-
ple 
who 
save 
Wyoming 
residents’ 
lives,’’ a job she took very seriously. 
She worked on many important pro-
vider issues. In particular, she was the 
leading voice supporting medical liabil-
ity reform. 
Wendy was instrumental in Wyoming 
joining the organization now known as 
WWAMI. This acronym stands for the 
States it represents: Washington, Wyo-
ming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. 
These States, working through the 
University 
of 
Washington 
Medical 
School, are part of a medical education 
consortium. This allows students in 
Wyoming to attend medical school at 
the University of Washington while 
participating in clerkships both in Wy-
oming and across the region. The pro-
gram gives the students wide exposure 
to practicing medicine in rural commu-
nities. Wendy deserves credit for help-
ing to bring this successful program to 
Wyoming, and she continues to serve 
on the University of Wyoming WWAMI 
curriculum review panel. 
In 2005, Wendy left the Medical Soci-
ety. Recognizing her skills, Governor 
Dave Freudenthal asked Wendy to 
serve in his administration. In this 
role, Wendy championed initiatives to 
improve childcare, substance abuse 
services, and an innovative Medicaid 
pilot program known as Healthy Fron-
tiers. Her talents for creating health 
policy were so respected that she also 
helped incoming Governor Matt Mead 
during his administration’s transition. 
That Freudenthal was a Democrat and 
Mead a Republican made no difference. 
Wendy proved yet again that partisan 
politics mattered far less than hon-
oring her commitment to the people of 
Wyoming. 
Wendy spent the last 10 years of her 
career working for Blue Cross Blue 
Shield of Wyoming. In the midst of 
widespread reform and changes, Wendy 
remained committed to improving the 
State’s health care system. Her excel-
lent communication skills and well-es-
tablished knowledge of the industry 
benefited her immensely. She em-
braced her role as a liaison between the 
insurance agency and providers, often 
bridging gaps and fostering connection. 
She ends her career as a trusted ad-
viser to all in the health care industry. 
In 2001, I was honored to join Wendy 
in the inaugural class of Leadership 
Wyoming, a program developed to in-
spire Wyoming’s leaders through explo-
ration and connection. Already an es-
tablished leader in her own right, 
Wendy fully committed herself to the 
8-month program and later became one 
of its most fervent supporters. 
Wendy also lent her talents and ex-
pertise to the boards of numerous non-
profit organizations. These included 
Peak Wellness Center, the Wyoming

Health Resources Network, the Wyo-
ming 
Small 
Business 
Development 
Center, and CLIMB Wyoming. Her 
work with CLIMB Wyoming is of spe-
cial significance. CLIMB is a unique 
nonprofit empowering single mothers 
to develop life and career skills. This 
holistic program helps these women 
start new careers and ultimately be-
come self-sufficient. 
Wendy’s accomplishments speak for 
themselves. She views herself as a 
humble public servant. Still, her im-
pact on health care in Wyoming cannot 
be understated and will be recognized 
for years to come. 
Finally, I must conclude my remarks 
by recognizing the most important peo-
ple in Wendy’s life, her family. Her late 
husband Denny was a good friend and 
an outstanding journalist. His passing 
in 2012 was a tremendous loss. I know 
he is looking down on Wendy, their 
three children, Katie, Laura, and Tim, 
and granddaughter Lillian, with pride 
today. 
Wendy and I have been personal 
friends for nearly four decades. She 
represents the best of Wyoming in 
every sense of the word. One could not 
have a better friend than Wendy 
Curran. 
The people of Wyoming are fortunate 
to have Wendy Curran serve our State 
for so many years. She is a leader, 
mentor, and advocate to many, espe-
cially women working in health care. 
Bobbi and I are proud to call her our 
friend. Wendy will be missed in retire-
ment, but I know she will continue to 
find meaningful ways to serve and to 
make Wyoming a better place for ev-
eryone. Thank you, Wendy, for your 
committed and dedicated service.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO OLIVIA VAN LEDTJE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Olivia Van Ledtje of 
Durham as March’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. Olivia, a 12-year-old book 
activist, 
creates 
videos—called 
LivBits—that seek to encourage chil-
dren around the globe to love books as 
much as she does. 
Olivia began creating LivBits when 
she was 8 years old as a way to over-
come bullying that she experienced. 
The videos gave Olivia a purpose and 
allowed her to find her voice. 
Olivia’s 
first 
video, 
which 
was 
uploaded to her mother’s social media, 
went viral and has more than 500,000 
views. Since then, Olivia has created 
many more LivBits about some of her 
favorite books and even hosted a 
podcast with authors as a way to get 
children her age excited about reading. 
Over the last few years, Olivia has 
travelled 
across 
the 
country 
and 
around the world to promote her love 
of reading and inspire others. Due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Olivia hasn’t 
been travelling as much, but because 
her work is built for the digital age, 
she is still able to share her message 
with children and teachers around the 
globe. 
Olivia’s passion for and dedication to 
promoting literacy and inspiring chil-
dren in New Hampshire and around the 
world to love reading represents the 
best of our State. By promoting self-re-
liance and self-empowerment through 
discovery and learning, I know that she 
will continue to do incredible things, 
and I look forward to everything she 
will go on to accomplish.∑

TRIBUTE TO STELLA LAVADIE 
∑ Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and share the inspi-
rational story of native New Mexican 
Ms. Stella Lavadie, who celebrated her 
100th birthday on April 29, 2021. Her 
friends, family, and neighbors know 
Stella as a warm-hearted woman who 
celebrates her veteran community with 
great pride and has lived a remarkable 
and impactful life. A member of the 
‘‘greatest generation,’’ Stella was born 
in 1921 in Taos, and while she grew up 
partially in Wyoming, she returned to 
New Mexico as a young adult to attend 
my alma mater, New Mexico Highlands 
University. In a pivotal moment, Stella 
recalls seeing Uncle Sam on signs in 
Albuquerque beckoning her: ‘‘I want 
you!’’ they said, and she answered the 
call. Stella enlisted for the Women’s 
Army Corps in 1944 at the Bruns Army 
Hospital in Santa Fe and trained at 
Fort Des Moines. Taking great pride in 
her fatigues and dress uniform, Stella 
completed duty stations in Kansas, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Da-
kota. Stella completed her service in 
1946 when the war was won, but she has 
said she would gladly have stayed in 
the Women’s Army Corps if given the 
chance. 
Throughout her life, Stella has car-
ried with her meaningful memories 
from 
her 
service, 
including 
fellow 
Women Army Corps member Ruby Hart 
singing ‘‘Till we meet again’’ and 
marching in formation every Saturday 
morning in front of the ranking offi-
cers. Upon returning home to New 
Mexico, Stella continued her Federal 
service working at the University of 
California in Los Alamos, then at the 
Atomic Energy Commission also in Los 
Alamos, before rounding out her career 
with a combined 32 years at the Bureau 
of Land Management doing essential 
work contributing to the management 
of New Mexico’s Federal lands. She 
raised three children as a single moth-
er in the 1950s, due to her husband’s 
early death, and built a beautiful fam-
ily in her own home State of New Mex-
ico. 
I want to personally wish Stella a 
happy 100th birthday and thank her for 
her service and barrier-breaking ac-
complishments. In 2015, I had the pleas-
ure of greeting Stella on her visit to 
D.C. on Honor Flight No. 0615, and I 
was honored to celebrate her birthday 
in a drive-by celebration this year. 
Stella, thank you for your service, 
and it is an honor to play a small part 
in your story.∑

TRIBUTE TO BENNIE MONTOYA 
∑ Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and share the inspi-
rational story of native New Mexican 
Mr. Bennie Montoya, who will cele-
brate his 100th birthday on August 20, 
2021. Bennie is a member of the ‘‘great-
est generation,’’ and his heroism and 
courage-filled life are an inspiration to 
us all. 
Bennie was raised near Santa Fe in 
the Village of Agua Fria as the young-
est of six siblings. After finishing the 
ninth grade at Harrington Junior High 
in Santa Fe, Bennie left school to help 
his family on their ranch, until he was 
drafted in August 1942. Bennie trained 
at Fort Bliss in El Paso, TX, prior to 
shipping out for Normandy to serve his 
country at one of the most significant 
battle sites in U.S. military history. At 
23 years old, Private First Class Mon-
toya landed in Normandy 6 days after 
D-day, and to this day, he recalls the 
bloodied waters and fallen soldiers 
from the momentous battle. 
During the war, he worked as a 
switchboard operator and also had the 
responsibility 
of 
driving 
his 
com-
manding officer from post to post. On 
December 17, 1944, when Private First 
Class Montoya volunteered to drive a 
senior military officer to the next post, 
he was ambushed by German soldiers 
and taken prisoner. As a prisoner of 
war, Bennie was forced to dig graves 
for Nazi soldiers who were killed in ac-
tion. He was often made to do hard 
labor in the freezing snow with no 
shoes 
and 
suffered 
frostbite 
while 
under their abuse. 
Private First Class Montoya was fi-
nally liberated in 1945 and sent to a 
POW rehabilitation and recovery cen-
ter in Santa Barbara, CA. Honorably 
discharged, Bennie made his way back 
to New Mexico unbeknownst to his 
family. The story of his homecoming 
speaks to the power of prayer and the 
bond between family members. His 
mother, as told by others with her on 
that day, kept a prayer card to St. An-
thony, the patron saint of lost people 
and things in her pocket. As she was 
cooking and praying, she was overcome 
with emotion. What followed was noth-
ing 
less 
than 
a 
joyous 
reunion: 
Bennie’s mother stepped outside to col-
lect herself and continued praying, and 
when she looked up and gazed across 
the fields, she saw Bennie walking to-
wards her, duffel bag in tow. 
Bennie has lived a full and meaning-
ful life since his time in the Army. 
Upon his honorable discharge, he was 
awarded several medals, including a 
Purple Heart. He raised four children 
in Agua Fria with his wife, Mary, be-
fore losing her to a drunk driver. Pro-
fessionally, Bennie worked in the local 
banking industry for 27 years. He still 
lives in Agua Fria, where he is an up-
standing and highly regarded member

TRIBUTE TO DR. EUGENE MORGAN 
HUGHES 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Dr. Eugene 
‘‘Gene’’ Morgan Hughes, a recognized 
leader in higher education at the local, 
State, and national level. 
Dr. Hughes was selected by the Ari-
zona Board of Regents as the 12th 
president of Northern Arizona Univer-
sity, NAU, in 1979. During his tenure, 
he established NAU’s Center for Excel-
lence in Education, the School of Hotel 
and Restaurant Management, and the 
Southwest Center for Forestry Science 
Complex. Dr. Hughes launched field 
sites on the campuses of Arizona’s 
community colleges, including NAU- 
Yuma, and initiated NAU-net, the first 
courses in the State offered via tele-
vision to off-campus sites. He also ex-
panded the New Momentum program to 
engage Native American Tribes and 
forged relationships with higher edu-
cation institutions in China. Under his 
leadership, 
NAU’s 
total 
enrollment 
rose from 12,000 to 18,800 students. 
Dr. Hughes retired from NAU in 1993 
and received the titles of president 
emeritus and professor emeritus of 
mathematics. He served as president of 
Wichita State University, WSU, from 
1993 until 1999, retiring as president 
emeritus. He later led Eastern Ken-
tucky University, EKU, as its interim 
president in 2001 before retiring to 
Flagstaff, AZ. 
Dr. Hughes was chairman of the 
American Association of State Colleges 
and Universities and president of the 
Arizona Board of Education. He was se-
lected as Flagstaff Citizen of the Year 
in 1988 and Outstanding Kansas Citizen 
of the Year in 1998. He also received the 
Arizona Board of Regents Medal. The 
School of Hotel and Restaurant Man-
agement building at NAU was named 
for him in 1997, and WSU dedicated the 
Eugene M. Hughes Metropolitan Com-
plex in 1999. Dr. Hughes received hon-
orary doctoral degrees from NAU in 
1997 and EKU in 2011. 
In retirement, Dr. Hughes remained 
active in the community, including as 
a member of the National Advisory 
Board of the NAU School of Hotel and 
Restaurant Management, chair of Am-
trak’s National Customer Advisory 
Committee, and co-president of the 
Flagstaff Society of St. Vincent de 
Paul. He was also president of the Mu-
seum of Northern Arizona. 
Dr. Hughes was a kind, intelligent, 
and diplomatic man who listened pa-
tiently, cared deeply, sought com-
promise, and treated everyone with 
dignity. All who interacted with him 
felt seen, heard, and appreciated. His 
wit, wisdom, and warm smile will be 
greatly missed, but his legacy endures 
in the memories of all he touched. 
Please join me in honoring Gene 
Hughes, a visionary in higher edu-
cation.∑

By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, and Mr. TILLIS): 
S. 1532. A bill to provide a work op-
portunity 
tax 
credit 
for 
military 
spouses and to provide for flexible 
spending arrangements for childcare 
services for uniformed services fami-
lies; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Jobs and Childcare 
for Military Families Act, with my col-
leagues Senators BOOZMAN and TILLIS. 
By incentivizing private businesses to 
hire military spouses and allowing 
military families to use pre-tax dollars 
to pay for childcare, we can alleviate 
some of the unique hardships military 
families face and put them on firmer fi-
nancial footing. This effort has only 
become more critical as the nation re-
covers from the coronavirus pandemic 
that has increased the number of un-
employed and emphasized some long-
standing issues in securing childcare 
for young families. 
The 
families 
of 
America’s 
servicemembers make sacrifices that 
are not as recognized in the public eye. 
Military spouses face routine moves 
every few years that require packing 
up a stable home in order to move to a 
new area and start over. This is com-
pounded by the complex system of 
state licensing and certification re-
quirements, which can limit these 
spouses from taking jobs that utilize 
their expertise and experience. Because 
of this, military spouses have unem-
ployment rates substantially higher 
than the national average, and are 
often underemployed when they do 
have jobs. Adding to the financial 
struggle that frequent periods of unem-
ployment and underemployment cause, 
the rising cost of childcare puts a sub-
stantial burden on many military fami-
lies. 
The Jobs and Childcare for Military 
Families Act would help these families 
in two ways. First, the bill makes mili-
tary spouses an eligible population for 
the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This 
tax credit has been proven effective in 
improving the employment prospects 
for other groups, and extending it to 
military spouses would help them find 
employment easier after moving a new 
area. Second, the bill instructs the ad-
ministration to implement dependent 
care flexible spending accounts for all 
servicemembers. These accounts which 
are widely available in the private sec-
tor would allow military families to 
contribute pre-tax dollars to accounts

that they can then use to pay for 
childcare services, helping ease the fi-

I hope my colleagues will support 
this bill to help families who have 
made an incredible sacrifice for our na-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2421 
May 10, 2021 
availability of medical nutrition ther-
apy services under the Medicare pro-
gram; to the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Medical Nutri-
tion Therapy Act of 2021, along with 
my colleague from Michigan, Senator 
PETERS. Our bill would expand Medi-
care beneficiaries’ access to Medical 
Nutrition Therapy, or MNT, which is a 
cost-effective component of treatment 
for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and other chronic condi-
tions. At a time when we have seen 
many diet-related chronic conditions 
contribute to poor COVID–19 outcomes, 
increasing access to MNT should be 
part of the strategy to improve disease 
management and prevention for Amer-
ica’s seniors. The Medical Nutrition 
Therapy Act would make two impor-
tant changes to support patients, im-
prove health outcomes, and reduce un-
necessary health care costs. 
First, it would expand Medicare Part 
B coverage of outpatient medical nu-
trition therapy services to a number of 
currently uncovered diseases or condi-
tions—including prediabetes, obesity, 
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
malnutrition, eating disorders, cancer, 
HIV/AIDS, gastrointestinal diseases in-
cluding celiac disease, and cardio-
vascular disease. Currently, Medicare 
Part B only covers outpatient MNT for 
diabetes, renal disease, and post-kidney 
transplant. 
Second, the bill would allow more 
types of providers—including nurse 
practitioners, 
physician 
assistants, 
clinical nurse specialists, and psy-
chologists—to refer patients to MNT. 
This is especially critical for a rural 
state like Maine where a NP or PA 
may be one’s trusted primary care pro-
vider. 
MNT counseling is provided by Reg-
istered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) 
as part of a collaborative health care 
team. It is evidenced-based and proven 
to positively affect weight, blood pres-
sure, blood lipids, and blood sugar con-
trol. Nutritional counseling by RDNs is 
recommended by the National Lipid 
Association to promote long-term ad-
herence to an individualized, heart- 
healthy diet. Through MNT, individ-
uals benefit from in-depth, individual-
ized nutrition assessments. Follow-up 
visits help reinforce important behav-
ior and lifestyle changes and increase 
compliance. 
Seniors deserve improved access to 
this cost-effective medical treatment, 
but many older adults are missing out 
under the current Medicare policy. 
Marcy Kyle, a RDN from Rockport, 
Maine, has seen many patients denied 
access to medically necessary MNT. 
One of her patients with prediabetes 
was referred by his primary care physi-
cian for MNT at age 64. At that time, 
his private insurance covered the serv-
ice, and he booked the first available 
appointment the following week. That 
same week, this patient turned 65 and 
transitioned onto Medicare. You can 
imagine his surprise upon arriving for 
his appointment and learning that 
MNT would not be covered. Fortu-
nately for that patient, the outpatient 
facility changed its process to prevent 
similar situations, but this example 
demonstrates how the current restric-
tions can be detrimental for older 
adults at a critical juncture in their 
journey to better health. 
Another unfortunate example from 
Maine was a patient with a new Celiac 
Disease diagnosis complicated by se-
vere weight loss. His private insurance 
covered MNT as Celiac Disease is a 
controllable disease with proper nutri-
tion. But when transitioning from pri-
vate insurance to Medicare, this pa-
tient, too, lost his access to MNT. This 
truly is a lost opportunity since we 
know early treatment with MNT can 
prevent future and more serious health 
complications and chronic conditions 
in older adults. Conditions such as 
prediabetes and Celiac Disease should 
be covered. 
The 
health 
and 
financial 
crisis 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic 
makes access to MNT even more im-
portant. Seniors with diet-related con-
ditions have suffered more than any 
other population in terms of experi-
encing the worst health outcomes, in-
cluding death. According to Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
data, among those hospitalized with 
COVID–19, 84 percent of patients had 
hypertension, 
68 
percent 
had 
hyperlipidemia, 51 percent had diabe-
tes, and 35 percent of patients were 
obese. Tragically, many of these pa-
tients were never able to leave the hos-
pital because they passed away. In ad-
dition to the human cost, there is a fi-
nancial one: the impact on the Medi-
care program. 
This should not come as a surprise 
since the health and economic impact 
of chronic diseases is staggering. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 90 percent of 
the $3.5 trillion that the United States 
spends annually on health care goes to 
the treatment of people with chronic 
diseases and mental health conditions. 
Preventing chronic diseases, or man-
aging symptoms when prevention is 
not possible, is one way to reduce these 
costs. This is particularly important 
for the Medicare program as more than 
two-thirds of seniors on Medicare live 
with multiple chronic conditions. As 
one Registered Dietitian Nutritionist 
in Maine told me, ‘‘we all know a dol-
lar spent on prevention saves many 
health care dollars in the long run and 
is the right thing to do for our seniors 
at a time when they have limited budg-
ets.’’ 
The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act 
of 2021 is supported by nearly 50 na-
tional 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 
the American Diabetes Association, 
the Endocrine Society, the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-
work, and UsAgainstAlzheimer’s. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation to improve ac-
cess to cost-effective medical treat-
ment for Medicare patients with chron-
ic diseases. 
Thank you, Mr. President.
