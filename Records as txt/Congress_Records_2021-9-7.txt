September 7, 2021 
HONORING KEITH PINTO 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 7, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Keith Pinto, a lifeguard 
who tragically lost his life on Monday, August 
30, 2021. 
To all of those who knew Keith, he was the 
perfect kid. To some, he was the exceptional 
crosscountry athlete at Toms River High 
School North and an individual who would 
make anyone feel welcomed. To others, he 
was a familiar face at the Jersey Shore where 
he served for four summers as a lifeguard. 
Keith’s commitment to protecting our com-
munity didn’t stop there; he had higher aspira-
tions. Once he completed his criminal justice 
degree, he planned on serving his country as 
a United States Marine. It is with that same 
heart to serve and protect that Keith gave his 
life protecting his beach community. 
During moments of tragedy, our commu-
nities rally together under around the theme of 
‘‘Jersey Strong.’’ This moment is no exception. 
The day after his passing, hundreds of peo-
ple—some friends, some fellow lifeguards, 
others complete strangers—gathered to pay 
their final respects at the 21st Avenue Beach, 
in South Seaside Park. This speaks volumes 
not only to the heart of the community, but 
more so to Keith’s character. 
Our hearts go out to Keith’s family and 
friends, and we wish them strength and com-
fort during this extremely difficult time.

IN RECOGNITION OF TALENT DAY 
IN THE GREATER GREEN BAY 
AREA 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 7, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to join my constituents, businesses and 
organizations of Wisconsin’s Eighth Congres-
sional District in recognizing the declaration of 
Talent Day in the Greater Green Bay Area on 
September 8, 2021. 
Northeastern Wisconsin, like much of the 
state and country, is hampered by a shortage 
of qualified workers to meet the needs of busi-
ness and industry. From manufacturing to 
health care, transportation to hospitality, every 
employer in the Greater Green Bay Area and 
Northeast Wisconsin feels the strain of a tight 
labor market. 
This reality does not come as a surprise. 
Talent attraction, development, and retention 
is a significant concern for the economic de-
velopment of our area. The Greater Green 
Bay Chamber has developed a strategic plan 
to attract talent to Northeast Wisconsin, and 
the Chamber and our community are working 
to implement that strategy. 
To highlight the growing need for talent and 
update the community on new initiatives, the 
Greater Green Bay Chamber, working with 
Brown County and the City of Green Bay, es-
tablished Wednesday, September 8, as Talent 
Day in the Greater Green Bay Area. 
Talent Day will raise awareness of the chal-
lenges employers face and foster conversation 
about how we can solve these problems to-
gether as a community. Events on Talent Day 
will include a presentation on talent hiring and 
employee development, hands-on workshops 
for hiring managers, and a roundtable discus-
sion on hiring in the Greater Green Bay area. 
On Talent Day, the Greater Green Bay 
Chamber will also publicly unveil a new com-
munity brand, and a new website designed to 
show the world everything that makes Greater 
Green Bay a great place to live. As employers 
recruit talent from all over the world, this 
website will help showcase our incredible 
community and attract the employees our 
businesses need. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my 
warmest greetings and congratulations to 
those in the Greater Green Bay Area who 
have come together on this effort and I ask 
that you and my other distinguished col-

CELEBRATING THE LEGACY OF P. 
DAVID CORRELL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 7, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the voice, heart and 
soul of Toms River High School South—P. 
David Correll. For over 50 years, Mr. Correll 
has had an indelible impact on the students, 
faculty and families of those lucky enough to 
call High School South their alma mater. 
After first arriving to the high school in 1964, 
Mr. Correll formed the Pep Club in 1966 and 
remained at the center of the school’s spirit, 
pride, and inspiration. Even after formally retir-
ing in 2007, Mr. Correll remained on as the 
school’s publicity coordinator and remained 
‘‘Voice of the Indians’’ by calling the Friday 
football games from the school’s press box. 
Beyond his contribution to the school’s spir-
it, Mr. Correll was an inspiration in the class-
room as an instructor of U.S. History, including 
students in the Advanced Placement program. 
He not only cared about the history of Amer-
ica, but about the history in his own backyard. 
In 2016, Mr. Correll spearheaded the effort to 
rename the entrance to High School South 
‘‘Gaiter Way’’ to honor the legacy of an immi-
grant African-American family that attended 
school there between the 1920s to 1940s, with 
one of the children becoming a Tuskegee Air-
man. 
Never a shrinking violet, Mr. Correll was ac-
tively involved with the high school band, team 
athletics and student government. He was 
honored to march in both Inaugural parades of 
President Jimmy Carter and President Ronald 
Reagan. 
As he prepares to hang up his megaphone, 
this weekend Mr. Correll will be honored with 
a Pep Rally to celebrate a legacy that will live 
on in the community of Toms River. I wish to 
express my deep gratitude and well-wishes to 
an educator who inspired many to do as much 
good as you can, for as long as you can. May 
the proud traditions at Toms River High 
School South continue with him in our hearts 
forever.

HONORING THE LATE JIMMY 
JENKINS 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 7, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor the legacy of Jimmy 
Jenkins—a veteran, educator, and inspira-
tional member of our Fort Worth community. 
Jimmy was born in Overton, Texas. Growing 
up in a small city he learned the value of com-
munication and appropriate attitudes toward 
others. He united with Zion Baptist Church in 
Overton, Texas at an early age. After high 
school he enlisted in the military. 
During his service in the Korean war, Jen-
kins earned the Korean Silver Medal with one 
Bronze Star, United Nations Silver Medal, and 
National Defense Silver Medal. He served 
eight years in the 3rd infantry division with no 
time lost. Upon his return home from the war, 
he obtained his Bachelors of Science and 
Master of Education from Prairie View A&M 
University. While playing basketball in college, 
Jenkins decided to become a high school edu-
cator and coach. He wanted to uplift, em-
power, and motivate students to achieve scho-
lastically and athletically. 
Jenkins began his teaching and coaching 
career in Terrell, Texas, and coached for five 
years before moving to Fort Worth, Texas. He 
finished his career at Arlington Heights High 
School as their first Black Assistant Football 
Coach, first Black Head Basketball Coach, 
and first Black Girls Soccer Head Coach in 
North Texas. Even after retirement, he volun-
teered with Jefferson ISD’s Athletic Program. 
A fervent believer in helping others, Jenkins 
established a scholarship fund at Zion Baptist 
Church in Overton, Texas, in his late mother’s 
name. 
He was a member of the Minority Business 
Coalition 
of 
Marion 
County,
