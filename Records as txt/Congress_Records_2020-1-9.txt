CONGRESS NEEDS TO FIX THE 
WAR POWERS ACT 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, unde-
niably the worst foreign policy mistake 
in the history of the United States of 
America was the invasion of Iraq based 
on phonied-up intelligence that was 
trumpeted by Dick Cheney, Scooter 
Libby, and other characters in the 
Bush administration. 
But just this last week, President 
Trump took us to the verge of an even 
worse foreign policy mistake in the 
Middle East. He recklessly and impa-
tiently took us to the brink of war that 
would have been even worse. 
Now, yesterday, I went to the so- 
called intelligence briefing. They of-
fered no intelligence regarding imme-
diate imminent threats to the United 
States, our troops, or allies in the re-
gion. 
They did certainly make a case that 
Soleimani was a rotten guy and he was 
responsible for many, many deaths of 
Americans and others in the region, 
but that is all recited past history that 
didn’t 
talk 
about 
any 
immediate 
threats or any intelligence that would 
lead to it. 
They further went on to say that the 
legal justification was the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force in the in-
vasion of Iraq, which, of course, was 
based on phony intelligence regarding 
weapons of mass destruction he didn’t 
have. So that is even more extraor-
dinary if you think about that. 
Last 
week, 
also, 
the 
President 
tweeted what he said was his compli-
ance with war powers. He then went on 
to tweet a threat of all-out war against 
Iran, and then he went further to tweet 
that he would order that war crimes be 
committed 
during 
an 
all-out 
war 
against Iran. 
That was walked back a little bit by 
the Secretary of Defense who said they 
would follow the law. And then Trump 
later said: I like laws. I will follow the 
laws. So he walked back from saying 
he was going to destroy cultural 
threats a little bit. 
Today, on the floor of the House, we 
will take up a rebuke of the President 
for those actions. Hopefully, we will go 
further and we will repeal the Author-
ization for Use of Military Force from 
2002 based on fake intelligence. 
We will further, hopefully, take up 
legislation that was adopted as an 
amendment to the defense authoriza-
tion last summer, with bipartisan sup-
port, to say that the President couldn’t 
initiate hostilities against Iran with-
out first coming to Congress. 
Congress has the authority, and only 
Congress has the authority, to declare 
war. Once we are at war, the President, 
as Commander in Chief, can utilize the 
Armed Forces as he sees fit. 
But the President does not have the 
authority. This is extraconstitutional 
when it isn’t an attack or an imminent 
attack on the United States, its troops, 
or its citizens. 
So we need to do those things. 
Further, we need to fix the War Pow-
ers Act. That was adopted after the il-
legal actions of another President, 
Richard Nixon, the bombing of Cam-
bodia. 
There were two versions. One fol-
lowed the Constitution, and said, no, 
no, any offensive actions into hos-
tilities you first have to come to Con-
gress. The second version said, well, 
you can initiate them, but you have to 
report within 48 hours, and if Congress 
doesn’t authorize it within 60 days, you 
have to withdraw. That was defective 
and weak and doesn’t reflect at all the 
congressional duties of this body. 
Now, I know a lot of Members love to 
dodge the issues of war and peace—it is 
the toughest vote you can make—and 
that is essentially what they did at the 
time, a wink and a nod: Well, we will 
let the President do these things. Hey, 
if it works out, we will take credit; if 
it doesn’t work out, oh, well, then we 
can castigate him later. 
So I have introduced, yet again, a bill 
that comprehensively reforms the War 
Powers Act to reflect the constitu-
tional authorities and duties of the 
United States Congress. It would say 
that the President cannot initiate hos-
tilities without first coming to Con-
gress. 
It would define what consultation 
means. It doesn’t mean a tweet to the 
Congress. It doesn’t mean sending up a 
letter. It means a meaningful consulta-
tion. It establishes an executive legis-
lative consultative group. 
It also includes, most importantly, a 
sunset clause for any authorization by 
Congress. 
I mean, a thousand years from now, 
the United States, I guess, if we don’t 
repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force, can attack whatever 
Iraq is a thousand years from now. 
That is absolutely absurd. 
Finally, it does give Congress the au-
thority and standing to go to the 
courts should the President violate the 
Constitution and the War Powers Act 
in the future—any President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H68 
January 9, 2020 
I have had problems with both Demo-
cratic and Republican Presidents over 
this issue over the years: Clinton, Bos-
nia; Bush, obviously in a number of 
cases; and then Obama in Libya and 
other things that they did, also based 
on the fake intelligence in the 2002 au-
thorization. 
So let’s first vote today. That is just 
a starting point in reasserting our con-
stitutional duties. 
f 
IRAN IS A TERROR STATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
as a terror state, Iran is no friend of 
the United States or our allies. For 
three decades, Iran has been a leading 
state sponsor of terrorism and an eager 
empire builder. Its history of money 
laundering, terrorism, and murder of 
U.S. soldiers is undeniable. 
Last week, the President, as Com-
mander in Chief, took the legal and de-
cisive action when he eliminated ter-
rorist 
combatant 
leader 
Qasem 
Soleimani from the battlefield. Across 
the years in the region, this man of 
murder has the blood of hundreds of 
thousands of innocents on his hands. 
To refer to this combat operation as 
an assassination or to offer moral 
equivalence between Soleimani and a 
state-sponsored 
terror 
organization 
with a rule-following nation actively 
engaged in the family of nations is 
laughable. 
In my view, Soleimani ranks up there 
with the worst exporters of terror in 
the region, including the likes of 
Osama bin Laden or al-Baghdadi, the 
most recent demised head of ISIS. 
Over these three decades, the United 
States and our allies have faced greater 
and more violent Iranian or Iranian 
proxy attacks orchestrated by the ter-
ror general Soleimani against the 
United States and our allies, dating as 
far back as 1983, when Iran’s proxy 
Hezbollah committed the Beirut, Leb-
anon, bombing, killing 241 marines. 
Soleimani, Iran, Hezbollah, and their 
thirst for violence is well documented 
and undeniable. In the face of this 
record and their very aggressive ac-
tions of the last few weeks, including 
the killing of an American contractor, 
targeting of U.S. forces, attacking 
Saudi Arabian oil operations, dis-
rupting shipping in the Persian Gulf, 
shooting down an American drone, and 
then blatantly and aggressively at-
tacking 
our 
Embassy in Baghdad, 
President Trump has been quite re-
strained during the course of that 
record. 
However, the killing of an American 
contractor 
and 
orchestrating 
that 
storming and destruction at the Amer-
ican Embassy in Baghdad and the emi-
nent planning of additional threats 
that this Congress learned the details 
of yesterday and attacks potentially on 
American troops or diplomats was the 
final straw. 
Mr. Speaker, the provocateur is Iran, 
not President Trump. The assassin is 
Soleimani, not President Trump. The 
destabilizing force in the region is Iran, 
not the United States. 
Yesterday, President Trump reiter-
ated that the United States does not 
seek to start a war with Iran. His re-
cent actions have sent an unambiguous 
signal to Iran and their proxies: Harm 
Americans, pay a price. 
President 
Trump’s 
objectives 
are 
clear: End Iran’s export of terror; end 
its advancing regional ballistic missile 
capabilities; and prohibit their obtain-
ing a nuclear weapon. 
Instead, President Trump encourages 
the Iranian people to assert their own 
aspirations and form a more open and 
pluralistic future for their children and 
their children’s children. This rich, his-
toric land deserves to return to a time 
when the beautiful, intelligent Iranian 
people chart their own course for good, 
as citizens of a country eager to be 
part of the family of nations. 
f 
SAY NO TO ANOTHER WAR IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the thousands 
of patriots who are taking to the 
streets of towns and cities throughout 
our Nation later today, taking to the 
streets to stand up, to speak out, and 
to say no to yet another war in the 
Middle East. 
Less than 48 hours ago, our Nation 
was gripped by fear as we watched mis-
siles rain down on our servicemembers 
and other allied forces in Iraq, an at-
tack that was a direct response to this 
administration’s reckless and impul-
sive decisions to assassinate a high- 
ranking military leader in Iran. 
Like so many of my colleagues, I 
prayed. I prayed for all of the service-
members and their families. I prayed 
for the innocent civilians in Iraq who 
once again find themselves in the 
crossfire in a battlefield of our own 
making. I prayed for peace. 
But I also know perfectly well that 
the people of the Massachusetts 7th did 
not send me to Washington, D.C., to 
just pray. As a woman of faith, I will 
continue to send prayers up and to 
work for peace. But what this moment 
demands and what this country de-
serves is a strategy. 
For more than 3 years now, this ad-
ministration has been devoid of a co-
herent approach, instead implementing 
our Nation’s foreign policy like a game 
of Battleship. They have actively in-
cited further conflict in the region, 
abandoned diplomacy, and isolated our 
country from even our strongest allies. 
The administration tore up the inter-
national agreement keeping Iran from 
developing nuclear weapons. The ad-
ministration then engaged in a max-
imum pressure campaign that has rav-
aged the Iranian economy and harmed 
innocent civilians. 
Yesterday, the White House had the 
opportunity to change course. Instead, 
we heard more of the same. 
Let me be clear: We cannot allow our 
country to be lied into another war. We 
have the opportunity to learn from the 
mistakes of our past. 
For nearly two decades, endless wars 
have claimed the lives of hundreds and 
thousands of civilians and servicemem-
bers alike. An entire generation has 
only known war. Millions of refugees 
have been permanently displaced. 
I remind my colleagues today that 
war is never inevitable. We reject the 
false choice between peace and secu-
rity. 
The 116th Congress is a fundamen-
tally different Congress, and it is time 
to advocate for a fundamentally dif-
ferent foreign policy: foreign policy 
centered in the dignity and humanity 
of all people. 
Prayers alone will not suffice. We 
need prayers and strategy. This is our 
chance. Let me be abundantly clear. 
The American people do not want war.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION DOES 
NOT 
LIMIT 
THE 
PRESIDENT’S 
POWER TO ACT WITHOUT CON-
GRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong opposition to a dangerous and 
partisan resolution offered by my Dem-
ocrat colleagues designed to handcuff 
our President and limit his constitu-
tional authorities as Commander in 
Chief to defend our Nation against Ira-
nian aggression. 
The resolution before us today need-
lessly politicizes our national security 
and shows that Democrats have once 
again put their partisan agenda ahead 
of the American people simply because 
they do not like President Trump. 
Let’s be clear. President Trump’s de-
cisive and defensive action to elimi-
nate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps Quds Force commander, Qasem 
Soleimani, is not the reason for the re-
cent escalation between the United 
States and Iran. The President ordered 
the strike because of Iran’s own esca-
lation and aggression, for which Gen-
eral Soleimani was largely and person-
ally responsible. 
For over 40 years, Iran and it proxies 
have been attacking U.S. interests and 
our allies, but since the flawed Iran nu-
clear deal, under which the regime re-
ceived billions of dollars in sanctions 
relief, the Islamic republic has used 
that economic windfall to accelerate 
its support for terrorist proxies, restart 
its ballistic missile program—in viola-
tion of U.N. resolutions—and cheat on 
its denuclearization aims. 
My colleagues have heard the quote 
of the late Senator Arthur Vandenberg,

H69 
January 9, 2020 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee that: ‘‘We must stop 
partisan politics at the water’s edge.’’ 
Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, 
who worked across the aisle with Dem-
ocrat President Truman in the early 
days of the Cold War was right. 
This resolution is not safeguarding 
our Constitution, but attacking our 
Constitution by attempting to divest a 
duly elected President of his Com-
mander in Chief powers, and in the 
process, emboldening our enemies. 
In fact, President Trump has dem-
onstrated enormous restraint in his 
targeted 
action 
against 
Soleimani 
making this vote entirely unnecessary. 
There was no invasion of Iran, but a 
strike against a terrorist in a country 
we had the legal authority to operate 
in under the 2002 Authorization for the 
Use of Military Force. 
Mr. Speaker, you have heard many of 
my colleagues doubt the applicability 
of that AUMF, so for those colleagues 
who are unconvinced that that is a suf-
ficient authority, consider the fact 
that even in the absence of explicit 
congressional authorization for the 
Soleimani strike, here is a helpful re-
minder: Article II, Section 2 of the 
Constitution provides that: The Presi-
dent shall be Commander in Chief. And 
it is true that the Constitution gives 
Congress the sole power to declare war 
and the sole power of the purse to ei-
ther fund or defund military action, 
but dating back to the Prize cases in 
1863, the Supreme Court has long held 
that the President may act without 
Congress to defend the Nation. 
In recent years, the Justice Depart-
ment’s Office of Legal Counsel has 
opined that the Constitution author-
izes the President as Commander in 
Chief to order military action without 
congressional permission if the Presi-
dent determines that the action would 
be anticipatory self-defense or other-
wise serves the interest of the United 
States, at least where the nature, 
scope, and duration of the anticipated 
hostilities are limited. 
And that was what was the case here. 
Specifically, the OLC has said the 
President’s inherent constitutional au-
thority as Commander in Chief, his 
broad foreign policy powers, and his 
duty to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed, empower him to 
deplore the armed forces abroad, with-
out a declaration of war by Congress or 
other congressional authorization. 
The courts have generally declined to 
review the exercise of such unilateral 
executive power. 
The War Powers Resolution does not 
limit the President’s power to act 
without Congress. At most, it imposes 
a reporting and consultation require-
ment that this President has complied 
with. 
Furthermore, the War Powers Reso-
lution applies only to the deployment 
of significant bodies of military per-
sonnel and would not apply to a drone 
strike. 
Finally, according to OLC, ‘‘ . . . if 
our Armed Forces otherwise lawfully 
stationed in a foreign country were 
fired upon and defended themselves, we 
doubt that such engagement in hos-
tilities would be covered by the con-
sultation and reporting provisions of 
the War Powers Resolution.’’ 
Of course, that is precisely the sce-
nario here involving the President’s de-
cisive strike against Soleimani in re-
sponse to an attack on our embassy. 
Thank goodness we have a Com-
mander in Chief who will not allow an-
other Benghazi on his watch. Don’t for-
get, the Framers of the Constitution 
specifically rejected a proposal that 
Congress 
be 
empowered 
to 
‘‘make 
war,’’ and implied power for the Presi-
dent to ‘‘repel sudden attacks.’’ 
This was in recognition of the slow 
pace and inefficiency of legislative pro-
ceedings under the Articles of Confed-
eration. As Members of Congress, we 
have a special duty to jealously guard 
legislative prerogatives, including the 
power to declare war, and to provide a 
check on the executive branch for over-
reach. But we also must have the hu-
mility to acknowledge that Congress 
lacks the power to divest the President 
of his Commander in Chief powers 
under Article II.

RECOGNIZING 
ASSISTANT 
CHIEF 
LAURA QUATTLEBAUM FOR HER 
YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE 
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, it is appro-
priate that on National Law Enforce-
ment Appreciation Day, I rise to recog-
nize California Highway Patrol Assist-
ant Division Chief Laura Quattlebaum 
for her years with the California High-
way Patrol and congratulate her on her 
retirement. 
Assistant Chief Quattlebaum is a 
shining example of the selflessness and 
courage our Nation’s law enforcement 
possesses. She is truly an amazing 
woman, full of passion, character, and 
integrity. 
I 
am 
humbled 
to 
have 
worked alongside her in our commu-
nity, and I am honored to call her my 
friend. 
For more than 30 years, Assistant 
Chief Quattlebaum has served as a 
dedicated public officer for my con-
stituents, as well as countless other 
Californians. After graduating from the 
CHP academy she went on to act as 
public information officer for the city 
of Indio. 
From this critical position to her 
current role as California Highway Pa-
trol assistant chief, she has answered 
the call to defend our public safety 
many times. Throughout her career, 
Assistant Chief Quattlebaum has been 
recognized on numerous occasions for 
her outstanding work. As lieutenant in 
the Indio area, she received the Com-
missioner’s Commendation for Leader-
ship and Cultural Awareness and Ra-
cial Profile training. 
Six years later, Assemblyman Brian 
Nestande awarded her the 2013 Women 
of Distinction award, and in 2014, As-
semblyman Manuel Perez presented her 
with the Woman of the Year award in 
recognition of her service to the people 
of California. 
Assistant 
Chief 
Quattlebaum 
is 
known to her colleagues as a hard-
working and selfless leader. Her com-
mitment to bettering the lives of oth-
ers is reflected in her tireless advocacy 
for those she served alongside and for 
peace officers throughout the country. 
I have witnessed this commitment 
firsthand on multiple occasions, nota-
bly, when we worked together to more 
than double our Nation’s funding for 
mental health services for our local 
law enforcement agencies just last 
year. 
Assistant Chief Quattlebaum’s career 
in public service is a true testament to 
her devotion to community, country, 
and public safety. Her unwavering dedi-
cation to the people of California is ad-
mirable. 
On behalf of California’s 36th Con-
gressional District, I thank Assistant 
Chief Quattlebaum for her years of 
service and thank all of our law en-
forcement agents who work tirelessly 
to uphold the safety of our commu-
nities. 
I 
congratulate 
Assistant 
Chief 
Quattlebaum on her retirement. We 
must carry the spirit of National Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day with us 
every day by showing our gratitude for 
our public safety officers year-round. 
CONFLICT WITH IRAN 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise on be-
half of Americans in my district and 
across the country who are anxious 
that the events of this past week are 
sending us down a path to war with 
Iran. 
Over the past week, I have been 
thinking most about our servicemem-
bers and their families, the people 
whose lives will be immediately and ir-
reversibly affected by the decision to 
go to war: sons, daughters, mothers, fa-
thers, siblings, our neighbors and our 
friends, who will put at risk their lives; 
families worried about their loved ones 
put in harm’s way; servicemembers 
who have seen multiple deployments 
and are now faced with the prospect of 
being sent overseas yet again. 
Our veterans and their families have 
dealt with the human toll of war for 
nearly 20 years. It is time for a new ap-
proach. Americans don’t want another 
endless war in the Middle East. After 19 
years of conflict, America doesn’t need 
another war. We do not want reckless, 
high-risk provocations of war that 
make Americans less safe for years to 
come. 
That is why I urge President Trump 
to deescalate the situation and pursue 
a diplomatic path forward. In the 
meantime, I hope everyone will join me 
in continuing to pray for the service-
members overseas defending our Na-
tion and for a strategic, peaceful solu-
tion to avoid another costly war in the 
Middle East.

STANDING IN FIRM SUPPORT OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON HIS AC-
TIONS AGAINST TERRORISTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to stand in firm support of President 
Trump’s leadership in his decisive ac-
tions against evil terrorists. 
America and the world are safer 
without Qasem Soleimani. Not only is 
America safer, it is more prosperous 
than ever before and now energy inde-
pendent. 
The Iranian regime would be wise to 
not further test this President’s mettle 
and the overwhelming capabilities of 
the greatest fighting force the world 
has ever known: our U.S. military. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GENERAL PAUL KELLEY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of General P.X. 
Kelley. General Kelley was the embodi-
ment of the Marine Corps. His distin-
guished record inspired me, the ma-
rines with whom I served, and will con-
tinue to inspire marines for genera-
tions to come. 
In Vietnam, General Kelley earned 
the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit 
with Valor, and two Bronze Stars with 
Valor. 
As commandant, he led the Corps 
during the dark days following the 1983 
Iran-backed bombing of the Marine 
Corps barracks in Beirut. General 
Kelley’s leadership inspired every ma-
rine to hold true to the values of the 
Corps. I am terribly saddened by the 
passing of General Kelley, but I will be 
forever grateful of serving under his 
command. 
Semper fi. 
CONGRATULATING
GATORADE
INDIANA
FOOT-
BALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR CHARLIE SPEGAL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate an exemplary student- 
athlete, Charlie Spegal. 
Charlie 
was 
recently 
named 
the 
Gatorade Indiana Football Player of 
the Year. He has had an outstanding 
football career, holding the all-time 
State career record in rushing yards, 
rushing touchdowns, and career touch-
downs. 
Finishing with 10,867 career rushing 
yards and 175 touchdowns, he did this 
while maintaining above a 3.5 GPA. 
Charlie has been a role model for stu-
dent athletes everywhere. 
I congratulate Charlie on his wonder-
ful career throughout high school and 
wish him the best of luck in college. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF AMERICAN HERO 
CHARLES ‘‘RED’’ WHITTINGTON 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker I rise today 
to remember the life of American Hero 
Charles ‘‘Red’’ Whittington. 
Red served in France during World 
War II as a member of the 377th Infan-
try Regiment and the 95th Infantry Di-
vision. 
His regiment was given the nickname 
‘‘Iron Men of Metz’’ for their fierce lib-
eration in defense of the town of Metz 
from German counterattacks. 
Whittington was the recipient of a 
Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, the 
Combat Infantryman Badge, the Euro-
pean Theater of Operations Campaign 
Medal with two battle stars, a Good 
Conduct medal and the Victory Medal. 
I give my deepest condolences to the 
Whittington family and hope they find 
comfort 
in 
knowing 
that 
Charles 
‘‘Red’’ Whittington was a true Amer-
ican hero. 
CONGRATULATING SOUTH DEARBORN HIGH 
SCHOOL ON REIMPLEMENTING FFA AG PROGRAM 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate 
South 
Dearborn 
High 
School for reimplementing their FFA 
Ag program. FFA educates students on 
agricultural success, as well as pro-
viding hands-on career training experi-
ence. 
After a 30-year absence, students and 
future farmers at South Dearborn will 
again be able to gain the knowledge 
and experience they need to succeed in 
the agriculture industry. 
Congratulations to South Dearborn 
FFA, and I look forward to seeing your 
chapter grow.

PRESIDENT NEEDS TO MAKE THE 
CASE FOR MILITARY ACTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, young 
men and women enlisting in our mili-
tary for the first time will enter re-
cruitment offices across our country 
this year. 
On their IDs will be birth dates that 
reflect the fact that they are signing 
up to fight in wars that started before 
they were born. 
Nineteen years. That is how long we 
have been in Afghanistan. Seventeen 
years. That is how long we have been 
in Iraq. Not to mention the American 
weapons, the American dollars, the 
American boots, the American lives 
that have been sent to Yemen, Syria, 
Somalia, and many, many other cor-
ners of our globe. 
b 1030 
We are a generation that has spent 
the better part of its life at war in a 
country in the Middle East, perpetual 
wars fought under the cover of two per-
mission slips that this body gave the 
executive branch nearly 20 years ago. 
In 2001, Congress authorized our of-
fensive 
against 
al-Qaida 
and 
the 
Taliban in the wake of 9/11 in what be-
came the largest armed conflict in 
American history. In 2002, Congress au-
thorized the invasion of Iraq, and it be-
came the greatest foreign policy mis-
take of a generation. 
And our response has been silence, si-
lence from this collective body; silence 
as we have sent hundreds of thousands 
of American men and women to Af-
ghanistan and tens of thousands more 
to Iraq; silence as three administra-
tions, 
Democratic 
and 
Republican, 
have used these two authorizations to 
expand, to evolve, to justify, and to 
prolong our presence in a volatile and 
violent region; and silence as our role 
has become less clear and our mission 
less certain. 
What we have lost in this silence is 
hard to quantify—the lives that could 
have been spared, the families we could 
have protected, the money we could 
have used to do good, and the credi-
bility we could have saved if we had 
summoned the collective courage to 
tear up those permission slips. 
The vote today on the War Powers 
Resolution to restrict the current ad-
ministration’s actions against Iran is 
an important one. It is a necessary re-
sponse to a reckless President without 
a plan. But it is not enough because, 
yesterday, this administration told us 
that the legal authority to launch a 
strike targeting Iran 6 days ago was 
granted based on the authority that 
this body allowed to invade Iraq 18 
years ago, using a deceased dictator to 
justify a potential war against an en-
tirely different adversary, making a 
mockery of matters of war and peace. 
So now, facing the threat of war with 
a different yet brutal regime, this body 
must finally act to cut off any avenue 
that this President or any other Presi-
dent has to enter our people into a war 
that we do not want because this isn’t 
just about the actions of a current ad-
ministration. It is about the precedent 
that we set from this day forward. 
We must pass a War Powers Resolu-
tion today. We must repeal the 2001 and 
2002 Authorization for Use of Military 
Force. We must compel the executive 
branch to come to Congress and make 
the case that any military action that 
is required to protect American lives is 
in our best interests and justified. 
And we in Congress must be prepared 
to take some tough votes because that 
is our job. It is the very least that we 
owe our men and women in uniform 
putting their lives on the line so the 
rest of us might sleep safe and free.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN MI-
CHAEL FITZPATRICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember 
and honor my friend and former col-
league, Michael Fitzpatrick. Former 
Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick passed 
away on January 6 after a 12-year bat-
tle with cancer. 
He served as chairman of the House 
Committee on Financial Services’ Task 
Force to Investigate Terrorism Financ-
ing. Over a 2-year period, the task force 
investigated the financial mechanisms 
used to fund terrorist activities. 
Mike was a leading voice in Congress 
on medical device safety, pressing the 
FDA after dangerous medical devices 
remained in use after causing serious 
injury and death. He was an Eagle

Scout from the Bucks County Council 
and former president of that council 
and was honored with the Silver Bea-
ver Award for his service to scouting. 
Mike retired in 2017 and was consist-
ently ranked among the most bipar-
tisan Members of Congress. 
I lift my prayers for Mike’s wife, 
Kathleen; their six children; his broth-
er, Congressman BRIAN
FITZPATRICK; 
and the Fitzpatrick family during this 
difficult time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is also appropriate to 
celebrate the tremendous accomplish-
ments 
and 
difference 
Congressman 
Mike Fitzpatrick made in a relatively 
short life. 
Well done, my friend. Rest in God’s 
loving arms. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
THOMPSON) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to honor the 
life and the accomplishments of Con-
gressman Mike Fitzpatrick. He was a 
great and trusted colleague. More im-
portantly, he was a good friend, and he 
was my friend. 
He didn’t seek the spotlight; he just 
sought to do the right thing. 
He was all about representing his dis-
trict. Representing his district put him 
at odds, oftentimes, with popular senti-
ment around here, but Mike wasn’t 
bothered by any of that. He was true to 
his convictions; he was true to his fam-
ily; and he was true to his friends. 
Guys like Mike Fitzpatrick who 
come here, serve, and stay focused on 
what is important and stay true are 
hard to find and even harder to replace. 
We wish God’s blessing on Mike 
Fitzpatrick and his entire family. We 
pray the Lord will fill the intolerable 
emptiness of his passing. 
I would just like to say: We miss you, 
Mike Fitzpatrick, and Godspeed. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I as well 
rise today to pay tribute to our friend, 
the Honorable Michael G. Fitzpatrick, 
a longtime Republican who served as a 
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, commis-
sioner and served as a Member of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives, who, sadly, passed away Monday, 
January 6. 
Mike was the oldest son of eight chil-
dren, born on June 28, 1963, in Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania. He grew up and re-
sided in Bucks County. Mike was an 
Eagle Scout, an Eagles fan, and a grad-
uate of Dickinson Law School. 
Those who knew Mike said the same 
thing: He worked hard every day to 
make his constituents’ lives better. 
First elected to Congress in 2004, he 
served four terms and then stepped 
down, honoring his self-imposed pledge 
to term limits. Mike’s brother, BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, succeeded his older broth-
er and continues to serve their home 
district honorably. BRIAN is a great 
Member and a friend to us all. 
Mike was described by a friend as a 
classic Bucks County Irishman and a 
man whose family always came first. 
Congressman BRIAN FITZPATRICK and 
the entire Fitzpatrick family appre-
ciate our prayers. Mike is survived by, 
in addition to his brother BRIAN, his six 
other brothers and sisters; his parents, 
James and Mary; a grandson; a grand-
daughter; his wife of 31 years, Kath-
leen; and their six children. 
I thank you for your work to make 
Pennsylvania and our country a better 
place, Congressman Fitzpatrick. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and the legacy of former Pennsylvania 
Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick. 
Mike was a dedicated public servant 
who proudly represented the people of 
Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional 
District, showcasing incredible courage 
not only in Congress but throughout 
his life. 
This 
week, 
former 
Congressman 
Fitzpatrick passed away after a valiant 
battle with metastatic melanoma. As a 
dermatologist, I have witnessed this 
disease claim many lives and devastate 
too many families. Here in Congress, it 
is my privilege to serve as co-chair of 
the Skin Cancer Caucus, and I remain 
dedicated 
to 
promoting 
innovative 
treatments and cures for melanoma. 
On behalf of the 13th District of 
Pennsylvania, I am grateful to Con-
gressman Mike Fitzpatrick for his 
longstanding service to our Common-
wealth and to our entire Nation. 
As we honor him today, I extend my 
sincere 
sympathies 
to 
the 
entire 
Fitzpatrick 
family, 
including 
my 
friend, 
Congressman 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, upon the loss of a great 
leader from Pennsylvania and a great 
leader in our Nation. 
f 
RELEASE FUNDS FOR PUERTO 
RICO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday morning, southwest Puerto 
Rico was struck by a 6.4 magnitude 
earthquake. 
That seismic event followed hundreds 
of smaller quakes that had rattled the 
region since December 28. However, 
Tuesday’s quake inflicted enormous 
damage, causing a school to collapse, 
killing at least one person, and leaving 
almost 
the 
entire 
island 
without 
power. 
Indeed, today, Puerto Rico’s largest 
power generation facility, Costa Sur, 
remains offline as we speak. That 
power plant is responsible for 40 per-
cent of electricity generation on the is-
land. Even as of last night, more than 
two-thirds of Puerto Ricans had no 
electricity. 
Mr. Speaker, 250,000 Puerto Ricans 
were without water. Hundreds of homes 
were damaged. As of last night, more 
than 5,200 Puerto Ricans were sleeping 
on the street, afraid their homes could 
collapse on them. 
For the people of Puerto Rico, this 
natural disaster evokes dark memories 
seared in our minds of how this admin-
istration and the Federal Government 
failed, turning a natural disaster into a 
humanitarian crisis. 
In 2017, because of this administra-
tion’s incompetence and indifference, 
the Puerto Rican people suffered im-
mensely. They endured the longest 
blackout in American history, and 3,000 
of our fellow citizens lost their lives. 
We cannot afford to repeat those mis-
takes. 
Sadly, today, this administration’s 
disdain for the people of Puerto Rico 
remains on full display, this time in 
the form of previously approved funds 
that it is withholding. In response to 
Hurricanes Maria and Irma, Congress 
passed $8.3 billion in HUD relief and 
mitigation 
funding, 
resources 
that 
HUD to this day refuses to release. Let 
me repeat that: The Secretary of HUD 
is violating the law, scoffing at con-
gressional intent, and blocking the 
people of Puerto Rico from receiving 
previously approved disaster funds. 
This comes even after another disaster 
has stricken the island. 
We do not know yet how bad the dev-
astation from this earthquake will be. 
We also do not know if there will be 
yet more earthquakes. But this is cer-
tain: It is unacceptable, especially now, 
for Secretary Carson and HUD to stand 
in the way of Puerto Rico’s receiving 
previously allocated assistance. It is 
also illegal. 
Mr. Speaker, these are our fellow 
citizens. They deserve our compassion 
and our assistance. When wildfires or 
earthquakes hit California or hurri-
canes strike Texas, Americans stand 
together and assist one another. They 
give each other the helping hand that 
they deserve. But when it comes to 
Puerto Rico, this administration in-
stead chooses to stand in the way, to 
block necessary aid, and to put lives at 
risk. 
Mr. Speaker, if these funds are not 
released and if Puerto Rican people 
perish in the aftermath of this earth-
quake, then I have to say that it will 
be the U.S. Federal Government that is 
responsible. 
We cannot afford further delay. HUD 
must release these funds immediately, 
and FEMA must get to work, helping 
Puerto Rico recover from the latest ca-
tastrophe.

longtime position as the executive di-
rector of the Nebraska Press Associa-
tion after having been Nebraska’s sec-
retary of state for 24 years. 
Through his 48 years of public serv-
ice, Allen has been an example of dig-
nity and a source of inspiration to 
countless Nebraskans. Allen is well 
known 
across 
Nebraska 
and 
even 
around the world for his commitment 
to his work and his affinity for meeting 
new people. 
b 1045 
As a Nebraska Secretary of State, he 
worked tirelessly to protect the integ-
rity of our elections. He brought this 
commitment to integrity with him 
into his next role as executive director 
of the Nebraska Press Association as 
well. 
He has traveled to many countries 
and met with people from all walks of 
life, establishing relationships with ev-
eryone he meets along the way. Allen 
likes to say his career took him to ‘‘48 
countries in 48 years,’’ and I am sure he 
has no shortage of stories from these 
trips. 
I have known Allen for many years, 
and I can say, in addition to his hard 
work, Allen has always been a great 
person to be around. Allen is always 
one to lighten a conversation with his 
quick wit and positive attitude, and his 
many friends around the world are a 
testament to his character. He has 
even been known to poke fun at him-
self a little bit, stating, recently, that 
the Nebraska Historical Society has 
recognized him as the ‘‘official State 
artifact.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring Mr. Allen Beermann’s commend-
able public service, and wish him good 
luck in his retirement.

A TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL 
FITZPATRICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I speak from the 
heart about someone who was not just 
a colleague but a good friend. We heard 
some of my Republican colleagues, also 
from Pennsylvania, speaking about 
Mike Fitzpatrick earlier. 
I had the privilege to say that I was 
Mike’s constituent for a few years. 
Under the old, old lines in Pennsyl-
vania, he represented a portion of 
Philadelphia in the far northeast, 
where I reside. He and I became friends 
when I was a State representative and 
he was my Congressman. 
We quickly realized we had so much 
in common: similar sort of families, 
both born in Philadelphia, both proud 
Irish American families, both went to 
Catholic high school—Mike went to 
Bishop Egan, now Conwell-Egan; I went 
to Cardinal Dougherty. So it was not 
exactly difficult for the two of us to 
get along and to work so well together, 
especially when I would become a 
Member of Congress and he imme-
diately reached out to me and helped in 
any way he could. 
As colleagues, we worked well to-
gether on a whole host of issues. Our 
districts shared the entire Philadel-
phia-Bucks County border and then 
much of the Montgomery County- 
Bucks border as well. 
When I think of Mike, though, it is 
not so much the water safety issues 
and PFOS that we worked on or trans-
portation or so many issues that affect 
northeast Philadelphia, Bucks County- 
Montgomery 
County. 
What 
really 
strikes me is just what a nice and de-
cent person Mike was and his basic 
human decency. You see those same 
traits in his brother, now our col-
league, BRIAN. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I am deep in mourn-
ing today for Mike, his wife, Kathleen, 
his six children, Mike’s parents, includ-
ing his father, whom I had the oppor-
tunity to spend time with and meet 
this summer. My heart breaks for the 
Fitzpatrick family, but I hope that 
they can take solace in the fact that 
Mike left his mark on this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, to also speak about the 
life of Mike Fitzpatrick, I yield to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BOYLE. 
Frankly, it is my honor and privilege 
to join the Pennsylvania delegation as 
they honor their friend and mine, Con-
gressman Mike Fitzpatrick. 
Mr. Speaker, Congressman BOYLE 
would appreciate this. I had never 
heard of Bucks County until I came to 
Congress, but I learned of it quickly be-
cause of a young Congressman named 
Mike Fitzpatrick, who consistently 
talked about his home, his relationship 
with the people whom he served, whom 
he loved, whom he was devoted to. 
The gentleman gave some beautiful, 
generous comments about the nature 
of his character: He was devoted to his 
family; he was a man of high principle; 
he was personable. I think it is impor-
tant to point out as well: The gen-
tleman is a Democrat; he was a Repub-
lican; I am a Republican. And here we 
are, talking about things that actually 
unite us because of the character of 
people, good Americans like Mike 
Fitzpatrick, who looked for a way to be 
in authentic dialogue—while standing 
on his principles. He was a fighter, as 
well, but looked for a way to be in au-
thentic dialogue, even with people he 
might have a disagreement with. 
He was my friend. I remember in that 
corner back there, we had a very inti-
mate conversation one day of how he 
was facing a true dilemma because 
there was a vote that was about to be 
taken, for which he said, ‘‘This may 
cost me my election.’’ He took that 
vote anyway, and it did cost him the 
election, but then he came back and 
joined us again. 
Mr. Speaker, let me join with Con-
gressman BOYLE and the entire Penn-
sylvania delegation in expressing my 
condolences to Kathleen and his six 
kids, whom he talked about and whom 
we got to know as well. 
Being from Nebraska, again, I am a 
long way from Bucks County, but 
learned a great deal about the gentle-
man’s home and, of course, the deep 
character and the place that formed 
this wonderful public servant, Mike 
Fitzpatrick. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
EVANS). 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I, too, as 
all of my colleagues, not just Penn-
sylvanians, but all the others, stand up 
to speak about a young man, because 
he was a young man, Congressman Mi-
chael Fitzpatrick. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remem-
ber him not as just a departed col-
league from the great Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, but he was also a good 
person. He was someone whom I knew 
from the fact that, when I was in the 
State legislature and he was a Con-
gressman, that although I was not in 
his congressional district, I knew him 
very much as a person. I knew his lead-
ership; I knew what he provided; and I 
knew his friendliness. 
He, both, was a principled conserv-
ative and comfortable working with 
people on both sides of the aisle. That 
is how he got things done, including 
the creation of the Washington Cross-
ing National Cemetery. 
He also led the effort to better secure 
passenger planes from terrorism, a 
cause inspired by September 11 fami-
lies from Bucks County. 
Bucks County was very close to the 
congressional district in the legislative 
district I represented. Limekiln Pike is 
something that led up directly to 
Bucks County. So Mike was not a 
stranger to the issues in the southeast 
part of Pennsylvania, as well as the 
city of Philadelphia, as well as the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
My fellow Democrats from this dis-
trict all remember him as a true pa-
triot, a father to Bucks County, a man 
of grace and honor who looked past 
politics in the community. 
There is a quote from my departed 
colleague, and this is what he said: 
‘‘Some legislators look back at how 
many bills they passed. I measure my 
time by how many people I helped.’’ 
That was a quote that Mike has stat-
ed, and I think it is important if all of 
us remember this. So, in that spirit, we 
from Pennsylvania stand with that 
spirit of Michael Fitzpatrick. It is safe 
to say he helped a lot of people. 
Mr. Speaker, to BRIAN and his family, 
please know that you are in our pray-
ers and our thoughts. We don’t take 
that lightly. We understand it. I say to 
you that I am honored to be a part of 
the delegation of people who are stand-
ing here today to add my voice to the 
importance 
of 
what 
Michael 
Fitzpatrick meant to this body and to 
this country, and I thank him.

H73 
January 9, 2020 
IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL 
FITZPATRICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to, as well, today, pay tribute to Mi-
chael Gerard Fitzpatrick, who, as has 
been mentioned, served in this House, 
representing Pennsylvania’s Fifth Con-
gressional District. 
It was a privilege to serve with Mike, 
and, from the first time that I met 
Mike here in Washington in the House, 
I knew he was a man of character and 
a man of principle. 
Mr. Speaker, I think you have heard 
from the words that were spoken this 
morning before I spoke that, indeed, 
was the reputation that he had here in 
Washington, D.C., as I am sure he had 
back in the State of Pennsylvania. 
Today, as we pay tribute to Michael 
and his life, I am reminded, with just 
the passing of my own mother-in-law 
at 5 o’clock this morning, Shirley 
McDonald from Huntsville, Alabama, 
who was struggling from Parkinson’s 
disease, of just how short life is. Lit-
erally, I am reminded of the shortness 
of time and the greatness of eternity. 
But my mother-in-law, Shirley, and 
Michael knew that there is a life be-
yond this one and that, because of 
Christ, we can have hope to enter an 
eternal life. 
f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF GREG KIRK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Georgia State Senator Greg Kirk, who 
passed away on December 22 at the age 
of 56 after a battle with cancer. 
A former pastor, Senator Kirk was 
first elected to the State senate in 2014. 
Representing Americus in southwest 
Georgia, he spent his 6 years in the 
State senate working hard for rural 
Georgians: spurring job creation, pro-
tecting life, and always putting God 
first. 
His colleagues in the State senate re-
member him as an exceptional public 
servant who was always a champion for 
doing what is right, making him one of 
the State’s most fervent and gracious 
leaders. 
One of his most important pieces of 
legislation included a bill that would 
legally protect people who broke into a 
vehicle to help rescue a child that had 
been left unattended in hot weather. 
His presence, leadership, and passion 
for service will be dearly missed in the 
Georgia State senate. Senator Kirk’s 
family and friends will be in my 
thoughts and prayers during this most 
difficult time. 
IN RECOGNITION OF INTERNATIONAL SEAFARERS’ 
CENTER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Inter-
national Seafarers’ Center in Bruns-
wick, Georgia, for all of their work 
throughout the First Congressional 
District of Georgia. 
Operating in coastal Georgia for the 
last 38 years, the International Sea-
farers’ Center strives to provide spir-
itual, emotional, physical, and mate-
rial 
support 
to 
mariners 
passing 
through our area. Currently, the Port 
of Brunswick, alone, receives 16,000 sea-
farers annually who have very little ac-
cess to the conveniences of home while 
they are at sea. 
The International Seafarers’ Center 
is guided by its Christian faith, and 
with their two hospitality centers, 
they have done an exceptional job of 
serving those mariners from all walks 
of life, different religions, countless 
languages, and diverse races. 
One of the most notable examples of 
their work includes their effort to pro-
vide clothing and food to 20 crew mem-
bers of the Golden Ray cargo ship that 
had capsized off the coast of St. Si-
mon’s Island in September of 2019. 
I cannot thank everyone involved 
with the International Seafarers’ Cen-
ter enough for making the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia such a 
welcoming place for seafarers to pass 
through during their time at sea. 
Keep up the good work.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF BETTY GILLIS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Betty 
Gillis, who is retiring after 41 years 
serving as supervisor of Ware County’s 
Board of Elections and Registration. 
Throughout the past 4 decades, Ms. 
Gillis has done an exceptional job in 
the First Congressional District, ensur-
ing that Ware County’s elections are 
both robust and fair. 
Looking back on her time, she re-
members that she has enjoyed every 
minute of it, and she has come to think 
of her colleagues as extended family. 
In her retirement, Ms. Gillis is plan-
ning to spend more time with her fam-
ily. However, it will simply be impos-
sible to replace a public servant as 
dedicated and excited about her role as 
Ms. Gillis. 
Thank you for your service to the 
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia, Ms. Gillis. Congratulations on a re-
tirement well-deserved. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF CLAIR 
WOFFORD FRAZIER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Ms. Clair Wofford Frazier, who passed 
away on December 23, 2019, at the age 
of 58, after a battle with cancer. 
Ms. Wofford Frazier dedicated her 
life to serving her alma mater, Young 
Harris College. A member of the Board 
of Trustees for over a decade, she 
served on a number of different com-
mittees that impacted daily campus 
life, including committees on academic 
affairs, development, and student af-
fairs. 
She also created the Wofford-Frazier 
scholarship to help a Young Harris edu-
cation be as accessible as possible for 
deserving students. A testament to her 
work, the executive board room at the 
college is named in her honor, and she 
won the Susan B. Harris Award from 
the Alumni Association in 2008. 
Similar to her generosity with the 
college, those who knew her remember 
that Ms. Wofford Frazier was always 
the first person to offer help to some-
one in need. 
My thoughts and prayers will be with 
Ms. Wofford Frazier’s family during 
this most difficult time.

The recess having expired, the House

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, Lord of us all, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
You, O Lord, are the source of life 
and love. You hear the prayer of Con-
gress, both for the good of this Nation 
and for the good of humanity around 
the world. Help this Congress and the 
President to discern your will in our 
day. 
May short-term gains, self-interest, 
or partisan advantage never prove to 
be an obstacle to true vision. Rather, 
Lord, grant to each member depth of 
perception, clear analysis, and creative 
response to the needs of our time. 
Today we especially remember our 
fellow citizens in Puerto Rico as they 
recover from yet another natural dis-
aster. Bless them, and especially those 
who labor, sometimes dangerously, to 
help in the long return to normalcy on 
that beleaguered island. 
In these days give wisdom to all 
Members. And may all that is done be 
for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise for a parliamentary inquiry or a 
series thereof. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, am 
I correct that H. Res. 755 was passed by 
vote of the House on December 18, 2019? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will not verify the status of a 
measure not currently pending. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. A measure not cur-
rently pending. 
Additional 
parliamentary 
inquiry, 
please. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since H. Res. 755 passed on December 
18, 2019, and the motion to reconsider 
H. Res. 755 was laid on the table on 
that same date, December 18, 2019, is 
there any action the House of Rep-
resentatives can now take on H. Res. 
755? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair does not respond to hypothetical 
questions. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. It is not a hypo-
thetical. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair does not respond to hypothetical 
questions. 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Additional 
par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. I am not inquiring 
hypothetically. I may wish to take ac-
tion. Is there any action currently 
available to a Member of the House in 
regard to H. Res. 755? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair does not issue advisory opinions. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. All right. Further 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Is H. Res. 755 cur-
rently within the bosom of the U.S. 
House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is inquiring about the status of 
a measure not currently pending on the 
House floor. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. I thank the Speaker. 
Additional parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Since 21 calendar 
days, 12 working days, and seven legis-
lative days have gone by since H. Res. 
755 passed the House and the Speaker 
of the House has not been physically 
able to deliver H. Res. 755 to the United 
States Senate, does clause 8(b)(3)(C) of 
rule I of the House rules automatically 
cause a vacancy in the Office of the 
Speaker, or what action does the House 
need to take since the Speaker has not 
been able to physically do an essential 
part of her administrative duties as the 
Speaker of the House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has stated the form of clause 
8(b)(3) of rule I. However, the gen-
tleman is not stating a parliamentary 
question within the purview of the 
Chair at this point. The gentleman is 
free to consult the rule and its accom-
panying legislative history for further 
clarification. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. I thank the Chair. 
Additional parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Reviewing its par-
liamentary history, I would ask the 
Chair, is there any precedent, other 
than incapacity, of a Speaker not time-
ly transmitting action of the House to 
the United States Senate? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will not issue an advisory opin-
ion. The Chair is prepared to entertain 
one more parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Additional 
par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
clause 8(b)(3)(C) says that a physical 
incapacity to do the job of Speaker 
causes or may cause a vacancy. I am 
asking if there is any precedent related 
to that rule that the Chair can direct 
me to, having found none on my own? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will again respond that she will 
not issue an advisory opinion. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. I respectfully dis-
agree that it is an advisory opinion and 
thank the Chair for her indulgence.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
TAKE ACTION ON PFAS 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I come to the well of the 
House today to call on my colleagues 
to support the PFAS Action Act. This 
bill, like so many that have come to 
the floor under Democratic leadership, 
is about taking action for the people; 
in this case, ensuring access to clean 
and safe water. 
PFAS, so-called forever chemicals 
that have leached into water supplies 
for decades, are hazardous to human 
health. Their presence is linked with 
reduced kidney function, reduced im-
mune system function, and increased 
risk for diseases like diabetes and can-
cer. 
These chemicals are in our water be-
cause of corporate negligence, and like 
in many other cases, our working fami-
lies trying to make ends meet are hit 
the hardest. That is why it is critical 
that Congress step up and take action, 
and that is why this legislation is so 
important and what it is about. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand up for the people and 
vote for the PFAS Action Act.

FORT JACKSON EXPANSION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the 
addition of the Civil Affairs and Psy-
chological Operations Advanced Indi-
vidual Training courses at Fort Jack-
son, South Carolina, which is one of 
the most military friendly commu-
nities in America. 
Civil affairs and psychological oper-
ation soldiers bring unique skill sets. 
The relocation of Fort Jackson, where 
over half of all soldiers attend basic 
training, effectively organizes courses 
in the Army Training and Doctrine 
Command environment. 
Through job growth at Fort Jackson, 
the local economy of Columbia will 
benefit with nearly $5 million in initial 
establishment, and $3.5 annually. 
Congratulations 
to 
Commanding 
General Milford Beagle, Jr., of Fort 
Jackson on this expansion. I appreciate 
his extraordinary leadership. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th, defeating terrorists overseas, in 
the global war on terrorism with the 
courageous 
leadership 
of 
President 
Donald Trump. 
Our sympathy goes out to the family 
of Nawres Hamid, an Iraqi American 
Muslim from California who was mur-
dered by the Soleimani-financed ter-
rorists on December 27.

for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise this morning to congratulate a 
very 
significant 
and 
historic 
high 
school, Jack Yates High School. Jack 
Yates High School was founded by the 
founding father, if you will, of the Afri-
can American community in Houston, 
Freedmen’s Town. 
He is the founder of Wheeler Avenue 
Baptist Church. He is respected at 
Texas Southern University, and today 
they announced in a public school that 
they will implement an international 
baccalaureate. 
In the midst of the tumultuous times 
that we have, how important it is that 
high school students will be engaged in 
discussions of peace, diplomacy, under-
standing world engagement, under-
standing the value of languages and 
being diverse, recognizing the wonder-
ful experiment of the United States 
founded by those who fled persecution 
and indicated in the Constitution we 
have organized to create a more perfect 
union. 
The more young people, more minori-
ties that we can get in programs like 
an international baccalaureate where 
they will come out with that document 
and be ready to perch on the leadership 
role is outstanding. 
To Jack Yates High School, I salute 
you. You are mighty. You are impor-
tant, and God bless you.

CELEBRATING KELLY’S ANGELS 
ON THEIR 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and celebrate 
Kelly’s Angels on their 10-year anniver-
sary. This charitable organization has 
been serving the children of the Capital 
Region of New York for the past dec-
ade. 
After 
Kelly 
Mulholland, 
a 
local 
teacher and mother of two from my 
district, tragically lost her battle with 
cancer in 2007 at the age of 37, her hus-
band, Mark, founded Kelly’s Angels in 
her honor. 
Their mission is to provide grants for 
children in upstate New York who have 
lost parents or siblings to cancer or 
other illnesses. Children receive fund 
grants to use for whatever the child 
can dream up. 
The goal of these grants is to bring a 
smile to a child’s face, create positive 
new memories, and help with the heal-
ing process. 
Kelly’s 
Angels 
has 
worked 
with 
countless families in our local commu-
nities over the past decade, and their 
work continues to have a positive im-
pact on so many lives. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I want to congratu-
late and thank Mark, his children, 
McKenna and Connor, and the entire 
Kelly’s Angels team for achieving this 
milestone. 
I thank them for their amazing work. 
We are so proud of them. 
f 
STOP TRUMP’S WAR WITH IRAN 
(Ms. GABBARD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
GABBARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Trump has committed an il-
legal and unconstitutional act of war, 
pushing our Nation headlong into a 
war with Iran without any authoriza-
tion from Congress, a war that would 
be so costly and devastating, it would 
make our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
look like a picnic. 
In doing so, he has undermined our 
national security in two critical ways: 
number one, Iran is no longer com-
plying with the Iran nuclear agreement 
and is quickly speeding forward in de-
veloping their nuclear weapons capa-
bility, putting us and the world at 
greater risk. 
Number two, our troops in Iraq are 
no longer focusing on preventing a re-
surgence of ISIS and al-Qaida. Instead, 
all of their efforts are now focused on 
Iranian forces and Iranian-backed Shia 
militias. 
Congress must act today to stop fur-
ther escalation of this war. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H. Con. Res. 83 to uphold the Con-
stitution which we all took an oath to 
support. Vote ‘‘yes’’ to stop Trump’s 
war with Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

HIGHLIGHTING SERVICE ACADEMY 
NOMINATION BOARD 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight one of the most re-
warding responsibilities I have as a 
Member of Congress: the honor of 
nominating students to the service 
academies. 
This past weekend, I met with my 
Service Academy Nomination Board 
for North Carolina’s 13th Congressional 
District to begin the review process. 
This year’s board includes Mr. Ronald 
Hope of Advance, Mr. Matt Reyes of 
Mooresville, Mr. Doug Lain of High 
Point, Mrs. Rayne Brown of Lexington, 
Mr. Wayne Davidson of Greensboro, 
Mr. John Sherden of Mocksville, and 
Mr. Frank Pugh of Greensboro. 
I am grateful that these individuals 
sacrificed their time and effort to help 
review 
applications, 
interview 
can-
didates, and recommend qualified indi-
viduals for the nominations. I look for-
ward to announcing our nominees in 
the coming weeks. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
thanking the members of our board and 
all the applicants who want to serve 
our great country. 
PREVENTING WAR WITH IRAN 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I am 
here to condemn the President’s hos-
tile actions against Iran that led us to 
the brink of war. 
President Trump had no legal jus-
tification to launch an attack against 
Iran. The President’s dangerous provo-
cation was unlawful and unconstitu-
tional, and Congress must assert its 
sole authority to declare war. His ac-
tions made America less safe. 
Today, I will be voting for a War 
Powers Resolution to check the Presi-
dent’s use of military action against 
Iran. But the need for Congress to re-
assert its authority does not end there. 
We must repeal the 2002 AUMF and pre-
vent the administration from engaging 
in an unauthorized war by restricting 
funding from being used to wage war 
against Iran. 
We must not yield to the voices of ex-
treme hawks that see war as the only 
answer. We must not go to war with 
Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

RECOGNIZING U.S. ASTRONAUT 
CHRISTINA KOCH 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, as a North Carolinian 
and member of the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee, I take great 
joy today in rising to recognize United 
States astronaut Christina Koch. 
Christina grew up in eastern North 
Carolina in Jacksonville and graduated 
from the prestigious North Carolina 
School of Science and Mathematics. 
She later earned her bachelor’s and 
master’s degrees from N.C. State. 
On December 28, 2019, Christina set 
the record for the longest continuous 
spaceflight by a female. She surpassed 
the 
previous 
record 
of 
288 
days 
achieved by fellow astronaut Peggy 
Whitson. She is now at 300 days and 
counting. In addition, Christina par-
ticipated in the first all-female space 
walk on October 18 alongside fellow as-
tronaut Jessica Meir. 
She is, without a doubt, one of the 
most accomplished people in North 
Carolina’s history. Christina has made 
her country, her State, and all of east-
ern North Carolina proud. I wish her 
luck 
on 
her 
continuous 
voyage 
amongst the stars. We look forward to 
her safe return to Earth in February.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H76 
January 9, 2020 
Ms. 
BROWNLEY 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of my bill, the Women Veterans 
TRUST Act, a bill that aims to address 
the need for women-specific programs 
that treat veterans with drug and alco-
hol dependency. 
The over 2 million women veterans 
who live in the United States face 
unique challenges that far too often 
are 
not 
appropriately 
addressed. 
Women veterans have higher rates of 
post-traumatic stress that can lead to 
substance abuse. Tragically, women 
veterans with substance-use disorders 
often have higher rates of suicide than 
their nonveteran peers. 
To address this crisis, women-specific 
programs make all the difference. As 
chair of the Women’s Veterans Task 
Force, I have heard how critical these 
treatment programs are to saving 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to cosponsor this important 
bill to ensure our Nation’s women vet-
erans have the resources and programs 
they need to thrive. 
f 
SEND ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
TO SENATE 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pose a simple question to my 
colleagues: Are we, as a body, subject 
to the rules in the Constitution? The 
answer is: Of course we are. 
However, Speaker PELOSI has chosen 
to ignore the Constitution and go 
rogue. Last month, she stood on this 
very floor and told us how important it 
is that we impeach the President im-
mediately. 
Now, 
outrageously, 
she 
claims for herself new powers never 
contemplated by the Constitution. 
By not transferring the Articles of 
Impeachment to the Senate, Speaker 
PELOSI has claimed for herself the au-
thority to veto any bill passed by this 
House with no possibility of override. 
This is a monstrous abuse of her posi-
tion and an outright attack on the 
trust of the American people. 
Clearly, she knows the impeachment 
process has been a sham all along and 
will fail in the Senate. I urge the 
Speaker to do her job and move the ar-
ticles to the Senate immediately. 
f 
ACT TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION 
DRUG PRICES 
(Ms. FRANKEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I 
am holding in my hand a pill cutter. 
Pharmacists tell me that it is one of 
the most popular gadgets in the drug-
store. 
Why? 
Because 
many 
prescription 
drugs are so unaffordable that, at the 
expense of their health, Americans are 
cutting their pills in half. Even some 
folks who have insurance go to the 
counter with a prescription and leave 
empty-handed because they can’t af-
ford the copay. 
That is why Democrats passed H.R. 3 
that will give Medicare the power to 
negotiate with drug companies, low-
ering the cost of the most expensive 
drugs for all Americans and stopping 
pharmaceutical companies from charg-
ing more for drugs that are cheaper in 
other countries. The new law would 
also set limits on prescription drug 
costs for Medicare beneficiaries while 
delivering them vision, dental, and 
hearing care. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to 
take up and pass this lifesaving bill. 
f 
COMMENDING PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ON IRAN ACTIONS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, last 
week, President Trump used his au-
thority and took clear, decisive action 
to protect American lives. 
By eradicating Iran’s top terrorist, 
he sent a clear message to our enemies 
that the Obama days of appeasement 
are over, and America will, once again, 
stand up to terrorists. We cannot allow 
another Benghazi. 
However, I am in disbelief that some 
Members of this body are finding ways 
to blame President Trump for the cur-
rent situation in Iran. 
Fact one, Iran’s regime has been an 
enemy of America since 1979. In recent 
months, they have shot down U.S. 
drones, attacked oil tankers, shot 
rockets at our bases, and attacked and 
tried to take over our embassy. Taking 
out Soleimani was a long-overdue ac-
tion to make the world a safer place 
and protect American lives. 
Fact two, President Trump does not 
want war. Yesterday, while addressing 
the Nation, President Trump made 
clear there is a path forward with 
peace for Iran if they are willing to set 
aside their nuclear ambitions. 
This is personal for me. My son and 
his family currently serve in an em-
bassy abroad in a war-torn land. I want 
to thank President Trump for pro-
tecting my family and our women and 
men in uniform abroad. 
f 
CALLING FOR COHERENT 
STRATEGY ON IRAN 
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise because it is one of the 
highest forms of patriotism to speak 
out when a government engages in 
reckless military action that could 
lead us to war. 
I previously served in Active Duty in 
the United States military, and the 
goal of any military action should be 
to make us more safe, not less safe. 
Unfortunately, as a result of Donald 
Trump’s impulsive decisionmaking, the 
following negative consequences have 
happened. Iran is no longer abiding by 
any limits on its nuclear program. The 
Iranian people who previously were 
protesting their own leadership have 
now rallied behind their government. 
The Iraqi parliament recently voted to 
kick U.S. troops out of their country, 
one of the goals of Iran. And we have 
had to stop counterterrorism actions 
against ISIS. 
This was a lose-lose-lose decision. We 
don’t need the President to make any 
more reckless decisions. We don’t need 
him to tweet out flag pictures. We need 
the President to articulate a coherent 
Iran strategy, which he still has failed 
to do.

HONORING SERGEANT FIRST 
CLASS EDWARD KRAMER 
(Mr. WALKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor one of 
our fallen servicemembers in Iraq, Ser-
geant First Class Edward Kramer. 
Sergeant Kramer was a North Caro-
lina National Guard soldier killed in 
action by an IED on his last day of 
combat operations while he was de-
ployed to Iraq, leaving a family and 
young children behind. 
General Soleimani’s brutal reign of 
terror was responsible for the deploy-
ment of the IEDs that killed and 
wounded soldiers such as Sergeant 
First 
Class 
Kramer. 
In 
fact, 
Soleimani’s reign of terror killed and 
wounded over 600 servicemembers in 
Iraq. 
We can never fully repay the families 
of our fallen soldiers, but we can seek 
justice. Terrorism must never prevail 
over American freedom and identity.

CONSTRAIN IRAN THROUGH 
DIPLOMACY 
(Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, America does not need or 
want a war with Iran. 
There are no political objectives we 
can reasonably achieve through force, 
and the President must not be allowed 
to fabricate a pretext for a conflict 
that will leave America, our allies, and 
the whole region less safe. But that is 
what he has been doing since tearing 
up the Iran nuclear deal and beginning 
a campaign of maximum pressure. 
Today’s War Powers Resolution re-
asserts Congress’ authority to declare 
war and imposes crucial restrictions on 
the President; namely, he cannot start 
a war without demonstrating an actual 
threat. This is something the adminis-
tration has failed to do, according to

both Democrats and Republicans from 
yesterday’s intelligence briefing. 
The best way to constrain the true 
threat of Iran is through the multilat-
eral diplomacy that achieved the his-
toric nuclear deal. With this clear con-
gressional statement that Congress has 
not authorized a war, I urge the Presi-
dent to immediately stop his erratic 
and impulsive provocations and take us 
back from the brink. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

CALLING ON SPEAKER TO DO HER 
JOB 
(Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
once a resolution passes the House, it 
goes to the Senate. Once all action is 
done, the Speaker is a mere func-
tionary in transmitting the will of the 
House to the Senate. 
It has been 21 calendar days, 12 work-
ing days, and 7 legislative days since 
the impeachment resolution was passed 
by this House. Since the resolution has 
not yet been delivered to the Senate, 
clause 8(b)(3)(C) of House rule I says 
that a vacancy in the Office of the 
Speaker may exist if the Speaker can-
not do her job. She has not done her 
job. 
America, I submit a vacancy exists in 
the Office of the Speaker of the United 
States House.

REPEAL AUMF, PROHIBIT WAR 
FUNDING 
(Mr. CLAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong 
support 
of 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN’s 
War 
Powers 
Resolution, 
which I am proud to cosponsor, and 
also to express my support for legisla-
tion 
introduced 
by 
Congresswoman 
BARBARA
LEE
and 
Congressman 
KHANNA to repeal the much-abused 2002 
AUMF and to prohibit funding of any 
offensive military operations against 
Iran. 
President Trump’s incoherent strat-
egy has brought us to the brink of an-
other disastrous war in the Mideast. 
I have seen this madness before. In 
2002, I stood here to oppose the use of 
force in Iraq because I knew that tragic 
war was based on a lie. 
The Constitution is clear. Donald 
Trump needs congressional authoriza-
tion to use force against Iran. 
So I say to you all today: No more 
lies, no more lost lives, and no war 
with Iran.

NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
APPRECIATION 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAHOOD. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, on National Law Enforcement 
Appreciation Day, I rise to recognize 
the brave men and women who work to 
keep our communities safe across cen-
tral and west central Illinois. 
From Peoria to Springfield, Jackson-
ville 
to 
Quincy, 
Macomb 
to 
Beardstown, law enforcement officers 
in Illinois’ 18th Congressional District 
are the hidden heroes of our State. 
Each day, Illinois police officers, depu-
ties, and State troopers leave their 
families with no certainty they will re-
turn home safely; yet they are willing 
to face these risks to keep our families, 
our children, and our schools safe. 
I am grateful for the courageous men 
and women who button up the uniform 
each day and thank them for pro-
tecting our families with bravery and 
pride. 
Madam Speaker, while we set aside 
today to recognize law enforcement, 
may we remember, each and every day 
throughout the year, the courage and 
sacrifice of these men and women.

TERMINATION OF USE OF ARMED 
FORCES 
TO 
ENGAGE 
IN 
HOS-
TILITIES IN OR AGAINST IRAN 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my colleague 
Representative SLOTKIN’s resolution re-
garding war powers. 
First and foremost, I am extremely 
grateful that the Iranian ballistic mis-
sile attacks on A1 Asad Air Base and 
Erbil resulted in zero injuries or cas-
ualties to our U.S. servicemembers or 
Iraqi allies. As always, I will continue 
to prioritize the safety of our deployed 
government officials, servicemembers, 
and contractors. 
Madam Speaker, let me be clear: 
Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist, and I 
hope his removal from the battlefield 
will, in fact, improve U.S. security in 
the long run. That being said, in the 
wake of the strike on Soleimani, let us 
not forget that we invest in our highly 
capable military to promote stability, 
not to undermine it. 
Our Founding Fathers made abun-
dantly clear in the Constitution that 
only Congress has the power to author-
ize use of military force. This resolu-
tion that we will be voting on later 
today is a necessary step to ensure de-
escalation with Iran while we await a 
clear strategy from the administration 
on how the President’s actions will re-
duce the chances of Iran becoming a 
nuclear state. 
U.S. Forces will always retain the in-
herent right to self-defense; however, 
any further military actions that can 
lead to war will require congressional 
authorization.

NO WAR WITH IRAN 
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address what I 
believe is in the best interests of the 
American people, the Iranian people, 
and our global community to say: No 
war with Iran. 
As an early opponent of the Iraq war 
back when I served in the New York 
City Council, I know we cannot afford 
to make reckless, irresponsible, violent 
decisions that put the lives of our serv-
icewomen and -men, diplomats, and the 
people here and in the Middle East in 
danger of death and destruction. 
We must exhaust all diplomatic 
means and put our political differences 
aside to stand for peaceful resolutions 
to human conflict before taking the ul-
timate step of engaging in war. 
For close to 20 years now, our Nation 
has been engaged in low-grade war 
games in the Middle East with the con-
stant threat of putting our children, 
our families, and our civil liberties at 
risk. We must oppose senseless acts of 
violence that take us many steps away 
from our progress. 
When we look back in our history 
books and tell the next generation sto-
ries of 2020, I want us to be able to say 
with pride that we kept the interests of 
our Nation we loved at heart without 
provocation, without the death and de-
struction of war. 
Madam Speaker, I stand before you 
today opposed to these efforts, and I 
support the War Powers Resolution, H. 
Con. Res. 83.

FOR THE PEOPLE— 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, as 
I rise today to begin discussing infra-
structure, I cannot let go the remarks 
from my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, their being completely ap-
palled by the Speaker not bringing 
over one resolution in what they be-
lieve to be a timely manner, but ex-
pressing no concern for the fact that 
the Senate has not taken up 400 bills 
that have been passed by this House, 
275 that were bipartisan, from their 
own side. 
But they have no concern for that. 
They do have concern for one bill. That 
is inappropriate, and I am very sad 
about my colleagues for this. 
Democrats have been working hard 
to fulfill a promise to the Nation. 
Americans in the Virgin Islands and in 
Puerto Rico are feeling the brunt of 
aging and weakening infrastructure—

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H. CON. RES. 83, IRAN WAR 
POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 781 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 781 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the concurrent resolution (H. Con. 
Res. 83) directing the President pursuant to 
section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution to 
terminate the use of United States Armed 
Forces to engage in hostilities in or against 
Iran. All points of order against consider-
ation of the concurrent resolution are 
waived. The amendment printed in the re-
port of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution shall be considered 
as adopted. The concurrent resolution, as 
amended, shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the con-
current resolution, as amended, are waived. 
The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the concurrent resolution, as 
amended, to adoption without intervening 
motion or demand for division of the ques-
tion except two hours of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. 
SEC. 2. Section 7 of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply during 
the remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth 
Congress to a measure respecting Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
781, providing for consideration of H. 
Con. Res. 83 under a closed rule. The 
resolution also provides 1 hour of gen-
eral debate, controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs. 
Madam Speaker, the question before 
us today is very simple: Should Presi-
dent Trump be allowed to send the 
United States hurtling toward war 
with Iran without prior congressional 
approval? 
It is a question we must wrestle with 
following the President’s actions last 
Thursday. That is when he ordered the 
lethal drone attack on Iraqi soil that 
killed Iranian General Soleimani. The 
outgoing Prime Minister has said the 
strike was carried out without Iraqi 
permission or knowledge. It was done 
without any plan for the consequences 
in the region or the world. And, more 
troubling still, it was carried out with-
out any input from the people’s Rep-
resentatives here in Congress. 
Think about that. 
Madam Speaker, just a month ago, 
Iran was staring down some of the 
most intense antigovernment protests 
in a decade. Thousands took to the 
streets of Tehran to express growing 
frustration and anger with their lead-
ers. 
But what a difference a month 
makes. Protestors—men, women, and 
children—have again taken to the 
streets of Tehran. Only this time, their 
anger wasn’t directed at their own 
leaders; it was directed at the United 
States of America—all because of the 
President’s unilateral decision. 
Madam Speaker, that is what hap-
pens when monumental decisions of 
war and peace are made in a vacuum 
with no regard for the consequences. 
Things usually don’t go very well. 
Rather than protect our national se-
curity and stabilize the region, Presi-
dent Trump’s reckless decision to 
strike Soleimani united Iran. It has led 
to retaliatory strikes on two bases 
used by U.S. and coalition forces in 
Iraq, and it has put our troops and dip-
lomats serving overseas in greater dan-
ger. 
Now, make no mistake: This decision 
has endangered all Americans every-
where. Hardliners are emboldened; 4,000 
more U.S. troops have been deployed to 
the region; operations against ISIS 
have been suspended; the Iraqi Par-
liament has voted to kick American 
troops out of Iraq—all because of the 
brash decision of one man: the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, there was no ques-
tion that Soleimani was a ruthless 
military commander. He had Amer-
ican, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi, and Yem-
eni blood on his hands. But that is not 
up for debate today, nor is the question 
of whether or not killing him was a 
good or bad idea. 
The President of the United States 
assassinated a high-level foreign mili-
tary commander without asking or 
even notifying Congress beforehand. 
Madam Speaker, with little evidence, 
the President claims his actions pre-
vented an imminent threat, but the 
American people have heard that one 
before. We remember the stories about 
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
We remember the tens of thousands of 
American soldiers who paid the price 
for that deception. 
Madam Speaker, is this Congress 
going to sit by and allow that to hap-
pen in Iran, or are we going to ensure 
that this body acts before a war begins 
that could continue long after Presi-
dent Trump leaves office? 
Now, the Constitution is clear; it is 
crystal clear. Article I, Section 8 gives 
Congress the power to declare war, but 
President Trump treated Congress as if 
it were an afterthought in a decision 
that has destabilized the region and 
shaken the world. 
More than 4,000 of our brave men and 
women are now being sent to the Per-
sian Gulf, all without any input from 
the people’s Chamber. 
We represent the brave young men 
and women who are deploying to Ku-
wait; we represent those deploying to 
Iraq; and we represent those deploying 
elsewhere across the Middle East. Each 
of us speaks for them, and we speak for 
their families, who are scared sick as 
their loved ones receive orders to de-
ploy. 
Madam Speaker, we must summon 
the courage to be their voice. 
Now, I am glad that the United 
States and Iran have taken a step back 
from the brink of war, but what we 
heard from the President yesterday 
was more of the same bluster. It is 
clear, even after the briefing by the ad-
ministration yesterday that many of 
us attended, that he has no clue at 
all—none—about 
what 
could 
come 
next. 
Now, make no mistake: The world is 
less safe because of Trump’s chaotic 
foreign policy. The impacts of his 
strikes are still reverberating in the re-
gion and across the world, and we can-
not sit silently by. 
The Constitution makes the Presi-
dent Commander in Chief, but it gives 
only Congress the power to declare 
war. The Founders knew that decisions 
of this magnitude required consulta-
tion between the branches of govern-
ment, no matter who is in the White

House, no matter who controls the ma-
jority on Capitol Hill. 
Our Democrats don’t want war with 
Iran; most Republicans don’t want war 
with Iran; and the American people 
certainly don’t want a war with Iran. I 
think that would be catastrophic. We 
should be stopping costly, endless wars, 
not creating new ones. 
But whatever you believe, have the 
courage of your conviction, have the 
courage to vote, and that is what the 
underlying War Powers Resolution is 
all about. Congress needs to authorize 
any additional hostilities with Iran. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
decisions 
aren’t easy. I understand that. There is 
no more consequential vote than decid-
ing whether to send men and women off 
to war and into harm’s way. We weigh 
that decision knowing that, despite our 
hopes and prayers, lives are lost in 
combat. 
b 1245 
Mothers and fathers could lose their 
children. Kids could be forced to grow 
up without a parent. 
But when we were sworn in, each of 
us took an oath to defend the Constitu-
tion, and that means wrestling with 
this very tough decision when nec-
essary. The only question now is 
whether we have the guts to uphold 
that oath. 
Madam Speaker, with the Middle 
East held captive to the whims of a 
reckless President, and with the Com-
mander in Chief without a clue, I pray 
that we, in Congress, have that cour-
age. 
On behalf of our troops, their fami-
lies, and the American people, I urge 
my colleagues to support this rule and 
the underlying resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes. 
Today, we consider H. Con. Res. 83 or, 
technically, we are considering the rule 
to consider H. Con. Res. 83, a resolution 
to remove the United States Armed 
Forces from hostilities in Iran. 
But the thing is, we are not engaged 
in hostilities in Iran. Once again, we 
are considering a measure that will 
have no force of law. This is a non-
binding concurrent resolution. 
There was some debate in the Rules 
Committee last night on whether a 
concurrent resolution under the War 
Powers Resolution is, in fact, non-
binding. But in the Senate, a joint res-
olution has been introduced, making it 
likely that this House Concurrent Res-
olution will go no further than the ac-
tion today. 
The Constitution grants Congress the 
power to declare war. The Constitution 
also designates the President as the 
Commander in Chief of the Armed 
Forces. This sets up a conflict. The 
courts have not delineated the bound-
aries of these authorities or deter-
mined gaps between them that would 
either deny power to a President or to 
the Congress, one at the expense of the 
other. 
In Federalist Number 69, Alexander 
Hamilton argued the President’s power 
resides only in the direction of the 
military as placed by law at his com-
mand. Presidents have long argued 
that their role as Commander in Chief, 
coupled with their inherent authority 
over foreign affairs, grants them the 
power to engage the Armed Forces, 
short of war, as they see fit. 
Since the founding of our country, 
the Supreme Court has ruled both that 
the President enjoys greater discretion 
when acting with respect to matters of 
foreign affairs and, that absent an au-
thorization of action during wartime, 
any action by the President was void. 
Despite the struggle to maintain the 
separation of powers with regard to en-
gaging our Armed Forces, the motiva-
tion underlying the inclusion in the 
Constitution of these powers for both 
the President and the Congress con-
tinues to this day: The desire to pro-
tect and defend the United States, its 
persons, and its assets. 
Congress passed the War Powers Res-
olution in 1973, largely in response to 
the experiences in Korea and Vietnam. 
The War Powers Resolution authorizes 
the engagement of the forces of the 
United States in hostilities when: 
There is a declaration of war; or there 
exists a specific statutory authoriza-
tion; or a national emergency created 
by attack upon the United States, its 
territories or possessions, or its Armed 
Forces. 
To assess the current situation, let’s 
examine what has led us to this point. 
In June of 2019, Iran shot down a sur-
veillance aircraft that was flying over 
international waters near the Strait of 
Hormuz. This was an unmanned aerial 
drone. 
At the time, President Trump was 
advised by his military advisers to 
strike back, but the President opted 
not to strike back because it would 
have resulted in Iranian casualties, and 
he felt he could not justify creation of 
human casualties because of the loss of 
a machine. I agree with the President 
in that decision. I think his restraint 
was remarkable, but, certainly, exem-
plary. 
In September of 2019, Iranian cruise 
missiles struck nearly 20 targets of 
critical energy infrastructure in Saudi 
Arabia. This disrupted a significant 
portion of Saudi oil production. 
In December of 2019, Iranian-backed 
forces in Iraq targeted military facili-
ties where United States forces were 
co-located. 
On December 27, an Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah group, a U.S.-designated for-
eign terrorist organization, attacked a 
base in northern Iraq, and they killed a 
U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. 
servicemembers. 
The United States responded, and it 
launched a retaliatory air strike in 
Iraq and Syria. 
On January 2, 2020, acting on intel-
ligence of imminent threat to Amer-
ican interests, and in response to the 
persistent attack by Iranian-backed 
entities, the United States military 
killed 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani. 
Soleimani was the long-time leader of 
the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps 
Quds Force. 
The Iran Revolutionary Guard is a 
U.S.-designated terrorist organization. 
It has been supporting proxy forces 
throughout the Middle East and at-
tacking United States interests and al-
lies for over a decade. 
Soleimani previously operated under 
strict security but, in recent years, he 
has moved much more freely and open-
ly, believing that the United States did 
not have the willpower to be able to at-
tack him. His atrocities include the 
deaths of hundreds of Americans and 
the attempted assassination of a Saudi 
diplomat in the United States, among 
other things. 
President Obama’s former Secretary 
of Homeland Security, Secretary Jeh 
Johnson, 
stated 
that 
General 
Soleimani was a legitimate military 
target. 
I do want to be clear. The last thing 
that I want to see and I suspect anyone 
in this body wants to see is our men 
and women committed to another con-
flict in the Middle East. We want those 
conflicts to end, as does the President. 
But, Madam Speaker, today the 
world is a safer place without General 
Soleimani. And who would want him to 
come back? 
Despite the disagreement in how fur-
ther to engage in the Middle East, in 
the country of Iran, be it militarily or 
diplomatically, 
the 
last 
thing 
we 
should be doing is broadcasting our 
plans to the enemy. 
By passing this War Powers Resolu-
tion, directing the President to remove 
United States Armed Forces from hos-
tilities with Iran, a point that is, in 
itself in contention, we are effectively 
telling the Iranian mullahs that it is 
okay to push forward with their ag-
gressive posturing. Rather than stating 
what the President cannot do, perhaps 
we should be authorizing what the 
President can do. 
Last night, in the Rules Committee, 
it became clear that both Republicans 
and Democrats agree that the world is 
a 
safer 
place 
without 
General 
Soleimani, and any war with Iran 
needs to be authorized by Congress 
seemed to be general agreement. 
Democrats want to maintain the sep-
aration of powers, as do I, but the ques-
tion is, to what extent are we jeopard-
izing our safety? 
I believe Congress does need to au-
thorize military action and maintain 
the separation of powers as intended by 
the Founders, but we don’t need to 
broadcast it to the world. 
While we may be divided on the need 
for this resolution, let us recognize the 
privilege that we enjoy each and every 
day, being able to stand in this House 
and debate these issues without fear of

retribution of our government. Those 
protesters in Iran did not enjoy that 
freedom. They cut off the internet and 
eliminated those protesters. That is 
why you don’t see them anymore. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just respond to the gentleman 
when he says that this is a concurrent 
resolution here in the House and it is 
nonbinding and merely symbolic. Let 
me point out to him that the law 
states clearly that this sort of resolu-
tion reins in the President. The War 
Powers Resolution requires the Presi-
dent to stop using American forces and 
hostilities if Congress so directs by 
concurrent resolution. 
Moreover, the Constitution gives war 
powers to the Congress, not to the 
President. And if both Houses pass this 
resolution, it is a clear statement that 
Congress is denying the President the 
authority to wage war, and that the 
President must come to Congress for 
an authorization prior to further hos-
tilities. 
And by the way, we are not just pur-
suing a concurrent resolution. Senator 
KAINE of Virginia, over in the Senate, 
is pursuing a joint resolution; so we are 
covering all bases here because we are 
deeply concerned that we may end up 
in a war inadvertently here, and that 
Congress will have no role in it. 
Again, I would urge the gentleman to 
read the War Powers Resolution. I have 
a copy here, and the accompanying re-
port when this resolution was signed 
into law. The report, with regard to 
consultation, is crystal clear that con-
sultation is meant prior to introducing 
our forces and engaging into hos-
tilities, which is something the Presi-
dent didn’t even notify us of. 
And in terms of the President’s exer-
cising this remarkable restraint, I just 
have a very different opinion. Have you 
read his Twitter account? Have you 
been listening to him on TV as he 
brags about the shiny, expensive weap-
ons we have that he would love to use? 
The rhetoric, the threat to bomb cul-
tural sites, which is a war crime? I 
mean, the gentleman may be totally at 
ease with all of that, but I am not; and 
most of the American people are scared 
as hell of this President’s rhetoric 
when it comes to a potential war with 
Iran. 
All we are saying here is that we 
ought to stand up for this institution, 
and stand with the Constitution, and 
make it very clear that if the President 
wants to go to war in Iran, that he 
needs to come to Congress to get that 
declaration, to get that authorization. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
SHALALA), a member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the War Pow-
ers Resolution to limit the President’s 
military actions regarding Iran. 
As a Member of Congress, one of our 
most sacred votes is our vote to declare 
war. We, therefore, have an obligation 
to study the evidence and share con-
cerns about the administration’s deci-
sion to engage in hostilities against 
Iran. We have a duty to question its 
strategy, or lack of strategy, moving 
forward. 
My expertise, Madam Speaker, is not 
foreign policy, but I know Iran. I lived 
there. I worked there as a Peace Corps 
volunteer many years ago. I have been 
a student of Iranian history and poli-
tics for more than 3 decades. 
There is no question about Iran’s role 
in 
sponsoring 
terrorism. 
Soleimani 
himself was responsible for the deaths 
of hundreds of Americans and thou-
sands around the world. He actively 
worked to foment instability across 
the Middle East on behalf of the gov-
ernment of Iran. 
Nevertheless, the President of the 
United States, in his response to Iran, 
announced that he would commit a war 
crime by targeting Iran’s extraor-
dinary cultural sites. War crimes. No 
matter who is President of the United 
States, when he or she indicates that 
they are prepared to commit a war 
crime, then Congress better step up 
and reassert its authority under the 
Constitution. 
We must demand that the President 
justify any act, and that is what this 
resolution does. That is why I support 
it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, let 
me yield myself 30 seconds for the pur-
pose of response before I yield to Mr. 
COLE. 
And my response would be, had the 
gentleman from Massachusetts yielded 
to me for a question, my question was 
going to be, was he asking for unani-
mous consent to change the concurrent 
resolution to a joint resolution such 
that it could align and harmonize with 
the Senate activity and then, there-
fore, maybe accomplish something. But 
he didn’t. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE), the ranking member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank my good friend, Dr. BURGESS, for 
yielding. 
I rise, Madam Speaker, in reluctant 
opposition, quite frankly, to both the 
rule and the underlying legislation. 
As my good friend, Chairman MCGOV-
ERN knows, we have actually worked 
together to try and expand and reclaim 
war-making authority for the Congress 
of the United States, and I would offer 
and continue to work with him in that 
partnership. I think that is something 
that needs to be continued. 
I also think we have no difference 
that if we were to engage in a war with 
Iraq, it would require congressional au-
thorization. And frankly, last night, in 
the Rules Committee, I offered a proc-
ess whereby we could work together in 
a bipartisan fashion; that is, let’s just 
follow the War Powers Resolution. 
Let’s submit something to the com-
mittee of jurisdiction, which is actu-
ally the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
We have a deadline or a timeline laid 
out in the War Powers Act; they could 
operate within that. Within a matter of 
a few weeks we would then, in a very 
bipartisan manner, bring something to 
the floor. 
Let’s contrast that with how this 
particular resolution came to the floor. 
We got it about 45 minutes before the 
Rules Committee meeting. It is written 
in the Speaker’s Office; rewritten in 
the Speaker’s Office, and it is sent 
down here to make a political point, 
not to actually do something that 
would substantively restore congres-
sional war-making power. This is all 
politics; that is all it is. 
b 1300 
The political aim here is for our 
friends to suggest that the President 
either wants war with Iran or has acted 
hastily, precipitously, and recklessly. 
Neither of those things is true. 
Frankly, our latest dispute with Iran 
begins with the decision by this admin-
istration appropriately to withdraw 
from the very ill-advised Iranian nu-
clear deal, a deal, by the way, that the 
majority of this House and the major-
ity of the United States Senate op-
posed, 
but 
President 
Obama 
went 
ahead with it anyway. 
What has been the Iranian response 
to our withdrawal? A series of provo-
cations to which, as my good friend Mr. 
BURGESS pointed out, the President, by 
and large, has acted with remarkable 
restraint. Let’s just go through some of 
those provocations. 
First, it was attacks on ships in the 
Strait of Hormuz in the gulf. What was 
the President’s response? Well, let’s or-
ganize an international flotilla to de-
fend these ships. He did not attack 
Iran. 
Next, as my good friend from Texas 
pointed out, we see strikes into Iraq 
itself. Particularly, we see an attack 
on Saudi Arabian oil refineries. What is 
the President’s response? Well, let’s 
not attack Iran. Let’s send defensive 
capabilities from our country there and 
protect those sites. 
Then, we see attacks on American 
forces in Iraq. What is the President’s 
response? As my friend pointed out, 
let’s go after the Shia militias. Let’s 
not attack Iran. 
Finally, after that, when the Presi-
dent responds, we see another attack. 
In that attack, as my friend pointed 
out, an American contractor died, and 
four American servicemembers were 
wounded. Again, the President re-
sponds by attacking Shia militia. 
Then, the next response, our embassy 
is assaulted. Thank goodness, no loss of 
life, but I think the President had had 
enough. 
By the way, just after that assault 
happens, who magically shows up in 
violation of a U.N. resolution in Iraq? 
Our good friend General Soleimani, a 
designated terrorist for 13 years, a per-
son who has killed hundreds of Ameri-
cans, wounded thousands more, not to

mention the tens of thousands across 
the region. What does the President 
do? The President takes out a legiti-
mate terrorist target. In Iran? No, the 
President doesn’t want to do that. He 
does it in Iraq. 
Now, how anybody could have any 
doubt about the President’s desire to, 
number one, strike at a terrorist, and, 
number two, avoid war, I will never 
know. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, passing 
this resolution, as my good friend Dr. 
BURGESS suggested, sends the wrong 
message to the wrong people at pre-
cisely the wrong time. 
The President did the right thing 
here. He has acted in a restrained man-
ner. He has endured, and our country 
has endured, endless provocations. 
We should reject this rule. Frankly, 
we should have a regular process where 
we actually go back to the committee 
of jurisdiction. We should absolutely 
reject the underlying resolution. 
Before I conclude, I want to mention 
I know my friend is very sincere in his 
opinions on expanding congressional 
war power. There is no doubt in my 
mind about it. We have worked on that 
before. I look forward to working with 
my friend on that issue again. This is 
the wrong vehicle, the wrong place, the 
wrong time, the wrong consequences 
for our own country to pass this kind 
of legislation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me say to the gentleman from Okla-
homa that I look forward to working 
with him on the war powers and other 
issues related to the executive branch 
encroaching on legislative powers in 
the future. I hope we can work in a bi-
partisan way and make some progress 
here. 
I include in the RECORD a January 4 
New York Times article entitled ‘‘As 
Tensions With Iran Escalated, Trump 
Opted for Most Extreme Measure.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 4, 2020] 
AS TENSIONS WITH IRAN ESCALATED, TRUMP 
OPTED FOR MOST EXTREME MEASURE 
(By Helene Cooper, Eric Schmitt, Maggie 
Haberman and Rukmini Callimachi) 
WASHINGTON.—In the chaotic days leading 
to the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, 
Iran’s most powerful commander, top Amer-
ican military officials put the option of kill-
ing him—which they viewed as the most ex-
treme response to recent Iranian-led vio-
lence in Iraq—on the menu they presented to 
President Trump. 
They didn’t think he would take it. In the 
wars waged since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, 
Pentagon officials have often offered improb-
able options to presidents to make other pos-
sibilities appear more palatable. 
After initially rejecting the Suleimani op-
tion on Dec. 28 and authorizing airstrikes on 
an Iranian-backed Shiite militia group in-
stead, a few days later Mr. Trump watched, 
fuming, as television reports showed Iranian- 
backed attacks on the American Embassy in 
Baghdad, according to Defense Department 
and administration officials. 
By late Thursday, the president had gone 
for the extreme option. Top Pentagon offi-
cials were stunned. 
Mr. Trump made the decision, senior offi-
cials said on Saturday, despite disputes in 
the administration about the significance of 
what some officials said was a new stream of 
intelligence that warned of threats to Amer-
ican embassies, consulates and military per-
sonnel in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. General 
Suleimani had just completed a tour of his 
forces in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, and was 
planning an ‘‘imminent’’ attack that could 
claim hundreds of lives, those officials said. 
‘‘Days, weeks,’’ Gen. Mark A. Milley, the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on 
Friday, when asked how imminent any at-
tacks could be, without offering more detail 
other than to say that new information 
about unspecified plotting was ‘‘clear and 
unambiguous.’’ 
But some officials voiced private skep-
ticism about the rationale for a strike on 
General Suleimani, who was responsible for 
the deaths of hundreds of American troops 
over the years. According to one United 
States official, the new intelligence indi-
cated ‘‘a normal Monday in the Middle 
East’’—Dec. 30—and General Suleimani’s 
travels amounted to ‘‘business as usual.’’ 
That official described the intelligence as 
thin and said that General Suleimani’s at-
tack was not imminent because of commu-
nications the United States had between 
Iran’s 
supreme 
leader, 
Ayatollah 
Ali 
Khamenei, and General Suleimani showing 
that the ayatollah had not yet approved any 
plans by the general for an attack. The aya-
tollah, according to the communications, 
had asked General Suleimani to come to 
Tehran for further discussions at least a 
week before his death. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice 
President Mike Pence were two of the most 
hawkish voices arguing for a response to Ira-
nian aggression, according to administration 
officials. Mr. Pence’s office helped run herd 
on meetings and conference calls held by of-
ficials in the run-up to the strike. 
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen-
eral Milley declined to comment for this ar-
ticle, but General Milley’s spokeswoman, 
Col. DeDe Halfhill, said, without elaborating, 
that ‘‘some of the characterizations being as-
serted by other sources are false’’ and that 
she would not discuss conversations between 
General Milley and the president. 
The fallout from Mr. Trump’s targeted 
killing is now underway. On Saturday in 
Iraq, the American military was on alert as 
tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters 
marched through the streets of Baghdad and 
calls accelerated to eject the United States 
from the country. United States Central 
Command, which oversees American mili-
tary operations in the Middle East, said 
there were two rocket attacks near Iraqi 
bases that host American troops, but no one 
was injured. 
In Iran, the ayatollah vowed ‘‘forceful re-
venge’’ as the country mourned the death of 
General Suleimani. 
In Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump lashed 
back, promising to strike 52 sites across 
Iran—representing the number of American 
hostages taken by Iran in 1979—if Iran at-
tacked Americans or American interests. On 
Saturday night, Mr. Trump warned on Twit-
ter that some sites were ‘‘at a very high 
level & important to Iran & the Iranian cul-
ture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL 
BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.’’ 
The president issued those warnings after 
American spy agencies on Saturday detected 
that Iranian ballistic missile units across 
the country had gone to a heightened state 
of readiness, a United States official said on 
Saturday night. 
Other officials said it was unclear whether 
Iran was dispersing its ballistic missile 
units—the heart of the Iranian military—to 
avoid American attack, or was mobilizing 
the units for a major strike against Amer-
ican targets or allies in the region in retalia-
tion for General Suleimani’ s death. 
On Capitol Hill, Democrats voiced growing 
suspicions about the intelligence that led to 
the killing. At the White House, officials for-
mally notified Congress of a war powers reso-
lution with what the administration said 
was a legal justification for the strike. 
At Fort Bragg, N.C., some 3,500 soldiers, 
one of the largest rapid deployments in dec-
ades, are bound for the Middle East. 
General Suleimani, who was considered the 
most important person in Iran after Aya-
tollah Khamenei, was a commanding general 
of a sovereign government. The last time the 
United States killed a major military leader 
in a foreign country was during World War 
II, when the American military shot down 
the plane carrying the Japanese admiral 
Isoroku Yamamoto. 
But administration officials are playing 
down General Suleimani’s status as a part of 
the Iranian state, suggesting his title gave 
him cover for terrorist activities. In the days 
since his death, they have sought to describe 
the strike as more in line with the killing of 
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State 
leader, who died in October in an American 
commando raid in Syria. 
Administration officials insisted they did 
not anticipate sweeping retaliation from 
Iran, in part because of divisions in the Ira-
nian leadership. But Mr. Trump’s two prede-
cessors—Presidents George W. Bush and 
Barack Obama—had rejected killing General 
Suleimani as too provocative. 
General 
Suleimani 
had 
been 
in 
Mr. 
Trump’s sights since the beginning of the ad-
ministration, although it was a Dec. 27 rock-
et attack on an Iraqi military base outside 
Kirkuk, which left an American civilian con-
tractor dead, that set the killing in motion. 
General Milley and Mr. Esper traveled on 
Sunday to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Palm 
Beach resort, a day after officials presented 
the president with an initial list of options 
for how to deal with escalating violence 
against American targets in Iraq. 
The options included strikes on Iranian 
ships or missile facilities or against Iranian- 
backed militia groups in Iraq. The Pentagon 
also tacked on the choice of targeting Gen-
eral Suleimani, mainly to make other op-
tions seem reasonable. 
Mr. Trump chose strikes against militia 
groups. On Sunday, the Pentagon announced 
that airstrikes approved by the president 
had struck three locations in Iraq and two in 
Syria 
controlled 
by 
the 
group, 
Kataib 
Hezbollah. 
Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon 
spokesman, said the targets included weap-
ons storage facilities and command posts 
used to attack American and partner forces. 
About two dozen militia fighters were killed. 
‘‘These were on remote sites,’’ General 
Milley told reporters on Friday in his Pen-
tagon office. ‘‘There was no collateral dam-
age.’’ 
But the Iranians viewed the strikes as out 
of proportion to their attack on the Iraqi 
base and Iraqis, largely member’s of Iranian- 
backed militias, staged violent protests out-
side the American Embassy in Baghdad. Mr. 
Trump, who aides said had on his mind the 
specter of the 2012 attacks on the American 
compound in Benghazi, Libya, became in-
creasingly angry as he watched television 
images of pro-Iranian demonstrators storm-
ing the embassy. Aides said he worried that 
no response would look weak after repeated 
threats by the United States. 
When Mr. Trump chose the option of kill-
ing General Suleimani, top military offi-
cials, 
flabbergasted, 
were 
immediately

alarmed about the prospect of Iranian retal-
iatory strikes on American troops in the re-
gion. It is unclear if General Milley or Mr. 
Esper pushed back on the president’s deci-
sion. 
Over the next several days, the military’s 
Special Operations Command looked for an 
opportunity to hit General Suleimani, who 
operated in the open and was treated like a 
celebrity in many places he visited in the 
Middle East. Military and intelligence offi-
cials said the strike drew on information 
from secret informants, electronic inter-
cepts, reconnaissance aircraft and other sur-
veillance tools. 
The option that was eventually approved 
depended 
on 
who 
would 
greet 
General 
Suleimani at his expected arrival on Friday 
at Baghdad International Airport. If he was 
met by Iraqi government officials allied with 
Americans, one American official said, the 
strike would be called off. But the official 
said it was a ‘‘clean party,’’ meaning mem-
bers of Kataib Hezbollah, including its lead-
er, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Mr. Trump au-
thorized the killing at about 5 p.m. on 
Thursday, officials said. 
On Friday, missiles fired from an American 
MQ–9 Reaper blew up General Suleimani’s 
convoy as it departed the airport. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MORELLE), a member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair and my 
colleague from the Rules Committee, 
Mr. MCGOVERN, for yielding me this 
minute. 
We begin the new year in turbulent 
and uncertain times, particularly with 
regard to Iran and the Middle East. 
Protecting our national interests and 
securing the safety and security of the 
American people must be the highest 
priorities of our government. I am 
gravely concerned the recent actions of 
the Trump administration have desta-
bilized the region and undermined 
those priorities. 
Article I of the United States Con-
stitution vests in the House and Senate 
the responsibility to declare war, to ap-
propriate money for the national de-
fense, and, in doing so, to ensure no 
President 
employs 
military 
action 
without careful consultation of and au-
thorization by Congress. 
That is why it is so important that 
we take action to reaffirm these re-
sponsibilities by passing the resolution 
before us, which I am proud to cospon-
sor. 
The use of United States Armed 
Forces to engage in hostilities against 
Iran must come only after thoughtful 
deliberation and approval by Congress. 
As we move forward, we must all seek 
to achieve a peaceful resolution that 
protects American interests at home 
and abroad. 
I join with all Americans in praying 
for the safety of our courageous serv-
icemembers and urge my colleagues to 
support this rule and the underlying 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), a valuable 
member of the House Committee on 
Rules. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
First, I thank President Trump for 
making a decisive action to protect 
Americans. Thank you. 
The world now knows that Obama’s 
appeasement strategy policies, includ-
ing giving billions of dollars to Iran, 
are over. It didn’t work. The world 
knows that when President Trump says 
we are not going to cross this red line, 
they know he means it. 
In Rules Committee last night and 
again today, I listened as my Demo-
cratic colleagues claim what this reso-
lution is all about. They claim that it 
is about making sure Congress exerts 
its authority to approve future war 
against Iran. But that is not what this 
resolution does. 
In fact, let’s read the title of this res-
olution. It says: ‘‘Directing the Presi-
dent pursuant to section 5(c) of the 
War Powers Resolution to terminate 
the use of United States Armed Forces 
to engage in hostilities in or against 
Iran.’’ It doesn’t say anything about fu-
ture war. 
We do not currently have U.S. Armed 
Forces engaged in hostilities in or 
against Iran. If Democrats are serious 
about making sure Congress has its say 
in declaring war, they would follow the 
statutory guidelines as described by 
Representative COLE. They are already 
in there. Go to the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Instead, Democrats have chosen to 
short circuit the process yet again to 
achieve a partisan objective. 
As a member of the Rules Com-
mittee, I saw the language of the reso-
lution 45 minutes before the Rules 
Committee started. This is not a seri-
ous effort for such a serious subject. 
Here are the facts. Iran and Iranian- 
backed militias have escalated their 
attacks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mrs. 
LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, in 
June 2019, Iran shot down a U.S. drone. 
Trump said, no, we are not going to re-
taliate because no U.S. lives were lost. 
Iran attacked Saudi oil fields. Iran- 
backed militia killed a U.S. citizen and 
wounded four troops. Then, an Iran- 
backed militia attacked the U.S. Em-
bassy. 
Soleimani was a terrorist designated 
by the Obama administration. 
Let me read very quickly what the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff have said. He has 
had 40 years of military experience 
under all different administrations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mrs. 
LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. General Milley said the 
trigger for the drone strike that killed 
Soleimani was ‘‘clear, unambiguous in-
telligence indicating a significant cam-
paign of violence against the United 
States 
in 
the 
days, 
weeks, 
and 
months,’’ and that the administration 
would have been ‘‘culpably negligent’’ 
if it did not act. 
This is a man who has been in the 
military for 40 years under different 
administrations, and you are going to 
doubt what he has to say? 
I thank President Trump for pro-
tecting American citizens. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a January 8 Van-
ity Fair article entitled ‘‘There Is No 
Strategy: Diplomats React to Trump’s 
Erratic, Narcissistic Iran Policy.’’ 
[From Vanity Fair, Jan. 8, 2020] 
‘‘THERE IS NO STRATEGY’’: DIPLOMATS REACT 
TO
TRUMP’S
ERRATIC, NARCISSISTIC
IRAN 
POLICY 
(By Abigail Tracy) 
After the American drone strike and Iran’s 
measured retaliation, some State vets worry 
that Trump is a wild card, the biggest dan-
ger: ‘‘From a political standpoint,’’ says one, 
‘‘they have behaved a hell of a lot more ra-
tionally and predictably than we have.’’ 
In the aftermath of Iran’s strike against 
two airbases, in retaliation for the drone 
strike that killed Qasem Soleimani last 
week, a sigh of relief was breathed, but for 
what? That there had been no casualties 
from Iran’s cruise missiles was a huge reason 
to be thankful. (U.S. officials have since sug-
gested this was intentional.) But there was 
also a sense of relief that Trump had stepped 
back—as if he were the wild card. The devel-
opments laid bare what diplomats I spoke 
with identified as a discomforting reality in 
the Trump era. ‘‘Up is down and down is up,’’ 
a former U.S. ambassador in the region told 
me, noting Iran’s decision to notify the 
Iraqis ahead of the attack on Tuesday and 
Mohammad Javad Zarif’s message of detente 
in the face of Trump’s bluster. ‘‘Who 
would’ve imagined that it’s the American 
president who is a crazy person gunning for 
war and the mullahs who are being careful 
and deliberate and cautious . . . . They have 
done terrible things—I am not going to de-
fend the fact that the country holds hostages 
and 
has 
absolutely 
supported 
terrorist 
groups and those sorts of things—but from a 
political standpoint, they have behaved a 
hell of a lot more rationally and predictably 
than we have,’’ this person added. ‘‘Do you 
take comfort in the fact that Iran is the ra-
tional actor or does that scare the bejesus 
out of you even more?’’ 
A former Foreign Service Officer who 
worked on Iran under Barack Obama echoed 
the point. ‘‘I think it is interesting that 
[Iran has taken] every opportunity to show 
that they’re actually more responsible than 
the U.S. president in executing this con-
flict,’’ this person said. ‘‘It boggles the mind 
to me that we are almost more concerned, I 
think, about our own president than we are 
about the way others may retaliate, which is 
really scary.’’ 
Diplomats I spoke with are clear-eyed in 
their 
belief 
that 
Iran’s 
retaliation 
for 
Soleimani is not complete; they are bracing 
for—if not further military attacks—subse-
quent responses, such as cyberattacks or 
even kidnappings. To a fault, they, too, are 
not defending Iran’s past malfeasance. And 
Trump’s position on the wake of the attacks 
is welcomed by veterans of Foggy Bottom.

January 9, 2020 
‘‘President Trump made the right decision 
not to respond to Iran’s missile attacks. 
There were no American casualties and the 
Iranians are clearly signaling they don’t 
want a war,’’ Nicholas Burns, the former am-
bassador to NATO, told me. The problem is 
that Trump has thus far failed to chart a 
path forward with Iran. Instead, he has shut-
tled between slamming Iran, slighting his 
predecessor’s signature Iran nuclear deal, 
and patting himself on the back for the 
death of Soleimani and Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi, the former leader of the Islamic 
State whom the United States killed in Oc-
tober. ‘‘His speech was confusing about his 
strategy. It is not at all clear if he intends to 
contain Iran through deterrence or to weak-
en its government and seek regime change,’’ 
Burns added. ‘‘He owes the American public, 
the Congress, and our allies a much more 
specific and consistent game plan. Other-
wise, it will be difficult for him to gain do-
mestic and allied support.’’ 
As I reported in the aftermath of the 
Soleimani’s killing last week, a chief con-
cern within the diplomatic ranks was that 
the Trump administration, still lacking a co-
herent foreign policy, had failed to ade-
quately contemplate and prepare for the 
international and Iranian response to the 
airstrike against the top Iranian general. In-
deed, the Trump administration certainly 
appeared to be caught flat-footed when the 
Iraqi parliament voted to expel U.S. troops 
from the country over the weekend. While 
asserting that the killing of Soleimani left 
Americans safer, Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper 
have yet to detail the imminent threat they 
claim the Iranian general posed to U.S. in-
terests. And Trump’s remarks on Wednesday 
arguably raised more questions than they 
answered. As the former ambassador in the 
region put it, ‘‘There is no strategy. It is sat-
isfying Trump’s ego at every step. It’s all it 
is for us, there is zero strategy and it’s all 
strategy on Iran’s side.’’ 
Beyond 
his 
‘‘America 
First’’ 
tagline, 
Trump has failed to formulate anything re-
sembling a coherent foreign policy. Rather, 
he has a domestic policy that influences 
American posturing abroad. The clearest 
through line in Trump’s various foreign pol-
icy decisions can largely be summed up as 
‘‘the opposite of what Obama did.’’ But this 
lack of coherence is particularly troubling in 
the Middle East and is amplified by the re-
ality that he’s surrounded by hawks with 
hard-ons for toppling the Iranian regime, 
like Pompeo. ‘‘The most frustrating thing is 
that this is entirely of his own making. You 
think about where we were less than five 
years ago, when we got to the deal. Things 
certainly weren’t perfect by any means. 
They were still causing a lot of harm and 
doing things against our interests in the re-
gion, but compare that to where we are 
today and it is so entirely avoidable,’’ the 
former Foreign Service officer told me. ‘‘The 
lack of a strategy continues to be the most 
dangerous thing we can do in the Middle 
East.’’ 
A former high-ranking State Department 
official expressed similar dismay. ‘‘Foreign 
policy isn’t well-done on impulse. Because so 
much is intertwined . . . . It requires the 
ability to understand the trade-offs and pos-
sible longer-term impacts. Never easy. But 
this team has no ability to do that,’’ they 
told me. ‘‘If I were a military family mem-
ber, I’d really worry that our troops are 
being sent out with no clear plan or mission. 
Not a comforting thought.’’ 
If Trump really does have an appetite for 
diplomacy, that’s undeniably a positive de-
velopment. Diplomats stress that now is the 
time for it, and the Iranians do seem to be 
signaling a desire deescalate. ‘‘Now we’re in 
the time of intense diplomacy, where around 
the world leaders are figuring out, ‘If you do 
this, I do that’ and ’What will be the re-
sponse of X if we do Y,’ ’’ a former senior U.S. 
official told me. But, this person added, ‘‘The 
only ones not taking part are the Ameri-
cans.’’ Instead, ‘‘America is content with a 
two-dimensional policy: We take this act, we 
stand still and watch what happens. The 
other countries are at least trying to be 
three-dimensional, adding the element of 
time, projecting to the not-too-distant fu-
ture which advantages are to be gained.’’ 
In an ideal world, Burns said, Trump would 
open 
a 
reliable 
diplomatic 
channel 
to 
Tehran. ‘‘We should want to be able to de-
liver tough and clear messages to its govern-
ment. And it would be smart to offer Iran a 
diplomatic off-ramp so that we can end the 
possibility of a wider war that is in neither 
of our interests,’’ he said. ‘‘Trump’s disin-
terest in real diplomacy is a significant dis-
advantage for the U.S.’’ 
Confronting a president who has repeat-
edly demonstrated a desire to dive into mili-
tary conflict before diplomacy, Congress is 
grappling with how to restrain Trump. Cali-
fornia congressman Ro Khanna told me the 
attacks on Tuesday increase ‘‘the urgency 
for Congress to act. We need to engage in de- 
escalation and a cease-fire to end the cycle 
of violence.’’ Currently on the table are a few 
measures House Democrats hope can curb 
Trump’s authority to attack Iran. Among 
them are a War Powers Resolution and a bill 
drafted by Khanna and Senator Bernie Sand-
ers that would defund any offensive action in 
Iran and require any such action to have 
Congressional authorization. 
Khanna told me that the Democratic cau-
cus is unified and that he has been in talks 
with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about timing and 
process. The House is expected to vote on a 
War Powers Resolution, after which they 
would push his bill with Senator Sanders. 
Currently, House leadership is figuring how 
to craft a War Powers Resolution in a way 
that would prevent Republicans from attach-
ing a Motion to Recommit, which could pre-
vent it from reaching the Senate floor—as 
was the case with the War Powers Resolution 
on Yemen. ‘‘That is why it is taking some 
time,’’ Khanna explained. ‘‘It is taking time 
to figure out the procedural mechanisms 
with the parliamentarian in the House and 
the Senate so that what we send over to the 
Senate doesn’t lose its War Powers privi-
leged status. If it loses its privileged status, 
then [Mitch] McConnell would never call it 
up.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to respond to the gentlewoman. I 
urge the gentlewoman, who read a cou-
ple of lines from the resolution, as I 
urge all of my colleagues, to read the 
entire resolution. 
This is pretty simple. Basically, it 
says that if we go to war with Iran, 
Congress ought to have a say in it. 
Congress ought to do what the Con-
stitution requires us to do. 
I don’t know why that is a radical 
idea, but if my friends want to go to 
war with Iran, they have to have the 
guts to come to the floor to debate it 
and vote on it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
the President cannot unilaterally go to 
war with Iran, nor are we safer since 
January 2, 2020, after having targeted 
and killed the second-in-command of 
Iran. The American people, as well as 
our troops, are in more jeopardy. 
In 2002, I was here, and I offer these 
words from my statement on the floor 
regarding President Bush. ‘‘Always a 
question of the greatest importance, 
our decision today,’’ in 2002, ‘‘is further 
weighted by the fact that we are being 
asked to sanction a new foreign policy 
doctrine that gives a President the 
power to launch a unilateral and pre-
emptive first strike against Iraq before 
we have utilized our diplomatic op-
tions.’’ 
I further went on to say that ‘‘our 
own intelligence agencies report that 
there is currently little chance of 
chemical and biological attack from 
Saddam Hussein on U.S. forces or terri-
tories.’’ 
Proven right, endless war, contin-
uous loss of life of our treasured young 
men and women and many injured— 
this resolution and rule are imperative 
to assert constitutional authority to 
ensure the protection of the American 
people. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT), a valuable 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I join my colleagues in expressing the 
will to have an honest debate of the 
War Powers Act, should the majority 
party choose to do so. 
Before I move any further, I submit 
for the RECORD a report from the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence on Barack 
Obama’s use of drones, an average of 67 
drone strikes a year over his first 7 
years in office, killing an average of six 
enemy combatants a week, wherein the 
majority said absolutely nothing about 
it at the time. 
SUMMARY
OF INFORMATION REGARDING U.S. 
COUNTERTERRORISM
STRIKES
OUTSIDE 
AREAS OF ACTIVE HOSTILITIES 
In accordance with the President’s direc-
tion and consistent with the President’s 
commitment to providing as much informa-
tion as possible to the American people 
about U.S. counterterrorism activities, the 
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is re-
leasing today a summary of information pro-
vided to the DNI about both the number of 
strikes taken by the U.S. Government 
against terrorist targets outside areas of ac-
tive hostilities and the assessed number of 
combatant and non-combatant deaths result-
ing from those strikes. ‘‘Areas of active hos-
tilities’’ currently include Afghanistan, Iraq, 
and Syria.

governmental organizations. The assessed 
range of non-combatant deaths includes 
deaths for which there is an insufficient 
basis for assessing that the deceased is a 
combatant. 
U.S. GOVERNMENT POST-STRIKE REVIEW 
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES 
The information that was provided to the 
DNI regarding combatant and non-combat-
ant deaths is the result of processes that in-
clude careful reviews of all strikes after they 
are conducted to assess the effectiveness of 
operations. These review processes have 
evolved over time to ensure that they incor-
porate the best available all-source intel-
ligence, media reporting, and other informa-
tion and may result in reassessments of 
strikes if new information becomes available 
that alters the original judgment. The large 
volume of pre- and post-strike data available 
to the U.S. Government can enable analysts 
to distinguish combatants from non-combat-
ants, conduct detailed battle damage assess-
ments, and separate reliable reporting from 
terrorist propaganda or from media reports 
that may be based on inaccurate informa-
tion. 
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN U.S. GOVERNMENT 
AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ASSESSMENTS 
In releasing these figures, the U.S. Govern-
ment acknowledges that there are dif-
ferences between U.S. Government assess-
ments and reporting from non-governmental 
organizations. 
Reports 
from 
non-govern-
mental organizations can include both aggre-
gate data regarding non-combatant deaths as 
well as case studies addressing particular 
strikes, and generally rely on a combination 
of media reporting and, in some instances, 
field research conducted in areas of reported 
strikes. Although these organizations’ re-
ports of non-combatant deaths resulting 
from U.S. strikes against terrorist targets 
outside areas of active hostilities vary wide-
ly, such reporting generally estimates sig-
nificantly higher figures for non-combatant 
deaths than is indicated by U.S. Government 
information. For instance, for the period be-
tween January 20, 2009 and December 31, 2015, 
non-governmental organizations’ estimates 
range from more than 200 to slightly more 
than 900 possible non-combatant deaths out-
side areas of active hostilities. 
Consistent with the requirements applica-
ble to future reporting under Section 3(b) of 
the Executive Order ‘‘United States Policy 
on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address 
Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations In-
volving the Use of Force,’’ the information 
we are releasing today addresses general rea-
sons for discrepancies between post-strike 
assessments from the United States Govern-
ment and credible reporting from non-gov-
ernmental organizations regarding non-com-
batant deaths and does not address specific 
incidents. There are a number of possible 
reasons that these non-governmental organi-
zations’ reports of the number of noncombat-
ants killed may differ from the U.S. Govern-
ment assessments, based on the information 
provided to the DNI. 
First, although there are inherent limita-
tions on determining the precise number of 
combatant and non-combatant deaths, par-
ticularly when operating in non-permissive 
environments, the U.S. Government uses 
post-strike methodologies that have been re-
fined and honed over the years and that use 
information that is generally unavailable to 
non-governmental organizations. The U.S. 
Government draws on all available informa-
tion (including sensitive intelligence) to de-
termine whether an individual is part of a 
belligerent party fighting against the United 
States in an armed conflict, taking a direct 
part in hostilities against the United States, 
or otherwise targetable in the exercise of na-
tional self-defense. Thus, the U.S. Govern-
ment may have reliable information that 
certain individuals are combatants, but are 
being counted as non-combatants by non-
governmental organizations. For example, 
further analysis of an individual’s possible 
membership in an organized armed group 
may include, among other things: the extent 
to which an individual performs functions 
for the benefit of the group that are analo-
gous to those traditionally performed by 
members of a country’s armed forces; wheth-
er that person is carrying out or giving or-
ders to others within the group; or whether 
that person has undertaken certain acts that 
reliably connote meaningful integration into 
the group. 
Second, according to information provided 
to the DNI, U.S. Government post-strike re-
views involve the collection and analysis of 
multiple sources of intelligence before, dur-
ing, and after a strike, including video obser-
vations, human sources and assets, signals 
intelligence, 
geospatial 
intelligence, 
ac-
counts from local officials on the ground, 
and open source reporting. Information col-
lected before a strike is intended to provide 
clarity regarding the number of individuals 
at a strike location as well as whether the 
individuals are engaged in terrorist activity. 
Post-strike collection frequently enables 
U.S. Government analysts to confirm, among 
other things, the number of individuals 
killed as well as their combatant status. The 
information is then analyzed along with 
other all-source intelligence reporting. This 
combination of sources is unique and can 
provide insights that are likely unavailable 
to non-governmental organizations. 
Finally, non-governmental organizations’ 
reports of counterterrorism strikes attrib-
uted to the U.S. Government—particularly 
their 
identification 
of 
non-combatant 
deaths—may be further complicated by the 
deliberate spread of misinformation by some 
actors, including terrorist organizations, in 
local media reports on which some non-gov-
ernmental estimates rely. 
Although the U.S. Government has access 
to a wide range of information, the figures 
released today should be considered in light 
of the inherent limitations on the ability to 
determine the precise number of combatant 
and non-combatant deaths given the non- 
permissive environments in which these 
strikes often occur. The U.S. Government re-
mains committed to considering new, cred-
ible information regarding non-combatant 
deaths that may emerge and revising pre-
vious assessments, as appropriate. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, if we want to have an 
honest debate about the War Powers 
Act, then let’s have an honest debate 
about the War Powers Act. 
Why didn’t we hear anything from 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle 
about 
Libya 
when 
President 
Barack Obama took action that led to 
the death of Muammar Qadhafi? Why 
not Syria? Why not Yemen? Why is 
Iran individually spelled out in this 
resolution? 
The only reason Iran is singled out in 
this resolution is to take a political jab 
at President Trump for utilizing an air-
strike to take out General Soleimani, a 
terrorist who was responsible for kill-
ing thousands of Americans, partner 
troops, and, yes, Iranians. 
While our colleagues are upset with 
the use of airstrikes to kill General 
Soleimani, I remind them that the 
Obama administration, according to 
their own Director of National Intel-
ligence, conducted hundreds of air-
strikes, averaging more than six kills a 
week between January 2009 and Decem-
ber 2015, and that was in areas of non-
hostilities. That doesn’t even include 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, which are 
classified numbers. 
Let’s just be honest about what this 
is. This is another partisan attack 
against the President of the United 
States for killing General Soleimani, 
who was a terrorist in an area where 
the President had the absolute legal 
authority to operate. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to respond to the gentleman from 
Georgia, who I have a great deal of re-
spect for. 
Let’s be honest here. Many of us, 
contrary to what the gentleman just 
said, have been outspoken against uni-
lateral interventions by the executive 
branch without notifying Congress, 
without seeking our approval on mili-
tary authorization under Obama. I, for 
one, was critical of his drone attacks. I 
raised issues about our involvement in 
Syria. 
I include in the RECORD a statement 
that I made, saying that Congress 
should reconvene and debate and vote 
on a resolution with regard to what the 
Obama administration was doing in 
Libya. 
[Press Release, March 23, 2011] 
CONGRESSMAN MCGOVERN STATEMENT ON 
LIBYA 
WASHINGTON, DC.—For several weeks now I 
have been calling for an internationally-en-
forced no-fly-zone over Libya in order to pre-
vent Colonel Qadaffi from slaughtering his 
own people. I agree with President Obama 
that U.S. ground troops should not be com-
mitted to this effort, and that our inter-
national partners should soon take the lead. 
Whether or not Qadaffi remains the leader of 
Libya must, in the end, be up to the Libyan 
people. I am troubled about pressure to ex-
pand the military operation and the many 
unanswered questions about Libyan opposi-
tion forces. I urge the House leadership to 
call the Congress back into session as soon 
as possible so that Congress can exercise its 
constitutional responsibility to clearly spell 
out the mission and limits of U.S. military 
engagement in Libya. And I urge the Obama 
Administration to consult with Congress and 
to engage us at every possible opportunity as 
this crisis continues to unfold. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
some of us have been consistent on this 
through Democratic and Republican 
administrations. I take great exception 
when anybody tries to say that we are 
raising this issue just purely for polit-
ical purposes. 
For me, it is not. For me, I have been 
consistent on this through Democratic 
and Republican administrations.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I

of military force has been an issue that 
a number of us have been concerned 
with, Republican and Democrat, going 
back to the Clinton administration and 
activity in the Balkans, but what my 
friend from Massachusetts pointed out 
is that this reckless act by the Presi-
dent of the United States actually 
makes us less safe. 
With one act, he has been able to 
unite the opposition in Iran. Remem-
ber, they were demonstrating in the 
streets against the regime. And I have 
heard from friends of mine who have 
deep roots in Iran that this has prob-
ably set back the cause of reform 
years, if not decades, in Iran. 
We are less safe, not more. 
I strongly urge the approval of this 
resolution as a start to rein in the 
President’s worst impulses, but we 
must also put in additional checks, by 
passing Representative KHANNA’s legis-
lation to ensure no funds are used for 
an unauthorized war with Iran and 
Representative LEE’s legislation to re-
peal the 2002 AUMF. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
this is an opportunity for us to get it 
right. And to take our friend, Mr. 
COLE’s, word, we can move this for-
ward. I see this as a beginning, and we 
can build on it, but rein in this admin-
istration. 
Send a strong signal. Approve this 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire the amount of time remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 12 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 133⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), a valuable 
member of the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this resolution is in-
sincere and unserious. It is insincere 
because this is just: We don’t like the 
President and he took action, and we 
can’t stand it. 
It is unserious, because if they really 
wanted to limit the actions of our gov-
ernment to defend our country and de-
fend those in uniform, this wouldn’t be 
a nonbinding resolution, they would 
limit it. If they want to limit it, go 
ahead and do it. 
For the people in America that say, 
‘‘Well, we don’t know this Soleimani 
guy. How come we don’t know him?’’ 
That is a great question. How come 
they don’t know? 
Well, let me introduce folks to him. 
He got busy with his work as a ter-
rorist in Beirut, killing 241 marines; 
the Khobar Towers, killing Americans; 
hundreds of American personnel wear-
ing uniforms dead by EFPs, explosively 
formed 
penetrators; 
and 
thousands 
maimed walking around the United 
States, walking around the Halls of 
this Congress. That is Soleimani. 
But they don’t know him because 
this body, the executive branch, Repub-
licans and Democrats, have sent their 
young men and women to war without 
dealing with this killer, this terrorist, 
because it was too hard, too hard in 
Iraq to deal with Iran, because it might 
make them mad, they might do some-
thing about it. 
Our colleagues say that the President 
is reckless, without a plan. 
Here is what is reckless: appease-
ment. Appeasement has gotten Ameri-
cans killed, has gotten people around 
the globe killed because of this guy. 
What is the point of designating him a 
terrorist if you are not going to do 
anything about it? 
Doing the bidding of Iran on this 
floor is unacceptable. We don’t want to 
be in a war, that is true, nobody wants 
to be in a war, but I have got a news 
flash for everybody: Iran slapped us in 
the face in 1979 and they have been 
fighting with us ever since. 
Us saying we are not going to defend 
ourselves does not stop Iran from fight-
ing the war that they have with us. Ap-
peasing Iran will only kill more Ameri-
cans. It hasn’t worked. 
That is what is happening here 
today, Madam Speaker: the defense of 
the appeasement strategy of the last 
administration and administrations in 
the past. 
We cannot allow this strategy to con-
tinue and Americans to be killed or 
Iran to have a nuclear weapon. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just urge my colleagues to read 
the resolution. This is about the future 
and it is about whether or not, if we go 
to war with Iran, whether or not Con-
gress upholds its constitutional respon-
sibility. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. 
WELCH). 
Mr. 
WELCH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The President’s policy towards Iran 
is to tear up diplomacy and embrace 
so-called maximum pressure. 
The most recent strike, far from 
making us safer, is making us more in-
secure. 
Think about the deliberate con-
sequences from that act: 
One, 
the 
Iraqi 
street 
is 
dem-
onstrating 
against 
the 
U.S., 
not 
against Iran, as they were before; 
Two, the Iranian street is dem-
onstrating with the mullahs against 
the U.S. instead of against their own 
government; 
Three, the Iraqi parliament voted to 
expel the United States from Iraq, 
jeopardizing our anti-ISIS mission; 
Number four, our military has sus-
pended training for anti-ISIS activities 
in Iraq because of this strike; 
Number five, the Iran nuclear deal 
that the President tore up that Ira-
nians complied with, they are now re-
nouncing, so we are closer to a nuclear 
Iran than we were before. 
All of this has happened when the 
likelihood of Iran’s further responding 
is grave. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, the 
gun is cocked and loaded. 
We cannot go to war without Con-
gress being involved in the debate and 
the President telling us what his policy 
is going to be. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to provide for imme-
diate consideration of H. Res. 783, hon-
oring the members of the military and 
intelligence community for carrying 
out the mission that killed General 
Soleimani. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of this 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW), my good friend, 
to explain the resolution. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise to urge defeat of the previous 
question so that we can immediately 
consider my resolution to honor the 
hard work and dedication of the men 
and women who made the precision 
strike on Qasem Soleimani possible. 
This is an interesting crossroads we 
find ourselves in. After the successful 
response by the United States against 
the escalating aggression from the 
world’s most active and deadly ter-
rorist, Qasem Soleimani, our great 
country has found itself divided and 
unsure of itself. 
Instead of unity and resolve in the 
face of a clear and common enemy, we 
have division and self-doubt. What is 
worse, that division has been sourced 
from the leadership in this very body. 
While 
legitimate 
questions 
were 
raised—what authority was used, what 
was the reasoning, what sort of intel-
ligence backed this decision—those 
questions have long been answered 
clearly and convincingly. 
The President has clear authority, a 
duty in fact, to respond to attacks 
against American citizens and U.S. 
forces. That isn’t my opinion; that is 
clear from Article II of the Constitu-
tion and the War Powers Resolution. 
The case is made even stronger when 
you consider this occurred entirely 
within Iraq, a place where we already 
have a lawful military operational 
footprint.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H86 
January 9, 2020 
The reasoning is quite simple as well: 
We must make clear that the U.S. will 
not be attacked indefinitely, that we 
will respond, and that response will 
make you regret ever having hit us in 
the first place. 
The 
long 
history 
of 
General 
Soleimani’s actions against the United 
States throughout the region, and the 
killing and maiming of thousands of 
America’s sons and daughters, and in-
dications of his future actions make 
this point even stronger. 
As to the intelligence, our CIA, our 
Director of National Intelligence, our 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
have repeatedly told us that this intel-
ligence was some of the best they had 
ever seen, and it removed all doubt 
that Soleimani was planning large 
scale imminent attacks. 
These questions have been answered 
over and over and over, and yet my col-
leagues pretend not to hear those an-
swers. After all, the mere thought of 
agreeing 
with 
and 
supporting 
our 
President is repugnant to them even 
when it is the right thing to do. 
So instead of applauding these ac-
tions that restored American deter-
rence, delivered justice to hundreds of 
dead American soldiers and their fami-
lies, and severely weakened the ter-
rorist organization IRGC Quds Force, 
my colleagues wring their hands and 
express regret and disappointment. 
Instead of applauding the men and 
women of our military standing in 
harm’s way, instead of recognizing the 
tireless vigilance of our intelligence 
community, instead of acknowledging 
those who have spent years confronting 
the Iranian threat network directly, 
my colleagues in this Congress seek to 
undermine them. 
I take this personally, since I was 
one of those servicemembers for so 
many years. 
This threat is not new to us, though 
it may be new to those politicians who 
have lived comfortably and safely back 
home, now casting stones from ivory 
towers, relying on disingenuous judg-
ments and false premises to make a 
false, politically-driven case to the 
American people. 
So I offer this resolution today in 
order to right that wrong. I offer this 
to demonstrate to the American people 
and our servicemembers and members 
of the intelligence community that 
this Congress does indeed stand by the 
decision to rid the world of America’s 
enemies and those who seek to do us 
harm and stands by those who made 
justice possible. 
This resolution simply states the ob-
vious: that General Soleimani was head 
of one of the most sophisticated ter-
rorist organizations in the world that 
already committed numerous attacks 
against the United States and planned 
to carry out many more within days. 
This resolution rightfully congratu-
lates our men and women who dis-
rupted this evil chain of attacks, in-
stead of wrongly suggesting to them 
that their actions were unauthorized 
and even immoral. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
ask my colleagues to support this reso-
lution and put to rest once and for all 
the false implication that America 
cannot defend herself when necessary. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, late 
last week, President Trump ordered 
the assassination of a high-ranking Ira-
nian official while he was in Iraq. 
This action threatens to cascade the 
United States into an ill-advised, not 
authorized war with Iran, and is al-
ready setting into motion a series of 
disastrous unintended consequences for 
American security and interests in the 
Middle East. 
The President trashed the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action, which 
Iran was following and that put in 
place the first real restraints on Iran’s 
nuclear program. The world and Amer-
ica were safer under the JCPOA frame-
work, period. 
Enter Trump, and now we see Iranian 
rockets firing, U.S. forces being pushed 
out of Iraq, and alliances strained as 
we all await further retaliations. 
Oh, history is replete with the misery 
befalling those poor empires who first 
fight and mistake that for might. 
This escalation with Iran must end, 
Congress must reassert its war powers 
authority, and I urge adoption of the 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER), a valuable 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and the Committee on 
Armed Forces. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Sometimes when I watch the debate, 
I wonder what happened to the con-
fident America that I remember; that 
when a failing country threatens us, we 
actually respond with force instead of 
fear and run away. 
That said, this process argument 
that we are having is interesting, but 
as my colleague said earlier, maybe 
they forgot something. 
So I am going to urge defeat of the 
previous question, because I think in 
this resolution, something major was 
forgotten, maybe they can re-craft it, 
bring it back later, but that is this: I 
hear my friends on the other side of the 
aisle say that Mr. Soleimani was a bad 
guy and they are glad he is dead. How-
ever—process 
argument 
follows—I 
think something has been left out of 
this. 
When I was in Iraq in 2008 and 2009, I 
operated mostly against terrorist net-
works of a different nature, but about 
a 
quarter 
of 
my 
operations 
were 
against terrorist networks from Mr. 
Soleimani. 
So these attacks against Americans, 
we talked about the dead Americans 
from Iraq, these have been going on for 
a very long time, and I was part of the 
response to that. 
One of the most important things we 
can do, if we are going to have this 
process argument, is appreciate the 
men and women, not just of the mili-
tary, but of the intelligence commu-
nity, of the State Department, of ev-
erywhere that has worked to bring the 
intelligence to bring this evil man to 
justice. 
I heard somebody earlier say we 
should have just captured him. Well, 
think of the risk that would have put 
to our military. So maybe we should at 
least appreciate the job that they are 
willing to do. That is going to be essen-
tial. 
I often hear my friends talk about 
keeping the military safe, as if that is 
the end state of the military. 
The military’s job that they volun-
teer for every day is to keep the Amer-
ican people safe, and that is exactly 
what was done a week ago in the death 
of Soleimani. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
so that we can give them an oppor-
tunity and pass this resolution appre-
ciating the men and women of the in-
telligence community and the mili-
tary. That is the least we can do after 
this debate on the floor. 
b 1330 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, as a 
Member of Congress, I take my duty to 
protect and defend our Nation’s inter-
ests very seriously. The President’s 
reckless and irresponsible actions to-
ward Iran have endangered our service-
members, diplomats, and allies, and 
they have worked counter to American 
security interests. Those include dan-
gerous decisions to pull out of the suc-
cessful Iran deal and kill Commander 
Soleimani, drastically ratcheting up 
tensions in the region. 
In the context of the administra-
tion’s failure to demonstrate an immi-
nent threat to our Nation, there is no 
authority for such an action without 
authorization 
from 
Congress. 
What 
makes this even more dangerous is 
that the President has no clear strat-
egy. 
Under the Constitution, President 
Trump does not have the authority to 
unilaterally wage war. That is why, 
today, I support this rule and the un-
derlying resolution, which directs the 
President to end hostilities with Iran 
and to keep our troops in America safe. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, Qasem 
Soleimani, as we have discussed, many 
of us have discussed here today, was a

terrorist and a terrorist supporter, and 
hundreds of American troops were 
killed because of him. Many of them 
are scarred for life. 
I don’t think we can overstate, in 
this body, how gruesome, how ad-
vanced, how effective the explosive de-
vices that he poured into his militias 
were. They were deadly. They were 
manufactured in Iran. They were put in 
place by Iran. They were trained by 
Iran. They had the capability to com-
pletely penetrate our armored vehicles. 
Soleimani worked hand in hand, in 
addition to this, with Assad in Syria, a 
serial human rights abuser, and waged 
even chemical warfare on his own peo-
ple, literally killing tens of thousands. 
And because of him, today, hundreds, if 
not thousands, of families, including 
Gold Star families, just this past holi-
day, couldn’t open up presents with 
their loved ones. No longer will they 
celebrate birthdays or holidays because 
of this one evil man. 
This terrorist, because of his savage 
actions, I, as a former Green Beret who 
operated against these thugs for years, 
am grateful to the intelligence officer, 
as my colleague Mr. KINZINGER just 
mentioned, to the members of the mili-
tary who carried out this mission to 
prevent more lives from being lost. 
Soleimani was actively planning at-
tacks in the coming weeks, in the com-
ing days, in the coming months. Ac-
cording to the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, these attacks were im-
minent, they were clear, and they were 
a present danger for our troops, to our 
allies, and to our interests. 
From an oversight perspective, the 
President had a duty to act; and I, for 
one, would be screaming from the roof-
tops if he had not taken appropriate 
action. 
So, again, Madam Speaker, I am 
thankful for his leadership taking this 
monster out. Frankly, this should have 
been done a long, long time ago, years 
ago, by multiple previous administra-
tions. It astounds me that this is up for 
debate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida an 
additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. WALTZ. For those of you saying 
actions have consequences, let me re-
mind you that inaction has con-
sequences. Go to Walter Reed or Ar-
lington, or go visit the American con-
tractor, as though that is some kind of 
term, the American that was killed 
just last week. His name was Nawres 
Waleed Hamid. He is from Sacramento. 
He is from California, and he was just 
buried. 
I think the answer for most Ameri-
cans is this was warranted. It certainly 
was for me. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
the previous question and consider this 
resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, the 
War Powers Resolution simply requires 
the President to consult with the Con-
gress and with the American public be-
fore going to war with Iran. 
Our constituents held their breath on 
Tuesday. Thankfully, no lives were lost 
in Iran’s retaliatory attack, but seri-
ous concerns remain about the ration-
ale and the ramifications. 
We do not mourn the loss of Qasem 
Soleimani. He was responsible for ac-
tions that harmed and killed American 
personnel and allies, and I condemn 
that. But any U.S. military action, es-
pecially one that could spark cata-
strophic consequences, needs to be 
carefully considered, fully justified 
within the law. 
President Trump failed to consult 
the Congress, failed to secure specific 
authorization, failed to cite with speci-
ficity the imminent threat. In a classi-
fied briefing for Members of Congress, 
the administration would not, could 
not provide any specifics about what 
constituted an imminent threat. They 
couldn’t tell us what the targets were, 
nor would they divulge any of the 
timelines for the attack. 
It is unprecedented the level at which 
this administration is seeking to ob-
scure the facts from the Congress and 
the American people. The rationale is 
in doubt, the ramifications as well: The 
U.S. announced it will suspend our 
fight against ISIS; Iraq’s Prime Min-
ister and the legislature moved to 
expel our troops; the Iranian leaders 
announced they would no longer abide 
by the 2015 nuclear deal. 
President Trump’s actions have dra-
matically increased the possibility of 
war with Iran and Iran’s pursuit of a 
nuclear weapon. Today, America and 
our allies are less safe as a result of the 
administration’s actions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut an additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. DELAURO. Let us reassert the 
Congress’ role to ensure that the Presi-
dent—any 
President—is 
complying 
with the law and is not conducting 
lengthy military actions without con-
gressional approval. 
Let us prevent another unnecessary 
war. Let us vote for this rule and this 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 1 minute re-
maining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a 
distinguished member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
Constitution gave Congress the power 
to declare war. The Constitution gave 
Congress the power appropriate money 
for war. The Constitution gave us the 
power to raise and support armies and 
to provide and maintain a Navy. 
Why? Why didn’t the Framers just 
give the President the power to declare 
and wage war? After all, the President 
is made Commander in Chief of the 
Army and Navy and militias when 
called into the actual service of the 
United States. It would have been a lot 
simpler to say let the President go to 
war whenever he wants. Why didn’t 
they do that? 
Well, the Framers acted against a 
background of kings and princes plung-
ing their populations into wars of van-
ity and political advantage to distract 
their people at home from the political 
problems of the kingdom, of the mon-
archy. And our Framers were emphatic 
that the awesome power of war, the 
power over life and death of our sons 
and daughters, the power over our na-
tional treasure not be vested in one 
man alone but, rather, in American de-
mocracy itself. 
The representatives of the people, the 
people of Maryland and Virginia and 
Florida and California and Idaho and 
Pennsylvania and Michigan and Alaska 
and Hawaii, that is who the Framers 
vested the power of war in: the Con-
gress of the United States. 
Now, the structural problem is that, 
if the Nation is actually attacked or 
there is an imminent attack coming, 
the President may need to respond in 
self-defense. Madison anticipated that, 
and Madison said that might happen. 
The Supreme Court, in 1863, in the 
middle of the Civil War, in the Prize 
Cases, said that the President can act 
in those situations. Lincoln embargoed 
and blockaded the Southern States, 
and that was attacked as unconstitu-
tional. They said, well, he was acting 
against a real, imminent threat to the 
land and the people of the country. 
Now, after the Vietnam war, Con-
gress passed the War Powers Resolu-
tion in 1973, providing the President 
may engage our forces in hostilities 
only with a declaration of war, a statu-
tory authorization, or a national emer-
gency created by an attack upon our 
people or our Armed Forces. 
Now, under the War Powers Act, the 
President must consult Congress if he 
thinks that he is acting in imminent 
self-defense of the country. The Presi-
dent didn’t do that. He talked to some 
other people at Mar-a-Lago. He never 
talked to the Congress of the United 
States officially, neither the Repub-
licans nor the Democrats. He didn’t 
contact the so-called Gang of Eight of 
our top leadership in the intelligence 
and security field. 
He did notify us, in fairness to the 
President, within 48 hours of his tar-
geted killing, which many see, under 
international law, as an act of war. 
At this point, though, whether you 
think there was truly an imminent cri-
sis and this was something like Pearl 
Harbor or you think that the President 
still has not given us a single compel-
ling justification for why he did it in

acting under imminent self-defense, 
you think it is more like Gulf of Ton-
kin, it doesn’t make any difference. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Maryland an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. RASKIN. All of us, everybody in 
this Chamber at this point should say 
that whatever imminent threat ex-
isted, whatever emergency there was is 
gone, and now this country should not 
go to war without a declaration of war 
by this Congress or statutory author-
ization, unless we are attacked in the 
meantime. 
That is the whole point of the War 
Powers Resolution, to enforce the pow-
ers of Congress. We represent the peo-
ple. We should not be going to war in 
the name of the United States based on 
the word of one man. That is not the 
constitutional design. It must be the 
Congress itself. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a January 3 CNN 
article, entitled, ‘‘Trump’s Huge Iran 
Gamble Will Have Lasting Impact.’’ 
[From CNN, Jan. 3, 2020] 
TRUMP’S HUGE IRAN GAMBLE WILL HAVE 
LASTING IMPACT 
(By Stephen Collinson) 
(CNN) President Donald Trump’s targeted 
killing of Iran’s ruthless military and intel-
ligence chief adds up to his most dangerous 
gamble yet with other peoples’ lives and his 
own political fate. 
By killing Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, 
Trump committed the United States to a 
risky open conflict that at best could stop 
short of all-out war with Iran that could 
cause national security and economic shocks 
in the United States and across the globe. 
The administration argues that it has 
taken one of the world’s worst mass mur-
derers and terrorists off the battlefield. But 
given Iran’s easy access to soft targets, the 
Middle East and even Europe suddenly look 
a lot less safe for Americans, including US 
troops Trump may be even more tempted to 
haul home. 
Two 
days 
into 
his 
re-election 
year, 
Trump—who rails against Middle Eastern en-
tanglements—has plunged the United States 
into another one, with vast and unknown 
consequences. It challenges a presidency 
that is already alienating half of his coun-
try, following his impeachment and unre-
strained behavior in office. Trump may find 
it impossible to rally the nation behind him 
to weather the crisis. He has also scrambled 
strategic and moral expectations of the 
United States—ordering the killing of a sen-
ior foreign leader of a nation with whom the 
US is not formally at war—albeit an official 
regarded by Washington as a terrorist. 
Reflecting the strike’s potential for esca-
lation, a US defense official said the admin-
istration would deploy a further 3,000 troops 
to the Middle East, including 750 who have 
already deployed to protect the US embassy 
in Baghdad. 
The reverberations of his act on Thursday 
will last for years. 
‘‘Iran never won a war, but never lost a ne-
gotiation!’’ Trump wrote on Friday morning 
in a tweet that will do nothing to calm crit-
ics who worry about the depth of his stra-
tegic thinking. 
It 
is 
too 
early 
to 
know 
whether 
Soleimani’s death will significantly weaken 
Iran and improve the US strategic position, 
whether it will ignite a regional conflagra-
tion and how it will eventually affect 
Trump’s political prospects and legacy. It is 
also unclear how it will change the political 
position inside Iran where the regime is be-
sieged by an economic crisis and recently 
crushed mass protests. 
But Iran will surely regard the killing of 
one of its most significant political leaders 
as an act of war, so its revenge is likely to 
be serious and long lasting. 
‘‘There are definitely going to be unin-
tended consequences, and for starters I think 
we better have our embassies pretty well 
buttoned down,’’ former US Ambassador to 
Iraq Christopher Hill told CNN. 
‘‘Iran simply cannot sit on its hands on 
this one. I think there will be a reaction and 
I’m afraid it could get bloody in places.’’ 
Trump supporters are celebrating their 
hard man commander-in-chief. They note 
that Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of 
hundreds of US soldiers in militia attacks 
during the Iraq War. But recent history is 
marked by spectacular US shock-and-awe 
opening acts of conflicts in Iraq and Afghani-
stan that cause short-term gloating and long 
term military and political disasters. A full- 
on conflict with Iran would be far more com-
plicated than those two wars. 
Trump’s strike may be the most signifi-
cant calculated US act in a 40-year Cold War 
with revolutionary Iran. It’s the biggest US 
foreign policy bet since the invasion of Iraq. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told 
CNN’s ‘‘New Day’’ that killing Soleimani 
‘‘saved American lives’’ and was based on 
‘‘imminent’’ threat intelligence about an at-
tack in the region. Trump echoed his sec-
retary 
of 
state 
later 
Friday 
morning, 
tweeting that Soleimani ‘‘was plotting to 
kill many more’’ Americans. 
But Pompeo refused to give further details. 
The political bar for an administration that 
has made a habit of disinformation and lying 
is going to be far higher than that in such a 
grave crisis. Eliminating the most powerful 
political force in Iran short of Supreme 
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also de-
stroys the chimera that this White House is 
not committed to a regime change strategy. 
Given Soleimani’s frequent travels to Iraq, 
Syria and other areas in the Middle East this 
is not the first time that he will have been 
in US crosshairs. But previous presidents, 
perhaps cognizant of the inflammatory con-
sequences, chose not to take the shot. In the 
coming days, the administration will have to 
explain why it acted now. 
The act also likely eliminates possibly for 
a generation, any hope that the United 
States and Iran can settle their differences 
by talking. There will be no desire nor polit-
ical capital for even Iranian officials often 
misleadingly described as moderates to sit 
down with US counterparts. 
When Trump took office, there was no im-
mediate crisis with Iran. The Islamic Repub-
lic was honoring the Obama administration’s 
nuclear deal though it had not stepped back 
from its missile development and what the 
US says is malignant activity in its own 
neighborhood. 
But by ripping up the deal, strangling the 
Iranian economy and now killing Soleimani, 
Trump now owns however the confrontation 
turns out. It’s a huge gamble because history 
suggests that Presidents who bet their ca-
reers on the jungle of Middle East politics al-
ways lose. 
The strike displays Trump’s growing in-
fatuation with wielding military power, ex-
acerbates a trend of unchecked presidential 
authority and forges the kind of ruthless vig-
ilante image he adores. 
The question is now whether Trump—an 
erratic, inexperienced leader who abhors ad-
vice and rarely thinks more than one step 
ahead—is equipped to handle such a perilous, 
enduring crisis. 
And is his administration, which seems 
bent on toppling Iran’s regime but cannot 
publicly come up with a plan for the after-
math, ready to handle an Iranian backlash in 
the region and beyond? 
Trump’s hubristic tweeting of a US flag 
following Soleimani’s death in a drone strike 
in Iraq but failure to explain to Americans 
what is going on may be a bad sign in this re-
gard. 
But despite a stream of instant Twitter 
analysis from pundits suddenly expert in Ira-
nian affairs, no one can be sure what will 
happen next. That’s what makes Trump’s 
strike 
so 
unpredictable 
and 
potentially 
dicey. 
With the vast network of proxies from 
Hezbollah to Hamas, Iran has the capacity to 
strike fast and hard against US allies like 
Israel and Saudi Arabia and US assets and 
personnel in its region. It could hammer the 
global economy by attacking oil tankers in 
the Strait of Hormuz. US officials and top 
military officers may be more exposed when 
they travel abroad. Iran could explode Leb-
anon’s fragile political compact and causes 
region-wide shocks. 
US troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan 
look especially vulnerable to action by Ira-
nian-allied forces. Politically, the Baghdad 
government may have no choice but to ask 
American forces to leave after the attack in 
a scenario that could effectively deliver the 
country to Iran’s influence or retrigger its 
terrible civil war. 
The killing of Soleimani is a massive sym-
bolic blow to Iran. He was the Godfather of 
the Middle East who masterminded the coun-
try’s huge regional influence. 
Pompeo claimed that his demise will be 
greeted by Iraqis and Iranians as a blow for 
freedom and a sign the United States is on 
their side. But developments in Middle East-
ern politics rarely mirror the optimistic pro-
nouncements of US officials. 
DID THE US INFLICT A SERIOUS STRATEGIC BLOW 
ON IRAN? 
Analysts will be looking to see whether the 
death of Soleimani robs the Quds force of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps of its 
coherence and dims its regional power at 
least at first. 
Tehran’s strategic response is unclear. 
While it could lash out, a wave of attacks 
against US soldiers or terrorist strikes else-
where may draw it into a direct conflict with 
a more powerful rival, the United States 
that it does not seek. 
It is not certain that it will strike back 
quickly. It may have more to gain from 
making life intolerable for the United States 
and its citizens in the region in a slow burn 
approach. 
Trump could be especially exposed to a 
such a military or economic backlash by 
Iran that casts doubt on his judgment given 
his quickening reelection race. 
His move against Iran could also reshape 
the dynamics of the presidential election 
race at home, by opening a lane for Demo-
crats to run as anti-war candidates against 
him—a position that helped the last two 
presidents—Trump and Barack Obama—get 
elected. 
Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders on 
Friday released a video vowing to do every-
thing he can ‘‘to prevent a war with Iran.’’ 
‘‘Because if you think the war in Iraq was 
a disaster, my guess is that the war in Iran 
would be even worse,’’ the Vermont senator 
said. 
And Democratic front-runner Joe Biden 
immediately swung into sober commander- 
in-chief mode, positioning himself to profit 
politically if Trump’s Iran venture backfires.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H89 
January 9, 2020 
The former vice president offered testi-
mony to Soleimani’s record of fomenting 
bloodshed and instability but added: ‘‘Presi-
dent Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite 
into a tinderbox.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H. Con. Res. 83. 
Our single greatest responsibility is 
the safety and security of the Amer-
ican people; and as the elected rep-
resentatives of the American people, it 
is our solemn duty to ensure that our 
country only engages in armed conflict 
that is necessary and that, when we do, 
there are clear objectives and a strat-
egy for achieving those objectives. 
The Trump administration has pre-
sented neither evidence that military 
action is necessary nor a clear outline 
of their goals and a strategy with re-
spect to Iran. 
Any decision to put American troops 
in harm’s way should be debated open-
ly and honestly so that the American 
people have a say in their future. Noth-
ing in this resolution prevents the ad-
ministration from seeking authoriza-
tion for future actions, but it does 
guarantee, as the Constitution re-
quires, 
that 
the 
American 
people, 
through their elected representatives, 
have a voice in that decision. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I was in the class of 
Congress that was elected right after 
September 11, 2001, that came into of-
fice in 2003. 
After coming to office, through press 
reports and information in various con-
gressional hearings, we got informa-
tion that Osama bin Laden had de-
clared war on the United States in 
1997—I did not know that—and that 
there had been actionable intelligence 
and Osama bin Laden could have been 
taken out prior to the attack of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, but the administration 
in the 1990s decided not to do so. 
Now, yesterday, fast-forwarding to 
present time, we heard from General 
Mark Milley clear, unambiguous intel-
ligence indicating a significant cam-
paign of violence against the United 
States in the days, weeks, and months 
that the administration would have 
been culpably negligent if it did not 
act, all in regards to the killing of Gen-
eral Soleimani. 
b 1345 
The President wants to keep the 
country safe. The President showed re-
markable restraint, I thought, yester-
day, and I thought the tone in his ad-
dress to the Nation yesterday was pre-
cisely the right tone. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administration 
Policy. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H. CON. RES. 83—DIRECTING
THE
PRESIDENT 
PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(C) OF THE WAR POW-
ERS RESOLUTION TO TERMINATE THE USE OF 
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO ENGAGE IN 
HOSTILITIES
IN
OR
AGAINST
IRAN—REP. 
SLOTKIN, D–MI, AND 134 COSPONSORS 
The Administration strongly opposes pas-
sage of H. Con. Res. 83, which purports to di-
rect the President to terminate the use of 
United States Armed Forces engaged in hos-
tilities in or against Iran or any part of its 
government or military unless authorized by 
Congress. 
At the President’s direction, on January 2, 
the United States military successfully exe-
cuted a strike in Iraq that killed Qassem 
Soleimani, the Commander of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, a 
designated foreign terrorist organization. 
Soleimani was personally responsible for ter-
rible atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, 
including Hezbollah, launching terror strikes 
against civilian targets. He fueled bloody 
civil wars all across the region. He directed 
and facilitated actions that viciously wound-
ed and murdered thousands of United States 
troops, including by planting bombs that 
maim and dismember their victims. In elimi-
nating Soleimani from the battlefield, the 
President took action to stop a war, not to 
start a war. He took action to protect our 
diplomats, our service members, our allies, 
and all Americans. 
Although concurrent resolutions like H. 
Con. Res. 83 lack the force of law under con-
trolling Supreme Court precedent, I.N.S. v. 
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), it is nevertheless 
important to highlight some of its defi-
ciencies. 
First, H. Con. Res. 83 is unnecessary be-
cause the military actions to which it ap-
plies are already authorized by law, includ-
ing the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public 
Law 107–243) (‘‘2002 AUMF’’). The 2002 AUMF 
provides specific statutory authorization to 
engage in military action to ‘‘defend the na-
tional security of the United States against 
the continuing threat posed by Iraq.’’ Public 
Law 107–243, § 3(a)(1). The United States 
forces that have been threatened by Iranian 
and Iran-backed attacks in Iraq are there to 
combat terrorist groups—such as ISIS. Thus, 
in addition to acting in accordance with his 
Constitutional authorities as Commander in 
Chief and Chief Executive, the President also 
acted against Soleimani pursuant to existing 
statutory authorization. The 2002 AUMF has 
always been understood to authorize the use 
of force for, among other purposes, address-
ing terrorist threats—like Soleimani and the 
attacks he was planning and facilitating— 
emanating from Iraq. This is consistent with 
actions taken by previous Presidents pursu-
ant to the 2002 AUMF. For example, during 
the last administration, United States forces 
frequently conducted operations in response 
to attacks and threats by Iran-backed mili-
tias in Iraq under the authority conferred by 
the 2002 AUMF. Moreover, the Administra-
tion’s engagement with Congress on this 
strike has been fully in accordance with past 
precedent, including by providing notifica-
tion consistent with the War Powers Resolu-
tion and by briefing Congressional leader-
ship, the full membership of the House and 
Senate, and appropriate staff. 
Second, were provisions like those in-
cluded in H. Con. Res. 83 to become law, they 
could undermine the President’s ability to 
defend United States forces and interests in 
the region against ongoing threats from Iran 
and its proxies. Iran has a long history of at-
tacking United States and coalition forces 
both directly and through its proxies, includ-
ing, most recently, by means of a January 7 
missile attack from Iran against United 
States forces stationed at two bases in Iraq. 
Over the last several months, Soleimani 
planned and supported these escalating at-
tacks 
by 
Iranian-directed 
Shia 
militia 
groups on coalition bases throughout Iraq. 
He orchestrated the December 27, 2019 attack 
on an Iraqi military base, which resulted in 
the death of a United States citizen and 
badly wounded four United States service 
members. Soleimani also approved the subse-
quent attack later that month on the United 
States Embassy in Baghdad, which turned 
violent and damaged the Embassy facility. 
At the time of the January 2 strike, 
Soleimani was in Iraq in violation of a 
United Nations Security Council travel ban 
and was actively developing plans to immi-
nently attack United States diplomats and 
service members in Iraq and throughout the 
region. Subsequently, Iran launched an at-
tack against the United States. Were Con-
gress to attempt to compel the President to 
adhere to a resolution like H. Con. Res. 83, it 
could hinder the President’s ability to pro-
tect United States forces and interests in the 
region from the continued threat posed by 
Iran and its proxies. 
This concurrent resolution is misguided, 
and its adoption by Congress could under-
mine the ability of the United States to pro-
tect American citizens whom Iran continues 
to seek to harm. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous ques-
tion, ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I think what the 
President did was a grave miscalcula-
tion, but we can’t change the past. We 
can only shape the future. 
I have raised concerns about execu-
tive overreach during the Bush admin-
istration; I raised them during the 
Obama administration; and today, I am 
here to raise those concerns about the 
Trump administration. 
I hope there is no war with Iran, but 
we have seen that developments can 
change day by day, hour by hour. 
Should tensions escalate again, Con-
gress should have a say before hos-
tilities are launched. It is really that 
simple. 
This should be the easiest vote in the 
world for Members of Congress. Re-
gardless of what you think about what 
the President has done, regardless 
whether you agree with his policies or 
not, and regardless of your political af-
filiation, this is about ensuring that we 
have a say about what may come next. 
There is nothing radical about this. 
The Constitution gives only Congress 
the ability to declare war. Let’s re-
claim our power and let’s do our jobs. 
My friends say they want to honor 
our troops. Well, talk is cheap. How 
about honoring our troops by doing our 
job, by living up to our constitutional 
responsibilities. War is a big deal. We 
ought to take it seriously here. I and 
some of my Republican friends over the 
years have raised issues with Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations 
about the ease in which they commit 
our troops to hostilities. Enough is 
enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H90 
January 9, 2020 
No more endless wars. Congress has 
to live up to its constitutional respon-
sibility. Let’s reclaim our power. Let’s 
do our job. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Committees on 
the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, as a 
member serving in this body on September 
11, 2001 and throughout the fateful and tragic 
war in Iraq, and as an original cosponsor, I 
rise in strong support of the rule governing de-
bate of H. Con. Res. 83, a concurrent resolu-
tion directing the President to terminate the 
engagement of United States Armed Forces in 
hostilities in or against Iran, as well as the un-
derlying legislation. 
I thank the gentlelady from Michigan, Con-
gresswoman ELISSA SLOTKIN, for introducing 
this resolution and Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chair ELIOT ENGEL for his work on this impor-
tant resolution. 
I also thank Speaker PELOSI for taking swift 
action to afford the House the opportunity to 
honor its constitutional duty to keep the Amer-
ican people safe by limiting the President from 
taking further precipitous military actions re-
garding Iran. 
We know from bitter and heart-breaking ex-
perience the truth that while dangerous and 
bloody battles are fought by the military, it is 
the nation that goes to war. 
And that is why the Framers lodged the 
awesome power to declare and take the na-
tion to war not in the hands of a single indi-
vidual, but through Article I, Section, clause 11 
in the collective judgment of Congress, the 
representatives of the American people. 
It is true of course that the United States 
has an inherent right to self-defense against 
imminent armed attacks and that it maintains 
the right to ensure the safety of diplomatic 
personnel serving abroad. 
But in matters of imminent armed attacks, 
the executive branch must inform Congress as 
to why military action was necessary within a 
certain window of opportunity, the possible 
harm that missing the window would cause, 
and why the action was likely to prevent future 
disastrous attacks against the United States. 
Only after being fully briefed and informed is 
the Congress in a position to validate and rat-
ify or disapprove and terminate the action. 
Madam Speaker, Section 5(c) of the 1973 
War Power Resolution, Pub. L. 93–148, pro-
vides that whenever ‘‘United States Armed 
Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the 
territory of the United States, its possessions 
and territories without a declaration of war or 
specific statutory authorization, such forces 
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs by concurrent resolution.’’ 
The military action ordered on Friday, Janu-
ary 3, 2020 by the President to kill Major Gen-
eral Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Is-
lamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, may have 
rid the world of a major architect of terror but 
leaves unanswered the critically important 
question of why the action was taken at that 
time. 
Even at this late hour, members of Con-
gress have not been briefed or been shown 
compelling evidence by the Administration that 
the action was necessary to repel a credible, 
certain, and imminent attack on the United 
States, its allies, or American civilians or mili-
tary personnel. 
The Administration has yet to provide proof 
or assuage the concerns of most member of 
Congress, and of the American people, that 
the killing of Major General Soleimani was a 
necessary action that was the product of a 
carefully crafted geopolitical strategy devel-
oped after extensive discussion within the na-
tional security apparatus regarding the short 
and long-term consequences for the security 
of the region and our nation and its people. 
Similarly, we do not know whether the deci-
sion to engage in the hostile action against 
Iran was made by the President in consulta-
tion and agreement with our regional and 
international allies and whether there is now in 
place a strategy to ensure that the action 
taken does not lead to a greater escalation of 
tensions between Iran and the United States 
or in the worst case, another war in the Middle 
East placing at risk the lives and safety of mil-
lions of persons. 
Madam Speaker, Major General Soleimani 
was the long-time chief of the Quds Force, the 
elite special forces battalion of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), assisted 
Syrian strongman Bashar al Assad slaughter 
hundreds of thousands of his own people in 
the Syrian civil war, helped incite the Houthis 
in Yemen’s civil war, and oversaw the brutal 
killing of hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently 
demonstrating against Iranian influence in their 
country. 
Iran’s Quds Force, under Soleimani’s lead-
ership, has long been suspected by the U.S. 
Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to 
assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the 
United States and bore responsibility for the 
deaths of more than 600 Americans killed by 
Iranian proxies since the 2003 inception of the 
war in Iraq. 
Over the past eight months, in response to 
rising tensions with Iran, the United States has 
introduced over 15,000 additional forces into 
the Middle East. 
But Major General Soleimani was more than 
a military leader, he was a high-ranking polit-
ical leader, second only in power and influ-
ence to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei. 
In fact, Soleimani was regarded by many as 
a future president of Iran. 
It was foreseeable therefore that the killing 
of Soleimani by American forces was likely to 
invite retaliation by Iran putting at risk Amer-
ican military and civilian personnel, as well as 
its allies in the region and across the globe. 
It must be remembered, Madam Speaker, 
the United States has national interests in pre-
serving its partnership with Iraq and other 
countries in the region, including by combating 
terrorists, including the Islamic State of Iraq 
and Syria (ISIS); preventing Iran from achiev-
ing a nuclear weapons capability; and sup-
porting the people of Iraq, Iran, and other 
countries throughout the Middle East who de-
mand an end to government corruption and 
violations of basic human rights. 
For these reasons it is essential that the Ad-
ministration have in place a sound, well-con-
sidered, and meticulously developed strategy 
for managing disputes with Iran. 
That does not appear to be the case. 
There is no evidence that the Administration 
consulted with Congress or the Gang of 8, no 
evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our 
allies in NATO or the region, no evidence that 
the Administration has a working and well- 
functioning national security council apparatus. 
This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in deal-
ing with the Middle East for as former Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell stated before the 
Iraq War, ‘‘If you break it, you bought it.’’ 
Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei 
has vowed that a ‘‘harsh retaliation is waiting’’ 
for the United States as a consequence of the 
action taken by the Administration. 
It is imperative that the Administration have 
in place a strategy to counter and deescalate 
any Iranian response and have in place meas-
ure to protect the safety of Americans residing 
or travelling abroad and to protect the security 
of the homeland. 
The deliberate and targeted killing of Major 
General Soleimani has the potential to be the 
most consequential assassination of a political 
leader since World War I was started by the 
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand 
Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, the heir 
presumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary 
in 1914. 
One of the enduring lessons of the Great 
War too often forgotten but so well docu-
mented in Barbara Tuchman’s prize-winning 
history, ‘‘The Guns of August,’’ is that mis-
conceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes re-
sult in the tragedy of horrific warfare; among 
them are overestimating the value of one’s 
economic power, harboring an ill-founded be-
lief in quick victory, and a failure to consider 
political backlash warfare. 
Madam Speaker, the decision to send 
American men and women into harm’s way is 
the most consequential decision the Constitu-
tion vests in the Congress and the President. 
Members of Congress must be apprised of 
all facts material to the decision and have ac-
cess to relevant documentation, classified and 
otherwise, and afforded the opportunity to 
meet in small groups and in secure locations 
with senior members of the Administration’s 
national security team who can answer de-
tailed and pointed questions and provide re-
quested information. 
The Constitution wisely divides the responsi-
bility of deciding when to use military force to 
protect the nation and its interests between 
the President and the Congress, the rep-
resentatives of the American people. 
The United States’ military involvement in 
Iraq begun in March 2003 and continuing to 
this day has taught this nation the importance 
of having accurate and reliable information 
when deciding whether to use military force 
and the painful costs in lives and treasure of 
acting precipitously or unwisely. 
We cannot and dare not repeat that mis-
take. 
That is why I am proud to support and co-
sponsor H. Con. Res. 83, the concurrent reso-
lution before us, which directs the President to 
terminate immediately the use of United 
States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in 
or against Iran or any part of its government 
or military, unless Congress has declared war 
or enacted specific statutory authorization for 
such use of the Armed Forces; or the use of 
the Armed Forces is necessary and appro-
priate to defend against an imminent armed 
attack upon the United States, its territories or 
possessions, or its Armed Forces, consistent 
with the requirements of the War Powers Res-
olution. 
Our constituents, all Americans across the 
country, and the people of the globe are look-
ing to us to ensure that tensions between the 
United States and Iran are deescalated, that 
smart power and diplomacy be employed, and 
every effort be made to ensure the peace and

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the question on agree-
ing to the Speaker’s approval of the 
Journal, which the Chair will put de 
novo. 
The question is on the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.

IRAN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 781, I call up 
the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 
83) directing the President pursuant to 
section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion to terminate the use of United 
States Armed Forces to engage in hos-
tilities in or against Iran, and ask for 
its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 781, the 
amendment printed in House Report 
116–371 is adopted, and the concurrent 
resolution, as amended, is considered 
read. 
The text of the concurrent resolu-
tion, as amended, is as follows: 
H. CON. RES. 83 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), 
SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES TO ENGAGE 
IN 
HOSTILITIES 
IN 
OR 
AGAINST 
IRAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Government of Iran is a leading 
state sponsor of terrorism and engages in a 
range of destabilizing activities across the 
Middle 
East. 
Iranian 
General 
Qassem 
Soleimani was the lead architect of much of 
Iran’s destabilizing activities throughout the 
world. 
(2) The United States has an inherent right 
to self-defense against imminent armed at-
tacks. The United States maintains the right 
to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel 
serving abroad. 
(3) In matters of imminent armed attacks, 
the executive branch should indicate to Con-
gress why military action was necessary 
within a certain window of opportunity, the 
possible harm that missing the window 
would cause, and why the action was likely 
to prevent future disastrous attacks against 
the United States. 
(4) The United States has national inter-
ests in preserving its partnership with Iraq 
and other countries in the region, including 
by— 
(A) combating terrorists, including the Is-
lamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); 
(B) preventing Iran from achieving a nu-
clear weapons capability; and 
(C) supporting the people of Iraq, Iran, and 
other countries throughout the Middle East 
who demand an end to government corrup-
tion and violations of basic human rights. 
(5) Over the past eight months, in response 
to rising tensions with Iran, the United 
States has introduced over 15,000 additional 
forces into the Middle East. 
(6) When the United States uses military 
force, the American people and members of 
the United States Armed Forces deserve a 
credible explanation regarding such use of 
military force. 
(7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
1541 et seq.) requires the President to consult 
with Congress ‘‘in every possible instance’’ 
before introducing United States Armed 
Forces into hostilities. 
(8) Congress has not authorized the Presi-
dent to use military force against Iran. 
(b) TERMINATION.—Pursuant to section 5(c) 
of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
1544(c)), Congress hereby directs the Presi-
dent to terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or 
against Iran or any part of its government or 
military, unless— 
(1) Congress has declared war or enacted 
specific statutory authorization for such use 
of the Armed Forces; or 
(2) such use of the Armed Forces is nec-
essary and appropriate to defend against an 
imminent armed attack upon the United 
States, its territories or possessions, or its 
Armed Forces, consistent with the require-
ments of the War Powers Resolution. 
(c) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section may be construed— 
(1) to prevent the President from using 
military force against al Qaeda or associated 
forces; 
(2) to limit the obligations of the executive 
branch set forth in the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.); 
(3) to affect the provisions of an Act or 
joint resolution of Congress specifically au-
thorizing the use of United States Armed 
Forces to engage in hostilities against Iran 
or any part of its government or military 
that is enacted after the date of the adoption 
of this concurrent resolution; 
(4) to prevent the use of necessary and ap-
propriate military force to defend United 
States allies and partners if authorized by 
Congress consistent with the requirements of 
the War Powers Resolution; or 
(5) to authorize the use of military force. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The con-
current resolution, as amended, shall 
be debatable for 2 hours, equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) and the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL) each will control 1 hour. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 83, currently under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We are here this afternoon so that 
this body can exercise one of its most

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H93 
January 9, 2020 
important constitutional responsibil-
ities, deciding on whether or not this 
country will wage war, whether or not 
we will check an executive that has 
brought our country to a dangerous 
brink. 
In recent months, tensions between 
the United States and Iran have ticked 
up, bit by bit, until this last week, 
when we found ourselves in a crisis like 
we haven’t seen in decades. 
Let’s be clear: The Iranians are re-
sponsible for their own harmful behav-
ior. We know this is a regime that un-
derwrites 
terrorism, 
that 
tries 
to 
strengthen its own position by foment-
ing instability and provocation. We 
know that about Iran. No one expects 
Iran to be the adult in the room when 
it comes to global affairs. 
What we do expect is that American 
leadership and American policy will be 
the moderating force. 
So the world was stunned last week 
when the Trump administration chose, 
instead, the path towards escalation 
with the killing of Qasem Soleimani. 
We 
need 
to 
be 
honest 
about 
Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He had 
masterminded attacks and campaigns 
that cost thousands of innocent lives. 
In the places where we have seen Iran’s 
most harmful activity, Soleimani’s fin-
gerprints were everywhere. He had 
American blood on his hands, and the 
world is better off without him. 
But are we really safer today, as the 
administration claims, with American 
citizens told to get out of Iraq as fast 
as they can; thousands of troops de-
ploying to the Middle East; an eviction 
notice from the Iraqi Government, 
whose partnership we depend on in the 
fight against ISIS; Iranian missiles en-
dangering American personnel? 
It certainly doesn’t feel like we are 
safer, and a poll out today shows that 
the American people agree. 
In foreign policy, you have to weigh 
decisions 
like 
this. 
As 
awful 
as 
Soleimani was, this action has endan-
gered American lives and American se-
curity. 
The President and his advisers say 
they had no choice; that there was im-
minent threat. Then they said, well, he 
had done bad things in the past and 
was going to do more bad things in the 
future. When they sent a report on the 
strike to Congress, the administration 
took 
the 
highly 
unusual 
step 
of 
classifying it. 
And then yesterday, in a classified 
briefing, when Members demanded to 
see the evidence that justified the 
strike, the message from the adminis-
tration essentially boiled down to this: 
Trust us. When we asked, What is the 
plan going forward? The administra-
tion essentially told Members: Trust 
us. 
Trust us is not good enough, Madam 
Speaker, not for me, and not for the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, if they are going to 
send our men and women in uniform 
into harm’s way, they shouldn’t hide 
the facts. 
First of all, this administration 
hasn’t given us any reason to believe 
that this is a fact. The foreign policy of 
this administration has undermined 
American leadership, cut our diplomats 
off at the knees, alienated our allies, 
and walked away from our obligations. 
We have lurched from crisis to crisis, 
each time hoping that the situation 
won’t spin out of control. 
I call it fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants 
foreign policy, and it is no way to ad-
vance American interests and values 
on the global stage. 
But beyond that, beyond the way this 
administration has acted, it is not the 
job of Congress to give any administra-
tion its blind trust. It is why we have 
separation of powers. It is why the 
Constitution entrusts war powers to 
Congress. 
Let me say that again. It is why the 
Constitution entrusts war powers to 
Congress. We haven’t had a declared 
war in this country since World War II. 
It is not the way it should happen. 
So it is a relief that both the admin-
istration and the Iranians have, for the 
moment, opted to de-escalate. But we 
would be foolish to think this crisis is 
over. It could flame up again in the 
blink of an eye, and I worry that an-
other misstep on either side could be 
what plunges our country into another 
ill-advised war in the Middle East. 
I will say it very plainly: The Amer-
ican people do not want war with Iran. 
With the measure before us today, we 
are denying the President the author-
ity to wage such a war. 
This would direct the President to 
terminate the use of armed force 
against Iran without congressional au-
thorization unless it is necessary to re-
spond to an imminent armed attack 
against the United States. 
The President always has the power 
to defend America. No one denies that. 
This resolution explicitly preserves 
this right, but that is a limited excep-
tion. The President shouldn’t abuse it. 
Now, we have heard the argument 
that the 2002 Authorization for the Use 
of Military Force, the Iraq war author-
ization, would justify military action 
against Iran. That is just wrong. It is 
not what Congress intended when it 
passed that resolution. I was here. I re-
member it. It should be repealed, not 
used to launch more military action. 
If the President wants to use mili-
tary force against Iran, he has to come 
to Congress. Any President has to 
come to Congress. We are not making 
rules only for this President. We are 
making rules for the President, any 
President, vis-a-vis, Congress’ constitu-
tional powers. 
The President has to make the case 
first, first, not after he launches an ill- 
advised attack, then after the fact, 
comes up with a reason why it was nec-
essary and why it was legal. That is 
not the way our system works. 
Today, I have heard the myth float-
ing around that this resolution is non-
binding; that it is just symbolic. So let 
me quote from the War Powers Act to 
prove that untrue. 
The War Powers law says: ‘‘At any 
time that United States Armed Forces 
are engaged in hostilities outside the 
territory of the United States, its pos-
sessions and territories without a dec-
laration of war or specific statutory 
authorization, such forces shall be re-
moved by the President if the Congress 
so directs by concurrent resolution.’’ 
Again, by concurrent resolution. That 
is what the War Powers Act states that 
we need do. That is what we are doing 
today. 
This is the House of Representatives 
exercising its Article I authority. We 
don’t get authority over war powers 
just because—if the President says so. 
We get authority over war powers, pe-
riod. That is our authority. So let’s put 
that fiction to rest. 
And one final point, Madam Speaker, 
about the tone of this debate. Yester-
day, a Member of this body went on 
television and said that Democrats 
‘‘are in love with terrorists. They 
mourn 
Soleimani 
more 
than 
they 
mourn our Gold Star families.’’ 
Another Member labeled a group of 
colleagues ‘‘Ayatollah sympathizers.’’ 
At a time when we are talking about 
policy that will have direct bearing on 
American men and women, service-
members and diplomats in harm’s way, 
comments like that reflect very poorly 
on this body. And I remind the House 
that all Members, in both parties, re-
gardless of party, love this country. 
These words have no place in this de-
bate. 
On the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
we take pride in debating issues, even 
the toughest issues, on the merits and 
on the facts. I salute my friend, the 
ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, for 
working so closely with me to make 
sure we do so. That is one of the keys 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
I strongly encourage all Members on 
both sides to bear that in mind during 
this debate. We all take the same oath. 
We can argue about this resolution 
without questioning one another’s mo-
tives or one another’s patriotism. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 83. 
When President Obama took down 
Osama Bin Laden, the Republican 
Members joined with Democrats, as 
Americans, to praise the President. Un-
fortunately, today, Democrats are in-
capable of giving this President credit 
where 
credit 
is 
due, 
which 
only 
emboldens Iran. 
I am surprised to be faced with this 
partisan resolution today. We should 
be standing together, as the chairman 
mentioned, as a Nation. Instead, this 
resolution plays politics with national 
security. 
Yesterday, the President laid out a 
measured response to Iran’s ballistic 
missile attacks. Let me be clear. The 
President is not seeking war with Iran. 
The President has shown, if anything,

great restraint regarding Iran, includ-
ing after Iran’s downing of a U.S. 
drone, a U.S. military asset. 
But in their blind contempt for the 
President, my colleagues are ignoring 
the assessments of career intelligence 
and military professionals. 
b 1445 
Our colleagues on the other side are 
downplaying the murderous evil of 
Soleimani, the mastermind of terror in 
the Middle East for over two decades. 
Soleimani was designated as a ter-
rorist by the Obama administration. 
He was responsible for the deaths of 
more than 600 Americans and wounded 
thousands more. 
Soleimani was involved in the Ira-
nian plot to assassinate the Saudi Am-
bassador to the United States on Amer-
ican soil in Georgetown, right in this 
city. Soleimani oversaw Iran’s support 
for Assad in Syria, including con-
vincing Russia to fight for Assad, kill-
ing hundreds of thousands. This year, 
Soleimani played a key role in the 
crackdown on protestors in Iraq that 
killed hundreds of Iraqis. 
It should be clear to any reasonable 
person that Soleimani posed a long- 
term threat to the United States and 
to innocent civilians in the Middle 
East and across the globe. We don’t 
need to get into classified details to see 
Soleimani’s clear threat. 
According to the Department of De-
fense, in the last 2 months, Soleimani 
and his proxies launched 12 attacks 
against U.S. forces and facilities in 
Iraq. On December 27, Soleimani’s Ira-
nian proxies killed an American and in-
jured four U.S. servicemembers near 
Kirkuk. On December 31, Soleimani’s 
Iranian proxies launched an assault on 
the United States Embassy in Baghdad. 
But Soleimani was not done. Sec-
retary Pompeo said that Soleimani was 
‘‘actively plotting’’ to take ‘‘big ac-
tion’’ that would ‘‘put dozens if not 
hundreds of American lives at risk,’’ 
which DOD said targeted American dip-
lomats and servicemembers in Iraq and 
throughout the region. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, 
General Milley, said that the adminis-
tration would have been ‘‘culpably neg-
ligent,’’ given the evidence and intel-
ligence they had, had they not acted. 
The President possessed the legal au-
thority for this strike and complied 
with his obligation to report it to Con-
gress within 48 hours under the War 
Powers Resolution. The President has 
inherent Article II authority as Com-
mander in Chief to defend United 
States personnel from attacks that 
Soleimani was carrying out and plot-
ting against Americans. It is an act of 
self-defense. 
This is not just a partisan analysis. 
Jeh Johnson, President Obama’s gen-
eral counsel at the Department of De-
fense and former Secretary of Home-
land Security, approved the airstrikes 
during the Obama administration. He 
stated that Soleimani ‘‘was a lawful 
military objective, and the President, 
under his constitutional authority as 
Commander in Chief, had ample domes-
tic legal authority to take him out 
without an additional congressional 
authorization.’’ That was President 
Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
As a second authority, the National 
Security Adviser cited the 2002 AUMF 
that authorized the use of force ‘‘to de-
fend the national security of the 
United States against the continuing 
threat posed by Iraq.’’ That authoriza-
tion has been used previously to ad-
dress terrorist threats to U.S. per-
sonnel inside Iraq, including by Presi-
dent Obama to go after ISIS terrorist 
forces in Iraq. 
The dangerously partisan reactions 
to last week’s strike in defense of 
Americans are even more apparent 
when compared to Democratic reac-
tions to Obama’s thousands of unau-
thorized airstrikes in defense of Liby-
ans inside Libya in 2011. 
Back 
in 
June 
2011, 
then-Leader 
PELOSI was asked about the Obama ad-
ministration’s months of airstrikes in-
side Libya, dropping hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in U.S. munitions with-
out congressional authorization. Lead-
er PELOSI was asked: ‘‘Madam Leader, 
you are saying that the President did 
not need authorization initially and 
still does not need any authorization 
from Congress on Libya?’’ Her answer 
was, ‘‘Yes.’’ 
She said: ‘‘I believe the limited na-
ture of this engagement allows the 
President to go forward. . . . I am sat-
isfied that the President has the au-
thority he needs to go ahead.’’ 
That logic should apply far more in 
the strike against Soleimani to protect 
Americans. 
I am pleased the administration did 
not hesitate to take bold action, given 
the 
high 
threat 
level. 
Soleimani 
showed us through the embassy attack 
and the attacks on U.S. forces that he 
was serious about hurting Americans. 
Our intelligence community saw his 
next plan coming together, and our 
military, under direction from our 
Commander in Chief, acted. They saw 
the storm coming, and they stopped it. 
I thank the President and the men 
and women of our intelligence commu-
nity and the military for upholding 
their responsibility to protect Amer-
ican lives. Instead of supporting the 
President, unfortunately, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are dividing Ameri-
cans at a critical time, weakening our 
leverage overseas and emboldening our 
enemy, the largest state sponsor of ter-
ror in the world. 
I ask my colleagues to oppose this 
resolution, which seeks to tie the 
President’s hands as he continues to 
defend Americans in the Middle East. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN), the author of 
this important resolution. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, a War Pow-
ers Resolution that states that the 
President of the United States must 
consult Congress before going to war 
with Iran. This is simply what our Con-
stitution requires. 
For me, this is not a theoretical exer-
cise. My husband spent 30 years in the 
Army and retired as a colonel. We ac-
tually met on my third tour in Iraq, 
when I was a CIA officer. My step-
daughter is a brand-new Army officer. 
My son-in-law’s unit is stationed at Al 
Asad Air Base, which was just targeted 
by ballistic missiles this week. 
If our loved ones are going to be sent 
to fight in any protracted war, the 
President owes the American public a 
conversation. The resolution we will be 
voting on today allows us to start that 
debate, as our Founders intended. 
Let me be clear: The Government of 
Iran is a leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism and engages in a range of desta-
bilizing activities across the Middle 
East. I have experienced these person-
ally as a former CIA analyst. I served 
multiple tours in Iraq, three tours. My 
specialty is Iranian-backed Shia mili-
tias. 
I have followed Iran’s destabilizing 
activity in Iraq up close for my entire 
professional career. I have watched 
friends and colleagues hurt or killed by 
Iranian rockets, mortars, and explosive 
devices. 
Iranian 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani was the lead architect of 
much of Iran’s destabilizing activities 
in the Middle East and throughout the 
world. 
To that end, with Iran or with any 
other adversary, the United States al-
ways has the inherent right and obliga-
tion to self-defense against imminent 
armed attacks—always. The United 
States always maintains the right and 
the responsibility to ensure the safety 
of our diplomatic personnel and our 
Armed Forces serving abroad. 
When it comes to the matter of 
longer term war either as something 
that we choose as a Nation or as some-
thing that we find ourselves in, as 
Members of this body, we have a con-
stitutional responsibility to authorize 
the use of military force. 
The Framers of our Constitution 
rightly believed that the power to de-
clare war belongs in the Congress be-
cause this would ensure that the Amer-
ican people, through the legislators 
they elected, weigh the most signifi-
cant decision a government can make. 
To this end, the resolution does a few 
simple things. 
First, it states that the President 
does not currently have authorization 
for war against Iran, which his own 
Secretary of Defense acknowledged in 
a congressional hearing last month. 
Second, it requires the President to 
get congressional authorization if he 
wants to conduct a protracted war with 
Iran. 
Third, it makes clear that the Presi-
dent maintains the authority to use 
force to prevent imminent attacks 
against the United States or our forces. 
As someone who has spent her career

January 9, 2020 
in national security, it is extremely 
important to me that this resolution in 
no way ties the President’s hands or 
takes away any capabilities from our 
military commanders to respond in 
self-defense for ourselves and our al-
lies. 
We have been at war for nearly two 
decades, which has spanned both Re-
publican and Democratic administra-
tions, as my colleague pointed out. In 
that time, Congress has voted only 
twice to authorize the use of military 
force, in 2001 and 2002. 
Congress has long abdicated its re-
sponsibility as laid out in the Constitu-
tion to make the hard decisions we owe 
our troops when it comes to author-
izing war. We owe it to our military 
and to ourselves as a Nation to open 
this conversation on the authorization 
of military force, to provide our troops 
that clarity, and to abide by the Con-
stitution that we have all sworn to pro-
tect. 
I urge my colleagues, Republicans 
and Democrats, to support this resolu-
tion. I know it is a political time, but 
my attempt was to hew exactly to 
what our Founders intended. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The United States and our allies are 
safer with Qasem Soleimani gone. 
President Trump’s decisive leadership 
was justified, and it was right. 
Soleimani had the blood of over 600 
American 
servicemembers 
on 
his 
hands. For more than 20 years, he at-
tacked our troops, established a brutal 
reign of terror across the Middle East, 
and was directly responsible for the 
death of thousands of innocent civil-
ians, including in his own country. And 
he had more terror planned. 
As President Trump said, this strike 
was done to prevent a war, not start 
one. In yesterday’s address, he was true 
to his word. He was confident and re-
strained. Even as he underscored our 
strength and resolve, he extended the 
people of Iran our hand in peace and 
friendship. President Trump’s decision 
to embrace the Reagan doctrine of 
peace through strength in dealing with 
Iran has worked. 
Those who criticize President Trump 
for Iran’s dangerous foreign policy 
should actually spend a few moments 
to review their history. It is Iran that 
is responsible for escalating tensions 
by creating chaos to spread fear and 
accumulate power. 
In the decades since 1979’s revolution, 
Iran has become the number one state 
sponsor of terrorism in the world. More 
recently, it shot down an American 
military drone and seized a British oil 
tanker. 
On December 27, Iranian proxies 
crossed the line by killing an Amer-
ican. For the first time since 1988, we 
have an administration willing to 
strike back. From most of the media 
reports, many may know him only as 
an unnamed U.S. contractor killed in 
Iraq, but he was more than that. His 
name was Nawres Hamid. He was a hus-
band. He was the father of two young 
sons. He was a resident of California. 
Before Nawres became a citizen, he 
was valiantly serving alongside our 
troops as a linguist. All of our hearts 
break for his wife and children, who are 
left mourning his death. 
There are some in this Chamber who 
seem to be downplaying his death, but 
his death matters. It matters to his 
family. It matters to his countrymen. 
It matters to the President. It matters 
to me. His death was unnecessary, 
unprovoked, and it deserved justice. 
That is why my next statement car-
ries even more meaning. Red lines 
should mean something. In this admin-
istration, they do. Killing Nawres was 
a red line. Planning to kill Americans 
is a red line. 
I am confident that the right deci-
sion was to take out the man respon-
sible for Nawres’ death and the death 
of hundreds of other Americans. 
Iran responded earlier this week by 
sending missiles to U.S. bases in Iraq. I 
believe we are all relieved and grateful 
that there were no American casual-
ties. Iran appears to be pulling back 
from its strategy of provocation in the 
face of firm American determination. 
Iran seems to understand that deesca-
lation is right for them and the world. 
Now is the time for our country to 
come together and speak with one 
voice, not as Republicans, not as 
Democrats, but as Americans. 
b 1500 
Instead of working with this adminis-
tration to continue to work toward 
shared goals, Democrats are using this 
moment to continue their hatred to-
ward the President. 
As my colleague and former CIA offi-
cer WILL HURD said, he never thought 
he would see the day that the Iranian 
Government would be able to manipu-
late Members of Congress, Democratic 
Presidential candidates, and the West-
ern media, yet here we are on this floor 
today. 
If President Trump’s instinct is to 
put America first, his critics’ instinct 
is to blame America first. 
The words of my Democratic col-
leagues, including the Speaker of the 
House, blame the United States for at-
tacks Iran has been initiating for the 
past four decades. Now, they want to 
limit the President’s ability to defend 
America. That is just dangerous. 
I want to clear up some news, Madam 
Speaker, that I actually even recently 
heard on this floor. I would probably 
consider it fake news that Democrats 
have told the American people. 
Contrary to their claim, the resolu-
tion before the House today is non-
binding. It is called a concurrent reso-
lution. This resolution, if passed, won’t 
go to the President’s desk for signa-
ture. It won’t have the power of law. 
Madam Speaker, I heard the chair-
man try to claim that this had power. 
I know we have three coequal branches 
of government. 
Madam Speaker, I think the chair-
man should actually look at what the 
Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha 
case, that concurrent resolutions are 
unconstitutional as a means to limit 
the executive branch. I think I may 
need to read it twice, so let’s do that. 
In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in 
the Chadha case that concurrent reso-
lutions 
are 
unconstitutional 
as 
a 
means to limit the executive branch. 
The purpose of a concurrent resolution 
is to deal with mundane housekeeping 
matters in Congress. 
Now, I want everybody to know and 
understand what we have used concur-
rent resolutions for—it is very impor-
tant: to authorize the use of the Cap-
itol Grounds for the Soap Box Derby, 
to use the rotunda to present a con-
gressional medal to Jack Nicklaus, and 
to host a birthday party in the Capitol 
Visitor Center. But the new majority 
decided to use it for something dif-
ferent. 
For a party that wants to claim they 
care about the Constitution, Madam 
Speaker, Democrats may want to brush 
up on their facts. If they did, they 
would realize their actions today are 
shameful and embarrassing, even by 
the low standards they set in their im-
peachment inquiry. 
They seem to have forgotten that we 
are not the House of Resolutions. We 
are, actually, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Our job isn’t to debate 
feelings. Our job isn’t to make rec-
ommendations. We are, actually, elect-
ed to make law. 
But that is not how we are spending 
our time today. This resolution has as 
much force of law as a new year’s reso-
lution. It is nothing more than a press 
release to appease their socialist base. 
What message is it sending to Iran? 
That we are strong, determined, and 
united as a country, or that we are di-
vided, shortsighted, and weak? 
Madam Speaker, ‘‘In war, resolu-
tion,’’ and, ‘‘in peace, goodwill.’’ Win-
ston Churchill wrote those words after 
he led Britain to victory in the Second 
World War. They describe what he be-
lieved were the right actions for great 
leaders to take at history’s defining 
moment. 
We should keep Churchill’s words in 
mind today. President Trump clearly 
has. Because of President Trump’s 
leadership, the United States and our 
allies are safer today than we were ex-
actly 1 week ago. 
Petty politics are wrong for the 
country, especially now. Not liking 
President Trump is not an excuse for 
failing to see that the President and 
his administration have a sensible and 
deeply American strategy for dealing 
with Iran. 
Madam Speaker, I imagine we will 
continue to hear from other Democrats 
defending Iran for their escalation and 
the death of an American. Madam 
Speaker, I imagine that the Democrats 
will try to claim a concurrent resolu-
tion is more than a Soap Box Derby, 
but the Supreme Court says otherwise.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H96 
January 9, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I imagine I will 
hear a lot from the Democrats today. I 
would like to hear a Democrat speak to 
the 600 Gold Star families whose loved 
ones were killed by Soleimani. I would 
like to hear them defend that. 
I would like to hear them defend Iran 
and their actions of burning an em-
bassy, of killing an American, of kill-
ing thousands of civilians even in their 
own country. But they are going to 
take our time today with something 
that means nothing. 
Yes, they will run to the mikes. They 
will get on TV. They will tell a little 
more fake news, that it meant some-
thing today. 
The only thing that will happen 
today is it will make Iran believe they 
are stronger. It will make Iran believe 
they have allies in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Today is a day that we will not be 
proud of. 
Madam Speaker, in light of the infor-
mation that we have coming out of 
Iran, if it is true, of why an airliner 
was shot down, if that was the case, I 
would like to see a Democrat move to 
the floor and pull this concurrent reso-
lution. If it means nothing else, I think 
we should have all the facts. 
I look forward to listening, Madam 
Speaker, to any Democrat who wants 
to speak to the Gold Star families 
about why they want to have a debate 
today and tell them that ‘‘Soleimani is 
bad, but.’’ It is not ‘‘but’’; it is ‘‘be-
cause,’’ because he killed Americans, 
because he killed thousands of civil-
ians. That is why he was taken out, 
and the world is safer because of it. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
hearing the defense from the other 
side. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I am 
sorry that the Republican leader is 
casting aspersions. I think everyone on 
both sides of the aisle takes this seri-
ously and has reasons for what we are 
voting on. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
KHANNA), a gentleman who has been 
very involved in these issues for a long, 
long time and has been a real leader in 
these issues. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman ENGEL
for yielding 
and for his leadership. 
I rise today not as a partisan but as 
someone concerned about America’s fu-
ture. 
We have worked across the aisle with 
people like Representative MEADOWS 
and others to stop our country from 
getting into endless wars. There is not 
one party that wants to stop these 
wars; this is in our national interest. 
Now, let’s be very clear. Soleimani 
had blood on his hands. Soleimani was 
a bad actor. Soleimani killed Ameri-
cans. That is not the debate. 
The 
debate 
is 
whether 
America 
should get into another war in the Mid-
dle East or whether we should be fo-
cused on our real competition, which is 
China. 
We are 21 percent of the world’s GDP. 
China, our competition for the 21st 
century, is 15 percent. Iran is 0.44 per-
cent of GDP. 
China hasn’t been in a war since 1979. 
We are in 40 conflicts. 
Future historians will ask why we 
were so obsessed with a region, the 
Middle East, with 3.5 percent of GDP, 
when we should have been focused on 
investing in our country to build the 
future, to win the 21st century. 
I don’t think staying out of bad wars 
that cost this country trillions of dol-
lars is a Democratic issue or a Repub-
lican issue. Frankly, the President ran 
on this. 
I know Leader MCCARTHY says this is 
a formality. Under the War Powers 
Act, you are supposed to have a con-
current resolution. 
My hope is the President will agree 
with this and not get us into a war 
with Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman yielding. 
I will make my final point. This 
shouldn’t be partisan. 
Here is what I would love to see, that 
the President says, in the future ac-
tion, he is not going to get into a war 
and that he agrees with the concurrent 
resolution that this body passes. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this resolution, 
which curtails the President’s author-
ity to protect American interests in 
the Middle East. 
Two 
weeks 
ago, 
Iranian 
proxies 
launched a missile attack on American 
forces in Iraq. This was the 11th such 
rocket attack by the Iranians in recent 
months. This time, as our leader said, 
it killed Nawres Hamid, who was a hus-
band, a father, a contractor, and an 
American citizen. 
The man behind this attack and addi-
tional attacks that were being planned 
and that were imminent was the ter-
rorist mastermind Qasem Soleimani, 
who was responsible for the deaths, as 
we have heard, of at least 600, probably 
many more, Americans and for thou-
sands of others in that part of the 
world, and for causing destabilization 
throughout the entire region. 
For years now, Soleimani had been 
leading Iran’s shadow war against us 
and against our allies. In targeting 
Soleimani, President Trump took bold, 
long-overdue action, and he ought to be 
supported for this decision, not criti-
cized. 
This resolution, by condemning even 
limited military force and limited ac-
tion, would essentially tie the Presi-
dent’s hands behind his back as he tries 
to counter Iran’s shadow campaign 
against us. 
Madam Speaker, it makes no sense, 
this resolution, and I strongly urge my 
colleagues 
to 
oppose 
it 
and 
vote 
against it. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
America is not safe or safer because of 
the acts that occurred local time on 
January 3, 2020. 
America is in more jeopardy, as are 
our brave men and women in the 
United States military, whom we hold 
in the highest esteem and say to their 
families: We are obligated and com-
mitted to honoring and thanking you, 
but to also recognizing, when we send 
you into battle, there would and should 
be the consultation, the engagement, 
the understanding of the intelligence 
and the work between Article I, the 
United States Congress, and Article II, 
the President of the United States. 
I will not allow any Member of Con-
gress to malign my Gold Star families 
or to suggest that any Member here 
does not respect the ultimate sacrifice 
that their family members took. Fam-
ily members who are Gold Star should 
not be used in a political debate. They 
should only be honored. 
And I will not accept anyone describ-
ing Democrats as mourning terrorists. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
what I will say is that nothing in this 
resolution speaks to any named person. 
It says that this body, this Congress, 
must adhere to its duty to be able to 
ensure that the President of the United 
States does not unilaterally take us 
into war with Iran. We will not stand 
for it. 
It does, as well, say that my resolu-
tion in 2002 indicated that we should 
not have gone to war in Iraq. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House Committees on the Judiciary and on 
Homeland Security, as a member serving in 
this body on September 11, 2001 and 
throughout the fateful and tragic war in Iraq, 
and as an original cosponsor, I rise in strong 
support of H. Con. Res. 83, a concurrent reso-
lution directing the President to terminate the 
engagement of United States Armed Forces in 
hostilities in or against Iran. 
l thank the gentlelady from Michigan, Con-
gresswoman ELISSA SLOTKIN, for introducing 
this resolution and Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chair ELIOT ENGEL for his work on this impor-
tant resolution. 
I also thank Speaker PELOSI for taking swift 
action to afford the House the opportunity to 
honor its constitutional duty to keep the Amer-
ican people safe by limiting the President from 
taking further precipitous military actions re-
garding Iran. 
We know from bitter and heart-breaking ex-
perience the truth that while dangerous and 
bloody battles are fought by the military, it is 
the nation that goes to war. 
And that is why the Framers lodged the 
awesome power to declare and take the na-
tion to war not in the hands of a single indi-
vidual, but through Article I, Section, clause 11

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 9, 2020 
in the collective judgment of Congress, the 
representatives of the American people. 
It is true of course that the United States 
has an inherent right to self-defense against 
imminent armed attacks and that it maintains 
the right to ensure the safety of diplomatic 
personnel serving abroad. 
But in matters of imminent armed attacks, 
the executive branch must inform Congress as 
to why military action was necessary within a 
certain window of opportunity, the possible 
harm that missing the window would cause, 
and why the action was likely to prevent future 
disastrous attacks against the United States. 
Only after being fully briefed and informed is 
the Congress in a position to validate and rat-
ify or disapprove and terminate the action. 
Madam Speaker, Section 5(c) of the 1973 
War Power Resolution, Pub. L. 93–148, pro-
vides that whenever ‘‘United States Armed 
Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the 
territory of the United States, its possessions 
and territories without a declaration of war or 
specific statutory authorization, such forces 
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs by concurrent resolution.’’ 
The military action ordered on Friday, Janu-
ary 3, 2020, local time by the President to kill 
Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of 
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, may 
have rid the world of a major architect of terror 
but leaves unanswered the critically important 
question of why the action was taken at that 
time. 
Even at this late hour, members of Con-
gress have not been briefed or been shown 
compelling evidence by the Administration that 
the action was necessary to repel a credible, 
certain, and imminent attack on the United 
States, its allies, or American civilians or mili-
tary personnel. 
The Administration has yet to provide proof 
or assuage the concerns of most member of 
Congress, and of the American people, that 
the killing of Major General Soleimani was a 
necessary action that was the product of a 
carefully crafted geopolitical strategy devel-
oped after extensive discussion within the na-
tional security apparatus regarding the short 
and long-term consequences for the security 
of the region and our nation and its people. 
Similarly, we do not know whether the deci-
sion to engage in the hostile action against 
Iran was made by the President in consulta-
tion and agreement with our regional and 
international allies and whether there is now in 
place a strategy to ensure that the action 
taken does not lead to a greater escalation of 
tensions between Iran and the United States 
or in the worst case, another war in the Middle 
East placing at risk the lives and safety of mil-
lions of persons. 
Madam Speaker, Major General Soleimani 
was the long-time chief of the Quds Force, the 
elite special forces battalion of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), assisted 
Syrian strongman Bashar al Assad slaughter 
hundreds of thousands of his own people in 
the Syrian civil war, helped incite the Houthis 
in Yemen’s civil war, and oversaw the brutal 
killing of hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently 
demonstrating against Iranian influence in their 
country. 
Iran’s Quds Force, under Soleimani’s lead-
ership, has long been suspected by the U.S. 
Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to 
assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the 
United States and bore responsibility for the 
deaths of more than 600 Americans killed by 
Iranian proxies since the 2003 inception of the 
war in Iraq. 
Over the past eight months, in response to 
rising tensions with Iran, the United States has 
introduced over 15,000 additional forces into 
the Middle East. 
But Major General Soleimani was more than 
a military leader, he was a high-ranking polit-
ical leader, second only in power and influ-
ence to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei. 
In fact, Soleimani was regarded by many as 
a future president of Iran. 
It was foreseeable therefore that the killing 
of Soleimani by American forces was likely to 
invite retaliation by Iran putting at risk Amer-
ican military and civilian personnel, as well as 
its allies in the region and across the globe. 
It must be remembered that the United 
States has national interests in preserving its 
partnership with Iraq and other countries in the 
region, including by combating terrorists, in-
cluding the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
(ISIS); preventing Iran from achieving a nu-
clear weapons capability; and supporting the 
people of Iraq, Iran, and other countries 
throughout the Middle East who demand an 
end to government corruption and violations of 
basic human rights. 
For these reasons it is essential that the Ad-
ministration have in place a sound, well-con-
sidered, and meticulously developed strategy 
for managing disputes with Iran. 
That does not appear to be the case. 
There is no evidence that the Administration 
consulted with Congress or the Gang of 8, no 
evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our 
allies in NATO or the region, no evidence that 
the Administration has a working and well- 
functioning national security council apparatus. 
This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in deal-
ing with the Middle East for as former Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell stated before the 
Iraq War, ‘‘If you break it, you bought it.’’ 
Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei 
has vowed that a ‘‘harsh retaliation is waiting’’ 
for the United States as a consequence of the 
action taken by the Administration. 
It is imperative that the Administration have 
in place a strategy to counter and deescalate 
any Iranian response and have in place meas-
ure to protect the safety of Americans residing 
or travelling abroad and to protect the security 
of the homeland. 
The deliberate and targeted killing of Major 
General Soleimani has the potential to be the 
most consequential assassination of a political 
leader since World War I was started by the 
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand 
Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, the heir 
presumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary 
in 1914. 
One of the enduring lessons of the Great 
War too often forgotten but so well docu-
mented in Barbara Tuchman’s prize-winning 
history, ‘‘The Guns of August,’’ is that mis-
conceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes re-
sult in the tragedy of horrific warfare; among 
them are overestimating the value of one’s 
economic power, harboring an ill-founded be-
lief in quick victory, and a failure to consider 
political backlash warfare. 
Madam Speaker, the decision to send 
American men and women into harm’s way is 
the most consequential decision the Constitu-
tion vests in the Congress and the President. 
Members of Congress must be apprised of 
all facts material to the decision and have ac-
cess to relevant documentation, classified and 
otherwise, and afforded the opportunity to 
meet in small groups and in secure locations 
with senior members of the Administration’s 
national security team who can answer de-
tailed and pointed questions and provide re-
quested information. 
The Constitution wisely divides the responsi-
bility of deciding when to use military force to 
protect the Nation and its interests between 
the President and the Congress, the rep-
resentatives of the American people. 
The United States’ military involvement in 
Iraq begun in March 2003 and continuing to 
this day has taught this Nation the importance 
of having accurate and reliable information 
when deciding whether to use military force 
and the painful costs in lives and treasure of 
acting precipitously or unwisely. 
We cannot and dare not repeat that mis-
take. 
That is why I am proud to support and co-
sponsor H. Con. Res. 83, the concurrent reso-
lution before us, which directs the President to 
terminate immediately the use of United 
States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in 
or against Iran or any part of its government 
or military, unless Congress has declared war 
or enacted specific statutory authorization for 
such use of the Armed Forces; or the use of 
the Armed Forces is necessary and appro-
priate to defend against an imminent armed 
attack upon the United States, its territories or 
possessions, or its Armed Forces, consistent 
with the requirements of the War Powers Res-
olution. 
Our constituents, all Americans across the 
country, and the people of the globe are look-
ing to us to ensure that tensions between the 
United States and Iran are deescalated, that 
smart power and diplomacy be employed, and 
every effort be made to ensure the peace and 
safety in America and the region, and the lives 
of the innocent not be placed at risk. 
Madam Speaker, today our Nation is debat-
ing the very profound question of war and 
peace and the structure and nature of inter-
national relations in the 21st century. Before 
us today is the serious and fundamental ques-
tion of life and death: whether or not this Con-
gress will give the President authority to com-
mit this Nation to war. 
Always a question of the greatest impor-
tance, our decision today is further weighted 
by the fact that we are being asked to sanc-
tion a new foreign policy doctrine that gives 
the President the power to launch a unilateral 
and preemptive first strike against Iraq before 
we have utilized our diplomatic options. 
My amendment provides an option and the 
time to pursue it. Its goal is to give the United 
Nations inspections process a chance to work. 
It provides an option short of war with the ob-
jective of protecting the American people and 
the world from any threat posed by Iraqi 
weapons of mass destruction. 
The amendment urges the United States to 
reengage the diplomatic process, and it 
stresses our government’s commitment to 
eliminating any Iraqi weapons of mass de-
struction through United Nations inspections 
and enhanced containment. 
It emphasizes the potentially dangerous and 
disastrous long-term consequences for the 
United States of codifying the President’s an-
nounced doctrine of preemption. 
The administration’s resolution forecloses al-
ternatives to war before we have even tried to 
pursue them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H98 
January 9, 2020 
We do not need to rush to war, and we 
should not rush to war. If what we are worried 
about is the defense of the United States and 
its people, we do not need this resolution. 
If the United States truly faced an imminent 
attack from anywhere, the President has all of 
the authority in the world to ensure our de-
fense based on the Constitution, the War 
Powers Act and the United Nations Charter. 
Our own intelligence agencies report that 
there is currently little chance of chemical and 
biological attack from Saddam Hussein on 
U.S. forces or territories. But they emphasize 
that an attack could become much more likely 
if Iraq believes that it is about to be attacked. 
This is a frightening and dangerous potential 
consequence that requires sober thought and 
careful reflection. 
President Bush’s doctrine of preemption vio-
lates international law, the United Nations 
Charter and our own long-term security inter-
ests. It will set a precedent that could come 
back to haunt us. 
Do we want to see our claim to preemption 
echoed by other countries maintaining that 
they perceive similar threats? India or Paki-
stan? China or Taiwan? Russia or Georgia? 
I would submit that we would have little 
moral authority to urge other countries to re-
sist launching preemptive strikes themselves. 
This approach threatens to destabilize the 
Middle East, unleash new forces of terrorism 
and instability and completely derail any pros-
pects for peace in the region. 
Unilateralism is not the answer. Iraqi weap-
ons of mass destruction are a problem to the 
world community, and we must confront it and 
we should do so through the United Nations. 
Multilateralism and steadfast commitment to 
international law should be the guiding prin-
ciple as we move into the 21st century. 
As I said, the purpose of my amendment is 
to let the United Nations do its work. Let us 
give inspections and other containment mech-
anisms a chance to succeed once again. In-
spections did make real progress in elimi-
nating weapons of mass destruction in the 
1990s despite Saddam Hussein’s best effort at 
obstruction and deceit. U.N. inspectors de-
stroyed large stockpiles of chemical weapons, 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction. 
We can and should renew and expand this 
process. In addition to inspections, we should 
improve border monitoring through an en-
hanced containment system to prevent ship-
ments of nuclear materials or other weapons 
to Iraq. And we should install surveillance 
technology on the border to detect such mate-
rials. 
As part of enhanced containment, we 
should work with the countries bordering Iraq 
and with regional seaports to ensure that 
United Nations Security Council resolutions 
are enforced, and we should plug holes in the 
current arms embargo blanket. We should 
also work on nonproliferation efforts globally to 
secure weapons materials. 
All of these are diplomatic options that we 
can and should undertake and which can lead 
to success. 
What we are doing today is building the 
framework for 21st century international rela-
tions. It will either be a framework of 
unilateralism and insecurity or multilateral co-
operation and security. It is our choice. 
During the Cold War, the words ‘‘first strike’’ 
filled us with fear. They still should. 
I am really appalled that a democracy, our 
democracy, is contemplating taking such a 
fearsome step and really setting such a ter-
rible international precedent that could be dev-
astating for global stability and for our own 
moral authority. 
We are contemplating sending our young 
men and women to war where they will be 
doing the killing and the dying. And we, as 
representatives of the American people, have 
no idea where this action will take us, where 
it will end and what price we will pay in terms 
of lives and resources. This too should cause 
us to pause. We have choices, however, and 
we have an obligation to pursue them, to give 
U.N. inspections and enhanced containment a 
chance to work. What this resolution does 
state very clearly and firmly is that the United 
States will work to disarm Iraq through United 
Nations inspections and other diplomatic tools. 
It states that we reject the doctrine of preemp-
tion, and it reaffirms our commitment to our 
own security and national interests through 
multilateral diplomacy, not unilateral attack. 
I urge you to protect our national interests 
by giving the United Nations a chance by sup-
porting this amendment. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, this week, universally 
respected Senator Joe Lieberman, a 
Democrat, provided an extraordinary 
op-ed in The Wall Street Journal: 
‘‘President Trump’s order to take out 
Qasem Soleimani was morally, con-
stitutionally, and strategically correct. 
. . . No American can dispute that 
Soleimani created, supported, and di-
rected a network of terrorist organiza-
tions that spread havoc in the Middle 
East.’’ In Syria, ‘‘more than 500,000 
Syrians have died.’’ 
‘‘During the Iraq war, Soleimani 
oversaw three camps in Iran.’’ These 
trained fighters have killed more than 
600 American soldiers. 
The claim that President Trump 
‘‘had no authority to order this attack 
without congressional approval is con-
stitutionally untenable and practically 
senseless. . . . Democrats should leave 
partisan politics at ‘the water’s edge’ 
and . . . stand together against Iran 
and dangerous leaders like Qasem 
Soleimani.’’ 
Senator Joe Lieberman tells the 
truth. We must resist: ‘‘Death to Amer-
ica,’’ ‘‘Death to Israel.’’ 
I extend our sympathies to the fam-
ily of Nawres Hamid, an Iraqi Amer-
ican Muslim from California, who was 
murdered by Soleimani-financed ter-
rorists 13 days ago. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), a valuable mem-
ber of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
b 1515 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H. Con. Res. 83, di-
recting the President to cease military 
hostilities against Iran. 
Last week, President Trump ordered 
a 
provocative 
and 
disproportionate 
drone strike, killing Quds Force com-
mander 
Major 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani. 
Soleimani was a malign actor who 
masterminded the killings of many 
U.S. soldiers, but assassinating him 
has unleashed the dogs of war. Iran 
launched a dozen ballistic missiles 
against two U.S. military bases in Iraq, 
and we must be prepared for further 
Iranian retaliation. 
These threats stem from the Presi-
dent’s fateful and reckless decision to 
withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a 
deal that was working by every meas-
ure, leaving us with no leverage and 
Iran with nothing to lose. 
We don’t need another war. Peace de-
mands action now. That is why Con-
gress must reassert its solemn con-
stitutional duty under Article I to de-
cide when and where the United States 
goes to war. This resolution does just 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, on Tuesday night, Iran 
launched at least a dozen ballistic missiles 
against two U.S. military bases in Iraq. 
Thankfully, there were no American casual-
ties, but I remain concerned about further Ira-
nian retaliation. 
These attacks come after President Trump 
ordered a drone strike that assassinated Ira-
nian Quds Force commander Major General 
Qasem Soleimani. 
Soleimani was a bad actor and master-
minded the killings of many U.S. soldiers in 
Iraq and Lebanon. He will not be missed. 
But killing Soleimani was supposed to make 
us safer. In reality, the President’s order has 
unleashed the dogs of war. 
What is unfolding now is the result of the 
Trump Administration’s incoherent foreign pol-
icy, stemming from its fateful and reckless de-
cision to withdraw the United States from our 
own agreement, the Iran nuclear deal. 
By all accounts, prior to our withdrawal, Iran 
was in compliance with the Joint Comprehen-
sive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 
It was only after our withdrawal, and re-im-
position of sanctions lifted under the agree-
ment, that Iran began to exceed its stockpile 
of low-enriched uranium, and then resume 
uranium enrichment. 
Following the Soleimani strike, Iran has 
vowed to ignore all restrictions set by the nu-
clear deal. This move has set in motion the 
very thing we were seeking to avoid—a nu-
clear-armed Iran. 
Our abrogation of the Iran nuclear agree-
ment leaves us with no leverage and Iran with 
nothing to lose. 
Iran and its proxy forces have engaged in a 
series of retaliatory actions: attacks on oil 
tankers in the Persian Gulf, downing an Amer-
ican drone in international waters, cruise mis-
sile attacks against Saudi oil plants, and rock-
et attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq. 
Secretary of State Pompeo claimed, ‘‘The 
world is a much safer place, and I can assure 
you, Americans in the region are much safer 
after the demise of Qasem Soleimani.’’ 
And yet, in the wake of Soleimani’s killing, 
the State Department has urged Americans to 
leave Iraq immediately whether by air or by 
land, and put Americans in the region on high 
alert. 
Two years ago, I warned that we were 
sleepwalking into an armed conflict. That the 
hidden scandal of the Iraq War—the manipula-
tion of intelligence to support a predetermined

January 9, 2020 
outcome—was now an overt political strategy 
to undermine the Iran nuclear deal. 
I fear now that these steps have brought us 
to the brink of war with Iran. 
According to Pompeo, ‘‘this was an intel-
ligence-based assessment that drove our deci-
sion-making process.’’ 
Yet, when asked about the imminent threat 
facing Americans from Soleimani, Pompeo 
pointed to a previous attack in Iraq that killed 
an American contractor and injured four 
servicemembers, not a new, imminent threat. 
Yesterday, the Trump Administration offered 
a sophomoric and utterly unconvincing briefing 
to members of Congress on the strike’s ration-
ale. 
President Trump’s decision to assassinate 
Soleimani was provocative and dispropor-
tionate and has endangered American lives 
and the security of the region. 
We don’t need another war. Peace de-
mands action now. 
That is why Congress must reassert its con-
stitutional authority to decide when and where 
the United States goes to war. 
Article I, Section 8 of the United States Con-
stitution states that ‘‘Congress shall have 
power . . . to declare war . . . and to raise 
and support armies’’ and other armed forces. 
And today the House of Representatives will 
make clear that Congress has not authorized 
President Trump to go to war with Iran. 
Neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorization 
for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) authorize 
the President to attack Iran or its senior offi-
cials. 
I urge my colleagues in both the House and 
the Senate to support this war powers resolu-
tion, and reclaim our solemn constitutional 
duty to determine when the United States puts 
our uniformed men and women in harm’s way. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Texas. 
This 
resolution 
is 
insincere 
and 
unserious. If my colleagues on the 
other side really want to limit the 
President’s ability to defend the United 
States, then they ought to take the 
vote and limit him and stand for that 
vote. 
Now, if you are not familiar with ter-
rorist Soleimani, let me just acquaint 
you. 
His reign of terror for Americans 
started with 241 marines in Beirut, 
Lebanon. He and his organization con-
tinued on to the Khobar Towers, hun-
dreds and hundreds of Americans dead 
by IEDs and thousands maimed. A 
servicemember from Pennsylvania in-
cinerated—incinerated—in the vehicle 
that he was in. 
Thank you terrorist Soleimani. 
The President does not desire war 
with Iran or anyone else, but Iran has 
been fighting us since 1979. 
I have got a news flash for everybody: 
They have been at war with the United 
States since they punched us in the 
face in 1979. 
Washington has been appeasing Iran, 
and the policy of appeasement has been 
getting Americans killed since 1979. 
542, that is the number of drone at-
tacks under the Obama administration 
in places like Yemen, Somalia, Paki-
stan. 
Oh, by the way, not the theatre of 
war for the United States. Not a peep, 
Madam Speaker, not a peep from the 
other side. 
The terrorist state of Iran cannot 
continue killing Americans and cannot 
have a nuclear bomb. Madam Speaker, 
it is time to stand up for America and 
Americans, including this President. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN), a longtime val-
ued member of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, this 
resolution imposes extraordinary re-
strictions on this President, an ex-
traordinary President who needs ex-
traordinary restrictions. 
This is best exemplified by the Presi-
dent’s gratuitous comment that he 
would hit cultural sites in Iran. Not 
only is that a war crime, but it is a 
mistake because it drives the Iranian 
people toward the regime while alien-
ating our European allies whose sup-
port for our sanctions is critical for 
them to work. 
The minority leader came to this 
floor and said Democrats were dupes of 
the Islamic Republic. I will compare 
my record of efforts against the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran with those of 
any other Member. 
You could argue whether Soleimani’s 
death makes us safer or not over the 
next few months. We have removed a 
terrorist mastermind from the battle-
field, but we have inspired the other 
terrorists. 
The real issue is the effect on Iran’s 
program. That program is more robust 
today than it was a week ago, as Iran 
has employed more centrifuges and is 
building a larger stockpile, all without 
our European friends, who are still in 
the JCPOA taking any action against 
Iran. 
There was no policy process on the 
golf course where the President made 
this decision. He heard not from a sin-
gle expert on Iranian politics, religion, 
or the economy. 
Our maximum pressure campaign is 
designed to put such pressure on the 
Iranian people that they choose not to 
endure it, but demand that the nuclear 
program be scaled back or ended, or 
that the regime that has that program 
be swept away. 
This assassination undercuts that ef-
fort by building support for the regime 
and its nuclear program with most of 
the 
Iranian 
people 
by 
making 
Soleimani a martyr in front of a Shiite 
population, a Shiite religion that lion-
izes martyrdom, we increase the likeli-
hood of an Iranian nuclear weapon. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentlemen 
from New York (Mr. ZELDIN), a member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong opposition to this resolution. 
I rise in total support of the decision to 
remove Qasem Soleimani. 
I have heard the use of the word ‘‘dis-
proportionate’’ from the Speaker. I 
have heard it here today on the House 
floor, and it is just a shocking word to 
be used to describe what took place. It 
makes me ask the question: At what 
point is it proportionate to take out a 
designated terrorist who kills 600 U.S. 
troops, wounds thousands of others, 
kills and wounds troops recently, and 
his proxies attack a U.S. Embassy? 
If anyone has any doubt as to what 
Qasem Soleimani was doing in Iraq at 
the time we took him out, you can 
look at the IRGC’s own words. The 
IRGC put out a statement saying that 
Soleimani and companions were on 
their way to ‘‘plan a confrontation 
against the new scheme of the Ameri-
cans to rebuild Daesh and the Takfiri 
groups in order to again disrupt Iraq’s 
security.’’ 
Who needs an intelligence briefing to 
determine that this is totally legiti-
mate? 
On behalf of all of those Gold Star 
families and all the Blue Star families, 
of anyone who is deployed now, anyone 
who is in harm’s way, if you need 
proof, go to Walter Reed. If you need 
proof, sit down with some of these Gold 
Star families who lost their sons, their 
daughters, their fathers, their mothers, 
their brothers, and their sisters be-
cause of this designated foreign ter-
rorist running a designated foreign ter-
rorist organization, who was sanc-
tioned by the United States, by EU, 
and by the United Nations. 
I say good riddance. 
Why are we having this debate? We 
should be coming together, not as Re-
publicans first, not as Democrats first. 
We should be coming together as Amer-
icans first and voting this down. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), a valued member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution sponsored by my good friend 
from 
Michigan, 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN. 
The Trump administration’s foreign 
policy failures have brought us to the 
brink of war. The administration has 
provided no evidence to demonstrate 
what imminent threat made Qasem 
Soleimani’s assassination and the per-
ilous, predictable fallout necessary. 
But they have demonstrated a shock-
ing dismissiveness as to what is at 
stake. 
On the threat of retaliation from 
Iran, Secretary Pompeo said it may be 
that there is a little noise here in the 
interim. President Trump said, if it 
happens, it happens. 
To the parents who are worried sick 
about their kids serving in the Middle 
East, it isn’t a little noise. Their chil-
dren’s lives are at stake. Those stakes 
make today’s vote necessary. 
The question before us is simple. Can 
we let this President drag us into an-
other war that will cost billions of tax-
payer dollars and, most importantly,

American lives? Will we at long last 
stand up and fulfill our constitutional 
duty to make decisions on war and 
peace? 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER). 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong opposition to the 
Democrats’ dangerous resolution to un-
dermine our national defense and allow 
unchecked Iranian aggression against 
the United States and our allies. 
This resolution intends to cripple our 
ability to protect American soldiers 
serving in the Middle East and at-
tempts to forbid the use of force 
against Iran, even if they are attacking 
Americans. 
I am shocked and saddened by the 
partisanship of this Chamber. I was 
proud when former President Obama 
succeeded in his decision to kill Osama 
bin Laden in Pakistan. I am proud that 
President 
Trump 
ended 
Qasem 
Soleimani’s brutal reign of terror that 
killed and maimed countless Ameri-
cans and coalition forces and threat-
ened many more to come. 
But, instead of uniting behind the 
President’s defensive position to strike 
one of the world’s most powerful ter-
rorists who was organizing attacks 
against Americans in Iraq, instead, 
many Democrats are arguing that the 
American President himself is guilty of 
aggression 
and 
escalation. 
This, 
Madam Speaker, is unconscionable. 
These are pictures from the Military 
Times showing the assault and the 
burning of our Embassy in Baghdad. 
I agree with the President that at-
tacking Americans is never acceptable 
and Iran should be held to account. 
When American lives hang in the bal-
ance, Article II of the Constitution em-
powers the President to use force to 
protect and defend our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this egregious, par-
tisan farce. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING), a valued 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the 
Environment. 
Mr. 
KEATING. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today we debate much more than the 
words on parchment that define our 
congressional responsibility. 
Long before I knew this legal respon-
sibility, I learned the moral responsi-
bility inherent to what must be the 
most sober and deliberate decision we 
can humanly muster. 
As a young boy, indelibly etched in 
my mind is the conversation with my 
grandmother the day she pulled a box 
out from underneath her bed, rev-
erently handing me the medals and 
final belongings of my uncle who was 
killed in action and telling me about 
her lost son. I wondered then what was 
so important to justify such a loss and 
what my uncle must have been think-
ing about. 
That day carried with me as I trav-
eled to Iraq as a newly elected Con-
gressman to visit our troops during a 
time of war. I remember having a con-
versation with a young marine. I asked 
him his personal thoughts about the 
goals of the war, what he thought, did 
he think it was justified. He told me: 
‘‘With all due respect, sir, that is your 
job. My job is to serve.’’ 
He was right. It is our job. That is 
why we are debating this, and that is 
why I am supporting this resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), the dis-
tinguished 
Republican 
Conference 
chair. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, the 
measure before us is an unconstitu-
tional political stunt meant to under-
mine the President of the United 
States. It will not become law, but it 
will embolden Iran. 
The Speaker and my colleagues who 
support this resolution ought to admit 
to the American people what they are 
doing, that is, undermining United 
States defense policy towards Iran. 
Qasem Soleimani, the lead architect 
and overseer of Iran’s web of terror is 
dead. This terrorist was responsible for 
the deaths of hundreds of American 
servicemembers, 
the 
killing 
of 
an 
American citizen in Iraq just 2 weeks 
ago, and the recent assaults against 
our Embassy in Baghdad. He was en-
gaged in planning for further deadly at-
tacks. 
But the Democrats in this body are 
so consumed by their hatred of Presi-
dent Trump that they will not even 
stand with him in support of the kill-
ing of the world’s deadliest terrorist. 
b 1530 
Instead, they have suggested a moral 
equivalence between the United States 
and Iran. The Speaker of the House 
even blamed America, describing the 
killing of Soleimani as ‘‘an unneces-
sary provocation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, what is a provo-
cation is the introduction of this reso-
lution, which shows doubt about Amer-
ican resolve. It makes war more, not 
less likely. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand united as Americans— 
to put partisan stunts aside—and to op-
pose this dangerous resolution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, this ad-
ministration says starving the Iranian 
economy is in defense of human rights, 
when it is an abuse of them; and that 
their withdrawal from the nuclear deal 
was a demonstration of American lead-
ership, when it was an abandonment of 
it. 
Escalation is deescalation, and war is 
peace. 
In fact, they are asking us to deny 
reality. The reality is that families of 
American soldiers and diplomats are 
being kept awake at night worrying. 
The Iraqi people who suffered decades 
of unjust war are now unjustly suf-
fering as their country becomes a bat-
tleground in a proxy war. 
The Iranian people have suffered be-
cause of maximum pressure and will 
suffer because of this escalation. 
John Quincy Adams said: 
America goes not abroad in search of mon-
sters. America’s glory is not dominion, but 
liberty. 
This administration has gone abroad 
in search of monsters to destroy. May 
God show us the way to freedom, inde-
pendence, and peace. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, make no 
mistake, this resolution is about the 
killing of Soleimani. He was a ter-
rorist, no different than al-Baghdadi, 
then 
al-Zarqawi, 
then 
Osama 
bin 
Laden, then Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
He was the head of a designated ter-
rorist organization no different than 
ISIS or al-Qaida. 
He was responsible for the deaths of 
our men and women—and I know most 
in here haven’t seen or smelled or 
touched that kind of death, but let me 
tell you about it. They were burned 
alive inside of their Humvees. Their 
lungs were scorched by the flames of 
the explosions. 
The vehicle fragments were blown 
into their skulls. Some of them were 
paralyzed. Some of them had their 
arms blown off. Some of them had their 
legs blown off. Some of them will never 
see again. Some of them will never be 
recognized again by those who knew 
them previously. 
Each and every one of them, they are 
the credible explanation for deleting 
this terrorist target from our world. 
And no doubt, it is dangerous to take 
out a terrorist target, but a coward is 
somebody who lacks the courage to en-
dure danger. This is the fundamental 
difference in voting ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ 
here. 
If you vote ‘‘no,’’ you understand 
that we would be justified to kill 100 
Soleimanis for just one of our heroes 
who have been killed by him. The dan-
ger would be worth it. 
For those who vote ‘‘yes,’’ they see 
that he has killed hundreds of our serv-
icemembers but can still not find the 
justification to kill him because, un-
like our fallen heroes, they lack the 
courage to endure danger. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), a valued member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to an unnecessary 
war with Iran in support of this resolu-
tion. 
Today, the question before us is: Are 
the American people more safe or less 
safe 
after 
the 
killing 
of 
Qasem 
Soleimani?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H101 
January 9, 2020 
As a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, I have significant concerns 
about the administration’s inability to 
answer this question and communicate 
a coherent strategy to avoid war and 
keep us safe. 
The American people have seen no 
evidence that killing Soleimani was a 
result of an imminent threat; no evi-
dence of a discernible political plan for 
our policy toward Iran moving forward. 
Questions of war and peace are the 
most fundamental of the issues that 
come before this Congress. They re-
quire deliberate and thoughtful deci-
sionmaking. This action by the admin-
istration was not that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS). 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I never thought that I would hear on 
this House floor an apology to the Ira-
nian people for an action that we took 
that was justified, taking out a ter-
rorist. I cannot believe it. 
And, yet, we just heard that on this 
House floor. We have a gentleman who 
gave his legs in service to this country 
and, yet, we are apologizing to the Ira-
nians with a nonbinding resolution 
that is nothing more than a press re-
lease, Madam Speaker. It has no effect. 
It doesn’t do anything. In fact, the Su-
preme Court says that. They know 
that. 
All they are doing is trying to get a 
press release to keep them from having 
a primary opponent. This is a sad, sad 
day. And, yet, here we are, having an-
other speech to try to take on the 
President of the United States for ac-
tually taking out a terrorist. 
I would ask my colleagues opposite: 
How many Americans does a terrorist 
have to kill before they join with us? Is 
600 not enough? Does it have to be 
1,000, 10,000, a million? At some point 
we have to stand up and let the long 
arm of justice go in and take out these 
terrorists. 
I am here to tell you today that this 
nonbinding resolution, indeed, they 
want to talk about their constitutional 
requirement, well, check with the Su-
preme Court. In 1983, they ruled that 
this has no effect. At least our Sen-
ators opposite, they know that. It has 
to be a joint resolution. 
And, yet, what is this vehicle nor-
mally designed for? For Soap Box 
Derbies. Well, at least that accom-
plishes something. All this does is 
emboldens our enemies to suggest that 
the American people are divided. 
But I am here to tell you that we are 
not divided. We are a safer country be-
cause of the actions of this President, 
the decisive actions of this President 
and our military. 
More important than that, this War 
Powers Act that got passed, it was a 
message that came out of a difficult 
time. But I want the message to be 
clear today. We are standing behind 
our military men and women. We have 
their back, and we will not yield. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, let me 
remind my friend that we, too, cherish 
our military and also have their backs. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY), chairwoman of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of this resolution. Congress has 
constitutional authority when it comes 
to one of the most important decisions 
any of us can make: to send our brave 
men and women of the Armed Forces 
into harm’s way in service of our coun-
try. 
Recent events demonstrate just how 
important this congressional role is. 
When the President decided to strike a 
high-level Iranian official, he made a 
decision that was provocative in the 
strongest sense of the word. He did that 
without any meaningful congressional 
consultation. 
The information that we have re-
ceived is woefully insufficient, includ-
ing the notification and the briefing 
provided by senior officials yesterday. 
Congress and the American people 
have no assurance that the President is 
acting as part of a well-thought-out 
strategy that makes Americans safer 
rather than sets us on a war path. 
I am deeply opposed to an unauthor-
ized war with Iran. That is why I sup-
port this resolution, which reiterates 
that only Congress can declare war and 
that we have not done so here. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER). 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I oppose this dangerous reso-
lution. Iran has been at war with us for 
40 years. They held Americans hostage 
in Tehran. They murdered our marines 
in Beirut. They killed hundreds, if not 
thousands, of American servicemem-
bers in Iraq. 
In recent months, Iran shot down a 
U.S. drone, they killed an American 
citizen, and they organized an attack 
on our embassy. 
So let’s be clear: General Soleimani 
was the mastermind behind these at-
tacks. Soleimani was in Iraq claiming 
imminent attacks on our servicemem-
bers, our diplomats, and our Iraqi al-
lies. 
Soleimani was an enemy combatant 
and a lawful target. As a Navy JAG, I 
prosecuted terrorists in Iraq. I was ac-
tually stationed right across from our 
embassy in Baghdad, and I witnessed 
these threats on our Armed Forces. So 
I applaud President Trump, I applaud 
our warfighters, and I applaud our in-
telligence community for reaching an 
incredible outcome against Iran. 
Soleimani’s death was a win for 
America, for freedom, and for peace. In 
supporting this resolution, Democrats 
are choosing to stand with their far- 
left radical base rather than standing 
up against Iran. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the resolution. Article I, 
Section 8 of the Constitution grants 
Congress the power to declare war. 
This was not a matter of great con-
troversy among the Founders, because 
going to war is the most portentous de-
cision that a nation can make. And in 
our democracy, it is a decision to be 
undertaken by the people through the 
Congress, and not by one person. 
We are all enormously grateful that 
no U.S. personnel were killed in Iran’s 
missile strikes, and I hope that the 
President will take advantage of the 
momentary calm to deescalate the sit-
uation. 
But we cannot assume peace will 
hold indefinitely because of the impul-
sive actions of this President which 
have so often brought us to the brink 
of war. 
Qasem Soleimani was a malign force 
responsible for the death of many 
Americans, but after the briefings I 
have received, I have no confidence 
that there is some broad strategy at 
work, or that the policies of the Presi-
dent are doing anything but increasing 
the dangers to the American people. 
That is a recipe for disaster, one 
which increases the likelihood of stum-
bling into a war that the American 
people do not want and Congress has 
not authorized. 
The resolution before the House 
today is a step toward reasserting our 
constitutional duty to rein in a Presi-
dent whose unilateral actions have iso-
lated us from our allies, increased the 
risk of a nuclear-armed Iran, and made 
us less safe. 
Finally, I hope the vote today is the 
first of a broader reassertion of Con-
gress’ war powers including the sunset 
or repeal of the 2001 and 2002 Authoriza-
tions for Use of Military Force which 
have been stretched beyond recogni-
tion. 
It is past time for Congress to do our 
job and not simply write the executive 
a blank check. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. WATKINS). 
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I 
spent somewhere around 81⁄2 years in 
conflict environments and post-conflict 
environments between Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. And all that time I knew 
many people who suffered at the hands 
of Qasem Soleimani. 
One in particular takes me back to 
2006 or 2007. I was smoking and joking 
at the embassy in Baghdad. I was doing 
so with a friend—really a brother, a 
West Point classmate—who shortly 
thereafter went out on a mission and 
was ultimately killed in a complex at-
tack perpetrated by Qasem Soleimani.

H102 
January 9, 2020 
I understand that action leads to 
risk, but inaction leads to more risk in 
the long run. And when searching for 
this divine strategy, look to what tac-
tical operators know to be true, and 
that is, when we go throughout our 
work on the ground with the assault 
rifle in one hand, a sat phone in the 
other, we need to know that should 
anything happen to us, our President is 
going to have the freedom to rain fire 
down upon our enemies, and I am 
thankful for that. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT), an esteemed member the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
b 1545 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the resolution. 
Without a coherent strategy, such 
actions as the recent ones that oc-
curred in Iraq present a dangerous 
move toward the United States’ engag-
ing in a war that the American people 
do not want. 
Today, we move to reclaim power 
that the executive branch has tried to 
usurp from Congress. We assert our 
constitutional authority to determine 
if the country ought to go to war, and 
we send a message loud and clear that 
we do not want to go to war. 
We will not engage in reckless hos-
tilities to endanger American lives, 
American interests, and our American 
values without fully evaluating immi-
nent threat. We must continue to as-
sert that, without new authorizations 
from 
Congress, 
this 
administration 
cannot engage in offensive military ac-
tions. That is what our Framers in-
tended. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. HURD), who is a former CIA 
officer. 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
right now is not the time for a partisan 
exercise that could be used as propa-
ganda by the ayatollahs. Instead, Con-
gress should be united in condemning a 
regime that has been attacking Amer-
ica and our allies for 40 years. 
Qasem Soleimani was the head of the 
most dangerous and well-armed ter-
rorist organization in the world, and 
his death has removed a major ter-
rorist leader off the battlefield. This 
decision followed repeated rocket at-
tacks by Iranian proxies on American 
forces and an attempt to storm our em-
bassy in Baghdad. 
This decision was based on intel-
ligence that our Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff has described as compel-
ling, imminent, and very clear, as 
Soleimani 
was 
planning 
attacks 
against our troops. This is an assess-
ment with which I concur. 
No one wants another war in the Mid-
dle East. Instead of tying the hands of 
our military, we should be sending a 
strong message to the Iranian regime 
that there will be consequences for 
their reign of terror, and we will pro-
tect our citizens at all costs. 
The Iranian regime has killed over 
600 American troops in Iraq. They have 
killed over 1,500 of their own people for 
peacefully protesting. They have lied 
to the world about their nuclear arse-
nal. 
Appeasing them will only make fu-
ture conflict and bloodshed more like-
ly. That is why I wish today, instead of 
this partisan exercise, that we were 
sending to the Government of Iran a 
clearer message that no elected official 
in America is supportive of its behav-
ior. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DEFAZIO). 
Mr. 
DEFAZIO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Bush’s invasion of Iraq was 
the first foreign policy mistake in the 
history of the United States based on 
fake intelligence, and President Trump 
took us to the brink of war with Iran 
with an impulsive act at the end of last 
week that would be even more disas-
trous than the war with Iraq, which is 
still reverberating throughout the re-
gion. 
Some on that side say: Oh, you are 
not with the troops; you are apolo-
gizing. 
No, we are not. We are reasserting 
the constitutional duty that we are 
sworn to in this House of Representa-
tives. Congress and only Congress can 
declare war. Once we have declared 
war, then the President of the United 
States as Commander in Chief can con-
duct it, as much as this gentleman 
could. 
This is just a step. We need to repeal 
the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force against Iraq based on fake intel-
ligence because that was his lawyer’s 
rationalization of why they could do 
this in Iraq, a sovereign nation, with-
out their permission. 
We also have to reform the War Pow-
ers Act because the War Powers Act 
itself does not reflect our constitu-
tional authority. 
Finally, we have to pass an amend-
ment to prohibit a hostile action 
against Iran without authority from 
Congress. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I op-
pose this resolution that is designed to 
embarrass our President in front of the 
world and, in reality, gives comfort to 
Iran’s leadership. It weakens America 
and emboldens our enemies. 
This resolution is not needed. The 
War Powers Act is still in effect, and 
the President is not conducting combat 
operations against Iran. He wants dees-
calation; he does not want war. 
He is not doing what President 
Obama did in Libya. What the Presi-
dent did was a onetime defensive oper-
ation, 
when 
he 
targeted 
General 
Soleimani. 
Let us be clear: Soleimani murdered 
609 Americans in Iraq. His proxies at-
tacked our embassy, and the Quds 
Force he commanded shed blood across 
the world. He even attempted ter-
rorism right here in Washington, D.C. 
He was the number one threat to 
Israel, and he was anti-Semitism per-
sonified. 
I knew who Soleimani was when I 
was in Iraq. We were targeted by rock-
ets every single day from Iranian prox-
ies trained in, funded by, and armed by 
Iran and sometimes led by Iranian 
commanders, and fellow Americans 
died. 
The targeting of Soleimani is justice 
for the 609 families who had a son or 
daughter murdered by this guy and the 
thousands missing an arm or a leg be-
cause of his savagery. 
In bringing up this resolution, the 
Speaker said that our targeting of 
Soleimani was disproportionate. It is 
disgusting. This guy killed 609 Ameri-
cans in Iraq alone. He was the master-
mind. 
Does it take 100 more? 200 more? 300 
more? It is vile. 
Our strike was also defensive. Gen-
eral Milley said that he saw some of 
the best intelligence he has ever seen 
and that it clearly showed Soleimani 
was in Baghdad, planning an imminent 
attack on Americans. To deny this is 
to call General Milley a liar. 
This resolution weakens America and 
gives hope to the Ayatollah that we 
don’t have the resolve to stand up to 
these attacks. A house divided will not 
stand. I pray wise leadership prevails 
and that we unify to oppose Iranian 
terror that murdered hundreds of our 
fellow citizens. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), who has worked 
very hard on these issues for many 
years. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding and also for his tremendous 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H. Con. Res. 83. This critical 
resolution helps put a check on this ad-
ministration’s reckless and irrational 
unauthorized military actions against 
Iran. 
The American people do not want, 
and we cannot allow, another unneces-
sary war of choice in the Middle East. 
This resolution is an important step in 
our efforts to prevent that from hap-
pening. This will restore our constitu-
tional duty over military action. 
Also, we must take up my bill, H.R. 
2456, to repeal the 2002 AUMF and Con-
gressman KHANNA’s bill to prohibit any 
funds for a war with Iran, absent an ex-
plicit authorization. My 2002 AUMF 
amendment was included with bipar-
tisan support in the House and passed 
in the 2020 NDAA bill, but it was 
stripped by Republicans from the final 
bill. Now, I know why. 
Madam Speaker, this administration 
has falsely claimed that the 2002 AUMF 
could be used as a congressional au-
thorization to attack Iran, which is 
completely outrageous. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H103 
January 9, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 15 sec-
onds. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me be clear: U.S. military 
deployment and operations carried out 
pursuant to the 2002 AUMF officially 
concluded in 2011. Maintaining this au-
thorization is not only dangerous, but 
it is irresponsible. 
Madam Speaker, it is past time to re-
turn to diplomacy and end these end-
less wars, and I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on 
H. Con. Res. 83. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO), who is 
a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf 
war and a current member of the Mis-
sissippi National Guard. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong opposition to this 
resolution. 
Let’s be clear with the American peo-
ple: Democrats wrote this bill before 
being briefed by senior intelligence of-
ficials on the strike that eliminated 
Soleimani, a well-known terrorist. 
At the end of the day, we all know 
that this man was responsible for the 
death of thousands of individuals, in-
cluding over 600 American servicemem-
bers. President Trump was absolutely 
right to respond and acted within his 
constitutional authority to protect 
American citizens. He owes no one an 
apology. Feelings can be healed, but 
dead Americans cannot be resurrected. 
My question for those on the other 
side of the aisle who are hellbent on 
undermining this President over polit-
ical differences is: How many more 
Americans did you want to die before 
President Trump acted? 
Let’s reflect. President Obama au-
thorized over 540 drone strikes, killing 
over 3,700 people and more than 320 ci-
vilians. Not a single one was author-
ized by Congress. 
As a veteran and member of our 
United States military, I am ashamed 
of the behavior I am witnessing now. 
Our military deserves better, and so do 
the American people. During a time 
when our country should unite behind 
our Commander in Chief, this resolu-
tion turns us against ourselves. I sup-
port our men and women in uniform 
and hope my colleagues on the left will 
come to their senses to do the same. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TED LIEU), who is a distin-
guished member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman ENGEL for 
his leadership. 
I previously served in Active Duty in 
the United States military, and if we 
are going to put our troops in harm’s 
way, we better have a strategy. Unfor-
tunately, we don’t have a strategy 
from the Trump administration. We 
just have reckless and impulsive deci-
sionmaking by the President. 
Let me just ask a very simple ques-
tion: What are our goals with Iran? 
Is it to get them to come back to the 
negotiating table on the nuclear pro-
gram? Well, we are further away from 
that goal now because they have an-
nounced they are no longer going to 
abide by limits on the nuclear pro-
gram. 
Is the goal to get the regime to col-
lapse? We are further from that goal, 
too, because the Iranian people who 
previously were protesting their gov-
ernment are rallying behind their lead-
ership. 
Or is the goal to work with our allies 
to contain Iran? Well, we are further 
away from that goal, too, because the 
Iraqi parliament just voted to kick us 
out of their country. 
Madam Speaker, we are less safe 
than we were a week ago. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this bipartisan resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, many of 
the senior leadership on the other side 
of the aisle voted for the 2002 AUMF on 
Iraq, including the chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, the major-
ity leader, and the chairman of the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence. 
The AUMF in 2002 gave this Presi-
dent every bit of authority he needed 
to go after a terrorist in Iraq. In fact, 
the terrorist that he killed, Soleimani, 
was designated under Barack Obama 
Executive Order No. 13224 as a Spe-
cially Designated Global Terrorist in 
2011. 
Where was the outrage when Presi-
dent Obama was using the same AUMF 
as justification for dropping bombs in 
countries like Yemen or Syria, or vio-
lating the sovereign airspace of Paki-
stan, which we all agreed with, but vio-
lated the airspace of Pakistan to go in 
and kill Osama bin Laden? 
We were fine with that. This is a Spe-
cially Designated Global Terrorist who 
deserved death after he was responsible 
for 600-plus American deaths, atrocious 
and abysmal acts. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, there 
are two times we are going to be called 
to account for our votes here in Con-
gress. One is at our next election; the 
other is when we draw our last breath 
of air. I am more concerned about the 
latter. 
This vote isn’t about supporting or 
opposing President Trump. I voted for 
President Trump. I plan to vote for 
President Trump again. 
This vote is about exercising our con-
stitutional 
authority. 
More 
impor-
tantly, it is about our moral obligation 
to decide when and where our troops 
are going to be asked to give their 
lives. 
Congress needs to do more of what we 
are doing here today. We need to de-
bate our involvement in Afghanistan, 
and then we need to bring our troops 
home. We need to debate our involve-
ment in Iraq, and then we need to bring 
our troops home. 
We certainly don’t need another war. 
If we do go to war, it needs to be with 
the blessing and the support of the peo-
ple and a mission that our soldiers can 
accomplish. 
We do that by following the vision of 
our Founding Fathers: We debate it 
here on the floor of the House. 
That is what this resolution is about, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCA-
LISE), who is the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this resolution. If you look 
at what they are attempting to do, 
there has been a lot of talk about the 
2002 AUMF, Madam Speaker, and I am 
sure, as Congress has over the years, 
we will continue to have a healthy de-
bate over what that proper role should 
be of Congress as it relates to the 2002 
AUMF. But that is not what this de-
bate is about. 
When you read the resolution, in 
fact, just by its own name, this is not 
an act of Congress. This isn’t even 
changing the law. So if you want to 
have a sincere debate over what that 
power should be that Congress gave to 
the executive branch, then let’s have 
that debate. But don’t try to pass some 
fig leaf resolution that is only intended 
to try to undermine the President in 
the middle of a conflict with the 
world’s largest state sponsor of ter-
rorism, Iran. 
There is no dispute about how bad of 
an evil terrorist Soleimani was, yet 
here you hear all of these equivo-
cations: Oh, Soleimani was bad person 
but. 
Madam Speaker, how can you sit 
here and try to apologize for the things 
that he did by saying that taking him 
out was wrong? 
This world is a safer place with 
Soleimani gone. If you want to apolo-
gize to anybody, go apologize to the 
families of those hundreds of men and 
women in our uniform who are dead at 
the hands of Soleimani, not only the 
people whom he had already killed but 
the even more Americans whom at the 
very time of his death he was plotting 
to kill. 
b 1600 
How much is enough? At what point 
do we say: Take him off the face of this 
planet so he can’t kill more innocent 
people? That is what was ultimately 
done. 
We support President Trump in his 
efforts at keeping America safe, just 
like we supported President Obama 
when he took out Osama bin Laden, an-
other evil terrorist who had the blood 
of thousands of Americans on his 
hands. 
If we are going to be serious about 
keeping this country safe, absolutely,

January 9, 2020 
there is a role for Congress to play, but 
you have got to support the efforts of 
your Commander in Chief to carry out 
his constitutional duty which he has to 
keep this country safe. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his leadership in bring-
ing this important opportunity for us 
to express our concern about the Presi-
dent’s actions. I salute him and the 
support on the other side of the aisle 
for this legislation. 
As we know, last week, the Trump 
administration conducted a provoca-
tive and disproportionate military air-
strike 
targeting 
high-level 
Iranian 
military officials, and he did so with-
out consulting Congress. 
When I first heard from the adminis-
tration, the Secretary of Defense and 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I 
said: Why did you not consult Congress 
in this change in approach? 
They said: Because we had to keep 
this close. We had to keep this close. 
You had to keep it close from the 
Gang of 8, the leadership of the Con-
gress? 
We had to keep it close because we 
didn’t want the word get out. 
Well, we deserve the respect from the 
administration, and the Congress de-
serves, by dint of the Constitution, the 
requirement of the administration to 
consult with Congress. 
We know full well, better than many 
in the administration, the importance 
of classified information. We know 
that 
we 
are 
supposed 
to 
support 
sources and methods. We also know 
that the consultation that they would 
give to us does not enable us to divulge 
any information. 
So who are they keeping it close 
from? They admitted, this administra-
tion, they were keeping it close from 
the Congress of the United States, and 
they did so. 
Now, they did a classified presen-
tation yesterday, which their own 
party members, Republican Senators, 
said it was the most demeaning and 
worst classified briefing that they had 
had. I, myself, think there is stiff com-
petition for that designation of ‘‘worst 
presentation’’ by this administration 
in a classified briefing. 
But all that is to say that the Con-
stitution of the United States calls for 
there to be cooperation when we decide 
about initiating hostilities. Congress 
has the right to declare war. When do 
you decide that it is war? When do you 
decide it is just hostilities? When does 
that end? What line do you cross? 
But, with the President’s actions last 
week, he endangered our servicemen 
and -women, our diplomats and others 
by taking a serious risk of escalation 
of tensions with Iran. 
This does not come with any respect 
for Iran. We know what bad actors they 
are in the world. I, from my intel-
ligence 
background, 
know 
that 
Soleimani was somebody whom we do 
not mourn the loss of. He did very evil 
things in the world. But we also know 
that when we take an action, we have 
to understand the ramifications of it. 
Others could have taken Soleimani 
out. Israel could have taken Soleimani 
out, but they didn’t. They didn’t. 
So, that has happened. That is where 
it is. As we go forward, it is really im-
portant for us to address the param-
eters of the War Powers Act, and that 
is what we are doing here today. 
The Members of Congress have seri-
ous and urgent concerns about the ad-
ministration’s decision to engage—I 
use the term ‘‘decision’’ loosely—to en-
gage in hostilities against Iran, and it 
is about a lack of strategy. What is the 
strategy to move forward? 
Again, they did not consult with Con-
gress. They gave a presentation that, 
by their own side of the aisle, has been 
described as demeaning and the worst. 
And then they tell Members to go read 
the classified documents. 
Classified? Why are these documents 
classified? Why can’t the American 
people know? 
We understand redactions of sources 
and methods and the rest, but, if you 
read that document, you would know 
there is no reason for it to be classi-
fied; and without going into any sub-
stantive matters of what happened yes-
terday in the classified briefing, it is 
fair to say that Members were told to 
go read other documents which are re-
dacted and, in many cases, classified 
unnecessarily. 
Our concerns were not addressed by 
the President’s insufficient War Powers 
authorization, which was classified in 
its entirety, leaving the Congress and 
the public in the dark about our na-
tional security, and our concerns were 
not addressed by the administration’s 
briefing yesterday. 
Today, to honor our duty to keep the 
American people safe—that is our first 
responsibility, to protect and defend; 
we must keep the American people 
safe—the House will pass a War Powers 
Resolution to limit the President’s 
military actions regarding Iran. 
Congress is reasserting our long-es-
tablished oversight responsibilities as 
we mandate that, if no further Con-
gressional action is taken, the adminis-
tration’s military hostilities with re-
gard to Iran must end. 
We salute Congresswoman SLOTKIN 
for her leadership in this resolution. 
She is a former CIA and Department of 
Defense analyst specializing in Shiite 
militias, who served multiple tours in 
the region under both Democratic and 
Republican Presidents. 
It is important to know, because I 
heard the distinguished whip on the 
other side of the aisle ask: How come it 
is just a concurrent resolution? It is 
because, under the War Powers Act, 
that is one of the options that is pro-
vided. You can do a joint resolution, 
House resolution, or you can do a con-
current resolution. 
The value and the beauty and the ex-
quisite nature of a concurrent resolu-
tion is that it does not have to be 
signed by the President of the United 
States. The Congress of the United 
States, in its full power and full voice, 
can speak in a united way about what 
the War Powers Act should look like, 
and that should count for something to 
our colleagues who serve in the Con-
gress of the United States. So, under 
the authority of the War Powers Act 
that gives us this option, we take this 
opportunity to do so. 
I implore the administration to work 
with Congress to advance immediate, 
effective, deescalatory strategy that 
prevents further violence. 
I also salute this resolution because 
it does give opportunity for the admin-
istration to act under certain cir-
cumstances which are part of the War 
Powers Act. 
Madam Speaker, in December, a 
group of us, in a bipartisan way, trav-
eled to Belgium and Luxembourg to ob-
serve the 75th anniversary of the Bat-
tle of the Bulge and who served in that 
battle. One of our Members, ANNIE 
KUSTER, her father served in that, and 
she has letters from him at that time. 
Other Members, on both sides of the 
aisle—Mr. SETH MOULTON, his grand-
father served in the Battle of the 
Bulge—also on the Republican side of 
the aisle, the House and in the Senate. 
And why I bring it up is this. That 
Battle of the Bulge was a decisive bat-
tle in World War II. It was a surprise 
attack, really, by the Germans. It was 
a bloody battle. We lost 19,000 Ameri-
cans—19,000 Americans—in that Battle 
of the Bulge. 
On the days that we were there, when 
I was listening to the description of it 
from the veterans who served, it sound-
ed almost like Washington crossing the 
Delaware, because it was December, as 
it was in the United States in the be-
ginning of our fight for independence. 
Supplies were insufficient. The camou-
flage for snow was not adequate. Our 
veterans, our then men in uniform 
were exposed—nurses, too. And it was a 
triumph that was very decisive in 
World War II. 
And why I bring it up is because, 
when there was the observance of it—it 
was parts of 3 days we were there for it. 
But at the close of it, there was a cere-
mony that included a speech by the 
King of Belgium, the Grand Duke of 
Luxembourg—two of the places where 
this all took place—and the President 
of Germany, who spoke beautifully 
about Germany now, saying: When you 
freed Luxembourg and Belgium, you 
also freed the Germans. 
What a beautiful statement. 
But the close of it was from a veteran 
who served in the Battle of the Bulge, 
in his nineties. He was a teenager in 
the war. We saw the foxholes in which 
they fought, they lost their comrades 
in arms. He talked about the brother-
hood, and he talked about allies, and 
he talked about the fight. At the end of 
the speech, the veteran said: I don’t

know if I should say this, but I will. My 
message to all of you is pray for peace. 
Pray for peace. 
That is what we should be doing is 
moving toward peace, not escalation of 
hostilities where that can be avoided. 
Not because we believe that the other 
side has good motivations or that 
Soleimani was not a bad person. 
It is not because of what they are; it 
is because of who we are as Americans: 
a country that is committed to peace 
and security and prepared to protect 
and defend, as President Kennedy said, 
fight any fight, fight any foe, pay any 
price to keep the American people safe, 
but to not be frivolous and cavalier 
about how we decide to show strength 
when it really is more of an escalation 
than a deescalation. 
So it is sad because you would think 
that, any time we would engage in such 
an important change in approach, we 
would be working together, consulting 
together, respecting the approach that 
each side takes to all of this and, hope-
fully, just be on one side of it all. 
So I think this is very important. It 
doesn’t do everything, and it is said: 
Well, it doesn’t do this; it doesn’t do 
that. 
We should never be judging legisla-
tion, necessarily, for what it doesn’t 
do, but respecting it for what it does 
do, and what this does is very impor-
tant for the security of our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the ranking 
member of the Committee on Home-
land Security. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this brazen political stunt. 
Qasem Soleimani was a vicious ter-
rorist who built a cult following on the 
backs of dead Americans. He armed 
Hezbollah, KH, and other Iranian prox-
ies who killed American troops and our 
allies throughout the Middle East. The 
Homeland Security and Defense De-
partments have kept close watch on his 
terror campaigns for years. 
Soleimani was not visiting Baghdad 
because it was a great holiday destina-
tion. He was there to meet the leader 
of a terrorist group that killed an 
American just days before. 
Our President used the law and his 
constitutional 
authority 
as 
Com-
mander in Chief to eliminate this ter-
rorist mastermind before he could kill 
again. 
Democrats immediately responded by 
doubting our intelligence and dis-
missing the expertise of our military 
leaders. Now they bring this resolution 
to the floor that maligns our Presi-
dent, undermines our national secu-
rity, and makes a martyr of a man who 
killed nearly 600 Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the majority 
whip. 
b 1615 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for yielding the time. 
Speaking out against the Vietnam 
War in 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. implored: ‘‘We must move past in-
decision to action. We must find new 
ways to speak for peace. If we do not 
act, we shall surely be dragged down 
the long, dark, and shameful corridors 
of time reserved for those who possess 
power 
without 
compassion, 
might 
without morality, and strength with-
out sight.’’ 
Dr. King’s words are just as apropos 
today. President Trump, in ordering a 
significant military strike, without 
seeking authorization, or even con-
sultation with Congress, has brought 
us to the brink of war. 
The Constitution of this great coun-
try gives the solemn power to declare 
war to the people’s representatives in 
Congress, not one person in the White 
House, whoever that might be. 
With this resolution, Congress is act-
ing to uphold our constitutional re-
sponsibility. If the President believes 
military action against Iran is war-
ranted, this resolution, and the Con-
stitution, require him to make the case 
to Congress and receive authorization. 
Mr. Speaker, I truly regret that we 
find ourselves in the position we are 
today. The Trump administration’s 
policy toward Iran, abandoning the nu-
clear deal rather than building on it, 
while escalating tensions instead, is an 
unwise application of American power, 
might, and strength. 
The 
strike 
against 
General 
Soleimani, a bad man who no American 
mourns, drags us closer to another 
long, dark, and shameful corridor to an 
unnecessary war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of 
the resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, our 
Constitution is clear that only Con-
gress can start a war, but only the 
President can wage it. Congress started 
this war with the AUMF in 2002. It is 
still in effect. 
The Founders didn’t want one indi-
vidual getting us into a war; but once 
in it, they didn’t want 535 squabbling 
prima donnas second-guessing every 
decision on the battlefield. 
President Trump needed no other 
reason to order the attack that killed 
Soleimani in Iraq, beyond the simple 
fact that he was acting as an enemy 
combatant against U.S. forces in a war 
zone in which the Congress had author-
ized the President to take military ac-
tion. 
I happen to believe the AUMF was a 
colossal mistake, but this resolution 
doesn’t correct that mistake. It com-
pounds it by deliberately undermining 
the position of the United States Gov-
ernment and the Armed Forces that we 
sent to Iraq at a perilous moment, 
which makes it not only unconstitu-
tional, but disgraceful. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CASTRO), the vice chair of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, and the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
in the last few days, the American peo-
ple have been unwillingly taken to the 
brink of war at the direction of this ad-
ministration. 
Through reckless actions, the White 
House has unified the Iranian public, 
alienated our partners in Iraq and Eu-
rope, undermined the fight against 
ISIS, and left the United States more 
isolated than before; all in just 1 week, 
and without the consent of this Con-
gress. 
This is a grave and serious moment 
in our country. 
Two days ago, our brave men and 
women in uniform came under fire 
from 22 Iranian missiles, in harm’s way 
because of their Commander in Chief. 
Every American owes a debt of grati-
tude to our military for its courage and 
sacrifice. For that reason, a decision 
that risks troops’ well-being must only 
be made thoughtfully and with the in-
formed consent of the public and this 
Congress. 
As a Member of Congress, my biggest 
priority is to protect the safety of the 
American people, at home and abroad. 
This can only be done by defending 
Congress’ 
constitutional 
authority 
over declaring war. 
For that reason, I urge us to support 
this resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1

isiana (Mr. ABRAHAM).

H106 
January 9, 2020 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the resolution before us 
today. 
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitu-
tion states: ‘‘Congress shall have the 
power to declare war.’’ The Founders 
were unequivocal. Only Congress has 
the power to authorize acts of war. 
Today, we bring forth this resolution 
to honor our Founding Fathers’ vision 
for our country, for our government, 
one whose very survival hinges on the 
separation of powers and each branch’s 
respect for the others’ authority. 
At this moment we, as a Congress, 
have an opportunity to pursue de- 
escalatory actions that protect the 
lives of our Armed Forces, diplomats, 
and civilians. I implore the President 
and this administration to work with 
this Congress in this effort. 
Today marks this first step. We must 
aggressively pursue diplomacy so that 
no lives are lost. I encourage all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join in that pursuit. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of a President 
who carried out his oath of office. 
I am afraid the reason we are here 
today, again, is out of pure opposition 
to this President, and not the serious 
national security issues at hand. 
Make 
no 
mistake; 
terrorist 
Soleimani is responsible for the deaths 
of hundreds of Americans, including 
those that my friend and colleague, 
RALPH ABRAHAM, just read. Hundreds of 
Americans; and he was plotting to kill 
many more. 
The President used his full legal au-
thority to take defensive action and 
eliminate this brutal terrorist. The 
world is safer today because of it. 
In times like these, we need to come 
together as a country and stand behind 
our men and women in uniform. Who-
ever occupies the White House should 
have the ability to direct and address 
threats and prevent American blood-
shed. 
Just 48 hours ago, Iran attacked U.S. 
military personnel; and yet, we are 
hastily voting on this partisan resolu-
tion that will weaken national secu-
rity. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this political show resolution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I rise 
in support of the War Powers Resolu-
tion as an original cosponsor. This is a 
grave and pivotal moment in American 
history, and we must be greatly con-
cerned for the security of our troops 
and the safety of the American people. 
We live in an era of hybrid warfare 
and high-intensity reaction. One reck-
less military strike can incentivize 
countermeasures, not just in the imme-
diate region, but thousands of miles 
away by Iran’s proxies. Wise use of 
force matters. 
Without congressional authorization, 
and in defiance of our Constitution, 
this President ordered an unprece-
dented strike on Iran’s top generals. 
There is no doubt Soleimani was a 
fierce enemy of liberty. However, this 
Lone Ranger attack by the President 
risks all-out war, greater instability in 
Iraq and Iran, losing the edge we have 
gained at such great cost; and some of 
those names have been put on the 
RECORD today. 
We must protect against further at-
tacks on our servicemembers and at-
tacks on U.S. assets, wherever they 
might exist. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Ohio an additional 
15 seconds. 
Ms. KAPTUR. To those ends, the 
American people deserve full trans-
parency. The President must take 
steps to de-escalate this highly volatile 
situation in a most ungovernable part 
of the world. 
Let us rigorously pursue, with our al-
lies, turning back Iran’s development 
of nuclear weapons. And let us do all 
we can to uphold our beloved Constitu-
tion, put raging bulls back in their 
cages, and make the American people 
safer. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend and fellow Texan, 
Ranking Member MCCAUL, for his 
strong leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to 
weaponize impeachment to discredit 
the President. It is a whole other thing 
to handcuff our Commander in Chief 
and jeopardize the safety of our sol-
diers and prevent them from defending 
themselves. 
Thankfully, this is a partisan resolu-
tion that is going nowhere. But it is 
also disturbing insight into the naive 
and impotent ideology of appeasement 
that invited Russia into Syria, created 
ISIS in Iraq, and emboldened Iran to 
terrorize and brutally murder through-
out the Middle East. 
This is not a resolution. This is a re-
treat, a de facto apology. But for what? 
For ridding the world of a brutal ter-
rorist with American blood on his 
hands? 
If this resolution were to become law, 
Mr. Speaker, it would be a death war-
rant, and not for the worst of terror-
ists, but for the best of Americans, our 
sons and daughters on the battlefield 
who would be left defenseless, sitting 
ducks for a murderous mob of mullahs 
in Iran and Iranian-backed militias 
throughout the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it 
is past time for Congress to exert our 
authority over the questions of war 
and peace; and I am proud to vote for 
this concurrent resolution to invoke 
the War Powers Act in order to re-
strain this reckless President. 
This vote would halt military oper-
ations and force the President to come 
to Congress to authorize any further 
acts of war. 
The 
President, 
remarkably, 
said: 
‘‘All is well.’’ 
Well, Mr. President, it is not well. 
Iran announced that it would withdraw 
from the nuclear agreement and will 
begin to resume its nuclear weapons 
plan. The United States has been 
forced to stop its actions against ISIS. 
Iraq is likely to expel the United 
States from its country, fulfilling what 
has 
been 
a 
dream, 
actually, 
of 
Soleimani. 
Our European allies are angry be-
cause they were not alerted, and our 
actions have united the people of Iraq 
against us, and the people of Iran are 
together now. 
Mr. President, America is not safer 
because of what you have done. And we 
must pass this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 1630 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader 
of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Let us hope that demagoguery will 
not play too great a part in the consid-
eration of this piece of legislation. I 
just heard one of my colleagues on the 
other side mischaracterize the position 
of my party and of this resolution. 
This resolution is the law. This reso-
lution is consistent with not only the 
law, the War Powers Act, but the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
I thank Representative SLOTKIN for 
authoring this resolution, as well as 
Chairman SMITH, Chairman ENGEL, 
Representative KHANNA, Representa-
tive LEE, and others who have been 
working hard to ensure that Congress 
maintains its role as a coequal branch 
of government when it comes to mat-
ters of war and peace. 
This President, as we have seen, has 
consistently treated the legislative 
branch as inferior to the executive 
branch. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, we have 
had numerous votes on this floor last 
year to stand up for the coequal status 
of the Congress of the United States. 
Too often, our Republican friends have 
sided with the executive department, 
diminishing the authority and the posi-
tion of the Congress of the United 
States. This is not about this Presi-
dent, nor is it about shrinking from 
confronting terrorism and terrorists. 
Again and again, we have seen this 
President ignore Congress’ directives 
on appropriations, including by shift-
ing money away from the military to

fund his costly and ineffective border 
wall. This President has refused to dis-
burse emergency funding for disaster 
relief that Congress allocated to help 
the people of Puerto Rico and other 
places where Americans are in need of 
help. This President withheld congres-
sionally appropriated funding to help 
Ukraine repel Russian terrorism. 
After criticizing his predecessor for 
the use of executive orders, President 
Trump has doubled down on using 
them to circumvent the will of Con-
gress and the American people. 
This resolution is to say: Mr. Presi-
dent, obey the law, obey the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America, 
which gives Congress the sole author-
ity to declare war. 
If you read the language of the reso-
lution, it continues to say that we are 
for, certainly, defending any of our 
people at risk, period. The War Powers 
Act provides for that. Article II of the 
Constitution provides for that. 
The President has ignored congres-
sional subpoenas for documents and 
testimony, directing subordinates to 
build a wall of obstruction unseen in 
our history. It should, therefore, be no 
surprise that we representatives of the 
320-plus million people of America, who 
expect us to be their voice in this crit-
ical issue of declaring war—and this 
resolution does not prohibit in any way 
the President of the United States, 
under his Article II powers, acting to 
defend our military, our allies, and our 
homeland. 
With the actions taken last week, the 
President is unilaterally moving us to-
ward involvement in another deadly 
and destabilizing war in the Middle 
East. 
I am glad, frankly, as we all are, that 
the response that came from Iran was 
either ineffective or simply meant to 
be a message. I don’t know which. 
Thankfully, however, the Congress 
has, under law and our Constitution, a 
remedy to reassert our position as a co-
equal branch—as a matter of fact, an 
Article I branch—and ensure, as the 
Founders intended, that only the Con-
gress, speaking on behalf of all the peo-
ple, could declare war. 
Congress passed the War Powers Act 
in 1973 because they believed a Demo-
cratic President, and it was a Demo-
cratic Congress that adopted the War 
Powers Act, because they believed a 
Democratic President had overstepped 
the bounds. 
Congress passed the War Powers Act 
in 1973, determined to ensure that no 
President can send our troops into war 
without the people’s representatives 
authorizing it. I suggest to my friends 
on both sides of the aisle that is what 
the Founders intended. 
We must use this tool of congres-
sional power or, by our silence, acqui-
esce to the growth of the imperial 
Presidency, which by the way, has been 
going on for some 40 years, maybe even 
50 years, irrespective of who is Presi-
dent. 
This is not a partisan resolution. 
This is a resolution consistent with the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America, which did not want a single 
person to be able to take America to 
war, to put our men and women at risk. 
Let us be absolutely clear: Qasem 
Soleimani was a dangerous purveyor of 
terror and violence and a practice 
thereof. He was an architect of Iranian 
efforts to dominate the Middle East 
through aggression and fear. He has 
American blood on his hands, as well as 
the blood of our allies. 
He has met the justice he deserves. I 
say that notwithstanding the fact I do 
not know from the information I have 
received whether or not, in fact, it was 
absolutely essential to take his life 
now because of imminent danger. Per-
haps it was. 
In any event, no one laments the loss 
of Soleimani’s life, at least in this 
country and by freedom-loving people 
throughout the world. We are relieved 
that the Iranian counterstrike was lim-
ited and caused no American or allied 
casualties. 
Mr. Speaker, my constituents and 
the American people are deeply con-
cerned about what comes next with a 
possibility of further retaliation and 
escalation from Iran or its proxies. 
There may be a time when such action 
is called for, but it is this body that 
needs to make that decision, the 
United States Senate and this body. 
Iran is a dangerous enemy of freedom 
and a sponsor of terror. It continues to 
harbor ambitions of dominance over its 
neighbors and to call for the destruc-
tion of Israel. This Iranian regime is no 
friend and must not be trusted. 
Iran must never be allowed to ac-
quire a nuclear weapon. I believe this 
Congress would vote to ensure that 
that was prohibited. This resolution 
makes those facts clear. We must have 
a sound, long-term strategy to deal 
with Iran and bring it into compliance 
with international laws and norms. 
The threat of military force must 
continue to be a part of any strategy, 
along with sanctions and diplomacy, 
and this resolution in no way con-
travenes that premise. 
The best way forward is for Congress 
and the administration to work to-
gether. That is what our Founders had 
in mind. Proper congressional over-
sight and involvement will help ensure, 
not undermine, that the administra-
tion adopts and pursues the best pos-
sible strategy to check and oppose 
Iran’s malign ambitions. 
Let us not demagogue one another. 
There can be differences. This resolu-
tion is brought to this floor of the 
House to uphold the Constitution of 
the United States of America and to 
again urge this President, as we have 
urged Democratic Presidents, to ensure 
that they follow the strictures of our 
Constitution on behalf of the safety of 
our people and the respect we have 
throughout the world. 
We are a nation of laws. This resolu-
tion is about the laws. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
great respect for the leader, and I do 
not disagree with him that the Presi-
dent needs to come to Congress to au-
thorize war with Iran, but that is not 
what we are looking at here today. 
We do not currently have troops en-
gaged in hostility in Iran subject to 
withdrawal under the War Powers Res-
olution. However, if the administration 
were to strike Iran directly, in my 
opinion, they would need to submit a 
war powers notification, and they 
would need to proceed with an author-
ized use of military force. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO). 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member MCCAUL for yielding. 
I oppose this resolution. The Speaker 
claims it is a necessary response to 
President Trump’s ‘‘disproportionate’’ 
attack on ‘‘high-level Iranian military 
officials.’’ Disproportionate? 
Apparently, Democrats have forgot-
ten who Qasem Soleimani was, one of 
the worst perpetrators of terror in re-
cent history. He led the organization 
that founded Hezbollah, one of the 
most violent terrorist groups opposing 
Israel. He directed his groups to kill 
over 600 American servicemembers in 
Iraq and wounded thousands more. He 
led 
a 
brutal 
attack 
on 
peaceful 
protestors recently in Iran, killing over 
1,000 Iranians. 
A bully will not stand down unless he 
knows you are willing to stand toe-to- 
toe with him, unless he knows there 
are consequences to his actions. Presi-
dent Trump acted decisively in bring-
ing down this brutal, inhumane bully, 
this terrorist mastermind, to stop an 
imminent threat. It was necessary to 
show Iran we will no longer tolerate 
their aggression. 
We should be united in our support 
for eliminating this threat and in sup-
porting the President’s efforts to nego-
tiate a new, more effective Iran deal. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
resolution so that all options are on 
the table and so that we can negotiate 
from a position of strength toward 
achieving a peaceful solution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO). 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this concurrent resolution, which re-
quires 
President 
Trump 
to 
imme-
diately terminate military operations 
against Iran. It is about time that Con-
gress exercised its war powers author-
ity under the Constitution. I believe 
this is long overdue. 
The President has taken our Nation 
to the brink of war without properly 
consulting Congress or seeking the 
legal authority to do so. Only Congress 
can authorize military action under 
Article I of the Constitution. 
To add insult to injury, the Trump 
administration has failed to fully ex-
plain to Congress and the American 
people what exactly the imminent 
threat was to the United States that 
required the strike that was under-
taken. My constituents and people

across the country have been terrified 
about the prospect of a new war in the 
Middle East. 
Now, let me be clear: No Member of 
Congress carries a brief for Soleimani 
or the Iranian Government. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. ESHOO). 
Ms. ESHOO. No President has unilat-
eral authority to take our Nation to 
war without authorization from Con-
gress. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
b 1645 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, if it were but a matter 
of offering three cheers for the legisla-
tive branch, that would be fine, but 
this is dangerous and simply makes no 
sense. 
If the majority wished to assert Con-
gress’ authority, as several have ar-
gued, it would not use a nonbinding 
resolution, but let me take the major-
ity at its chosen words, as if binding. 
The words of the resolution would 
literally prohibit the President from 
ordering the shoot-down of Iranian bal-
listic missiles inbound for Haifa or a 
surface-to-air missile locked onto a 
Ukrainian airliner. 
And the resolution’s chosen words, as 
Democrats argue them, would prevent 
the President from the strike on 
Soleimani itself even if devastating 
harm to American soldiers were immi-
nent but Democrats second-guessed 
that judgment. 
The language they have chosen is de-
signed to debilitate the President from 
protecting Americans. 
The intemperate words of the past 
week have cost many their credibility. 
Now Democrats’ spite for President 
Trump has cost them their good judg-
ment. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. DAVIS). 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I voted against the 2002 AUMF. In 
coming to that very difficult decision, 
I learned an important lesson: that we 
must ask every administration that 
seeks to use military force how it will 
manage the consequences of its ac-
tions, even if those actions can be jus-
tified. 
Has this administration done that? 
Unfortunately, I think the answer is 
no. 
I will vote for this resolution today 
for the same reasons I had then: no 
overall strategy, no justification, and 
nobody in this administration can an-
swer how it will respond to the after-
math. 
By virtue of the power and the re-
sponsibility granted to us by the Con-
stitution, we must ask those questions. 
Let’s take this opportunity to make 
diplomacy work. Let’s stand together 
as a Congress to establish our author-
ity. Let’s stand together and vote 
against a new war without an end 
game. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. ABRAHAM). 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, Ser-
geant First Class Kurt Comeaux, Ser-
geant 
Christopher 
Babin, 
Sergeant 
Bradley

James Lambert, Sergeant Taft Wil-
liams. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL, for giving me ad-
ditional time to finish the list that I 
started earlier. 
These are 44 young Americans from 
Louisiana who died by IEDs in the 
most 
active 
part 
of 
Iraq 
when 
Soleimani and his proxies were en-
gaged. They designed, they built, and 
they implemented these IEDs; and in 
Louisiana alone, 44 young Americans 
gave their lives for the United States 
of America. 
President Trump, he had the author-
ity, he has the right, and, thankfully, 
he had the courage to terminate 
Soleimani and remove this cancer from 
this Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, to my Democratic col-
leagues and friends, I say, if you can 
look these Gold Star families in the 
face and tell them that this was not a 
justified strike and that Soleimani 
needed to be removed from this Earth, 
then God have mercy on you. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI), a valued 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, we 
may be relieved that an impulsive act 
by President Trump has not imme-
diately led to war with Iran, we may be 
relieved that an evil man is dead, but 
as that evil man wished, our troops 
have now been asked to leave Iraq, and 
if they stay, their ability to work with 
Iraqis to fight ISIS has been shot. 
As he wished, the protest movement 
in Iran and Iraq that threatened the 
Iranian regime has been silenced. 
As he wished, Iran is now breaking 
free of all restrictions on its nuclear 
program. 
We are not safer today. 
In this moment of danger, there is 
just one question that this resolution 
asks. It is not do you support what the 
President has already done, but should 
Congress play our constitutional role 
in deciding what happens next. 
I support this resolution because 
passing it will protect us against going 
to war with a tweet, but it also ensures 
that, if we do go to war, which we may 
have to at some point, we will do so 
with the American people united, not 
divided, as the Framers intended, as 
our national interest demands. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in defense of our Constitution 
and express the urgent need of Con-
gress to reestablish itself as an equal 
branch of government. 
Our Founders explicitly laid out the 
roles and responsibilities of the legisla-
tive, executive, and judiciary branches, 
creating a necessary system of checks 
and balances, but today we find our 
democratic system in jeopardy. 
In the past week, there has been an 
increasing concern about the United 
States going to war with Iran. 
Let me be very clear: If and when the 
President decides to use military ac-
tion, he must go through Congress 
first. 
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitu-
tion gives Congress the power to de-
clare war. Any attempt to undermine 
that power would be unsafe, unaccept-
able, and unconstitutional. 
As a Navy veteran, I am constantly 
thinking of our brave servicemembers. 
It is why I take this constitutional re-
sponsibility seriously. 
We cannot turn our backs to our 
principles, we cannot turn our backs to 
our values, and we cannot turn our 
backs to the Constitution. 
I look forward to voting for the War 
Powers Resolution and taking Con-
gress’ power back. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in great frustration in opposi-
tion to this politically-motivated reso-
lution. It is nothing but a blatant at-
tempt to handcuff the President’s abil-
ity to defend our citizens and our al-
lies. 
Just this morning, U.S. intelligence 
officials reported that they are now 
confident that Ukraine Airlines 752 was 
shot down by Iranian surface-to-air 
missiles, another 176 innocent lives 
lost. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been 
hostile to our Nation for decades, and 
yet it has certainly escalated in the 
last several months with a campaign of 
antagonistic military action. 
Have my Democratic colleagues for-
gotten about the shipping vessel sabo-
taged by naval mines last May and 
June, or the American drone shot down 
over international waters, or the Brit-
ish oil tanker seized by the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard, or the Saudi oil 
facilities that were attacked? 
And then when an American citizen 
was killed in an attack on Kirkuk Air 
Base in December and our Embassy in 
Iraq subsequently overrun, our Presi-
dent drew a line in the sand. Yet, after 
months of tremendous restraint, the 
President was determined that not one

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H109 
January 9, 2020 
more American life would be lost by 
this hostile Iranian regime, and I fully 
support the President in his actions. 
I do agree with many of my col-
leagues that it is time for this body to 
have a serious conversation and to ad-
dress the many issues inherent with 
operating under a 20-plus-year-old au-
thorization for military force, but that 
should not be confused with the process 
that is taking place here with this res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
this is nothing but an attempt by the 
majority in a 3-year-long process by 
their party to take any and every op-
portunity to undermine or embarrass 
this President. But be assured that this 
politically-motivated 
resolution 
nor 
any evil that comes our way will cause 
our President to hesitate when called 
upon to defend American lives. 
I just say, God bless the President; 
God bless America. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would 
say to my friends on the other side of 
the aisle, please don’t question our mo-
tives or patriotism and we won’t ques-
tion yours. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this resolution that 
reasserts congressional authority over 
going to war. 
We know this: War is devastating for 
our troops, for their families, for fami-
lies and children everywhere, for not 
just this generation but future genera-
tions to come, for our humanity. That 
is why our Framers gave this body the 
opportunity, the responsibility to have 
that discussion and declare war should 
it be needed. 
In 2002, we rushed to war based on 
made-up claims of weapons of mass de-
struction, and the Iraq and Afghani-
stan wars took hundreds of thousands 
of lives, created millions of refugees, 
and cost us trillions of dollars. 
Today, the President, without pro-
viding any raw intelligence to prove an 
imminent threat, has brought us to the 
brink of war with Iran. This resolution 
makes it clear that Congress has not 
authorized this war. 
We also must repeal the 2002 AUMF 
and vote to withhold funds for this un-
authorized war. It is time to reassert 
our authority. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of #13DistrictStrong. This is 
a district that believes in leading with 
compassion. They believe in a full stop 
to endless violent wars that only result 
in loss of life and the destruction of 
lives forever changed. 
For us, Mr. Speaker, it is important 
to protect our democracy and promote 
global peace. We must remove political 
motives and for-profit schemes from 
the decisionmaking process to go to 
war. If we don’t, it would only lead to 
more warfare and death. 
We cannot allow a process that is 
tainted, secretive, or encompasses lies 
to make that choice. We need a coun-
try that easily chooses peace for gen-
erations to come. 
I proudly represent a district that be-
lieves in the rule of law. That is why I 
rise today as their voice in support of 
a War Powers Resolution that will give 
them a say in whether or not our coun-
try goes to war. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. GREEN). 
b 1700 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in complete opposition to this 
resolution. 
First, this is a nonbinding resolution. 
If you really wanted to exert some con-
gressional decisionmaking, we would 
do a bill that goes before the President 
and gets signed or gets vetoed. This is 
purely theatrics. 
None of these Democrat leaders stood 
up when President Obama violated the 
airspace of Pakistan to take out Osama 
bin Laden. Now, I am glad he did that, 
but there was no congressional author-
ization to go into Pakistan. At least 
here there is a congressional authoriza-
tion for our forces to be on the ground 
and using military power. 
The President has clear authority 
under Article II to act when our Nation 
and our military is at risk. The Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said: 
‘‘The trigger for the drone strike that 
killed Soleimani was ‘clear, unambig-
uous intelligence indicating a signifi-
cant campaign of violence against the 
United States in the days, weeks, and 
months,’ and that the administration 
would have been ‘culpably negligent’ if 
it didn’t act’’—General Mark Milley. 
These people understand one thing, 
and it is strength. You will recall that 
when President Clinton pulled our 
forces out of Somalia after we got the 
black eye on Black Hawk Down, bin 
Laden cited that as proof that Ameri-
cans run away, that they won’t stand 
and fight. 
I have been to combat three times in 
this region of the world, twice in Iraq 
and once in Afghanistan. I have looked 
these individuals in the eye. It is 
strength that they understand. And, 
clearly, it has shown itself to be true 
again. 
This President stood up, and Iran’s 
response was clear. They had two audi-
ences in their response: 
At home, they wanted people to see 
strength. They shot 15 missiles. Back 
in their press, they are saying they 
killed 
Americans. 
They 
didn’t, 
of 
course. 
The 
other 
audience, 
the 
United 
States and the rest of the world, they 
fired 16 missiles, all 16 missed. All 16 
missiles missed. 
Remember when they hit Saudi Ara-
bia? All those missiles hit. They know 
how to hit their target. They fired 16 
missiles against us and not one hit. 
What is the message they are saying? 
Immediately after they fired them, 
they stood up and said: We are done. 
No more. That is the end of our re-
sponse. They told the Shia militia 
groups to stand down. Muqtada al-Sadr 
said to his people today: Stand down. 
They respond to strength, and our 
President did the right thing. He was a 
strong response, a strong response to 
storming a sovereign U.S. territory of 
an embassy with 6,000 people, killing 
American contractors, and wounding 
American soldiers with a rocket at-
tack. 
Mr. Speaker, this President made a 
strong response, and it has shown itself 
to work. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I just can’t 
really believe what I just heard. 
It was the 2001 AUMF that specifi-
cally authorized our going after Osama 
bin Laden. He is the example of Con-
gress getting involved. That was the 
authorization to get Osama bin Laden 
in Pakistan or anyplace else, and that 
is what we are trying to assure here, 
that things aren’t just happening, that 
there is actual authority. Osama bin 
Laden is the wrong example, because 
we gave the authority to go after him. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
FRANKEL). 
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, as the 
mother of a United States Marine war 
veteran, I came to Congress with the 
promise of never sending someone 
else’s child to a war that could be 
avoided. This War Powers Resolution 
says no war with Iran without congres-
sional approval, while still ensuring de-
fense if there is an imminent threat. 
While we do not mourn the death of 
Iran’s commander of terror, Americans 
and our allies worry about the rami-
fications that will make us less safe: 
the fight against ISIS has been di-
verted; regional protests against the 
Iranian regime are now against Amer-
ica; Iranian proxies have been further 
incited; and Iran is closer to having a 
nuclear weapon. 
America is not a monarchy. The deci-
sion to go to war requires debate, delib-
eration, and collective judgment. That 
is why the law gives the responsibility 
to Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, at this 
point, I will continue to reserve until 
Chairman ENGEL is prepared to close. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Mr. ENGEL, for yielding. 
I am troubled by aspects of this de-
bate. I think it is fine that we have dif-
ferent views, but to hear some on the 
other side characterize the position of

January 9, 2020 
those who support this resolution as 
somehow not loving the country as 
much as they do when it is our coun-
try, as well, that we have pledged to 
defend—it is the same veterans on this 
side of the aisle who put themselves in 
harm’s way as the veterans on the 
other side of the aisle. There is no dis-
tinction in the battlefield. We love our 
children and want to defend them as 
much as we know you do as well. So 
let’s stop the demagoguery regarding 
patriotism. 
This comes to a simple question. It is 
not even a question as to whether or 
not there was justification to take out 
Mr. Soleimani, because clearly there 
was. The question is: Who gives the 
justification? Who authorizes military 
action in this country? 
We can all have our opinions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Michigan an addi-
tional 15 seconds. 
Mr. KILDEE. We ought to consult the 
Constitution, which clearly vests that 
authority in this Congress. We ought 
not fear that authority and outsource 
it to the executive branch. We ought to 
embrace that authority and be willing 
to make that decision and follow the 
Constitution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding. Congress 
has long been absent without leave 
from its constitutional responsibility 
to authorize war before it occurs. From 
Vietnam to Iran, the verdict on the 
War Powers Act is clear: you lose it if 
you do not use it. 
Congress chafes at outsized Presi-
dential power, but has failed to exer-
cise its own advice and consent power 
on war. Iran has stepped back for now 
from the brink of war, following the 
killing of General Soleimani, but a 
strong bipartisan 69 percent of the 
American people say that war with 
Iran is now more likely. No wonder, 
considering we just deployed 15,000 
more troops to the region. 
Trying to get answers after the fact, 
as Congress did in yesterday’s briefing, 
yielded frustration, not answers. Un-
checked executive power unbalances 
the safeguards against arbitrary power 
the Framers built into our Constitu-
tion. 
With passage of today’s resolution, 
we will reclaim that balance by re-
inserting Congress into decisions to go 
to war. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH), a very valued member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on the 
Middle East, North Africa, and Inter-
national Terrorism. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this War Powers Resolution, 
and I thank my colleague from Michi-
gan, Representative SLOTKIN, for lead-
ing this effort today to assert Con-
gress’ rightful authority and to defend 
our solemn constitutional duty. 
None of us want to see our brave men 
and women sent into another war. 
To be clear, this vote is not about 
telling the administration that the 
President can’t defend this country. 
My colleagues know that. They under-
stand it. I strongly reject any implica-
tion that somehow, by supporting this 
resolution, we don’t take our national 
security and the safety of our service-
members seriously. 
To the contrary, nothing we do today 
limits the ability to respond to a real 
and imminent threat or defend this 
country and our interests. To assert so 
is simply false and it is reckless. 
Today, we are telling the President 
that, if there is a serious threat to the 
United States, our national security 
requires that a solemn decision is made 
to engage U.S. Forces, and the elected 
representatives of this body, of the 
American people, need to have that 
case made to them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an-
other 15 seconds to the gentleman from 
Florida. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, Congress 
needs to have a robust debate about 
any authorization for the use of mili-
tary force. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I 
urge my colleagues to uphold the Con-
stitution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I take a 
backseat to no Member of this body 
when it comes to defending the Presi-
dent. 
This resolution offers no criticism of 
the President, no critique. It doesn’t 
criticize the President’s attack on 
Soleimani. As a matter fact, this reso-
lution doesn’t even say Soleimani’s 
name in it. Yet it does articulate our 
very robust basis for self-defense, at 
times even preemptory self-defense to 
defend our troops. And it also articu-
lates our nondelegable duty as the 
Members of the United States Congress 
to speak to matters of war and peace. 
I represent more troops than any 
other Member of this body. I buried one 
of them earlier today at Arlington, and 
that sergeant died a patriot and a hero. 
If the members of our armed services 
have the courage to go and fight and 
die in these wars, as Congress, we 
ought to have the courage to vote for 
them or against them. And I think it is 
ludicrous to suggest that we are im-
pairing the troops from doing their job 
by not doing our job articulated in the 
Constitution to speak to these matters 
of war and peace. 
I 
support 
the 
President. 
Killing 
Soleimani was the right decision, but 
engaging in another forever war in the 
Middle East would be the wrong deci-
sion, and that is why I am voting for 
this resolution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MOULTON). 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, the sys-
tem of checks and balances is broken. 
Last week’s airstrike proves it. 
After the strike, the administration 
produced a vague document that at-
tempts justifying America’s push to 
the brink of war. 
Mr. Speaker, I fought in a war start-
ed by a President with false and 
trumped-up intelligence. We cannot let 
this President do the same. 
Americans deserve to read the declas-
sified report so they can judge for 
themselves whether the strike was 
worth the risk. They will find an ad-
ministration shooting from the hip 
with no strategy to deal with Iran. 
It is time for Congress to lead and ex-
ercise the authority the Founders gave 
us in Article I, Section 8 of the Con-
stitution. 
It is time to tell the President he 
cannot send our troops to war with 
Iran without a strategy and without 
the consent of their representatives. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, 
President 
Trump’s 
strategy 
to 
counter Iran has failed. He has allowed 
Iran to restart its nuclear weapons pro-
gram, disrupted our operations coun-
tering ISIS, continues to undermine 
our relationship with NATO allies, and 
has led America to the brink of a new 
and unnecessary war. 
As someone who served in Iraq, I un-
derstand the costs of war, how our sol-
diers put their lives on the line, and 
the impact these decisions have on 
military families. 
Our Founders entrusted Congress 
with the responsibility to declare war. 
Congress owes it to the American peo-
ple and our men and women in uniform 
to carry out that responsibility. 
It is time for Congress to declare 
that war with Iran is not in the best in-
terest of the American people. It is 
time for Congress to repeal the 2002 
AUMF and dramatically restrict the 
2001 AUMF. And until we can do that, 
we must prevent the President from 
unilaterally committing the United 
States to another war in the Middle 
East. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I was sitting in my office 
watching this debate, and I began to 
wonder who it is that we are actually 
debating against or what it is that we 
are debating against. 
I think back to the killing of Osama 
bin Laden when we stood together as 
the United States in saying this was 
the right thing to do at the right time 
because it would save lives; the only 
thing we regretted was that we didn’t 
do it sooner when we had the chance to 
take him out, but we delayed because 
we weren’t sure.

H111 
January 9, 2020 
b 1715 
I have gone back and read what 
President Obama said and he said, ‘‘I 
made this decision on my own.’’ Yet, 
today, we stand in the people’s House, 
and we are worried more about the loss 
of an election in 2020 than the loss of 
American lives and the continued loss 
of lives around the world by one of the 
worst terrorists of all time. 
We sit here and try to pretend this 
charade is what we are concerned 
about. But what we are really con-
cerned about is giving too much power 
to this President. This is a President 
who acted boldly. This is a President 
who carried out a strike that was so 
precise, so strategic, nothing else was 
hurt except the car in which that ter-
rorist was riding in. 
Yet, we sit here today and say: Our 
problem in America isn’t terrorists 
around the world. Our problem in 
America is that we have a President 
who is too damn strong. The rest of the 
world knows today that our enemies 
certainly do fear us, because they know 
there is a deterrent in the White 
House. 
Our friends and allies know that 
America will always be there, will al-
ways be there if we say we are going to 
be there, and we will always stand up 
for the values that this country has al-
ways stood for. 
To have this debate tonight and this 
resolution is not about securing Amer-
ica or making America safer. This is 
about taking powers away from the 
President of the United States. We can 
call this anything we want and say, not 
just this President but any President 
in the future. 
My God, are you kidding me? Are you 
kidding me? This is the people’s House 
and our biggest responsibility is pro-
tecting our American citizens, and we 
are having this debate tonight? Please, 
do not tell me this is about taking 
away the Authorization for the Use of 
Military Force. This is about taking 
away powers from the President. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
think it would be helpful if peoples’ 
motives or patriotism wasn’t ques-
tioned. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI-
DER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the War 
Powers Resolution introduced by my 
colleague from Michigan, Congress-
woman ELISSA SLOTKIN. 
Soleimani was an evil man, a ter-
rorist, a war criminal. No one should 
mourn his demise. But that doesn’t 
change the question of who has the au-
thority to take our Nation into war. It 
is Congress and only Congress that is 
endowed with the most solemn duty to 
decide if, when, and where to commit 
our Nation to war. 
At the same time, as Commander in 
Chief, it is incumbent upon our Presi-
dent to ensure that the fine men and 
women who serve in our military are 
only sent into harm’s way after careful 
deliberation and tasked with missions 
that protect and further America’s in-
terests and reflect the values and high 
moral standing of our Nation. 
Our country’s Founders in their fore-
sight provided us a robust and con-
stitutional Republic and representative 
government. They wisely understood 
that taking a nation to war should not 
be a unilateral decision by a single per-
son, but a considered decision by the 
people’s elected Representatives. 
This administration does not have 
congressional authorization for use of 
military force or a declaration of war 
against Iran. Ultimately, any sustained 
action against Iran requires congres-
sional approval. 
Today’s resolution reflects the inten-
tions of our Founders. It makes clear 
the President must seek authorization 
from Congress for any extended mili-
tary engagement with Iran without re-
stricting his ability to protect the Na-
tion from imminent threat. 
I have the honor of representing 
Naval Station Great Lakes where every 
enlisted sailor receives his or her basic 
training. I am the proud father of a son 
serving in our Navy. We owe it to these 
Americans, each one a volunteer an-
swering the call to serve our country, 
to protect this Constitution and live up 
to the expectations of our Founders. 
The American people do not want an 
unnecessary war with Iran. Today’s 
resolution prevents President Trump 
from unilaterally or impulsively start-
ing one. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA-
GHER), a man who served on the battle-
field in Iraq. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, ac-
tually, it takes a lot to get me to come 
down to these things, but I have been 
deeply troubled by some of the rhetoric 
I have been hearing about this. In fact, 
I was deeply troubled after yesterday 
when my colleagues, many of them, 
left a classified briefing only to imme-
diately and recklessly trash the qual-
ity of intelligence they received, and in 
some cases, suggest there was no immi-
nent threat from Soleimani. 
To suggest that would require you to 
ignore the death of Americans recently 
in Iraq, as well as ignore the history of 
Soleimani’s campaign of terror across 
the Middle East. 
We learned this weekend, while this 
body was still in recess and before any-
one had reviewed any of the classified 
information, that it was the intention 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle to introduce this flawed War 
Powers 
Resolution 
without 
having 
even seen any of the underlying intel-
ligence. That suggests that this is not 
a serious effort. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BROWN of Maryland). The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Wisconsin an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, this 
is not a serious effort. This is a polit-
ical effort that will have the practical 
effect only of undermining our mili-
tary deterrent in the Middle East, 
which for the first time in a long time 
is actually stronger. 
I think this does a service not only to 
our personnel in the region, but ulti-
mately to the Iranian people. And what 
the Iranian regime fears more than 
anything else, more than the American 
military and the President of the 
United States, is its own people. And 
that is the reason Soleimani’s death 
squads have gunned down Iranian civil-
ians in the streets. 
We look forward to the day when the 
Iranian people can be free of their evil, 
barbarous, reckless regime, and I ap-
plaud the administration’s actions. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, our Found-
ers vested in Congress the solemn re-
sponsibility of sending our sons and 
daughters to war. 
I have often heard folks say that now 
is not the time to discuss the use of 
force or the decision to send our men 
and women to fight. I heard that in 2003 
when I was carrying a rifle in Baghdad. 
I heard it again in 2004 and 2005 when I 
was leading my unit through the 
mountains of Afghanistan, and I am 
hearing it again today in the Halls of 
Congress. 
In the last 19 years, more than 7,000 
Americans have given their lives in 
these conflicts; 53,000 have been wound-
ed; and we have spent over $4 trillion of 
taxpayer money. Do not believe the 
fearmongering. 
This resolution does nothing to pre-
vent the President from protecting the 
Nation against imminent threats. I 
have spent years fighting to keep 
Americans safe and will continue to do 
so. 
I may have laid down my rifle, but 
my oath to this country endures. I will 
fight to ensure that we are having a 
discussion about when to send our men 
and women, our sons and daughters, 
and our sisters and brothers into 
harm’s way. It is time to have this de-
bate. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, at this 
point I continue to reserve the balance 
of my time until the chairman is pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to condemn the President’s most 
recent reckless actions. The killing of 
General Soleimani was a provocation 
to war that made Americans less safe 
for years and maybe decades to come. 
The President has put his own ego 
over the strategic interests and safety

of Americans. What he has accom-
plished with these actions is to make 
Soleimani a martyr for a generation of 
militant Middle Eastern foes that we 
have. 
It has united the Iranian people, not 
against their government, but against 
us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Tennessee an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, it is the re-
sponsibility of the President and Con-
gress to keep us safe, and the Founding 
Fathers knew that the collective wis-
dom of the people’s Representatives 
was better at doing that than one per-
son. 
I just visited the SCIF and there is 
still not any report on any imminent 
danger claim that might have been 
made. The American people and Con-
gress deserve to know what the threat 
allegedly was, given the inevitability 
of Iranian retaliation. 
The two greatest powers Congress 
has are impeachment and declarations 
of war. We are here today on both of 
those issues because of a reckless, law-
less, and impetuous President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS), a very distinguished 
gentleman on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent should not be able to commit the 
U.S. recklessly and flagrantly to war. 
That is the reason there are constitu-
tionally mandated checks and bal-
ances. The President escalated hos-
tilities with Iran and did not dem-
onstrate any imminent threat nor 
strategy as to why. 
He clearly did not make our country 
safer. Quite the opposite. It is not a 
sign of strength as some of my col-
leagues suggest. It was an unchecked 
sign of more disarray and lack of stra-
tegic thinking. 
We have seen what happens when we 
don’t have a plan for what comes next 
when we take out a bad actor without 
thinking 
through 
long-term 
con-
sequences. 
We have lost too much blood and 
tears and treasure to ever allow that to 
happen again. I support, and implore 
my colleagues to support, this resolu-
tion for the sake and the state of fu-
ture generations. I love this country. 
This is the greatest country in the 
world because we have checks and bal-
ances. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I have just 
got a couple of words I would like to 
remind this body about. I have heard a 
lot of talk about patriotism, and I gave 
this arm in Vietnam. 
I have got a lot of good friends whose 
names are on the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial Wall, so don’t talk to me 
about patriotism, and how much I love 
this country when we are standing here 
debating an issue that we all know is 
not going anywhere. 
The last thing I would say to you is, 
while I was serving in Vietnam, there 
were many occasions when I didn’t 
have the ability to do what I thought 
was necessary. I just say to you that 
this body couldn’t make up their mind 
whether they wanted to be in that war 
or not, and I suggest we get with the 
right program and do it now. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am strongly in favor 
of exercising our Article I authorities 
for matters as grave as war and peace, 
but the fact is, we are not at war with 
Iran. The President is not trying to 
start a war with Iran. 
I met with the President earlier 
today. He told me that if this resolu-
tion passes, it will take all of his power 
to negotiate with Iran off the table. 
That is the worst thing that we could 
do. 
Yesterday, he called for making a 
deal that allows for Iran to thrive and 
prosper. The President is making the 
choice to move toward deescalation. 
The premise of this resolution is 
flawed because we are not engaged in 
hostilities with Iran. The President is 
not trying to start hostilities with 
Iran. Despite this public proclamation 
by our President, my colleagues are 
trying to claim that the President still 
wants to go to war. 
I deeply regret that my colleagues 
are not serious enough about exer-
cising our Article I authorities to pur-
sue regular order on such a serious 
question. We have had no hearings in 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
since these events transpired. There 
was no Foreign Affairs Committee 
markup of this legislation. 
I received the text of this legislation 
only 2 hours before the Rules Com-
mittee meeting last night on a War 
Powers Resolution. Debating issues of 
war and peace is perhaps our most im-
portant responsibility as Members of 
Congress, and, yet, this legislation 
dropped last night without committee 
consideration as required by the War 
Powers Resolution. 
b 1730 
If my colleagues were as serious 
about Article I as they say they are, 
then this would be a joint resolution 
with the force of law. Instead, it is a 
House concurrent resolution that will 
never go to the President’s desk. Let 
me translate what that means to the 
American people listening today. 
Today, we are voting on a press re-
lease, a press statement. This is a po-
litical statement for a leftwing domes-
tic audience. But they are not the only 
ones watching, Mr. Speaker. 
Iran is watching, and its proxies are 
watching. What they see is a divided 
America that does not fully support 
the ability of our Commander in Chief 
to respond to imminent threats to 
Americans. 
Churchill warned against appease-
ment when the dark clouds of fascism 
and the Third Reich swept in, in my fa-
ther’s war. Weakness invites aggres-
sion, he said. President Reagan said: 
‘‘Peace through strength.’’ I believe in 
these ideals and these axioms. 
Last May, it was reported that 
Soleimani met with Iraqi militias in 
Baghdad and told them to ‘‘prepare for 
proxy war.’’ 
Without 
last 
week’s 
strike, 
Soleimani would still be waging that 
proxy war, a war that he was esca-
lating. An American was killed less 
than 2 weeks ago, and four American 
soldiers were injured. Our Embassy in 
Baghdad 
was 
attacked 
under 
Soleimani’s orders. 
What more do we need? What more 
evidence do we need? 
Let’s talk about the facts. He is a 
designated terrorist under the Obama 
administration. 
Importantly, 
the 
President 
told 
me 
today 
that 
Soleimani was planning to blow up our 
Embassy. I need no further proof, evi-
dence, or intelligence than that from 
the President of the United States. 
What if the President had not acted? 
Let’s assume that. By the way, some 
on the other side of the aisle were criti-
cizing him for not responding after our 
Embassy was attacked. 
What if he did not act. What if 
Soleimani had made it back to Tehran 
to meet with the Ayatollah to give the 
green light to carry out the plot to at-
tack our soldiers and diplomats in 
Iraq? What if the Americans were 
killed? What if they killed our soldiers 
and diplomats? What if they success-
fully stormed our American Embassy 
and held our marines and diplomats 
hostage, like they did in 1979 when this 
whole reign of terror started with 
Jimmy Carter in the White House? 
How would the critics of the Presi-
dent respond then if we had done noth-
ing? How would the American people 
respond? How would the Gold Star 
Mothers respond? 
No, this President did the right thing 
to take out this threat that killed so 
many Americans. I have been to too 
many funerals, as many of us in this 
Chamber have, and many of those sol-
diers were killed at the bloody hands of 
Soleimani. As many Americans whose 
families still grieve today, we grieve 
for them. 
Since 1979, Iran has presided over a 
reign of terror in the region. For over 
two decades, Soleimani has been the 
mastermind of terror, and the world is 
safer today without him. 
Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by say-
ing that now is not the time to divide 
this Nation and play into the propa-
ganda of Iran. Now is not the time to 
tie our Commander in Chief’s hands. 
Now is the time to support our men 
and women in uniform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H113 
January 9, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this resolution, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the remainder of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, this body has to make a 
decision about whether we are going to 
stand up for our constitutional respon-
sibilities or just subordinate ourselves 
to the executive branch when it comes 
to war powers. 
We are two decades into the 21st cen-
tury. Our country has been at war al-
most that entire time. Not a day goes 
by that I don’t wish we could have 
some of those decisions back, espe-
cially because we see that those meas-
ures we passed in 2001 and 2002 are still 
being used to justify sending American 
men and women into harm’s way. 
We could stand here all day and say 
your side let this happen when you 
were in charge, or you didn’t say any-
thing when this President did that. I 
don’t disagree that it has been a collec-
tive failure on the part of this body 
that we have given away our authority 
on war powers and that we haven’t 
done enough to grapple with the issue. 
I hope today will not be the end of 
our efforts to make progress on debat-
ing Congress’ war powers. If the Presi-
dent thinks he needs to use military 
force, then he needs to come to Con-
gress and make the case and let us vote 
on it. This is the beginning of Con-
gress’ taking back its authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Truth matters, Mr. Speaker. 
Truth matters. 
Truth is not Democratic or Republican. Truth 
is not partisan. It is the basis of any society 
that hopes to be and hopes to remain civ-
ilized. And so, when a faction decides that 
facts are flexible, that facts are whatever vali-
dates their preconceived notions and not what 
is, then that nation may as well close shop 
and turn out the lights. 
The Trump administration’s justification for 
military action against Iran has been incon-
sistent at best. Donald Trump’s speech on 
January 8, 2020 was a pathetic spectacle. 
And the Congressional briefing was a sham, a 
cavalcade of falsehoods that has been de-
nounced by Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Any rational observer, any fair-minded per-
son can see it. Certainly, my Republican col-
leagues know. Which is why some have 
turned to audacious, outrageous statements. I 
have heard them say that dissenting voices 
support terrorism simply for asking questions. 
That those of us who want to avoid war are 
traitors. 
They have gone so far and have gone so 
low to blame President Obama for Iran’s re-
cent attack on U.S. forces. Going so far as to 
lie that Iran was given over $150 billion after 
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was 
signed. 
These are scurrilous lies. Let me repeat 
that: these accusations are lies, told by des-
perate people. Told by people too cowardly to 
put their ambitions aside to lift a finger for 
truth. I’d say they should be ashamed of them-
selves, but they are clearly past shame. That 
ship has sailed. 
In his opus, George Orwell observed that 
‘‘The party told you to reject the evidence of 
your eyes and ears. It was their final, most es-
sential command.’’ That’s an exact blueprint 
for these lies. Those propagating these lies 
may be at war with truth, but I’m not. I still be-
lieve in truth and in fact. 
Here is the truth and the fact. The ham- 
fisted decisions of the Trump administration 
will not prevent Iran from getting nuclear 
weapons, but could hasten that outcome. 
Here is the truth. War with Iran will not ben-
efit us. War endangers our troops, leads to 
death and misery, and harms our allies. 
Here is the fact. Americans do not want an-
other damn war. 
War powers belong to Congress, not the 
President, and it is our job here to defend our 
constitutional prerogative. And we did this by 
passing a war powers resolution. 
I believe in truth. I do not believe in unnec-
essary war. And I stand with this House that 
today made a big statement for both. To cor-
rect the record of lies, I include in the RECORD 
this New York Times article ‘‘References in 
Address to 2013 Deal Had Holes’’ by Linda 
Qiu from January 9, 2020. 
[From The New York Times, Jan. 8, 2020] 
FACT CHECK—TRUMP’S INACCURATE 
STATEMENTS ABOUT THE CONFLICT WITH IRAN 
(By Linda Qiu) 
President Trump, responding during a 
White House address on Wednesday to the 
missile strikes by Iran, assailed the nuclear 
agreement reached by his predecessor and 
praised American military might. The 10- 
minute address contained numerous inac-
curacies and claims that lacked evidence. 
Here’s a fact check. 
What Mr. Trump said: 
‘‘Iran’s hostilities substantially increased 
after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed 
in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not 
to mention $1.8 billion in cash.’’ 
This is misleading. The agreement reached 
by Iran, the United States and a number of 
other nations to constrain Tehran’s nuclear 
program did not directly provide American 
money to Iran, but it did release about $100 
billion in previously frozen Iranian assets. 
Much of the amount was tied up by debt obli-
gations, for example, $20 billion to China for 
financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the 
actual amount available to Iran range from 
$35 billion to $65 billion. 
A separate $1.7 billion transfer of cash to 
Iran was to settle a decades-long dispute and 
was agreed to in negotiations that happened 
parallel to the nuclear deal. Before the 1979 
revolution, Iran’s shah had paid $400 million 
for American military goods but, after he 
was overthrown, the equipment was never 
delivered. The clerics who seized control de-
manded the money back, but the United 
States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is 
interest accumulated over 35 years. 
Iran and other parties to the nuclear ac-
cord signed an interim agreement in 2013, 
but the formal agreement was not reached 
until 2015. The White House did not respond 
when asked for evidence of increased Iranian 
‘‘hostilities.’’ 
It is worth noting that before Mr. Trump 
withdrew the United States from the nuclear 
agreement in 2018, his administration repeat-
edly certified that Iran was in compliance. 
Afterward, as his so-called maximum-pres-
sure campaign on Iran continued, tensions 
between the United States and Iran ‘‘esca-
lated significantly,’’ according to a recent 
Congressional Research Service report. Mr. 
Trump’s claim blaming the nuclear accord 
for Iranian aggression rather than his with-
drawal from it is ‘‘almost an inverted re-
ality,’’ said Jim Walsh, a research associate 
at M.I.T.’s Security Studies Program and an 
expert on nuclear issues and the Middle East. 
He said that attacks by the four groups 
supported by Iran and designated by some 
governments as terrorist organizations— 
Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad 
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command—actually de-
clined after the nuclear deal. 
Attacks carried out by these groups de-
creased from more than 80 in 2014 to six in 
2017, before increasing to more than 40 in 
2018, according to the Global Terrorism 
Database maintained by the University of 
Maryland’s National Consortium for the 
Study of Terrorism and Responses to Ter-
rorism. And while Iran has been a violent 
and destabilizing force across the region, Mr. 
Trump’s assertion that Tehran had ‘‘created 
hell’’ lacked context in some cases. 
Iranian aid to President Bashar al-Assad of 
Syria in that country’s civil war and 
Tehran’s backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen 
both predate the signing of the nuclear 
agreement, formally known as the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
‘‘There’s nothing that Iran was doing after 
J.C.P.O.A. that it wasn’t doing before,’’ said 
Vali R. Nasr, a professor of Middle East stud-
ies at Johns Hopkins University and a State 
Department official in the Obama adminis-
tration. 
Calling Iran’s backing of the Houthi rebels 
against the Saudi Arabia-aligned govern-
ment in Yemen terrorism is ‘‘devaluing the 
word to the point where it’s meaningless,’’ 
said Anthony Cordesman, an expert on mili-
tary affairs and the Middle East at the Cen-
ter for Strategic and International Studies. 
As for Iran’s activities in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, Mr. Cordesman said, ‘‘they were more 
aggressive there because they were working 
to attack ISIS—as we were.’’ 
What Mr. Trump said: 
‘‘The missiles fired last night at us and our 
allies were paid for with the funds made 
available by the last administration.’’ 
This lacks evidence. The White House did 
not respond when asked to substantiate this 
claim, and experts noted there was no proof 
that Iranian assets unfrozen by the deal paid 
for the missiles. 
‘‘There’s a certain fungibility here,’’ Mr. 
Walsh said. If the Iranian foreign minister, 
Mohammad Javad Zarif, ‘‘took a dollar on 
the street, did that fund the missile attack?’’ 
he added. ‘‘That’s not very useful from an 
analytical perspective. Nor is the case that 
giving them money caused them to attack 
the U.S.’’ 
’’We have no indication,’’ Mr. Cordesman 
said, ‘‘whether these missiles are funded by 
the money from the J.C.P.O.A.’’ 
The director of national intelligence’s an-
nual report on worldwide threats in 2019 did 
note that Iran continued to develop and im-
prove military capabilities including bal-
listic missiles, but it did not tie those efforts 
to the nuclear deal. Furthermore, the annual 
reports warned of the same efforts in 2015, 
2014, 2013, 2012 and before. 
Critics of the Iran deal, including Mr. 
Trump, have long argued that it was inad-
equate because it did not address Iran’s abil-
ity to develop ballistic missiles. Those re-
strictions have instead been established by 
the United Nations Security Council resolu-
tions. 
The diplomatic accord was an arms deal 
with a very narrow aim of curbing Iran’s nu-
clear ambitions, ‘‘not a nonaggression pact, 
not a form of a friendship treaty,’’ Mr. Nasr 
of Johns Hopkins said. ‘‘Whether there could 
have been more in the deal, of course. But 
piling in expectations is disingenuous.’’

H114 
January 9, 2020 
What Mr. Trump said: 
‘‘The very defective J.C.P.O.A. expires 
shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and 
quick path to nuclear breakout.’’ 
This is exaggerated. The major provisions 
limiting Iran’s nuclear capabilities last a 
decade or longer. And the agreement in-
creased the ‘‘breakout’’ period—the time it 
would take Iran to produce enough fuel for 
one weapon—to at least a year from an esti-
mated two to three months. If the deal had 
been left in place and fully adhered to, Iran 
would not have been able to achieve nuclear 
breakout until 2030. 
The agreement also prohibits Iran from 
pursuing 
nuclear 
weapons 
permanently. 
‘‘Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances 
will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any 
nuclear weapons,’’ the first paragraph of the 
deal reads. 
The American Israel Public Affairs Com-
mittee, a vocal critic of the deal, said it 
‘‘largely expires after only 15 years.’’ Under 
the deal’s terms, Iran agreed not to use more 
than 5,060 centrifuges to enrich uranium— 
and not to pursue research and development 
on centrifuges—for 10 years. Limits on en-
richment levels, facilities and stockpiles last 
for 15 years, according to a report from the 
Congressional Research Service. 
Under the terms of the accord, Iran also 
agreed to convert a deep underground enrich-
ment facility into a ‘‘technology center’’ 
that cannot contain nuclear material and 
where the number of centrifuges is limited 
for 15 years. Several provisions on pluto-
nium, including forbidding the construction 
of new heavy water reactors, last for 15 
years. 
Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and 
related infrastructure for 15 years, verify in-
ventory for 20 years and monitor uranium 
mines for 25 years. 
What Mr. Trump said: 
‘‘We are now the No. 1 producer of oil and 
natural gas anywhere in the world. We are 
independent, and we do not need Middle East 
oil.’’ 
This is misleading. The United States has 
been the largest producer of oil and gas in 
the world since 2013, a trend that began 
under the Obama administration thanks in 
large part to advances in shale drilling tech-
niques. 
The Energy Information Administration 
projected in January 2019 that the United 
States will produce more energy than it im-
ports this year, the first time since 1950. But 
that is not the same thing as not importing 
oil from the Middle East at all. In 2018, the 
United States imported more than 1.5 mil-
lion barrels a day from the Persian Gulf. 
What was said: 
‘‘The American military has been com-
pletely rebuilt under my administration at a 
cost of $2.5 trillion.’’ 
This is exaggerated. The $2.5 trillion figure 
refers to the total defense budgets of the 
past four fiscal years: $606 billion the 2017 fis-
cal year (which began before Mr. Trump took 
office), $671 billion in 2018, $685 billion in 2019 
and $718 billion in 2020. But the amount spent 
on 
procurement—buying 
and 
upgrading 
equipment—was about $562 billion over that 
period. 
Mr. Trump’s use of the phrase ‘‘completely 
rebuilt’’ is somewhat subjective. Though the 
Trump administration has invested in oper-
ational readiness over the past few years, 
there are signs that the military continues 
to face substantial challenges in addressing 
an array of threats from around the world. 
For example, the military earned a mid-
dling grade of ‘‘marginal’’ from the conserv-
ative Heritage Foundation’s annual index of 
strength, based on factors like shortages in 
personnel and aging equipment. The think 
tank noted that American forces are prob-
ably capable of meeting the demands of a 
single major regional conflict but ‘‘would be 
very hard-pressed to do more and certainly 
would be ill-equipped to handle two nearly 
simultaneous major regional contingencies.’’ 
What was said: 
‘‘Three months ago, after destroying 100 
percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, 
we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al- 
Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much 
death.’’ 
This is exaggerated. The Islamic State lost 
its final territories in March 2019, ending the 
physical ‘‘caliphate,’’ but the terrorist group 
has not been destroyed. The recent con-
frontation with Iran has halted the United 
States’ campaign against ISIS. Just this 
week, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and 
Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the fight 
against the group was continuing. 
Mr. Trump alluded to the organization’s 
endurance in his speech when he said: ‘‘ISIS 
is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction 
of ISIS is good for Iran. And we should work 
together on this and other shared prior-
ities.’’ 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, ac-
cording to ABC News, General Mark Milley, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said that the 
‘‘Dec. 27 attack on the Iraqi base near Kirkuk 
that killed a U.S. civilian contractor and 
wounded several U.S. and Iraqi forces . . . 
was designed and intended to kill, and 
[Soleimani] approved it. I know that 100 per-
cent.’’ 
General Milley said that the trigger for the 
drone strike that killed Soleimani was ‘‘clear, 
unambiguous intelligence indicating a signifi-
cant campaign of violence against the United 
States in the days, weeks, and months,’’ and 
that the administration would have been ‘‘cul-
pably negligent’’ if it didn’t act. 
Former Obama Homeland Security Sec-
retary Jeh Johnson said on NBC’s Meet the 
Press that ‘‘whether Soleimani was a terrorist 
or a general in a military force that was en-
gaged in armed attacks against our people, he 
was a lawful military objective.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Soleimani is responsible for 
killing over 600 Americans and disabling thou-
sands more. He is directly responsible for 
massive death and injury of innocent civilians 
in the region. In the last two months alone, he 
orchestrated 11 attacks on U.S. troops in 
Iraq—killing 
an 
American 
contractor 
and 
wounding four soldiers—and for the attack on 
our embassy in Baghdad. 
After yesterday’s classified briefing by Amer-
ica’s top diplomatic, military and intelligence 
leaders, I came away convinced that the ac-
tion by President Trump was justified, propor-
tionate and above all necessary to protect 
American lives. 
That said, it is astonishing that the resolu-
tion under consideration by the House today 
has absolutely no legal power, is non-bind-
ing—and by design can neither be signed nor 
vetoed by the President. 
Remarkably, the text of H. Con. Res. 83 
also sends a mixed message. While pur-
porting to ‘‘terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or 
against Iran. . . .’’ the non-binding resolution 
goes on to say that such a prohibition is null 
and void if ‘‘such use of the Armed Forces is 
necessary and appropriate to defend against 
an imminent armed attack upon the United 
States, its territories or possessions, or its 
Armed Forces, consistent with the requirement 
of the War Powers Resolution.’’ 
Imminent armed attack on our Armed 
Forces and diplomats is precisely the Trump 
Administration’s justification for the drone 
strike against Soleimani. 
According to the Council on Foreign Rela-
tions, no president used drone strikes more 
than President Obama who ordered 542 drone 
strikes killing an estimated 3,797 people in-
cluding 324 civilians.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, today, this body 
will vote to reaffirm the fact that Congress has 
the sole power to declare war, as laid out in 
the Constitution. After nearly two decades at 
war, President Trump has further risked the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
America, 
our 
servicemembers, and our allies by escalating 
tensions with Iran to a dangerous new level. 
The Trump Administration’s military airstrike 
targeting highlevel Iranian officials is just an-
other example of President Trump under-
mining our national security by acting reck-
lessly and without sound legal authority or rea-
son. His rash decisions have made America 
less safe. War must always be our last re-
course, and any escalation that brings our na-
tion closer to a third disastrous war in the Mid-
dle East is unacceptable. The American peo-
ple will not stand for it. 
The War Powers Act exists as a safeguard 
against intensifying military actions that can 
accidentally lead to war. It ensures that a 
President will engage in a public conversation 
with the American people about the merits of 
war, before deploying their loved ones. The 
Trump Administration must now recognize 
Congress’s authority as a coequal branch of 
government and request, as well as justify, au-
thorization for any future military activity 
against Iran. Additionally, the Administration 
must work with Congress to ensure an imme-
diate, effective deescalation strategy that pre-
vents further violence. 
While I am proud to support the War Pow-
ers Resolution, this must be the first of many 
steps to reassert Congress’s responsibilities 
under Article 1 of the Constitution. I opposed 
the 2002 Iraq Authorization for the Use of Mili-
tary Force (AUMF) and have worked for the 
last decade to repeal it, including most re-
cently voting against the National Defense Au-
thorization Act when it failed to include a 
House-passed repeal. I was pleased the 
Speaker announced plans for the House to 
pass Congresswoman BARBARA LEE’s resolu-
tion to finally repeal the 2002 AUMF and Con-
gressman RO KHANNA’s legislation to prohibit 
funding for military action against Iran not au-
thorized by Congress. I am proud to cospon-
sor both of these bills. We owe it to our mili-
tary and civilian personnel, our allies, and 
every American to ensure that Congress up-
holds its constitutional authority to authorize 
the use of military force. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, this Admin-
istration’s impulsive and reckless behavior has 
made our nation and the men and women of 
our armed forces less safe. It has heightened 
the risk of a conflict in the Middle East and it 
has jeopardized our relationship with our al-
lies—both in the region and around the world. 
We should remember—not long ago, many 
Members of this body voted to ratify the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action or the Iran 
deal. That agreement was working, it was ac-
cepted by the world and, most of all, it was 
containing Iran from securing nuclear weap-
ons.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H115 
January 9, 2020 
President Trump and his Administration 
turned away from that agreement, setting off a 
chain reaction of events, which led to yester-
day’s attacks by Iran on American personnel 
who are serving in Iraq. 
We should be clear—no one in this body— 
Democrat or Republican—will mourn the loss 
of Soleimani. He was a monster who was re-
sponsible for horrible atrocities. However, we 
also have to question whether the actions 
taken by this Administration in killing him 
made our nation, our servicemembers and our 
allies safer or less safe. 
So where have the Trump Administration’s 
policies brought us? 
The government of Iraq is asking U.S. 
forces to leave. After thousands of American 
lives were lost and billions of dollars spent, 
our ally in the fight against ISIS appears to be 
moving toward expelling U.S. troops. 
Iran has announced that it is resuming ag-
gressive development of nuclear weapons. 
The people of Iran are coalescing behind their 
government, 
united 
in 
outrage 
from 
Soleimani’s killing. 
The United States government needs a 
comprehensive, well-considered strategy for 
Iran. That strategy needs to be explained to 
Congress—and more importantly to the Amer-
ican people. The rationale for killing Soleimani 
must be fully and publicly explained. I believe 
the American people people—when they hear 
the evidence—will agree that this action was 
not necessary to prevent an imminent attack. 
Most of all, we can no longer allow diplo-
macy and national security to be conducted 
through Twitter. 
The Resolution we will vote on today would 
prevent the Administration from pursuing addi-
tional military action against Iran without prop-
erly consulting Congress. 
We, as a nation, must learn from the mis-
takes of the past. We cannot allow our country 
to ignite another war by conducing foreign pol-
icy in an irresponsible, impulsive manner. 
The young people wearing our uniform 
abroad count on us to be better. We have a 
moral obligation to the millions of innocent ci-
vilians living in the Middle East who could per-
ish or lose loved ones or their homes if a 
broader conflict erupts. 
We must be better than this Administration 
has been. I urge my colleagues to support this 
Resolution. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
when the President of the United States ap-
proved airstrikes targeting General Qassem 
Soleimani, he did so without the authorization 
of, or consultation by, the Congress. Ameri-
cans stationed abroad are now categorically 
less safe than they were before the president 
took action. 
Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, no American 
will mourn the loss of General Soleimani—and 
nor should they. We are not here on the floor 
today to debate the merits of his assassina-
tion, but rather to address the failure of this 
Administration to adhere to the longstanding 
procedure of congressional consultation as 
mandated by the War Powers Resolution; spe-
cifically, the failure to properly and expedi-
tiously articulate to the Congress any intel-
ligence supporting the alleged threat which 
prompted this assassination. 
The Administration’s actions have already 
endangered the lives of many American 
servicemembers, diplomats, and foreign serv-
ice officers. I fear that the path we are on 
now, one lacking a coherent strategy moving 
forward, will only add to the instability of the 
region and lead to an extended conflict for 
which we are not prepared. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution simply reaffirms 
to the president and to the public Congress’s 
role in authorizing the use of military force. As 
representatives of Americans from every cor-
ner of the country, we deserve to have our 
voices heard in a serious discussion on the 
implications of yet another conflict in the Mid-
dle East. 
I plan to vote in favor of the resolution and 
would urge my colleagues to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 781, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
concurrent resolution, as amended. 
The question is on adoption of the 
concurrent resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on adoption of H. Con. 
Res. 83 will be followed by a 5-minute 
vote on the motion to suspend the 
rules and pass H.R. 5078.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise

have long been linked with adverse 
health effects, including cancer, im-
mune system effects, infertility, im-
paired child development, high choles-
terol, and thyroid disease. 
Mr. Chairman, the EPA has known 
about these risks for decades and has 
allowed this contamination to spread. 
Last year, EPA announced its PFAS 
Action Plan. It was woefully inad-
equate, and since that time, we have 
learned that EPA is not even keeping 
the weak commitments it made in that 
plan. The EPA failed to meet key end- 
of-the-year 2019 deadlines. It failed to 
produce a regulatory determination for 
drinking water. It failed to produce 
hazard determinations for chemicals 
under Superfund. It failed to initiate 
reporting under the Toxics Release In-
ventory. 
The Trump administration is failing 
hundreds of impacted communities, 
and Congress must act for communities 
like Hoosick Falls, New York; Parch-
ment, Michigan; Parkersburg, West 
Virginia; and far too many more. 
We need to act on behalf of States 
like my own State of New Jersey that 
are doing everything they can—adopt-
ing protective State drinking water 
standards and pursuing natural re-
source damage cases—but facing strong 
opposition from Federal agencies under 
the Trump administration. 
There have been over 500 detections 
of PFAS in drinking water and ground-
water sources in New Jersey, and this 
is simply unacceptable, Mr. Chairman. 
It is time for Congress to take action 
and use every tool available to stop the 
flow of PFAS pollution into our envi-
ronment and our bodies. That is ex-
actly what the PFAS Action Act does. 
This bill requires EPA to imme-
diately designate two PFAS chemicals 
as hazardous substances under Super-
fund, the two most studied of the 
PFAS chemicals. EPA committed to 
make this designation in their action 
plan last year but has failed to fulfill 
that promise. 
The legislation requires that, over a 
5-year period, EPA reviews all other 
PFAS chemicals and decide whether to 
list them under Superfund. During that 
5 years, the bill will require com-
prehensive health testing of all PFAS 
chemicals. 
This is a really important point. You 
may hear my colleagues talk today 
about the need to base decisions on 
science, and this bill will generate that 
science. The two chemicals will be reg-
ulated upfront because we already have 
the science on them. Other PFAS will 
be regulated if, over the next 5 years, 
the science concludes that they are 
hazardous. 
The bill also includes a moratorium 
on any new PFAS during that same 5- 
year period. This will provide EPA the 
time it needs to ensure it has enough 
science to really evaluate new PFAS. 
H.R. 535 also requires a drinking 
water standard that will cover at least 
the two chemicals and others at EPA’s 
discretion. Importantly, the drinking 
water standard will have to protect 
public health, including the health of 
vulnerable populations such as preg-
nant women, infants, and children. Be-
cause treating drinking water to re-
move PFAS is expensive, the bill in-
cludes grants for water utilities. 
Mr. Chairman, this bill includes a 
voluntary 
PFAS-free 
label 
for 
cookware, which may be expanded 
through amendments to include addi-
tional categories of consumer products. 
This label will empower consumers to 
take steps to protect themselves from 
exposure to PFAS. 
The bill requires guidance for first 
responders, to help them minimize 
their exposure to PFAS chemicals. 
This is important because PFAS is 
commonly found in firefighting foams. 
Taken together, this is a serious, 
comprehensive, 
and 
reasonable 
bill 
that should garner strong bipartisan 
support. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. 
I thank Chairman TONKO for all that 
he did to put this package together 
and, of course, the sponsor of the pack-
age, Mrs. DINGELL from Michigan, who 
has faced so many problems in your 
home State, Mr. Chairman, where Mrs. 
DINGELL is also very involved. 
The bill includes a number of pieces 
of legislation before our committee by 
members of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, as well as other Members 
of this body. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 6, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PALLONE: I write con-
cerning H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 
2019. There are certain provisions in this leg-
islation that fall within the Rule X jurisdic-
tion of the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure. 
In order to expedite floor consideration of 
H.R. 535, the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on 
the bill. However, this is conditional on our 
mutual understanding that forgoing consid-
eration of the bill would not prejudice the 
Committee with respect to the appointment 
of conferees or to any future jurisdictional 
claim over the subject matters contained in 
the bill or similar legislation that fall within 
the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I also 
request that you urge the Speaker to name 
members of this Committee to any con-
ference committee which is named to con-
sider such provisions. 
Please place a copy of this letter and your 
response acknowledging our jurisdictional 
interest into the Congressional Record dur-
ing consideration of H.R. 535 on the House 
floor. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, January 6, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 535, the 
PFAS Action Act of 2019, so that the bill 
may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I agree that your Committee 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as this bill or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that we may address any remaining 
issues within your jurisdiction. I would sup-
port your effort to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees from your 
Committee to any House-Senate conference 
on this legislation. 
I will place our letters on H.R. 535 into the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of the bill. I appreciate your coopera-
tion regarding this legislation and look for-
ward to continuing to work together as this 
measure moves through the legislative proc-
ess. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, many Members on 
both sides of the aisle have worked 
hard to understand and address the 
issues 
related 
to 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated compounds. While I op-
pose H.R. 535 for both policy and prac-
tical reasons, I commend all of my col-
leagues who have been engaged on this 
issue. 
Before I go into some of the more 
concerning aspects of this legislation, I 
think it is instructive to highlight a 
few facts. 
PFAS is not just one or two chemi-
cals. According to the EPA, this class 
of chemicals includes more than 5,000 
different 
substances 
with 
different 
properties, applications, and risks. In 
fact, EPA’s master list of PFAS on its 
website includes 7,866 derivations. 
EPA does not have health effects 
data on the vast majority of PFAS. In 
fact, EPA recently announced scientif-
ically valid methods—that means you 
are able to test to determine what it 
is—for just 29 of these 7,866. We don’t 
have the capability even to understand 
if it is present because we don’t have 
the capability even to identify them. 
EPA has actively engaged in a PFAS 
action program involving many dis-
ciplines across the agency. I recently 
talked to the Administrator to urge 
him to move as quickly as possible 
with 
multiple 
action 
items 
and 
timelines. 
Now, enter this bill, H.R. 535. This 
legislation requires aggressive regu-
latory responses to this diverse class of 
man-made chemicals without regard to 
science or risk. This is an unprece-
dented way of conducting science and 
flies in the face of decades of U.S. envi-
ronmental policy. In fact, we have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H118 
January 9, 2020 
never legislatively banned a chemical 
in all the years since the Superfund, 
back in 1980. 
To my colleagues who love to preach 
science on climate change, I hear you, 
but you cannot walk away from the 
science debate when it doesn’t support 
your policy position. Let me say that 
again. For my Democratic friends who 
love to preach science, you can’t walk 
away from the science debate on this 
and walk away from the fact that we 
need a scientific study of this. They are 
trying to have it both ways. 
I know many of my Democratic col-
leagues think this bill is essential be-
cause they don’t trust the EPA run by 
this President. I understand that is 
your call. But I would also ask you to 
think about the mandates you are plac-
ing on the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which will far outlast this ad-
ministration. They will legally ham-
string future ones from facing issues 
other than PFAS, whether it is lead or 
climate. 
I mentioned that science-based deci-
sions that have supported EPA’s work 
for years are being jettisoned, but that 
is just one feature. The more long- 
range trouble includes the automatic 
designation of PFOS and PFOA as haz-
ardous substances under the Super-
fund, which is called the Comprehen-
sive Environmental Response, Com-
pensation, and Liability Act, CERCLA. 
This designation may be warranted, 
but under this bill, it would come with-
out knowledge of who is responsible, 
where PFAS contamination is, how se-
rious it is, and without any public com-
ment. 
In fact, my colleagues think that 
putting it in the Superfund is going to 
solve this problem and that they are 
going to be able to clean it up right 
away. Well, I have a list here of Super-
fund sites. The Superfund was set up in 
1980. We have a site here that is still a 
Superfund site back to 1983. 
So those of you who think, put it in 
the Superfund, and it is all going to be 
cleaned up, good luck. If you have dealt 
with this issue, it is not going to hap-
pen, probably, in your lifetime. 
Don’t get me started on the perverse 
strict, joint and several, and retro-
active liability to releases of hazardous 
substances, a trial lawyer’s bonanza. 
We know the majority understands 
this is an issue because the rule exe-
cuted 
provisions 
relieving 
airports 
from Superfund liability. Plus, the bill 
requires EPA to review all 7,864 PFAS 
in 5 years to determine without public 
comment whether they present a sub-
stantial danger. 
We can’t do 29 in 20 years. How are 
we going to do 7,866 chemicals in 5 
years? It just can’t be done. 
While a Superfund designation for 
just PFOS and PFOA may seem reason-
able, the reality is section 15 of H.R. 
535 deems all PFAS as hazardous air 
pollutants under Clean Air Act section 
112(b). This automatically makes the 
entire PFAS class hazardous under the 
Superfund law. 
As I mentioned, innocent parties like 
drinking water utilities that just treat-
ed what they got from their source 
water are hostage to endless liability 
for cleanup, regardless of their per-
sonal contribution. In fact, I would 
argue they didn’t make any contribu-
tion. Why not exclude the water dis-
tricts from Superfund liability if they 
are just passthroughs? No, we are tak-
ing care of the airports, but we are not 
protecting municipal water systems, 
co-op water systems, and other sources 
of drinking water, and we are going to 
put additional mandates and costs on 
them. 
I know communities with PFAS pol-
lution want it cleaned up quickly, but 
nothing, as I said before, with CERCLA 
is fast. It is always more expensive 
than you think, and the stigma of the 
designation scars a community’s econ-
omy and dampens its future prospects. 
Other significant problems with this 
legislation include section 4, which 
places a commercial moratorium on 
new PFAS chemicals for 5 years, even 
though Federal law already prevents 
any unsafe chemical from entering the 
market until EPA scientifically re-
views it and determines its safety. This 
delays 
cleaner, 
greener, 
and 
safer 
chemicals from coming on the market. 
Let me repeat this. Existing law bans 
and bars any new chemical or new use 
of an existing chemical from going to 
the market unless EPA signs off on 
that and it meets a tough safety stand-
ard. This bill places an arbitrary ban 
on top of that review. Next-generation 
heart valves, car brakes, solar panels, 
and military equipment all will be 
stopped from coming to market be-
cause of this. 
b 1830 
Section 3 creates an unrealistic man-
date on EPA to require all manufactur-
ers and processor testing of PFAS. This 
requirement overlaps one that compa-
nies send all their existing PFAS infor-
mation to the EPA by 2023. 
Regardless, why even bother doing 
real science when you have already 
made a decision based on political 
science? More practically, does EPA 
even have the resources to keep up 
with such a demand? We could have 
asked them had they been invited to 
testify on this legislation. 
These are not minor concerns. They 
sparked opposition, especially in the 
Senate, and are the reason why these 
items were not included in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. If 
this process is making good law instead 
of messaging, I would urge my col-
leagues to keep that in mind when vot-
ing. We can do better. 
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), the ranking 
member of the full committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want 
to thank Mr. SHIMKUS for yielding to 
me. He has really poured his heart and 
soul into this issue and has worked 
very hard on it, is so knowledgeable 
about it. And he is spot on. 
Tragically, there is no science here. 
The EPA was not allowed to testify 
here. This is a solution that will never 
become law. It completely overreaches. 
You are going to hear from some of 
our Members, including Dr. BUCSHON, 
who is a heart surgeon, about the im-
pact this could have on new tech-
nologies and devices that get im-
planted into people’s hearts. 
You will hear about automobiles and 
aircraft that use these very specialized 
chemicals and materials in their manu-
facturing processes that probably have 
nothing to do with what we are trying 
to fix here. 
You will hear, and it is true, that 
this is the first time we are going to 
throw science out the window and 
make a political decision. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I must rise in oppo-
sition to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act 
of 2020, and urge my colleagues, sadly, 
to do the same. 
We all want a solution to the coun-
try’s PFAS challenges. And while there 
is more work to be done, I would say, 
thanks to Mr. SHIMKUS
and others, 
Congress has already acted to provide 
some funding for reducing PFAS in 
drinking water in rural and economi-
cally distressed areas. 
We require the Federal Government 
to 
enter 
into 
cooperative 
cleanup 
agreements for Federal facilities with 
PFAS contamination. 
But we all know more needs to be 
done. 
Unfortunately, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle have chosen to 
go partisan with H.R. 535, and that is 
not the way to go, it is not the solu-
tion. 
This follows two plays Democrats in-
sist on running ad nauseam: putting 
politics over progress and pushing leg-
islation that will never become law. 
This was the playbook they ran in 
December when, sadly, they walked 
away from progress in protecting pub-
lic health that resulted in two major 
missed opportunities. 
First, we had the chance to mandate 
that the EPA establish a drinking 
water standard for PFOA and PFOS 
within 2 years. We had that oppor-
tunity to get it into law. 
Second, we could have ensured imme-
diate and mandatory cleanup of PFOA 
and PFOS at all Department of Defense 
facilities. We could have put that into 
law. We were in agreement except for 
Democrats here, and as a result, they 
wouldn’t take yes for an answer, and 
we lost those opportunities. 
But back to H.R. 535. This measure is 
packed with bad policy and unfortu-
nately, or fortunately, is dead on ar-
rival in the Senate. 
Sadly, it delays much needed action 
to enact science-based solutions that 
protect our constituents. So this hurts 
Americans, it leaves our communities 
vulnerable, and it did not have to be 
this way. 
During the Energy and Commerce 
Committee’s consideration of H.R. 535, 
we had a very robust debate on this

bill. Mr. SHIMKUS offered a package of 
proposals that had bipartisan Senate 
support, and those all could have be-
come law; in other words, a three-quar-
ters agreement of the committees of 
jurisdiction. 
These proposals were not the way he 
or I would have crafted them on our 
own, but we were willing to com-
promise, we were willing to reach 
across the aisle, we were willing to 
reach across the chamber to the Sen-
ate, because we wanted to be part of 
the solution. 
Sadly, we are here today with a bill 
that, frankly, reaches a new low. 
Last month, we had a vehicle to 
make real, meaningful progress on 
drinking water standards and PFAS 
cleanup. We could have done more, but 
that progress was stopped and this bill 
was brought forward. 
So, Mr. Chair, I want to help commu-
nities deal with PFAS concerns. I want 
to do it in a scientifically-based way. 
It is important the actions we take 
are appropriately measured and justi-
fied and backed up by science. This 
package, though, is not a practical, 
science-based solution. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our majority leader, 
and 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
him 
for 
prioritizing this PFAS package and 
making it one of the first things that 
we do in 2020. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
gentleman for his comments. Nobody 
has fought harder than Mr. PALLONE 
and Mr. TONKO to make sure that this 
legislation moves forward. And, of 
course, we worked very hard with the 
Senate to try to have these protections 
included in the Senate bill. Unfortu-
nately, we didn’t get there. 
Mr. Chairman, while I am glad that 
Congress was able to take small steps 
to address the hazards of PFAS con-
tamination through passage of the 2020 
defense authorization bill last month, 
that action alone was not enough. That 
is why the House is taking further ac-
tion this week. 
These contaminants, known as for-
ever chemicals, because they do not 
break down and can remain in the 
human body for many years, have been 
shown to raise one’s risk of deadly can-
cers, reproductive and immune system 
disorders, and other health problems. 
For decades, we have known that 
PFAS contamination is a problem. 
According to the EPA, millions of 
Americans are exposed to unsafe levels 
of PFAS through their drinking water. 
The Trump administration, under its 
own PFAS Action Plan, promised to es-
tablish a drinking water standard by 
the end of last year. Let me repeat 
that. The administration planned to 
have a standard by the end of last year. 
Unfortunately, that has not been ac-
complished. It has taken neither of the 
steps that it indicated it would, mak-
ing this legislation very necessary. 
That is why the House is considering 
PFAS legislation this week introduced 
by Congresswoman DINGELL and Con-
gressman UPTON, a bipartisan piece of 
legislation. 
Mr. Chair, I want to congratulate 
Mrs. DINGELL for her continuing lead-
ership on this issue. I also want to 
thank the others who have worked on 
this legislation, including the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire, CHRIS 
PAPPAS. 
The package of 12 bills was approved 
by the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee in a bipartisan vote in Novem-
ber. Its provisions will, among others, 
establish a protective safe drinking 
water standard for PFAS contamina-
tion based upon science; improved test-
ing of existing PFAS chemicals; limit 
the introduction of new ones; and pro-
vide for their safe disposal. 
Most importantly, it will begin the 
process of helping clean up PFAS-con-
taminated sites under the Superfund 
program. 
Critically 
important, 
particularly 
the sponsors are fighting contaminated 
sites in their own areas. 
The Defense Department, which for 
years has used firefighting foam con-
taining PFAS chemicals, has failed to 
clean up sites across the country that 
have contaminated the drinking water 
of countless Americans. 
Why is that? 
Because the EPA has failed to list 
these chemicals under the Superfund 
law, notwithstanding their toxic and 
adverse effects. 
This legislation is a major action 
aimed at safeguarding public health 
and protecting Americans’ access to 
clean and safe drinking water. 
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Rep-
resentative DINGELL for her leadership 
on this issue; her partner, FRED UPTON, 
the former chairman of the committee; 
Chairman PALLONE and subcommittee 
Chairman TONKO
of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, who have both 
done extraordinary work on this legis-
lation. 
Mr. Chair, I also want to thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO
of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
for his committee’s efforts to address 
this issue as well. 
Mr. Chair, I commend the 50 mem-
bers of the bipartisan House PFAS 
Task Force—50 members, bipartisan— 
who have been working diligently on 
this issue for years. 
Mr. Chair, I also commend Rep-
resentative CHRIS PAPPAS and ANTONIO 
DELGADO from New York, who have 
both focused very much on this issue 
and believe this legislation is critical. 
This legislation may be the first 
comprehensive PFAS bill brought to 
the House floor, but I doubt it will be 
the last. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues 
to join in voting for this bill. I hope 
that the Senate will take it up without 
delay and send it to the President’s 
desk for approval with the strong bi-
partisan support it deserves. 
I might mention that I have had ex-
tensive conversations with a former 
Member of this House, now the Senator 
from Delaware, TOM CARPER, who has 
been very focused on this. And the di-
rector of his committee, who used to 
work for me, Mary Frances Repko, who 
is one of the most knowledgeable peo-
ple I know, she has talked to me about 
this legislation. 
Mr. Chair, I want to thank the com-
mittee, I want to thank the sponsors 
who have worked so hard on this, and I 
am glad that we could bring this to the 
floor at the first opportunity. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BUCSHON), a cardiothoracic surgeon. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, we all 
want to keep our communities safe 
from chemicals that can pose a threat 
to the health of our constituents. How-
ever, we need to get the solution right 
and not settle on a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach. 
As currently written, the PFAS Ac-
tion Act does not get it right, because 
it would impose Superfund liability 
under CERCLA on lifesaving and other 
medically 
beneficial 
products 
that 
have already undergone a rigorous ap-
proval process conducted by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration to en-
sure they are safe to use in medicine. 
To designate these lifesaving devices 
as a hazardous substance is inappro-
priate and may cost American lives. 
That is why I am disappointed that 
my amendment to exempt FDA-ap-
proved or -cleared products from liabil-
ity under section 107 of CERCLA with 
respect to PFAS was not made in 
order. 
As a physician, I have firsthand expe-
rience with lifesaving medical devices 
that include PFAS, such as vascular 
grafts, stent grafts, heart patches, 
catheter tubes, and more. 
In fact, this medical device right 
here, which you see pictured behind 
me, is used to close what is called an 
atrial septal defect, a procedure used to 
close a hole in the heart. This product 
contains 
polytetrafluoroethylene, 
a 
PFAS. 
As a surgeon, I used to have to per-
form open heart surgery, with weeks of 
recovery and rehab for patients after 
this procedure. 
This device now allows it to be done 
sometimes as an outpatient. 
This bill, as it stands, would deny 
Hoosiers and Americans the healing 
power of modern medical devices using 
PFAS, and instead, lead to costly liti-
gation, which would increase the un-
derlying costs of healthcare. 
We must be careful before instituting 
a one-size-fits-all approach to PFAS. 
Mr. Chair, for that reason, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose the legislation. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Will the gentleman 
yield for purposes of colloquy? 
Mr. BUCSHON. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS). 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Just to clarify: one is 
that we are exempting airports from 
Superfund liability, but we are not ex-
empting medical devices that are FDA 
approved in infants’ bodies?

Mr. BUCSHON. That is my under-

Mr. BUCSHON. Well, because it has 
not been shown to be toxic. It has been 
approved by the FDA and shown to be 
safe for patient use. And we might not 
be able to use them in the future if it 
is declared toxic. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I thank 
the cardiothoracic surgeon for yield-
ing. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I want to respond to some-
thing I keep hearing from my Repub-
lican colleagues, which is the argument 
that we should abandon important pro-
posals because the Senate simply will 
not accept them. 
We cannot control the Senate, but we 
have the ability and the responsibility 
to pass strong legislation through this 
body and work as hard as we can to get 
it enacted. 
I believe in the prerogative and 
power of the House of Representatives 
to do what is right, and so I can only 
hope that the Senate will follow our 
example. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL), a champion on this issue. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for his leadership, and Chairman PAL-
LONE’s leadership on all of these issues. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 535. 
Exactly 1 year ago, I introduced the 
PFAS Action Act, and have been joined 
by many of my colleagues in this effort 
in the last year. 
b 1845 
I promised my constituents that we 
would take serious steps to address 
that issue, and that is what we are 
doing today. 
Let us be very clear: PFAS is an ur-
gent public health and environmental 
threat, and the number of contamina-
tion sites nationwide is growing at an 
alarming rate, including our military 
bases. 
PFAS 
chemicals 
are 
everywhere. 
They are in our nonstick cookware; 
they are in food containers; they are in 
carpet, clothing, cosmetics, and fire-
fighting foams, just to name a few. 
PFAS is persistent. It accumulates in 
your body, and it is toxic. They are 
manmade, and they are known as a for-
ever chemical. They don’t break down 
in the environment; they don’t break 
down in your body; and they don’t 
break down in the wildlife. 
Exposure to PFAS, even at low lev-
els, poses significant health risks, and 
we know that now. In a recent review, 
the CDC identified a number of health 
effects associated with PFAS exposure, 
including cancer, liver damage, de-
creased fertility, and an increased risk 
of asthma and thyroid disease. 
Experts believe that as many as 99 
percent—some people say 97. I have an 
official source that says 99. Who cares 
what that number is, because most 
Americans at that level have PFAS in 
their blood, and they don’t even know 
it. 
Michigan has been hit hard. It is 
ground zero for where PFAS has been 
identified. We have 74 sites, but only 
because, after Flint, we learned. We 
look and try to keep our citizens from 
being poisoned. 
According 
to 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group, PFAS has been de-
tected in the drinking water of more 
than 1400 communities across the coun-
try; and those drinking water systems 
serve 19 million people in this country, 
including 300 military installations 
that have been identified. 
In my district, PFAS is in the water 
in the Huron River, and we can’t eat 
the fish. I was at a townhall meeting 
and a man got up—he was older—and 
said to me: I used to eat that fish. I re-
lied on it. When will I be able to eat it 
again? 
I didn’t want to say this to him, but 
the fact of the matter is probably not 
in his lifetime. 
Most of these sites are not being 
cleaned up. And the number of sites is 
expected to grow across the country as 
more States do the testing they need 
to do to protect their citizens, to find 
PFAS. 
But the most troubling thing is that 
the manufacturing companies know 
the danger of PFAS and even tracked 
it in the blood of their employees, 
while the EPA has completely aban-
doned its responsibility to act swiftly 
and comprehensively. 
And our military is saying they don’t 
have to clean it up. Why? Because it is 
not listed under CERCLA and because 
they are not required to do so. 
Here is the reality. We are not clean-
ing up the contamination. We don’t 
even have a protective drinking water 
standard. 
And you talk about science, Gov-
ernor Rick Snyder, a Republican, ap-
pointed a scientific community that 
said that the guideline—not a stand-
ard—isn’t stringent enough to protect 
human life. 
Now, EPA keeps coming and testi-
fying before our committee, and they 
say they are going to do it soon, but I 
sure don’t see them doing it. 
Do you all realize that exposures to 
contaminated water, air, and soil that 
include PFAS and toxins kill more peo-
ple than smoking, hunger, war, natural 
disaster, AIDS, and malaria together? 
Did the Flint water crisis not teach 
us in this Congress and the country 
something? 
Mr. Chair, I thank all of my col-
leagues who have worked on this issue. 
When you know the facts, I don’t un-
derstand how anybody could let Amer-
ican people be poisoned, and it is time 
for us to act. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 1 minute to respond. 
Mr. Chair, if all this whole class of 
7,866 chemicals is so dangerous, why 
does FDA allow us to implant them in 
the hearts of infant children? 
If this is so dangerous—there may be 
a couple that are bad, we are not dis-
puting that, but the entire class? 
If it is so bad, why does the FDA say 
it is okay for food packaging? 
If it is so bad, why didn’t my friends 
in the Obama administration, in that 
EPA ban it? Because they want to do 
the scientific analysis. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 535, the PFAS 
Action Act, sponsored by Congress-
woman 
DINGELL
and 
Congressman 
UPTON. 
The EPA has acknowledged that 
PFAS chemical exposure can lead to 
adverse 
health 
effects 
for 
human 
beings, but it has been very slow to do 
anything about it. 
PFAS chemicals present a clear and 
present danger to communities all over 
the United States. They are linked to 
cancer, can cause birth defects, disrupt 
thyroid hormones, and affect the im-
mune system. 
Beyond the military, where it is all 
over our bases, the chemicals can be 
found in food packaging, commercial 
household products, our workplaces, 
and our drinking water; and certain 
PFAS chemicals are so dangerous that 
they are no longer manufactured in the 
United States. 
Mr. Chair, we need to pass this bill, 
as we have done once before. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, might I in-
quire of the time that is remaining for 
our side. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from 
New York has 18 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Illinois has 141⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. TONKO. I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chair, there was an 
excellent question posed by a nonphysi-
cian as to why it would be safe for a 
medical device to exist within the baby 
and approved by the FDA, and I think 
it is important to understand the phys-
iology of what is the pathophysiology 
of these chemicals in the human body. 
The danger with these chemicals is 
when they actually cross either the 
air-blood barrier or are deposited into 
tissue, whether they are ingested, in-
haled in a specific form, that then gets 
deposited and accumulates over time. 
When they are packaged in a specific 
device, they don’t necessarily start to 
get 
absorbed 
or 
within 
a 
certain 
amount to prevent certain illnesses. 
But when you break them down into

chemical reactions to actually get de-
posited, then that is when you come up 
with illnesses. 
That is why it is so dangerous, be-
cause in terms of the tissue, in terms 
of the route of ingestion, in terms of 
the different forms of the way it is ac-
cumulated, it can have dire effects. 
Ninety-seven percent of Americans 
have or have had harmful PFAS chemi-
cals in their bloodstream. They are 
known as forever chemicals because, 
once consumed, they take years and 
years and years to leave your body. 
We eat these chemicals when our 
foods are stored in PFAS-containing 
packages. And, like I said, there is 
some leakage there. We drink them 
when they accumulate in our drinking 
water in their most basic form. And 
PFAS can also be passed along during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding when they 
are in their smallest form as well. 
Even small levels of exposure to 
PFAS have been shown to harm peo-
ple’s immune systems. 
Again, this is through the medical- 
scientific literature. The medical-sci-
entific literature has shown that small 
levels of exposure to PFAS have shown 
harm to people’s immune systems, in-
crease their risk of certain types of 
cancer, and affect thyroid function. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Mr. TONKO. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. RUIZ. Even small levels of PFAS 
can be harmful to the public’s health. 
The PFAS Action Act of 2019 will 
help address this public health issue by 
establishing a maximum contaminant 
level for PFAS in drinking water, pro-
vide funds to help communities remove 
PFAS from their drinking water, and 
require 
continuing 
monitoring 
of 
PFAS. It also provides millions specifi-
cally for disadvantaged communities 
harmed by PFAS-affected water sys-
tems. 
Having clean water to drink is a com-
mon good for everyone, not a privilege 
for the few. 
I urge everybody to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Chair, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, on my time, I have a ques-
tion for the gentleman from California 
(Mr. RUIZ). I have great respect for the 
doctor and his medical knowledge—just 
two questions. 
One, if the medical device has been 
made, right, and then there is a defect, 
so they throw it away, and if we have 
labeled that as a toxic chemical, then 
that chemical in the municipal waste 
now becomes a Superfund site; right? 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia. 
Mr. RUIZ. I do not know the answer. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. The answer is, under 
current law, H.R. 535, not amended, the 
answer is yes. 
So why would they make it? 
Mr. RUIZ. What I can answer is that 
PFAS can be harmful to one’s health 
even though they may have a utility 
for a medical device. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. No, I understand the 
physiology. I got that. I am just telling 
you the problem with this bill. 
But the question is, the device, la-
beled as toxic, thrown in a municipal 
waste field would then become a Super-
fund site under current law. 
And then I guess the other question I 
would ask the doctor is: There are 7,866 
permutations 
of 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated compounds. I would 
ask the doctor, which one is he refer-
ring to? 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, our constitu-
ents across America would be surprised 
to know that so many of these districts 
have been poisoned by a chemical they 
never even heard of, the PFOS and 
PFAS chemicals. But they would be 
even more shocked to know that the 
very cookware that they cook their 
meals to serve to their little kids and 
to their families contain that very poi-
son. So why wouldn’t we want to let 
them know, give them a heads-up? 
And then, turning to Florida, we had 
a cancer cluster in Ocala, Florida, that 
hurt countless firefighters. If we are 
not here to protect little kids and fire-
fighters, why are we here? 
We don’t need to wait for the Senate 
to tell us whether we can act or not. 
We need to act now, and that is why I 
am supporting this bill. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, H.R. 535 lists 
only PFOA and PFOS under Superfund 
and leaves decisions for all other PFAS 
to EPA. EPA has already committed to 
listing PFOA and PFOS under Super-
fund and has been working on the list-
ing since 2018. The bill will speed up 
that listing, so that cleanup of existing 
contamination starts sooner, but does 
not change how Superfund will apply. 
The two PFAS that will be listed 
under Superfund by this bill have al-
ready been phased out by industry 
under a voluntary EPA partnership 
more than a decade ago. 
b 1900 
They are not being made in this 
country anymore. So no one producing 
airplane door seals or heart stents or 
any other product is using the chemi-
cals listed under the bill. The FDA is 
not approving heart stents made of 
these chemicals. 
Most of those products are actually 
made from PTFE, better known as Tef-
lon. The companies who make and use 
PTFE believe it is not hazardous. If 
that is true, the testing regime in this 
bill will show it to be true. And if it is 
true, the EPA will not list it under 
Superfund. 
The bill leaves the listing decision 
for PTFE and all other PFAS currently 
produced in this country to EPA. It 
gives the EPA 5 years to evaluate those 
chemicals and supplies them with the 
needed science. 
This is a reasonable approach that 
will not regulate PFAS chemicals that 
are found to be nonhazardous and will 
take no immediate action on PFAS 
chemicals still being made. 
I also want to note that FDA review 
and CERCLA listing are not incon-
sistent. FDA review looks at whether a 
product is safe and effective for specific 
uses. CERCLA focuses on whether a 
chemical is hazardous when released 
into the environment. 
Many items that have important, 
even lifesaving uses, are not safe when 
dumped into the environment. And to 
be clear, the FDA is not recommending 
that healthy individuals implant PFAS 
into their bodies. The FDA is making a 
careful decision that someone in need 
of a heart stent is served by this device 
more than they are harmed. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I thank Rep-
resentative TONKO for yielding. 
Article I, section 27 of the Pennsyl-
vania Constitution, States: ‘‘The peo-
ple have a right to clean air, to pure 
water.’’ 
Similar in spirit, the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s website proclaims 
that: ‘‘The mission of EPA is to protect 
human health and the environment.’’ 
Unfortunately, EPA has taken only 
halting steps to deal with our PFAS 
water contamination challenge, despite 
its ongoing harm to human health. 
EPA’s website describes those harms: 
‘‘low infant birth weights, effects on 
the immune system, cancer . . . and 
thyroid hormone disruption.’’ 
I rise in support of H.R. 535 which 
will require EPA to mandate cleanup of 
contaminated sites, set air emission 
limits, and limit new PFAS chemicals 
in the marketplace; 
Identify health risks by requiring 
comprehensive health testing, report-
ing and monitoring; 
Require a national PFAS drinking 
water standard that creates clarity for 
States and municipalities; 
Holds polluters accountable. 
I am pleased to have worked on this 
public health issue and to see that part 
of my bill, H.R. 2600, included, which 
will require EPA to develop needed 
rules for safe PFAS disposal. 
I rise in support of this bill. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, just a couple of points. Ob-
viously, we have numerous problems 
with all of the sections of this bill. 
The one that is also troubling is the 
5-year ban, because under TSCA, which 
we worked on, passed in a bipartisan 
manner, no new chemicals can come to 
the market unless it is safe. 
So what this bill does, is already 
label a per- or polyfluorinated com-
pound that could be very lifesaving and 
helpful, it puts a scarlet letter on them 
beforehand and it doesn’t allow it. 
Chemistry 
is 
the 
future, 
cleaner, 
greener, and it is the future for an EV 
world, super computing, you name it.

But 
we 
are 
banning 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated compounds. Now re-
member, there are 7,866 different per-
mutations of this. So where we accept 
the premise that there may be some 
that are terrible, we are not accepting 
the premise that they are all bad, and 
that is what this bill does. 
I also want to highlight that Super-
fund 
designation 
is 
not 
salvation. 
Eielson Air Force base in Fairbanks, 
Alaska, went on the Superfund site No-
vember 21, 1989. It is still there after 30 
years. So just think about the commu-
nity now that has been stigmatized 
under a Superfund designation, and 
they are not going to be able to rede-
velop, retrain, rebuild, and grow the 
economy. 
I have a whole list of these things 
from 30 years, 32 years, 30, 35 years ago. 
Most of us have dealt with Superfund 
sites in our district. I have. They are 
no fun and they are not helpful, and it 
takes forever. 
Talking about forever chemicals, we 
are talking about forever Superfund 
sites, and that is what you are signing 
up for in this debate. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, to the 
gentleman from New York, I would like 
to enter into a colloquy regarding creo-
sote contamination in the 18th Con-
gressional District. 
I certainly rise to support enthu-
siastically H.R. 535. For decades the 
residents of the Fifth Ward and sur-
rounding areas, residential areas in 
Houston, which is located on the north-
ern side of my district, have long sus-
pected that creosote was making them 
sick. They were exposed to creosote 
through soil and water contamination 
through a railroad yard. 
Last April, during a community 
meeting I hosted for residents on the 
topic of creosote contamination, I re-
quested a cancer study from the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality 
after person after person spoke about 
cancer and their relative dying. 
The study found that three adult res-
piratory-system-related 
cancers 
oc-
curred in that Fifth Ward and sur-
rounding areas, including Kashmere 
Gardens. The cancers included, lung 
and bronchus, esophagus, and larynx. 
Toxic substances, such as creosote, 
should not be in common use where 
human activity is present, and it 
should not take decades for hazardous 
environmental concerns expressed by 
citizens to get addressed. 
Mr. TONKA. Will the gentlewoman 
yield? 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the 
gentleman from New York for the pur-
pose of a colloquy. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, creosote is 
listed as a hazardous substance under 
the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability 
Act, CERCLA, for the purpose of 
Superfund cleanup sites for the assign-
ments of liability. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Texas an additional 
1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. TONKO. The mechanisms for re-
porting on potential toxicants should 
allow citizens ready access to informa-
tion on what they can do to alert au-
thorities to environmental threats. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The commu-
nities like the Fifth Ward and sur-
rounding areas in Houston can be in-
valuable to assisting agencies in iden-
tifying ways to improve on the infor-
mation provided to the general public— 
they live it every day. These are life or 
death issues—on the means and meth-
ods available to citizens to report envi-
ronmental concerns and how these 
products are used amongst the commu-
nity for products that are very needed 
in the community, and have those con-
cerns adequately addressed. 
Mr. TONKO. The public is vital to 
the work of environmental protection, 
and I look forward to learning more 
about the residents of the Fifth Ward 
and surrounding communities, and the 
gentlewoman’s efforts to address creo-
sote contamination. And I thank the 
gentlewoman for bringing this to the 
attention of the committee and Mem-
bers of Congress. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentleman very much, and 
as I leave the floor, just want to take 
note of the contamination in the State 
of Texas and this is what we are fight-
ing. 
Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the House 
Committee on Homeland Security, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action 
Act of 2019, which will regulate in a com-
prehensive fashion Per- and poly- fluoroalkyl 
substances (referred to as PFAS). 
I support the legislation because it also pro-
tects public health by containing provisions to 
clean up contaminated sites. 
I have long held concerns regarding envi-
ronmental justice issues that impact urban and 
rural communities who disproportionately face 
problems associated with contaminated water, 
soil, and air pollution. 
My work to protect residents of the 18th 
Congressional District from harms caused by 
contaminants over the last year include: creo-
sote ground water contamination and the op-
position of permitting of a cement manufac-
turing facility near residential spaces in Fifth 
Ward Houston and Acres Homes respectively. 
Through a series of major community meet-
ings on environmental hazards I held last year 
I can attest that people are literally fighting for 
their lives and the lives of their children be-
cause of disparate conditions regarding man-
aging containment and cleanup of an existing 
ground water creosote contamination site and 
the threat of cement dust contamination of a 
residential area if a State issued permit be al-
lowed to stand. 
Concerns about the health impact of creo-
sote and other harms to human health have 
existed in Acres Homes and 5th Ward Hous-
ton for decades. 
Because of recent actions on the part of the 
responsible party for containing the effects of 
creosote contamination of ground water, I 
called a community meeting including all rel-
evant entities in April of 2019. 
As an action item from that meeting I re-
quested, that the Texas Commission on Envi-
ronmental Quality arrange a cancer cluster 
study of the 5th Ward area of Houston that 
would be conducted by the Texas Department 
of State Health Services (DSHS). 
The DSHS analyzed census tracts in Hous-
ton to determine the incidences of cancer. 
The analysis examined cancers—specifically 
those associated with adults. 
The study analyzed a half-dozen types of 
adults referencing cancers in the Texas Can-
cer Registry. 
It concluded that ‘‘the numbers of esoph-
agus, lung and bronchus and larynx cancers 
were statistically significantly greater than is 
expected based on cancer rates in Texas.’’ 
The DSHS’s work was incomplete—we do 
need more data. 
This report, however, confirmed the fears of 
constituents in my district, as expressed at my 
April town hall meeting. 
According to the report, incidences of can-
cer outside of normal probabilities has oc-
curred in 5th Ward Houston. 
Specifically, the DSHS analyzed the Texas 
Cancer Registry available from 2000 to 2016, 
as it relates to the affected areas, in which 
‘‘[l]ung, bronchus esophagus, and larynx can-
cers were statistically significantly greater than 
expected.’’ 
The report also found that the types of can-
cers which were identified in the study are 
consistent with those present in arsenic, which 
comprises creosote. 
Given the findings of the DSHS report, and 
the impact this has on the health and 
wellbeing on my constituents in Kashmere 
Gardens, I will be working to address the need 
to place energy and effort to address commu-
nity environmental concerns more effectively. 
And there have been critical, tangible health 
consequences to the emergence of these can-
cer 
clusters 
for 
decades 
that 
went 
uninvestigated. 
In my April community meeting and in De-
cember during a media event and tour, I heard 
stories that were stark in their nature, compel-
ling and tragic on the incidence of illness and 
cancer that has plagued residents of 5th 
Ward. 
Speaker after speaker at these community 
meetings spoke of the existence of the cancer, 
either in themselves or in their relatives. 
It was startling. 
One participant spoke of having a vegetable 
garden and concerns about whether it was 
safe to eat the food grown. 
Another resident spoke of a recent diag-
nosis of cancer and the number of neighbors 
and family members who had contracted can-
cers over the years. 
The open over 20 feet deep creosote dip-
ping pit that abutted back yards of residents 
for decades was real. 
The runoff from rain storms tainted with cre-
osote that filled ditches with oily black and 
brown smelly residue happened. 
The persistent smell of creosote near where 
they lived was constant. 
A few weeks ago, I walked Lavender and 
Lily streets and engaged with residents who 
had thyroid cancer or lung cancer who shared

their stories with me in hopes that something 
can be done. 
I remain concerned about the existence of 
cancer clusters in Houston’s Fifth Ward. 
The safety and well-being of the Kashmere 
Gardens Community and surrounding areas 
are my overriding concern. 
My advocacy on this issue and on behalf of 
those identified in the city is longstanding and 
unwavering, and I will not relent until the com-
munity and its citizens have answers about 
the impact creosote has in the lives and health 
of my constituents. 
This is why I am in strong support of H.R. 
535. 
This legislation addresses PFAS chemicals, 
which are an urgent public health threat be-
cause PFAS are persistent, bioaccumulative, 
and toxic, and communities across the country 
are discovering PFAS contamination in their 
air, land, and water. 
Mr. Chair, PFAS are a class of man-made 
chemicals 
defined 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
fluorinated carbon atom, the strongest carbon 
bond possible. 
Because of this bond, these chemicals are 
extremely persistent in the environment and 
are known to bioaccumulate in humans and 
wildlife, which is why they are called ‘‘forever 
chemicals.’’ 
PFAS have long been linked with adverse 
health effects including cancer, immune sys-
tem effects, infertility, impaired child develop-
ment, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease. 
Contamination has been found across the 
country, much of it around industrial facilities 
and Department of Defense installations. 
According to monitoring by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA), millions of 
Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of 
PFAS through their drinking water. 
Mr. Chair, it is urgent that this Congress 
enact this legislation because the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Administration and indus-
try have failed to address known threats pre-
sented by PFAS chemicals. 
EPA and industry have known about the 
risks from PFAS chemicals for decades but 
failed to act to prevent the spread of this con-
tamination. 
Industry studies showing adverse health ef-
fects as early as 1950 have now been made 
public. 
EPA has recognized the risk of these 
chemicals since at least 1995, when the agen-
cy amended its polymer exemption to exclude 
new PFAS chemicals. 
Despite that knowledge, EPA took no action 
on PFOA and PFOS until 2006, and then re-
lied on a voluntary industry phase out instead 
of using the regulatory tools available. 
EPA is continuing to allow new PFAS onto 
the market, some without any review under 
‘‘low volume exemptions’’ to the Toxic Sub-
stances Control Act. 
Last year, EPA issued a ‘‘PFAS Action 
Plan’’ that did not take needed action to ad-
dress cleanup of contaminated sites, set limits 
on PFAS in drinking water, or even require re-
porting of PFAS releases. 
In fact, the only commitments made in the 
action plan were to make some determinations 
by the end of 2019—commitments that were 
not met. 
H.R. 535 will provide the protections im-
pacted communities need quickly and for the 
long term. 
The PFAS Action Act of 2019 would require 
EPA to use tools under several environmental 
statutes to: 
1. Stem the flow of PFAS contamination into 
the environment by requiring cleanup of sites 
contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, setting 
air emission limits, prohibiting unsafe inciner-
ation of PFAS, and limiting the introduction of 
new PFAS chemicals into commerce; 
2. Identify health risks by requiring com-
prehensive health testing for all PFAS, report-
ing of PFAS releases, and monitoring for 
PFAS in drinking water; 
3. Limit human exposure to PFAS by requir-
ing a drinking water standard for PFAS that 
protects public health, including the health of 
vulnerable 
subpopulations 
like 
pregnant 
women, infants, and children, and holding pol-
luters accountable. 
In addition, H.R. 535 provides grants to im-
pacted water systems, creates a voluntary 
label for cookware that is PFAS free, and pro-
vides guidance for first responders to limit 
their exposures. 
Mr. Chair, H.R. 535 addresses a critical 
threat to the public health and safety and that 
is why I support and urge my colleagues to 
join me. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, may I inquire 
again about time remaining. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from 
New York has 91⁄2 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Illinois has 111⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chair, I would 
like to commend the sponsor of this 
bill, my friend from Michigan, Con-
gresswoman DINGELL. She is a true 
champion of clean air and water. 
Families across my district are right-
fully concerned about a chemical leg-
acy that they and their children will 
bear unless we pass this bill. Sampling 
of wells is ongoing in the community of 
Devens, as well as its neighbor, the 
town of Ayer. 
PFAS contamination was likely due, 
at least in part, to the firefighting 
foam used at the Fort Devens Army 
base over the past century. The town of 
Hudson has had to contend with its 
own PFAS issues, such as in its Cran-
berry Bog well. 
The EPA has failed in its duty of care 
to the American people, so I urge my 
colleagues to protect public health and 
to pass H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act. 
Clean drinking water is something to 
which everyone in this Nation is enti-
tled. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing. 
I rise in full, enthusiastic support for 
this legislation which is long overdue. 
For decades, chemical corporations 
like 3M and DuPont knowingly manu-
factured products containing forever- 
toxic chemicals known as PFAS. 
Our Federal Government has con-
firmed that PFAS can adversely affect 
growth and learning in children, lower 
a women’s chance of getting pregnant, 
increase cholesterol, hinder the im-
mune system, interfere with hormone 
regulation, and even increase the risk 
of cancer. 
As a cancer survivor myself, and as 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee Military Construction, Vet-
erans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee, I find it unconscionable 
that I have veterans coming to me to 
complain that their families are dying 
due to the Department of Defense’s 
decades-long use of these chemicals. 
As a member of the Oversight and 
Reform Committee, I have told 3M and 
DuPont to their faces that I don’t 
know how they sleep at night. They 
poisoned our water and contaminated 
the bloodstream of millions of people 
all for profit. 
It is past time that the Federal Gov-
ernment step up and do something 
about it, and we do that here today. I 
commend Congresswoman DINGELL for 
her work and so many of my colleagues 
who have fought so far and so long, in-
cluding the chairman. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Mrs. FLETCHER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
support of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action 
Act, a comprehensive bill to address 
PFAS contamination across the coun-
try. And I thank my colleagues for 
their commitment to bringing this bill 
to the floor. 
Mr. Chair, I am glad that one of the 
bills I filed in this Congress, H.R. 2638, 
has now been included in this legisla-
tion. It directs the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency to issue guidance on 
minimizing the use of firefighting foam 
and other equipment that contains 
PFAS chemicals by firefighters and 
first responders. 
Its purpose is simply to minimize the 
risk for our firefighters and first re-
sponders as well as for our environ-
ment. We know that these chemicals 
are dangerous for humans who have 
been exposed to them, and we know 
they are dangerous for our environ-
ment. 
Unfortunately, we have seen the im-
pacts in our community as recently as 
last year. During the ITC plant fire in 
Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019, fire-
fighters used more than 130,000 gallons 
of foam to extinguish the massive 
flames in that fire. Not long after, high 
levels of PFAS chemicals were found in 
the water in the Houston Ship Channel 
and lower levels were found farther 
downstream, according to the Gal-
veston Bay Foundation. 
Our first responders risk their lives 
every day to protect our communities. 
We must do everything we can to pro-
tect theirs. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H124 
January 9, 2020 
I thank the House leadership for 
bringing forward this package today. I 
want to explain why it is critical that 
Members support this bill. 
The health and the safety of commu-
nities across our great country are 
compromised 
by 
these 
dangerous 
chemicals. For their sake, let’s not pre-
tend that nibbling at the edges with 
the latest NDAA is enough to declare 
victory. 
I have visited the communities and 
met the families who are dealing with 
the fallout from PFAS exposure and 
environmental 
contamination. 
They 
elected us to put their needs first, and 
they need more than half measures. 
I appreciate my Republican col-
leagues’ willingness to work on cleanup 
of Federal facilities, but that simply is 
not enough. I cannot in good con-
science go home this weekend and tell 
the people of Rensselaer County: ‘‘We 
are cleaning up DOD sites, but we have 
no plan for the polluted industrial sites 
in Hoosick Falls, or any others like it 
around the country.’’ 
It just isn’t right. We need to take 
action under Superfund and hold PFAS 
polluters 
responsible, 
regardless 
of 
whether they are public or private. 
The bill also requires any national 
drinking water standard to, at a min-
imum, ensure vulnerable groups, in-
cluding pregnant women, infants, and 
children, are protected. 
I won’t tolerate EPA adopting an un-
safe standard, and I do hope Members 
with impacted communities won’t ei-
ther. 
The bill includes other critical provi-
sions to reduce PFAS exposure, em-
power consumers, and expedite clean-
ups. We have waited too long already 
for the administration to act. I fear we 
will keep waiting, or worse, deal with 
the consequences of unprotective ac-
tions. 
Until we enact these provisions, we 
cannot say that Congress has done its 
job. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
As we went through the TSCA de-
bate, one thing I learned was exposure 
over time of the hazard equals the risk. 
b 1915 
Sometimes, we conflate a bad chem-
ical as risk unless you can protect it 
from exposure. That is why I have been 
focusing on the 7,866 chemicals. That is 
why I am talking about the PFAS that 
might be in a hockey puck but not in 
the bloodstream. 
But this bill says that everything is 
going to be labeled as a hazardous 
waste and followed up on Superfund. 
The contrary argument is: Great, put it 
in the Superfund. When will that get 
cleaned up? 
If it is in Ellison Air Force Base, 
Alaska, 30 years, and it is still not 
cleaned up. Williams Air Force Base, 
Chandler, Arizona, 30 years, and it is 
still not cleaned up. Castle Air Force 
Base, Merced, California, 32 years, and 
it is still not cleaned up. Dover Air 
Force Base, 30 years, and it is still not 
cleaned up. Central Landfill in John-
ston, Rhode Island, 33 years, and it is 
still not cleaned up. Walsh Landfill, 
Honey Brook Township, Pennsylvania, 
Superfund site, 35 years, and it is still 
not cleaned up. Colbert, what we have 
is 35 years of litigation. 
I like that red map that they are 
touting out here on this bill. That red 
map indicates trial lawyer action in all 
those States because most of the 
Superfund money goes to litigation. 
Mr. Chairman, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illi-
nois has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I also 
want to highlight what we have done. I 
think some people have alluded to it, 
that nothing was done, but a lot was 
done in the National Defense Author-
ization Act. A little bit more was done 
in the end-of-year spending bill. This 
Safe Drinking Water Act provision 
could have been in, and we all know it. 
That could have been in law today. But 
it wasn’t, as leverage for this bill that 
we are talking about today. 
In the NDAA, we require EPA to 
mandate that drinking water systems 
monitor for unregulated PFAS. That is 
law. In the NDAA, it is now law that 
we provide grants to communities to 
address 
emerging 
contaminants 
in 
drinking water, including PFAS. 
Currently, in law, we require new re-
porting for PFAS under the Toxics Re-
lease Inventory program. Currently, 
under law, it is required that manufac-
turers and processors of PFAS submit 
health and safety information. It is 
now law. 
Current law restricts new uses of 
long-chain PFAS. Now, what do I mean 
by long chain? That is when there are 
7,866 different per- and polyfluorinated 
compounds. You have long-chain ones, 
and you have short-chain ones. We are 
banning the long chain, and again, we 
need scientific research, but this bans 
them all, whether or not they are safe. 
EPA law now is guidance for appro-
priate 
destruction. 
Now 
currently 
under law, it requires the Federal Gov-
ernment to work expeditiously with 
States to enter in a binding coopera-
tive agreement concerning cleanup. 
Mr. Chairman, that is in respect to 
your State of Michigan. Michigan es-
tablished its standard. The Department 
of Defense was hiding behind the fact 
that it couldn’t negotiate. You guys 
were 
successful. 
Former 
Chairman 
UPTON was part of that fight. I applaud 
the State of Michigan for having that 
done, and now that is current law. 
In the appropriations bill, which pro-
vided $2 billion for the Clean Water and 
Drinking State Revolving Fund, $20 
million will go to State-level PFOS 
cleanup. 
So as we hear this debate and as we 
go to the amendments, we are going to 
hear doom and gloom and that we are 
negligent, that EPA is not doing any-
thing, and that we are terrible people. 
In fact, at the end of last year, great 
strides were made, in a bipartisan man-
ner. I applaud the NDAA. I applaud the 
end-of-year spending bill. And this, too, 
shall end. 
I do want to highlight the fact that 
to 
ban 
7,866 
forms 
of 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated 
compounds 
without 
doing science, that has never been done 
in the history of this Chamber and this 
body. It is more political science 
versus science. 
We get it. We will move through this 
process. We will have our votes, and 
then this will be a fight for the next 
Congress because the Senate has said it 
is not going to support this bill. It is 
not going to bring it up. The President 
has already issued a veto threat. 
It is a good exercise. I get to practice 
speaking on the floor with my friends 
in debate, which I look forward to as 
we bring up the amendments. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chair, I am proud to 
be a cosponsor of H.R. 535—The PFAS Ac-
tion Act. This bill is a big step towards cleaner 
water for all Americans. It designates PFOA 
and PFOS as hazardous; these are two of the 
most prevalent substances that make up the 
group of substances known as PFAS. These 
‘forever’ chemicals are known to pose serious 
health concerns that have affected many of 
my constituents throughout Bucks County 
along with Americans across our country. 99 
percent of people have traces of PFAS in their 
blood. 
One of my top PFAS priorities has been 
getting a federal Maximum Contaminant Level 
(MCL) for PFAS chemicals in our water. Most 
states do not have an MCL and ones that do, 
are not uniform. State residence should not be 
the defining factor for an American to have 
safe drinking water, having one universal MCL 
for PFOA and PFOS in the U.S. helps to solve 
this problem. 
Currently there is no limit on how much 
PFAS pollution is in our water and air. This bill 
gives EPA the power to begin regulating this 
lethal pollution. It will jumpstart the cleanup ef-
fort and hold PFAS polluters accountable. It 
will require polluting companies to submit in-
formation to EPA, so that the Agency can 
more fully evaluate the environmental and 
health effects of these toxins. 
Hundreds of PFAS chemicals are used in 
commercial goods and The PFAS Action Act 
will put in place a labeling system so that 
PFAS-free products can be easily identified by 
consumers. 
I have seen firsthand the devastating health 
effects that PFAS substances cause in my 
community. 
The 
Department 
of 
Defense 
(DOD) used PFAS chemicals in its firefighting 
foam for decades at the Willow Grove base 
that contaminated the water and soil in War-
minster, PA. Last month I supported a new 
Defense bill that became law which ends the 
practice of using that specific kind of fire-
fighting foam by 2024. This bill goes further 
and will make people safer and less likely to 
consume these toxins. 
Every American deserves access to clean 
drinking water and clean air. Most of us think 
only clean water comes out of our faucets

when we turn them on, unfortunately, this is a 
misconception. Until this bill is signed into law 
and is fully implemented, we cannot trust that 
our water is not contaminated with these toxic 
substances. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. A vote for this bill means 
that you care about safe drinking water for 
your constituents. EPA has promised to ad-
dress PFAS, and this bill will ensure that they 
make substantial progress by setting firm 
deadlines. 
I would like to thank Congresswoman DIN-
GELL, Congressman UPTON along with Con-
gressman KILDEE, who co-chairs the Bipar-
tisan PFAS Taskforce with me, for their work 
in leading this important bill. 
I also want to thank Joanne Stanton and 
Hope Grosse of the Buxmont Coalition for 
Clean Water along with many of the townships 
and municipalities throughout my district, they 
have fought for years for meaningful action to 
be taken on this issue, and while this bill is by 
no measure the finish line, it is a major mile-
stone. 
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 116–45, modified by the amend-
ment printed in part A of House Report 
116–366, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as the original bill for the purpose 
of further amendment under the 5- 
minute rule and shall be considered as 
read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows:

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. WOODALL 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part 
B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 47, line 7, insert ‘‘, Federal Aviation 
Administration,’’ after ‘‘U.S. Fire Adminis-
tration’’. 
Page 47, line 8, insert ‘‘and representatives 
of State and local building and fire code en-
forcement jurisdictions’’ after ‘‘departments 
or agencies’’. 
Page 47, line 9, insert ‘‘, or contact with,’’ 
after ‘‘use of’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 779, the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. WOODALL) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I in-
troduced this amendment in partner-
ship with my friend from California 
(Mr. DESAULNIER), with whom I serve 
on the Rules Committee and with 
whom I serve on the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee. 
I have a poster here, Mr. Chairman, 
of what it looks like when the foam is 
released to prevent a fuel fire in an air-
port hangar. If you can’t tell from 
where you are sitting, this is the tail of 
the airplane being lifted up above the 
foam. 
As currently drafted, I certainly 
agree with the ranking member that 
this bill is much too expansive. But in 
this one limited case, it doesn’t go far 
enough. Our building code enforcement 
agencies locally, our local fire codes, 
require that in order to have a hangar 
permitted, it must have these fire sup-
pression systems. 
But what we found in our research, 
Mr. Chairman, is that more often than 
not, these systems go off unintention-
ally. In fact, in the last 16 years, there 
have been 174 hangar foam releases like 
this one. Only 37 of those were in re-
sponse to an actual incident. The other 
137 were accidental releases. 
If we are concerned about these toxic 
chemicals, 
certainly 
having 
them 
available for a dire firefighting need 
but released accidentally, it advan-
tages no one. In fact, even in the 37 in-
cidents that were in response to a fire 
event, none of those were in response 
to the fuel fire event that the building 
code requires these systems be in-
stalled to suppress. 
What 
my 
amendment 
does, 
Mr. 
Chairman, in partnership with Mr. 
DESAULNIER, is to say that when we are 
having these conversations about how 
to restrict the use of these foams, we 
need to have the FAA present in those 
conversations, and we need to have the 
local enforcement authorities for fire 
and building code safety present in 
those conversations to prevent these 
types of releases, again, that advantage 
no one. 
It is an opportunity to take what is a 
very well-intended effort to reduce the 
use of these chemicals and reduce it 
even further. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I do not intend to op-
pose the amendment. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the 
gentleman from New York is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment builds on an important 
piece of this bill, the guidance for fire-
fighters and other first responders to 
minimize their risk from PFAS chemi-
cals. This provision was developed by 
Representative LIZZIE FLETCHER, and I 
thank her for her leadership on ad-
dressing this important concern. 
Our first responders take enormous 
risks every day for the greater good. 
Cancer from occupational exposure 
should not be among those risks. Un-
fortunately, occupational-related can-
cers now account for 65 percent of the 
line-of-duty deaths for firefighters each 
year. 
Last year, Pat Morrison of the Inter-
national Association of Fire Fighters 
testified before my subcommittee on 
the impacts PFAS in firefighting gear 
have had on firefighters. This is the 
single largest health-related issue fac-
ing the firefighting profession. 
I thank Representative FLETCHER for 
her work in protecting firefighters, and 
I also thank the gentlemen from Geor-
gia and California for their efforts on 
this important topic. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to 
support 
the 
Woodall-DeSaulnier 
amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
KHANNA). 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
strong support of the PFAS Action 
Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H128 
January 9, 2020 
The facts are that the industry, the 
Pentagon, and the EPA knew that 
PFAS are hazardous to health, yet we 
did not do anything as a Congress until 
Representative DINGELL had the cour-
age to lead this act to get a bipartisan 
group together. I salute Representative 
DINGELL for her leadership. 
I am proud to have sponsored the 
PFAS waste incineration act. The 
marked-up bill is included in the pack-
age. The provision requires the EPA to 
ensure all incineration of PFAS waste 
is done properly. 
I thank Chairman TONKO and Chair-
man PALLONE for their leadership on 
this issue and also the ranking mem-
bers for at least their work on the in-
cineration part of PFAS and making 
sure that the waste is marked ‘‘haz-
ardous.’’ 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Chair, may I 
ask how much time I have remaining. 
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). The gentleman from Georgia has 
21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SHIMKUS), who is the ranking 
minority member. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I, too, 
rise in support of this amendment. 
It is my understanding this amends 
section 18 to ensure the FAA, State and 
local building code inspectors, and fire 
marshals are at the guidance-making 
table. I understand the officers believe 
this will result in a broader collabo-
rative dialogue that includes the risks 
posed by the use of foam suppression 
systems in aviation hangars. That 
would be helpful. I understand that, in 
aircraft hangars, foam systems are not 
being used by first responders pursuant 
to Federal regulations. 
I have one question for the sponsor of 
the amendment about his intent with 
regard to one item. Is this amendment 
intended to open a dialogue about 
human health impacts or standards, or 
personal protective equipment require-
ments, responses, protocols, or any-
thing like that? 
Mr. WOODALL. I thank the gen-
tleman for his question. Absolutely 
not. What the amendment does is it 
has language, Madam Chair, that in-
serts the words ‘‘or contact with’’ to 
make that point that firefighters are 
not using the foam; they are respond-
ing after the foam has already been 
used. 
As Mr. SHIMKUS knows, when they 
come in contact with the foam in the 
course of their duties, it is our intent 
to lower the probability of any release 
of toxic foam on airfields. As I said, 
most of these releases are accidental 
releases. By bringing the building code 
inspectors to the table, we believe that 
we can reduce all instances of release 
without opening the dialogue on the 
topics about which he inquired. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague 
for the explanation. 
I also would highlight that under this 
bill, airports are exempt from the 
Superfund liability. It does pose a ques-
tion of who cleans up the composed 
contamination on airports if we are 
going to protect airports from the li-
ability. I guess airports went out; other 
communities do not. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Chair, I will 
close by saying we may disagree about, 
again, the breadth of the overall legis-
lation, but as it comes to this indi-
vidual line-item, we are talking pri-
marily about accidental releases of a 
very important firefighting foam but 
one that we know we want to reduce 
the usage of, the bipartisan partnership 
that we have created with the support 
of the chairman and ranking member. I 
am grateful to them for their leader-
ship and support. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1930 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I remind 
everyone that PFOS/PFOA are dan-
gerous contaminants that threaten in-
dividual lives and our communities, as 
our firefighters have pointed out, in 
various, various dimensions. 
Madam Chair, I rise to support the 
amendment and the overall bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. BURGESS 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike section 2. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, this 
amendment would strike section 2 of 
H.R. 535. 
Section 2 of H.R. 535 requires the En-
vironmental Protection Agency to des-
ignate the chemicals PFOA and PFOS 
as hazardous substances under the 
Comprehensive 
Environmental 
Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability 
Act, also known as the Superfund, and 
to do this within 1 year of enactment, 
and requires a review of the entire 
PFAS chemical group within 5 years. 
I believe this to be flawed for several 
reasons: 
First and foremost, the Environ-
mental Protection Agency is already 
undergoing a thorough examination of 
the chemicals known as PFAS. Section 
2 circumvents the regulatory process 
and would deny any public notice, any 
public comment, or any scientific 
study before deeming PFOA and PFOS 
as 
hazardous 
chemicals 
under 
the 
Superfund. 
Any substance designated as a haz-
ardous substance under CERCLA at-
taches strict, joint and several, and 
retroactive liability conditions. If you 
had any stake in the production, any 
stake in the ownership or cleanup of 
such a substance, that party might be 
liable under the Superfund law. The 
public has a right to comment on the 
impacts of such an important measure. 
Second, section 2 is simply imprac-
tical. In the 40 years since the passage 
of the Superfund bill, Congress has 
never specifically placed individual 
chemicals or chemical groups into 
statute as hazardous chemicals under 
this act. 
In those 40 years, 800 chemicals have 
been added to this list through the reg-
ulatory process. The Environmental 
Protection Agency is currently aware 
of between 5,000 and possibly as many 
as 7,800 PFAS chemicals. The problem 
is we don’t know how many exist. The 
EPA would not be able to properly 
evaluate the thousands of chemicals 
that make up the PFAS in only 5 
years. 
PFAS chemicals must be properly as-
sessed with the best science possible. 
As currently written, section 2 of the 
legislation denies the EPA the ability 
to properly and thoroughly evaluate 
these chemicals and shuts out the pub-
lic from commenting on the regulatory 
impacts, including the potential future 
development of safer PFAS chemicals. 
Madam Chair, for these reasons, I 
urge support of the amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
TONKO. 
Madam 
Chair, 
this 
amendment would strike the Superfund 
provision from this bill completely. It 
will significantly weaken this bill and 
leave hundreds of impacted commu-
nities in harm’s way. 
What does the Superfund provision in 
this bill do exactly? H.R. 535 lists only 
PFOA and PFOS under Superfund and 
leaves decisions for all other PFAS to 
EPA. 
EPA has already committed to list-
ing PFOA and PFOS under Superfund 
and has been working on the listings 
since 2018. So this bill does not pre-
judge EPA decisions. EPA has already 
made those decisions. 
The bill will speed up that listing so 
that cleanup of existing contamination 
starts sooner, which is critical. It also 
sets up a reasonable deadline for EPA 
to make decisions on other PFAS 
chemicals under Superfund to speed up 
any additional needed cleanups. 
Superfund cleanups are essential to 
public health, and for impacted com-
munities, they can be the difference be-
tween health and sickness, between life 
and death. 
The question before Members on this 
amendment is whether cleanups of 
PFOA and PFOS should start right 
away or whether impacted commu-
nities can continue to wait.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H129 
January 9, 2020 
While EPA drags its feet, people in 
hundreds 
of 
impacted 
communities 
across the country will continue to be 
exposed and continue to be harmed. 
Pollution will spread from these sites 
into the environment, into sources of 
drinking water, and into our agricul-
tural resources. And eventual cleanups 
will become harder and more costly. 
Madam Chair, impacted communities 
cannot afford to wait. I urge my col-
leagues, therefore, to vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding and for offering such an im-
portant amendment. 
Madam Chair, I agree that section 2 
of the underlying bill presents a grave 
problem. 
PFAS were first used in the 1940s and 
continued to be used in a variety of ev-
eryday objects, including pizza boxes, 
food 
wrappers, 
nonstick 
cookware, 
stain-resistant furniture, water-resist-
ant clothes, firefighters’ protective 
suits, and medical devices. 
I support this amendment because it 
would prevent so many important ma-
terials from being labeled as hazardous 
without the scientific proof to back it 
up. We should not label all 5,000 of 
these materials the same way. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the amendment. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, PFAS chemicals must 
be properly assessed with the best 
science possible. As currently written, 
section 2 of this legislation denies the 
EPA the ability to properly and thor-
oughly evaluate these chemicals. We 
are literally making the perfect the 
enemy of the good. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
for yielding. 
Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to the gentleman’s amendment. 
Superfund is a landmark environ-
mental law and an essential public 
health program that works. 
There are contaminated sites all 
across this country that pose direct 
threats to human health and the envi-
ronment because of pollutants like 
lead, mercury, PCBs, and asbestos. 
Superfund is the program that gets 
those sites cleaned up. 
Superfund does not regulate the use 
of chemicals; it does not block the use 
of chemicals; and it does not assign li-
ability for the use of chemicals. It only 
applies to the release of chemicals into 
the environment. 
Some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have characterized 
Superfund as a de facto ban. They say 
that the industry will so fear liability 
that they will abandon PFAS chemi-
cals. 
Experience shows that that simply is 
not true. There are hundreds of chemi-
cals listed under Superfund that con-
tinue to be used in industrial and con-
sumer products and by the Department 
of Defense. In fact, Superfund is de-
signed to prevent releases of chemicals 
that are in continued use. 
When a chemical is listed as a haz-
ardous air pollutant under the Clean 
Air Act, EPA sets emission limits for 
that chemical that are implemented 
through permits. Facilities continue to 
use and emit those chemicals. At the 
same time, those chemicals are auto-
matically listed under Superfund. The 
same is true under the Clean Water 
Act. 
Madam Chair, the funny thing is that 
the two PFAS compounds covered by 
this bill, PFOA and PFOS, have al-
ready been phased out for more than a 
decade under a voluntary partnership 
between EPA and industry. 
We have heard many concerns from 
my Republican friends about the spec-
ter of Superfund liability for different 
groups. These concerns are largely un-
founded. 
Drinking water utilities will handle 
PFOA and PFOS the same way they 
handle the hundreds of hazardous sub-
stances they currently remove from 
drinking water. The same will be true 
for wastewater utilities. 
Farmers will continue to be able to 
use biosolids as fertilizer, just as they 
currently do, because Superfund al-
ready exempts fertilizer use. Manufac-
turers of airplane door seals and heart 
stents will be able to continue using 
the PFAS they currently use—all while 
impacted communities, like Michigan, 
will get the cleanup that they need. 
The only change this bill makes in 
how Superfund operates is a limited ex-
emption for federally required use of 
PFAS at airports. If this amendment 
were adopted, airports would lose that 
exemption. And if EPA eventually 
moves forward with listing PFOA and 
PFAS, as they have committed to do, 
EPA is not authorized to exempt air-
ports. Only Congress can do that. So 
the airports need this amendment de-
feated, and they need this bill enacted. 
A Superfund listing is an essential 
provision to accelerate PFAS cleanup 
nationwide. It is the foundation of the 
PFAS Action Act. By gutting it, we 
cripple our ability to serve and protect 
the American people responsibly. 
Madam Chair, I join my colleague, 
the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Environment and Climate Change, in 
urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Texas will be post-
poned. 
The Chair is advised that amendment 
No. 3 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. HUDSON 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 19. INVESTIGATION OF PREVENTION OF 
CONTAMINATION BY GENX. 
The Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall investigate methods 
and means to prevent contamination by 
GenX of surface waters, including source 
waters used for drinking water purposes. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I rise 
today to offer my first amendment to 
H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act. 
For the last several years, my con-
stituents and neighboring communities 
in North Carolina have dealt with con-
tamination from the PFAS chemical 
GenX. The company Chemours has 
been discharging this chemical into the 
air as well as the waters of the Cape 
Fear River, a common source of drink-
ing water. 
To put it simply, my constituents are 
scared. They are frustrated because 
this has been an ongoing issue, and 
they don’t have enough information. 
This is an issue that I have been 
working on for many years. I have de-
manded action by EPA, and I had the 
EPA come to Fayetteville and hear di-
rectly from our community. 
At 
our 
community 
engagement 
event, hundreds of people attended, and 
many shared their concerns with the 
potential links between GenX and seri-
ous health problems. 
I worked with our chairman to have 
an Energy and Commerce hearing, and 
we invited Emily Donovan, a founding 
member of Clean Cape Fear in North 
Carolina, to testify. Emily gave com-
pelling testimony about her personal 
experiences and the many people who 
have ‘‘suffered from the trauma of can-
cer treatments, benign tumors, and 
terminal diagnosis.’’ 
I have talked with many of my con-
stituents, including one whose neigh-
bor has cancer, and they don’t know if 
it is connected to GenX. They can’t get 
information about it, and they are wor-
ried about their own children. 
This is about getting answers for our 
community. This is about making sure

my constituents are protected and the 
water we are drinking is safe. 
Until I know the science behind 
GenX, until I know exactly what safe 
levels and unsafe levels of exposure 
are, until we can adequately clean up 
the exposure we have had in North 
Carolina, I am not going to be satis-
fied. 
I have a letter here from Secretary 
Michael Regan of the North Carolina 
Department of Environmental Quality 
supporting this effort. 
Madam Chair, I include that letter in 
the RECORD. 
NORTH CAROLINA 
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, 
Raleigh, NC, January 9, 2020. 
Hon. RICHARD HUDSON, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
HUDSON: As you 
know North Carolina has been at the fore-
front in dealing with the issue of emerging 
compounds. Because of the lack of guidance 
or action from the current U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), our 
state and others have taken the lead on the 
necessary investigations, scientific evalua-
tions, remediation and enforcement actions 
for PFAS contamination caused by govern-
ment and industrial uses. 
It is clear that members of Congress, on 
both sides of the aisle, understand the urgent 
need to immediately address the contamina-
tion from PFAS chemicals, especially in 
North Carolina. The North Carolina Depart-
ment of Environmental Quality appreciates 
the leadership you and the state’s delegation 
are providing to advance the conversation 
surrounding PFAS and GenX as we continue 
in our mission to protect our state’s water 
and air. 
I look forward to continued dialogue with 
you and your colleagues to encourage the 
U.S. EPA to move more quickly to set PFAS 
health standards and protections. I hope that 
we can count on you and the entire delega-
tion to push for much-needed resources and 
support to address current and future con-
tamination and remediation needs involving 
these forever chemicals. 
Sincerely, 
MICHAEL S. REGAN, 
Secretary, North Carolina 
Department of Environmental Quality. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, while I 
understand it takes time to develop the 
scientific evidence to make these deci-
sions, my neighbors are tired of wait-
ing. We must act now. 
My amendment adopts this common-
sense approach and requires the EPA 
to investigate methods and means to 
prevent contamination by GenX of sur-
face waters, including source waters 
used for drinking purposes. This will 
enable us to find the best ways possible 
to safeguard our waters both now and 
for future generations. 
Madam Chair, I thank Chairman 
PALLONE, Ranking Member WALDEN, 
Chairman TONKO, Ranking Member 
SHIMKUS, and my good friend and col-
league Mr. DAVID ROUZER all for work-
ing with me on this, and I urge the rest 
of my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1945 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition, though I do not 
plan to oppose this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from New York is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, GenX is a 
group of PFAS chemicals that have 
been a particular concern for several 
communities. Last year, the Energy 
and Commerce Committee heard testi-
mony from a member of one of those 
communities, Emily Donovan, of the 
group Clean Cape Fear. 
Emily testified about the burden of 
disease in her community, including 
her husband’s cancer, and the burden of 
having to educate and protect her com-
munity without the protections and re-
sources of our Federal environmental 
laws. 
Her group, Clean Cape Fear, had to 
seek donations to install drinking 
water treatment for the public schools 
of her town so that the children could 
have safe water to drink at school. 
That is just not right. 
So I appreciate these North Carolina 
Members raising the issue of GenX to 
help Emily and other people impacted 
by GenX. I thank the gentlemen for 
their amendment, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
this bill. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS), the 
ranking member of the committee. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, my col-
league, Mr. HUDSON, has led the com-
mittee’s efforts to address GenX on be-
half of his constituents in North Caro-
lina. He has pressed EPA to complete 
its human health toxicity assessment 
on GenX using science. 
This amendment takes the next step 
to focus EPA on ways to keep people’s 
drinking water safe under GenX. This 
is a prudent step to harness the tech-
nical expertise of the EPA to identify 
ways to reduce contamination of the 
substance, which will be useful in con-
nection with EPA’s other work and 
will aim to stop future problems like 
those in Cape Fear River. I applaud my 
colleague and friend for his work. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I have 
no further speakers. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I support 
the Hudson amendment, and I encour-
age my colleagues to do likewise. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUD-
SON). 
The amendment was agreed to.

part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I have

a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I rise 
today to offer my second amendment 
to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 
2019. 
As I have just described, the chem-
ical GenX has been a major concern for 
my constituents for years. 
As I have already stated, my con-
stituents are scared, and they don’t 
know what the long-term health effects 
of being exposed to these chemicals 
will be. 
Madam Chair, we cannot wait to 
begin the cleanup of drinking waters 
that have been affected by these 
chemicals. While this bill is far from 
perfect, I am encouraged that it does 
create a PFAS Infrastructure Grant 
Program to provide assistance to com-
munity water systems affected by 
PFAS. 
My amendment would simply clarify 
that communities like mine that have 
been impacted by GenX are eligible for 
grants under this section. It would not 
affect the program in any way, other 
than providing clarity and relief to the 
people of North Carolina. 
I know that we still have a lot of 
work to do to solve the PFAS issue. I 
am committed to working with all 
Members of Congress, Republicans and 
Democrats, as well as State and local 
leaders to make sure we are taking 
care of our communities. Everyone de-
serves clean water. 
Today, we are taking a positive step, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
work on this issue. I would urge all of 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, though I do not intend to oppose 
it. 
The Acting CHAIR (Miss RICE of New 
York). Without objection, the gen-
tleman from New York is recognized

There was no objection. 
Mr. 
TONKO. 
Madam 
Chair, 
this 
amendment explicitly includes GenX 
chemicals in the definition of PFAS 
covered by the legislation. 
I want to be clear that GenX are 
PFAS chemicals and are already cov-
ered by this provision, regardless of 
whether this amendment is adopted. 
I am happy to support, however, the 
amendment 
because 
we 
absolutely 
mean for this funding to be available to 
remove GenX from drinking water. But

January 9, 2020 
no one should interpret this amend-
ment as implying that GenX are not al-
ready covered within the definition of 
PFAS. 
I also want to mention one important 
thing about GenX. We have heard a lot 
today about how PFOA and PFAS are 
dangerous, but that newer PFAS might 
be safer. I want to make certain that 
everyone understands, GenX is one of 
those supposedly safer alternatives. It 
is a set of short-chain PFAS that were 
developed to replace PFOA. 
GenX is a great example of why we 
need the moratorium on new PFAS in-
cluded in this bill, because if EPA had 
the needed science in hand when GenX 
was introduced, communities in North 
Carolina, and nationwide, might never 
have been impacted. 
That is what we are trying to accom-
plish with this bill. We want to help 
the communities that have been im-
pacted and head off future harmful pol-
lution. 
I thank the gentlemen for their 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment and this 
bill. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Chair, I just 
want to say thank you to Chairman 
TONKO for working with me on this 
very important issue. 
Again, folks back home in North 
Carolina are very concerned, to put it 
mildly. And so to give them a little bit 
of clarity, a little bit of certainty that 
GenX is covered means a lot to folks 
back home, so I appreciate the gen-
tleman working with me on this. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate the kind words from the gen-
tleman from North Carolina. I appre-
ciate working with him. I encourage 
my colleagues to support the Hudson 
amendment, his second amendment, 
and I will do likewise. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUD-
SON). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. BALDERSON 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 19. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act shall not take effect until the date 
that the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency certifies that the 
Environmental Protection Agency has com-
pleted the actions described in the document 
titled ‘‘EPA’s Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Sub-
stances (PFAS) Action Plan’’ and dated Feb-
ruary, 2019. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Chair, my 
amendment would require the EPA ad-
ministrator to certify to Congress the 
agency has completed its own PFAS 
Action Plan before the underlying bill 
may be implemented. 
My amendment acknowledges the 
concern for human health and the envi-
ronment caused by drinking water con-
tamination and enables the EPA, the 
appropriate regulatory agency, to im-
prove the situation through careful 
science. 
PFAS are synthetic chemicals used 
in a variety of products that have com-
mercial, industrial, and military uses. 
These substances are often found in ev-
eryday objects and relied upon by 
Americans. 
One of the most important uses is 
medical devices. PFAS materials are 
central components of many medical 
devices because they are bio-compat-
ible, durable, and deemed safe for im-
plantation when necessary. 
PFAS, and, in fact, fluoropolymers, 
have lifesaving applications in medical 
devices, including heart patches and 
grafts, stents, and surgical mesh. They 
are found in catheters and other med-
ical tubing and guide wires used in sur-
gical patients and to treat thousands of 
diseases. These substances are even 
found in sterile coatings on hospital 
gowns, masks, and other tools needed 
to keep hospital settings sterile and 
fight infections. 
In my district of Ohio 12, medical de-
vice producers make these critical 
products and contribute to improving 
patients’ lives every day. 
Clearly, not all PFAS are the same. 
To assert that all these 5,000-plus sub-
stances are hazardous in one move is 
not based on science and it is dan-
gerous. That would call into question 
the already approved medical devices 
that are saving lives. 
The better solution is to allow the 
EPA to do its work and look at each 
chemical on its own merits, rather 
than labeling the whole diverse class as 
hazardous. 
I agree with the authors of this bill 
that we must be cautious with the use 
of chemicals and reduce their levels in 
our water supplies, but this cannot be 
done at the jeopardy of American pa-
tients. 
That is why I am thrilled to learn 
about EPA’s PFAS Action Plan, which 
the agency published last year in re-
sponse to greater awareness of this 
issue and rising public health concerns. 
As part of this plan, the EPA works 
with Federal, State, and local partners 
to understand and act on known PFAS 
dangers. 
The EPA plan is a comprehensive, 
cross-agency approach. It includes con-
crete steps to monitor, detect, and ad-
dress PFAS contamination. 
One major action worth noting that 
the EPA has already taken is the De-
cember 3 proposal to establish a max-
imum contaminant level. This impor-
tant step toward public safety is cur-
rently under interagency review. 
For the well-being of all Americans, 
we should support this plan’s success. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This amendment would block imple-
mentation of the important public 
health protections in this bill until the 
EPA administrator certifies that its 
PFAS Action Plan is completed. 
Let’s be clear about something. This 
EPA is never going to complete that 
action plan. EPA has already failed to 
meet the weak deadlines it set for 
itself in that. 
We were supposed to have a regu-
latory determination for PFOA and 
PFAS in drinking water. We do not. We 
were supposed to have designations of 
PFOA and PFAS under Superfund. In 
fact, in EPA’s action plan they note 
that they started that activity in 2018. 
They haven’t gotten it done. 
We were supposed to have EPA ac-
tion to require reporting of PFAS re-
leases on the Toxics Release Inventory. 
We had to attach that to the NDAA to 
get it done. 
And, by the way, Republicans sup-
ported taking that action on NDAA. 
But even these specifics are giving 
this amendment too much credit. This 
is not a serious amendment because 
EPA’s Action Plan is not designed to 
ever be completed. Many of the action 
items are characterized by the EPA 
itself as ongoing commitments. 
Here is an example. EPA committed 
to holding responsible parties account-
able for PFAS releases into the envi-
ronment. That task is an ongoing com-
mitment that can never be completed. 
Evaluating new science, evaluating 
new PFAS, assessing new drinking 
water treatment technology, these are 
all things EPA will continue doing in-
definitely. 
In fact, one of the stated purposes of 
EPA’s action plan is ‘‘preventing fu-
ture contamination.’’ When will EPA 
ever be done preventing future con-
tamination? 
So this amendment would actually 
block the important provisions in this 
bill from ever being implemented. It 
would harm public health and leave our 
communities worse off. I urge all of my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Chair, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing and for the opportunity to support 
this amendment to this deeply-flawed 
bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H132 
January 9, 2020 
Madam Chair, I rise this evening in 
support of the Balderson amendment. 
H.R. 535 will have broad and significant 
impact on medical innovation and neg-
atively impact patient outcomes. 
PFAS materials have a variety of 
uses in healthcare, ranging from car-
diac stents to the coating on contact 
lenses. Using innovative PFAS mate-
rials, surgeries such as those that were 
previously used to repair a child’s con-
genital heart defect now no longer re-
quire risky, open heart surgery proce-
dures and can simply be done as an 
outpatient 
with 
significantly 
less 
risks. 
b 2000 
The EPA is already working on its 
own comprehensive PFAS Action Plan, 
and we must listen to science rather 
than regulating new devices and treat-
ments out of existence. 
Here is the bottom line: We cannot 
ignore the benefits that some PFAS 
chemicals have given to humankind. 
Madam Chair, I strongly urge the 
adoption of the Balderson amendment. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Chair, the 
administration has demonstrated that 
one of its top priorities is the research 
and necessary regulation of PFAS. Its 
ongoing commitment to public safety 
is responsible. Congress should allow 
the EPA to complete its work before 
casting such a wide net on labeling 
5,000-plus PFAS as hazardous. This is 
an opportunity for Congress to be 
proactive rather than reactive. 
I invite Members to join me in sup-
porting thoughtful action to ensure the 
safety of the American public and our 
environment. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
my amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Ohio will be post-
poned. 
AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. DELGADO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. ll. DISCLOSURE OF INTRODUCTIONS OF 
PFAS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The introduction of any 
perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substance 
by the owner or operator of an industrial 
source shall be unlawful unless such owner 
or operator first notifies the owner or oper-
ator of the applicable treatment works of— 
(1) the identity and quantity of such sub-
stance; 
(2) whether such substance is susceptible 
to treatment by such treatment works; and 
(3) whether such substance would interfere 
with the operation of the treatment works. 
(b) VIOLATIONS.—A violation of this section 
shall be treated in the same manner as a vio-
lation of a regulation promulgated under 
subsection 307(b) of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1317(b)). 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) INTRODUCTION.—The term ‘‘introduc-
tion’’ means the introduction of pollutants 
into treatment works, as described in section 
307(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act (33 U.S.C. 1317). 
(2) TREATMENT
WORKS.—The term ‘‘treat-
ment works’’ has the meaning given that 
term in section 212 of the Federal Water Pol-
lution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1292). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. DELGADO) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, today, 
I am pleased to offer this bipartisan 
amendment to strengthen this legisla-
tion aimed at addressing PFAS con-
tamination in our communities. 
Right now, communities in upstate 
New York continue to struggle with 
the impacts of PFAS contamination in 
drinking water. Residents of Hoosick 
Falls and Petersburg in Rensselaer 
County are living every day with the 
impacts of PFAS contamination, which 
we know include thyroid disease, birth 
defects, autoimmune disorders, and 
cancer. 
Last year, Emily Marpe, who now 
lives with her family in Hoosick Falls, 
testified before the Energy and Com-
merce Committee about her experi-
ences with contaminated water in her 
home in Petersburg, New York. Emily 
spoke about her experiences of being 
unable to drink the water from her fau-
cet and having to sell her home and 
then test her blood as well as the blood 
of her children for PFOA. 
What Emily described is all too com-
mon in my district, and it is represent-
ative of the experiences of commu-
nities across the country. This is why 
PFAS has been a priority of mine and 
so many in this Chamber on both sides 
of the aisle. 
The PFAS Action Act is a critically 
important bill. My bipartisan amend-
ment will strengthen this legislation 
and address another element of this 
crisis: indirect discharge. My amend-
ment, which pulls from the PFAS 
Transparency Act, would make it ille-
gal for an industrial facility to intro-
duce PFAS into a sewage treatment 
system without first disclosing infor-
mation about that substance. 
Right now, companies can tap into a 
public wastewater infrastructure and 
introduce PFAS into our sewage sys-
tems, regardless of the local treatment 
plant’s ability to effectively treat the 
contamination. 
Most 
municipal 
water 
treatment 
plants are not equipped to effectively 
treat for PFAS contamination, which 
makes indirect discharges extremely 
hazardous, particularly when not dis-
closed. 
The PFAS Transparency Act estab-
lishes 
a 
commonsense 
requirement 
that industrial facilities disclose this 
information to treatment systems be-
forehand, meaning more transparency 
and accountability for our commu-
nities. 
I would like to take this moment to 
recognize my coleads on this measure, 
Representatives 
CHRIS
PAPPAS
and 
HARLEY
ROUDA. We introduced this 
PFAS Transparency Act alongside the 
bipartisan Clean Water Standards for 
PFAS Act of 2020, which would require 
the EPA to review PFAS discharges 
under the Clean Water Act and issue 
regulations to address harmful dis-
charges of PFAS into our Nation’s wa-
terways. 
These bills together take important 
steps to increase our understanding of 
PFAS in wastewater and address harm-
ful discharges in our water system, 
both direct and indirect. 
I urge this House to stand with our 
communities facing unthinkable con-
sequences 
of 
PFAS 
contamination. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from New York has 2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Under the Clean Water Act, many in-
dustries discharge directly to munic-
ipal sewage treatment plants rather 
than discharge directly to surface 
waters. To address this practice, the 
Clean 
Water 
Act 
established 
a 
pretreatment program, which allows 
sewage treatment plants to work with 
industrial discharge connections to en-
sure that any industrial chemicals are 
properly treated or that these chemi-
cals do not disrupt the normal func-
tioning of the sewage treatment plants. 
However, a pretreatment program is 
only effective if the sewage treatment 
plant knows which chemicals are being 
introduced into their sewage treatment 
systems. Yet, there is no current Clean 
Water Act requirement that requires 
industrial discharges to tell the mu-
nicipality that it plans to release 
PFAS-related chemicals into the sew-
age system. 
This amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO) 
would address this current loophole. I 
support this amendment, and I appre-
ciate the good work that the gen-
tleman from New York has done not

only for the residents of his congres-
sional district but for the residents of 
this country. This is an important 
amendment. I appreciate the hard work 
he has done and the sensitivity he has 
shown. 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chairwoman, 
I am prepared to close, and I want to 
use this opportunity to strengthen our 
defenses against these dangerous ‘‘for-
ever chemicals’’ and protect our drink-
ing water for generations to come. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this important bipartisan amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chairwoman, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
This amendment makes it illegal for 
an industrial facility to introduce 
PFAS into a sewage treatment system 
without first disclosing information 
about that substance. This amendment 
effectively would create an entirely 
new and duplicative regulatory pro-
gram under the Clean Water Act. 
This amendment is an ad hoc at-
tempt at regulating PFAS without any 
consideration of whether or how these 
requirements would duplicate or mesh 
with the implementation of the EPA 
PFAS Action Plan or similar, already 
existing regulatory requirements under 
the Clean Water Act. 
The committee of jurisdiction for 
this provision is the Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee, 
and 
they have held no hearings and con-
ducted no stakeholder or scientific 
community engagement or consulta-
tion on this issue. As a result, this 
amendment is nothing more than an 
automatic reaction to regulate in a 
vacuum without risk information and 
without an understanding of its con-
sequences. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MS. PINGREE 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman 
from Maine (Ms. PINGREE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Maine. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank Chairman PALLONE and Con-
gresswoman DINGELL for their leader-
ship on PFAS issues, and I thank Con-
gresswoman SPANBERGER, who is also a 
sponsor of this amendment with me. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act 
of 2019. This bipartisan bill would take 
much-needed and long-overdue action 
on these forever harmful chemicals. 
These 
pervasive 
and 
dangerous 
chemicals pose serious risks to both 
human health and to our environment, 
and the delay in taking action on them 
has been inexcusable. They are known 
hormone disruptors, and studies link 
exposure to them to kidney and testic-
ular cancer, thyroid disease, and other 
health problems. 
PFAS chemicals are concentrated in 
human and animal blood and tissue and 
can remain there for years. It is esti-
mated that 99 percent of Americans 
have PFAS in their blood. 
In my home State of Maine, PFAS 
was first discovered from the ground-
water at former military installations 
from firefighting foam, but PFAS has 
also been found in our public water 
supplies, soil, animal products, and 
household products like cookware and 
carpets. 
A 2015 review by the Environmental 
Working Group showed the majority of 
PFAS in homes comes from its pres-
ence in carpets and textiles. The U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control named car-
pet as the number one source of PFAS 
exposure for infants and toddlers, who, 
as you can imagine, spend a lot of time 
playing, lying, and crawling on carpets. 
My amendment would expand the En-
vironmental Protection Agency’s Safer 
Choice label to additional household 
products, including carpet, rugs, cloth-
ing, or upholstered furniture certified 
not to contain PFAS. This change 
would prompt manufacturers to de-
velop safer alternatives and help con-
sumers find and buy healthier products 
for their homes. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
taking action for the health of our 
communities and the environment and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute of my time to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Maine for yield-
ing. 
I support the Pingree-Spanberger 
amendment, which would expand the 
voluntary label for PFAS-free products 
to include carpets, rugs, clothing, and 
upholstered furniture. 
The PFAS-free label created under 
this bill was developed by Representa-
tive SOTO to help consumers who are 
trying to protect themselves from 
PFAS risks. I thank Mr. SOTO for his 
work on that provision. 
Expanding that label to cover car-
peting, rugs, clothing, and upholstered 
furniture makes great sense. Recent 
data suggests that those consumer 
products can be a significant source of 
PFAS exposure and that PFAS-free 
products are available on the market. 
Currently, consumers have no clear 
way to know which rugs have PFAS 
and which do not. 
Manufacturers that are taking steps 
to produce these items without PFAS 
have no way of distinguishing their 
products in the marketplace. This 
amendment will give them that tool. 
I congratulate both Representatives 
PINGREE and SPANBERGER for their sen-
sitivity to consumers by placing this 
amendment before us. I urge my col-
leagues to support the amendment and 
the overall bill. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, con-
sumers have the right to know what 
harmful chemicals are in their homes, 
and they should have the ability to 
choose products that keep their fami-
lies and their environment safe. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
b 2015 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, this amendment ex-
pands EPA’s Safer Choice program to 
include carpets, rugs, clothing, and up-
holstered furniture that do not contain 
PFAS. 
The Safer Choice program was not 
meant to cover products like this, and 
it will be extremely expensive and 
time-consuming to do so. Revisions to 
the program of this type are not con-
sistent with the intent of the program 
and would require significant changes 
to the program to implement it effec-
tively. 
To establish this standard, EPA 
would have to hold listening sessions 
and propose and finalize changes to the 
Safer Choice standard. Public involve-
ment would have to be substantial. 
Most importantly, for consumers’ in-
formation, labeling indicating the ab-
sence of PFAS does not necessarily 
mean a safer product, which under-
mines the purpose of the EPA program. 
In addition, when bisphenol A, com-
monly known as BPA, was used in baby 
bottles, companies and retailers who 
made bottles with other substances had 
no problem labeling their products as 
BPA-free. 
In some ways, this is a taxpayer- 
funded advertising campaign for cor-
porations that can cut commercials for 
their products themselves. 
In some ways, the Federal Govern-
ment needs to get into this area. A bet-
ter way would be to have a collabo-
rative among the EPA, the Consumer

At the end, add the following section: 
SEC. 19. HOUSEHOLD WELL WATER TESTING 
WEBSITE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency shall establish a website con-
taining information relating to the testing 
of household well water. 
(b) CONTENTS.—The Administrator shall in-
clude on the website established under sub-
section (a) the following: 
(1) Information on how to get groundwater 
that is the source for a household water well 
tested by a well inspector who is certified by 
a qualified third party. 
(2) A list of laboratories that analyze water 
samples and are certified by a State or the 
Administrator. 
(3) State-specific information, developed in 
coordination with each State, on naturally 
occurring and human-induced contaminants. 
(4) Information that, using accepted risk 
communication techniques, clearly commu-
nicates whether a test result value exceeds a 
level determined by the Administrator or the 
State to pose a health risk. 
(5) Information on treatment options, in-
cluding information relating to water treat-
ment systems certified by the National 
Science Foundation or the American Na-
tional Standards Institute, and people who 
are qualified to install such systems. 
(6) A directory of whom to contact to re-
port a test result value that exceeds a level 
determined by the Administrator or the 
State to pose a health risk. 
(7) Information on financial assistance 
that is available for homeowners to support 
water treatment, including grants under sec-
tion 306E of the Consolidated Farm and 
Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926e) and 
State resources. 
(8) Any other information the Adminis-
trator considers appropriate. 
(c) 
COORDINATION.—The 
Administrator 
shall coordinate with the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and appropriate State agencies 
in carrying out this section. 
(d) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
There is authorized to be appropriated to 
carry out this section $1,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2021. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
One 
community 
I 
represent 
is 
Oscoda, a small town in the northern 
part of my district. It was once the 
home of the Wurtsmith Air Force Base. 
Even though that base closed more 
than two decades ago, the Oscoda com-
munity is now dealing with PFAS con-
tamination from the base that is leach-
ing into their drinking water and the 
nearby lakes. 
For years, I have been fighting to 
help the people of Oscoda clean up 
PFAS contamination. 
In January of last year, 1 year ago, I, 
along 
with 
Congressman 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, founded the bipartisan 
Congressional PFAS Task Force to 
bring Republicans and Democrats to-
gether to address this growing and ur-
gent public health threat. We now have 
50 members up from the 14 members 
that we started with. As more Members 
of Congress learn about contamination 
in their districts, they are joining this 
movement. 
We are beginning to know the prob-
lem, and we know that we have to do 
more urgently to act to clean up and 
address PFAS in the environment. 
That is why I am a strong supporter 
of the bipartisan PFAS Action Act, a 
bill pushed through the Energy and 
Commerce Committee with the support 
of many Members, but most impor-
tantly, my Michigan colleague, Con-
gresswoman DEBBIE DINGELL. 
According 
to 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group, over 100 million people 
are exposed to PFAS in their drinking 
water. This isn’t acceptable. Every 
American 
deserves 
clean 
drinking 
water. 
The PFAS Action Act will help pro-
tect families from PFAS in their 
drinking 
water, 
lakes, 
rivers, 
and 
streams and in the air by requiring 
PFAS to be listed under the Safe 
Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water 
Act, and the Clean Air Act. It will also 
require polluters and corporations to 
clean up their PFAS contamination 
through CERCLA. 
It is important that Congress acts, 
because the Trump administration has 
not. 
While the EPA and the Defense De-
partment both have had authority to 
protect the public from PFAS, they 
have so far failed in their responsibil-
ities to address this public health cri-
sis. 
The EPA has run a public relations 
campaign to convince us that they care 
about PFAS but has failed to act to 
regulate these dangerous chemicals, 
even missing their own promised dead-
lines to act. 
Just this week, the White House sig-
naled that it would likely veto this leg-
islation. In threatening to veto this 
bill, President Trump and his adminis-
tration clearly are siding with pol-
luters instead of protecting the health 
of the American people. 
This act represents a continued push 
by this bipartisan group of legislators 
for much-needed legislation to clean up 
PFAS and to safeguard us from these 
chemicals. 
Some of the provisions in this bill 
were taken out of the recently passed 
NDAA by Senate Republicans, who 
sided again with President Trump and 
the administration on behalf of cor-
porate polluters to block these provi-
sions from becoming law. 
While we were able to include many 
good PFAS provisions in the NDAA, in-
cluding phasing out of firefighting 
foam, requiring polluters to report 
when they release PFAS into the envi-
ronment, and allowing for a nationwide 
study of PFAS contamination, many of 
these critical provisions were ulti-
mately blocked by Senate Republicans. 
The House will continue to act to 
protect public health and urge action 
for Oscoda and so many other places 
around the country. 
I also, obviously, urge the passage of 
my amendment, which would promote 
transparency and streamline EPA re-
sources to help people potentially ex-
posed to PFAS and other contaminants 
to understand better what their test 
results mean. 
In the U.S., well water is essentially 
unregulated. For the 43 million people 
in our country with well water, when 
they get testing results back, it is hard 
for them to understand how it could 
impact their family’s water supply. 
Under this amendment, the EPA 
website 
would 
be 
simplified 
and 
streamlined, making it easier for mil-
lions of American families to under-
stand the threat they face. 
Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues, 
Congressman KIND from Wisconsin and 
Congressman 
GALLAGHER, 
for 
sup-
porting me with this amendment. I en-
courage its adoption. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Chair, I urge 
my colleagues to adopt this. 
Just to be clear, I support the under-
lying 
legislation, 
obviously. 
The 
amendment simply requires that we 
provide an opportunity for people who 
are potentially going to be affected by 
PFAS, particularly in drinking water 
but also from other sources, to be able 
to understand easily the threat they 
face. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
this. Ultimately, this amendment is 
about making sure people are armed 
with the information that they need to 
protect their families. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I ap-
preciate my friend and colleague from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H135 
January 9, 2020 
Michigan. He has been very active on 
this issue for many years now, and I re-
spect his intensity and his efforts. A 
couple of things, because a lot of the 
debate was initially just on the overall 
bill. 
It is the Senate that caused us not to 
enact all these provisions in the NDAA. 
That is why they are on record as not 
going to move this bill. 
We did have a chance for the Safe 
Drinking Water Act to be included in 
the final piece of legislation. That was 
blocked by someone, and now, here we 
are. 
The President has threatened to veto 
the act. You are correct about that. 
Mr. KILDEE also raised the benefits of 
what we did do, and I listed them ear-
lier, from the EPA to mandate that 
drinking water systems monitor for 
unregulated PFAS, provide grants to 
communities, require new reporting of 
PFAS under the Toxics Release Inven-
tory program, require manufacturers 
and processors of PFAS to submit 
health and safety information—these 
are all law today—restrictions on new 
uses of long-change PFAS, guidance for 
appropriate 
destruction 
of 
per- 
or 
polyfluorinated compounds, require the 
Federal Government to work expedi-
tiously with States to enter into bind-
ing cooperative agreements. That is 
particularly important for the gentle-
man’s State, which was a success. Of 
course, I have many more. 
I would also like to highlight the ap-
propriations bill, which included $2.8 
billion for the Clean Water and Drink-
ing Water State Revolving Fund, with 
that $20 million going for this issue. 
You do adequately highlight the suc-
cess that we made at the end of last 
year on these two programs. We don’t 
want to diminish the success. I know it 
is not as far as a lot of people wanted 
to go, but there was some success. 
To your amendment, it is a fed-
eralism debate. Water wells in States 
are regulated, controlled, and tested by 
the States, not the EPA. 
Under this amendment, the Federal 
Government would have to collect and 
manage information about individuals 
and their property. This amendment, 
both broad and vague at the same time, 
would be an enormous expansion of the 
Federal Government into an area that 
has been governed by States. 
If these wells in the gentleman’s 
State are not being tested, they are not 
being tested by his State, and I know 
his State is very aggressive. 
Mr. KILDEE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SHIMKUS. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan. 
Mr. KILDEE. You raise an excellent 
point. The issue is, we could mandate, 
if you would choose to, that States pro-
vide information on a website that is 
easily discernible. The problem is that 
while wells and other sources may be 
tested—I don’t know if you have had 
the opportunity to read the published 
tests from those examinations. The 
idea of the amendment is not just to 
see that the information is somehow 
available somewhere but available in a 
fashion that is easily discernible by 
people who are not scientists. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Reclaiming my time, 
so you are saying your State is not ca-
pable of doing it themselves? I mean, 
your State health department can’t do 
the research? 
You are also talking about private 
wells on private property, bringing the 
Feds in to list the water systems for 
that. Obviously, under the system of 
Federal Government, we are raising 
some concerns on that amendment. 
Let me continue. If I have some time, 
we can go on. 
In addition to State departments of 
health that certify the laboratories—it 
is your department of health that cer-
tifies the laboratories that test the 
water, not EPA, as this legislation im-
plies. 
It would place a lot of burdens on 
EPA to carry out a program that 
States and local governments could 
more easily and appropriately handle. 
It would also likely take more than a 
year to establish this program, which 
is all the bill provides in this statutory 
language. 
I believe this amendment also places 
serious unfunded mandates on States. 
Finally, 
I 
have 
questions 
about 
whether the information being col-
lected and disseminated under this 
amendment can be done in a way that 
meets the proper risk communication 
strategies called for in the Brown 
amendment. 
That is why we have problems with 
this amendment. 
Mr. KILDEE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SHIMKUS. I yield to the gen-
tleman, my friend. 
Mr. KILDEE. I appreciate the gentle-
man’s concern. 
I think we may simply have a dis-
agreement as to whether or not there 
is a legitimate Federal role in ensuring 
that this information is readily avail-
able. 
I understand the point about States, 
but I believe this is a national interest 
in part because it is the Federal Gov-
ernment very often which is the big-
gest culprit here. 
The community, for example, that I 
represent in Oscoda, where so many in-
dividuals had their private wells af-
fected, they were affected by the Fed-
eral Government’s poisoning of the 
groundwater. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. I wish I could debate 
longer, but my time has expired. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MR. TONKO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 10 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, as the 
designee of the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), I rise to 
offer an amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of section 2, add the following: 
(c) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.—Not later than 60 
days after making a determination under 
subsection (b), the Administrator of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency shall make 
the results of such determination publicly 
available on the website of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TONKO) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank Congress Member LAWRENCE 
for her work on this amendment. 
The amendment, Madam Chair, is 
simple. It would ensure that the public 
is notified when any additional chemi-
cals in the PFAS family are designated 
as hazardous substances. 
More specifically, this amendment 
requires the EPA to publish its deter-
minations on the remaining PFAS 
chemicals on its publicly accessible 
website within 60 days. 
Public reporting helps communicate 
how government is working for the 
people. For agencies like the EPA, full 
transparency is necessary to inform 
our communities about threats to pub-
lic health and the environment. 
b 2030 
Our constituents have the right to 
know exactly what contaminants are 
in the air we breathe and the water we 
drink. As she noted in her statement in 
support of her amendment, in her home 
State of Michigan, she knows the im-
portance of clean air and clean water 
from firsthand experience. 
We know threats to our environment 
and public health do not discriminate, 
and the Representative concludes that 
she knows that, too often, it is the 
most important unrepresented and dis-
advantaged communities that are left 
behind. 
Mr. Chair, I urge support for the 
amendment 
from 
the 
gentlewoman 
from Michigan, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BRINDISI). 
The gentleman from Illinois is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, while I will 
not oppose this amendment, this sec-
tion, in particular, is objectionable. 
But putting Agency decisions on their 
website sounds like a reasonable pro-
posal. 
I am concerned about the timing of 
60 days—that would be something that 
the Agency can do without a problem— 
and would have preferred that the 
Agency was invited to testify on sweep-
ing an antiscience bill and its implica-
tions.

AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MISS RICE OF 
NEW YORK 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 11 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 37, lines 1 through 4, amend sub-
section (e) to read as follows: 
‘‘(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section not 
more than $125,000,000 for each of fiscal years 
2020 and 2021. 
‘‘(2) SPECIAL
RULE.—Of the amounts au-
thorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1), 
$25,000,000 are authorized to be appropriated 
for each of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for 
grants under subsection (a) to pay for capital 
costs associated with the implementation of 
eligible treatment technologies during the 
period beginning on October 1, 2014, and end-
ing on the date of enactment of this section. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman 
from New York (Miss RICE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair, 
my 
amendment 
would 
expand 
the 
PFAS Infrastructure Grant Program 
by 25 percent and designate the in-
creased funds for reimbursing water 
districts that have already started to 
address the PFAS water crisis. 
Like many communities across the 
Nation, Long Island, my district in 
New York, played a major role in the 
industrialization of America. Indus-
trialization brought unparalleled eco-
nomic growth, innovative new tech-
nologies, and transformed society as 
we know it. 
But with these great societal gains 
also came unintended consequences, 
like PFAS drinking water contamina-
tion. 
PFAS are toxic chemicals found in 
paint, cleaning products, packaging, 
and countless other products; and too 
often, they find their way into our 
drinking water systems. 
According to a May 2019 study by the 
New York Public Interest Research 
Group, Long Island has the most con-
taminated drinking water in New York 
State, and Nassau County has the high-
est number of water systems with de-
tected emerging contaminants, includ-
ing PFOA and PFOS. 
For years, water districts across the 
country have had to invest millions of 
their own dollars on technology to se-
cure impacted wells and keep their 
residents 
safe. 
These 
costs 
have 
crushed our local communities, and 
that is why I have offered this amend-
ment today. 
Communities that could not wait for 
Federal action and that quickly redi-
rected resources to address this imme-
diate health threat should not be pun-
ished. The Federal Government failed 
to address this threat for decades. The 
least we can do now is help reimburse 
the costs incurred by local water dis-
tricts that acted when Congress failed 
to do so. 
Without this Federal reimbursement, 
costs could be unfairly transferred to 
residents in the form of higher water 
utility bills. We cannot let this happen. 
Residents should not be left with the 
bill when they had no responsibility for 
the crisis. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
from 
Long 
Island, 
Representatives 
PETER KING and TOM SUOZZI, for co-
leading this amendment with me, and 
our other bipartisan cosponsors, Rep-
resentatives 
FITZPATRICK, 
GRIJALVA, 
CISNEROS, and STEVENS, as well. 
This is a commonsense bipartisan 
priority, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support my amendment to 
help these communities. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair, I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman 
PALLONE
for supporting the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I will 
use the time that I have available. 
This amendment provides reimburse-
ment 
funding 
for 
treatment 
tech-
nologies that were purchased up to 5 
years ago. The program for which this 
amendment is offered is supposed to 
aid 
communities 
that 
have 
dem-
onstrated problems and are economi-
cally disadvantaged and cannot afford 
the new technology because of the ex-
pense. That is why we have the pro-
gram. 
This amendment suggests that com-
munity water systems that had the 
means and no expectation of Federal 
funding to pay for them get money for 
past work. It does not seem a fair use 
and diversion of taxpayer resources 
considering the expense of the tech-
nology that can currently meet the cri-
teria of an eligible technology and the 
unknown nature of the communities 
that might need it. 
According to the EPA, there are few, 
if any, reverse osmosis treatment op-
tions that are economically viable on a 
mass scale that would remove all de-
tectable amounts of PFAS. 
I understand the intent of the legisla-
tion, but our grant and loan programs 
are designed for communities that 
can’t afford the expense. What my col-
league is asking is that those commu-
nities that could and did make the in-
vestment, that they then be reim-
bursed, thus depriving communities 
that can’t afford to do it an oppor-
tunity to obtain it. 
Mr. Chair, that is why we object to 
the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Miss RICE). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF 
MARYLAND 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the committee print, insert 
the following new section: 
SEC. 19. RISK-COMMUNICATION STRATEGY. 
The Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall develop a risk-com-
munication strategy to inform the public 
about the hazards or potential hazards of 
perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
sub-
stances, or categories of perfluoroalkyl and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances, by— 
(1) disseminating information about the 
risks or potential risks posed by such sub-
stances or categories in land, air, water (in-
cluding drinking water), and products; 
(2) notifying the public about exposure 
pathways and mitigation measures through 
outreach and educational resources; and 
(3) consulting with States that have dem-
onstrated 
effective 
risk-communication 
strategies for best practices in developing a 
national risk-communication strategy. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
I want to first thank Chairman PAL-
LONE, Chairman TONKO, and Congress-
woman DINGELL for this comprehensive 
package. 
We know PFAS-related substances 
remain in our bodies and environment 
for years, if not decades. Coupled with 
widespread consumer use and pollu-
tion, PFAS toxins could result in long- 
lasting public health problems. 
This legislation confronts PFAS con-
tamination, spurs cleanup efforts, and 
sets a drinking water limit. It is crit-
ical for government agencies to inform 
the public of the risk posed by PFAS- 
related substances. 
My amendment would require the 
EPA to develop a national risk commu-
nication strategy to share the best

available science about PFAS and its 
hazards, notify the public about risks 
and mitigation measures, and consult 
with States with effective statewide 
risk communication strategies of their 
own. 
In my home State of Maryland, 
PFAS has been identified in the water 
at eight DOD installations, tainting 
neighboring communities’ local wells 
and seeping into the Chesapeake Bay 
watershed. I am proud that Maryland 
is committed to PFAS transparency 
and research and is taking this issue 
seriously. 
Mr. Chair, there are some commu-
nities that are especially vulnerable to 
PFAS exposure, among them, fire-
fighters at military installations. To 
stop the spread of fire at training sites, 
fire departments use a type of fire-
fighting foam that contains PFAS-re-
lated substances. 
Over the course of their careers, 
these firefighters put themselves in 
harm’s way, unaware of the toxicity of 
these chemicals and the health issues 
they can cause down the road. We owe 
these servicemen and -women an unre-
coverable debt, and it is our duty to 
communicate to them the hazards that 
they were exposed to while risking 
their lives protecting the public. 
Whether it is former firefighters, 
military families living on bases, or 
the American people at large, the ex-
change of information between commu-
nities, risk assessors, and scientists is 
critical. 
As we continue to learn more about 
the full range of health problems 
linked to PFAS, we must also commu-
nicate that risk to the public. Sharing 
this risk, the knowledge of the risk, is 
an important step to give the public 
the resources they need to defend 
against PFAS contamination and the 
adverse health impacts it can cause. 
Madam Chair, I encourage my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this amendment and the under-
lying bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I do not oppose it. 
The Acting CHAIR (Miss RICE of New 
York). Without objection, the gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam 
Chair, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentleman from Maryland 
for yielding. 
I rise in support of the gentleman’s 
amendment. By requiring the EPA to 
develop a national risk communication 
strategy surrounding PFAS, the Fed-
eral Government will be better able to 
educate Americans and inform the pub-
lic about the danger of PFAS chemi-
cals. 
Experts believe that 99 percent of 
Americans have some level of PFAS in 
their blood, and most of them don’t 
even know it. 
I thank the gentleman for his strong 
leadership in addressing the PFAS cri-
sis head-on and thank him for offering 
this amendment. 
Incorporating this amendment will 
make the PFAS Action Act stronger 
and communicate the urgency to more 
people. I am proud to support this 
amendment and urge all of my col-
leagues to support it as well. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam 
Chair, I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, we sup-
port the amendment because we think 
it is important to have a national risk 
communication strategy. 
We get troubled and we get confused 
in this debate when we are going to de-
clare 7,866 chemicals toxic without 
doing the basic science. Hopefully, as 
we move this forward, I believe we are 
going to find some of the 7,866 that are 
safe, so when we do a risk advisory, we 
are going to be able to say: These are 
bad; these are okay. 
What the bill does is just say they 
are all bad, and we don’t have any 
science to prove that. I think we are 
close on PFOA, and we are close to 
that on PFOS. 
Again, we could have moved in a bi-
partisan manner to address those. We 
didn’t do that. But we would like, as 
the EPA considers this and informing 
the public, that they look at hazard 
identification, 
exposure 
assessment, 
and a risk characterization. 
So risk is a combination of time and 
exposure over a period of time. You can 
talk to toxicologists. That is what they 
do. That was the glue that held the 
TSCA bill together was the focus on 
using science. 
Again, as you have heard tonight and 
you will hear tomorrow, our problem is 
that we are rushing legislation before 
we are allowing the science to truly 
evaluate this, and we are classifying, 
currently, all 7,866 as hazardous, which 
I don’t believe they are. 
We have never, in the history of this 
Republic, under the Superfund Act, leg-
islatively banned a chemical. We have 
always allowed scientific process. 
So I think the amendment is helpful 
in that it helps us be able to clarify 
when we do the scientific analysis what 
is safe, what is not. 
Informing the public is good. Trans-
parency is great. We support the 
amendment. We appreciate the gen-
tleman bringing it forward. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, for decades, Americans 
have been exposed to toxic PFAS 
chemicals and there are not sufficient 
protections in place to safeguard our 
communities, our drinking water, and 
our environment. Americans are get-
ting sick from these forever chemicals 
that are known to cause cancer, im-
mune disorders, and thyroid problems, 
among other serious health conditions. 
I represent so many tireless advo-
cates and concerned citizens in New 
Hampshire who have identified this 
threat in their own communities and 
raised 
our 
collective 
consciousness 
about the dangers of PFAS. 
I have heard about PFAS from too 
many servicemembers and their fami-
lies who were exposed to high con-
centrations in drinking water on a 
base. 
I have heard about it from residents 
who have had their private wells con-
taminated by a manufacturing plant. 
I have heard about it from families 
who live near a landfill where PFAS- 
laden waste was dumped, an area that 
also has some of the Nation’s highest 
cancer rates. 
We must recognize that we are only 
having this conversation today because 
of advocates like them across the coun-
try who have sounded the alarm. It is 
about time we implement policies that 
address the widespread contamination 
that exists in every one of our dis-
tricts. 
We would be negligent if we fail to do 
so. 
I am offering an important, bipar-
tisan amendment to this legislation 
that is based on a bill that I have filed, 
the Clean Water Standards for PFAS 
Act. If we want to truly protect the 
public from PFAS, we must stop pollu-
tion which continues today. We must 
prevent industry and other polluters 
from 
dumping 
PFAS 
into 
rivers, 
streams, and other bodies of water, and 
further contaminating the environ-
ment. 
This amendment calls on the EPA to 
set and enforce proactive limits for 
PFAS discharge. It also requires EPA 
to issue pretreatment standards for 
polluters who discharge PFAS directly 
to water treatment facilities. This 
amendment also creates a grant pro-
gram to provide assistance to treat-
ment facilities, ensuring that munici-
palities have the resources to meet 
these requirements that will help keep 
our communities safe. 
My constituents deserve clean water. 
There is nothing more important than 
the health and safety of our commu-
nities, and we must work together to 
stop PFAS from getting into the envi-
ronment and poisoning our drinking 
water. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I urge 
all of my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this amendment. And I want to thank 
all of those who have stepped forward 
to address this issue, including the bi-
partisan 
Congressional 
PFAS 
Task 
Force as well as the coleads of this par-
ticular 
amendment, 
Representatives 
ROUDA, 
DELGADO, 
FITZPATRICK, 
KUSTER, CISNEROS, and KILDEE. 
I really appreciate the discussion 
here today. It is about time that we go 
beyond action plans and actually im-
plement some policies that are going 
to affect people’s lives in a positive 
manner back home. I urge adoption of 
this amendment and the underlying 
bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, I understand this re-
flects an effort to improve this pro-
posal from when we considered it under 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, but I don’t know what has 
changed or what it means since there 
has been no hearing or a markup 
record for me to consult to better ap-
preciate this proposal or its impacts. 
There 
are 
7,866 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated compounds listed on 
EPA’s PFAS master list, an unin-
formed policy could carry massive un-
intended consequences on the liability 
and regulatory forms. 
As I read it, this amendment con-
tinues an antiscience mindset that 
seeks to regulate first, without ade-
quate knowledge or understanding of 
the per- and polyfluorinated compound 
situation and then say, okay, we will 
figure it out later. 
This amendment covers PFAS sub-
stances that may not necessarily be 
what chemicals the industry is cur-
rently using, and simultaneously man-
dates creating new standards for every 
measurable PFAS chemical substance. 
This means EPA will be forced to di-
vert resources to chase those PFAS 
that are no longer in use and may not 
be necessary. 
The amendment requires EPA to reg-
ulate PFAS compounds through the 
Clean Water Act without validated an-
alytical 
methods 
for 
detention 
in 
wastewater; 
without 
established 
science or human and environmental 
impacts to determine appropriate and

legally, scientifically defensible stand-
ards; and without an understanding of 
how best to treat and remove pollut-
ants from wastewater, even if there 
was a validated method for detection. 
The deadline in this amendment will 
likely make EPA’s work to implement 
it vulnerable to a legal challenge, de-
laying any real benefit that the pro-
ponents want from it, and enriching 
the trial bar in the process. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Mr. 
PAPPAS). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-

Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. PLASKETT 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 14 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the committee print, add the 
following new section: 
SEC. 19. ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES FOR AD-
DRESSING 
EMERGING 
CONTAMI-
NANTS, 
WITH 
A 
FOCUS 
ON 
PERFLUOROALKYL 
AND 
POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES. 
Section 1452(t) of the Safe Drinking Water 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300j–12) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as para-
graph (3); and 
(2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(2) ASSISTANCE
TO
TERRITORIES.—Of the 
amounts made available under this sub-
section, the Administrator may use funds to 
provide grants to the Virgin Islands, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, American Samoa, and Guam for the 
purpose of addressing emerging contami-
nants, with a focus on perfluoroalkyl and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman 
from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I rise 
in support of this amendment. 
This amendment is simply a correc-
tion. It would make the United States 
territories eligible for additional Safe 
Drinking Water Act funding authorized 
to address emerging contaminants like 
PFAS. 
Today, we are discussing PFAS, toxic 
chemicals that have posed adverse pub-
lic health risks and have persisted be-
cause they could not break down. Their 
carbon fluoride bond is the strongest 
bond in nature, so PFAS contamina-
tion is continuing to be found all 
across the country: in the water, air, 
and soil. It has been extraordinarily 
widespread. 
EPA has acknowledged that millions 
of people in this country receive drink-
ing water with PFAS over the health 
advisory limit, and the United States 
territories have been no exception to 
this. 
It has been a serious issue for com-
munities that have been impacted, and 
more and more communities will be 
known to be impacted. A lot of those 
who have detected it are taking ac-
tions, which are expensive, to remove 
it from the drinking water. 
That is why this bill, as reported out 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and under the recent NDAA, 
provides new grant funding to assist 
water utilities struggling with this 
issue, contamination in the drinking 
water and others. 
However, as currently written, this 
grant funding has only been made 
available to States through the Drink-
ing Water Act’s State Revolving Fund 
program, which does include the Dis-
trict of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as 
States, but not other U.S. territories, 
which are generally provided with a 
separate reservation of overall pro-
gram funding annually. 
My amendment simply corrects this 
new program to permit the EPA to pro-
vide such grants to these American ter-
ritories, including my district in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, to assist their 
water utilities with PFAS treatment if 
it is found. 
These territories have some of the 
most severe needs for Federal assist-
ance in the area of clean water and 
drinking water-related infrastructure, 
and these needs have historically tend-
ed to be woefully underfunded. 
They often have received less on a 
per capita basis than a number of simi-
larly situated States. If Congress is to 
assist American communities with the 
removal of toxic PFAS from drinking 
water, it is only fair to include all 
American territories as eligible to re-
ceive this assistance. 
I urge approval of my amendment as 
simply a matter of fairness. I would 
also take this opportunity to gently re-
mind my colleagues to please consider 
Americans in territories in developing 
legislation intended to assist all Amer-
icans. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, in 
closing, I would like to just acknowl-
edge to the Chair the support of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, par-
ticularly my good friend, Mr. TONKO 
from New York, as well as Congress-
woman DEBBIE
DINGELL, for intro-
ducing this legislation and all of the 
staff that has worked on this. 
I urge adoption of this amendment as 
part of fairness to all Americans who 
face this issue, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, we all support the ter-
ritories having funding to address their 
drinking water needs. The biggest con-
cern is, the territories really operate 
from a different system because they 
don’t have the loan program. They 
don’t really have the money to pay 
back the loan program. So there is a 
system by which grant funding is 
awarded to the territories to make up 
this need. 
So the concern is that the amend-
ment may disenfranchise the States 
from taking from the revolving fund 
program, when the territories, histori-
cally, because they don’t use that, they 
get more grant money. So that is why 
we oppose it. We think it is going to 
impact the States’ ability to apply for 
these funds, and we think that the ter-
ritories have a different method of 
grant funding to meet their qualities 
and needs. 
I request a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MR. BRINDISI 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 15 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Amend section 15(a) to read as follows: 
(a) LISTING.— 
(1) INITIAL
LISTING.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall issue a final rule 
adding perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, 
and perfluoroactanesulfonic acid and its 
salts, to the list of hazardous air pollutants 
under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7412(b)). 
(2) ADDITIONAL LISTINGS.—Not later than 5

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H140 
January 9, 2020 
Mr. BRINDISI. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, I want to thank my 
colleagues from across the aisle, Mr. 
REED from New York and Mr. GALLA-
GHER from Wisconsin, for their support 
of this amendment. 
Support for clean air and protecting 
public health are not Democratic or 
Republican values. They are American 
values, and I am glad to work with my 
colleagues 
on 
this 
commonsense 
amendment. 
My amendment is straightforward. 
First, it requires immediate action on 
the most dangerous types of PFAS, in-
cluding PFOA, which has been found at 
elevated levels in drinking water in 
many communities, including Hoosick 
Falls in upstate New York. 
For these obsolete chemistries, EPA 
would be required to swiftly list these 
and hazardous air pollutants under the 
Clean Air Act. While we take action on 
the chemicals of greatest concern, we 
will also give the EPA time for a 
thoughtful, science-based process that 
acknowledges the differences across 
PFAS chemicals. 
Our amendment will give the EPA 5 
years to establish risk-based standards 
that protect human health and the en-
vironment for the many other types of 
PFAS chemicals. 
This will bring the Clean Air Act pro-
visions into line with the CERCLA pro-
visions in this bill. We need to be 
thoughtful in this process. Protecting 
public health will make sure that our 
decisions are informed by the best 
science available. 
This amendment is a commonsense 
compromise that strikes that balance. 
I, again, thank Congresswoman DIN-
GELL and Chairman PALLONE, as well as 
Chairman TONKO for their work on this 
important legislation, and their will-
ingness to work with me on our amend-
ment. 
I thank Congresswoman STEVENS for 
her work raising the issue of air con-
tamination when it comes to PFAS 
chemicals. 
I urge adoption of my amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. 
SHIMKUS. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I again 
urge adoption of my amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good 
attempt to try to bring some sense to 
this bill, and I appreciate my col-
league’s attempt. 
What the amendment does is it really 
creates 
unachievable 
expectations. 
There are a lot of problems with the 
amendment, but one is that you are 
asking for a final rule within 100 days, 
especially if it is not proposed, which is 
going to set up a deadline suit. 
I have dealt with deadline suits. You 
got a deadline, and they can’t meet it, 
then the agency gets sued. 
Why do we pay utilities to hold nu-
clear waste? Because they have enacted 
a deadline suit because we say we are 
going to take their waste, the Federal 
Government. We didn’t take their 
waste, and now we have to pay the util-
ities to hold the waste that we were 
supposed to take. 
That is one issue that I have a con-
cern. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
7,866 
compounds, 
Clean Air Act aspects, and you are 
going to have, as I used numerous 
times during the National Defense Au-
thorization Act debate, as I have used 
on the rule debate, these 7,866 different 
aspects of PFAS we are coming to the 
floor not using science, not using due 
diligence, but using political science to 
say ban it. 
Our argument has always been to 
let’s do the science. The problem is, 
science takes a long time, and the po-
litical emotion of this debate just can’t 
wait. 
We have addressed a lot of these con-
cerns everybody raised throughout the 
night through the enacted National De-
fense Authorization Act and by the om-
nibus bill. But if you look at the F–16 
and the component parts, and we could 
have an automobile in the new electric 
vehicle era, new battery technology, 
medical devices, they are all going to 
have 
some 
type 
of 
per- 
or 
polyfluorinated compounds. 
This amendment with the bill really 
is a de facto ban on the use of all per- 
and polyfluorinated compounds, or it is 
going to scare the producers of this, 
that they don’t want to get caught in a 
litigation trap, so they are just not 
going to produce it. 
We have talked about firefighting 
foam quite a bit tonight. It is really a 
great debate because we do think there 
is some bipartisan nature that we can 
get to on that chemical. 
If you are in a nuclear sub under-
neath the Arctic icecap and a fire hap-
pens on the sub, do you want the sec-
ond-best firefighting foam? I mean, 
really, do you? The second-best means 
it takes more time, and it takes more 
water. I don’t think you do. But this is 
where we stand. 
The amendment creates both an un-
realistic burden and a litigation prob-
lem, and the EPA cannot possibly ful-
fill our requirement to review all PFAS 
for inclusion in the clean air policy in 
5 years. We only have 29 methods of de-
termining 
per- 
and 
polyfluorinated 
compounds right now, just 29. There 
are 7,866, and the amendment says to 
do it in 5 years. 
I wish it could be done. I have been 
here a long time. Government moves 
slowly. When we throw all these sites 
into the Superfund, people are going to 
be hollering about it for 40 years. I read 
the list earlier of all these Superfund 
sites that haven’t been remediated. 
Now, we are just going to expand that. 
Pull up the map of the country and all 
those red States, either that is going to 
be where all the Superfund sites are or 
that is where all the class action law-
suits are going to be filed in those 
States to take down those companies 
that are providing either safe medical 
devices or equipment for our career and 
best airplanes and technologies. 
Again, I want to applaud my col-
league. I think this is something we 
could have done. We actually were 
talking about this in a compromise 
provision. We couldn’t get there be-
cause of other issues. It is a valiant at-
tempt. My friend is in the majority, 
and it is going to pass. Unfortunately, 
the Senate is not going to take up this 
bill, and the President already has a 
veto message on the bill. So it will be 
teed up for the next Congress, and I 
wish the gentleman luck. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. GOLDEN). The 
question is on the amendment offered 
by the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
BRINDISI). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 16 OFFERED BY MR. BRINDISI 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 16 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment as the designee of 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
KIM). 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 36, line 12, insert ‘‘, after providing an 
opportunity for public comment,’’ after ‘‘the 
Administrator’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. BRINDISI) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, 
Congressman KIM, for writing this 
amendment, and I rise on his behalf to 
offer it tonight. 
This amendment is straightforward. 
It ensures that the list of technologies 
that are most effective in removing 
PFAS from drinking water are made 
public and available for public com-
ment prior to final publication. This 
will allow healthy debate and discus-
sion by scientific experts, universities, 
industry, and the public to help under-
stand the most effective means of 
cleanup. By allowing the public to see 
this information, we can help ensure 
the EPA is putting our best ideas and 
methods toward cleaning up these 
chemicals and making our drinking 
water safe. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this 
commonsense amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

January 9, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment, but I 
do not plan to object to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Illinois is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Chairman, I urge 
adoption of this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, there is no objection 
to having EPA obtaining technical 
input on technologies that are effective 
in 
removing 
PFAS 
from 
drinking 
water. I am concerned how formal a 
process the amendment seeks to im-
pose. I was going to ask questions of 
Mr. KIM or Mr. PALLONE. They are not 
here, and that is fine. 
The amendment only calls for public 
comment, but a full-blown notice and 
opportunity for public comment is an 
enormously expensive and time-con-
suming process for any agency, includ-
ing the EPA. If the focus of the bill is 
to meet the timelines it imposes and 
not hold up grantmaking for a public 
comment process to play out, I think 
this amendment needs to be rethought 
a bit to get at the author’s intent with-
out tripping up EPA from executing 
the program. 
I will not oppose this amendment be-
cause I know there are larger problems 
with this bill that will prevent it from 
becoming law, but I want to highlight 
that this is an acceptable amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. AXNE). The 
question is on the amendment offered 
by the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
BRINDISI). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MR. GOLDEN 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 17 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 47, after line 15, insert the following 
new subsection (and redesignate the subse-
quent subsection accordingly): 
(b) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than two 
years after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and annually thereafter, the Adminis-
trator, in consultation with the head of the 
U.S. Fire Administration, shall submit to 
Congress a report on the effectiveness of the 
guidance issued under subsection (a). Such 
report shall include recommendations for 
congressional actions that the Adminis-
trator determines appropriate to assist ef-
forts to reduce exposure to PFAS by fire-
fighters and the other persons described in 
subsection (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maine. 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Chair, I rise 
today to offer an amendment to H.R. 
535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019. 
First, I thank Chairman PALLONE, 
Congresswoman DINGELL, and the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee for 
bringing this bill to the floor today. We 
all know that PFAS contamination is a 
national issue that has devastated 
communities across the country. 
As of October 2019, the Maine Depart-
ment of Environmental Protection has 
more than 30,000 records for PFAS at 
244 locations across the State of Maine. 
In my district, areas surrounding the 
former Loring Air Force Base, Houlton 
International Airport, Bangor Inter-
national Airport, the Navy VLF Radio 
Station in Cutler, and the Bog Brook 
military training site in Gilead are 
known to be contaminated with PFAS 
compounds. 
Groundwater, surface water, soil, and 
sediment samples collected from these 
sites identified the presence of these 
chemicals, posing a major risk to pub-
lic health and safety. 
We also know that emergency re-
sponse teams are frequently exposed to 
PFAS in firefighting foams as they 
work to keep communities safe. Given 
my State still relies on not only career 
firefighters but a tremendous amount 
of volunteer firefighters, the threat of 
PFAS contamination and the resulting 
health risks is something I take seri-
ously. 
That is why I am pleased to see that 
the bill we are debating today includes 
a provision that would require the EPA 
Administrator, with the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration, to issue guidance on 
minimizing the use of firefighting foam 
and related equipment containing any 
PFAS by firefighters and other first re-
sponders. 
However, I think it is important for 
Congress and the public to know just 
how effective this provision will be on 
the long-term health of our first re-
sponders. That is why I am offering an 
amendment that would require the 
EPA Administrator, in consultation 
with the U.S. Fire Administration, to 
brief Congress on the effectiveness of 
the guidance they are providing, to in-
clude recommendations for congres-
sional actions that the Administrator 
determines appropriate to assist efforts 
to reduce exposure to PFAS by fire-
fighters and other first responders. 
This is a commonsense amendment 
to ensure that the Federal Government 
follows through on its commitment to 
protect the men and women who enter 
into harm’s way to keep our commu-
nities safe. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BRINDISI). 
The gentleman from Illinois is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I understand the gen-
tleman from Maine’s problem with the 
airports. Fortunately, we have exempt-
ed airports from Superfund liability, 
and there is not going to be an ability 
for the gentleman’s sites to get cleaned 
up. 
Other than that, based upon this 
amendment, we think the basic amend-
ment is unnecessary. There is no objec-
tion to having EPA report annually on 
firefighter foam guidance. This amend-
ment, though, does not have an end to 
annual reporting, and firefighting foam 
with fluorine is supposed to be phased 
out in 3 years under the military specs. 
Maybe moving forward, there could be 
a deadline. 
In addition, the amendment asks for 
recommendations to Congress to re-
duce exposure to PFAS and firefighting 
foam. This assumes that any remaining 
foam is hazardous, and meaningful safe 
is not examined, only exposure, a very 
nonscientific way to address the prob-
lem. 
Plus, I would prefer that there be 
some discussion, considering who is 
writing the report. The foam effect in 
this is discussed. Let’s not add incom-
plete reporting. An underlying bill 
places enough unnecessary burdens on 
the public. 
Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN). 
The amendment was agreed to.

Page 37, beginning on line 1, amend sub-
section (e) to read as follows: 
‘‘(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section not 
more than— 
‘‘(A) $125,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 
and 2021; and 
‘‘(B) $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 
through 2024. 
‘‘(2) SPECIAL
RULE.—Of the amounts au-
thorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1), 
$25,000,000 are authorized to be appropriated 
for each of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for 
grants under subsection (a) to pay for capital 
costs associated with the implementation of 
eligible treatment technologies during the 
period beginning on October 1, 2014, and end-
ing on the date of enactment of this section. 
Mrs. AXNE (during the reading). Mr. 
Chair, I ask unanimous consent to dis-
pense with the reading. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the request of the gentlewoman 
from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the original request of the gentle-
woman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment 
is modified. 
The gentlewoman from Iowa is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I have heard from 
many parents in my district worried 
about PFAS contamination in their 
drinking water. PFAS are manmade 
chemicals that can pose serious health 
risks and are of great concern to my 
constituents. 
In large quantities, PFAS are dan-
gerous and deadly to human health, 
and these forever chemicals are going 
to take a lot of work and innovation to 
clean up. These chemicals have been 
linked to cancer, effects on the im-
mune system, and impaired child de-
velopment. 
While PFAS chemicals have not been 
found in the water supply in my dis-
trict, there is a known contamination 
site. Our community has stepped up 
and is working together through a 
PFAS Working Group to address this 
contamination and conduct further 
testing, but it is past time that the 
Federal Government steps in, stops the 
production of these dangerous chemi-
cals, requires cleanup, and provides re-
sources to ensure that our commu-
nities aren’t left to fight this alone. 
Our public water utilities provide a 
critical service to our communities by 
ensuring families have safe and clean 
drinking 
water. 
However, 
without 
proper support, many water utilities 
won’t be able to afford the necessary 
upgrades or would be forced to put the 
costs back on the backs of their com-
munity. 
I am glad that this legislation cre-
ates a grant program to provide fund-
ing for water utilities to upgrade their 
drinking water systems in order to ef-
fectively remove PFAS. The PFAS In-
frastructure Grant Program will en-
sure utilities have the resources they 
need to protect our water systems 
without burdening the communities 
they serve with an unaffordable ex-
pense. 
However, as the bill is written now, 
the PFAS Infrastructure Grant Pro-
gram would only be authorized for 2 
years. Our communities need more 
flexibility and time when deciding the 
best way to upgrade their water infra-
structure and to combat PFAS. 
My amendment would extend the 
PFAS Infrastructure Grant Program 
for an additional 3 years, allowing 
water utilities time to properly address 
their needs, test their water, and re-
quest funding, as necessary. 
Additionally, my amendment would 
increase the funding available by $300 
million over that 3-year period. By 
more than doubling the current au-
thorized 
amount, 
my 
amendment 
would ensure there are enough funds 
available so utilities can afford these 
necessary upgrades without negatively 
impacting the critical work that they 
do. 
My State of Iowa also has many rural 
drinking water systems that don’t have 
the scale to afford massive infrastruc-
ture costs. We see, time and time 
again, that smaller water systems are 
unable to remove hazardous and dan-
gerous materials simply because of 
cost barriers. I am pleased that the un-
derlying bill prioritizes small drinking 
water systems, and my amendment en-
sures the program has enough funding 
so no community is left behind. 
This legislation is an important step 
to ensure Iowa families have access to 
safe drinking water without these 
harmful PFAS chemicals. My amend-
ment strengthens the PFAS Infrastruc-
ture Grant Program, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman for his support of the 
amendment. I am glad there is bipar-
tisan support to ensure that our com-
munities have the drinking water and 
resources they need to protect that. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SHIMKUS. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
thank my colleague. I rose in opposi-
tion, just so she understands that I will 
be 
speaking 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
amendment. I appreciate the kind 
words. 
Mr. Chair, I wish she would have been 
here when the Rice amendment was on 
the floor, which has been passed and 
added to the bill, which would now 
allow the rich communities that have 
already paid for their modifications at 
great expense to be able to dip back 
into these funds at the expense of rural 
communities. That was an amendment 
we passed earlier. 
Mr. Chair, under this legislation, 
EPA is supposed to issue a national 
primary drinking water standard for 
PFAS, but PFOA and PFOS at a min-
imum. Once this is done, communities 
that are disadvantaged—and I am from 
rural Illinois, 33 counties—one, assist-
ance for installing technology are eli-
gible for the drinking water State-re-
volving loan programs. 
This amendment creates a double- 
dipping opportunity for communities 
when the main focus of the Safe Drink-
ing Water Act State revolving fund is 
to help struggling systems meet the 
mandate it imposes to protect public 
health. 
More practically, because of budget 
allocations that the House appropri-
ators are supposed to operate under, in-
creased capitalization grants will suf-
fer. Money, to the tune of $75 million, 
will be diverted to this particular 
PFAS grant program at the expense of 
the State revolving fund. 
Communities, especially rural com-
munities, not only with PFAS but 
other compliance and health problems 
as well, could and will likely be a loser, 
so that is why I rise in opposition to 
the amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment, as modified, offered 
by the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. 
AXNE). 
The amendment, as modified, was 
agreed to. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I move that 
the Committee do now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. BRINDISI, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 535) to require the Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency to designate per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
as 
haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980, had come to no resolution there-
on.

mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, if there 
was any doubt that last month’s im-
peachment vote was purely political, 
there shouldn’t be now. 
Throughout the partisan impeach-
ment inquiry, we were told that it was 
critical to move quickly because the 
threat of waiting was too great. The 
Schiff report even said: ‘‘We cannot 
wait.’’ 
In the interest of speed, any hope of 
fairness was discarded. Rules were bro-
ken. Democrats couldn’t wait on a mi-
nority hearing, breaking House rules

But 
Speaker 
PELOSI continues to hold the articles 
from the Senate in an attempt to dic-
tate the terms of the trial to Leader 
MCCONNELL. 
The Constitution grants the Senate 
the sole power to try all impeach-
ments, not the Speaker. 
Democrats voted to impeach the 
President for abuse of power and claim 
he is a threat to the Constitution, but 
look at what you are doing. You are 
trying to take the Senate’s constitu-
tional power for your own political 
gain. 
Follow the Constitution you spoke so 
much about. Transmit the articles to 
the Senate so that they can undertake 
their constitutional responsibility.

BRINDISI). Members are reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair.

IN CELEBRATION OF GEORGE 
STEVENS’ 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, tonight, 
I rise to celebrate a dear man in north-
ern California from the town of Palo 
Cedro in Shasta County. George Ste-
vens celebrated his 100th birthday on 
December 28. 
Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of 
being able to stop by and spend time 
with George and his family at the 
event at the Palo Cedro Community 
Center, to celebrate with him and rec-
ognize, also, his service to our country, 
which is pretty amazing. 
George is a Pearl Harbor survivor. He 
was there in the Army at the base 
there during the Pearl Harbor attack. 
Later, if that wasn’t enough, he ended 
up being deployed to Europe, where he 
was at the Normandy invasion later on 
in 1944. And if that wasn’t enough, a 
few months later in the winter, he 
fought at the Battle of the Bulge. 
None of us would have the freedom 
we have if it weren’t for people like 
George and all of his comrades who 
were there in that war preserving free-
dom for us and so many others with 
that sacrifice. 
He is a true patriot, a great Amer-
ican, and he is a guy that still drives 
and does his home repairs around his 
place there in Palo Cedro. 
Mr. Speaker, we are really proud of 
George and wish him a happy birthday. 
I am glad I got to spend time with him 
and his family. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 34 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, con-
sistent with the statement that was 
just made about BRIAN FITZPATRICK, I 
will be missing tomorrow’s votes. If I 
were here, I would vote ‘‘no.’’ There is 
too much good that is being done with 
the PFAS, and I would vote ‘‘no.’’ 
But I will be attending the funeral of 
a former Member of Congress, a great 
patriot, a friend, just a wonderful per-
son, Michael Fitzpatrick, and it was an 
honor to serve with him in this body. 
Obviously, we have had a lot of dis-
cussion about Iran, Soleimani, his 
death, the death of so many that he 
caused, and his role in being head of 
the IRGC, so I thought it would be 
helpful if we learned a little more for 
those who haven’t. 
It helps, I found, profoundly, if people 
know what they are talking about, and 
it seems there has been a whole lot of 
talking and not a lot of knowledge 
about what is going on with Iran. 
Many of us remember, and I sure re-
member because I was in the Army at 
Fort Benning at the time, when our 
Embassy in Tehran was attacked ini-
tially, it was said by the Iranian lead-
ers that the students attacked the Em-
bassy; and after days of President Car-
ter doing nothing but begging for them 
to let our people go, they realized that 
we were not going to do anything, and 
so they began to say: We have the hos-
tages. 
I always thought at the time, paying 
close attention to the news back in 
those days, that by saying the students 
did this that the Iranian leaders were 
giving themselves a back door if we 
had had a President who had put his 
foot down and said: Either you get 
them released, or we are going to come 
get them released ourselves; and if 
they are harmed, Iran will pay heavily. 
I felt that was probably where they 
would say: Hey, we got them from the 
students. Here they are. 
But that was the first clue after Viet-
nam that we were still a paper tiger. 
That is the way we were portrayed 
around the world. That is what we in 
the Army heard back in those days: 
Gee, all you have to do is drag out con-
frontation like Vietnam and they will 
turn tail and run. 
That appeared to be consistent with 
us doing nothing about our Embassy, 
which, under international law, is 
American soil. It is American property. 
It is American housing. It was at-
tacked, and we didn’t do anything 
about it for a lengthy time, which sent 
the message to the new leader in Iran, 
the Ayatollah Kohmeini, that we really 
were paper tigers. We were toothless. 
There was no power, no courage, and it 
encouraged them. 
b 2130 
In fact, there was one effort at a res-
cue but, unfortunately, the military’s 
hands were tied by people at the top. 
I was told by a friend in the Army 
back at the time that the White House 
was the one that had them cut back 
the number of helicopters that would 
go into the desert across, around 500 
miles or so of desert, with turbine en-
gines in the helicopters. And they 
knew, as my friend, General Boykin 
has confirmed, they had to get six to 
the landing area. Otherwise, it was an 
abort. And when it was clear only 5 
were going to make it, that the mis-
sion was aborted. 
The helicopter pilot may have gotten 
vertigo. The helicopter tilted. The 
blade went through a C–130 that was 
there to equip them for the trip in to 
rescue our hostages, and Americans 
were killed and left there in the desert 
at the staging area. 
If there had been an adequate number 
of helicopters allowed to go in, they 
would have had sufficient number of 
six or more to make it. But the number 
going in was cut back, I was told, by 
the White House. They didn’t want it 
to look like an invasion. 
I am proud we have got a President 
that is not worried about it. I mean, I 
have asked him about this before, and 
he is more concerned about protecting 
our American treasure, our American 
military members; and he wants to 
commit whatever our military needs to 
get the job done. That is a far cry from 
where we were in the late 1970s. 
In fact, I do recall President Carter, 
he had turned his back on the Shah. It 
didn’t sound like the Shah was a great 
person, a great humanitarian at all, 
but at least Iran and the area were not 
at war with us at that time. 
But when President Carter turned his 
back on the Shah, it opened the door 
for him to be overthrown. Apparently, 
people in the Carter White House did 
not give adequate thought to what hap-
pens when the Shah is gone, because 
what happened was the Ayatollah Kho-
meini. 
And President Carter, as I recall, 
welcomed 
the 
Ayatollah 
Khomeini 
back in charge of Iran—he had not been 
in charge before—but welcomed him 
back to Iran, and proclaimed he was a 
man of peace. It could not have been a 
more ignorant welcome to the man 
that would start Iran on the course to 
be the greatest source of terrorism in 
the world. 
So thank you very much to the Car-
ter administration. Great job. You 
brought in, allowed in people who have 
continued to kill Americans at a rate 
greater than anybody else. 
They have helped Afghanistan. That 
was a shock when we found that out. 
They have helped Sunnis, they have 
helped 
Shia. 
And 
normally, 
that 
doesn’t happen, but they are so dedi-
cated to destroying the Great Satan, 
America, in their view, and destroying 
the Little Satan, Israel, that we have 
to take them seriously. Too many 
Americans have been killed as a result 
of ignorance or optimism unjustified. 
But this is a study done from the Je-
rusalem Center for Public Affairs, a 
very good study done, and it gives us a 
lot of information about Iran. It points 
out that Iranian military action, often 
working through proxies, uses terrorist 
tactics; has led to the death of well 
over 1,000 American soldiers in Iraq and

Afghanistan over the last decade and a 
half. 
They point out that the explosively 
formed penetrators—a lot of people are 
familiar with the IEDs, but these are 
EFPs, explosively formed penetrators, 
a shaped charge designed to penetrate 
armor—that these are often camou-
flaged as rocks and were identical to 
those employed by Hezbollah against 
Israeli forces. 
In 2006, the British Telegraph re-
vealed that three Iranian factories 
were mass producing the roadside EFP 
bombs used to kill soldiers in Iraq. 
In 2007, American troops discovered 
over 100 Austrian-made Steyr HS .50, 
50-caliber sniper rifles, in Iraq. They 
can pierce all in-service body armor 
from up to a mile and penetrate U.S. 
armored Humvee troop carriers. 
I fired a 50-caliber sniper rifle at 
Quantico. It is amazing how powerful 
they are. 
But, unfortunately, they were found 
in Iraq, and they had apparently come 
from an Austrian manufacturer, but 
they were bought by Iran, and supplied 
by Iran, apparently, to Iraq to help kill 
American soldiers. 
Iran also paid Taliban fighters $1,000 
for each U.S. soldier they killed in Af-
ghanistan. In fact, the Sunni Times re-
ported that a Taliban operative re-
ceived $18,000 from an Iranian firm in 
Kabul as reward for an attack in 2010 
that killed several Afghan government 
troops and destroyed an American ar-
mored vehicle. 
Iranian President Rouhani’s so-called 
moderation, was displayed when he ap-
pointed 
Brigadier 
General 
Hossein 
Dehghan to be minister of defense. He 
had played a key role in the October 
1983 suicide bomb attacks in Beirut, in 
which 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French 
paratroopers were killed. 
And of course, Dehghan, apparently 
was replaced previously, in 1998 with a 
guy named Soleimani, who is with us 
perhaps in spirit only now, thanks to 
our current President and the ability 
of our United States military. 
Anti-Americanism helped fuel the 
1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, a vio-
lent anti-American doctrine that chal-
lenges any role for America in the Mid-
dle East, it has been, and remains the 
central focus of Iranian foreign policy. 
Since the revolution, Iran has waged 
and continues to wage war against the 
United States and its allies. Unfortu-
nately, though, Iran has been at war 
with the United States for 40 years 
now, since 1979, for sure—well, really, 
since the Ayatollah took over and 
President Carter welcomed him as a 
man of peace. He has not been a man of 
peace. He has been at war with the 
United States. 
The report points out the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC— 
people hear that term quite a bit, but 
that was founded by Ayatollah Kho-
meini shortly after the overthrow of 
the Shah at the onset of the Islamic 
Revolution in 1978–79. 
Iran’s RGC has morphed from its ini-
tial, mainly ideological, composition 
into a particularly powerful organ of 
Iran’s political system, the upper eche-
lons of which tend to be drawn from 
the ranks of the IRGC. They are devel-
oping an increasing lethal system such 
as advanced naval mines, coastal de-
fense, anti-ship cruise and ballistic 
missiles and attack craft. 
The IRGC boasts a paramilitary unit 
comprised of 10 to 20,000 individuals 
known as the Quds Force. That was 
what Soleimani commanded and was 
using strategically, killing Americans, 
as many as he could. 
The strategic objective of the IRGC- 
QF is to subvert Iran’s enemies and ex-
port the Iranian Revolution, a goal it 
attains largely by facilitating the de-
livery of weapons to pro-Iranian fac-
tions in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Persian 
Gulf States, Gaza, the West Bank, Af-
ghanistan, and central Asia. 
In 2007, the Treasury Department 
designated IRGC-QF as a terrorism- 
supporting entity. 
The report is quite extensive. It goes 
on to point out many of the efforts, 
successful efforts to kill Americans, 
talking about the Khobar Towers in 
1996 and many other attacks. 
But it points out that in 1998, Major 
General Qasem Soleimani has led the 
IRGC-QF, in which time he has created 
branches focused on intelligence, fi-
nance, politics, sabotage and special 
operations. With a direct independent 
channel to Khomeini, Soleimani has 
successfully sought the assassination 
of political rivals, armed terrorist 
proxies, and directed a network of in-
surgent groups in Iraq that killed over 
1,000 Americans. And that is just in 
Iraq. But we know more regarding 
what they have done in Afghanistan, in 
Lebanon, in Syria. 
Mr. Speaker, I see I am joined by my 
friend, who has served his country hon-
orably and well and made his way up to 
the rank of general. He knows a great 
deal about war in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for taking 
the time to discuss this with the Amer-
ican people and allowing me to be part 
of it. I saw the gentleman and I didn’t 
want him to have to carry the freight 
alone. 
There was a lot to be said today, and 
probably neither he nor I got to say ev-
erything we wanted to say about the 
proceedings over the last couple of 
weeks. And it frustrates me that our 
colleagues, right here in the House of 
the Congress will say, America assas-
sinated General Soleimani. 
You can put a general’s rank on a 
puppy dog, or a rabbit, or you name it, 
on a car or a truck. This guy is a ter-
rorist, no matter what he is wearing. 
He is a terrorist from a terrorist state, 
and that is his claim to fame. That is 
who he is. Responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds, if not thousands of Ameri-
cans, and certainly responsible for the 
deaths and maiming of thousands of 
Americans. 
And when they say, well, this Presi-
dent is starting a war. I wonder to my-
self, my goodness, where have you been 
for the last 40 years? Since 1979, right? 
The gentleman knows this. LOUIE 
GOHMERT knows this, right? 
We were all present and watched 
when Iran punched America in the face 
40 years ago. It hasn’t stopped. 
So finally, after 40 years of appease-
ment—and the gentleman knows this 
well, because he is a great student of 
history. 
Appeasement didn’t work in World 
War II, right? And the results, the re-
sults of appeasement, leading up to 
World War II, was the untold deaths 
and untimely deaths and miserable suf-
fering deaths of millions of people 
across Europe because of appeasement. 
Yet, we have tried it with Iran for 40 
years. Iran is playing long ball. People 
say, well, they were complying with 
the JCPOA and we let them out of it. 
Well, of course they were complying. 
There was nothing in it that stopped 
them from doing everything they want-
ed to do, which was get to a nuclear 
armed program where their ballistic 
missile program caught up to it, right? 
So for 10 years all they had to do is 
not let us inspect their military sites, 
because we didn’t demand or require 
that in the deal. They could keep on 
doing whatever they are doing there. 
Perfect their ballistic missile capabili-
ties so they can deliver the payload to 
Israel or the United States. 
Oh, and in 10 years we will have noth-
ing to say about it because we ap-
proved all of this. And then we have a 
terrorist nation that uses terrorism as 
statecraft with a nuclear missile. 
What is our leverage then? We have 
none, right? We have got another 
North Korea, is what we have. 
So it befuddles me that—I am sure 
our well-meaning colleagues on the 
other side think that this is going to 
work. Einstein, of course, he described 
the definition of insanity; it is doing 
the same thing over and over and over 
again and expecting a different out-
come. 
Appeasement is dangerous. It is pro-
vocative. It encourages despots to be 
despots. And so far, for 40 years, that is 
what we have watched. 
And finally, the President gave them 
warning after warning. They said, well, 
it wasn’t warranted. We didn’t have 
enough intelligence. 
There was open source reporting. 
They told us what they were going to 
do. Do you remember the 9/11 attacks, 
where there was open source reporting? 
And then, after the fact, everybody 
said, where were the intelligence and 
law 
enforcement 
agencies? 
Why 
weren’t they talking? 
Here, our enemy, who says they are 
going to kill the Great Satan and the 
Little Satan—that’s what they say, 
right? 
b 2145 
They tell us what they are going to 
do, yet it is not enough for some of my

colleagues who would have then said: 
Mr. President, what did you know and 
when did you know it? And why didn’t 
you do something about it? 
You know this, right? 
Mr. GOHMERT. In fact, it took me 
too long to get around to reading Win-
ston Churchill’s books on World War II, 
but he points out that when Hitler first 
moved into the Sudetenland, they were 
so disorganized that it was a disaster, 
that if there had been any resistance 
put up at all instead of Chamberlain 
waving a piece of paper that this means 
peace in our time and we are going to 
let him go in and move in and take 
over this land, that if there had been 
any resistance at all because of all the 
material breakdowns, mechanical fail-
ures—Hitler was furious. 
He said any resistance would have 
caused the defeat of the Germans mov-
ing in, and then the Germans would 
have been humiliated. They would 
have, in all likelihood, gotten rid of 
Hitler because he got too ambitious 
and exposed them to defeat. He would 
have been gone, and the world would 
have been spared the tens of millions of 
people who died as a result of trying to 
placate the man. 
Just supporting what my friend the 
Congressman is pointing out, it doesn’t 
usually 
work 
well, 
and 
it 
hasn’t 
worked well. I know there are people 
who say all we were doing was giving 
Iran their money back when we gave 
them all that money. Money is fun-
gible. We say maybe that specific 
money enabled them to continue sup-
porting Hezbollah and terrorists who 
would attack and kill Americans. 
Mr. PERRY. You are absolutely 
right. There is the moral equivalency. 
If we would just give the criminal, the 
terrorist, the murderer their money 
back, it is legitimate. It is theirs. Just 
disregard the fact that these are kill-
ing, murdering terrorists. 
There is no moral equivalence. You 
don’t give murdering terrorists money, 
whether it is theirs or anybody else’s. 
You throw them in jail. 
These people should probably legiti-
mately be in The Hague for crimes 
against humanity, not getting their 
money back. Among all the things that 
frustrate me, that is one of them. The 
other one, of course, is this whole war 
powers thing. 
We have had a year in this Congress, 
a year of escalation of Iran attacking 
American targets. In November and 
December alone, 24 or 25 times, over 
two dozen times, attacking American 
targets, but it was never an issue. 
You know when else it wasn’t an 
issue? The kind gentleman from Texas, 
it wasn’t an issue for 8 years when al-
most 4,000 people under the Obama ad-
ministration, terrorists, rightly were 
killed by drone strikes. You know what 
came from the other side of the aisle 
regarding the War Powers Act? Noth-
ing. 
We agree with President Obama on 
that. We didn’t agree on many things 
as Republicans with President Obama, 
but we agreed that eradicating terror-
ists was a good thing. He did it not in 
the war zone of Iraq, as approved by 
this Congress. He did it in Yemen, So-
malia, and Pakistan, sovereign na-
tions. The United States was going and 
killing people, including American citi-
zens, outside the combat zone, but not 
a peep. 
Yet today, with Iran watching, with 
our enemies watching, today is the day 
that we have to revise the War Powers 
Act and rein in a wayward President 
because he is trying to defend the 
country. 
The good Representative from Texas, 
it has nothing to do with the War Pow-
ers Act. This resolution that is never 
going to go to the President was all 
about campaign messaging. 
It is also messaging our enemies that 
we are divided in this country. We are 
not divided. We might be divided in 
this House, but we are not divided in 
this country. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an article here from January 2017, and 
the title from The Guardian is ‘‘Amer-
ica dropped 26,171 bombs in 2016. What 
a bloody end to Obama’s reign.’’ 
I remember specifically because I had 
been to Libya, but as our Defense Sec-
retary Bob Gates said in a live inter-
view, Libya is not in our vital interest. 
We didn’t have a real dog in that fight 
is what I am saying. 
In fact, Qadhafi did have blood on his 
hands. He wasn’t a good guy. But since 
the U.S. went into Iraq, he opened his 
doors and said: You tell me what weap-
ons I can keep. I won’t pursue nukes 
anymore. 
He had not been a problem for us 
from that time forward, yet President 
Obama, without any authority from 
here, decides basically to go to war 
with Libya and with Qadhafi and drop-
ping bombs on them. Why? Because he 
said NATO needs us to do this. 
Mr. PERRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. What I have heard on 
this House floor today is the President 
is capricious, irresponsible, doesn’t 
have a plan, doesn’t have a strategy. If 
the gentleman will please tell the audi-
ence, under the Obama administration 
and under Secretary Clinton, what was 
the strategy in Libya? 
Mr. GOHMERT. There was no strat-
egy in Libya other than to take out 
Qadhafi. Just like President Carter 
turning his back on the Shah and wel-
coming Ayatollah Khomeini in, when 
President Obama took out Qadhafi and, 
yes, he bombed him into oblivion. 
We have seen reports that Qadhafi 
was begging, look, we will just go into 
exile, and he sent word to the Presi-
dent, if you will just let me leave in 
peace, I won’t ever come back to Libya. 
Let’s leave the country not destroyed, 
stop the bombing, and I will just leave, 
but never heard back from Washington. 
The problem is that President Obama 
created a failed state in Libya, and it 
has been the source of destabilizing all 
of North Africa. I don’t know if there is 
any Member of Congress who has been 
allowed to have 21⁄2 hours with the head 
of intelligence in Egypt as I have, but 
Egypt is paying heavily for President 
Obama’s wrongheadedness in taking 
out Qadhafi and completely desta-
bilizing North Africa. 
Mr. PERRY. I wasn’t in Congress. I 
didn’t have the honor to be in Congress 
at that time. Maybe you were, or 
maybe you were more attuned to 
things, but I am just wondering, at 
that time, without a strategy, without 
a plan, firing on a sovereign nation, 
killing their leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Actually, President 
Obama had our forces, NATO forces, 
but they were American. They bombed 
his convoy as he was leaving Libya. 
That allowed the locals— 
Mr. PERRY. It facilitated, yes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Then he was assas-
sinated there. 
Mr. PERRY. So to make the correc-
tion 
absolutely 
clear, 
the 
United 
States did not kill the leader of Libya, 
but we helped facilitate it, in some re-
spects. 
Mr. GOHMERT. In criminal terms, he 
was certainly an accessory. He could 
not have been killed without President 
Obama’s help. 
Mr. PERRY. Because if you were 
present, did somebody in this House 
say that this President is reckless, 
that he is destabilizing the region, that 
we are assassinating or aiding and 
abetting the assassination of leaders of 
foreign countries? Was any of that oc-
curring in this House? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Yes, it was, but only 
on one side of the aisle, and that was 
this side because we were okay with 
President Obama defending Americans 
and American interests. But as Bob 
Gates said, that did not include Libya. 
Now, he walked that back some, but it 
was clear it was not in our vital inter-
ests. 
What really got me, though, is I am 
hearing so many people who were here 
back then. They didn’t offer one peep 
about the illegality of what President 
Obama was doing. Many of us did, but 
they didn’t say a word. And that was 
outside our interests. 
Killing Soleimani, that was pro-
tecting American lives. Going after Qa-
dhafi didn’t protect any American 
lives, and in fact, it has caused total 
disruption. 
Mr. PERRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Did we have an Author-
ization for Use of Military Force in 
Libya? 
Mr. GOHMERT. No. 
Mr. PERRY. Was Libya an American 
combat theater? 
Mr. GOHMERT. No. 
Mr. PERRY. So when our good col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
say that this was illegal and unconsti-
tutional, meanwhile knowing that the

Authorization of Use of Military Force, 
whether we agree with it or not it is in 
statute right now, in a combat theater 
where we are authorized to be by that 
AUMF, by votes of Congress, signed by 
a President, with an armed combatant 
who, by the way, as you probably 
know, is listed on the terrorist list by 
the United States and others and is not 
supposed to be out of Iran, his home 
country. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Right. 
Mr. PERRY. Yet, he was traveling to 
Syria and then through Iraq as a com-
batant and as a terrorist on the ter-
rorist list. What is the point of putting 
terrorists on the list if you are not 
going to do anything about the ter-
rorist on the list? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Back to Libya mo-
mentarily, what President Obama did 
cost 
American 
lives, 
including 
at 
Benghazi. If he doesn’t decide unilater-
ally whether NATO wanted it or not, 
he decided for America without any 
consent from Congress to go to war 
with Libya to take out their leader. It 
destabilized the country. It put Amer-
ican lives at risk that were not at that 
time, and it actually cost American 
lives. 
I have an article here, and I have 
seen on Facebook some comments, but 
an ‘‘Iranian American activist out-
raged by ‘propaganda machine’ glori-
fying Soleimani.’’ 
There are so many Iranians who are 
speaking up now going: What is wrong 
with you people? This guy was a ter-
rorist. He was killing Iranians. He was 
killing Americans. He was just merci-
less. 
Mr. PERRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. I just happened to no-
tice on CNN about the time of the at-
tack that they had the spokesperson 
for the Iranian Government during the 
hostage crisis speaking on CNN. NPR 
did something very similar. It is not 
just Iranian Americans who are un-
happy with the situation, the propa-
ganda not only by elected officials but 
by our media that is taking up the side 
of the enemy that wants to destroy 
America. It is disgusting. 
Mr. GOHMERT. It really is, and it is 
just a shame that at a time when we 
ought to come together because, unlike 
Libya, we do have an interest in pro-
tecting American lives. We do have an 
interest in stopping people who want to 
destroy America. We ought to be 
united on this. 
This is not a time to come in and try 
to condemn and belittle the President 
who did a good thing in taking out a 
terrorist. 
One other thing, I don’t remember 
anybody on the other side of the aisle 
here that made a peep when the Presi-
dent of the United States, President 
Obama, gave the order to kill al- 
Awlaki and his 16-year-old son. So al- 
Awlaki, he was an American citizen. 
Why, because his parents came over on 
a visa, a student visa, had him, took 
him back, and taught him to hate 
America, but he got an American pass-
port. He is an American citizen. 
He had worked with some in the 
Obama 
administration, 
apparently 
worked with some in the Bush adminis-
tration. But he was really an enemy of 
America. 
President Obama gave the order not 
to take out a terrorist like Soleimani, 
who was in the process of stirring up 
terrorism and killing Americans, but 
this was an American citizen, and he 
gave the order to take him out with a 
drone strike, take out his 16-year-old 
son. Regardless of what al-Awlaki had 
done, his son was not a criminal, but 
President Obama just ordered him 
taken out and not one word from the 
other side of the aisle. 
I would have thought we could have 
come together on that: Wait, before we 
take out American citizens, should we 
give them a trial or should we just let 
a President decide? 
Now, I was okay with somebody that 
they had the evidence and that was in 
the process of being at war with us, but 
for heaven’s sake, the people didn’t 
raise not one peep about that. 
Mr. PERRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Was there a briefing? 
Was there a consultation from the 
President to the leaders of Congress or 
to Congress? Was there adequate infor-
mation substantiating the imminence 
of an attack? Was there any of that, or 
was there any human outcry that there 
was none of that and then a rush to 
judgment on the President’s authority 
to do that from our good friends on the 
other side of the aisle? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Well, the media 
helped them out. This is just an incred-
ible time, and it is a time when free 
people ought to be able to come to-
gether and unite together in the cause 
of freedom. 
As Natan Sharansky pointed out, 
people didn’t think he and his wife 
would be getting back together after he 
was released from prison in Russia be-
cause she was more religious and he 
wasn’t, and he said that is ridiculous. I 
got along with the guy for 12 years in 
my cell, and the only thing we had in 
common was a desire for freedom. That 
ought to bring us together here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 116th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION

.
S99 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 2020 
No. 5 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Father, who extends daily to 
our lawmakers’ compassionate love, we 
praise Your Holy Name. In a fragile 
world where we often find ourselves 
waiting to exhale, You remain our 
shelter for every storm. 
Lord, relieve the shadows of gloom as 
we face a world endangered by selfish-
ness and sin. Bring our Senators from 
the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy 
of hope. Make their lives unflickering 
lights that scatter the darkness in our 
Nation and world. Give them an un-
flinching certainty that You are sov-
ereign. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute as in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
over the past year, the Iranian regime 
has been increasingly aggressive, at-
tacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, 
shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a 
British tanker, attacking a Saudi oil 
facility, attacking U.S. military bases 
in Iraq, and storming the U.S. Embassy 
in Baghdad. 
The U.S. response to Iran’s increas-
ing provocations had been too meas-
ured, to the point that we risked Iran’s 
leaders mistaking restraint on the part 
of America for weakness and encour-
aging further escalation. 
Another attack that risked many 
American lives was in the works when 
President Trump ordered U.S. forces to 
take out the terrorist mastermind of 
the Iranian regime. 
Now, think about it. Sometimes you 
have to stand up to a bully to get him 
to back off or else we might be inviting 
further aggression. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
first, this morning I want to associate 
myself with a statement made yester-
day by one of our distinguished col-
leagues about the House Democrats 
treating impeachment like a political 
toy. Here is what the Senator said: ‘‘If 
it’s serious and urgent, send them over. 
If it isn’t, don’t.’’ That was our Demo-
cratic colleague, the senior Senator 
from California, the ranking member 
of 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
She 
wasn’t alone. 
‘‘It’s time to get on with it.’’ That is 
our Democratic colleague the junior 
Senator from Delaware. 
‘‘At some point, it’s appropriate to 
send them and pass the baton to Sen-
ators.’’ That is our Democratic col-
league, the senior Senator from Con-
necticut. 
‘‘I think the time has past. She 
should send the articles.’’ That is our 
Democratic colleague the junior Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Now, this is a challenging time to 
create bipartisan agreement in the 
Senate on any subject, but the Speaker 
of the House has managed to do the im-
possible. She has created this growing 
bipartisan unity here in the Senate in 
opposition to her own reckless behav-
ior. 
The Senators may not agree on 
much, but it appears most of us still 
recognize the threat to our institution 
when we see one. Article I, section 3, 
says: ‘‘The Senate shall have the sole 
power to try all impeachments’’—pe-
riod. 
The House can begin the process, and 
Speaker PELOSI’s majority has cer-
tainly done that, but the Senate alone 
can resolve it. Yet, for weeks now, the 
House majority has blocked the Senate 
from fulfilling our constitutional duty. 
In a precedent-breaking display of par-
tisanship, the Speaker has refused to 
let her own allegations proceed nor-
mally to trial unless she gets to hand- 
design various elements of our Senate 
process. In other words, the House 
Democrats already spent 12 weeks un-
dermining the institution of the Presi-
dency with a historically unfair and 
subjective impeachment, and now, for a 
sequel, they have come after the insti-
tution of the Senate as well. That is 
where we are. 
The dwindling number of our Senate 
Democratic 
colleagues 
who 
remain 
complicit in this must realize what 
they are doing. Should future House 
majorities feel empowered to waste our 
time with junior varsity political hos-
tage situations? Should future Speak-
ers be permitted to conjure up this 
sword of Damocles at will and leave it 
hanging over the Senate unless we do 
what they say? Of course not. 
This week, a majority of the Senate 
stepped forward to make it perfectly 
clear that this conversation is over. A 
majority of this body has said defini-
tively that we are not ceding our con-
stitutional authority to the partisan 
designs of the Speaker. We will not let

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S100 
January 9, 2020 
the House extend its precedent-break-
ing spree over here to our Chamber. 
There will be no unfair new rule book 
written solely for President Trump. 
The basic organization of the first 
phase of this trial will track the phase 
one of the Clinton trial, which all 100 
Senators voted for in 1999. I have said 
for months that this is our preferred 
route. 
By the way, that is exactly what the 
American people want. Seventy-seven 
percent told a Harvard-Harris survey 
that the basic outline of a Clinton 
trial, reserving the witness question 
until later in the proceedings, ought to 
be good enough for this President as 
well. Fair is fair. In the same survey, 58 
percent of Americans said they want 
Speaker PELOSI to do her job and send 
the articles to the Senate rather than 
continue delaying. 
It makes sense that American fami-
lies have lost patience with this act 
just like we Senators have lost pa-
tience with it because this is not just 
some intramural tiff between the two 
Houses in our bicameral legislature. 
This recklessness affects our entire 
country. 
When you take a step back, what has 
really happened over the last 3 weeks? 
What has happened? When you take a 
step back from the political noise and 
the pundits discussing ‘‘leverage’’—by 
the way, that never existed—what have 
House Democrats actually done? 
This is what they have done. They 
have initiated one of the most grave 
and most unsettling processes in our 
Constitution and then refused to allow 
a resolution of it. The Speaker began 
something that she herself predicted 
would be ‘‘so divisive to the country,’’ 
and now she is unilaterally saying it 
cannot move forward to resolution. 
It is bad enough that House Demo-
crats gave in to the temptation of sub-
jective impeachment that every pre-
vious House for 230 years has managed 
to resist. However unwise, that is their 
constitutional prerogative. They get to 
start it, if they choose, but they do not 
get to declare that it can never be fin-
ished. They do not get to trap our en-
tire 
country 
into 
an 
unending 
‘‘Groundhog 
Day’’ 
of 
impeachment 
without resolution. 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
specifically 
warned against a procrastinated reso-
lution of impeachments. In part, that 
is because our duly-elected President 
deserves a verdict, just like every 
American who is accused by their gov-
ernment deserves a speedy trial. 
This goes deeper than fairness to one 
individual. This is about what is fair to 
the entire country. There is a reason 
why the Framers did not contemplate a 
permanently 
unsettled 
Presidency. 
That is true under any circumstances, 
but 
consider 
especially 
the 
cir-
cumstances of recent days. Even as the 
Democrats have prolonged this game, 
we have seen Iran escalate tensions 
with our Nation. We live in a dan-
gerous world. 
So, yes, the House majority can cre-
ate this temporary cloud over a Com-
mander in Chief if they choose—if they 
choose—but they do not get to keep 
the cloud in place forever. Look, there 
is real business for the American peo-
ple that the Senate needs to complete. 
If the Speaker continues to refuse to 
take her own accusations to trial, the 
Senate will move forward next week 
with the business of our people. We will 
operate on the assumption that House 
Democrats are too embarrassed—too 
embarrassed—to ever move forward, 
and we will get back to the people’s 
business. 
For example, the Senate continues to 
process President Trump’s landmark 
trade deal, the USMCA, through our 
committees of jurisdiction. It passed 
the Senate Finance Committee this 
week by a landslide vote of 25 to 3, a 
major victory for the President and for 
working families. Now our other com-
mittees will continue their consider-
ation. 
And there is more. The epidemic of 
opioids, fentanyl, and other substance 
abuse continues to plague our Nation. 
Some colleagues have signaled they 
may raise privileged resolutions on war 
powers. The Senate has plenty of seri-
ous work to do for our country. So 
while the Speaker continues her irre-
sponsible games, we will continue 
doing the people’s business.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
IRAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday the Senate received a classi-
fied briefing for all Senators from the 
Trump administration on the recent 
military operation that killed Iranian 
General Soleimani. Nearly the entire 
Senate attended, but only 15 Senators 
were able to ask questions before the 
administration decided they had to go. 
As many as 82 Senators were left hang-
ing in the balance without a chance to 
answer their questions. It was a sight 
like none I have ever seen in my time 
in the Senate. 
This is a crucial issue: war and peace. 
These were five of the leading people 
involved in the decision making, past, 
present and future. If they couldn’t 
stay to answer questions in a classified 
briefing, that is the ultimate disrespect 
to the Senate. 
I have to tell you, it was not just 
Democrats who were upset and not just 
on the Republican side. Senator PAUL 
and Senator LEE were upset. Four or 
five Senators came over to me, in that 
room, when I made the request that 
they come back, and said: Please count 
me in on that. 
As Secretary Pompeo was practically 
running out the door, I asked the 
White House representative if they 
would come back and finish the brief-
ing. Pompeo said no, on his behalf, but 
the White House representative assured 
me the group would be back in short 
order. 
I said: Within a week. 
In the room, in the SCIF, he said 
they will definitely come back. 
This morning, the White House told 
me they would explore coming back. 
They are already backing off, as usual. 
This is imperative. We are asking, in as 
polite a way as we can right now, 
Democrats and Republicans, that these 
five leaders—the head of DNI, the head 
of the CIA, the head of the Joint 
Chiefs, Secretary of Defense, and the 
Secretary of State—come before us 
within a week and answer the ques-
tions of the 82 Senators who were on 
the list and wanted to ask questions 
but couldn’t. 
The scene at yesterday’s briefing was 
unacceptable, as Members of both sides 
of the aisle have attested. Eighty-two 
Senators—chairs, 
ranking 
members, 
appropriators, 
authorized—were 
snubbed by this administration on a 
matter of war and peace. They must re-
turn. 
Again, this administration’s thwart-
ing of the exquisite balance the Found-
ing Fathers put in place between the 
Congress and Presidency is something 
that would make the Founding Fathers 
turn over in their graves and strikes at 
the core of what America is all about. 
Why is it important we have this 
briefing? Because the danger of war is 
still very real. There seems to be a 
sense that Iran’s missile strikes on 
U.S. installations in Iraq, which re-
sulted in no U.S. or coalition casual-
ties, was a signal that our hostilities 
between our two countries are dees-
calating. If that is true, it would cer-
tainly be a good thing, but we all know 
Iran has many different ways of caus-
ing trouble in the Middle East. Over

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S101 
January 9, 2020 
the last decade, Iranian proxies have 
exported terror, fomented civil strife 
throughout the region. We know they 
may seek to strike the United States 
in many new ways, like through cyber 
attacks. Undoubtedly, there is still a 
danger Iran will retaliate for the death 
of General Soleimani in other ways, 
not only in the next days, where it is 
possible they could, but in the next 
weeks and months. 
In a speech yesterday, the Iran Su-
preme Leader said the Iranian missile 
strike was just ‘‘one slap.’’ ‘‘Such mili-
tary actions,’’ he continued, ‘‘are not 
enough as far as the importance of re-
taliation is concerned.’’ We have good 
reason to worry that Iran will do more, 
particularly, given the fact that they 
are a regime that has many hard-liners 
who hate the United States and will 
try to do us as much damage as they 
can. For other reasons as well, the risk 
of confrontation with Iran has grown 
more acute, some of it because of 
President Trump’s actions. 
At the President’s order, we now 
have at least 15,000 additional U.S. 
forces in the Middle East—more forces 
than we had at the beginning of last 
summer—15,000 more. The Iranian pub-
lic, which only weeks ago was pro-
testing its own political leaders, has 
rallied behind the regime and is direct-
ing its entire ire at the United States. 
Iran has also announced that it will no 
longer abide by any restraints on its 
nuclear program that were imposed by 
the JCPOA, signaling its possible in-
tent to pursue a nuclear weapon. 
For all these reasons—that clearly 
Iran is still a great danger and the risk 
of war still looms—we need Senator 
KAINE’s War Powers Resolution more 
than ever. 
The President has made several er-
ratic and impulsive decisions when it 
comes to foreign policy that have made 
Americans less safe, put even more 
American forces in harm’s way. More 
American troops are now headed to the 
Middle East. We are not reducing our 
troop load; we are increasing it. 
Iran is no longer constrained by lim-
its on its nuclear program. We find our-
selves even more isolated from allies 
and partners around the world who are 
shaken by the recklessness and incon-
sistency of the administration’s foreign 
policy. The Trump administration can-
not even complete a congressional 
briefing. Congress, unequivocally, must 
hold the President accountable and as-
sert our authority over matters of war 
and peace. That is what Senator 
KAINE’s resolution would do. 
We will have a debate on the floor in 
the Senate. I urge my colleagues to 
support the Kaine resolution. There are 
many different ways we can make sure 
we don’t go into a war recklessly and 
without check. 
Senator SANDERS
today is intro-
ducing legislation, of which I am a co-
sponsor, that will hold back funding for 
such a war. We Democrats will con-
tinue to pursue ways to assert our con-
stitutional authority and make sure 
that before the administration takes 
any actions—because so many of their 
actions tend to be reckless and impul-
sive—they have to get the OK of Con-
gress. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Madam President, on impeachment, I 
have to respond to Leader MCCON-
NELL’s hyperbolic accusations that the 
Speaker is trying to dictate terms of 
the Senate trial. I know the Repub-
lican leader must be upset he cannot 
exert total control over this process, 
but Speaker PELOSI has done just the 
right thing. I can understand why 
Leader MCCONNELL is so frustrated. If 
the Speaker had sent the Articles of 
Impeachment over to the Senate im-
mediately after they passed, Senate 
Republicans could have moved to dis-
miss the articles. There was a lot of 
talk about that a while ago. There 
wouldn’t have been a fair or even a cur-
sory trial, and they might have even 
tried to dismiss the whole articles be-
fore Christmas. Instead, over the past 
few weeks, not only have they been 
prevented from doing that, there have 
been several crucial disclosures of evi-
dence that appear to further incrimi-
nate the President, each disclosure bol-
stering the arguments we Democrats 
have made for a trial that features the 
relevant 
witnesses 
and 
documents. 
That has been Speaker PELOSI’s focus 
from the very beginning and has been 
my focus from the very beginning: get-
ting a fair trial that considers the facts 
and only the facts. As I have said re-
peatedly on this Senate floor, as Joe 
Friday said in ‘‘Dragnet,’’ ‘‘Just the 
facts, ma’am.’’ 
The Speaker and I are in complete 
agreement on that point, and because 
the Republican leader has been unable 
to bring up the articles and dismiss 
them or stampede through a trial over 
the Christmas period, the focus of the 
country has been on witnesses and doc-
uments. 
Leader MCCONNELL
will do every-
thing he can to divert attention from 
that focus on witnesses and documents. 
He knows his Senators are under huge 
pressure not to just truncate a trial 
and have no evidence; that it will play 
very badly in America and back home 
in their States. He is a very clever fel-
low, so he doesn’t just say no. He says: 
Let’s delay this for a while and see 
what happens. 
I have little doubt most people who 
follow this—most Republicans probably 
quietly—have little doubt that Leader 
MCCONNELL
has no interest in wit-
nesses and documents, no interest in a 
fair trial. When we say ‘‘fair trial,’’ we 
mean facts; we mean witnesses; we 
mean documents. 
When the impeachment trial begins 
in the Senate, the issue will return to 
witnesses and documents. It has been 
out there all along but will come back 
even stronger. That question will not 
be decided, fortunately, just by Leader 
MCCONNELL. Every Senator will have 
to vote on that question. Those votes 
at the beginning of the trial will not be 
the last votes on witnesses and docu-
ments. Make no mistake, we will con-
tinue to revisit the issue because it is 
so important to our constitutional pre-
rogative to hold a fair impeachment 
trial. 
The American people believe, over-
whelmingly, and regardless of partisan 
affiliation, that the Senate should con-
duct a fair trial. A fair trial means 
that we get to hear the evidence, the 
facts, the truth. Every Presidential im-
peachment trial in history has featured 
witnesses and documents. The trial of 
the President should be no different. 
The Leader has accused the Speaker 
of making up her own rules. 
Mr. Leader, you are making up your 
own rules. Every trial has had wit-
nesses. Will you support this trial hav-
ing witnesses or are you making up 
your own rules to serve the President’s 
purpose of covering up? 
The argument in favor of witnesses is 
so strong and has such common sense 
behind it that my Republican col-
leagues cannot even argue against it on 
the merits. They can only say: We 
should punt the question. Maybe we 
will decide on that later, after both 
sides finish making their cases. 
As already explained over and over 
again, but it is worth repeating, that 
position makes no sense from a trial 
perspective. Have both sides finish 
their presentations and then vote on 
whether there should be evidence? The 
presentation should be based on evi-
dence, on witnesses, on documents. It 
should not be an afterthought. 
I say to my Republican colleagues, 
this strategy of voting on witnesses 
later lives on borrowed time. To re-
peat, once the trial begins, there will— 
there will be a vote about the question 
of witnesses and documents, and the 
spotlight will be on four Republican 
Senators, who at any point could join 
Democrats and form a majority in 
favor of witnesses and documents. Four 
Republicans could stand up and do the 
right thing. Four Republicans could 
make a difference between a fair trial 
and a coverup. Four Republicans could 
do what the Founding Fathers wanted 
us to do: hold a fair trial with all the 
facts. 
All Leader MCCONNELL can do right 
now is try to divert attention, call 
names—he is good at that—and delay 
the inevitable, but he can only delay it. 
Every single one of us in this Senate 
will have to take a stand. How do my 
Republican friends want the American 
people, their constituents, and history 
to remember them? We shall see. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
think it is safe to say that most Repub-
licans here in the Senate expect that at 
some point we will be receiving Arti-
cles of Impeachment from the House of 
Representatives, at which time we will 
conduct the Senate’s business. We will 
give the President a fair opportunity to 
be heard—something that was lacking 
in the House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S102 
January 9, 2020 
I heard the Democratic leader’s sug-
gestion that the reason the House had 
to sit on this is because if they sent 
this over to the Senate, somehow the 
Senate would dismiss this earlier, im-
mediately, or something along those 
lines. I have no idea where that comes 
from. That has never been the inten-
tion here for Republicans in the Sen-
ate. Republicans in the Senate know 
full well that we have a job to do under 
the Constitution in which we hear the 
case, hear the arguments, ask ques-
tions, and consider the possibility of 
additional evidence being presented. 
We have said all along that is how we 
intend to treat this. But we want to 
make sure it is a fair process—a proc-
ess that isn’t rushed, a process that 
isn’t partisan, as it was in the House of 
Representatives. 
We have gone so far as to suggest 
that the precedent to be used be the 
Clinton precedent—in other words, the 
precedent that was used during Presi-
dent Clinton’s impeachment process 
back in 1999. At that time, there were 
100 votes in the Senate—Republican 
and Democrat—supporting that par-
ticular process, which, as I pointed out, 
allows for both sides to make their ar-
guments. The managers in the House of 
Representatives come over and make 
their case, and the President and his 
team have an opportunity to respond 
to that, and then there is an oppor-
tunity for Senators to propound ques-
tions. It seems to me, at least, that is 
a fair process. 
So far, we haven’t seen the articles; 
nor have we seen any cooperation from 
the Senate Democrats about a process 
that would do all the things I just men-
tioned. So the Democratic leader’s sug-
gestion that they needed to wait all 
this time because they have to some-
how ensure that Republicans were not 
going to dismiss this is a false argu-
ment. 
I would argue that the House of Rep-
resentatives sitting on this and stall-
ing it undermines the very point they 
made about why it was so important 
that they do this. If they rush it, if 
they do not hear some of the witnesses, 
if they do not subpoena some of the 
witnesses—some of the very people 
they want the Senate to subpoena and 
hear from are people they could have 
subpoenaed and heard from. 
They have now evidently concluded 
that—while at one time ‘‘We just have 
to get this through because this Presi-
dent is such a clear and present danger 
to the country. We have to do this fast 
and do it with a sense of urgency,’’ 
now, all of a sudden, the brakes have 
been put on and for no apparent reason 
other than, I would argue, they see po-
litical advantage in doing that. 
But the fact is, the Senate will hear 
this at some point if we receive the ar-
ticles, and we will employ a process—a 
fair process—that allows both sides to 
make their arguments and to be heard. 
Then we will allow the Senate to do its 
will, and whatever 51 votes in the Sen-
ate decide is ultimately how this will 
be disposed of. 
I can tell you, contrary to the asser-
tions of the Democrats, I believe people 
across this country are very weary and 
tired—frankly, 
in 
some 
ways 
ex-
hausted—from having this thing just 
drag on. There are so many important 
issues we need to deal with. 
We have a trade agreement that is 
teed up and ready to go—I hope we can 
vote on it here in the Senate—that has 
real relevance to the American people. 
There are farmers and ranchers in my 
State of South Dakota and across this 
country who desperately need to ex-
pand and open markets. We have de-
pressed ag prices and low commodity 
prices in both grains and livestock, and 
we need to create opportunities for 
these farmers to get back on their feet 
and to restore profitability. 
Instead of doing that, we are waiting 
for the Articles of Impeachment to 
come here. Assuming that they do, we 
will spend who knows how long on 
processing that at a time when there 
are so many pressing needs the Amer-
ican people care deeply about, not to 
mention the fact that in November of 
this year, we will have a Presidential 
election and congressional elections, 
where the people of this country can 
weigh in. They can have their voices 
heard. 
That is how we ought to decide the 
differences we have in this country. If 
you have a difference with the Presi-
dent of the United States, you will 
have an opportunity to go vote in No-
vember of this year. If you decide you 
don’t like him and you want to vote 
him out of office, you can do that. That 
is where the people believe this ought 
to be decided, not through a long, 
drawn-out, protracted process here in 
Washington, DC, where a bunch of 
Members of Congress, who should be 
working on important issues like en-
ergy, healthcare, economy, jobs and 
wages, and things like that, are bogged 
down with this impeachment process. 
I believe the American people are 
weary. I think they know that starting 
in about 3 weeks in Iowa, they are 
going to start voting. We have a Presi-
dential election that is underway, and 
it seems to me that people who have 
views they want to express can make 
their voices heard in the election, rath-
er than having a long, drawn-out im-
peachment process, which, as I said 
earlier, the House of Representatives 
initiated in such a hurried way that 
they came up with some pretty weak 
tea-type Articles of Impeachment in a 
rush to try to get it over here. Now 
they are stalling it and not delivering 
it. 
The Senate is not going to act, obvi-
ously, until the House acts and sends 
over those articles. When they do, we 
will ensure that, unlike the way they 
conducted themselves in the House of 
Representatives, it is a fair process 
that gives the President of the United 
States, who has been attacked through 
this process, a chance to respond and 
defend himself. 
TRACED ACT 
Madam President, it is safe to say 
that pretty much every American has 
been subjected to annoying and illegal 
robocalls. Who hasn’t picked up the 
phone to discover it is an automated 
message telling you that you have won 
a trip to the Bahamas, which you can 
secure by passing along your credit 
card information, or asking for impor-
tant banking information so your ac-
count won’t be closed? 
These calls are a major nuisance, and 
too often they are more than a nui-
sance. Every day, vulnerable Ameri-
cans fall prey to ever more sophisti-
cated scammers and have money or 
their identities stolen. Individuals who 
fall prey to scammers 
can 
spend 
months or years struggling to get their 
lives back. 
I have been working on the issue of 
robocalls for several years now, first as 
chairman of the Senate Commerce 
Committee and now as chairman of the 
Commerce Subcommittee on Commu-
nications, Technology, Innovation, and 
the Internet. 
I worked with Senator MARKEY to 
lobby the Federal Communications 
Commission to create a single, com-
prehensive database of reassigned tele-
phone numbers so that legal callers 
could avoid contacting people who 
hadn’t signed up for messages. 
I have spent a lot of time examining 
ways to discourage illegal robocalling. 
While Commerce Committee chairman, 
I held a hearing with notorious mass 
robocaller Adrian Abramovich. His tes-
timony made clear that current pen-
alties for illegal robocallers were not 
sufficient. Illegal robocallers have been 
building the cost of fines into their ac-
tivities, and so far, there has been no 
effective mechanism for criminal pros-
ecution. 
Based upon Abramovich’s testimony 
and testimony from Federal enforcers, 
I developed the Telephone Robocall 
Abuse Criminal Enforcement and De-
terrence Act, or what we call the 
TRACED Act, along with Senator MAR-
KEY. At the end of December, the Presi-
dent signed our bill into law. The 
TRACED Act provides tools to discour-
age 
illegal 
robocalls, 
protect 
con-
sumers, and crack down on offenders. 
As I mentioned earlier, criminal 
prosecution of illegal robocallers can 
be difficult. Scammers are frequently 
based abroad and can quickly shut 
down shop before authorities can get to 
them. I believe we need to make sure 
there is a credible threat of criminal 
prosecution and prison for those who 
use robocalls to prey upon the elderly 
and other vulnerable Americans. To 
that end, the TRACED Act convenes a 
working group with representatives 
from the Department of Justice, the 
Federal Communications Commission, 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, State attorneys general, and oth-
ers to identify ways to criminally pros-
ecute illegal robocalling. 
In the meantime, it expands the win-
dow in which the Federal Communica-
tions 
Commission 
can 
pursue

scammers and levy fines from 1 year to 
4 years. The bill also makes it easier 
for your cell phone carrier to lawfully 
block calls that aren’t properly au-
thenticated, which will ultimately help 
stop scammers from getting through to 
your phone. The TRACED Act also 
tackles the issue of spoofed calls— 
where scammers make the call appear 
as if it is coming from a known num-
ber. TRACED addresses the issue of 
one-ring scams, where international 
scammers try to get individuals to re-
turn their calls so they can charge 
them exorbitant fees. 
The bill directs the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to convene a 
working group to address the problem 
of illegal robocalls being made to hos-
pitals. There are too many stories of 
hospital telephone lines being flooded 
with robocalls, disrupting critical lines 
of communication for hours. 
Will the TRACED Act completely 
solve the problem of illegal robocalls? 
No. But it will go a long way toward 
making it safe to answer your phone 
again, and it will help ensure those 
who exploit vulnerable individuals face 
punishment for their actions. 
I am grateful to Senator MARKEY for 
partnering with me on this legislation. 
The 
Washington 
Post 
praised 
the 
TRACED Act as an example of ‘‘good 
old-fashioned legislating.’’ 
I am proud of the strong bipartisan 
support it received in both Houses of 
Congress. I look forward to monitoring 
the implementation of the TRACED 
Act and continuing to work to protect 
Americans from illegal and abusive 
robocalls. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
JOHNSON and I be able to complete our 
remarks prior to the cloture vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF PAUL J. RAY 
Mr. 
PETERS. 
Madam 
President, 
today I rise to speak in opposition to 
the nomination of Paul Ray to be the 
next Administrator of the Office of In-
formation 
and 
Regulatory 
Affairs, 
more commonly known as OIRA. 
Although not many people outside of 
Washington have heard of OIRA, this 
office wields an important amount of 
influence over regulations that impact 
families, businesses, and communities 
in countless ways. 
If confirmed, Mr. Ray would be re-
sponsible for reviewing health, labor, 
environmental, and many other protec-
tions, from safeguarding our source of 
drinking water to ensuring the cars we 
drive are safe. 
In Michigan, communities like Flint, 
Oscoda, and Parchment cannot drink 
water from their own faucets without 
fear of ingesting toxic chemicals like 
lead or PFAS. 
When meeting with Mr. Ray, I 
stressed the need to prioritize protec-
tions that provide safe and clean drink-
ing water and preserve our Great Lakes 
and other natural resources. I appre-
ciate that Mr. Ray listened to my con-
cerns. He is clearly very smart and pas-
sionate about administrative law and 
the rulemaking process. However, Mr. 
Ray is relatively new to Federal serv-
ice and has relied primarily on his re-
cent tenure at the agency to dem-
onstrate his qualifications. 
Given his prior role, the best way for 
us to understand what Mr. Ray will do 
if confirmed is to take a closer look at 
what he has already done. In order to 
thoroughly examine his qualifications, 
we asked Mr. Ray to provide informa-
tion about his tenure, which included 
reviews of proposals that would weaken 
critical protections for workers, vet-
erans, children, disadvantaged commu-
nities, and the environment. 
Unfortunately, the nominee and the 
agency’s Office of General Counsel 
have refused to meaningfully respond 
to committee members’ request for in-
formation or fully participate in the 
Senate’s efforts to meet our constitu-
tional responsibilities. While Mr. Ray 
expressed a commitment to trans-
parency, his inability to ensure compli-
ance with the committee’s requests— 
including for material that is routinely 
provided to the public in response to 
the Freedom of Information Act— 
raises serious doubts about whether he 
will cooperate with Congress if con-
firmed. 
Given 
the 
unprecedented 
actions 
taken by this administration to roll 
back safeguards, it would be irrespon-
sible to confirm Mr. Ray to OIRA with-
out 
an 
opportunity 
to 
thoroughly 
evaluate his record. I have sought to 
carefully consider Mr. Ray’s nomina-
tion, but due to this serious lack of 
transparency, I cannot support his con-
firmation. For that reason, I will be 
voting no, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise 
to ask the Senate to confirm the nomi-
nation of Paul Ray to be the Adminis-
trator for the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs of the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
OIRA, as this office is commonly 
called, is the Federal Government’s 
principal authority for reviewing exec-
utive branch regulations, approving 
government information collections, 
and overseeing the implementation of 
government-wide policies related to in-
formation policy, privacy, and statis-
tical practices. The OIRA Adminis-
trator is responsible for reviewing and 
approving both rules and then final 
rules to ensure agencies conduct appro-
priate cost-benefit analyses. 
Under President Trump, OIRA has 
conducted between 200 and 400 rule re-
views each year, and it has made it an 
administrative priority to reduce the 
regulations and to control regulatory 
costs. That includes the important 
work of reviewing existing regulations 
to identify those that are outdated, 
harmful, 
or 
counterproductive 
and 
achieving this administration’s initial 
goal of eliminating at least two regula-
tions for every significant new one 
added. 
The good news for our economy is 
that the administration far exceeded 
this initial goal by eliminating 22 out-
dated or harmful regulations for every 
new one added in 2017, and it has 
achieved a rate of 71⁄2 regulations re-
moved for each new regulation over the 
course of the administration. This has 
saved American families and busi-
nesses billions of dollars in compliance 
costs and has allowed businesses to 
spend that money and concentrate 
their efforts on growing their busi-
nesses and creating new products, serv-
ices, and good-paying jobs. 
I continue to believe this administra-
tion’s dedication to regulatory reform 
and reduction is the single most impor-
tant factor in the success of our econ-
omy, record low levels of unemploy-
ment, and growing wage levels, with 
wage growth being at its strongest at 
the lower end of our income spectrum. 
It is important to note that Mr. Ray 
has already played a key role in this 
regulatory rationalization and its re-
sulting economic success. 
In his having previously led OIRA as 
its Acting Administrator and as its As-
sociate Administrator, Mr. Ray has 
demonstrated the ability to carry out 
the office’s multifaceted mission. In 
addition to his direct leadership experi-
ence at OIRA, he currently serves as 
the Senior Adviser to the Director of 
Regulatory Affairs, where he advises 
on regulations and the regulatory proc-
ess. He also served as counselor to the 
Secretary of Labor, where he had a 
similar role. 
Prior to these public service roles, 
Mr. Ray was an associate at Sidley 
Austin LLP, and he served as a law 
clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sam-
uel Alito, as well as to Judge Debra 
Livingston of the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit. Mr. 
Ray graduated magna cum laude from 
Hillsdale College and Harvard Law 
School. 
Because of his background and dem-
onstrated enthusiasm for dealing with 
regulatory matters, Mr. Ray is unique-
ly qualified to serve as the next OIRA 
Administrator. I am grateful to Mr. 
Ray for his willingness to serve, and I 
strongly encourage my colleagues to 
vote yes on his confirmation. 
I yield the floor.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has 
now been more than 3 weeks since the 
House passed two Articles of Impeach-
ment against the President of the 
United States. It was a big day for 
them at the time and one they have 
been dreaming of and speaking of since 
the President was inaugurated nearly 3 
years ago. 
For as long as the House Democrats 
have been wanting to impeach the 
President, they spent only a short time 
on the impeachment inquiry itself. As 
a matter of fact, they rushed headlong 
into the impeachment process, and now 
they are trying to make up for the mis-
takes 
that 
Chairman 
SCHIFF
and 
Speaker PELOSI made when proceeding 
in the first place. 
For example, now they want to reliti-
gate things like executive privilege and 
whether the testimony of other wit-
nesses should be included in the Senate 
impeachment trial. In other words, the 
House wants to tell the Senate how to 
conduct the trial. 
Well, the House had its job to do— 
and, frankly, I think mishandled it— 
but now they have no say in the way 
the Senate conducts the impeachment 
trial, when and if Speaker PELOSI de-
cides to send the articles over here. 
Twelve weeks was all it took for House 
Democrats to come up with what they 
believed was enough evidence to war-
rant a vote on Articles of Impeach-
ment. I think they are experiencing 
some buyers’ remorse. During that 12 
weeks, we repeatedly heard House 
Democrats say how urgent the matter 
was, seemingly using urgency as an ex-
cuse for the slapdash investigation 
that they did and that they now regret. 
When the House concluded their rushed 
investigation and passed two Articles 
of Impeachment, we expected those ar-
ticles to be sent to the Senate prompt-
ly. 
This will be only the third time in 
American history where the Senate has 
actually convened a trial on Articles of 
Impeachment, so this is kind of a new, 
novel process for most of us here in the 
Senate. I think there are only 15 Sen-
ators who were here during the last im-
peachment trial of President Bill Clin-
ton. Most of us are trying to get up to 
speed and figure out how to discharge 
our duty under the Constitution as a 
jury that will decide whether to con-
vict or acquit and, if convicted, wheth-
er the President should be removed. 
This is serious. 
Here we are, about 11 months before 
the next general election. It strikes me 
as a serious matter to ask 535 Members 
of the U.S. Congress to remove a Presi-
dent who was voted into office with 
about 63 million votes. This is very se-
rious. 
Well, despite the House leadership 
and Members stating time and again 
before the Christmas holidays how 
pressing the matter of impeachment 
was, there hasn’t been an inch of move-
ment in the House since those Articles 
of Impeachment were voted on. Here 
we are, more than 3 weeks later, and 
Speaker PELOSI is still playing her cat- 
and-mouse game with these Articles of 
Impeachment. 
Last night, the Speaker appeared to 
have dug in her heels even deeper when 
she sent a letter to our Democratic col-
leagues about the delay. Following the 
majority leader’s announcement that 
every 
Republican 
Senator 
supports 
using exactly the same framework that 
was used during the Clinton impeach-
ment trial, the Speaker, as you might 
imagine, was not particularly happy 
because her gambit obviously didn’t 
work. She has zero leverage and zero 
right to try to dictate to the Senate 
how we conduct the Senate trial, just 
as we had zero leverage and zero input 
into how the House conducted its re-
sponsibilities. 
Speaker PELOSI told her caucus that 
the process is both unfair and ‘‘de-
signed to deprive Senators and the 
American people of crucial documents 
and testimony.’’ Clearly, she doesn’t 
think those documents and testimony 
were crucial enough to be included in 
the House investigation in the first 
place, but I digress. 
The Speaker is trying to make the 
most out of a very bad situation of her 
own creation and intentionally trying 
to mislead the American people into 
thinking this framework prevents any 
witnesses from testifying, which is a 
false impression. It is demonstrably 
false. These are the same parameters 
that guided the Clinton impeachment 
process, during which witnesses were 
presented by deposition, giving sworn 
testimony that was then presented by 
the parties. 
In 1999, 100 Senators agreed to this 
model. You would think if this was fair 
enough for President Clinton, it would 
be fair enough for President Trump. To 
apply a different standard would be 
just that—a double standard. 
All 100 Senators agreed during the 
Clinton impeachment trial to allow the 
impeachment 
managers 
to 
present 
their case, to allow the President’s 
lawyers to present their case, and then 
to permit the Senators to ask ques-
tions through the Chief Justice and to 
get additional information, and then— 
and only then—decide whether addi-
tional witnesses would be required. 
Under the Clinton model, and now 
under the model that will be used—the 
Clinton model that we will be using in 
the Trump impeachment trial—if Mem-
bers felt like they needed more infor-
mation, they could vote to hear from 
additional witnesses. That opportunity 
is still available to them under the 
Clinton precedent that will be applied 
in the Trump impeachment trial. That 
is exactly what happened in the Clin-
ton impeachment trial. After the argu-
ments and evidence were presented, 
Senators voted to hear from three addi-
tional witnesses who were then deposed 
and whose sworn testimony was then 
offered. 
You know, it makes me a little crazy 
when people say that this is a question

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S105 
January 9, 2020 
of witnesses or no witnesses. There 
were about 17 witnesses, as I count 
them, who testified in the House im-
peachment inquiry. All of that evi-
dence, such as it is, is available to the 
impeachment managers to offer here in 
the Senate. If, in fact, the Senate de-
cides to do as the Senate did in the 
Clinton impeachment, authorize sub-
poenas for three additional witnesses 
or more, that still is the Senate’s pre-
rogative, which is not foreclosed in the 
least by this resolution. 
Well, the Intelligence Committee 
alone held 7 public hearings with 12 
witnesses that totaled more than 30 
hours. Presumably, they are proud of 
the product—the evidence—that was 
produced during the course of those 
hearings or else they wouldn’t have 
conducted them in the first place. This 
isn’t a matter of witnesses or no wit-
nesses, as some of our Democratic col-
leagues and the media attempts to 
characterize it; this is a matter of let-
ting the parties to the impeachment 
decide how to try their case. 
I had the great honor, over a period 
of 13 years, to serve as a State court 
judge. I presided over hundreds of jury 
trials during the course of my experi-
ence as a district judge. Never have I 
seen a model where the jury decides 
how to try the case. The jury sits there 
and listens to the evidence presented 
by the parties, and that is exactly what 
we are proposing here. So this idea of 
letting Senators decide how to try the 
impeachment managers’ case or the 
President’s case is something totally 
novel and unheard of. 
Setting the rules on whom we hear 
from, when, and how—as the Speaker 
wants to do—on the front end makes no 
sense. Let me try an analogy. It would 
be like asking an NFL coach to outline 
every play in the Super Bowl—in 
order—before the game actually starts. 
Well, that is not possible. Having this 
discussion over Speaker PELOSI’s de-
mands on witnesses completely ignores 
the fact that this is simply not her pre-
rogative. 
Now, I know the Speaker is a power-
ful political figure. She rules the House 
with an iron fist, but her views simply 
have no weight whatsoever, in terms of 
how the Senate conducts its business, 
including an impeachment trial under 
the Constitution. 
This has all been diversion and, 
frankly, a lot of dissembling and mis-
leading arguments about things that 
just simply aren’t true. The Constitu-
tion outlines a bicameral impeachment 
process, with each Chamber having its 
separate and independent responsibil-
ities. 
As I said, just as the Constitution 
gives the House ‘‘the sole power of im-
peachment’’—that is a quote from the 
Constitution—it also gives the Senate 
‘‘the sole power to try all impeach-
ments.’’ Nowhere is found a clause 
granting the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives supreme authority to 
decide this process. Yes, she has been 
very influential leading up to the vote 
of the Articles of Impeachment, over 
which the Senate had no voice and no 
vote. Now her job is done, such as it is, 
but for sending the Articles of Im-
peachment to the Senate. 
Speaker PELOSI’s refusal to transmit 
the articles unless her demands are 
met is a violation of the separation of 
powers, and it is an unprecedented 
power grab. I must say, I have some 
sympathy with the Speaker’s position. 
Last March, she said that impeach-
ment was a bad idea because it was so 
divisive, and unless the evidence was 
compelling and the support for the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment was bipartisan, 
it wasn’t worth it. Well, that was in 
March 
of 
2019. 
Obviously, 
things 
changed, and the best I can tell is she 
was essentially forced by the radical 
Members of the House Democratic Cau-
cus to change her position, and now she 
finds herself in an embarrassingly un-
tenable and unsustainable position. 
This isn’t entirely her fault. 
While she has been playing games, 
though, with the Articles of Impeach-
ment, she has been infringing, I be-
lieve, on the President’s constitutional 
right to due process of law. Due process 
is based on the fundamental notions of 
fairness. That is what we accord every-
body in a civil or criminal proceeding— 
due process of law. The Sixth Amend-
ment, for example, guarantees the 
right to a speedy trial for every Amer-
ican, and it doesn’t exempt certain 
cases no matter how high- or low-pro-
file they may be. Now, while the Sixth 
Amendment right to a speedy trial 
may not, strictly speaking, apply to an 
impeachment trial because this isn’t a 
civil or criminal case, the whole funda-
mental notion of fairness does apply: a 
right to a speedy trial. 
It is clear that while Speaker PELOSI 
dangles these Articles of Impeachment 
over the President like a sword of 
Damocles, this is not fair to the Presi-
dent. It is not fair to the Senate. It is 
not fair, most importantly, to the 
American people. This distraction— 
this 
impeachment 
mania—has 
con-
sumed so much oxygen and attention 
here in Washington, DC, that it has 
prevented us from doing other things 
we know we can and should be doing 
that would benefit the American peo-
ple. 
I came here on two occasions to offer 
a piece of bipartisan legislation that 
would lower out-of-pocket costs for 
prescription drugs by eliminating some 
of the gamesmanship in the patent sys-
tem, only to find—even though it is a 
bipartisan bill, voted unanimously out 
of the Judiciary Committee—that the 
only person who objected to us taking 
it up and passing it was the Demo-
cratic minority leader. Those are the 
sort of games that, unfortunately, give 
Washington and Congress a bad name 
and a bad reputation. 
I must say this is not just this side of 
the aisle that thinks the time is up for 
Speaker PELOSI to send the Articles of 
Impeachment over here. There is bipar-
tisan agreement here in the Senate 
that it is time to fish or cut bait. 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s 
California 
col-
league, our friend, Senator FEINSTEIN 
from California, said: 
If we’re going to do it, she should send 
them over. I don’t see what good delay does. 
Well, good for Senator FEINSTEIN. 
Our friend and colleague from Con-
necticut, Senator BLUMENTHAL, said: 
We are reaching a point where the articles 
of impeachment should be sent. 
Senator MURPHY, his colleague from 
Connecticut, said: 
I think the time has passed. She should 
send the articles over. 
I think we all share the sentiment 
expressed by Senator ANGUS KING from 
Maine. He said: 
I do think we need to get this thing going. 
He has a gift for understatement. 
It is high time for the Speaker to 
quit using these Articles of Impeach-
ment as a way to pander to the most 
radical fringes of her party. The Mem-
bers of the House have completed their 
constitutional 
role. 
They 
launched 
their inquiry. They did their investiga-
tion, such as it was, and they held a 
partisan vote. That is their preroga-
tive. I don’t agree with it, but that is 
their prerogative, and they have done 
it. The Speaker should send the Arti-
cles of Impeachment to the Senate 
without further delay so we can per-
form our responsibilities under the 
Constitution in a trial. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an 
interesting time. I was thinking that 
over the holiday break. I was home, 
and I talked to many Vermonters. 
These are Vermonters who are Repub-
licans, Democrats, Independents, and 
across the political spectrum. All of 
them expressed concerns about how the 
Senate will handle the impeachment of 
President Trump or the trial. He has 
been impeached, but now it is the trial. 
I suspect that all 100 Senators had 
similar conversations. 
I have been asked not just about 
President Trump’s actions in Ukraine 
but also about how the Senate will con-
duct a trial and whether the Senate is 
even capable of holding a genuine, fair 
trial worthy of our constitutional re-
sponsibilities. 
I would remind Senators that at the 
start of an impeachment trial, we each 
swear an oath to do impartial justice 
according to the Constitution and laws. 
During my 45 years in this Chamber, I 
have taken this oath six times, and I 
take this oath extraordinarily seri-
ously. But I fear the Senate may be on 
the verge of abandoning what this oath 
means. 
The majority leader has vowed a 
quick acquittal before we hear any wit-
nesses. He has boasted that he is ‘‘not 
an impartial juror,’’ and he has pledged 
‘‘there will be no difference between 
the President’s position and our posi-
tion as to how to handle this.’’ He ig-
nores the fact that the U.S. Senate is a 
separate and independent body. Actu-
ally, what the majority leader said is

tantamount to a criminal defendant 
being allowed to set the rules for his 
own trial, while the judge and jury 
promise him a quick acquittal. That is 
a far cry from the ‘‘impartial justice’’ 
required by our oaths and the U.S. Con-
stitution. 
Given this, I understand why Speaker 
PELOSI did not rush to send the Arti-
cles of Impeachment to the Senate. A 
sham trial is in no one’s interest. I 
would say a sham trial is not even in 
the 
President’s 
interest. 
A 
choreographed acquittal exonerates no 
one. It serves only to deepen rifts with-
in the country, and eviscerates the 
Senate’s constitutional role. 
Now, how the Senate conducts the 
trial will be up to each of us. It is not 
up to one or two Senators, and it is cer-
tainly not up to the President. The du-
ration and scope of the trial, including 
whether to call witnesses or compel 
document production, will be decided 
by a simple majority of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I know many on the Republican side 
have said we should postpone any 
agreement on witnesses. They argue 
that the Senate did that for President 
Clinton’s trial, so why not now. That 
argument sounds reasonable—until you 
look at the facts. You know, facts are 
always troublesome things. 
Today, following President Trump’s 
instruction, nine key witnesses—key 
witnesses—with firsthand knowledge of 
the allegations have refused to cooper-
ate with the House investigation. Be-
cause of President Trump, they are 
told they are not allowed to testify. 
Now, compare that to the Clinton trial. 
Then, every key witness, including 
President Clinton, provided testimony 
under oath before the trial. Indeed, we 
had a massive record from the inde-
pendent counsel to consider: 36 boxes of 
material covering the most intimate 
details of the President’s life. Just 
think of that, every witness testifying, 
as compared to the Trump impeach-
ment, where he wouldn’t allow any key 
witness to testify, and even though he 
said he wanted to testify, of course he 
never did. 
Now, even with all that, even with 
those 36 boxes of material, the Senate 
did end up hearing from three wit-
nesses during the Clinton trial. Let me 
tell you how that worked. These are 
three witnesses who already had given 
extensive, voluminous testimony: Sid-
ney Blumenthal, he testified before the 
grand jury for three days; Vernon Jor-
dan, he testified before the grand jury 
for five days and was deposed by inde-
pendent counsel; and Monica Lewinsky 
had testified for two days before the 
grand jury, was deposed by independent 
counsel, and was interviewed by the 
independent counsel 20 times. 
Let’s be clear: Even Republicans, at 
the time, acknowledged they did not 
expect to learn new information from 
these witnesses. I know that Repub-
licans and Democrats picked a small 
group of Senators to be there for their 
depositions. I was one of them. In fact, 
I presided over the Lewinsky deposi-
tion. One of the House managers—Re-
publican managers—said that ‘‘if [the 
witnesses] are consistent, they’ll say 
the same that’s in here,’’ referring to 
their previous testimony already be-
fore the Senate. Another told Ms. 
Lewinsky: ‘‘Obviously, you testified ex-
tensively in the grand jury, so you’re 
going 
to 
obviously 
repeat 
things 
today.’’ And the third House manager 
told Mr. Jordan, ‘‘I know that probably 
about every question that could be 
asked has been asked’’—and, I might 
say, answered. 
And indeed those Republicans were 
correct. We did not learn anything ma-
terial from these depositions. 
Now, unlike the claims made on the 
other side, the situation today could 
not be more different. The Senate does 
not have any prior testimony or docu-
ments from four key witnesses: John 
Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, 
and Michael Duffey—all people who 
have 
significant 
information 
about 
what Donald Trump has been charged 
with. We don’t have a single document. 
We don’t have a single amount of testi-
mony under oath. Why? Because the 
President directed them not to cooper-
ate with the House, not to testify 
under oath, and not to say anything. If 
these witnesses had performed their 
legal duty, having been subpoenaed, 
and if they had cooperated with the 
House’s inquiry, we wouldn’t be in this 
position. 
There is no question that all Sen-
ators—Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
alike—will benefit from hearing what 
those witnesses have to say. All of 
them have direct and relevant informa-
tion about President Trump’s actions 
with respect to Ukraine. There is no 
good reason to postpone their testi-
mony. 
Take just one, the President’s former 
National 
Security 
Advisor, 
John 
Bolton. My question for all the Sen-
ators is this: We already know that, ac-
cording to Mr. Bolton’s lawyer, ‘‘he 
was personally involved in many of the 
events, meetings, and conversations 
. . . that have not yet been discussed in 
the testimonies thus far.’’ We already 
know that includes a one-on-one con-
versation with the President about 
Ukraine aid. We already know that Mr. 
Bolton described the President’s aide’s 
efforts as ‘‘a drug deal.’’ And we now 
know that Mr. Bolton is willing to talk 
to us for the first time if asked. How 
can we say we are fulfilling our con-
stitutional duty if we don’t even ask? 
How can we ignore such critical, first-
hand testimony? 
No matter how each side ultimately 
votes on guilt or innocence, the deci-
sion of whether to keep both the Sen-
ate and the American people in the 
dark would effectively make the Sen-
ate complicit in a cover-up. That would 
fall on the Senate, and that will shape 
our system of checks and balances for 
decades to come. It will haunt both 
Democrats and Republicans. Senate 
Republicans must not close the Sen-
ate’s eyes and cover its ears. We should 
be Senators. We should follow our oath 
to uphold justice. 
I recognize, of course, that this is an 
era of deep partisan acrimony. But 
that was true during the Clinton im-
peachment trial, and it was true during 
the Johnson impeachment trial. The 
question that each of us has to answer 
now is whether we will allow the label 
of Democrat or Republican to matter 
more than our constitutional role as 
Senators. We are first and foremost 
U.S. Senators. There are only 100 of us 
to represent over 300 million Ameri-
cans. That is why I believe the Senate 
itself is now on trial. 
I have never seen a trial without wit-
nesses when the facts are in dispute. I 
have tried many, many, many cases, 
both in private practice and as a pros-
ecutor. I have never tried a case where 
there are no witnesses. More to the 
point, the Senate has never held a 
Presidential impeachment trial with-
out hearing from witnesses. The Senate 
and the American people deserve, to 
have the full story. We shouldn’t be 
complicit in a cover-up. 
I would not suggest to any Senator 
that his or her oath requires at this 
time a specific verdict—that is going to 
depend on the trial. But I strongly be-
lieve that our oath requires that all 
Senators behave impartially and that 
all Senators support a fair trial, one 
that places the pursuit of truth above 
fealty to this or any other President, 
setting the rules for the time to come. 
The Senate has a job to do. It is not 
to rig the trial in favor of—or against— 
President Trump. Impeachment is the 
only constitutional mechanism that 
Congress has to hold Presidents ac-
countable. Whether or not the Senate 
ultimately votes to convict, if the Sen-
ate first enables a cover-up with a 
sham trial, then it means it is placing 
one President above the Constitution. 
In doing so, the Senate would evis-
cerate a foundation of our democracy 
that has thus far survived 240 years. No 
one—no one—is above the law. 
I see other Senators waiting to 
speak. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER

IRAN 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, a 
President of the United States is sum-
moned by his or her national security 
team and informed that he or she has a 
limited 
window 
of 
opportunity 
in 
which to potentially prevent an attack 
that could cost the lives of dozens, if 
not hundreds, of Americans or U.S. 
troops. They are advised this by their 
national 
security 
team—the 
entire 
team—in unanimity. What would you 
do? 
That is the most fundamental and 
difficult question that should be asked 
of anyone who seeks the Office of the 
Presidency. It is one of the most im-
portant things we need to know about 
those who seek the office and those 
who occupy it. It is the proverbial ‘‘3 
a.m. call.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S107 
January 9, 2020 
It also happens to describe the choice 
before President Trump a few days ago. 
You wouldn’t know that from listening 
to some of the rhetoric I see on tele-
vision. The Speaker of the House just 
held a press conference in which the 
messaging implies that the strike on 
the terrorist, Soleimani, was the act of 
a reckless madman—a reckless and ir-
responsible escalation. The alternative 
argument is that, by the way, he 
should have consulted with us before 
doing it. 
I reiterate: The entire national secu-
rity team of the President, including 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen-
eral Milley, has been unequivocal, both 
privately and publicly, that he agreed 
with the assessment and he believed 
that this strike was necessary in order 
to protect the lives of Americans from 
a near-term attack. 
I want to be frank. Anyone who left 
a briefing or goes around saying: Well, 
I don’t think that that was true, frank-
ly, is not questioning the President. 
They are questioning the 40 years of 
military service that General Milley 
has rendered this Nation and, frankly, 
questioning the judgment of the entire 
national security apparatus—all of the 
leadership of the national apparatus— 
of the United States of America. That 
question has been clearly answered by 
them. 
It is interesting, too, that had the 
President not acted and, God forbid, 
American lives had been lost, we could 
very easily have been here this week 
talking about how the President should 
be removed. There would be a third ar-
ticle of impeachment for refusing to 
listen to the experts, for refusing to lis-
ten to his military advisers. 
Ironically enough, just yesterday, be-
fore this entire Senate had the oppor-
tunity to be briefed by the national se-
curity team, I had a colleague of mine 
from across the aisle say: Everything is 
going to be fine if the President will 
just listen to General Milley and the 
military experts. But he did. Isn’t that, 
ironically, at the crux of a lot of these 
arguments about Ukraine, that all of 
the experts—the career experts, the 
uniformed 
experts—disagreed 
with 
what the President was doing? Yet 
when he listens to what they say, 
somehow it is the act of a reckless 
madman. I think that speaks more to 
the hysteria that has overcome our 
politics and has now reached into the 
realm of national security. 
It is also important to note when 
people say these things, that those who 
walk around talking about intelligence 
sometimes are not consumers of it on a 
regular basis or don’t understand how 
it works. It is never about one piece. It 
is about patterns and trends and known 
capabilities and known intentions and 
about windows of opportunity. That is 
an important point to make. 
As far as consulting with congres-
sional leadership before taking this ac-
tion, that is not how things like this 
develop. Very rarely do you have the 
luxury of time. 
No. 1, I would start out by saying 
that there is no legal requirement. The 
President of the United States has no 
legal requirement, and, in fact, I be-
lieve has an imperative, inherent in the 
Office, to act swiftly and appropriately 
to the threat against the lives of Amer-
icans, especially American troops that 
he or she has sent abroad to defend this 
country’s interests. 
No. 2, it is unrealistic and not pos-
sible. Oftentimes, these windows of op-
portunity do not allow you the luxury 
of reaching some congressional leader 
in the middle of their ski trip or 
Christmas break, and even if you could, 
there is always the risk that the infor-
mation would be disseminated and the 
window would close. So I am not sure if 
what they are asking for is even pos-
sible. 
The other thing that is troubling is, 
if you listen to some of the rhetoric 
out there, you would think that the 
only two options with Iran are a full- 
scale diplomacy and capitulation to 
what they are doing or an all-out war. 
That is absurd, a false choice. It is a 
false choice. 
The President has argued—he said it 
again clearly yesterday—that he is 
ready for serious—serious—and real 
talks toward how Iran becomes a nor-
mal nation and its clerical nation be-
haves in a normal and civilized way. In 
the meantime, he has an obligation— 
this President, a future President, and 
past Presidents—to protect America’s 
interests 
and, 
more 
importantly, 
American lives and to do so through a 
concept of active deterrence. 
What does that mean? Active deter-
rence means that the people who want 
to harm you decide not to because the 
cost of harming you is higher than the 
benefit of harming you. That is an im-
portant point here. The strike on 
Soleimani was not just about pre-
venting an imminent attack. That, in 
and of itself, alone was reason to act, 
but the second thing that was impor-
tant was reestablishing active deter-
rence. 
For whatever reason, the Iranians 
have concluded that they could go fur-
ther than they have ever gone before in 
directly attacking Americans or using 
their proxies to attack Americans. So 
much so that they tried—they failed, 
but 
they 
tried—and 
could 
have 
breached our Embassy compound in 
Baghdad and killed Americans, civil-
ians, and diplomats, and our military 
personnel stationed there. They tried 
to. And they could have and want to 
launch lethal attacks to kill as many 
Americans as they possibly can be-
cause, for whatever reason, they con-
cluded they could get away with it, 
that we would tolerate it. It was crit-
ical to the defense of this country, to 
our national interests, and to the lives 
of our men and women in uniform de-
ployed abroad that we restore active 
deterrence. 
Now, time will tell how much was re-
stored, but, clearly, I believe some of it 
was 
restored. 
Even 
the 
comments 
today 
of 
an 
Iranian 
commander— 
‘‘Well, we shot missiles, but we didn’t 
try to kill anybody’’—are indicative of 
a desire to deescalate, at least for the 
time being. 
The other thing I hear is this: Well, 
the President has no strategy. That is 
the problem. There is no strategy. 
I think you could argue that they 
haven’t done a good-enough job of out-
lining a strategy, but I don’t think it is 
fair to say they have no strategy. 
The strategy begins with a goal. The 
goal is pretty straightforward: a pros-
perous Iran that lives in harmony with 
its neighbors and does not have nuclear 
weapons or continues to support ter-
rorism and terrorist groups. That is the 
goal. 
How do you achieve it? By Iran’s 
abandoning its desire for nuclear weap-
ons and by no longer standing up these 
terrorist groups that, for over a decade 
or longer, have been killing Americans 
and 
trying 
to 
harm 
Americans, 
Israelis, and other allies. 
How else do you achieve it? By im-
posing crushing economic sanctions, 
while leaving open the door for real— 
not fake, not talk for the sake of talk— 
diplomacy, but, at the same time, mak-
ing it abundantly clear that you will 
deter, repel, and act against any effort 
to harm Americans. 
All this talk about military conflict 
and U.S. actions overlooks the funda-
mental fact that what is happening 
here is that Iran has decided to respond 
to economic sanctions with violence. 
Their response to economic sanctions 
has been this: Can we get one of these 
terrorist groups using weapons that we 
give them to kill Americans? Can we 
put limpet mines on merchant ships? 
Can we attack the Saudis? That has 
been their response to economic sanc-
tions: violence. 
Presidents don’t have the luxury of 
bluffing. You can’t go around saying 
‘‘If you kill Americans, there will be 
consequences,’’ and then they try to 
kill Americans—or, in the case of Iran, 
did—and do nothing about it because 
now what you have done is you have in-
vited a committed adversary to do 
more of it—not just to tragically kill 
one brave American contractor but to 
kill dozens or hundreds of Americans in 
various spots throughout the world. 
The last point I want to make is all 
this talk about an authorization for 
use of force. I want to begin by sharing 
my personal view. I believe the War 
Powers Resolution is unconstitutional. 
I think the power of Congress resides in 
the opportunity to declare war and to 
fund it. Every Presidential administra-
tion, Republican and Democrat alike, 
has taken the same position. 
That doesn’t mean we should never 
have an AUMF. I think our actions are 
stronger when it is clear that they 
have strong bipartisan support from 
both Houses of Congress. I also think 
all this talk about AUMFs is com-
pletely and utterly irrelevant to the 
case in point.

Resolution, by the way—the President 
of the United States not only has the 
authority to act in self-defense but an 
obligation to do so. An obligation to do 
so. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, it is especially true in this 
case, where the lives and the troops he 
sought to protect were deployed to Iraq 
on an anti-ISIS, anti-terrorism mission 
approved 
by 
Congress 
through 
an 
AUMF, an AUMF that states very 
clearly that one of the reasons we are 
allowed to use military force, as au-
thorized by Congress, is to defend 
against attacks. 
I don’t believe there is a single Mem-
ber of Congress who has the willingness 
to stand before the American people 
and say: I think, when we deploy troops 
abroad, they should not be allowed to 
defend themselves. 
Not only do you not need an AUMF 
or congressional authority to act in 
self-defense, but the troops who were 
defending themselves here—and the 
troops 
we 
were 
defending 
in 
the 
Soleimani strike and preventing an at-
tack against—are deployed pursuant to 
a congressional authorization. 
Honestly, what I see here, in addition 
to the arguments I have already dis-
cussed about how ridiculous it is to 
portray this as the actions of a reck-
less madman who is escalating things, 
is an argument about when might you 
need an AUMF. Give us some theo-
retical, hypothetical scenario in which 
you 
might 
need 
an 
AUMF. 
The 
hypotheticals they are posturing are 
ones 
that 
this 
administration 
has 
never, never proposed and, frankly, 
haven’t even contemplated. 
No one is talking about an all-out in-
vasion of Iran. If you were telling me 
the President is putting together plans 
to invade Iran, to go in and capture 
territory, to remove the Ayatollah and 
install a new government, I would say: 
All right, that is something that there 
should be a debate about. 
Who is talking about that? I haven’t 
heard 
anybody 
propose 
that. 
Yet, 
somehow, the House today is going to 
spend time on this. People have filed 
bills on this. Look, we can debate any-
thing we want. People can file any bill 
they want. That is a privileged motion. 
It comes to the floor. Great. 
By the way, no one said: Don’t go 
around talking about this; just be 
quiet. 
Perhaps it should have been stated 
more artfully, but the point that was 
being made, which is a valid point, is 
that, when the Iranians analyze re-
sponses to the United States, one of 
the things they look at is this: Do do-
mestic politics and differences of opin-
ion and divisions among American offi-
cials restrain what the President can 
do against us? You may not like it, but 
I want to be frank with you. They be-
lieve that our political differences in 
this country and that our disagree-
ments constrain the President’s ability 
to respond to attacks. They believe it 
limits his ability to deter. Now, hope-
fully the strike on Soleimani may have 
reset that a little bit. That doesn’t 
mean we shouldn’t debate it, and I 
don’t think you should ever tell Con-
gress not to discuss these things. We 
have a right to. Frankly, everybody 
here has been elected by a constitu-
ency, so people can choose to raise 
whichever issue they want. 
I also don’t think it is invalid to 
point out that these internal debates 
we have in this country do have an im-
pact on what our adversaries think 
they can get away with. It doesn’t 
make anyone an appeaser or a traitor, 
but it is a factor I think people should 
recognize. That is all. 
In closing, I would say, look, there 
was a time—I am not one of these peo-
ple who pine for the golden era. It is 
funny. I hear people talking about the 
Clinton impeachment trial. Oftentimes 
people come to me and say: In the good 
old days, back in the nineties, when ev-
erybody got together and Congressmen 
were all friends—and I don’t know 
what it was like then because I wasn’t 
here, but I remind them that, in the 
golden days about which they often 
talk, we were impeaching Bill Clinton 
around here. They didn’t do it on social 
media and Twitter and 24-hour cable 
news at the time, but there has always 
been friction in American politics. 
One thing I can say that is evident is 
that there was a time in American pol-
itics that I hope we can return to, and 
that is a time which, when it came to 
issues of national security, there was 
some level of restraint because we un-
derstood, when it came to that, the 
people who would ultimately pay the 
price for overpoliticizing any issue, for 
reckless talk, and for unnecessary ac-
cusations were not the political fig-
ures. Presidents and Ayatollahs don’t 
die in conflicts like these. Do you know 
who dies? The young men and women 
we send abroad, the innocent civilians 
caught in the middle, and the refugees 
who are forced to leave their homes as 
a result. 
There are real-world, life-and-death 
implications. That is why it has long 
been American tradition that, when it 
comes to issues of foreign policy and 
national security, they were always 
treated just a little bit differently, 
with some deference. Even if you dis-
agreed, you sort of tailored it in a way 
that you thought would not harm those 
interests. 
I think that has been lost, probably, 
on both sides. I still make it a habit 
when I travel abroad not to discuss or 
criticize U.S. leaders at home, but I un-
derstand times have changed. 
I would just say, in this particular 
case, I know that this Nation remains 
conflicted about the conflicts that led 
us into Iran and Afghanistan and that 
keep us in the region to this day. That 
is a valid, valid debate. I just don’t 
think this looks anything like it. This 
is about a strike that every single 
member of the President’s national se-
curity team, including the chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs, believes was nec-
essary in order to prevent a near-term 
attack against Americans that could 
be lethal and catastrophic. 
This is about restoring active deter-
rents, effective deterrents, against fu-
ture strikes, and I hope that we can 
bring that debate back to where it be-
longs so that, on matters of such im-
portance, we can figure out solutions 
and not simple rhetoric. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
RECOGNIZING THE NSA 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
want to extend the thanks of all Mem-
bers of the U.S. Senate and the Amer-
ican people to the men and women who 
are serving our Nation at the National 
Security Agency based at Fort Meade, 
MD, the Defense Special Missile and 
Astronautics Center. It has been in ex-
istence since 1964. It is a 24/7 operation. 
I mention that because it was the work 
done here in the State of Maryland— 
and I am proud to represent that 
State—that gave the early warning in-
formation that allowed us to get infor-
mation to our American forces in Iraq 
and to the Iraqis that, literally, saved 
lives. 
I want to thank them for their dedi-
cated service. We have the best intel-
ligence 
information 
and 
the 
best 
trained people protecting our Nation, 
and I just wanted to pause for one mo-
ment to thank those who are serving at 
the National Security Agency who are 
keeping us safe. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Madam President, shortly we will be 
considering the United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement, the USMCA. It up-
dates and replaces the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. I sup-
port the USMCA and supported it ear-
lier this week, when it passed the Sen-
ate Finance Committee on a strong 25- 
to-3 vote. This strong vote was possible 
because of the hard work of Democrats 
in the House and Senate to make this 
agreement the strongest, fully enforce-
able, pro-environment, pro-labor trade 
agreement the United States has ever 
entered into. 
First let me talk about why I think 
trade is important. I would point out 
to my colleagues that the maiden 
speech I gave in the House of Rep-
resentatives when I was first elected 
was on trade and the importance of 
trade agreements. I recognized how im-
portant the Port of Baltimore was to 
our economy and how important free 
trade and trade was to the Port of Bal-
timore. So, clearly, trade agreements 
are critically important to the people 
of Maryland, and they are important to 
this country. 
First, international trade can lead to 
better economic outcomes. From lev-
eling the playing field for American 
businesses to ensuring our trading 
partners have adequate labor standards 
to make competition fair, trade can be 
the catalyst for these outcomes. Sec-
ond, trade can raise the standard of liv-
ing for citizens in this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S109 
January 9, 2020 
Tariffs can disproportionally harm 
lower income Americans. If the cost of 
things like milk, soap, or school sup-
plies goes up because of higher tariffs, 
it doesn’t mean these families will stop 
buying these essentials. It means they 
will have less to spend on other essen-
tials they depend on to keep their fam-
ilies safe and healthy, like clothes and 
medicine. 
Trade agreements allow us to ensure 
a zero or low tariff price for these 
items on which Americans depend, 
which raises the standard of living for 
all of us. 
Third, trade is important to U.S. for-
eign policy. The world can be better, 
safer, and a fairer place when we are 
working with our allies. Trade agree-
ments ensure the rest of the world 
starts to act a little bit more as we do, 
with our values. 
This administration’s harmful and 
nonstrategic trade policy has strained 
our relationship with our allies, includ-
ing Canada and Mexico. I think it has 
been misguided and damaging to the 
future of our country, but this agree-
ment has the potential to begin a heal-
ing process with our North American 
neighbors: Canada and Mexico. 
As we move forward with trade 
agreements, it is important that our 
values are represented in those agree-
ments, that we strengthen American 
values. I support good governance and 
protecting workers and our environ-
ment, and I am pleased that they are 
included in such agreements. 
For more than 25 years since the en-
actment of NAFTA, our economy has 
changed dramatically, from the pro-
liferation of the Internet, which has 
changed how businesses can easily be 
connected to the rest of the world, to 
how consumers shop, compare prices, 
and buy goods and services from all 
around the world, and it is clear that 
NAFTA is a trade agreement that 
didn’t foresee these changes with our 
two largest trading partners. In addi-
tion, over time, we identified weak-
nesses in NAFTA and other free trade 
agreements that needed to be ad-
dressed. 
All that is to say that NAFTA is 
overdue for an update. For the past 21⁄2 
years, the administration, congres-
sional leaders, and our trading partners 
have been engaged in the process to up-
date NAFTA to be a trade agreement 
for the 21st century. In late 2018, an 
agreement was reached between the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico. Im-
portantly, reaching this agreement al-
leviated the threat of this administra-
tion to unilaterally withdraw from 
NAFTA. 
The agreement reached in 2018 was, 
in my view, incomplete and largely 
just continued the existing NAFTA, 
but it did have some provisions impor-
tant to me and my constituents in the 
State of Maryland. 
Maryland is home to a thriving poul-
try industry. The agreement includes 
new market access to Canada for U.S. 
poultry. Maryland farms produced $1 
billion worth of chickens in 2017, sur-
passing that milestone for the first 
time. Our poultry industry production 
grew 12 percent from 2016 to 2017. 
The growth in value came even as the 
amount of chickens produced on the 
Eastern Shore declined by about 10,000 
pounds to about 1.84 million pounds. 
Maryland is the Nation’s ninth largest 
producer of broiler chickens. 
This additional market access is good 
for Maryland’s poultry industry be-
cause it means more poultry produced 
in Maryland will make its way to Can-
ada and Mexico, creating jobs and sup-
porting the economy here locally. 
The agreement also included a few 
provisions that are very important for 
small businesses. Most important to 
many small businesses is a provision 
that raises the level of the so-called de 
minimis customs and tariff treatment 
of goods. The de minimis system is im-
portant to small businesses. For exam-
ple, small sellers who list their goods 
on eBay or Amazon frequently ship to 
consumers not in the United States. 
Under the de minimis system, if a ship-
ment under the de minimis level 
crosses the border, it enjoys expedited 
customs and lower tariff treatment 
than larger shipments would. 
Under this agreement, the United 
States agreed to increase its customs 
de minimis levels to $800 for exports to 
Mexico and Canada, and Mexico and 
Canada have made favorable changes 
to their systems. As ranking member 
of the Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship Committee, this was a wel-
come change to ensure small busi-
nesses aren’t bogged down by unneces-
sary redtape. 
The agreement’s small business chap-
ter also includes support for small 
businesses to promote cross-border co-
operation, tools for small businesses to 
identify potential opportunities and in-
crease competitiveness, and public- 
sharing tools to promote access to cap-
ital. These are important issues to 
highlight for small businesses. 
Finally, the initial agreement in-
cluded a landmark achievement for the 
first time in U.S. trade history: It in-
cluded a full chapter on anti-corrup-
tion. 
During 2015, when the Senate was 
considering so-called fast-track trade 
promotion authority, under which the 
USMCA is now being considered, I au-
thored a principal negotiating objec-
tive in the trade promotion authority 
legislation that requires any trade 
agreement the USTR negotiates to em-
phasize 
good 
governance, 
human 
rights, and the rule of law. These are 
our values. These values need to be re-
flected in our trade agreement. It is an 
important step toward a level playing 
field for trade with the United States 
for our farmers, our producers, and our 
manufacturers. We know our system is 
a fair system, but in so many other 
countries we deal with, that is not the 
case. 
This principal negotiating objective 
really represents an enduring theme in 
the way I approach trade. I believe we 
should use the economic power of the 
United States to advance human rights 
and good governance in other countries 
that may comparatively struggle on 
that front. I also believe we should not 
have favorable free-trade agreements 
with countries that do not believe 
human rights and good governance are 
important to uphold. 
Because of my focus on this require-
ment in 2015 and thanks to USTR Am-
bassador 
Robert 
Lighthizer, 
the 
USMCA is a trade agreement that for 
the first time includes a chapter on 
anti-corruption and good governance. 
This is our first agreement that in-
cludes such a chapter, and I anticipate 
this will be the template for any future 
trade agreement involving the United 
States. 
The USMCA’s anti-corruption chap-
ter includes a number of commitments 
on transparency, integrity, and ac-
countability of public institutions and 
officials. 
First, on anti-corruption laws, under 
the USMCA, countries are required to 
outlaw embezzlement and solicitation 
of bribes by public officials and must 
make it a criminal offense for anyone 
to offer bribes to public officials to in-
fluence their official duties or to offi-
cials of foreign governments or inter-
national organizations to gain a busi-
ness advantage. 
I know that sounds like a no-brainer. 
Why wouldn’t all countries already 
have those types of laws? But the re-
ality is that they don’t. The reality is 
that many of our trading partners have 
corrupt systems, and that puts Amer-
ican companies at a disadvantage. But 
also, we should be using our economic 
power to advance our values. This 
chapter carries that out. 
Second, on transparency and ac-
countability, under the USMCA, coun-
tries must take proactive steps against 
corruption by implementing and main-
taining accounting and auditing stand-
ards and measures that prohibit the 
creation of false transaction records 
and off-the-book accounts. 
Third, the USMCA requires parties to 
create codes of conduct and procedures 
for removal of corrupt officials, as well 
as adopt measures requiring officials to 
disclose 
outside 
activities, 
invest-
ments, and gifts that could create con-
flicts of interest. 
Fourth, on public engagement, under 
USMCA, countries must agree to pro-
mote the engagement of the business 
community, NGOs, and civil societies 
in anti-corruption efforts through in-
formation campaigns, developing eth-
ics programs, and protecting the free-
dom to publish information about cor-
ruption. 
Finally, on good regulatory prac-
tices, under the USMCA, countries 
must follow a transparent regulatory 
rulemaking process, which the agree-
ment clarifies includes publishing the 
proposed regulation with its regulatory 
impact assessment, an explanation of 
the proposed regulation, a description

of the underlining data and other infor-
mation, and the contact information of 
responsible officials. 
USMCA further requires parties to 
follow the U.S.-like system of notice 
and comment periods for proposed reg-
ulatory rulemaking in which the regu-
lators are required to consider com-
ments of any interested party, regard-
less of nationality, which means Amer-
icans will have input in the regulatory 
process in Canada and Mexico, which 
has direct effect on our access to their 
markets. 
The countries also agreed to publish 
an early planning document of regula-
tions the country intends to revise in 
the next 12 months and to ensure that 
regulations are written in a clear, con-
cise, and understandable manner. 
The USMCA encourages authorities 
to consider the impact of new regula-
tions when they are being developed, 
with particular attention to the bene-
fits and costs of regulations and the 
feasibility of other approaches. 
This 
is 
an 
incredibly 
important 
achievement, and it is important as a 
model for U.S. agreements going for-
ward. 
By including the good governance 
and anti-corruption provisions in the 
USMCA, we are signaling to our trad-
ing partners and the rest of the world 
what our values are—yes, economic 
values, but also the principles we ad-
vance. 
However, with these good achieve-
ments in the original USMCA, the 
agreement did not go far enough. There 
was no deadline to getting it done 
quickly, so we chose to get it done 
right. 
I wanted to see strict, high standards 
in the USMCA on labor, environment, 
and more. Democrats were united in 
this message. Democrats worked be-
hind the scenes with labor and environ-
mental stakeholders to identify issues 
and create solutions that could make 
this agreement one we could support. 
Do I think the USMCA lives up to 
these standards? Yes, I do. The updated 
USMCA includes important provisions 
regarding labor standards, which have 
the potential to improve working con-
ditions and create a more level playing 
field for U.S. workers. 
These changes include the Brown- 
Wyden 
rapid-response 
mechanism, 
which enables the United States to 
take swift enforcement action against 
imports from individual facilities, and 
stronger labor obligations in the agree-
ment. The changes include a number of 
other important labor issues, including 
strengthened labor obligations, new 
labor-monitoring 
mechanisms, 
and 
extra funding for labor efforts. The im-
plementing bill includes new mecha-
nisms and resources to ensure that the 
U.S. Government effectively monitors 
Mexico’s compliance with the labor ob-
ligations. 
The result of these labor additions 
earned support for the USMCA by the 
AFL–CIO, United Steelworkers, and 
the 
International 
Brotherhood 
of 
Teamsters. Truly, this is an agreement 
that is good for labor. 
Another 
critical 
aspect 
of 
the 
USMCA is that it ensures that our 
trading partners meet the environ-
mental standards of this country. We 
want a level playing field. We also 
want to help our environment. 
With respect to the environment, the 
updated USMCA is a significant im-
provement over the original NAFTA. 
The 
USMCA 
incorporates 
environ-
mental obligations into the agreement 
itself, which are subject to dispute set-
tlement, unlike the original NAFTA, 
which only included an unenforceable 
side-agreement. 
The USMCA includes upgraded com-
mitments on topics including fisheries 
subsidies, marine litter, and conserva-
tion of marine species. 
Democrats secured amendments to 
the agreement, as well as provisions in 
the implementing bill, to strengthen 
the ability of the United States to 
monitor and enforce the obligations 
and ensure that the parties are bound 
to their environmental obligations. 
I want to acknowledge my colleague 
Senator CARPER, the ranking member 
of the Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee, which I also sit on. 
Together, we pushed to improve this 
agreement with respect to the enforce-
ability of the environmental provi-
sions. We were happy to see this agree-
ment include many of the things Sen-
ator CARPER and I worked and pushed 
to have done. 
Included in the new USMCA is a new 
trigger mechanism to give environ-
mental stakeholders an expanded role 
in environmental enforcement matters 
and create accountability for the ad-
ministration with regard to seeking en-
vironmental 
enforcement 
actions 
under USMCA. 
Under the existing NAFTA, any per-
son in a NAFTA country can make a 
submission to an intergovernmental 
organization established by NAFTA to 
address environmental issues, alleging 
that a NAFTA partner is not living up 
to its environmental obligations. You 
can do that. Submissions undergo a 
public factfinding process by the head 
of that body, which produces a factual 
record if the allegation is found to have 
merit. 
Here is where the problem comes in: 
Once the production of that factual 
record is done, there is no enforcement 
mechanism. We have corrected that. 
Through this new trigger mechanism 
in the USMCA that was developed, if a 
factual record is produced, the new 
Interagency Environment Committee, 
headed by the USTR, will have 30 days 
to review the record and make a deter-
mination as to whether to pursue en-
forcement 
actions 
under 
USMCA 
against the violating country. If the 
committee, headed by the USTR, de-
cides not to pursue enforcement ac-
tions under USMCA, within 30 days 
after its determination, the committee 
must provide Congress with a written 
explanation and justification of its de-
cision. This is a huge step forward in 
quickly identifying and addressing any 
environmental action that needs to be 
taken under this agreement. 
In addition, the agreement includes 
an additional $88 million of funding ap-
propriated over the next 4 years for en-
vironmental monitoring and enforce-
ment to ensure that the goals of the 
USMCA’s environment chapter can be 
realized. This includes $40 million ap-
propriated over the next 4 years for the 
new 
environment 
sub-fund 
Senator 
CARPER and I pushed to create under 
the USTR’s existing Trade Enforce-
ment Trust Fund, which will be dedi-
cated to enforcement of the USMCA’s 
environmental obligations. 
As I mentioned, the United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement establishes 
an 
Interagency 
Environment 
Com-
mittee, led by the USTR, which will co-
ordinate U.S. Government efforts to 
monitor implementation of its environ-
mental goals. It also establishes up to 
three 
new 
environment-focused 
attache´s in Mexico City to help ensure 
Mexico is living up to its environ-
mental obligations. It includes new re-
porting requirements to regularly as-
sess the status of Mexico’s laws and 
regulations that are intended to imple-
ment its environmental obligations to 
help ensure Mexico is living up to its 
commitments. 
We believe the USMCA is a strong, 
enforceable 
agreement 
that 
makes 
positive strides in protecting the envi-
ronment. As this agreement is imple-
mented, I will be watching to ensure 
that the other parties to this agree-
ment live up to the promises they are 
making in this bill. 
In closing, I support the USMCA be-
cause it will help raise the living 
standards for Marylanders, cuts red-
tape for small businesses, and unites us 
with our allies. The provisions of the 
USMCA protect the environment, help 
labor organizing efforts, fights for good 
governance and against corruption, and 
is enforceable. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation when it comes to the floor. 
I yield the floor.

IRAN 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to speak about the 
policy of the United States toward the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. I commend 
the administration for taking decisive 
action last week in Baghdad against 
Tehran-backed terrorists planning an 
imminent attack on American targets. 
The 
administration’s 
action 
with 
Qasem Soleimani was not only decisive 
but necessary and legal under long-
standing Presidential authority to pro-
tect American lives from imminent at-
tack. It is our obligation, it is our duty 
to protect American lives, especially 
when our national security agencies 
and personnel know the imminent dan-
ger of attack. 
The President made the right call at 
the right time to neutralize the threat

and to save American lives. Imagine 
having 
done 
nothing—having 
done 
nothing—and allowing the attacks to 
proceed. That is exactly what hap-
pened. At yesterday’s classified brief-
ing, General Milley and our national 
security personnel made it clear: The 
death of General Soleimani saved lives. 
Our duty in Congress is to protect 
the United States, its people and inter-
ests, diplomats, and our men and 
women in uniform around the globe. 
The actions taken by our military in 
Iraq undoubtedly saved American lives 
and addressed a clear, compelling, and 
unambiguous threat. 
The world should not mourn Qasem 
Soleimani—a man whose name is syn-
onymous with murder in the Middle 
East as the head of the Islamic Revolu-
tionary 
Guard 
Corps’ 
Quds 
Force, 
which is designated as a terrorist orga-
nization under U.S. law; a man who 
was personally designated as a ter-
rorist battlefield commander by Presi-
dent Obama. The Quds Force was the 
tip of the spear for the regime in its 
terrorist activities abroad and is re-
sponsible 
for 
thousands 
of 
deaths 
across the region. 
Most importantly, according to the 
Pentagon, Soleimani was responsible 
for the deaths of over 600 American 
servicemembers in Iraq. GEN David 
Petraeus, who commanded our forces 
in Iraq, stated last week that in his 
opinion, taking out Soleimani was big-
ger 
than 
bin 
Laden, 
bigger 
than 
Baghdadi. 
In other words, President Trump rid 
the world of an extreme and lethal 
enemy of the American people—some-
one who was actively pursuing and had 
killed and taken American lives. I fail 
to understand how anyone can question 
this decision or its rationale. I know 
they certainly did not—and rightfully 
so—when President Obama took out 
bin Laden. 
We expected an Iranian response, and 
on Tuesday, Iran launched a ballistic 
missile attack against bases in Iraq 
hosting U.S. troops. I condemn these 
attacks in the strongest terms, and we 
are fortunate that they did not result 
in any casualties. 
I do not want war with Iran, but the 
President did not take this action in a 
vacuum. Contrary to claims by some of 
my colleagues in this very Chamber, it 
is Iran that has escalated tensions, not 
the United States. Over the last several 
months and years, Iran has sharply es-
calated its malign behavior against the 
United States and our allies. 
On June 13, the IRGC attacked two 
oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, a 
critical global shipping lane. On June 
20, the IRGC shot down a U.S. un-
manned aerial vehicle in international 
space. September 14, Iran sponsored an 
attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, 
temporarily cutting off half of the oil 
supply of the world’s largest producer. 
December 
27, 
Iranian proxy group 
Kataib Hezbollah carried out a deadly 
attack against a base in northern Iraq, 
killing an American civilian—killing 
an American. The administration ap-
propriately 
retaliated 
against 
this 
group on December 29. Then, on New 
Year’s Eve, Iran-backed militias be-
sieged and damaged the U.S. Embassy 
in Baghdad for 2 days, forcing the ad-
ministration to take prudent measures 
to prevent further violence. 
When Soleimani was caught plotting 
additional attacks against American 
targets, the administration took lawful 
and appropriate action. I now urge 
Tehran to take the opportunity to de-
escalate tensions immediately. The ad-
ministration must also continue tak-
ing all necessary steps to keep our 
troops, diplomats, and countries safe, 
and to regularly consult with Congress 
on next steps. 
It is my hope that diplomacy ulti-
mately prevails, but we must not re-
peat the mistakes of the past. Iran’s 
enmity 
toward 
the 
United 
States 
stretches over decades, not just months 
or weeks. Following the Islamic Revo-
lution in Iran in 1979, the ruling 
mullahs held 52 American diplomats 
hostage for 444 days, releasing them 
only on January 20, 1981, the day Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan was sworn into of-
fice. Two years later, on April 18, 1983, 
a truck laden with explosives rammed 
into the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Leb-
anon, killing 17 Americans. On October 
23, 1983, a similar attack on the U.S. 
Marine barracks in Beirut killed 241 
American 
servicemen. 
Overwhelm-
ingly, the evidence led to Iran and its 
wholly owned subsidiary, Hezbollah, as 
the perpetrator of these attacks. 
The Iranian regime has not changed 
in 40 years. It targeted and killed 
Americans during the Iraq war, sup-
ported Shiite militias, and supplied 
deadly explosives used to target our 
troops. Iran continues to prop up the 
regime of the murderous Bashar al- 
Assad in Syria. The Iranian regime reg-
ularly refers to the United States as 
the Great Satan and threatens our ally, 
Israel, which they call Little Satan— 
threatens to wipe them off the face of 
the Earth. The mullahs continue to 
grossly abuse the human rights of their 
own people, as demonstrated by recent 
bloody crackdowns on protesters in 
Iran that have claimed hundreds and 
hundreds of innocent lives. 
Despite all of this, in 2015, the Obama 
administration rewarded Tehran with a 
sweetheart deal known as the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action, or 
JCPOA, which paved a patient pathway 
to a nuclear weapon for Iran, lifted all 
meaningful sanctions against the re-
gime, and did nothing to constrain 
Iran’s malign behavior in the region. 
Iran used the billions of dollars that 
were provided in the JCPOA to dra-
matically increase its terror funding 
and its military funding. 
The Trump administration rightly 
exited the JCPOA in May 2018 and re-
imposed crippling economic sanctions 
against the regime. They have been 
clear with Iran that the door to diplo-
macy remains open if Iran changes its 
behavior and complies with inter-
national norms. 
On May 21, 2018, Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo delivered a speech at the 
Heritage Foundation, which clearly 
stated the administration’s objectives: 
Iran must forgo its nuclear aspirations, 
cease its support for terrorism, and re-
spect the human rights of its people. 
Secretary Pompeo said: 
Any new agreement will make sure Iran 
never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will 
deter the regime’s malign behavior in a way 
the JCPOA never could. 
We will not repeat the mistakes of past ad-
ministrations, and we will not renegotiate 
the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of de-
struction in the region in just the last few 
years is proof that Iran’s nuclear aspirations 
cannot be separated from the overall secu-
rity picture. 
Secretary Pompeo was clear that 
once Iran changes its behavior, it will 
reap the benefits, stating: 
[The United States is] prepared to end the 
principal components of every one of our 
sanctions against the regime. We’re happy at 
that point to re-establish full diplomatic and 
commercial relationships with Iran. 
And we’re prepared to admit Iran to have 
advanced technology. If Iran makes this fun-
damental strategic shift, we, too, are pre-
pared to support the modernization and re-
integration of the Iranian economy into the 
international economic system. 
I hope the latest events have made it 
clear to Tehran that the United States 
will never back down from protecting 
our people, our interests, and our al-
lies. Now the ball is in Tehran’s court 
to choose the path of peace or the path 
of confrontation. It is my sincere hope 
that they choose the path of peace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
have come to the floor today to talk 
for a while about the nomination of 
Paul Ray to serve as Administrator of 
the Office of Information and Regu-
latory Affairs. I will do that, but first 
I want to take a few minutes to set the 
record straight on what we just heard. 
Tom Friedman, who writes for the 
New York Times, is a famous author, 
lecturer, and a brilliant guy. Among 
the things he has mentioned in his 
writings over the last 3 years is some-
thing called the Trump doctrine. The 
Trump doctrine goes something like 
this: Barack built it. I, Trump, broke 
it. You fix it. 
There are any number of examples 
where that has happened: Paris accords 
on reducing emissions of carbon diox-
ide on our planet and the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, where the United States 
would lead 11 other nations in a trade 
agreement around the world. Those 12 
nations would be responsible for 40 per-
cent of the world’s trade. Under that 
agreement negotiated in the last ad-
ministration, the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership, we would lead that 12-nation 
group in 40 percent of the world’s 
trade. China was on the outside look-
ing in. This administration walked 
away from that. 
The greatest source of carbon emis-
sions in our planet and the greatest 
threat to the future of the planet for

S112 
January 9, 2020 
these young pages—whom I am looking 
at now—is way, way too much carbon 
dioxide in our atmosphere. It is getting 
worse, not getting better. The greatest 
source of carbon emissions on our plan-
et are emissions from our cars, trucks, 
and vans. 
The last administration negotiated a 
50-State deal, which would have re-
duced emissions from mobile sources 
dramatically in the years to come. 
This administration broke away from 
it. They walked away from it. The last 
administration negotiated a rule regu-
lation to dramatically reduce emis-
sions from the second greatest source 
of carbon emissions in this country and 
from our utilities: coal-fired utilities, 
primarily. If you add together the re-
duction in carbon dioxide emissions 
going forward from our mobile sources 
negotiated by the last administration 
and negotiated in a regulation called 
the Clean Power Plan, they would pro-
vide almost half of the emission reduc-
tions by 2050 that we need—almost 
half. This administration walked away 
from both. 
The last administration argued that 
rather than always be threatening war 
with Iran and doing these proxy wars 
with Iran, maybe what we should focus 
on is the main thing. A friend used to 
advise me. He said: TOM, the main 
thing is keep the main thing the main 
thing. The reason why we negotiated 
the JCPOA deal with Iran was to deter 
Iran from developing and having nu-
clear weapons that could create a nu-
clear arms race in the Middle East and 
put them and, I think, the rest of our 
planet, literally, at risk. Under the 
agreement negotiated with Iran and six 
other nations—including the United 
States, the Brits, the French, the Ger-
mans, the Russians, the Chinese— 
under the agreement, the Iranians had 
to agree to stand down, to slow down 
much of their nuclear enrichment that 
could actually lead to nuclear weapons. 
They had to agree to intrusive inspec-
tions by the IAEA, the international 
watchdog for atomic energy. In return 
for their willingness to do those things, 
we would reduce the very harsh sanc-
tions that had been put in place by the 
last administration—very harsh eco-
nomic sanctions. 
The Iranians did what they agreed to 
do. They stood down their develop-
ment. They opened up their facilities 
to intrusive inspections by the IAEA 
for the last 4 years. There were almost 
20 different rounds of inspections, each 
of which came to the same conclusion: 
Iran, whether we like it or not, wheth-
er we like their leaders or not, kept 
their word. Some of us remember what 
Ronald Reagan used to talk about. He 
used to say that in terms of doing nu-
clear deals with the Russians—the So-
viets—he used to say: ‘‘Trust but 
verify.’’ 
Well, what we did with the Iran deal 
was mistrust or distrust. We didn’t 
trust them, but we would verify that 
they were keeping their word. Whether 
we like it or not, surprisingly, they 
did, until this administration came 
along and walked away from that 
agreement, which was working. It im-
posed even harsher sanctions on Iran 
and led us to, really, where we are 
today. 
Again, Tom Friedman, who gave us 
the Trump doctrine: Barack built it. I, 
Trump broke it. You fix it. This is just 
another example of that happening. We 
shouldn’t be surprised by the events of 
the past week. It didn’t have to be that 
way. It didn’t have to be that way. 
I think in the country of Iran, half of 
the people are under the age of 25. They 
were never born when the original Aya-
tollah was in charge, and they had the 
Iranian revolution. The younger people 
there would like a better relationship 
with us. They have elections there, too, 
where people can actually show up and 
vote—men and women—vote for munic-
ipal elections, for mayors, city coun-
cils, and so forth, for Parliament— 
their Congress is called the Par-
liament—for their President. I think 
the last time they voted was 3 years 
ago. You know which forces gained 
votes? They don’t have Democrats or 
Republicans over there. They have 
hard-liners, and they have moderates. 
The moderates gained election vic-
tories in mayoral elections across the 
country and city council elections 
across the country. The moderates 
picked up a lot of votes in the Par-
liament. The hard-liners lost votes. 
The actions of this administration 
over the last 3 years have pushed Ira-
nian voters, including a lot of young 
people, away from supporting the mod-
erates in their Nation and pushed them 
into the arms of the radical extremists, 
the hard-liners. It didn’t have to be 
that way. It didn’t have to be that way. 
I don’t know how we put this mess 
back together again, but we need to. I 
am not sure. I don’t have a lot of con-
fidence that this administration is 
going to be able to do that, given their 
track record over the last 3 years—at 
least on this issue. 
NOMINATION OF PAUL J. RAY 
Madam President, let me talk about 
Paul Ray. Paul Ray is a bright young 
man. He is the kind of person I think 
most of us would say: He ought to be in 
an administration. I don’t care if it is 
a Democratic administration or a Re-
publican administration. He is smart, 
well educated, and has good experience. 
He has been the nominee to head some-
thing called OIRA, the Office of Infor-
mation and Regulatory Affairs, an en-
tity that exists within OMB. 
I have met him. He has come to my 
office to talk with me. He is a very po-
lite young man. He has been before our 
committee. I voted today against his 
confirmation. I will tell you why. The 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs used to be the 
Committee on Governmental Affairs. I 
served on it for 19 years. One of the 
things I love about that committee is 
that we have oversight over the whole 
Federal Government. Every committee 
we serve on, including committees the 
Presiding Officer serves on, all have an 
oversight role. A lot of that oversight 
deals with the administration as part 
of our checks and balances. We can 
only do that job so well if the adminis-
tration allows us to do our job. 
During the confirmation process—as 
the Presiding Officer knows—witnesses 
and nominees come before us from the 
administration. They have been vetted 
by the administration. They have gone 
through staff interviews. Then they 
come to a committee hearing. We also 
ask questions of the nominees that are 
relevant to the jobs they are going to 
do. 
Every now and then, you have a 
nominee for a particular position who 
is not forthcoming in his or her re-
sponses, so we do something called 
QFRs, which are questions for the 
record. They are designed to give the 
nominee another bite at the apple in 
responding to the questions that Demo-
crats and Republicans have. A lot of 
times, the nominees are forthcoming, 
and that is good. The nominations then 
move forward, and they get confirmed. 
I have learned, if nominees are not 
forthcoming and are not responsive to 
the oversight questions we ask before 
they get confirmed, good luck after 
they get confirmed, for it doesn’t get 
any better. I don’t care whether you 
happen to be a Democrat or a Repub-
lican; you have to be concerned about 
the reluctance and the unwillingness of 
nominees to respond to reasonable 
questions regardless of who is in the 
White House and regardless of who is in 
the majority of this body. 
Let me say a word or two about 
OIRA. OIRA plays a central role in es-
tablishing regulatory and information 
collection policies across our entire 
Federal Government. OIRA oversees 
the rulemaking process from start to 
finish—from the reviewing of drafts of 
proposed and final rules, to managing 
the interagency review process, to en-
suring agencies make rulemaking deci-
sions based on sound cost-benefit anal-
yses. 
The Administrator of OIRA is a criti-
cally important position because, at 
the end of the day, he or she is respon-
sible for ensuring that rules promul-
gated by agencies benefit our society, 
protect our quality of life, protect our 
health, protect our safety, and protect 
our environment. 
Earlier today, I joined a number of 
my colleagues on the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works in a 
letter to Mr. Ray. We asked him to re-
view concerns that have been raised re-
cently by the EPA’s Science Advisory 
Board about four specific rulemakings 
that are currently under review. 
The EPA’s Science Advisory Board 
found serious concerns with the Trump 
administration’s clean car standards 
rule, with the administration’s pro-
posed mercury and air toxics rule, with 
the administration’s clean water rule 
rollbacks, as well as with a proposed 
EPA secret science rule, which will 
have the effect of limiting the science

the 
EPA 
can 
actually 
use 
in 
rulemakings. The Science Advisory 
Board found serious shortcomings with 
how 
the 
EPA 
conducted 
these 
rulemakings. Either the cost-benefit 
analysis was deficient or insufficient, 
the Agency did not use the best avail-
able science, or the legal rationale that 
underpinned the rule was faulty. 
In case you are wondering who se-
lects the members of this EPA Science 
Advisory Board, as it turns out, it is 
the President. In this case, all 44 mem-
bers of the EPA Science Advisory 
Board were nominated or were renomi-
nated under this administration, by 
this President. They said that there 
are serious problems with the four 
rulemakings that I just mentioned. 
They are not Obama’s people. They 
were nominated by this President. 
Mr. Ray has served in top leadership 
positions at OIRA since June of 2018. 
First, he was an Associate Adminis-
trator. Then, in March of last year, he 
was promoted to Acting Administrator. 
Mr. Ray has presided over or has been 
involved with dozens of controversial 
rulemaking decisions in the last year 
and a half at OIRA, including the 
rulemakings outlined in the letter that 
I mentioned we are sending him today. 
That is why, during the vetting proc-
ess of his nomination, I, along with my 
colleagues on the Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee, 
asked for information about Mr. Ray’s 
background and his work in the last 
year and a half at OIRA, which is with-
in the OMB. Specifically, we asked him 
about his involvement in many con-
troversial regulatory rulemaking deci-
sions that have been put forward by the 
current 
administration. 
Unfortu-
nately—sadly, really—Mr. Ray and the 
Office of Management and Budget have 
refused to provide the Senate with the 
information needed to vet Mr. Ray’s 
nomination. As best as I can tell, they 
didn’t even try. 
Unfortunately, throughout the vet-
ting process, Mr. Ray apparently re-
fused to answer the Senators’ questions 
by asserting privilege or deferring to 
the OMB’s General Counsel more fre-
quently than any past OIRA nominee 
who has ever appeared before our com-
mittee. Something is wrong with that. 
I don’t care if you are a Democrat or a 
Republican in this body or if the nomi-
nee comes from a Democratic Presi-
dent or a Republican President; some-
thing is wrong with that. 
In fact, Mr. Ray asserted privilege or 
deferred to counsel 19 times in his pre-
hearing questionnaire responses alone. 
Is that a lot? That may well be more 
times than any other nominee in the 
history of this agency. Think about 
that. While it might be appropriate to 
withhold or redact particular content 
in some narrow circumstances, Mr. 
Ray and the OMB’s Office of General 
Counsel have misapplied overly broad 
privileges to avoid providing Congress 
with critical information and docu-
ments related to his work at OIRA. 
Have you ever heard of checks and 
balances? There is a reason we have 
oversight. There is a reason we don’t 
have Kings or Monarchs here who can 
do anything they want without a check 
or a balance. Sadly, this nomination 
process, at least for this nominee—and 
I think he is well qualified and bright— 
takes a thumb and sticks it in the eye 
of checks and balances. 
Unfortunately, should this body vote 
to confirm Mr. Ray, his general ap-
proach of nonresponsiveness to the 
committee’s vetting process sets a con-
cerning precedent, not just for him and 
not just for nominees of this agency, 
but for future nominees and subsequent 
oversight efforts to hold the executive 
branch accountable. 
It has been my privilege to serve on 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs for 19 years 
now. We are an oversight committee 
that conducts oversight not just over 
the whole Federal Government but on 
matters that are important to our Na-
tion outside of the government. One of 
our core duties is to ensure that nomi-
nees are forthcoming and provide the 
Senate with the information we need 
to do our jobs. 
Eventually, we are going to have an 
election. Who knows who is going to 
win the next time and who will be in 
the majority here in this body? Yet, 
under any administration, we should 
expect the nominees who appear before 
the Senate to be forthcoming and to 
provide us with the relevant informa-
tion we need to adequately vet their 
nominations. 
For these reasons, I must reluctantly 
note my opposition to Mr. Ray’s nomi-
nation for now and urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield? 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield to the 
Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
IRAN 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before 
Senator BLACKBURN
arrived on the 
floor, I talked about Iran, as many of 
us have. I mentioned the opposition 
that some folks in Iran had—that the 
Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force 
had—to actually entering into negotia-
tions with the United States and five 
other nations to get the Iran deal, the 
JCPOA. As far as I can tell, nobody was 
a stronger opponent to Iran’s negoti-
ating with us and five other nations— 
nobody, as best I can tell, was a strong-
er opponent for Iran’s doing that, for 
sitting down and trying to work things 
out—than Soleimani. 
We are not going to miss that guy, 
but he was one of the strongest oppo-
nents who had actually taken what, I 
think, was a reasonable course. Sadly, 
this administration walked away from 
it. 
I thank my colleague for yielding. 
NOMINATION OF PAUL J. RAY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, let 
me begin by saying that Paul Ray is a 
Tennesseean and that we are delighted 
he is being confirmed to the OIRA. He 
is qualified and will serve our Nation 
well in the future just as he has in the 
past. 
IRAN 
Mr. President, I also want to say a 
few things about the situation in Iran 
and about some of the comments that 
we have heard here on the floor today. 
First of all, I think it is important to 
set the record straight when it comes 
to the Iran deal. We hear people say: 
Well, we never should have walked 
away from it. Let me tell you some-
thing. We should never have been in it 
in the first place. We should never have 
been in this. How in heaven’s name 
could anybody have thought it was a 
good idea to put $1.7 billion of cash on 
a pallet, stick it on a plane, and fly it 
to Iran? Whoever would have thought 
that? 
The Iran nuclear deal was not some-
thing that helped to stabilize an issue; 
it incentivized Iran to do bad things. 
See, the Iran deal included a lifting of 
sanctions on Qasem Soleimani. Where 
was the first place he went? Where was 
the first place he went to get somebody 
to help to fund the Quds Force—to help 
fund all of this terrorism? He went to 
Russia—to his friends. This is why the 
Iran deal was not a good thing. 
Now, you can say they had to open 
their nuclear facilities to the IAEA, 
but there was a little caveat in there 
that doesn’t get talked about a lot. 
They opened it with notification. Well, 
if you are going to get prior notifica-
tion that somebody is going to look at 
your company, to look at your oper-
ation, to look at your house, to look at 
your country, what are you going to 
do? You are going to clean it up, and 
you are going to hide things. That is 
the Iran deal. They didn’t stop enrich-
ing uranium. What they did was enrich 
it right up to the point at which it was 
just under the mark. Did they give it 
up? No, they didn’t give it up. 
My colleague had mentioned the 
Reagan term of ‘‘trust but verify.’’ 
Thank goodness we have a President 
who decided he would verify, and thank 
goodness we have an intel community 
and a U.S. military that did the heavy 
lifting of figuring out what needed to 
be done. 
When you hear one of my colleagues 
ask, ‘‘How do we put this back together 
or can we ever put it back together?’’ 
we have started putting it back to-
gether. We have done it by saying: All 
right, folks, here is our redline. Guess 
what. This redline means something. 
This redline is drawn with the blood of 
hundreds of Americans who have been 
killed by this murderous villain. It is a 
redline of justice. 
So let’s not have happy talk when it 
comes to this situation with Iran. Let’s 
make certain we understand what has 
transpired. We know that our military 
and our intel communities watched for 
8 months as there was escalating vio-
lence. We know that violence was or-
chestrated 
by 
none 
other 
than

Soleimani himself. Intelligence pro-
vided to senior administration officials 
prior to the strike confirmed that 
Soleimani had posed a defined threat 
to the United States. 
When we speak about Iran in the con-
text of conflict versus deterrence, we 
are not referring to a government or a 
military organization. It is important 
to note and for the American people to 
know that Iran is the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terrorism. Do you 
know who it points that terrorism to? 
Isn’t it interesting. Iran tends to have 
little bywords. It says: This is our 
goal—to destroy America, to destroy 
Israel. That is what Iran has been up 
to. It has nurtured a proxy network 
that has helped it to claw its way into 
the heads of regional leaders who are 
either too weak or who are wholly un-
willing to resist those overtures. 
Relationships with Russia and with 
Bashar al-Assad in Syria have kept Ira-
nian leaders a part of mainstream con-
versations about national security. 
Hezbollah in Lebanon is a close 
friend of Iran, and their support of mi-
litias and Houthi rebels in Yemen adds 
to the aura of chaos around Iran’s ac-
tivities. 
So what does all of this have to do 
with a targeted strike on one man? 
That one man has spent a lifetime 
doing exactly what he was doing the 
day he died—using violence and intimi-
dation to bring Shiite ideology into 
prominence and, to quote the notorious 
Ayatollah Khamenei, ‘‘end the cor-
rupting presence of America in the 
Middle East.’’ 
That is what they thought. Those are 
their 
comments, 
their 
words—not 
mine, not the President’s, not the mili-
tary’s, not the intel’s—the Ayatollah’s. 
That is what he said. 
Soleimani took to the frontlines with 
the Revolutionary Guard in 1979. That 
may trigger some thoughts of Jimmy 
Carter, Ronald Reagan, and American 
diplomats and citizens that were held 
hostage. 
Soleimani was not a new arrival to 
the terrorist community. Sometime 
between 1997 and 1998 he was named 
commander of the Quds Force. Under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
Revolutionary 
Guard has gained control of over 20 
percent of Iran’s economy, and the 
Quds Force has extended its influence 
to all Gulf States, Lebanon, Syria, 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Central Asia. 
He controlled Iran’s intervention in 
support of Assad in Syria and was the 
primary architect of Hezbollah in Leb-
anon. They have built up and trained 
scores of Hezbollah and Houthi fight-
ers, as well as Shiite militias in Syria 
and Iraq, and those Iraqi militias killed 
more than 600 U.S. troops during the 
Iraq War. 
Soleimani made much of his mili-
taristic role, but he was a general in 
name only. He hid behind a uniform 
while designing, devising, conducting, 
and advising terror plots, and that is 
what earned him a spot on the list of 
people sanctioned by the EU, the 
United States, and the U.N. He wasn’t 
a bureaucrat. He was not one of many 
respected generals. 
The Ayatollah called him a living 
martyr in his lifetime, but I intend to 
call him exactly what he was—a ruth-
less terrorist and a shameless, even 
proud, engineer of hatred, death, and 
destruction. That is his legacy. 
His tendency toward violence as a de-
fault was thrown into full relief when 
President Trump withdrew from that 
Iranian nuclear deal, just as I said a 
moment ago. 
In early May of last year, the intel 
indicated an increased threat from 
Tehran, and between May and Sep-
tember, Iran and its proxies per-
petrated more than 80 violent attacks 
in the region—80—on us and our allies, 
80 attacks. They attacked multiple 
tankers and commercial vessels. They 
downed an American drone. They took 
out 5 percent of the world’s oil supply. 
Now we find out that they have taken 
out a jetliner. 
They used their own drones to attack 
a Saudi airport. A suicide bomber mur-
dered four Afghans and wounded four 
U.S. troops traveling in a convoy in 
eastern Kabul. 
Soleimani was very confident, but 
perhaps he should have thought a little 
harder about the increased level of vul-
nerability he had built into his expand-
ing network, because he didn’t die in a 
hidden bunker or behind the walls of a 
fortified compound. He died in public 
while traversing the Middle East, de-
fining impunity and even taking selfies 
with proxy terrorists. He did every bit 
of this in violation of U.N. resolutions. 
He 
died 
because 
his 
aggression 
morphed into a pattern of arrogance 
and violent escalation that U.S. offi-
cials could not, in good conscience, 
continue to allow. 
This month Iranian officials lost 
their chief terrorist, but they have 
gained an opportunity, and, I will tell 
you, the ball is in their court. 
Their retaliatory strikes against our 
shared bases in Iraq did nothing to re-
pair their image as a belligerent and 
deeply vulnerable regime. If their lack 
of precision was calculated, no one got 
the intended message. 
The Iranians are now left with two 
choices, and they are theirs. Pick one. 
We hope they choose well. 
Option No. 1, they can come to the 
table and behave like a normal coun-
try. They are a country rich in re-
sources and smart, educated people. 
Come to the table and behave like a 
normal country in the community of 
nations and allow deterrence to make a 
comeback. 
Option No. 2, they can risk being re-
minded that the United States will de-
fend to the death the redline that sepa-
rates justice from chaos, and the Amer-
ican people are going to make certain 
that we continue to go after monsters 
who crusade as the declared enemies of 
freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
TRIBUTE TO LAUREN OPPENHEIMER 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I want 
to take a few moments to recognize an 
individual, Lauren Oppenheimer, who, 
after nearly 5 years as an invaluable 
member of my team, has recently 
moved on to begin the next chapter of 
her career. We all on Team Merkley 
are very sad to see her go, but we do 
feel extraordinarily fortunate that she 
hasn’t gone far—just over to Senator 
JONES’ office on the other side of the 
Hart building. So Oregon’s loss has 
been Alabama’s gain. 
Lauren joined my team in 2015, back 
when I was a member of the Banking 
Committee, to handle that important 
portfolio. It was a position that she 
was extremely qualified for, having a 
wealth of experience working on those 
issues in both the House and at the 
Center for American Progress. But 
then a seat opened on the Foreign Re-
lations Committee, and I had to turn in 
my credentials for Banking in order to 
take that Foreign Relations position. 
Well, we knew that that really kind 
of undermined the vision of why 
Lauren had come to our team, to really 
take on that set of banking issues. It 
would not be an understatement to say 
it was not a completely thrilling day 
when I shared this news with her. 
But being the dedicated team mem-
ber that she is, she willingly and gra-
ciously took on a new role within the 
team and a whole new portfolio of 
issues to work on—issues like election 
reform and telecom, judicial nomina-
tions, rules reform. It might not have 
been the job that she signed up for, but 
she excelled at it nonetheless. She ex-
celled because she is extremely smart 
and talented and because she is pas-
sionate about her work, and she threw 
herself into this new set of issues. 
I mean it when I say she is pas-
sionate. A quick conversation about 
Fintech can last for hours, as she 
excitedly informs you about all of the 
recent developments in that emerging 
industry—an industry, by the way, 
that I had hardly heard of before 
Lauren came to my team. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: 
‘‘Human progress is neither automatic 
nor inevitable.’’ It requires ‘‘the tire-
less exertions and passionate concern 
of dedicated individuals.’’ Well, Lauren 
is certainly one of those dedicated and 
passionate individuals, and throughout 
her time on Team Merkley, she has 
helped move our country forward in 
ways large and small. 
For years she has worked on ensuring 
the implementation of the Volcker 
rule, a key part of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which closed the Wall Street casino by 
separating old-fashioned banking from 
high-risk, high-leverage bets on the fu-
ture prices of stocks and exchange 
rates and interest rates and commod-
ities—bets that placed our entire bank-
ing system and economy at risk. 
Lauren wrote the bipartisan SAFE 
Banking Act, which had its hearing in 
the Banking Committee just a couple 
of months ago, to ensure that legal

cannabis and hemp businesses have ac-
cess to the same banking services as 
any other business. She established the 
Senate Cannabis Working Group to co-
ordinate the Senate’s efforts around 
this issue. 
She has worked to ensure the integ-
rity of our judicial system by vetting 
the nominations for judgeships and, in 
one case, produced significant insights 
and records that resulted in the Senate 
rejecting 
the 
nomination 
of 
Ryan 
Bounds for the 9th Circuit. 
In her spare time, Lauren has been 
fighting to save our democracy. Earlier 
this year she created my ‘‘Blueprint 
For Democracy’’ to introduce six spe-
cific bills, and she was the point person 
on my team for finalizing the Senate 
version of the For the People Act, a 
comprehensive 
election 
reform 
bill 
which takes on anti-democratic prac-
tices such as gerrymandering, voter 
suppression, and dark money. 
But beyond those accomplishments 
and many others that I haven’t men-
tioned, she made one contribution that 
I will always remember and deeply ap-
preciate. As many are aware, I spent a 
significant amount of time over the 
last year and a half shining a light on 
the Trump administration’s policy of 
cruelty toward immigrants, refugees, 
and asylum seekers on our southern 
border. 
Even though immigration issues are 
not in her portfolio, it was Lauren who 
inspired me to get involved. I was read-
ing the speech by former Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions—a speech labeled 
his ‘‘zero tolerance’’ speech—and the 
name didn’t strike me as unexpected. 
But when I read the details, it sounded 
as if the plan was to discourage refu-
gees from coming to our border by de-
liberately traumatizing children, to rip 
them out of their parents’ arms. 
I refused to believe that any Amer-
ican administration would ever actu-
ally do this, and, as I was expressing 
the belief that no American adminis-
tration would ever resort to hurting 
children as a strategy to deter immi-
gration and would not resort to a strat-
egy of hurting children to do anything 
that is not acceptable under any moral 
code or set of ethics or religious stand-
ards, it was Lauren who said: There is 
one way to find out, and that is to go 
down to the border. 
So I went that next weekend, that 
next Sunday, and became the first 
Member of Congress to see the children 
being sorted into cages after being sep-
arated from their parents and to be 
turned away from any conversation in 
front of a former Walmart where I had 
heard that hundreds of separated boys 
were being held. 
The video of that really sent a mes-
sage to the entire Nation of what this 
administration was hiding, but the fact 
that I was there at that processing cen-
ter and the fact that I was there at 
that former Walmart, seeking to find 
out what was going on with those hun-
dreds of boys who had been taken from 
their parents, was because Lauren 
Oppenheimer said: The best way to find 
out is to go down to the border your-
self. 
Thank you, Lauren, for playing such 
a critical role in all of these efforts. 
You are such a valued member of our 
team, and you are still valued as a 
member of our team. You will always 
be a member of our team, even as you 
go on to work for our colleague from 
Alabama. 
Our office notices your absence, with-
out the energy and enthusiasm ema-
nating from your desk and your un-
ceasing willingness to take on new 
challenges and your very valuable 
work to mentor other team members. 
Know that all of us on the team wish 
you the very best as you continue to 
fight for a better world in this new 
chapter of your career. 
I am excited that you are returning 
to your world of expertise, the world of 
banking. I may be calling you now and 
then to get your insights on that set of 
issues that you know so well. 
All of us look forward to seeing the 
insights and understanding you will 
help us gain from your perspective 
when you are fully immersed in the 
banking world. It will be valuable to 
all of us in the Senate and valuable to 
our Nation. 
I thank you for your service.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The Senator from Florida. 
IRAN 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
President Trump is working to defend 
the freedom of our country. He was 
right to take swift and decisive action 
to kill one of the world’s worst mon-
sters. Soleimani was responsible for 
the death and maiming of thousands of 
Americans 
and 
tens 
of 
thousands 
worldwide. He ordered the attack on 
the United States Embassy in Iraq. He 
had plans to kill more Americans. 
There are some in this body who are 
trying to curtail the President’s au-
thority to defend Americans and defend 
American interests. This is not only 
foolish; it is fool hardy. Our President 
does and should have the authority to 
defend Americans, period, but it is an 
authority he doesn’t take lightly. 
President Trump is right to use re-
straint and avoid further escalation 
unless Iran continues their provo-
cations. 
The regime in Iran—a regime that 
chants ‘‘Death to America’’ and wants 
to wipe Israel off the face of the map— 
needs to know that the United States 
will not tolerate acts of aggression 
against America or our allies. The 
death of Soleimani was a strong warn-
ing, but they should also know they 
have the opportunity to become pro-
ductive members of the world commu-
nity and bring peace and prosperity to 
their people. The choice is theirs. We 
all want peace, and the greatest deter-
rent to war is our economic and mili-
tary strength, but Iran must make the 
choice for peace. It is a choice that is 
theirs alone. 
During this trying time, I want to 
pause and take a moment to remember 
the brave men and women of our 
Armed Forces. We often forget in 
Washington that the people carrying 
out the orders of our Commander in 
Chief are just that—people. They are 
not pieces on a chess board. They are 
fathers and mothers, sons and daugh-
ters, brothers and sisters. 
I remember my father talking about 
his experience in World War II—a con-
flict he certainly had no expectation to 
return from. He loved his service to our 
country but never forgot those we lost. 
I remember friends going to Vietnam 
and Korea. I have spent many hours 
sitting and talking with Gold Star par-
ents. As Governor, I watched Florida 
National Guard units leave for wars in 
the Middle East. 
The cost of war is great. As Ronald 
Reagan said, ‘‘Freedom is not bought 
cheaply.’’ We should never forget that. 
I am praying for our brave men and 
women in uniform—some of them Flo-
ridians—headed overseas to protect 
Americans and prevent an escalating 
conflict, and I am praying for peace. 
These heroes put their lives in danger 
to defend our Nation, and we cannot 
thank them enough for their sacrifice 
and their service. We must recognize 
the dangers and threats that our world 
faces today, and we must always stand 
together united to defend freedom and 
democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
REMEMBERING JOCELYN BIRCH BURDICK 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, on the 
day after Christmas, former Senator 
Jocelyn Burdick died in Fargo, ND, at 
the age of 97. 
Jocelyn served only 30 days, rough-
ly—or 3 months, maybe, at the most— 
in the United States Senate while she 
filled the vacancy that was created by 
the death of her husband, the longtime 
United States Senator, Quentin Bur-
dick. During those 3 months, Jocelyn 
was able to cast votes as her husband 
would have cast them and to support 
his staff after his death and through 
the transition to fill the vacancy in a 
special election. Jocelyn will forever 
hold a place in North Dakota history 
as North Dakota’s first woman United 
States Senator. 
However, her service in North Da-
kota goes far beyond those 3 months 
she served in the Senate. All of us Sen-
ators know the importance and the in-
credible service of our spouses. Jocelyn 
stood by Quentin’s side for 32 years 
while he served our State here in this 
important body. 
Throughout her life, Jocelyn em-
braced her place in public life with tre-
mendous grace, dignity, and class. She 
demonstrated by example how people 
can be principled in their beliefs, yet 
friendly, 
cordial, 
even 
affectionate 
while having different political views. I 
am honored to be standing here using 
her desk—Quentin’s desk. To be a part 
of this heritage is a great honor for me. 
The impact of her life well lived can 
be seen in countless ways, especially as 
a philanthropist, as a political and 
community volunteer, and certainly as 
a woman of deep faith. Jocelyn’s mem-
ory will remain alive in the hearts of 
all of those who had the privilege to 
know her. 
Kris and I join Senator HOEVEN and 
Mikey, and many, many North Dako-
tans in sending our condolences and 
our best wishes to the Burdick family. 
We pray that fond memories and the 
deep affection so many people held for 
Jocelyn will comfort them in these 
days and the days ahead. I pray that 
God will bless Jocelyn Burdick’s mem-
ory. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today I 
rise, along with my colleague Senator 
CRAMER, to honor former Senator from 
North Dakota Jocelyn Burdick. She 
was the first woman to represent the 
State of North Dakota in the U.S. Sen-
ate. My wife Mikey and I were sad-
dened to hear of her recent passing, 
and we want to extend our sincere con-
dolences to all of the Burdick family. 
As I said, I, along with Senator 
CRAMER, have introduced a resolution 
to honor Senator Jocelyn Burdick and 
her service to the people of North Da-
kota and the United States in this 
body. 
Jocelyn was born in Fargo, ND. She 
attended Principia College and North-
western University and began her ca-
reer as a radio announcer in Moorhead, 
MN. 
On September 12, 1992, Jocelyn Bur-
dick became the first woman from the 
State of North Dakota to serve in the 
U.S. Senate. She was appointed by 
then-Governor George Sinner to fill the 
seat of her late husband, Quentin Bur-
dick, whom she served alongside during 
his 32 years in this body, the U.S. Sen-
ate. The Burdick family has a long his-
tory of public service. 
During her time in the Senate, she 
helped to establish the Quentin N. Bur-
dick Indian Health Program at the 
University 
of 
North 
Dakota, 
sup-
porting healthcare training programs 
for Native Americans, and helped to se-
cure funding for the Federal court-
house in Fargo named after her late 
husband. 
Jocelyn was a Sunday school teacher 
and devoted member of the Christian 
Science Church. She served as presi-
dent of the local Parent Teacher Asso-
ciation, recorded public service an-
nouncements raising awareness of sub-
stance abuse and drunk driving, and 
was nationally recognized for her phi-
lanthropy on behalf of the Gamma Phi 
Beta sorority. 
I knew Jocelyn Burdick, and she was 
a fine person. I join with the people of 
North Dakota in expressing our appre-
ciation for her service on behalf of our 
State and our Nation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Ohio. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the 
fall of 2016, just 4 years ago, I heard 
Candidate Trump repeatedly promise 
to get rid of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement—to pull out of it, to 
renegotiate it, or to fix it so that it 
worked better than it did. 
I didn’t support Donald Trump for 
President. I think he has been a less 
than honest President with whom I dis-
agree in terms of his character and in 
terms of his work product, but that is 
really not the point. The point was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S117 
January 9, 2020 
that I liked what he said about getting 
out of NAFTA. I know what NAFTA 
did to the Presiding Officer’s home 
State of Indiana. I know what it did to 
Dayton, OH; to Cleveland, OH; to Can-
ton, OH; to Youngstown, Toledo, Mans-
field, Springfield, Zanesville, and to al-
most every community in my State. So 
I welcomed the President’s saying that. 
The reason I thought these trade 
agreements were so bad for our country 
was that these trade agreements were 
always written by corporate interests 
to serve the needs of the executives and 
the major stockholders of the corpora-
tions. In fact, they not only were not 
written for workers, but they under-
mined workers. I have never voted for 
a trade agreement. I voted against 
NAFTA, and I voted against the Cen-
tral American Free Trade Agreement. I 
voted against permanent normal trade 
relations with China—one after an-
other after another—because I saw that 
these trade agreements were written 
for corporate interests and that they 
betrayed workers. 
What happened is that companies 
would shut down production in Canton 
or in Niles or in Bryan or in Lima, and 
they would move overseas, build fac-
tories there, and sell those products 
back into the United States. That was 
what happened with these trade agree-
ments. Corporations liked them be-
cause they could exploit low-income 
workers. They liked them because 
their profits could be greater. They 
liked them because they had no respon-
sibility to their workers when they 
would move overseas and sell the prod-
ucts back. That was their mission. 
That was the way these companies did 
business. So I welcomed the President’s 
doing that. 
Then, about a year ago, the President 
presented the new NAFTA. He called it 
the 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement, the USMCA. When he pre-
sented it to the Congress, it was more 
of the same. It was almost exactly the 
same. It had a few little tweaks, but 
fundamentally the President again be-
trayed the workers, as all of these 
trade agreements do. The President’s 
bill, the President’s USMCA, was again 
a giveaway to corporate interests. In 
fact, there was a provision in there for 
the drug companies that was maybe 
worse than I had ever seen in a trade 
agreement. The White House, I admit, 
does look like an executive retreat for 
drug company executives except on 
Tuesdays and Fridays, when it looks 
like a retreat for Wall Street execu-
tives. 
The President presented this USMCA 
to us, and it was the same ol, same ol. 
It fundamentally would mean more 
jobs would be outsourced, more profits 
for corporations, and more exploitation 
of low-wage workers. Because of his 
USMCA, even more companies would 
shut down in Lima or in Zanesville or 
in Gallipolis or in Portsmouth or in 
Chillicothe and move overseas to look 
for cheap labor and weaker labor laws 
so they would make more money. So 
this President betrayed workers again 
by giving us a trade agreement that 
was no better than the ones he had 
campaigned against. 
Yet, this year, a number of us—Sen-
ator WYDEN of Oregon, Speaker PELOSI, 
Congresswoman 
DELAURO
of 
Con-
necticut, and organized labor—banded 
together and said: No, Mr. President. 
We are not going to pass another cor-
porate trade agreement. We are not 
going to pass another special interest 
trade agreement that sells out workers 
and enriches corporate executives over 
and over. We are not going to buy that 
again. We are saying no to that. Then 
we said: We will support your USMCA 
only if you include strong language for 
workers. 
So we got the Brown-Wyden amend-
ment in this agreement. 
Finally, after a year—the President 
fundamentally refused to talk to us 
about it, and the U.S. Trade Rep re-
fused to seriously include this lan-
guage—they realized: Wait a second. If 
we don’t do this, we will never get an-
other USMCA. So just a few weeks ago, 
President Trump and U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative Lighthizer finally agreed 
to put in strong labor language. 
Do you know what that means? It 
means that the center of our trade 
agreement now—the center of our 
trade policy—is workers. Workers are 
now at the center of our trade policy, 
not corporate interests that send jobs 
overseas, not pharmaceutical compa-
nies that make even more money when 
they go to China, not other kinds of 
corporations that outsource their jobs 
and have their whole business plans un-
dermining workers. 
Do you know what else that means? 
It is good news for places like Gallip-
olis and Zanesville and Mansfield and 
Lima and Chillicothe and Columbus 
and Dayton and all of these commu-
nities in my State. It is good news for 
them because, for the first time, they 
can look to our trade policy and see 
that workers are the center of that 
trade policy. 
In years and years here, I have never 
voted for a trade agreement. I have al-
ways opposed NAFTA and CAFTA and 
PRT with China. Last week, in the 
Committee on Finance, because they 
included Brown-Wyden, because work-
ers are now at the center of our trade 
policy, I cast my vote for a trade agree-
ment that will matter, that will help 
workers in my State. It is a good move. 
It means not just that this trade agree-
ment will be better; it means, in the fu-
ture, that any President who wants to 
pass a trade agreement will have to do 
what we did this year over the resist-
ance of President Trump. He will have 
to do what we did this year and put 
workers at the center of our trade pol-
icy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, if I 
go back 21⁄2 years, there was a lot of 
turmoil and a lot of conversation about 
the President of the United States’ 
stepping into the issue of trade, specifi-
cally in North America, for it was a 
settled issue between Canada and Mex-
ico. Yet we asked the question: Should 
we revisit NAFTA? 
At that time, a lot of people said that 
the trade agreement was complicated 
and hard and that we shouldn’t touch 
the trade agreement, that we should 
just leave it alone. With all of its warts 
and all of its faults, it is what it is. 
Don’t touch it. 
Instead, the President chose to step 
into the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and say: No. We are going 
to renegotiate this deal. It is 25 years 
old, and it needs a revisit. Against the 
many people who were pushing against 
him, he pushed through that and said: 
Let’s start all over again. 
In the past 21⁄2 years, the Trump team 
has renegotiated the deal and brought 
it back to Congress, where it passed 
with 
overwhelming 
bipartisan 
sup-
port—finally—in the House. It sat on 
the House’s desk for 14 months before 
those in the House took it up. Finally, 
after 14 months of their not taking it 
up, they passed it with overwhelming 
bipartisan support. It has now gone 
through the Committee on Finance 
here in the Senate with a vote of 25 to 
3, and it is headed toward the floor of 
the Senate, to the President’s desk, 
and finally to getting this issue re-
solved about North American free 
trade. 
Now, with this issue between Canada 
and Mexico, I have had some folks ask 
me: Why is it such a big issue? It is a 
big issue because Canada and Mexico 
are our No. 1 and No. 2 trading partners 
in the world. Far and away, Canada and 
Mexico are our biggest trading part-
ners. Our trade relationships are essen-
tial not just to every border State but 
to States like my State. In Oklahoma, 
Canada and Mexico are also our biggest 
trading partners. They are vital to our 
economic success and have been key to 
what has happened in NAFTA over the 
last 25 years. 
Yet now, after all of the negotiations 
and all of the noise, we finally have a 
revised area in trade that has needed to 
be addressed with things like intellec-
tual property, which is a new chapter 
in what is now called the USMCA or 
what people call NAFTA 2.0. This sim-
ple change is not so simple when trying 
to deal with intellectual property 
theft, whether it be a camcorder re-
cording in a movie theater somewhere 
in Mexico, whether they sell pirated 
copies, which has been an issue, or 
whether it is just the ownership of pat-
ents and how things actually move 
from place to place. Can you confiscate 
property that is illegally produced at 
each border crossing, and how is that 
managed? That is addressed for the 
first time in this agreement—trying to 
protect American patent owners from 
not having their patents stolen once 
they leave and go to Canada or Mexico. 
Twenty-five years ago, digital trade 
was not a major issue in NAFTA. Obvi-
ously, it is a very significant issue for

January 9, 2020 
us now, and it is finally addressed in 
this agreement, as well as how we are 
going to handle digital services and 
digital trade. 
There is something very important 
to my State, and that is agricultural 
trade and how agricultural goods are 
going to move. Now, the vast majority 
of this USMCA agreement lines up ex-
actly with the NAFTA of the past, but 
there are some areas that were prob-
lems in the NAFTA of the past that 
had to be addressed, one of those being 
wheat, for instance. 
When wheat moved from the United 
States into Canada, Canada down-
graded that wheat to a lower grade so 
that our Oklahoma farmers would get 
less profit for that because they down-
graded that wheat as it moved across 
the Canadian border. This agreement 
settles that issue. That was just Cana-
dian protectionism. It wasn’t that the 
wheat was of a lesser quality; it was 
just that they were trying to protect 
Canadian wheat instead of having an 
actual free market. 
This is a free trade area. The tariffs 
and the fees go away across North 
America if we can have a level playing 
field. In areas in which we don’t have a 
level playing field, like with Oklahoma 
wheat competing with Canada’s wheat, 
we are taking that on. I feel confident 
that Oklahoma wheat is going to win 
that fight, and given this new trade 
agreement, we get the opportunity to 
win that. 
There are lots of areas in the agree-
ment that help us in agriculture. There 
are areas in digital trade and intellec-
tual property, as well as in multiple 
other areas of manufacturing. That is 
why so many groups and so many indi-
viduals have looked at this and have 
gone back to the Trump administra-
tion, with some of my Democratic col-
leagues begrudgingly swallowing hard 
and saying: This is a good agreement 
for America in the future. This does 
help us keep jobs here. This helps us 
continue to have a level playing field 
for trade. 
I congratulate the Trump adminis-
tration for its 21⁄2 long years of very 
hard work to get to this agreement. I 
am grateful that we are nearing an 
agreement with China, a phase No. 1 
agreement. It is much needed because 
China has been a major problem in in-
tellectual property theft and in its hav-
ing an unfair trading platform. I am 
grateful the administration has also 
completed the first stage of a major, 
new 
trade 
agreement 
with 
Japan. 
Those are our four largest trading part-
ners, and it is significant to our econ-
omy not just in the short term but in 
the long term that we continue to have 
stable free trade areas in as many 
places as we can. 
I am confident in the American 
worker. When given the opportunity to 
compete, we win because of the quality 
of our work, the quantity of our work, 
and the creativity of the inventions we 
put out from this country. Let’s keep 
doing that. Let’s keep winning around 
the world in our trade agreements. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

TRIBUTE TO DOUG AND APRIL MOORE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
the end of the week here, a Thursday 
at least, on the Senate floor, and it is 
that time of the week that I usually 
come down and talk about somebody 
who is making my State such a great 
place to live in, somebody who is doing 
great things for their community, 
somebody I refer to as a group or indi-
viduals as our Alaskan of the Week. 
So this is kind of exciting. The pages 
usually see this as the most exciting 
speech of the week because they learn 
about Alaska. 
This is our first Alaskan of the Week 
of the year. I am sure the Presiding Of-
ficer is even excited about that. It is 
actually the first one of the whole dec-
ade, so stand by. 
Now, usually I give these speeches 
and talk a little bit and update about 
what is going on in Alaska. 
I just spent a glorious holiday, New 
Year’s, Christmas in Anchorage and 
Fairbanks over the last couple weeks. 
We passed the winter solstice. That is 
the shortest day of the year. Now, it 
might not feel like that in Alaska, but 
actually the days are getting longer, 
getting more sunlight, but the cold has 
hit, winter has come. 
In Anchorage, our largest city, my 
hometown, 
temperatures 
just 
last 
weekend when I was home were drop-
ping into the 15-below-zero range. In 
the interior of Alaska—that is a little 
more north—it hit 65 below zero in 
Manley Hot Springs on December 27. 
That rivals the winter temperature on 
Mars. OK? It is cold. 
I was in Fairbanks. That is part of 
the 
interior, 
beautiful 
Fairbanks, 
where it has been close to 40 below the 
last couple weeks. I went out and took 
a run. I am not sure I realized it was 
that cold. It was only about 20 below on 
my run. It was kind of cold, but it was 
still a nice run. We have a lot of folks 
who get out and enjoy the beautiful 
winter, beautiful temperatures. 
I mentioned in the interior—the ele-
mentary school in Nenana recently 
posted that they were going to cancel 
school if it hit 55 below zero. 
So these are tough people, especially 
having just witnessed Washington, DC, 
close the whole darn city because they 
had a half inch of snow, but I am di-
gressing here. 
We live in extremes in Alaska, but, 
for many of us, that is exactly why we 
live in Alaska. Toughing out these ex-
treme temperatures together certainly 
makes us closer, brings communities 
together, makes people rely on each 
other. We are a huge State geographi-
cally, but a small, tight-knit State in 
terms 
of 
population, 
and 
we 
get 
through things like these tough win-
ters, really cold winters, by gathering 
together in small and large places all 
across the State, places of warmth, 
particularly when it is cold outside. 
So today I would like to recognize an 
Alaskan couple who has provided one 
of those places of warmth for the com-
munity of Talkeetna and the sur-
rounding areas. Talkeetna is about 100 
miles north of Anchorage. It is a must- 
visit stop when you come to Alaska. 
Why? Well, it is absolutely beautiful. It 
is the gateway to Denali National 
Park, and if you would like to take a 
flightseeing tour of Denali, it almost 
certainly is going to take off in 
Talkeetna. 
So I encourage everybody who is 
watching here in the Gallery or on TV, 
you have to come to Alaska. You have 
to visit—winter, summer, fall, spring, 
it doesn’t matter. You will have the 
best trip of a lifetime. Go to Talkeetna. 
It is also a unique town in many 
ways—Alaska unique. It was the model 
for the TV show, many years ago, 
‘‘Northern Exposure.’’ Its honorary 
member for 10 years was a cat named 
Stubbs. So you get the picture. It is a 
town filled with generous and warm 
people who love their State, their com-
munities, their country. 
Our Alaskans of the Week today are 
Doug and April Moore. They are the 
owners of an iconic store in Talkeetna, 
Moores’ Hardware and Building Supply. 
It is a hardware store with a heart and 
a place for the community to gather, 
particularly in the winter, and it is a 
place that the Moores run to reflect 
the value of families and communities 
that they hold so dear. 
So let me tell you a little bit about 
the Moores. Doug’s parents and his 
brother moved from Anchorage to 
Talkeetna in 1981, when Doug was a 
preteen and his parents wanted to live 
in a smaller community, smaller than 
Anchorage, and they wanted to own 
their own business. So they chose a 
tool store housed in a Quonset hut. 
Like many small business owners all 
across Alaska, all across America, they 
got to work—hard work, long hours, 
but that is what they did. 
The younger Moores worked at the 
store when they were growing up, but 
Doug chose to be a surveyor when he 
was in college, and eventually he ran 
into April, his wife, at a restaurant in 
Talkeetna. Because it is a small town, 
they knew each other. They had grown 
up just a quarter mile apart, but things 
clicked at that restaurant. 
After they got married, Doug and 
April decided they wanted to run the 
family business, the hardware store, 
and they wanted it to stay in the fam-
ily. 
Fast forward to now. If you live in 
Talkeetna, and you want to build a 
house, you want to make repairs, you 
need a hammer, a nail, or just for a cup 
of coffee, their store is more than 10,000 
square feet, with a staff of about 20, 
with more in the summer. The staff 
loves the place. They love the Moores 
because they are great people, great 
owners, dedicated owners. 
Here is how one employee describes 
working for them: 
You will never find anyone like them any-
where.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S119 
January 9, 2020 
They are amazing people, what they do to 
us personally—they take care of us. They 
make sure we are taken care of. If we have 
family issues, they understand and do every-
thing they can to help. 
Doug recently said: 
We’re a family-oriented business. The fam-
ilies of the people who work for us are very 
important. The kids of our employees have 
grown up in the business. 
Both of their parents have been to-
gether for 50 years, and Doug and April 
have been together 25. These are really 
important milestones, really impor-
tant examples. 
As Doug said, ‘‘We really believe 
that’s one of the big problems with 
America right now—families not stay-
ing together. We live our values.’’ 
The Moores are also heavily involved 
in the community. April was a Girl 
Scout leader and a PTA member. Doug 
was the president of the community 
council, a volunteer emergency med-
ical technician, a volunteer firefighter. 
They help on Thanksgiving with the 
food bank, as well as the local gun club 
and firing range. They give where they 
can. They give back to the community. 
They are integrated in the community. 
Last summer, a series of wildfires 
ravaged through Southcentral Alaska. 
The most destructive of these fires was 
the 3,700-acre McKinley fire. It de-
stroyed 51 homes, 3 businesses, and 84 
outbuildings. Thank God, nobody in 
Alaska was killed. 
As one of the largest hardware stores 
servicing that region where that fire 
was, Moores’ Hardware and Building 
Supply stepped up, donating time, 
equipment, and giving to people who 
needed help, people who needed to re-
build. 
We often talk about how small busi-
nesses are the backbone of our coun-
try’s economy, but here is the thing. 
They are also the backbone of our com-
munities. 
In small towns throughout America 
or throughout Alaska, businesses are 
not just places for people to go and 
shop for things. They can also be places 
where people get together, where peo-
ple give to one another. 
In fact, they are often the glue that 
holds communities together. This is 
what Moores’ Hardware and Building 
Supply is. I have had the honor of 
going there, shopping there, seeing this 
great store and community in action. 
Now, one of the Moores’ sons, Justin, 
is in training to take over the store 
when Doug and April finally retire. It 
will then be an official third-genera-
tion small business in the great State 
of Alaska. What a great accomplish-
ment that will be. 
Justin is committed, just like Doug 
and April, to their employees and their 
communities. So I want to thank the 
Moores. In fact, I want to thank all 
small business owners across Alaska 
and across the country for your hard 
work. 
Doug and April, thank you not just 
for that hard work but for all you are 
doing for the community of Talkeetna 
and the surrounding areas and for the 
great State of Alaska. 
Congratulations on being our first 
Alaskan of the Week of 2020.

TRIBUTE TO CARTER HENDRICKS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
my good friend Carter Hendricks pre-
pares to end his service as the mayor of 
Hopkinsville, he certainly has a lot to 
show for his years of leadership in 
Southwestern Kentucky. He has helped 
the region take full advantage of its 
great potential, and I know I join his 
friends and constituents in expressing 
our gratitude. Today, I would like to 
honor this remarkable Kentuckian and 
wish him well as he embarks on his 
next chapter. 
When he was first elected in 2014, 
Carter made headlines for becoming 
the second youngest mayor in Hopkins-
ville’s two centuries of history. The 
local newspaper, the highly regarded 
Kentucky New Era, also reported that 
Carter was only the city’s second Re-
publican mayor. He quickly mobilized 
the city’s administration with a bold 
strategy to make Hopkinsville an at-
tractive destination for economic de-
velopment. 
His 
flagship 
initiative, 
called ‘‘Hoptown WINS,’’ was a nearly 
$15 million capital campaign involving 
downtown improvements, as well as 
new parks, a sports complex, and a 
visitors center. These state-of-the-art 
amenities are meant to help draw in-
vestment and good jobs into Hopkins-
ville and the surrounding areas. Now 
halfway through his second term, Car-
ter and his constituents are beginning 
to see the positive results of his leader-
ship. His vision of Hopkinsville’s bright 
future is helping to create the condi-
tions for growth and prosperity. 
Carter had been encouraging eco-
nomic growth in the region long before 
he first stepped foot into the mayor’s 
office. For nearly a decade, Carter 
worked in senior positions at the Chris-
tian County Chamber of Commerce, in-
cluding 4 years as its president and 
CEO. With local leaders and the busi-
ness community, he helped develop cre-
ative solutions to the county’s chal-
lenges. 
I have had the great privilege to 
work with Carter in both of these ca-
pacities. When I heard the area’s lack 
of access to a Federal interstate was 
obstructing business investment, Car-
ter and I teamed up to find a solution. 
In 2017, Senator RAND PAUL and I se-
cured the designation of a nearby sec-
tion 
of 
the 
Edward 
T. 
Breathitt 
Pennyrile Parkway as Interstate 169. 
When President Trump signed our pro-
vision into law, he helped connect 
Christian County to the Federal inter-
state system and bolstered Carter’s ef-
forts to encourage growth in the area. 
We also partnered to support the 
brave men and women stationed at 
Fort Campbell in Christian County. 
The installation is part of Kentucky’s 
critical role in our national defense 
structure, and the local community 
takes seriously its responsibility to 
support Fort Campbell’s mission and 
the servicemembers stationed there. 
During his time with the chamber, Car-
ter led the business community’s ef-
forts to be strong and supportive neigh-
bors. Together, we wanted to welcome

all members of the military and their 
families to Kentucky, make them feel 
at home, and help them prosper in this 
community. 
Carter said he didn’t take the deci-
sion to leave the mayor’s office lightly. 
When the chance to lead the South 
Western Kentucky Economic Develop-
ment Council became available, how-
ever, he leapt at the opportunity. 
Formed in 2012, the organization rep-
resents Christian, Todd, and Trigg 
Counties and engages with job creators 
looking for their new home. Carter ad-
mits the job will present new chal-
lenges, but I am confident he will bring 
the same knowledge, determination, 
and high energy that has led to so 
much success. 
Although the city will certainly miss 
Carter’s daily leadership, he said, ‘‘I’m 
not leaving the team—if anything I’m 
just in a slightly different position.’’ 
At the economic development council, 
Carter will continue supporting the 
city’s efforts and continue working to-
ward the same goal. He is certainly 
lucky to have a proud cheering section 
in his wife Faye and their two children. 
I would like to thank Carter for his 
constant dedication to creating oppor-
tunities for families in West Kentucky 
and to congratulate him on his great 
achievements. I hope my Senate col-
leagues will join me in commending 
this talented Kentuckian for his lead-
ership and service and in extending our 
best wishes as he steps into a new role. 
Mr. President, the Kentucky New Era 
in Hopkinsville recently published a 
profile of Carter’s distinguished serv-
ice. I ask unanimous consent that the 
article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Kentucky New Era, Jan. 7, 2020] 
HENDRICKS SHARES WHY HE PURSUED 
POSITION WITH EDC 
(By Zirconia Alleyne) 
Hopkinsville Mayor Carter Hendricks an-
nounced Monday afternoon that he will re-
sign in order to accept the executive director 
position with the South Western Kentucky 
Economic Development Council. 
His official resignation letter and date 
were not released as of press time Monday. 
Hendricks, who is in his second term as 
mayor, called a meeting with city staff at 
the same time the SWKEDC met across town 
Monday to determine he was the best can-
didate for the role left vacant in November 
when Mark Lindsey resigned. 
The Kentucky New Era broke the news 
shortly after the EDC came out of closed ses-
sion. 
Hendricks had just wrapped his meeting 
with staff telling them he was a candidate 
and would accept the position if offered. He 
said he didn’t know going into the meeting 
knowing that he was selected, although 
there had been chatter on social media 
throughout the weekend. 
‘‘I went out on a limb by having that meet-
ing, knowing that I could have had egg on 
my face if it didn’t go the way I was praying 
for it to go,’’ he said. ‘‘But, that’s the risk 
you take sometimes.’’ 
Why he applied? 
Hendricks, who served as the executive di-
rector of the Christian County Chamber of 
Commerce from 2010 to 2013, said he has al-
ways been interested in economic develop-
ment and thought about pursuing the posi-
tion with the regional EDC in 2017 when 
Lindsey was ultimately named the director. 
‘‘There’s been a couple other times I was 
interested in that position, but the timing 
never felt right,’’ Hendricks said. ‘‘The rea-
son I was willing to step forward now and 
show interest is because I have a passion for 
it, I believe I have a skillset for it and I 
know I have experience in it. It was inevi-
table that I would be looking for something 
different in the next two to two and a half 
years, and I cannot afford to wait until the 
next opportunity arises.’’ 
Hendricks said he expected Lindsey to be 
in the position for five to seven years like 
national trends show, and he hoped to apply 
once his second term in office was done. 
However, 
when 
the 
opportunity 
arose 
again in November, Hendricks said he ex-
pressed interest. He went on to say he had no 
contact with the EDC board members after 
his interview in December, except the board 
chair to ask about the hiring process. 
The South Western Kentucky Economic 
Development Council was formed in 2012 
through a merger of the Todd County Indus-
trial Foundation with the Christian County 
Economic Development Council, according 
to New Era archives. In May 2014, the Cadiz- 
Trigg County Economic Development Com-
mission joined forces with the two. 
The executive director works to recruit 
businesses and industry to the tri-county re-
gion. Hendricks said the new job will be a 
challenge, but he’s up for it. 
‘‘A lot of my dad’s family is from Trigg 
County . . . and I’ve got great working rela-
tionships with the mayors and judge execu-
tives, and I’ve worked hard to maintain 
those relationships,’’ Hendricks said. ‘‘I’m 
still going to have to learn more about Todd 
County and Trigg County, but I’m eager to 
do that.’’ 
STEPS TO APPOINTING A NEW MAYOR 
According to KRS 83A.040, Hendricks must 
submit a formal resignation letter with his 
final date before the process to appoint an 
interim mayor can begin. 
The statute explains that his resignation 
shall be effective at the next regular or spe-
cial meeting of city council after the date 
specified in his letter of resignation. City 
council will then have 30 days to fill the va-
cancy with an interim mayor. 
The statute goes on to explain that the in-
terim mayor can serve until the next suc-
ceeding annual election, at which time the 
vacancy will be filled by election for the re-
mainder of the term. The next general elec-
tion is in November. 
The mayor’s assistant, Idalia Luna, is leav-
ing at the end of January for her new role 
with the city as executive director of the 
Human Rights Commission. The mayor said 
he didn’t look for her replacement because 
the next mayor should choose the person for 
that role. 
‘‘I intentionally didn’t fill that role until I 
knew how this would turn out,’’ Hendricks 
said. 
Of the empty mayor’s office that will be 
left, Hendricks said the staff is equipped to 
keep the city afloat. ‘‘People like to believe 
that the mayor is the one running the city, 
but if you’re doing your job correctly, the 
credit is to these city employees,’’ he said. 
‘‘I care a lot about this team,’’ he contin-
ued. ‘‘I spent five years with them and had a 
heart attack with them—and I don’t say that 
lightly. This team rallied around me and 
they showed up—they showed up in the hos-
pital, they sent cards and notes. They’ll be 
my family no matter what role I’m in as 
long as I’m in this community. They’re good 
people.’’ 
HENDRICKS’ TIME IN OFFICE 
Hendricks was elected for his first term as 
mayor of Hopkinsville in November 2014. Ac-
cording to New Era archives, Hendricks be-
came only the second Republican mayor in 
the city’s history. Herb Hays was the first 
when he was elected in 1985 and died in office 
in 1987. 
Hendricks said he wouldn’t trade his time 
as mayor for anything, but he acknowledged 
that it was a tough job. 
When asked about the stress of being 
mayor, Hendricks said he believes a variety 
of things contributed to his heart attack on 
Christmas Eve 2016. 
‘‘When I first had the health scare, I was 
running on the greenway, so it’s not that I 
wasn’t a healthy person,’’ he said. ‘‘. . . More 
than anything it was genetic. My dad passed 
away at 64 from heart disease and had his 
first heart attack at 46. 
‘‘Sure, I have to believe that some of the 
pressure and stress of this job contributed to 
(my heart attack),’’ he recalled. ‘‘At the 
time, we were really working on the WINS 
initiative to get it approved, and I’m a pret-
ty Type A personality when I believe in 
something . . . those types of characteristics 
combined with genetics and too many Dr. 
Peppers contributed to a heart attack when 
I was 43.’’ 
Hendricks’ Hoptown WINS initiative, an 
acronym for Wellness, Infrastructure and 
Neighborhood, was a major part of his first 
term. The $14.8 million in capital projects 
came to fruition through a tax increase 
voted on by city council. The result? The 
construction of the Planters Bank-Jennie 
Stuart Health Sportsplex, a series of down-
town improvements, extensions to the Hop-
kinsville Rail Trail greenway system, two 
neighborhood parks, the completion of the 
visitor’s center on East Ninth Street and 
more sidewalks around town. 
‘‘Everything we did in the Hoptown WINS 
initiative had economic development in 
mind,’’ he said. ‘‘If you look at what eco-
nomic developers and site planners will tell 
you, there’s about five things that are the 
most important criteria for communities to 
be successful. One of those is quality of 
place—walkability, performing arts facilities 
like the Alhambra theatre, youth activities 
. . . those types of things matter. 
‘‘You have to be a desirable community for 
industries to want to invest in you,’’ he con-
tinued. ‘‘Those are the types of projects that 
industries and workers are looking for, so 
nearly everything we’ve done has been to try 
to position our self to take better advantage 
of economic development opportunities.’’ 
Hendricks said he had the support of his 
wife, Faye, and their two children, Chase and 
Lily, when he pursued the position. He also 
said he prayed. 
‘‘I know that sounds cliche´, but as a result 
of prayer and speaking with the family, I de-
cided to pursue this opportunity knowing 
that it wasn’t an ideal time,’’ he said. 
‘‘There isn’t an ideal timeline when you’re 
serving in an elected position and thinking 
about what you’re going to do next.’’ 
Hendricks said he has no plans to leave his 
hometown anytime soon and he doesn’t plan 
to run for any other elected positions. For 
now, Hendricks said he hopes to make posi-
tive change in the community through his 
new role at the EDC. 
‘‘What I hope people will see after it’s all 
said and done is . . . I’m not leaving the 
team—if anything I’m just in a slightly dif-
ferent position of the team,’’ he said. ‘‘If you 
think I’ve been the quarterback, I’m now the 
wide receiver, and my job as this wide re-
ceiver is to go deep and score touchdowns 
and recruit business and industries that will 
help this community grow and provide more 
opportunities for families.’’

January 9, 2020 
MONROE COUNTY BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, at 
the beginning of a new year, most of us 
look ahead with plans, expectations, 
and resolutions. The residents of Mon-
roe County in the Pennyroyal region of 
South Central Kentucky, however, are 
spending the first days of the new year 
looking back on their unique history. 
They are looking two centuries back, 
in fact, to the county’s founding in 
1820. I would like to join with these 
Kentuckians in kicking off a year of bi-
centennial celebrations of the county’s 
blessings and its rich heritage. 
At its founding, local leaders looked 
to Presidential leadership when select-
ing the name for the county and its 
seat. President James Monroe was hon-
ored with the county’s name while his 
Vice President, Daniel Tompkins, was 
the inspiration for the county seat’s 
name, Tompkinsville. 
Early Monroe County residents took 
advantage of the area’s fertile soil and 
its close proximity to the Cumberland 
and Barren Rivers. In this beautiful 
setting, they began developing deep ag-
ricultural roots with livestock and sta-
ple crops like tobacco and hemp. 
Like 
many 
Kentucky 
counties, 
Monroe’s early economic development 
was stunted during the Civil War. 
Many local residents joined the war ef-
fort, and support for the Union led to 
the establishment of Camp Anderson 
and the raising of the 9th Kentucky In-
fantry. Unfortunately, Monroe Coun-
ty’s location on the Kentucky-Ten-
nessee border also caused multiple in-
vasions by both Union and Confederate 
forces throughout the war. During one 
of these raids, a Confederate unit cap-
tured Tompkinsville and burned much 
of the town, including the courthouse, 
causing lasting devastation. 
Although the local economy was slow 
to rebound immediately after the war, 
the new century helped Monroe County 
get back on track. Since that time, 
families in the region have continued 
developing their rural traditions while 
making important investments into 
new local industries. A little over a 
decade ago, I was proud to partner with 
local officials in Monroe County to de-
liver Federal funding for a new water 
treatment facility, along with other 
upgrades. Together, we are helping to 
encourage new opportunities for eco-
nomic growth and good jobs for Ken-
tucky families. 
In addition, I greatly enjoy working 
with a proud son of Tompkinsville, 
Congressman JAMES COMER, who is a 
strong champion for his hometown and 
all of the First District of Kentucky 
here in Washington. 
The yearlong bicentennial celebra-
tion will feature a wide range of Mon-
roe County’s history, as well as some of 
its local specialties. From its famous 
barbecue to a Gospel music event, the 
festivities will showcase the many tal-
ents of Monroe County families. They 
will also pay tribute to local veterans, 
honoring the county’s long and distin-
guished record of contributing to our 
Nation’s defense. 
In celebrating their wonderful his-
tory, these Kentuckians are also pre-
paring to take advantage of their great 
potential ahead. With the principled 
leadership 
of 
Congressman 
COMER, 
State Representative Bart Rowland, 
County Judge/Executive Mitchell Page, 
and many other local officials, Monroe 
County is well-positioned for a bright 
future. It has been a privilege to help 
kick-off this bicentennial celebration, 
and I ask my Senate colleagues to join 
me in congratulating all the residents 
of Monroe County on this milestone. 
Together, we look forward to many 
more prosperous years to come.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–06 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–35B Short Take-Off and Vertical 
Landing (STOVL) aircraft is a single-seat, 
single-engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-gen-
eration, multirole aircraft. It contains sen-
sitive technology including the low observ-
able airframe/outer mold line, the Pratt and 
Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG–81 radar, an 
integrated core processor central computer, 
mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a 
multiple sensor suite, technical data/docu-
mentation, and associated software. Sen-
sitive elements of the F–35B are also in-
cluded in operational flight and maintenance 
trainers. 
a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a 
single 40,000-lb thrust class engine designed 
for the F–35 and assures highly reliable, af-
fordable performance. The engine is designed 
to be utilized in all F–35 variants, providing 
unmatched commonality and supportability 
throughout the worldwide base of F–35 users. 
The Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing 
(STOVL) propulsion configuration consists 
of the main engine, diverter-less supersonic 
inlet, a three (3) Bearing Swivel Module, Roll 
Posts and Duct Assembly System, and Lift 
Fan. 
b. The AN/APG–81 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) is a high processing 
power/high transmission power electronic 
array capable of detecting air and ground 
targets from a greater distance than me-
chanically scanned array radars. It also con-
tains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 
which creates high-resolution ground maps 
and provides weather data to the pilot, and 
provides air and ground tracks to the mis-
sion system, which uses it as a component to 
fuse sensor data. 
c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System 
(EOTS) provides long-range detection and 
tracking as well as an infrared search and 
track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared 
(FLIR) capability for precision tracking, 
weapons delivery, and bomb damage assess-
ment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple 
separate internal or podded systems typi-
cally found on legacy aircraft. 
d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aper-
ture System (EODAS) provides the pilot with 
full spherical coverage for air-to-air and air- 
to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
enhancements, a fire control capability, and 
precision tracking of wingmen/friendly air-
craft. The EODAS provides data directly to 
the pilot’s helmet as well as the mission sys-
tem. 
e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
reprogrammable, integrated system that 
provides radar warning and electronic sup-
port measures (ESM) along with a fully inte-
grated countermeasures (CM) system. The 
EW system is the primary subsystem used to 
enhance situational awareness, targeting 
support and self-defense through the search, 
intercept, location, and identification of in- 
band emitters and to automatically counter 
TR and RF threats. 
f. The Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers and Intelligence/Commu-
nications, Navigation, and Identification 
(C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with un-
matched connectivity to flight members, co-
alition forces, and the battlefield. It is an in-
tegrated subsystem designed to provide a 
broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and 
data communications, precision radio navi-
gation and landing capability, self-identi-
fication, beyond visual range target identi-
fication, 
and 
connectivity 
to 
off-board 
sources of information. It also includes an 
inertial navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) for precise location informa-
tion. The functionality is tightly integrated 
within the mission system to enhance effi-
ciency. 
g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes 
two data links, the Multi-Function Advanced 
Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The MADL 
is designed specifically for the F–35 and al-
lows for stealthy communications between 
F–35s. Link 16 data link equipment allows 
the F–35 to communicate with legacy air-
craft using widely distributed J-series mes-
sage protocols. 
h. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Global 
Sustainment (ALGS) provides a fully inte-
grated logistics management solution. ALGS 
integrates a number of functional areas in-
cluding supply chain management, repair, 
support equipment, engine support, and 
training. The ALGS infrastructure employs 
a state-of-the-art information system that 
provides real-time, decision-worthy informa-
tion for sustainment decisions by flight line 
personnel. 
Prognostic 
health 
monitoring 
technology is integrated with the air system 
and is crucial to predictive maintenance of 
vital components. 
i. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Informa-
tion System (ALIS) provides an intelligent 
information infrastructure that binds all the 
key concepts of ALGS into an effective sup-
port system. ALIS establishes the appro-
priate interfaces among the F–35 Air Vehicle, 
the warfighter, the training system, govern-
ment information technology (IT) systems, 
and supporting commercial enterprise sys-
tems. Additionally, ALIS provides a com-
prehensive tool for data collection and anal-
ysis, decision support, and action tracking. 
j. The F–35 Training System includes sev-
eral training devices to provide integrated 
training for pilots and maintainers. The 
pilot training devices include a Full Mission 
Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission 
Rehearsal Trainer (DMRT). The maintainer 
training devices include an Aircraft Systems 
Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection Sys-
tem Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer 
Mold Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear 
Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, Fl35 Engine 
Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Train-
er (WLT). The F–35 Training System can be 
integrated, where both pilots and maintain-
ers learn in the same Integrated Training 
Center (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and 
maintainers can train in separate facilities 
(Pilot Training Center and Maintenance 
Training Center). 
k. Other subsystems, features, and capa-
bilities include the F–35’s low observable air-
frame, Integrated Cure Processor (ICP) Cen-
tral Computer, Helmet Mounted Display Sys-
tem (HMDS), Pilot Life Support System, Off- 
Board Mission Support (OMS) System, and 
publications/maintenance 
manuals. 
The 
HMDS provides a fully sunlight readable, bi- 
ocular display presentation of aircraft infor-
mation projected onto the pilot’s helmet 
visor. The use of a night vision camera inte-
grated into the helmet eliminates the need 
for separate Night Vision Goggles (NVG). 
The Pilot Life Support System provides a 
measure of Pilot Chemical, Biological, and 
Radiological Protection through use of an 
On-Board 
Oxygen 
Generating 
System 
(OBOGS); and an escape system that pro-
vides additional protection to the pilot. 
OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Man-
agement System (PTMS) air and enriches it 
by removing gases (mainly nitrogen) by ad-
sorption, thereby increasing the concentra-
tion of oxygen in the product gas and sup-
plying breathable air to the pilot. The OMS 
provides a mission planning, mission brief-
ing, and a maintenance/intelligence/tactical 
debriefing platform for the F–35. 
2. The Reprogramming Center is located in 
the U.S. and provides F–35 customers a 
means to update F–35 electronic warfare 
databases. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures, which might reduce weapon sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Singapore can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This proposed sale is necessary to 
further the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be 
derived from this sale, as outlined in the Pol-
icy Justification, outweigh the potential 
damage that could result if the sensitive 
technology were revealed to unauthorized 
persons. 
5. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of 
Singapore.

TRIBUTE TO BRIDGETT FREY 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize an outstanding mem-
ber of my staff who is moving on to 
pursue other opportunities, my long- 
time 
communications 
director, 
Bridgett Frey. 
Bridgett joined my office at the start 
of 2009, when President Barack Obama 
was first inaugurated and I was serving 
in 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives. 
Things were so busy then that her 
interview took place in a hallway in 
the Capitol. She may have recognized 
that as a sign of things to come, but I 
am grateful she took the job anyway. 
Through the decade that has fol-
lowed, Bridgett has been a dedicated 
staffer and trusted adviser. Regardless 
of the issue of the day—from local 
issues like Federal grant funding and 
helping struggling auto dealers, to na-
tional issues like healthcare reform 
and economic policy, to international 
issues like Russian election inter-
ference and North Korean sanctions— 
she helped ensure that my office com-
municates 
clearly 
and 
effectively 
about our work in Congress. She has 
worked tirelessly to inform the public 
about the policy changes we have 
achieved and those we still hope to ac-
complish. 
Whenever I took on a new challenge, 
Bridgett was there to help. She led 
communications in my personal office, 
as well as working with Speaker

PELOSI’s team to help freshman com-
munications directors learn the ropes 
of Capitol Hill when I was assistant to 
the Speaker. She then took on a new 
challenge and dual role when I became 
ranking member of the House Budget 
Committee. From budget battles to the 
not-so-Super Committee, she was al-
ways up to the task. She took a leave 
of absence to help in my 2016 campaign 
for the Senate and then moved across 
the Capitol to run the communications 
operation in my Senate office. She has 
approached all of it with intelligence, 
sharp instincts, sound judgment, and a 
sense of humor. 
Bridgett has built a reputation for 
being hard-charging and forthright, 
and reporters respect her responsive-
ness and honesty. She has coordinated 
closely with all aspects of my team, 
helping to drive both policy work and 
State outreach efforts, as well as with 
countless offices in both the House and 
the Senate. She has always provided 
me with honest and thoughtful advice 
and counsel. She has an uncanny in-
stinct for getting to the heart of any 
issue. 
As Bridgett seeks new challenges 
outside our office, I know she will con-
tinue to grow in her professional ca-
reer. It stems from a love of politics 
that she got from her father and an 
ethos of hard work from her mother. I 
deeply appreciate her many years of 
dedicated service to the people of 
Maryland and the Congress. Our entire 
team will miss her, but we all extend 
our warmest wishes as she takes on 
new adventures.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TIM MCALLISTER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Tim McAllister, a 96-year-old veteran 
who served in World War II. Tim is cur-
rently the oldest veteran living in Ju-
dith Basin County. 
Tim is a humble man who speaks 
quietly about his military service. In 
fact, he spends more time reflecting on 
the service of his two brothers, both of 
whom were soldiers in the D-Day inva-
sion at Normandy. Tim’s military serv-
ice took him to the South Pacific, 
where he was engaged in the liberation 
of the Philippines with the American 
Division in the region of Cebu City. 
Tim’s impact on the community is 
pronounced. This past November, Tim 
wasn’t able to attend the Veterans Day 
celebration at the local elementary 
school, and his presence was missed. 
Because of his absence, students in 
first and second grade at the school 
made a massive card to thank him for 
his service and delivered it to his 
home. This small act of kindness was 
very meaningful to Tim. 
Tim’s roots in Montana run strong 
and deep. His father rode the range 
with the legendary Charlie M. Russell. 
Tim carried on those western values 
from his father and developed a love for 
ranching and horses. Tim truly under-
stands and loves the Montana way of 
life. 
I am proud of Tim for his service to 
our country and his tremendous impact 
on his community. I am confident his 
legacy of service will live on for gen-
erations to come, and I am honored to 
recognize him today.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CALVIN BAKER 
∑ Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, in 
April of 1981, President George H.W. 
Bush said ‘‘think about every problem, 
every challenge, we face. The solution 
to each starts with education.’’ These 
words were true then, and they are just 
as true today. Education is the bedrock 
of our society, and it allows our coun-
try to advance. 
It is difficult to think of someone 
who 
exemplifies 
President 
Bush’s 
words more than Vail School District 
Superintendent Calvin Baker. I have 
been privileged to get to know Cal and 
his wife Nancy over the last many 
years. I also live in Vail School Dis-
trict—VSD—so I have seen the impact 
he has made in our community first-
hand. 
Cal moved back to Arizona in 1987 to 
become the principal of the only school 
in the Vail School District, serving 500 
students. He was appointed as the su-
perintendent of the district in 1988 and 
has been at the helm ever since. During 
his nearly 33 years of service to stu-
dents and families in our community, 
Cal led the growth to now 22 schools 
serving 
over 
14,000 
students. 
The 
growth was not by accident. Families 
want to move to VSD so their kids can 
experience the world-class educational 
experience thanks to Cal’s extraor-
dinary leadership and success. 
As with any organization, leadership 
matters, and for effective leadership, 
character matters. Calvin Baker sets 
the example of integrity, selfless serv-
ice, and humility for all to follow. He is 
truly a good man. 
In his tenure, Cal built an impressive 
team of educators and support staff 
and created a culture of innovation, 
parent involvement, and dedication to 
students. Cal’s vision for success was 
based on the principle that education is 
a community effort. He has been the 
glue that kept our growing and diverse 
community together united with a 
common goal of educational excel-
lence. In a recent letter Cal sent to 
parents in his district, he said, ‘‘I en-
courage each of you to invest deeply in 
your child’s education and our local 
schools. It is that investment that is 
the ‘secret sauce’ of Vail’s success.’’ 
Calvin Baker is a trailblazer on inno-
vation in education for so many other 
districts in the State and country to 
follow. Empire High School was the 
first school in the United States to 
eliminate textbooks in favor of com-
puters. He pioneered the Beyond Text-
books program that combines Vail’s 
successful instructional methodology 
with an online delivery system. Cal 
didn’t just want Vail students to ben-
efit from this effective approach. Now, 
115 school districts across Arizona and 
six other States use this program, 
some of which have become top per-
forming districts in their States. 
Baker’s creative and visionary lead-
ership didn’t stop there. When enroll-
ment in the district surpassed capac-
ity, he developed a year-round track 
system to ensure educational standards 
were high while new infrastructure was 
planned and built. Under his leader-
ship, Vail schools are consistently la-
beled as ‘‘A+’’ by the Arizona Depart-
ment of Education. 
Calvin Baker’s legacy is immense 
and immeasurable. It will continue on 
with the thousands of children in a 
generation who received an amazing 
education in Vail School District under 
his leadership, propelling them on a 
path of opportunity for their futures. 
Cal 
is 
the 
longest 
serving 
super-
intendent of any school district in Ari-
zona and has left an indelible mark on 
education for Arizona and the country. 
Appropriately, Pima County passed a 
resolution naming December 20 as Cal-
vin Baker Appreciation Day, an honor 
in which Cal is more than deserving. 
Last year, Cal confronted another 
challenge when he was diagnosed with 
multiple myeloma. His example of 
faith, grit, and courage as he faced the 
diagnosis and treatment continues to 
be an inspiration to us all. 
I want to personally thank Cal for 
his service and wish him, Nancy, and 
their whole family all the best in his 
much-deserved retirement.∑

resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 466 
Whereas, on January 2, 2020, United States 
personnel 
killed 
terrorist 
leader 
Qasem 
Soleimani during the course of a targeted 
strike against terrorists engaged in planning 
imminent attacks against United States per-
sons and personnel; 
Whereas Qasem Soleimani was the leader 
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps- 
Quds Force (IRGC–QF) terrorist organiza-
tion, a global terrorism threat to the United 
States and the international community; 
Whereas Qasem Soleimani was the archi-
tect of terrorist attacks in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, and elsewhere that killed hundreds of 
United States personnel, including with 
weapons and improvised explosives provided 
directly by the IRGC–QF; 
Whereas Qasem Soleimani planned or sup-
ported numerous other deadly terrorist at-
tacks against the United States and its al-
lies, including the 2011 plot to assassinate 
the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United 
States Adel al-Jubeir while he was in the 
United States and the December 31, 2019, at-
tack on the United States Embassy in Bagh-
dad, Iraq, as well as planned attacks in Ger-
many, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Kenya, Bahrain, 
Turkey, and elsewhere; 
Whereas, under Presidents George W. Bush 
and Barack Obama, the Department of the 
Treasury designated Qasem Soleimani for 
the imposition of sanctions under Executive 
Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to 
blocking property and prohibiting trans-
actions with persons who commit, threaten 
to commit, or support terrorism) for plotting 
to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambas-
sador to the United States, under Executive 
Order 13382 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to 
blocking property of weapons of mass de-
struction proliferators and their supporters) 
based on Qasem Soleimani’s relationship to 
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and 
under Executive Order 13572 (50 U.S.C. 1701 
note; relating to blocking property of certain 
persons with respect to human rights abuses 
in Syria); 
Whereas the valiant members of the United 
States Armed Forces have courageously and 
vigorously pursued the IRGC–QF and its af-
filiates in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the 
world; 
Whereas the anonymous, unsung heroes of 
the intelligence community of the United 
States have pursued the IRGC–QF and its af-
filiates in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the 
world with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, 
and professionalism; 
Whereas, although the death of Qasem 
Soleimani represents a significant blow to 
the IRGC-QF and its affiliates and to ter-
rorist organizations around the world, ter-
rorism remains a critical threat to the na-
tional security of the United States; 
Whereas Qasem Soleimani and the IRGC– 
QF have provided critical support to the re-
gime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and pur-
sued the targeted killing and ethnic cleans-
ing of hundreds of thousands of Sunni Mus-
lims across the Middle East; and 
Whereas the IRGC–QF supports terrorist 
groups around the world, including Kata’ib 
Hezbollah, the Taliban, Lebanese Hezbollah, 
Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Pal-
estine-General Command, and under Presi-
dents George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump, 
the Department of the Treasury designated 
the IRGC–QF for the imposition of sanctions 
under Executive Order 13224 for providing 
material support to terrorist organizations 
and as a foreign terrorist organization: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) declares that the death of Qasem 
Soleimani represents a measure of justice 
and relief for the families and friends of the 
hundreds of men and women of the United 
States who lost their lives in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, the men and women around the 
world who have been killed by other attacks 
sponsored by the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC–QF), and the 
men and women of the Armed Forces and the 
intelligence community of the United States 
who have sacrificed their lives pursuing 
Qasem Soleimani and the IRGC–QF; 
(2) commends the men and women of the 
Armed Forces and the intelligence commu-
nity of the United States for the tremendous 
commitment, perseverance, professionalism, 
and sacrifice they displayed in disrupting 
imminent 
terrorist 
attacks 
planned 
by 
Qasem Soleimani; 
(3) commends the men and women of the 
Armed Forces and the intelligence commu-
nity of the United States for committing 
themselves to defeating, disrupting, and dis-
mantling the IRGC–QF; 
(4) commends the President for ordering 
the successful operations to locate and 
eliminate Qasem Soleimani; and 
(5) reaffirms its commitment to disrupting, 
dismantling, and defeating the IRGC–QF and 
affiliated organizations around the world 
that threaten the national security of the 
United States and to bringing terrorists to 
justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S129 
January 9, 2020 
Whereas, since passage, the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives has refused to 
transmit the articles to the Senate, unless 
the Senate agrees to allow the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives to dictate the 
rules of a trial; 
Whereas, the Constitution of the United 
States does not provide the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives with the power to 
effectively veto a resolution passed by a duly 
elected majority of the House of Representa-
tives by refusing to transmit such a resolu-
tion to the Senate; 
Whereas, the refusal by the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives to transmit the ar-
ticles is a flagrant violation of the separa-
tion of powers expressly outlined in the bi-
cameral impeachment process under the 
Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas, this inaction by the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives is a gross in-
fringement on the constitutional authority 
of the Senate to try impeachments; 
Whereas, the refusal by the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives to transmit the ar-
ticles is unprecedented for presidential im-
peachments; 
Whereas, refusing to transmit the articles 
is resulting in the denial of President 
Trump’s day in court; and 
Whereas, if allowed to stand, this inaction 
by the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives would set a dangerous precedent for the 
constitutional system of Government in the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate calls on the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives to 
immediately appoint impeachment managers 
and transmit the articles of impeachment to 
the Senate for disposition consistent with 
the Constitution of the United States.

SECTION 
5(C) OF THE WAR POWERS RESO-
LUTION TO TERMINATE THE USE 
OF 
UNITED 
STATES 
ARMED 
FORCES 
TO 
ENGAGE 
IN 
HOS-
TILITIES IN OR AGAINST IRAN 
Mr. UDALL submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. CON. RES. 33 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), 
SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES TO ENGAGE 
IN 
HOSTILITIES 
IN 
OR 
AGAINST 
IRAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Government of Iran is a leading 
state sponsor of terrorism and engages in a 
range of destabilizing activities across the 
Middle 
East. 
Iranian 
General 
Qassem 
Soleimani was the lead architect of much of 
Iran’s destabilizing activities throughout the 
world. 
(2) The United States has an inherent right 
to self-defense against imminent armed at-
tacks. The United States maintains the right 
to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel 
serving abroad. 
(3) In matters of imminent armed attacks, 
the executive branch should indicate to Con-
gress why military action was necessary 
within a certain window of opportunity, the 
possible harm that missing the window 
would cause, and why the action was likely 
to prevent future disastrous attacks against 
the United States. 
(4) The United States has national inter-
ests in preserving its partnership with Iraq 
and other countries in the region, including 
by— 
(A) combating terrorists, including the Is-
lamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); 
(B) preventing Iran from achieving a nu-
clear weapons capability; and 
(C) supporting the people of Iraq, Iran, and 
other countries throughout the Middle East 
who demand an end to government corrup-
tion and violations of basic human rights. 
(5) Over the past eight months, in response 
to rising tensions with Iran, the United 
States has introduced over 15,000 additional 
forces into the Middle East. 
(6) When the United States uses military 
force, the American people and members of 
the United States Armed Forces deserve a 
credible explanation regarding such use of 
military force. 
(7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
1541 et seq.) requires the President to consult 
with Congress ‘‘in every possible instance’’ 
before introducing United States Armed 
Forces into hostilities. 
(8) Congress has not authorized the Presi-
dent to use military force against Iran. 
(b) TERMINATION.—Pursuant to section 5(c) 
of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
1544(c)), Congress hereby directs the Presi-
dent to terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or 
against Iran or any part of its government or 
military, unless— 
(1) Congress has declared war or enacted 
specific statutory authorization for such use 
of the Armed Forces; or 
(2) such use of the Armed Forces is nec-
essary and appropriate to defend against an 
imminent armed attack upon the United 
States, its territories or possessions, or its 
Armed Forces, consistent with the require-
ments of the War Powers Resolution. 
(c) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section may be construed— 
(1) to prevent the President from using 
military force against al Qaeda or associated 
forces; 
(2) to limit the obligations of the executive 
branch set forth in the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.); 
(3) to affect the provisions of an Act or 
joint resolution of Congress specifically au-
thorizing the use of United States Armed 
Forces to engage in hostilities against Iran 
or any part of its government or military 
that is enacted after the date of the adoption 
of this concurrent resolution; 
(4) to prevent the use of necessary and ap-
propriate military force to defend United 
States allies and partners if authorized by 
Congress consistent with the requirements of 
the War Powers Resolution; or 
(5) to authorize the use of military force.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 2020 CON-
GRESS-BUNDESTAG/BUNDESRAT 
EXCHANGE 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, since 1983, 
the U.S. Congress House and Senate and the 
German Bundestag and Bundesrat have con-
ducted an annual exchange program for staff 
members from both countries. The program 
gives professional staff the opportunity to ob-
serve and learn about each other’s political in-
stitutions and interact on issues of mutual in-
terest. 
A staff delegation from the U.S. Congress 
will be selected to visit Germany from Friday, 
May 22–Sunday, May 31, 2020. During this 
exchange, the delegation will attend meetings 
with Bundestag/Bundesrat party staff mem-
bers, and representatives of numerous polit-
ical, business, academic and media agencies. 
A comparable delegation of German staff 
members will visit the United States from Sat-
urday, June 20–Sunday, June 27, 2020. They 
will attend similar meetings in Washington. 
The 
Congress-Bundestag/Bundesrat 
Ex-
change is highly regarded in Germany and the 
United States and is one of several exchange 
programs sponsored by public and private in-
stitutions in the United States and Germany to 
foster better understanding of the politics and 
policies of both countries. This exchange is 
funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bu-
reau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. 
The U.S. delegation should consist of expe-
rienced and accomplished Hill staff who can 
contribute to the success of the exchange on 
both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag re-
ciprocates by sending senior staff profes-
sionals to the United States. 
Applicants should have a demonstrable in-
terest in events in Europe. Applicants need 
not be working in the field of foreign affairs, al-
though such a background can be helpful. The 
composite U.S. delegation should exhibit a 
range of expertise in issues of mutual concern 
to the United States and Germany such as, 
but not limited to, trade, security, the environ-
ment, economic development, health care, 
and other social policy issues. This year’s del-
egation should be familiar with transatlantic re-
lations within the context of recent world 
events. 
Please note that there is a significant time 
commitment aspect for those selected for the 
program. In addition, U.S. participants are ex-
pected to plan and implement the meetings 
and programs for the Bundestag/Bundesrat 
staff members when they visit the United 
States. 
Members of the House and Senate who 
would like a member of their staff to apply for 
participation in this year’s program should di-
rect them to submit a resume and cover letter 
in which they state their qualifications, the 
contributions they can make to a successful 
program and some assurances of their ability 
to participate during the time stated. 
Applications should be sent to the Office of 
Interparliamentary Affairs, HC–4, the Capitol, 
by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 26. Ques-
tions may be directed to Ms. Kate Knudson at 
202–226–1766.

CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH 
MARK ROBERTS 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, as a source 
of inspiration and drive for every student who 
walks onto his track, Colorado’s Lyons High 
School Head Cross Country Coach Mark Rob-
erts is a prime example of the kind of coach 
we all hope our children have. I am so proud 
that his many years of tireless work at Lyons 
High is being honored by his induction into the 
Colorado High School Coaches Association 
Hall of Fame this March. 
Raised in Colorado and a runner himself 
since high school, Coach Roberts is well-re-
nowned throughout Colorado’s running com-
munity and has expertly coached countless 
track and field students to victory. During 
Coach Roberts tenure, the Lyons boys and 
girls cross country and track and field teams 
won a combined 18 state championships and 
were runners-up an equal number of times. In 
2013 alone, the Lyons High boys runners 
placed first, second and third to record the 
only perfect team score in state history. This 
past fall, Lyons also won every possible cham-
pionship—boys and girls individual titles, as 
well as boys and girls team titles—joining just 
one other school as the first to do so since 
1995. 
In addition to his clear talent for coaching 
students to victory, Coach Roberts has also 
been the meet director for the St. Vrain Invita-
tional track and St. Vrain Invitational cross 
country meets. These are two of the largest 
meets in Colorado and Coach Roberts has 
added innovative and exciting components to 
them, to not only inspire the participating ath-
letes, but also to ensure these events are en-
gaging for families and, truly, our entire com-
munity. 
Coach Roberts is clearly an irreplaceable 
asset to the running and sports communities 
throughout Colorado and to every student ath-
lete he serves, and his induction into the Colo-
rado High School Coaches Association Hall of 
Fame is very well earned. Colorado’s 2nd 
Congressional District and our entire state 
send our congratulations to Couch Roberts 
and wish him and the Lyons team continued 
victory on the field.

SARY OF ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA 
SORORITY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the old-
est Greek-letter organization established by 
African American college-educated women in 
the United States, on its one hundred twelfth 
anniversary. 
Founded in 1908 on the campus of Howard 
University in Washington, D.C., Alpha Kappa 
Alpha’s sisterhood has grown to more than 
one thousand chapters worldwide with more 
than seventy-five thousand members strong. 
Michigan alone is home to more than thirty 
chapters, several of which serve the Wayne 
County and metropolitan Detroit regions. 
Alpha Kappa Alpha was founded with a goal 
of bringing like-minded women together to up-
lift each other, using their bond, strengths, and 
passions to benefit others. This sisterhood has 
created a vast network of sisters in service 
who work on countless community projects 
each year. The sisters of Alpha Kappa Alpha 
have focused their efforts to uplift the most 
vulnerable and impoverished individuals and 
advancing human and civil rights everywhere. 
Please join me in recognizing Alpha Kappa 
Alpha on this outstanding milestone as we 
wish them many more years to come.

the efforts made by educators to realign peda-
gogical practices to allow for student em-
powerment and engagement. This relies on a 
comprehensive platform that supplements the 
breadth of academic rigor with collaboration 
and social support. Through programs ranging 
from dual immersion to positive behavior inter-
vention, these schools reconcile differences in 
theory and praxis to close achievement gaps 
and instill traits vital to academic success. 
What results is a seamless integration be-
tween teacher guidance and student participa-
tion. It is this attunement to the holistic well- 
being of each student that sets Distinguished 
Schools apart. 
As a strong believer in education and its 
life-changing advantages, there is nothing 
more pleasing than knowing that the commu-
nity I serve is paving a brighter road for the 
academic future of California’s youth. I am 
proud of the tireless efforts made by parents, 
teachers, administrators, and staff to advance 
a scholastic agenda that rewards integrated 
educational experiences. Madam Speaker, I 
ask that you and my honorable colleagues join 
me in congratulating these ten California Dis-
tinguished 
Schools 
for 
this 
tremendous 
achievement in the world of education. I am 
wholeheartedly assured in their ability to guide 
and leave a lasting impact on the students of 
California’s 39th District.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
(LTC) RYAN NENANBER 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Ryan Nenanber for 
his retirement from the United States Army 
after over 20 years of service. 
LTC Nenanber’s record of service with the 
U.S. Army is truly outstanding. He began his 
career in 2000 when he was stationed in Ft. 
Wainwright, Alaska and served as an Anti- 
Tank Platoon Leader, Rifle Platoon Leader, 
Company Executive Officer, and Battalion As-
sistant Operations Officer. LTC Nenanber then 
served as a Special Forces Operational De-
tachment ALPHA Commander and an Ad-
vanced Operational Base Executive Officer in 
Fort Lewis, Washington. He spent time teach-
ing our next generation of servicemembers at 
the U.S. Military Academy, and then was as-
signed to the U.S. Army North as a Strategic 
Intelligence Officer. LTC Nenanber has been 
deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and multiple lo-
cations in Asia. Currently, LTC Nenanber is 
the Chief of the Functional Training Branch at 
the United States Army Intelligence Center of 
Excellence. 
I 
want 
to 
specifically 
recognize 
LTC 
Nenanber’s leadership when he commanded 
an Operational Detachment ALPHA team that 
captured the leaders of an Al-Qaeda affiliated 
cell north of Baghdad, Iraq that used young 
boys as suicide bombers. Through their brave 
actions, LTC Nenanber and his team saved 
countless young boys—many thought to be or-
phans—from certain death, and prevented the 
execution of many disastrous suicide bomb-
ings. 
Originally 
from 
Belle 
Fourche, 
LTC 
Nenanber is a native South Dakotan and I am 
proud to have such an exceptional service-
member call South Dakota home. Our state 
and country are better because of citizens like 
him. I thank LTC Nenanber and his family for 
their tremendous sacrifice, and I extend my 
deepest congratulations for his retirement.

COMMEMORATING 
JOE 
BURROW 
WINNING THE 2019 HEISMAN ME-
MORIAL TROPHY 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Louisiana State University’s 
quarterback, Joe Burrow, for winning the 
Heisman Memorial Trophy. As the most pres-
tigious award in college football, this honor is 
afforded to the most outstanding player who 
has exhibited excellence and integrity both on 
and off the field. Through hard work and dedi-
cation, Joe has exemplified these qualities, 
and there is no other college athlete more de-
serving of this award. 
On December 14, 2019, Joe became the 
first LSU player since Billy Cannon to win the 
Heisman, shattering previous voting records 
and receiving the highest percentage of first 
place votes. Breaking national and SEC 
records, Joe passed for 4,715 yards and 48 
touchdowns during the regular season, com-
pleting a college football record 77.9 percent 
of his passes. Joe’s historic season led LSU 
to its first SEC Championship since 2011 and 
a berth in the College Football Playoff. 
Originally from Athens, Ohio, Joe Burrow 
was given the opportunity to play football at 
LSU by head coach Ed Orgeron. Seizing this 
opportunity, Joe transformed the LSU offense 
and overall attitude of the team. His leadership 
on and off the field has made Louisiana proud, 
and we are forever grateful for his time at 
LSU. On behalf of Tiger fans in Louisiana and 
across the nation, and as a proud LSU alum-
nus, I again congratulate Joe on winning the 
Heisman Trophy, and officially recognize him 
as an adopted Louisianan. Geaux Tigers. 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK—DR. MIKE 
WELLS 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Dr. Mike Wells, Superintendent 
for the Hamburg Community School District for 
his effort to create a unique and engaging 
learning environment for K–8 students in the 
Hamburg Makerspace Program. 
The Makerspace Program and Farm School 
serving elementary and middle school stu-
dents in Hamburg, IA has been a major hit 
with both students and community members. 
Students have the opportunity to experience 
immersive learning environments where they 
gain hands on experience in a number of 
areas including: embroidery, wood working, 
culinary arts, screen printing, video game de-
sign with virtual reality, book making and so 
many other amazing programs each Friday for 
nine weeks. 
I had the opportunity to see these students 
at work, building a house for a family in their 
community that was hit by devastating flooding 
in the Spring of 2019. The plan is for a new 
home to be built each year moving forward 
and sold to a local family at a below market 
rate. Dr. Wells brings an amazing learning op-
portunity for his students and is using it to lift 
up our community. 
Dr. Wells has created an expectation in 
Hamburg Community Schools where students 
lead projects and obtain valuable, hands on 
experience. This includes The Farm School, 
started up in 2016, which is an effort to intro-
duce hands on, agricultural education experi-
ences through a functioning small farm on 
school property. This endeavor includes a gar-
den, green house, poultry, and livestock. The 
students supply the local food pantry fresh 
produce and eggs year-round. Dr. Wells has 
made the school the center of the community 
and is a source of pride and learning for all 
residents of Hamburg, IA. 
It is an honor to commemorate the out-
standing achievement of Dr. Wells and his 
staff in the Hamburg Community School Dis-
trict. I have great respect and admiration for 
our educators and am particularly thankful for 
the strong foundation they are giving our kids. 
As the mother of two boys, I know that a qual-
ity education is crucial to success. I hope the 
well-rounded training and techniques they 
found successful in the classroom becomes a 
model for other districts and the country as a 
whole.

Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Ivery Dwight 
Clifton of Winterville, Georgia, who passed 
away on January 1, 2020. 
Dr. Clifton was born on April 6, 1943, in Oli-

in his blood. His parents, once sharecroppers, 
eventually became landowners and young 
Ivery passionately loved their South Georgia 
homestead. This reverence for the land and 
his parents’ hard work inspired Dr. Clifton’s 
dedication 
to 
agricultural-based 
research, 
teaching and administration. 
Dr. Clifton graduated from William James 
High School in 1961. Although his father relied 
on him to work the farm, his mother encour-
aged and supported his pursuit of higher edu-
cation. He enrolled in Tuskegee Institute (Uni-
versity), receiving a B.S. in Agricultural Edu-
cation in 1965 and an M.S. in Agricultural Eco-
nomics in 1967. While at Tuskegee, he was 
active in the R.O.T.C., the yearbook staff, the 
military honor society (Scabbard and Blade) 
and worked as a dorm counselor to support 
his education. He met the love of his life, Pa-
tricia Ann Davis, during college. They wed on 
May 28, 1967, at the Tuskegee Chapel, a 
beautiful start to their 52-year marriage. 
Ivery and Pat’s blissful beginnings were 
abruptly interrupted when he answered the 
call to serve his country in the Army as a Lieu-
tenant during the Vietnam War. Leaving his 
first job as an agricultural economist with the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, he served as an 
advisor to the South Vietnamese Army, super-
vised tactical logistics and served as a Quar-
termaster. The intensity of his battle experi-
ences forever shaped his commitment to civic 
duty. 
After his service in Vietnam, he was em-
ployed by the United States Department of 
Agriculture in Washington, D.C. There, he and 
his wife welcomed their first-born daughter, 
Kalisa Nicole. Subsequently, the family moved 
to Champaign, Illinois, where he earned a 
Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics in 1976 from 
the University of Illinois. 
Dr. Clifton returned to Georgia, accepting an 
appointment as an Assistant Professor of Nat-
ural Resource Economics at the University of 
Georgia in Athens in 1976. He advanced 
through department, college, and university 
level positions. Notably, Dr. Clifton was the 
University of Georgia’s first African American 
Dean. He led the College of Agricultural and 
Environmental Services and his unique leader-
ship skills resulted in an assignment to the 
Presidential Office as Associate Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs. As his career pro-
gressed, the Cliftons were blessed with a sec-
ond daughter, Kelli Rochelle. 
An advocate for diversity, Dr. Clifton served 
as graduate advisor to students from across 
the globe. He also championed the Young 
Scholars Program to develop a pipeline of mi-
nority students interested in the field of agri-
culture. Students described Dr. Clifton as a 
superb teacher. They noted his systematic use 
of hands-on experiments, along with excellent 
lectures and handouts to make the learning of 
difficult topics easy through his caring person-
ality, effective communication skills and will-
ingness to help individual students succeed 
whenever necessary. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Clifton made sig-
nificant contributions to the profession of agri-
cultural economics, especially farm production 
and natural resource economics. Published 
extensively, his innovative expertise in eco-
nomic modeling has benefited research lit-
erature and the scientific community around 
the world. His major contributions have ad-
vanced state-of-the-art knowledge in under-
standing the policy implications of controlling 
non-point pollution and pricing of farm real es-
tate. His work in developing hedonic pricing 
functions for farmland has been used to en-
hance understanding of the operation of real 
estate markets in the United States, Australia, 
and Ireland. 
Dr. Clifton retired as a Lieutenant Colonel 
from the U.S. Army Reserves after 27 years of 
service. After nearly 30 years at the University 
of Georgia, Dr. Clifton retired in 2003, as Pro-
fessor Emeritus from the College of Agricul-
tural and Environmental Sciences. 
Dr. Clifton was also a dedicated community 
servant leader. As a 43-year member of the 
First A.M.E. Church, he served on the Board 
of Trustees, taught bible study and led the 
Men’s Fellowship. He was a member of Alpha 
Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated and was a 
Charter Member of the Delta Psi Chapter of 
Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated (The 
Boule’). He was inducted into Leadership 
Georgia and Gridiron. His service with organi-
zations such as Rotary, The Trust for Public 
Land, and countless local civic roles cemented 
friendships that he cherished. Recently, he 
‘‘unretired,’’ sat for an exam and was ap-
pointed as a tax assessor by the Mayor and 
Commission of Athens-Clarke County Govern-
ment. In 2016, The University of Illinois pre-
sented Dr. Clifton with the Alumni Award of 
Merit, given annually to graduates who have 
made significant contributions to their chosen 
profession. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Clifton’s life was de-
fined by his service to his family, to our coun-
try, and to our community. He will be forever 
remembered as a husband, a father, a grand-
father, a veteran, an educator, an adminis-
trator, a selfless servant, and a great friend. 
My wife, Alfredia, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the Clifton family. 
We also lift up the family and friends of Ivery 
Clifton in our prayers.

OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lucinda (Cindy) Avram, 
who recently passed away. She was a great 
Coloradan, wife, mother and grandmother. 
Cindy was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and at-
tended the University of Colorado, Boulder 
where she received a Bachelor of Science in 
1969. She was a proud resident of Colorado

she had a passion for politics and was very 
active in her party. Cindy loved her family 
dearly, she often spoke of them fondly to ev-
eryone she met. 
I got to know Cindy through politics over the 
years. We spent countless hours working to-
gether for our shared values. It was because 
of her hard work and dedication she was 
awarded the 2010 Volunteer Democrat of the 
Year Award from the Colorado Democratic 
Party. 
Cindy’s vibrance and good work in our com-
munity will never be forgotten. Her passion, 
good nature and sense of humor was a true 
delight. On behalf of the people of the 7th 
Congressional District, I honor Lucinda (Cindy) 
Avram for a life well-lived and extend my 
deepest appreciation for her contribution to

WHITEHAVEN 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
MATH TEACHER 
NATHAN KIRSCH 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Whitehaven High School math 
teacher Nathan Kirsch for winning the Milken 
Educator Award and its $25,000 honorarium. 
Mr. Kirsch was surprised with the award at 
a school assembly Wednesday morning where 
the entire student body applauded him for 
being the only teacher in Tennessee to re-
ceive the national distinction which some have 
called ‘‘the Oscar Award for teaching.’’ In ac-
cepting the award, Mr. Kirsch called it one ‘‘for 
all of my students,’’ past, current and future. 
The Whitehaven High School community is 
rightly proud of this accomplishment. 
It is very encouraging that a program known 
as a powerhouse in athletics is also being rec-
ognized for its excellence in academics. Mr. 
Kirsch embodies both traditions as the coach 
of the school’s cross-country and track teams 
and for being credited for raising the school’s 
AP Calculus scores. 
I also commend Whitehaven High School 
Principal Vincent Hunter for recognizing the 
importance of providing excellent educational 
opportunities across the board. The Milken 
Award is given to 40 early- and mid-career 
teachers across the country, often jump-start-
ing careers while inspiring educators and their 
communities. 
I congratulate Mr. Kirsch and all the 
Whitehaven 
Tigers 
on 
this 
exceptional 
achievement.

HONORING MR. ALEX RICHARDSON 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Alex Richardson who re-
cently graduated from college with a degree in 
Criminal Justice. Immediately following grad-
uation, Alex was hired by the City of Sunrise 
Police Department and sent to the police 
academy. On December 9, 2019, he was 
pinned in a ceremony at the Sunrise police 
headquarters and is currently undergoing po-
lice training in his community. 
Alex is known for beating the odds. He grew 
up without a father and lost his mother to can-
cer at age four. One of five children, he and 
his siblings were adopted by Mr. Patrick 
Hosler, Jr., who mentored him throughout his 
childhood. Alex played YFL football for his 
city, and he now coaches other young men 
and women in four sports. I am delighted that 
this fine young man lives in my Congressional 
district. I am confident that he will succeed be-
yond all expectations at whatever endeavor he 
chooses to pursue. I wish him all the very best 
and thank him for his service to our commu-
nity. 
RECOGNIZING JULIUS (‘‘JULIE’’) P. 
KNAPP 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, as we con-
sider this critical 5G security and supply chain 
legislation before us, on behalf of Ranking 
Member WALDEN, Subcommittee on Commu-
nications and Technology Chairman DOYLE, 
and Subcommittee Ranking Member LATTA, I 
would like to commend Julius (‘‘Julie’’) P. 
Knapp for the wonderful contributions to civil 
service he has made over his 45 year career. 
Mr. Knapp recently retired from his position 
as the Federal Communications Commission’s 
(FCC) Chief of the Office of Engineering and 
Technology. He is well known in our Com-
mittee because he has testified before us so 
many times over the years. We could always 
rely on his technically precise and straight-for-
ward testimony. Mr. Knapp is an internation-
ally-recognized expert who is known for his 
pragmatic and fair approach, and his ability to 
explain, in plain language, engineering issues 
to policymakers on all sides of an issue. 
Julie Knapp’s career ran in tandem with the 
growth of the American communications in-
dustry. In many ways, it was a symbiotic rela-
tionship. He graduated from high school in 
New Hyde, New York, in 1969, and received 
his engineering degree from the City College 
of New York in 1974. Less than a month later, 
he joined the FCC. At 22 years old, he started 
out certifying radio frequency devices. He then 
rose through the ranks to become Chief of the 
FCC laboratory, then Chief of the Policy and 
Rules Division for the Office and Engineering 
and Technology (OET), and finally Chief of 
OET, where he has served with extraordinary 
distinction since 2006. 
It goes without saying that Julie Knapp 
could have taken the extraordinary skills he 
perfected at the FCC to Silicon Valley or to 
one of the trade associations where his work 
is so well regarded and appreciated. Instead, 
he chose to serve the United States through 
multiple administrations as a public servant, 
and his longtime contributions will make a 
positive difference for generations to come. 
It’s not surprising that Mr. Knapp’s out-
standing work has brought him numerous 
awards and accolades within the government 
and in the engineering community. In 2012, he 
received one of the highest honors for a civil 
servant, the Presidential Distinguished Rank 
Award. He also received the FCC’s Gold and 
Silver awards and the Eugene C. Bowler 
award for exceptional professionalism and 
dedication to public service. 
Here in Congress, we have been the fortu-
nate beneficiaries of that dedication to public 
service. He has briefed generations of Mem-
bers and congressional staffers on the intrica-
cies of how spectrum works and why we need 
to harness it with careful consideration. He 
has provided significant and substantial input 
on all of the spectrum legislation passed by 
Congress in recent memory. 
Mr. Knapp helped usher in the modern age 
of communications. He played an instrumental 
role in helping us make spectrum available to 
fuel our nation’s economic and innovative 
growth. If you are accessing a mobile device 
right now, using WiFi or buying the latest wire-
less gadget, you are likely benefiting from 
Julie Knapp’s work. 
Julie Knapp epitomizes the non-partisan 
ideal of a public servant. As the leaders of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee, we 
are grateful for his invaluable longtime service 
to our nation, and extend our sincerest thanks 
to him for dedicating his life to building Amer-
ica’s communications systems.

RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE AND 
CAREER OF JIM WEILL 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jim Weill, a dedicated advo-
cate who has spent his 50-year career stand-
ing up for what’s right, and fighting to end pov-
erty and promote social justice in this country. 
As President of the Food Research & Action 
Center, also known as FRAC, Jim spent the 
last 22 years as a vital partner in the fight to 
eliminate hunger—my long-time priority here in 
Congress. 
During this time, he has worked hard to ex-
pand programs that are essential to reducing 
hunger for so many, including SNAP, school 
lunch and breakfast, after school and summer 
food programs, child care food, and WIC. He’s 
also been a champion of poverty reduction 
measures like the refundable Child Tax Credit. 
Madam Speaker, Jim’s commitment to end-
ing the epidemic of hunger in this country can-
not be understated, and is exemplified by his 
tireless efforts to strengthen the coalition to 
end it. He not only helped bolster FRAC’s net-
work of state and local partners, but he’s also 
launched and nurtured strong new anti-hunger 
advocacy groups, including in Maryland and 
the District of Columbia—bringing more allies 
into this important fight. 
His lifetime of advocacy has led him to other 
prominent roles as well. Early in his career, 
Jim served as counsel at the Legal Assistance 
Foundation of Chicago as the Director of Fed-
eral Litigation and Social Impact Projects, 
where he worked on over 100 federal class 
action and impact cases. This important work 
helped protect people on Social Security, 
Medicaid, AFDC, Food Stamps, and other 
public benefits. He also worked to improve our 
immigration system and combat discrimination 
against racial minorities and women.

January 9, 2020 
As if all that weren’t enough, Jim spent 16 
years as Program Director and General Coun-
sel at the Children’s Defense Fund, where he 
helped safeguard and expand essential pro-
grams promoting youth health and well-being. 
Jim played a leading role in the fight to ex-
pand Medicaid and made major contributions 
to the enactment of several programs to pro-
mote youth health like the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program. His leadership on chil-
dren’s rights helped spur child support en-
forcement reforms as well as the expansion of 
federal fair housing laws to include families 
with children. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people in whose 
lives Jim has made a positive difference, it is 
my great privilege and honor to thank and rec-

HONORING THE SIOUX FALLS VET-
ERANS 
AFFAIRS 
(VA) 
HEALTH 
CARE SYSTEM 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
the Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs (VA) Health 
Care System for achieving a Pathway Des-
ignation 
from 
the 
American 
Nurses 
Credentialing Center. 
The Pathway Designation is a global cre-
dential awarded to health care organizations 
that demonstrate an outstanding commitment 
to a healthy work environment that empowers 
and engages nurses. Investing in a positive, 
state-of-the-art workplace for nurses can lead 
to a greater culture of excellence for the entire 
health care facility. This has been clearly dem-
onstrated and recognized in Sioux Falls. 
Therefore, this designation is a win not only 
for the Sioux Falls VA, but also for the greater 
veteran community they serve. 
This award is a significant honor for the 
Sioux Falls VA Health Care System, validating 
their commitment to sustained excellence, pro-
fessionalism, and dedication from the nursing 
staff and their patients. I commend the nurses 
of this organization for their outstanding record 
of service, care, and hard work. I extend my 
deepest congratulations to the Sioux Falls Vet-
erans Affairs Health Care System for this des-
ignation.

HONORING MAYOR JOE WELLMAN 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Mayor Joe 
Wellman upon his retirement. In 1983, Mayor 
Wellman began his career at People’s Na-
tional Bank in Washington, Indiana. He later 
became the CEO at Peoples National Bank 
and served on the bank’s board of directors. 
Once Peoples National Bank merged with 
German American Bank, Joe continued his 
work there before retiring in 2008. After his re-
tirement, Joe spent time as a consultant and 
served one year with the Federal Deposit In-
surance Corporation before being elected as 
Mayor of Washington in 2011. 
Mayor Wellman has been affiliated with 
many community development organizations, 
including the Daviess County Community 
Foundation, Daviess County Economic Devel-
opment Corporation, Community Foundation 
Alliance, Accelerating Indiana Municipalities, 
Indiana Bankers Association, Radius Indiana, 
and Rotary, among many others. 
It has been a pleasure to work with Mayor 
Wellman while he led Washington through the 
development of I–69 and many other projects 
that have increased economic development in 
the community. I wish Mayor Wellman and his 
wife, Elaine, the best in retirement as they get 
to spend more time with their three daugh-
ters—Brenda, Angie and Lindsay—and their 7 
grandchildren.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF MRS. 
DORCAS R. HARDY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the service of Mrs. Dor-
cas R. Hardy who passed away Thursday, No-
vember 28, 2019. She selflessly served her 
community through her dedicated work in 
health services and passionately advocated 
the need for more financial security education 
for the public. Moreover, she served her coun-
try as the first woman commissioner of the So-
cial Security Administration in 1986. Her life 
was an example of dedication, toughness, 
love, and service from which all of us would 
be wise to learn. 
Dorcas was born in Newark, New Jersey on 
July 18, 1946. In 1968, she completed her 
bachelor’s degree at Connecticut College and 
subsequently obtained her Master of Business 
Administration 
degree 
in 
1976 
from 
Pepperdine University. As a natural-born lead-
er, she headed the Health Services Industry 
Committee, Cost of Living Council from 1971 
to 1973 and eventually was appointed to com-
missioner of the Social Security Administration 
in 1986 by then-president Ronald Reagan. 
Later, she continued to help the community by 
running a consulting firm and becoming a pas-
sionate advocate. 
In 1996, she married Dr. Samuel Spagnolo 
and is survived by him and her three step-
sons, along with their four grandchildren. Dor-
cas was a model for all of us not only in her 
work, but in her personal life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Mrs. Hardy and in thanking Dorcas 
Hardy’s family for their incredible sacrifices, 
devotion, and service to our nation; words 
cannot express our gratitude. On behalf of 
America’s First District, we say thank you. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF KENNETH 
KAZUTO TAKEUCHI 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of Mr. Ken Takeuchi, 
who passed away on December 8, 2019. Ken 
was the beloved voice of the Central Valley’s 
auto racing circuit for over 60 years. 
Kenneth Kazuto Takeuchi was born on Jan-
uary 27, 1927 in Fresno, California. During 
World War II, Ken and his family were ordered 
into internment camps in Jerome, Arkansas. 
Shortly after, Ken and his five brothers were 
drafted into the military and served their coun-
try during the war. Eventually, the family re-
turned to Fresno and their farm. After his mili-
tary service, Ken worked for the Fresno Coun-
ty Parks Department, before taking a different 
course in life. 
Ken was best known as a speedway an-
nouncer and organizer of races throughout the 
Central Valley. He got his start in the 1950s at 
the Selma Speedway. His voice graced auto 
races throughout the state for more than 60 
years. Ken was so well known, he was in-
ducted into numerous halls of fame, including 
in 1995 the San Jose’s Speedway Hall of 
Fame, the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame 
in 2017, and the Clovis Hall of Fame in 2019. 
Ken was also a competitive runner. His pas-
sion for running flourished in different ave-
nues. He was the founder of the Valley Run-
ner of the Year series and the Pro Race 
Group in Fresno. His goal was always for peo-
ple to come together through running and 
walking for good causes. In the 1980s, he 
began directing races. Ken also helped found 
the 
Shinzen 
Run, 
which 
supported 
the 
Shinzen Japanese Friendship Garden in Fres-
no, a cause that was deeply important to Ken 
and the community. In his later years, he 
worked with Special Olympics and appreciated 
his friendships with athletes of all ages. 
He is survived by his daughter, Cindy 
Campbell and her husband Duane; brother 
Leo Takeuchi; sister Erma Aoki; three grand-
children, Lindsay, Chelsea, and Ashley Camp-
bell, 
and 
his 
great 
grandchild, 
Melody 
Haussmann. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Ken Takeuchi. 
His commitment and dedication to the Central 
Valley sporting community left an impact on 
many. We join his family and friends in hon-
oring his great life.

CONGRATULATING DAISY PAEZ ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Daisy Paez on the occa-
sion of her retirement from the Educational Al-
liance after 30 years of dedication and service. 
The Educational Alliance is a non-profit orga-
nization established in 1889 serving thousands 
of Lower East Side residents and New York-
ers. 
A life-long resident of the Lower East Side, 
Daisy’s first interaction with the Educational 
Alliance (EA) was more than three decades 
ago when she enrolled her children in the 
early childhood program. Recognizing that a 
parent is a child’s primary teacher, Daisy 
bravely registered for adult classes. She was 
encouraged to push herself beyond her cir-
cumstances to achieve greater opportunities 
for herself and her children. With the support 
of the Educational Alliance, Daisy proudly 
earned her high school diploma. This achieve-
ment empowered her to apply for an employ-
ment opportunity at the Education Alliance 
which hired her. She then furthered her edu-
cation by taking college classes. These ac-
complishments emboldened her desire for 
community service and the betterment of her 
neighborhood. The Education Alliance pro-
vided an opportunity to develop her skills, 
leadership and helped her build a pathway for 
economic security for the past 30 years. 
Daisy is an amazing role model for women 
and single parents. She is a strong and effec-
tive community advocate. In her capacity on 
numerous local boards, she has championed 
issues from demanding enhanced transpor-
tation services for seniors, to fighting for in-
crease funding for youth programs and more 
access to park space. 
Today, Daisy is an elected community rep-
resentative, currently serving as District Lead-
er for NYS’s 65th Assembly District, Part B. 
She is also a member of the 7th Precinct 
Community Council and a graduate of the 
NYC Police Department’s Citizens Police 
Academy and the FBI’s Citizens’ Academy. 
She works closely with government leaders on 
behalf of her constituents. 
Daisy’s commitment and dedication to her 
community is immeasurable. She has made a 
remarkable impression at work and in the 
community through her public service. I know 
her colleagues and members of the Edu-
cational Alliance will deeply miss her guid-
ance, smile and energy. 
I congratulate Daisy Paez on her retirement 
and wish her the very best to her and her fam-
ily as she enters the next phase of her life.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, as the mother of an air force veteran, my 
heart goes out to every military family right 
now living on pins and needles over what 
President Trump set in motion. We still don’t 
know what threat was so dire that President 
Trump needed to risk a conflict with Iran to kill 
their second-most powerful leader. What we 
do know is American lives are our nation’s 
most precious treasure, and this president 
cannot be trusted to keep us safe. I was un-
avoidably detained during the vote and regret 
that I was not able to cast my vote tonight, but 
I wholeheartedly support the War Powers Act 
(H. Con. Res. 83) and would have voted in 
favor of it as reflected in my YEA vote and 
testimony in the Rules Committee the day 
prior. 
Had I been present, I would have voted: 
YEA on Roll Call No. 7.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHESTER 
B. PIATKOWSKI 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Chester B. Piatkowski, who 
passed away on December 27, 2019, at the 
age of 96. A veteran and devoted public serv-
ant, Chester Piatkowski will be dearly missed 
by his family and community. 
After graduating from Vocational School in 
Verona, NY, Chester Piatkowski enlisted in the 
United States Navy, proudly serving his coun-
try in World War II. During the war, he was 
stationed in England, working as an Aviation 
Petty Officer 2nd Class, repairing PBY planes. 
After the war, Chester Piatkowski served as a 
Police Officer with the City of Syracuse, even-
tually rising to the rank of Sergeant. A pro-
ficient marksman, Chester Piatkowski oversaw 
firearms training for the Syracuse Police De-
partment, and competed in police pistol com-
petitions across New York State, winning sev-
eral first-place trophies. 
Throughout Chester Piatkowski’s life, he re-
mained very proud of his American and Polish 
heritage. He was active in the Polish American 
Legion Post 14, Seniors at the Syracuse Pol-
ish Home, and enjoyed taking Polish language 
classes. Additionally, he was a member of the 
American Legion Post 113, the Police Retirees 
Association, and the Holy Name society at the 
Basilica of the Sacred Heart. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring the life of 
Chester B. Piatkowski. A veteran and devoted 
public servant, Chester Piatkowski’s legacy 
will always be remembered and cherished. I 
encourage my colleagues to keep his family in 
their prayers during this truly difficult time.

THE U.S.-INDIA ALLIANCE 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the strong relationship between the 
United States and India. Since our two coun-
tries established diplomatic relations in 1946 
through the 2005 launch of our strategic part-
nership, the United States and India have had 
a long and storied history. I thank Ambassador 
Shringla for his friendship and his deep com-
mitment to maintaining our strong US-India al-
liance. I wish him the best of luck in his future 
endeavors. 
I stand with India in their aspiration to pro-
vide equal economic, social, and political op-
portunities to all citizens. As part of this pur-
suit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted 
last year to change the status of Jammu and 
Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of 
India to address the stagnant economy and 
high youth unemployment plaguing the region 
by providing economic opportunity and sound 
governance. The residents of Jammu and 
Kashmir have battled economic depression 
and forces of extremism and radicalization for 
too long. The regional stability now provided 
by government will give residents of Jammu 
and Kashmir a better way forward and hope 
for the future.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BLACK JANUARY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 9, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of the 30th anniversary of the 
events in Azerbaijan culminating in what is 
now known as Black January. In January 
1990, the former U.S.S.R. attempted to con-
tinue to suppress freedom and impose its po-
litical will on the people of Azerbaijan. At that 
time, however, the people of Azerbaijan de-
cided that they had enough of Soviet control 
and resisted. 
At night, the Red Army marched into Baku 
to stem the movements for equality and free-
dom. While the Azeris used peaceful protests 
and calls for freedom, the Soviets responded 
with guns and tanks. These actions resulted in 
147 civilian deaths, with hundreds more 
wounded and imprisoned. 
The Azeris had seen what happened to 
prior independence movements in the Soviet 
Union, yet they persevered on. This tragedy 
only emboldened them in their cause, carrying 
on the mission of their countrymen which cul-
minated in their August 1991 independence. 
Since this monumental declaration, Azer-
baijan has been a beacon of freedom in the 
region as well as a friend and ally of the 
United States. At this time, we memorialize 
those fallen and celebrate the continued 
strength of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to recognize Black January and join in 
the honoring of allies in Azerbaijan and their 
quest for liberation.
