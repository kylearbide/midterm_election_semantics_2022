THANKING DAVID, JOSHUA, AND 
DANIEL SHIMKUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
again, this time to thank my boys, now 
young men, for their love, support, and 
understanding during my time as a 
Member of Congress. 
As I stated yesterday, when I was 
sworn in for my first term in January 
1997, David was 3 years old, Joshua was 
1 year old. In 1999, Daniel was born. 
After completing this term, I will 
have served 24 years. My sons will be 
28, 25, and 21, respectively. So their en-
tire lives have been having their dad as 
a Member of Congress. 
I always joked that, in the early 
days, the boys were packageable. In the 
district, we just packed them up and 
hauled them around. Yes, this meant 
diapers, 
changes 
of 
clothes, 
Lunchables. Well, you get the idea. 
Yet they had a chance to visit county 
and State fairs. They also had to sit 
through more than their fair share of 
political dinners, and, oh, the parades 
in every season and in every weather 
condition. Fruities and Tootsie Rolls 
were our chosen candy. A child can 
only eat so many. 
As they grew, they started to be in-
volved in other activities. I tried to be 
as supportive as possible. Whether it 
was recreational soccer, singing in the 
St. Louis Children’s Choirs, Suzuki vio-
lin lessons, or activities at church and 
school, I tried to pick up the slack 
where and when I could. 
I am still burdened by the events 
missed. One particular troubling time 
was missing an entire baseball season. 
David’s games were on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, and in that year, we were 
either traveling to D.C., in D.C., or re-
turning home. Because of a fluke in the 
schedule, I had a chance to make a 
game, so I hopped on a plane, just to 
find out that, while I was landing, it 
was raining. 
I did help coach Joshua’s soccer team 
1 or 2 years. Sometimes I was that good 
example and sometimes I was not. 
I cheered loudly and supportably for 
Daniel. Sometimes I was that good ex-
ample in the stands and sometimes 
not. I think my problem was trying to 
make up for missed time, becoming too 
engaged in their competitions. 
Having one type A parent is chal-
lenging, but having two can be over-
whelming. You have to ask my sons 
how they perceived their father. To me, 
they continued to be supportive and 
knew that I was making every effort to 
share in their life activities. This is 
something that I try to do even today, 
much to their chagrin. 
David now works for a major utility 
as a computer programmer. Joshua is 
here on the Hill after a stint in the 
Peace Corps. Daniel is attending a 
major university closer to home. We 
check in frequently and continue to 
have each other’s backs. 
The boys, now young men, continue 
to be close and also check in with each 
other. They probably spend much of 
their time talking about their parents. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to publicly 
thank them for their support over the 
years. I want to apologize for the times 
that I placed work over family and ask 
their forgiveness. 
I am very proud of them. 
f 
PEACEFUL PROTEST IS THE BEST 
PROTEST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. 
I rise here in the House of Represent-
atives because many persons made 
great sacrifices so that I would have 
this opportunity to stand and speak 
today. 
Many of these persons were the per-
sons who protested. They faced Bull 
Connor’s dogs and Jim Crow’s laws. 
They know what a billy club hurts 
like. They know what losing a loved 
one to a cause feels like. These were 
the protestors that made it possible. 
I can only imagine what would have 
happened had the Honorable John 
Lewis, Hosea Williams, and Jimmy Lee 
Jackson, those persons who protested— 
Jimmy Lee Jackson lost his life; Rev-
erend C. T. Vivian was there on the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge—if they had as-
saulted the police, if they had con-
fronted the police and met them with 
force, would I be standing here today? 
I think not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3592 
July 21, 2020 
I believe that peaceful protest has 
made it possible for a good many Mem-
bers of Congress to be here. Not all of 
us are here because we are so smart. A 
good many of us are here because oth-
ers made great sacrifice so that we 
would have these opportunities. 
This is why I stand here today to say 
that we can peacefully protest; we can 
be disruptive without being destruc-
tive. 
If you are being destructive, you are 
not helping the cause. 
Peaceful protest is the best protest. 
It is what has made a difference for so 
many of us in so many ways: We have 
integrated facilities because of peace-
ful protest; labor laws have been 
changed because of peaceful protest; 
persons have the right to vote because 
of peaceful protest. 
Peaceful protest is the best protest, 
and it has made a difference in the 
lives of a good many people in this 
country. 
So I absolutely salute those who 
peacefully protest, and I do not con-
done those who protest otherwise. 
Now, with reference to the constabu-
lary, there have been unidentified per-
sons, Federal agents, who have been 
policing the streets of American cities. 
They do not have the right to pick peo-
ple up indiscriminately. They do not 
have the right to take people away and 
hold them and then drop them off at 
some location. They are not within the 
law when they do this, and officers of 
the law should not break the law. 
These are unidentified Federal agents, 
and they must be stopped. This is not 
the American way. 
I support the law as it relates to the 
protestors; I support the law as it re-
lates to the Federal agents. All should 
obey the law. 
Now, you say to me: ‘‘Well, how is it 
that you went to jail?’’ Well, I went to 
jail, and I was willing to suffer the con-
sequences. I was protesting. I was in 
the middle of the street, as a matter of 
fact, here in Washington, D.C., when I 
went to jail once. I was there, and I 
suffered my consequences. 
Dr. King wrote his ‘‘Letter from Bir-
mingham Jail’’ from the Birmingham 
Jail. 
It is disruptive action, not destruc-
tive action. This was a disruption that 
we created in the streets. It was a dis-
ruption that caused Dr. King to go to 
jail. It was not destruction. 
If you destroy things, you are not 
within the law. Do not break the law in 
the sense that you are going to destroy 
things. Destruction is not the way to 
protest. Disruption is how we get it 
done. 
And with reference to the constabu-
lary: follow the law. We cannot have 
law enforcement officers breaking the 
law under the guise of trying to protect 
statues and other things from destruc-
tion. Neither of these two groups can 
bring about the kind of justice that we 
are looking for. 
We are protesting now because of the 
brutality that many people have suf-
fered, and some have lost their lives at 
the hands of the constabulary. 
But we are also protesting because 
we are being discriminated as it relates 
to lending. When people don’t get the 
loans that they qualify for, their liveli-
hoods are being stolen from them, their 
opportunities are being stolen from 
them. So we are protesting discrimina-
tion in lending. 
We are protesting discrimination in 
hiring and promotions. There is this 
notion that we should have kitchen 
table issues discussed. Well, discrimi-
nation in hiring is a kitchen table 
issue. Those who believe that jobs 
without discrimination as a conversa-
tion is not a kitchen table issue, you 
are wrong. People discuss these things, 
and we should. 
We have to make sure that every per-
son is treated equally under the law in 
the United States of America. 
Peaceful protest is the best protest. 
Law enforcement officers must follow 
the law. 
The protestation exceeds what is 
happening with the constabulary. It 
moves into the banks; it moves into 
our homes; it moves into our lives.

CONGRATULATING MILITARY 
ACADEMY GRADUATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
some great Americans. I am here to 
congratulate and thank a dozen brave 
men and women who have committed 
their lives to serving our country. 
Earlier this summer, 12 of my con-
stituents 
and 
former 
constituents 
whom I am proud to have nominated 
for an appointment to our Nation’s 
military academies have graduated. 
It has been an incredible honor to 
meet these dedicated young people 
over the years and to support them in 
their pursuit of an education. Those 
who choose to spend their lives pro-
tecting 
and 
defending 
the 
United 
States are the bravest this great Na-
tion has to offer. 
Today, I would like to recognize each 
of the graduates whom I have pre-
viously 
nominated 
who 
completed 
their education at our Nation’s mili-
tary academies: 
Robert Bendik of State College, a 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; 
Isaac Bengel of Erie, a graduate of 
the U.S. Naval Academy; 
Darren Keglovits of Coudersport, a 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; 
Hannah Milliron of Duke Center, a 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; 
Alexandra Treglia of State College, a 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; 
Grayson Hill of North East, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Military Academy 
West Point; 
Sarah Henderson of Indiana, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Military Academy 
West Point; 
Sterling Pickett of Loganton, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Air Force Academy; 
Bailey Ishler of State College, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Air Force Academy; 
Emily Walbridge of Mill Hall, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Air Force Academy; 
Karlee Xander of Corry, a graduate of 
the U.S. Air Force Academy; and 
Thomas King of Port Matilda, a grad-
uate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. 
These brave men and women have 
bright futures ahead of them, Mr. 
Speaker; and as they begin their ca-
reers in our Nation’s Armed Forces, I 
know their hard work, their dedica-
tion, and their commitment will serve 
them well. 
I am incredibly grateful for their 
service, and I commend them for their 
bravery. 
This next chapter in life will present 
many challenges, but also many oppor-
tunities, and I am confident that these 
young people will rise to the occasion. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
these individuals for their service, and 
I wish them the very best of luck.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DE-
CLARED WAR ON PORTLAND, OR-
EGON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
come to the floor today with a heavy 
heart. I see Donald Trump’s adminis-
tration declaring war on my hometown 
of Portland, Oregon. 
After failing the American people in 
the coronavirus, in the face of 6 
months of not just weak leadership, 
but virtually no leadership at all, there 
are tens of thousands of people dying 
unnecessarily. 
It is hard to focus on the unprece-
dented assault on our environmental 
protections that they have unleashed, 
but now they are declaring war on 
America’s cities, sending in an occu-
pying force drawn from Homeland Se-
curity, particularly the Customs and 
Border Protection patrol, ostensibly to 
protect monuments and statues. 
What about protecting the American 
people and their constitutional right to 
protest? 
Don’t attack our people with tear gas 
without warning, seriously injuring 
people exercising their right to protest, 
things that people can see on video 
with their own eyes; watching the gen-
tleman hit with a projectile, requiring 
serious surgery, inflicting facial inju-
ries; a person just asking what was 
going on having officers assault him, 
breaking his hand. 
They can’t be that inept. It must be 
purposeful, taking a very challenging 
situation in my hometown and making 
it worse. 
But make no mistake. This isn’t just 
about Portland, Oregon. 
We watched what they did in Lafay-
ette Park across from the White House, 
again assaulting innocent protestors in

order to have a photo op for the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
There are indications that they are 
moving to Chicago, Atlanta, Kansas 
City, Seattle. Who is going to be next? 
Talking about the challenges that 
have been taken in Philadelphia with a 
reforming 
district 
attorney, 
Larry 
Krasner, and somehow holding him up 
as an example of breakdown in law and 
order and an assault on the American 
public. It is just crazy. 
b 0915 
Portland, Oregon is not out of con-
trol. To be sure, there are some people 
who have strong feelings, and there are 
some who have done things that are in-
appropriate and unlawful. But that is 
the challenge of our local and State of-
ficials to manage it; not having some-
body unwelcome, uninvited, and unpre-
pared coming in to take this difficult 
situation and make it worse. 
I deeply appreciate the congressional 
leadership, chairmen of the Armed 
Services Committee, ADAM SMITH, the 
Judiciary Committee, JERRY NADLER, 
BENNIE THOMPSON, Homeland Security, 
who have decried this activity. 
It is important that we deal with 
Trump’s weaponizing law enforcement 
for his own agenda, not driven by peo-
ple’s needs, but by his poll numbers, 
and becoming an occupying force in 
our community and, sadly, I fear, else-
where. 
We need to move forward dealing 
with what they are doing. We want to 
pursue legislative initiatives, spending 
limitations, oversight hearings. This 
needs to be front and center. At a time 
when we have so much to deal with, 
people cannot ignore what is happening 
in Portland and what may be coming 
to their city. 
With the administration becoming 
more hysterical in their charges lead-
ing up to the election and falling poll 
numbers, there is no community that 
is safe from this interference. We must 
do all we can to not just spotlight but 
push back. 
Our democratic process and our con-
stitutional rights are literally at risk, 
and you can see it in terms of what has 
been happening in Portland, Oregon.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MS. E.B. HINES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Ms. E.B. Hines, who recently 
celebrated her 91st birthday. 
Ms. Hines was raised in the gem of 
northeast Florida in the town of 
Palatka, on the beautiful St. Johns 
River. She attended and graduated 
from Central Academy in May of 1946. 
She went on to become a prolific edu-
cator, dedicating 40 years of her life to 
the teaching profession. 
Over the past few decades, Ms. Hines 
has made the historic preservation of 
Central Academy her primary focus. 
Originally established in 1892, Central 
Academy became the first accredited 
African American high school in the 
State of Florida in 1924. Due to its his-
toric significance, Central Academy 
was added to the National Register of 
Historic Places by the National Park 
Service in 1998. 
Ms. Hines’ mission is to turn this site 
into a museum and community center. 
Her effort is supported by many in the 
Putnam County community, and I 
stand here today to tell Ms. Hines that 
I will do all that is in my power to en-
sure her dream becomes a reality. 
Ms. Hines, God bless you and the im-
portant work that you do. 
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA WINS THE GEORGE W. 
BUSH INSTITUTE OF INNOVATION AWARD 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the University of Flor-
ida and its outstanding faculty and 
staff on their receipt of the George W. 
Bush Institute of Innovation Award. A 
team of economists and business devel-
opment experts ranked the University 
of Florida number 1 nationally in inno-
vation impact, compared to all other 
universities in the Nation. 
By itself, the University of Florida 
was ranked sixth in the Nation when 
compared to the whole combined Cali-
fornia or Texas education systems. The 
University of Florida is the most pro-
ductive large university in the country 
at leveraging its research funding into 
new companies, new jobs, and new 
ideas. 
In the study conducted by the George 
W. Bush Institute and the Opus Faveo 
Innovation 
Development 
Consulting 
firm, the University of Florida proved 
it moves more technologies to the 
point of impact than anyone else in the 
country. The University has an average 
of 123 patents and generated 15 startups 
per year between 2013 and 2017. UF was 
an even stronger performer and license 
outcome, earning an average of $36 mil-
lion per year, equal to 6.4 percent of its 
research dollars. 
Additionally, the University of Flor-
ida also ranked fourth overall in teach-
ing impact and it produced one-third as 
many STEM Ph.D. graduates each year 
as the entire University of California 
system, despite having a research 
budget of only one-tenth as large. 
The University of Florida has created 
an entire innovation ecosystem, in-
cluding tech transfer, business incuba-
tors, a venture fund, corporate engage-
ment, and more to support the transi-
tional research generated by the Uni-
versity of Florida faculty. 
The George W. Bush Institute and 
Opus Faveo Innovation Development’s 
report highlights UF’s operation as one 
of 
the 
most 
respected 
technology 
transfer offices in the country with the 
best tech transfer team in the world. 
The University has spun off more 
than 60 companies in biotech alone. 
Major 
pharmaceuticals, 
food, 
agri-
culture, biotech, and the energy sec-
tors have acquired more than 20 per-
cent of these companies. 
The faculty, staff, and students at 
the University of Florida are as intel-
ligent as they are ambitious, and dem-
onstrate 
the 
breadth 
of 
diversity, 
thought, and creativity in the State of 
Florida. It is because of accomplish-
ments such as this that Florida is 
counted among the most successful and 
influential States in the Nation. 
I am proud, as I see the positive im-
pacts of the University of Florida’s 
continual research for knowledge, in-
novation, and discovery. The students 
and faculty at the University of Flor-
ida are determined, hardworking, and I 
am glad to see that the University is 
getting the recognition that it de-
serves. 
Congratulations again to my alma 
mater, the University, its faculty, and 
staff on this exceptional award and for 
your continued dedication to knowl-
edge and education. The University of 
Florida’s leadership is invaluable as it 
leads the way IN innovation for genera-
tions to come. 
As a double Gator, I am honored to 
be able to represent the University of 
Florida and the Gator Nation in Flor-
ida’s Third Congressional District, and 
I look forward to witnessing your con-
tinued success. 
Go Gators.

HONORING FALLEN HEROES OF 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise for several reasons; first and fore-
most, to honor the life and legacy of 
my friend and colleague, Congressman 
John Lewis. 
Long before he brought his talents to 
the halls of Congress, John was a 
young leader in the Civil Rights Move-
ment. Together with his SNCC and 
CORE brothers and sisters, they waged 
a war for the heart and soul of this Na-
tion and changed history. I feel truly 
honored to have served with him, and I 
will be forever changed. 
From the Edmund Pettus Bridge to 
the House floor, John is or was the con-
science of the Congress and truly of our 
Nation, and he will be missed. 
Likewise, we lost another civil rights 
leader, Reverend C.T. Vivian, a Free-
dom Rider who worked alongside Dr. 
King. Reverend Vivian was also a mem-
ber of the Atlanta community, and my 
heart is with that great city at this dif-
ficult time. 
CHALLENGING THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO 
DO THEIR JOB 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to challenge the Senate to 
do their job. 
The American people are suffering 
from the coronavirus pandemic. Hos-
pitals remain flooded, small businesses 
remain shuttered. Restaurants are try-
ing to get by on take-out only, and 
bills are piling up on the kitchen table. 
Yet, the Senate, controlled by the 
GOP, does nothing but confirm ques-
tionable judges. 
Have they had a debate on the House- 
passed HEROES Act? No.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3594 
July 21, 2020 
Have they discussed providing re-
sources to communities so they can 
pay the salaries of our brave first re-
sponders, our community heroes? No. 
Have they considered how out-of- 
work parents will pay their bills when 
the emergency unemployment insur-
ance expires? No. 
And that is because this Republican 
Party, most clearly, Donald Trump and 
MITCH MCCONNELL, do not care about 
the American people. They do not care 
about you, the bills that are piling up 
because you can’t work, or the kids 
who are going hungry every day. 
Time and time again, my colleagues 
on the other side of this aisle and 
across the building have shown nothing 
but disregard to the challenges of the 
American people, the same people they 
claim to serve. 
Look at the record. The GOP Senate 
has dragged its feet time and time 
again, while more than 100,000 Ameri-
cans died from coronavirus. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 2 
months since the people’s House passed 
our Nation’s fifth COVID–19 bill. We 
called it the HEROES Act in honor of 
all the men and women putting their 
lives and health on the line to protect 
and serve our families and our commu-
nities. 
The HEROES Act is focused on three 
things: Testing, testing, testing; and it 
ensures that testing, including contact 
tracing, is conducted in areas with the 
highest rates of infection. 
It also provides another round of di-
rect payments to American families to 
help 
them 
weather 
this 
economic 
storm. I can’t tell you how many fami-
lies told me that the first $1,200 was 
spent before it hit their bank accounts. 
We need to be frank about our cur-
rent economic situation. Our GOP col-
leagues shoved through their GOP tax 
scam in order to juice our economy. 
Right now, this is the only economic 
leverage available to Congress or the 
Fed. 
It is time to put money directly into 
the pockets of American families and 
business owners. They will spend it, 
and our economy will continue. But 
that’s 
basic 
math 
and 
economics, 
something often lost on the other side. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not hard to turn on 
FOX or MSNBC and hear the talking 
heads arguing this or that point. But I 
want to talk about the rest of America, 
places like Lansing and Bourbonnais. 
I am proud to represent more than 40 
cities and towns. It is no secret that 
State and local revenues have plum-
meted due to COVID–19. Yet, these dol-
lars pay for critical government serv-
ices like first responders, trash collec-
tion, teachers, and public health work-
ers; and COVID–19 has shown us how 
truly indispensable they are. 
The HEROES Act includes billions in 
Federal investments in our States, cit-
ies, and towns, the places we call home. 
Under the HEROES Act, Lansing, in 
my district, will receive more than $13 
million over the next 2 years; more 
than $18 million for Calumet City, and 
nearly a half a million dollars for 
Chebanse. Think about what those re-
sources can do for our communities. 
Every cent pays for our firefighters and 
teachers, health educators, and essen-
tial bus drivers. 
HEROES Act funds will ensure that 
our kids keep learning despite COVID– 
19. It provides $90 billion to ensure 
schools can cover the cost of the dig-
ital transition and that they will be 
safe and sanitary when students re-
turn. 
And 
finally, 
the 
HEROES 
Act 
prioritizes ensuring American families 
can eat by increasing the maximum 
SNAP benefit. 
After working to ensure the needs of 
Illinois families are addressed in the 
HEROES Act, I know this bill is about 
America’s heroes and our families. 
That is why it came from the people’s 
House. 
The HEROES Act is not about the 
President or any one party; it is about 
doing the right thing because Amer-
ican families are struggling. Small 
businesses are on the edge of closing, 
and our communities are struggling to 
pay our EMTs and firefighters, the 
very people we rely on during this pan-
demic. My mayors have told me they 
will have to start furloughing and lay-
ing people off. 
The Senate must act. The ball is in 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s court. Do the right 
thing. Do your job. 
By the way, Mr. President, if you want to 
help Chicago, the Nation needs safe gun re-
forms, investigations of illegal sales, more 
spending on community-based outreach and 
development. We don’t want Portland re-
peated in Chicago.

SUPPORTING NDAA AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which would 
deepen U.S. engagement in Southeast 
Asia by requiring the United States to 
develop a coherent regional strategy 
that addresses all aspects of the rela-
tionship, from trade and humanitarian 
goals to diplomatic and security ar-
rangements. 
Member states of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, 
are vital to the prosperity the U.S. 
economy, generating hundreds of thou-
sands of American jobs and investing 
more in our economy than China and 
India combined. ASEAN is the counter-
weight to Chinese aggression in the re-
gion and world. 
The People’s Republic of China is 
working aggressively to expand its in-
fluence in this strategically important 
region, using a combination of preda-
tory investment, threatening new mili-
tary installments, and outright bul-
lying to achieve its goals. 
b 0930 
Southeast Asian countries seek as-
surance that the United States is a 
steadfast partner as they try to main-
tain 
economic 
independence 
from 
China and defend their territorial 
claims in the South China Sea. We 
must support our partners and allies as 
they stand up to China’s erratic and 
aggressive behavior. 
I have had many opportunities to 
meet with ASEAN officials and foreign 
ministers, and one message I hear re-
peatedly is that the United States 
must demonstrate strength and leader-
ship in the region. Congress should lis-
ten closely to our partners who are de-
manding stronger leadership and not 
just because China, which would be 
sure to fill a vacuum of power, is a 
bully. ASEAN is clearly a powerhouse 
and a critical region in which to en-
gage in and of itself. 
The 
U.S. 
should 
be 
proactively 
crafting and implementing its South-
east Asia strategy; this amendment 
would require the administration to do 
just that. 
I thank Congressman CASTRO, with 
whom I co-chair and cofounded the 
ASEAN Caucus, for his support of 
ASEAN and this very amendment. I am 
gratified that my colleagues support 
and, in fact, passed my amendment. 
PREVENTING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of two amendments to 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act which will improve the United 
States’ ability to prevent human rights 
violations connected to the pandemic 
and improve its response to future pub-
lic health catastrophes. 
As countries around the world have 
struggled to contain the virus and pro-
tect their citizens, some bad actors are 
using coronavirus response efforts as a 
pretext to chip away at the rights of 
their citizens, stifle protests, and limit 
the freedom of speech and the press. We 
must hold accountable the authoritar-
ians who see COVID–19 as an oppor-
tunity to suppress dissent. 
I am pleased that my colleagues sup-
ported 
and 
passed 
Congressman 
MCGOVERN’s 
and 
my 
amendment, 
which will ensure the United States 
uses a robust tool kit, including report-
ing, foreign assistance, and guidance, 
to protect basic human rights during 
this time of uncertainty. I am proud to 
colead, in a bipartisan effort, this im-
portant amendment, and I am grateful 
for its adoption. 
I also thank my colleagues for their 
support and adoption of Congressman 
CONNOLLY’s and my amendment, which 
will greatly improve the United States’ 
ability to prevent and respond to glob-
al health threats like the coronavirus 
pandemic. This amendment will estab-
lish a Federal official tasked with co-
ordinating interagency responses to 
global health emergencies and requires 
the 
United 
States 
to 
proactively 
strategize for future crises. It also 
strengthens U.S. efforts to help our 
partners fight and contain outbreaks 
within their own borders. 
As we have seen during this tragedy, 
viruses can spread across borders and

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of Heaven and Earth, thank You 
for giving us another day. 
The Nation awakes to reports of ris-
ing coronavirus numbers, many in 
places once touted as being safe from 
the danger of spread. Have mercy on 
us. Help us to hear Your call to leave 
pride and boasting behind and together 
face a most dangerous threat to the 
health and well-being of our citizens. 
Bless the Members of this people’s 
House with Your spirit of cooperation 
and a desire to work together to ad-
dress our Nation’s most pressing needs. 
Continue to bless and protect those 
men and women who have been bur-
dened for so long with the care of the 
infected, even as they are asked to 
make more bricks with less straw. As 
hospitals fill, empower those given the 
responsibility to lead with wisdom and 
practical insights to rise to the de-
mands of their leadership. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 20, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Mr. Robert Brehm and Mr. 
Todd 
Valentine, 
Co-Executive 
Directors, 
New York State Board of Elections, indi-
cating that, according to the preliminary re-
sults of the Special Election held June 23, 
2020, the Honorable Chris Jacobs was elected 
Representative to Congress for the Twenty- 
Seventh Congressional District, State of New 
York. 
With best wishes, I am 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON. 
NEW YORK STATE 
BOARD OF ELECTIONS, 
Albany, NY, July 17, 2020. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, June 23, 2020, for 
Representative in Congress from the 27th 
Congressional District of New York, show 
that Chris Jacobs received 81,034 of the total 
number of votes cast for that office. 
Chris Jacobs—81,034; 
Nathan D. McMurray—72,887; 
Michael J. Gammariello—995; 
Duane Whitmer—1,419. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Chris Jacobs was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 27th Con-
gressional District of New York. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by all (Part of Erie, Genesee, 
Livingston, Part of Monroe, Part of Niagara, 
Part of Ontario, Orleans and Wyoming Coun-
ties) involved, an official Certificate of Elec-
tion will be prepared for transmittal as re-
quired by law.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
CHRIS JACOBS, OF NEW YORK, 
AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the gentleman 
from New York, the Honorable CHRIS 
JACOBS, be permitted to take the oath 
of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
New York? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will the Representa-
tive-elect and the members of the New 
York delegation present themselves in 
the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his 
right hand. 
Mr. JACOBS appeared at the bar of 
the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you 
will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that you will bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same; that you 
take this obligation freely, without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
and that you will well and faithfully dis-
charge the duties of the office on which you 
are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 116th Con-
gress.

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
CHRIS JACOBS TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, it is 
my honor, on behalf of the New York 
Congressional delegation, as the co- 
dean 
along 
with 
Chairman 
ELIOT 
ENGEL, to welcome our newest member, 
CHRIS JACOBS. Or perhaps I should say 
welcome him back, since Mr. JACOBS 
began his career just out of college 
working for New York Congressman 
Jack Kemp. 
After returning home to western New 
York, he has pursued various profes-
sional paths, including public service. 
He began an education charity and his 
own small business, Avalon Develop-
ment. 
Mr. JACOBS served as the Erie County 
Clerk and most recently was a member 
of the New York State Senate since 
2017. 
I congratulate Congressman JACOBS 
and look forward to working with him 
at this critical time to deliver for our 
home State of New York in the coming 
months. 
I also welcome his family here today, 
including his wife, Martina, and beau-
tiful young daughter, Anna. 
Madam Speaker, at this time I am 
pleased to yield to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KING). 
Mr. KING of New York. Madam 
Speaker, it is really a privilege to be 
here today to welcome CHRIS JACOBS to 
the House of Representatives. 
As Congresswoman LOWEY said, he 
has a long career both in government 
and being active in his community, es-
pecially setting up an inner city schol-
arship fund for the City of Buffalo, 
serving as Secretary of State for the 
State of New York, then being elected 
Erie County Clerk, and then being 
elected New York State senator. 
It is a very perilous time to be com-
ing to Congress. The country is going 
through extreme tension and conflict. 
The fact is, CHRIS has the credentials, 
he has the qualifications, and he has 
the ability to make sure that he will do

the best for his constituents, for the 
entire Congress, and also for the coun-
try. 
So with that, CHRIS, I am really 
proud to welcome you here today. 
And, again, sometimes you hear 
about all of the partisanship. Believe 
me, we in New York do try to work to-
gether. NITA and I, we don’t always 
agree on everything, but we always 
find a way to work together. This is 
true of most of the members of the del-
egation. I have no doubt that you will 
do an outstanding, excellent job. I look 
forward to working with you over the 
next several months. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield to our newest Member 
of Congress, Congressman CHRIS
JA-
COBS. 
Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, thank 
you very much and thank you for con-
ducting the ceremony today. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
LOWEY
and Representative KING
for 
those kind introductions. 
I also want to acknowledge the Mem-
bers of the entire New York State dele-
gation that are here today. I look for-
ward to working with all of you to help 
our State in a time that they are clear-
ly in need, in a fiscal crisis. 
I also want to acknowledge my fam-
ily members that are here today: My 
wife, Martina, and my daughter, Anna. 
Thank you for your love and support 
during this campaign. My mother, 
Pamela, and my two brothers, Larry 
and Luke, are also here. Thank you for 
all your support during my entire time 
of public service. I love you all very 
much. 
I also want to acknowledge two spe-
cial friends of mine that are here in the 
audience today, Marina Woolcock and 
Dr. John Long. John Long has been an 
adviser and mentor to me my entire ca-
reer in public service. Dr. John Long is 
93 years young, and he is a veteran of 
World War II. If we could just acknowl-
edge Dr. Long and thank him for his 
service to our country. 
Finally, yesterday was my late fa-
ther’s birthday. He would have been 82. 
My father was a doctor in Buffalo, New 
York. I want to wish him a happy 
birthday in heaven, and I want to 
thank him for instilling in me a desire 
to serve others as he did. 
I just want to conclude with a mes-
sage to the citizens of the 27th Con-
gressional District. It is the greatest 
honor of my life to be chosen by you to 
represent you in Congress. As your 
Congressman, I promise to fight hard 
every day for the comeback of our re-
gion and to always serve with honesty 
and integrity. 
Thank you very much.

UNWELCOME TACTICS BY 
FEDERAL AGENTS 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I fear that people don’t really appre-
ciate what is going on in my hometown 
of Portland, Oregon, with the Federal 
interference, so let’s put a face on it. 
Christopher J. David, a 53-year-old 
Navy veteran, graduate of the Naval 
Academy, college wrestler, was con-
cerned about the Pinochet-type behav-
ior of Federal officials in our commu-
nity—uninvited, unwelcomed, and un-
prepared. 
He felt that their actions as Federal 
agents was in violation of their oath to 
support, uphold, and defend the Con-
stitution, which our new colleague just 
accepted. 
When he asked officers how they jus-
tified what they were doing with their 
oath of office, he didn’t get an answer; 
he got pepper sprayed. He was beaten. 
His hand was broken. He is facing sur-
gery to install pins, screws, and plates. 
This is the face of the Trump admin-
istration’s unprecedented interference 
in our community, taking a difficult 
situation and making it worse. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will take a hard look at what is 
going on here, because the Trump ad-
ministration is trying to overshadow 
its other failures with tactics like this. 
There is more on the horizon. 
f 
MFAR TRANSPARENCY ACT 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today urging the administration to 
delay a harmful rule that would be cat-
astrophic 
to 
rural 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers in the 25th Dis-
trict of Texas. 
The coronavirus pandemic has pre-
sented challenges unseen before in 
American history. While all businesses 
have been forced to operate in a new 
environment, 
healthcare 
providers 
have overcome tremendous hurdles to 
meet the needs of their patients, de-
spite historical financial losses. 
Implementation of the Medicaid Fis-
cal Accountability Rule, or MFAR, 
would lead to devastating hospital clo-
sures in Texas and restrict access to 
crucial health services. 
The financial impact alone would 
cost our State nearly $11 billion and 
cause local governments to increase 
taxes, resulting in less care and more 
red tape. 
That is why I am leading the fight on 
behalf of all Texans. I am proud to in-
troduce the bipartisan MFAR Trans-
parency Act to analyze the impact of 
the rule before blindly moving forward 
so that our health systems can con-
tinue to serve patients during the most 
dynamic health crisis of our genera-
tion. 
I thank my colleague, Congress-
woman EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON, for 
joining me in this effort. 
In God we trust.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JIM 
SMITH 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Mr. Jim Smith, a dedicated commu-
nity advocate, a mentor, and the Fa-
ther of Gay Pride on Staten Island. 
Jim was the consummate Staten Is-
lander. As a kid, he was the Staten Is-
land Advance paperboy and a standout 
at Curtis High School. He went on to 
serve his country in the Coast Guard 
and honored his fellow veterans by 
bringing home a Vietnam memorial to 
West Brighton. 
But he is best known as one of the 
founders of Staten Island’s Pride Cen-
ter, where he spent years opening 
hearts and minds to the idea that love 
is love. So, it is only fitting that Jim 
left us on the 51st anniversary of 
Stonewall, leaving behind countless 
Staten Islanders whose lives are better 
for having known him. 
Today, we honor his incredible life, 
and I hope next year we can honor him 
one last time when he looks down and 
sees the Pride Center finally marching 
down Forest Avenue in our St. Pat-
rick’s Day parade.

REVIEWING AMERICA’S ROLE IN 
GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on Thursday, the 
Commission on Unalienable Rights of

Mead in The Wall Street Journal on

‘‘America’s founding was the most 
significant event in the history of 
human rights. . . . Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, who convened the com-
mission . . . doubled down on the com-
bative and incendiary nature of the re-
port.’’

HONORING TIM HARE 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory of someone who 
meant a great deal to my community. 
An architect, artist, preservationist, 
and advocate for equality, Tim Hare 
made an indelible mark on the people 
of Easton, whose historic downtown he 
was instrumental in saving from demo-
lition. 
Passing through Easton by chance in 
the 1970s, Tim was so taken by the 
character of the city that when he 
learned of plans to demolish and evict 
the citizens of the historic district as 
part of a wave of so-called urban re-
newal initiatives, he attended a city 
council meeting to demand answers. 
When that didn’t work, he decided to 
go to Washington to file an injunction 
against 
the 
Federal 
Government’s 
plans. 
Because 
of 
Tim’s 
efforts, 
homes 
across the historic district were saved, 
and local businesses like the Quadrant 
Book Mart & Coffee House are still 
around today. 
Tim’s legacy also endures in the 
struggle for LGBTQ equality, to which 
he devoted himself alongside his be-
loved husband, Earl, and the many gen-
erations he mentored and inspired. 
To Earl, and all those who knew and 
loved Tim, know that I and our entire 
community will work to carry forward 
his example.

COMMENDING JUDGE RICHARD L. 
KELLY 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Judge Richard Leo 
Kelly for a lifetime of distinction and 
service to this Nation. 
Born in Marshall, Minnesota, Judge 
Kelly is a veteran of the Navy and 
served on the USS Noa and USS Willard 
Keith. 
Judge Kelly attended St. John’s Uni-
versity 
in 
Collegeville, 
Minnesota, 
where his role as the football team 
starting quarterback earned him the 
nickname Golden Arm. He went on to 
graduate in the top five of his class 
from the St. Paul College of Law. 
After practicing law for over two dec-
ades in Saint Paul and Springfield, 
Minnesota, he was elected to the Fifth 
District judgeship. He held that office 
for 17 years and was elected chief judge 
twice. 
Throughout his tenure on the bench, 
Judge Kelly was known for his fairness, 
consistency, and courteous nature, in 
keeping with the highest ideals of pub-
lic service. 
In 1998, Governor Arne Carlson de-
clared June 27 to be Judge Richard L. 
Kelly Day, a time to practice and 
honor the principles that Judge Kelly 
embodies. 
Judge Kelly and his wife are resi-
dents of Minnesota’s Sixth Congres-
sional District. It is an honor to serve 
them in Congress. They serve as a tes-
tament of dedication to service and 
honor, a mission that their seven chil-
dren and many grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren have carried on be-
cause of Judge Kelly and Mary’s exem-
plary lives. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Judge Kelly 
for a lifetime of work to our State and 
Nation.

COMMEMORATING AFRICAN- 
AMERICAN HEROES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
just a few minutes ago, I heard Pro-
fessor Meachum indicate that the 
American people voted some years ago 
on one of the most significant mo-
ments of the 20th century, and that 
was a civil rights moment, a civil 
rights movement. 
We now have a significant moment in 
history to combine all the work that 
we need to do to change America’s atti-
tudes on race. We know that we have 
lost two amazing heroes of this Nation, 
C.T. Vivian and Congressman John 
Lewis, whom we will pay tribute to in 
just a few days. 
But I wanted to say today that I am 
very grateful that, in this recent 
NDAA, the Armed Services bill, we 
passed an amendment that would di-
rect the Secretary of Defense to assess 
the heroes, African-American heroes, 
like General Benjamin O. Davis, Gen-
eral 
Chappie 
James, 
as 
well 
as 
Tuskegee Airmen, after which bases 
and other defense properties would be 
named. 
It is now long overdue to honor these 
brave heroes who fought for this Na-
tion, from the Revolutionary War until 
now. I believe we will do that, and I am 
looking forward to that being a piece of 
the civil rights moment, along with 
H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can-Americans Act.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
my colleagues to support the HEALTH 
Act. I am pleased to have introduced 
this bipartisan bill with the support of 
my 
cosponsor, 
Representative 
BUTTERFIELD from North Carolina. 
The HEALTH Act is a bipartisan ef-
fort to help increase access to local 
telehealth. The bill will codify Medi-
care reimbursement for community 
health centers and rural health clinics 
for telehealth services, cutting red tape 
and ensuring that these vital services 
are available to patients on a more per-
manent basis. 
As a lifetime resident of rural Penn-
sylvania, and having spent nearly three 
decades as a therapist and licensed 
nursing home administrator, I have 
been amazed at how telehealth services 
make life easier for rural and under-
served communities, particularly for 
older Americans. 
Now more than ever, access to tele-
health services has become a necessity 
in America. Medicare recipients are in 
need of these services without barriers 
and restrictions, and the HEALTH Act 
will improve access for the under-
served.

RECOGNIZING GAIL’S SALAD 
COMPANY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to recognize Gail’s Salad 
Company in Ocean City, south Jersey. 
Gail’s Salad was founded by Tim 
Janicki, Ben Haberman, David Joslin, 
and Sean Collins, four young men with 
a lot of energy. 
Although the economy is struggling, 
and people have never been further 
apart and polarized in many ways, it is 
phenomenal to see the entrepreneurial 
spirit that south Jersey has and that 
they have, and that that entrepre-
neurial spirit is still alive and well, 
even during the most difficult of times. 
I enjoyed some of their delicious food 
this past weekend. I was proud to join 
Tim, Ben, Dave, and Sean for their 
grand opening. Their assortment of sal-
ads was a fantastic addition to a 
healthy diet. They have fresh ingredi-
ents, 
and 
they 
have 
their 
own 
handcrafted salad dressings. 
Madam Speaker, I wish them and 
Gail’s Salad success for the future. 
Most of all, they are a tremendous ex-
ample to all of us that if we persist and 
we work, we will still thrive, not only 
survive but thrive and do well. 
They are truly a model for all of us, 
and may God bless them.

SUPPORTING TROOPS THROUGH 
NDAA 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, since 
taking office, President Trump has de-
livered on his promise to rebuild our 
military.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3598 
July 21, 2020 
The Mac Thornberry National De-
fense Authorization Act fully funds the 
President’s budget request, authorizing 
funding for national defense commit-
ments at home and abroad. 
This bill includes a 3 percent pay 
raise for our troops and their families. 
If anyone deserves a raise, it is the 
brave men and women in uniform who 
sacrifice so much while defending free-
dom around the world. 
This bill also provides critical invest-
ments in artificial intelligence and 
makes sure our military can prepare 
for and respond to emergent threats 
from 
China 
and 
other 
adversaries 
around the world. 
This bill also provides funding for the 
Space Force, a strategic area where we 
have fallen well behind over the years. 
Parts of this bill also ensure that the 
Department of Defense has the re-
sources to protect our Armed Forces 
from the coronavirus, with funding for 
PPE and testing capabilities. 
Portions of this bill show the world 
that the U.S. military is strong and 
will preserve peace through strength, a 
top priority of President Trump. This 
bill continues to make up for the short-
falls of the past and sends a clear mes-
sage to our servicemembers that we 
have their backs.

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee (during the 
reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, Operation Warp Speed is an unprec-
edented public-private partnership to 
accelerate the development, manufac-
turing, and distribution of COVID–19 
vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. 
One of the goals of this program is to 
have 300 million doses of safe and effec-
tive vaccine by January 2021. Next 
week, Moderna plans to start a phase 3 
trial. Two other companies are right 
behind, expecting to begin phase 3 
within weeks.

taken is truly ‘‘warp speed.’’ This could

not occur without the private sector 
and the Federal Government working 
hand in hand on this herculean effort. 
Companies are taking enormous fi-
nancial risks to conduct research, de-
velop vaccine candidates, and create 
more manufacturing capacity at record 
speed. The Federal Government has 
poured billions more into the vaccine 
effort, yet countries like China are try-
ing to steal America’s work in devel-
oping a COVID vaccine for their ben-
efit. 
As confirmed by intelligence agen-
cies—DHS and FBI—the Chinese Gov-
ernment, the Russian Government, and 
other hackers are trying to steal intel-
lectual property and Americans’ health 
data related to vaccine treatments, 
testing from COVID–19 researchers. In 
fact, DOJ charged Chinese hackers just 
3 hours ago. 
Since the start of this crisis, the Chi-
nese Communist Party has done every-
thing they can to prevent the world 
from responding to and recovering 
from the pandemic. Not only did they 
keep COVID–19 a secret from their own 
citizens, but they hid it from the world 
for months after the first outbreak. 
When word got out about the virus, 
the Chinese Communist Party lied 
about human-to-human transmission. 
Then they arrested doctors, journal-
ists, and other whistleblowers who 
dared to warn their fellow Chinese citi-
zens of the dangers of the virus. Many 
of these whistleblowers are still miss-
ing and presumed dead. 
Researchers 
at 
Columbia 
Univer-
sity—not necessarily a bastion of con-
servatism, I might add—those sci-
entists at Columbia University said, 
had China notified the world just 1 
week sooner, 61 percent of American 
deaths could have been prevented. 
Think about that. Sixty-one percent 
of 143,000 is 87,000-plus Americans who 
would not be dead had China spoken up 
just 1 week sooner. 
Indicative of their past mercantilist 
actions, China hoarded PPE in the 
early days of the virus. Despite domi-
nating 
global 
PPE 
manufacturing, 
China hoarded the world’s PPE. U.S. 
exports of PPE to China grew over 1,000 
percent in January and February com-
pared with the same period last year. 
In their time of need, we sent them 
PPE. Italy even donated PPE to China. 
What did China do? Well, they sold 
them the very PPE Italy had donated 
to them and refused to ship PPE to the 
United States, decrying regulatory vio-
lations, to keep PPE away from us dur-
ing our peak need. 
But it still wasn’t enough. Now the 
Chinese Communist Party is hacking 
researchers who are trying to find a 
cure for the very worldwide pandemic 
that they tried to cover up. 
Make no mistake, if the Chinese 
Communist Party steals the vaccine, 
they will leverage it for their own self- 
interested political and economic ends, 
which really boils down to one thing 
and one thing only: The communists 
want power; they want totalitarian 
power. 
We must show the Chinese Com-
munist Party that there are con-
sequences for these actions which pose 
a clear threat to the safety of our fel-
low Americans. If Chinese companies 
or individuals hack COVID–19 research-
ers, they should be punished with 
tough sanctions. 
This MTR enables sanctions against 
individuals responsible for significant, 
malicious, 
cyber-enabled 
activities 
that endanger the public health of 
Americans. It also requires a report on 
whether cyber hacking related specifi-
cally to COVID–19 qualifies for such 
sanctions. 
Now, to those who say it should go 
through regular order in committee, I 
say we cannot wait. Every day, people 
are dying from COVID–19. We need a 
vaccine now. We cannot afford for 
China to steal American work and then 
leverage it against the United States 
and the world. 
We cannot spare the weeks, maybe 
even months, a stand-alone bill would 
take. Americans are dying, China is 
hacking, and we in Congress must act. 
Researchers need to be protected now. 
We have an opportunity. It is time 
for a bipartisan effort. Think of the 
message that we will send the Chinese 
Communist Party: Hacking American 
intellectual property will not be toler-
ated, especially when it jeopardizes the 
lives of Americans. 
If we can’t agree on punishing those 
who hack the heroes fighting for a cure 
for COVID, I don’t know what we can 
agree on. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this MTR, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of 
my point of order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation of a point of order is with-
drawn. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, legislatively, this is a terrible 
idea, to introduce a 13-page sanctions 
bill at the last possible second and ex-
pect us to vote on it without knowing 
the true impacts of it. 
I absolutely agree that we should 
have tools to hold the Chinese, the 
Russians, anyone accountable who does 
any of the things that the gentleman 
said. Within current law, there are a 
ton of tools to do precisely that. Put-
ting in law brand-new sanctions legis-
lation without thinking about it is a 
bad idea. 
And if this was so crucial and so im-
portant, why are we seeing it just at 
this last second? 
There was somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of 2,000 ideas submitted to be 
added to the defense bill all along the 
process. We would have had time to 
work on it and think about it and actu-
ally craft a decent piece of legislation. 
This clearly does not have that objec-
tive in mind or they would have intro-
duced it a long time ago. This is a bad 
way to make law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge us to vote ‘‘no’’ 
and not to jeopardize all the incredible 
work that Members on both sides of 
the aisle did in this bill. There are a 
ton 
of 
Members, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike; those 2,000 provisions 
are roughly equal between Republicans 
and Democrats. We have an incredibly 
bipartisan piece of legislation before us 
in which individual Members decided 
something is important, worked the 
issue, and got us a product that we 
could support. 
Mr. Speaker, this puts us in the very 
risky position of passing really bad leg-
islation at the last second for no good 
reason, and I would urge Members to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Now, let me be clear. We absolutely 
need 
to 
hold 
accountable 
Russia, 
China, whoever wants to interfere with 
our process of developing a vaccine or 
cyber hack us in any other way, and 
there are an enormous number of tools 
to do so. 
I do want to point out and just sim-
ply make an urgent plea. 
One of the gentleman’s arguments 
was that China hid the true risk of the 
virus from the American people, and, 
yes, that is terrible that China did 
that. It is not actually their job to 
warn the American people. It is the 
President’s job to warn the American 
people. And talk about someone who 
has done a horrible job of warning us of 
the true dangers of the virus. 
It was just, I think, last week, maybe 
a week and a half ago, when the Presi-
dent said 99 percent of the cases will be 
completely harmless. That is wrong. 
The President said again, just a cou-
ple days ago, it is just going to magi-
cally disappear. He cannot even bring 
himself to tell us to wear a mask. 
Some people don’t like mandates. 
Okay. That is fine. Let’s have the lead-
er of our country tell us what we ought 
to do to protect ourselves. 
He is the one who is not warning the 
American people of the true danger of 
this virus, because, sadly, we would 
kind of listen to him. We are not going 
to listen to the Chinese. We don’t trust 
them, for all the reasons they said. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I would implore 
Members on the other side of the aisle, 
ask our President to do what they are 
now asking the Chinese to do. The 
least that he ought to do for the Amer-
ican people is to warn us of the danger 
we face. 
This is incredibly frustrating. I want 
my kids back in school. I want my con-
stituents back to work. If we took the 
virus seriously, if we did the work nec-
essary to contain it, we could do it. 
The President wants to stand up and 
say: Meh. It is not a problem. Nothing 
to worry about it. It is all good. 
We are paying an enormous price for 
that.

So, yes, let’s hold Russia and China 
accountable. Let’s also hold our Presi-
dent and the executive branch account-
able for the spectacular failure in lead-
ership that we are living and, yes, 
dying with today in this country. 
Let’s also oppose this motion to re-
commit as bad legislation that isn’t 
going to make any difference whatso-
ever, and let’s pass the defense bill. 
This is an excellent piece of legisla-
tion, a bipartisan piece of legislation 
that we have all worked on and pro-
duced an excellent product. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to please 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ Please pass this bill, keep 
the legislative process going forward. 
And don’t forget, what we are doing 
here is providing for the national secu-
rity, providing for the Department of 
Defense, providing for the men and 
women whom we are asking to put 
their lives on the line for the defense of 
this country, giving them the support 
they need and they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to vote 
down the motion to recommit and vote 
for the national defense authorization 
act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 201, nays

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 21, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I write to respect-

SUPPORTING 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the fiscal 
year 2021 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act stands apart from previous 
years. Our military continues count-
less measures abroad to ensure our se-
curity here at home. This year, they 
are also called upon to battle the 
COVID pandemic at home. 
The chairman’s bill aligns our na-
tional security interests with our Na-
tional Defense Strategy. It enables for-
ward movement on the future of dis-
ruptive innovation, challenging busi-
ness as usual. 
Importantly, this bill creates a Pan-
demic Preparedness and Resilience Na-
tional Security Fund. It directs $1 bil-
lion to proactively prepare for and re-
spond to future pandemics. 
Additionally, it authorizes an Assist-
ant Secretary to provide important 
guidance and support to undergird our 
defense industrial base to ensure a sup-
ply of materials critical to our na-
tional security and provide extra sup-
port to expand the small business in-
dustrial base. 
Further, it creates a more inclusive 
military. This range of talents will 
benefit our national security as much 
as weapons and ammunition. 
Our obligation as Congress is not to 
flinch in the face of crisis and pan-
demic. We must provide our military 
with the means to remain a vigilant 
and ready force able to defend against 
any threat to American values and our 
way of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support 
for the fiscal year 2021 National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
f 
HONORING IRA KATZ 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor a champion. 
Ira Katz, a registered pharmacist and 
owner of Little Five Points Pharmacy, 
was recognized as Champion for Opioid 
Safety by the Georgia Pharmacy Asso-
ciation. He received this title after 
completing a series of educational pro-
gramming aimed at reducing opioid-re-
lated overdoses. 
Everything began when he was con-
nected to a local needle exchange oper-
ation and was made aware of the need 
to 
provide 
opioid 
education 
and 
Naloxone, or Narcan, to whoever need-
ed it. Naloxone is a drug that reverses 
opioid overdoses. 
According to the CDC, overdoses in-
volving opioids killed nearly 47,000 peo-
ple in 2018, and 32 percent of those 
deaths involved prescription opioids. 
That number is far too high, which is 
why we desperately need people like 
Ira Katz fighting on the front lines to 
save countless lives for a more positive 
future. 
As the only pharmacist currently 
serving in Congress, I understand the 
importance of fighting the opioid epi-
demic and serving one’s community 
with the utmost integrity. 
I applaud Ira Katz for his 39 years of 
hard work to serve the people of the 
Atlanta community, and I wish him all 
the best in the years to come. 
f 
RECOGNIZING L’MIO EDWARDS 
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, during 
this pandemic, many companies and in-
dividuals in California’s 39th have gone 
above and beyond to help and support 
others. Some have donated PPE; others 
raised money; some even changed their 
entire business operation to support 
the district. 
But today I want to mention one 
young lady, L’Mio Edwards, a rising 
freshman at Diamond Bar High School 
and the number five cross country run-
ner for her age group in the country. 
Using her gift as a talented runner, 
L’Mio committed to running a 5K for 30 
consecutive days in order to raise 
money for local food banks to support 
families during COVID–19. So far, she 
has raised thousands of dollars and 
helped hundreds of people. 
Last Saturday, I had the honor of 
joining this young lady for a run, and 
she blew me away both with her com-
mitment to support her community 
and with her speed, leaving me in her 
dust. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in saluting L’Mio Edwards for 
her commitment to her community 
and our country.

CELEBRATING WICHITA’S 150TH 
BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. ESTES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 150th birthday of my 
hometown, Wichita, Kansas. 
Our history began as a trading post 
at the confluence of the Arkansas and 
Little Arkansas Rivers. 
Around 1930, a booming oil industry 
and the flat planes of Kansas fostered 
the formation of aircraft manufactur-
ers 
like 
Cessna, 
Stearman, 
and 
Beechcraft, creating a rich aviation 
history in the Air Capital of the World. 
Pizza Hut, Coleman, and Freddie’s 
Frozen Custard can also claim Wichita 
as their founding city. And notable 
Americans like Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, Emmy Award winner 
Kirstie Alley, famed lawman Wyatt 
Earp, Olympic athlete Jim Ryun, and 
Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel are all 
part of Wichita’s unique and influential 
story. 
Our strong work ethic, Native Amer-
ican heritage, Kansas values, and deep 
agribusiness and manufacturing roots 
make Wichita the perfect American 
city to live, work, and play. 
I am looking forward to Wichita’s 
next 150 years.

OUR CITIES, TOWNS, AND SCHOOLS 
DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES 
THEY NEED 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of the HEROES Act. 
The messages I receive paint a stark 
picture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3609 
July 21, 2020 
Steve, in Rockford, Illinois, prays the 
unemployment 
benefits 
that 
have 
saved his home will be extended beyond 
next week. 
Sharon, in Moline, Illinois, worries 
that her beloved niece may be out of 
work for another 6 months. 
John, in Sterling, Illinois, is con-
cerned the outlook for small towns like 
his will only worsen. 
But perhaps the most touching letter 
that I have received is from a young 
boy from the town of Orion, who just 
wants to go back to school safely. 
As conversations ramp up across the 
Nation about whether classes should 
return, one thing is certain: Our cities, 
our towns, and our schools do not have 
the resources that they need. 
Whether it is funding to increase 
testing or funding for personal protec-
tive equipment or expanded broadband 
to make sure that distance learning is 
an option, we cannot expect schools to 
return or our Nation to rebuild without 
support. 
America has waited for months. It is 
past time to pass the HEROES Act.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL INTER-
AGENCY FIRE CENTER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week we celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the National Interagency Fire Cen-
ter. 
Established in Boise, Idaho, in 1970, 
the NIFC supports the Federal emer-
gency 
response 
for 
wildland 
fire-
fighting across the country. Eight dif-
ferent agencies look to the NIFC for di-
rection and coordination on how to 
best respond to wildland fires. 
This year’s fire season is already un-
derway. I have two in my northern 
California district, at least, and it will 
be very active. The NIFC will play a 
critical role in supporting and coordi-
nating these fire operations across the 
West. 
The NIFC proves that our emergency 
response efforts are stronger when 
agencies work together, and I thank 
the workers who help support our Na-
tion’s firefighters. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the NIFC for 50 
years 
of 
service 
to 
our 
Nation’s 
wildlands, firefighters, and for public 
safety.

HONORING HENRY GONZALEZ 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, Cali-
fornia’s 44th Congressional District 
lost a longtime South Gate champion 
and my friend, Henry Gonzalez. 
Besides being a confidant and adviser 
to me on many occasions, he spent dec-
ades serving the city of South Gate as 
a council member, mayor, and commu-
nity leader. 
Henry became the first Latino elect-
ed to the city council and served as 
mayor of South Gate for six different 1- 
year terms. 
‘‘Hammerin Hank,’’ as he was called 
by many, championed the priorities of 
hardworking families. He was a labor 
leader with the United Auto Workers, 
and his entire family was involved in 
the union’s fight for workers’ rights. 
Henry was a dedicated public servant 
who demonstrated honesty, integrity, 
and commitment to our community 
during the most challenging times. He 
even survived an assassination attempt 
on his life. 
Henry left an imprint on our commu-
nity and inspired me. His legacy will be 
remembered for years to come. 
f 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mr. GRIFFITH (at the request of Mr.

S4309 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2020 
No. 128 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, thank You for the gift 
of this day. Open the minds of our law-
makers and give them a vision of the 
unlimited 
possibilities 
available 
to 
those who trust You as their guide. 
May our Senators embrace a humility 
that seeks first to understand rather 
than to be understood. Inspire them to 
seek Your wisdom as You sustain them 
with Your grace, mercy, and peace. 
Lord, remind them that You will judge 
their fruits, productivity, and faithful-
ness. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. The U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement entered into force 
on July 1, and I am eager to see the 
modernized agreement deliver on its 
promises to spur job growth for Amer-
ican farmers, workers, and businesses, 
and even help our innovators. Also, at 
the same time, it will create new op-
portunities with our North American 
trading partners. 
The U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
fixes many problems we had for 30 
years under NAFTA, and it also creates 
several new, modern trade provisions 
for our 21st century economy—things 
that were negotiated that weren’t even 
thought of 30 years ago when NAFTA 
was negotiated. However, even with 
this agreement going into effect and 
being a tough agreement to negotiate, 
it isn’t going to be simple from here on 
out. There is plenty of work remaining 
to ensure the agreement is imple-
mented fully and properly. 
I urge the administration to be expe-
ditious in addressing any enforcement 
issues or noncompliance from our trad-
ing partners under the dispute settle-
ment mechanism. I also encourage 
close consultation between Congress 
and the administration so we may con-
tinue to be successful in the U.S-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement implementation 
efforts—allowing Americans to reap 
the benefits of this agreement. 
I raised questions with the adminis-
tration, but I have no doubt that they 
are going to be on top of it. I remember 
President Trump as a candidate, 2015 to 
2016, running on a platform to get rid of 
NAFTA. Trump was elected. By May of 
his first year in office, Trump started 
negotiations. They were successful ne-
gotiations. NAFTA is now gone. Now 
USMCA is going into effect. 
Trump delivered on his campaign 
promise. I have no doubt that he will 
see that the U.S-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment is properly implemented. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our Nation stands at a crucial midway 
point in our battle against this terrible 
virus. The heroism of healthcare pro-
fessionals, essential workers, and fami-
lies from coast to coast got our Nation 
through a springtime like no other. 
Communities across America put nor-
mal life on pause to buy breathing 
room for our medical system. We essen-
tially had to winterize the world’s larg-
est economy for weeks on end and 
spare our people as much of the result-
ing pain as possible. The task was his-
toric, and so was the Senate’s response. 
We wrote and passed the CARES Act— 
the largest rescue package in American 
history. Our legislation helped pull 
both our health system and our econ-
omy back from the brink. Tens of mil-
lions of jobs were saved. The hallways 
of our hospitals did not become Italy. 
The Senate’s leadership helped the Na-
tion endure the first phase of this, but 
this crisis is far from over. 
The virus that has claimed 140,000 
American lives has not gone anywhere. 
As some places step back toward nor-
malcy, infections are climbing again in 
hotspots across our country. The start 
of our economic recovery has been 
sharp and impressive, but in absolute 
terms, we still have just begun to pick 
up the pieces. Our progress so far has 
been encouraging, but it remains frag-
ile and far from sufficient. I would 
argue that our country’s job now is 
even more complex than it was back in 
March. 
Now, as then, we need to keep our 
health system robust, but now, instead 
of locking down the country to do it, 
we want to stand up a society that 
functions somewhat more normally at 
the same time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4310 
July 21, 2020 
The American people cannot com-
pletely stop building their lives until 
the vaccine is available. The United 
States of America was not built for a 
defensive crouch. We need to stand up 
an educational system and an economy 
that works for workers and families in 
the meantime. We need to find the 
right sort of middle ground—middle 
ground that is smart and safe but also 
more sustainable. It is another historic 
set of challenges and another oppor-
tunity for the U.S. Senate to deliver. 
For weeks now, I have made it clear 
that further legislation out of the Sen-
ate will be a serious response to the 
crisis. We will not be wasting the 
American people’s time like the House 
Democrats, with their multimillion- 
dollar proposal for high taxes on small 
businesses, cut taxes for blue-State 
millionaires, and send diversity detec-
tives into the cannabis industry. 
I have said we will start with the 
facts and develop real, targeted solu-
tions on the subjects that matter most 
to American families. It turns out that 
means three things: kids, jobs, and 
healthcare—kids, jobs, and healthcare. 
Surveys show the American people’s 
top 
priorities 
for 
reopening 
are 
childcare and K–12 schools. This coun-
try wants its kids back in the class-
room this fall—learning, exploring, 
making friends. Their educations de-
pend on it. In some cases, their safety 
depends on it, and so do the livelihoods 
of working parents. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
stated unambiguously that our goal 
must be in-person—in-person instruc-
tion. But of course, parents, teachers, 
and doctors all agree it has to be as 
safe as possible. That is where the Sen-
ate comes in. 
This majority is preparing legislation 
that will send $105 billion so educators 
have the resources they need to safely 
reopen. That is more money than the 
House Democrats set aside for a simi-
lar fund, by the way, and that is in ad-
dition to support for childcare needs. It 
is amazing how you can find room to 
fund serious priorities when you take a 
pass on the far-left daydreams. 
Second, the economic slowdown has 
hurt millions and millions of Ameri-
cans. Before this crisis, we had never 
had 7 million Americans receiving un-
employment at the same time. Today, 
we have 17 million. More than a million 
people have filed new unemployment 
claims every single week for more than 
4 months now. 
The American job market needs an-
other shot of adrenaline. Senate Re-
publicans are laser-focused on getting 
American workers their jobs back. Our 
bill takes several specific incentives to 
hire and retain workers and turn the 
dials on those policies way up. The leg-
islation will help reimburse for safe 
workplaces so Main Street can afford 
the PPE, testing, cleaning, or remod-
eling to protect workers and entice 
customers. 
The ingenuity and spirit of America’s 
small business isn’t possible to over-
state, but they still face a tough road. 
With the majority of businesses ex-
pected to exhaust their initial Pay-
checks Protection Funding this sum-
mer, we will also be proposing a tar-
geted second round of the PPP with a 
special eye toward hard-hit businesses. 
Speaking of building on what worked 
in the CARES Act, we want another 
round of direct payments—direct pay-
ments to help American families keep 
driving our national comeback. Help-
ing to create more Americans jobs is 
an urgent, moral priority, and these 
are just some of the policies we are dis-
cussing that will help that happen. 
In addition to kids and jobs, our 
third major focus is healthcare. The 
reason is obvious. The reason is obvi-
ous. If we lose control of the virus or if 
research stalls, then everything else 
will be window dressing. 
Our proposal will dedicate even more 
resources to the fastest race for a new 
vaccine in human history, along with 
diagnostics and treatments. Our bill 
will also protect seniors from a poten-
tial spike in premiums. And the Fed-
eral Government will continue to sup-
port hospitals, providers, and testing. 
These are just some of the elements 
that Senate Republicans are discussing 
among ourselves and with the adminis-
tration. There is one more central pro-
posal 
that 
ties 
kids, 
jobs, 
and 
healthcare all together. 
As I have said for months, the next 
recovery package will include strong 
legal protections for the healthcare 
workers who save strangers’ lives and 
the schools, colleges, charities, and 
businesses that want to reopen. The 
American people will not see their his-
toric recovery gobbled up by trial law-
yers who are itching to follow this pan-
demic with a second epidemic of frivo-
lous lawsuits. 
Gross negligence will still be action-
able, but we are creating a safe harbor 
for institutions that make good-faith 
efforts to follow the guidelines avail-
able to them. Doctors and nurses clear-
ly deserve this protection, and school 
districts, universities, nonprofits, and 
small businesses will need it, as well, if 
we want any genuine reopening at all. 
The legislation that I have begun to 
sketch out is neither another CARES 
Act to float the entire economy nor a 
typical stimulus bill for a nation that 
is ready to get back to normal. Our 
country is in a complex middle ground 
between those two things. We can’t go 
back to April, and we can’t snap our 
fingers and finish the vaccine over-
night. We need to carve out a new nor-
mal. 
Senate Republicans are continuing to 
discuss these and other ideas among 
our conference and with the adminis-
tration. The majority will be laying 
down another historic proposal very 
soon. Here in the Senate, an outcome 
will require bipartisan discussions. 
I do not believe there will be any-
thing in our bill that our Democratic 
colleagues should not happily support, 
but we will stand ready and eager to 
work together and produce a bipartisan 
outcome. 
As I said yesterday, in March the 
Senate gave a historic master class in 
how to pass major bipartisan legisla-
tion. The CARES Act, the largest res-
cue package ever, was drafted by Re-
publicans, promptly negotiated across 
the aisle with Democrats, and then 
passed urgently without a single dis-
senting vote. 
Last month, in June, we recorded a 
master class in how not to make a law. 
Instead 
of 
amending 
Senator 
TIM 
SCOTT’s JUSTICE Act, our Democratic 
colleagues flat-out blocked him. They 
filibustered the issue of police reform 
altogether. Well, for the sake of Amer-
ica’s kids, jobs, and healthcare, let’s 
hope our Democratic friends bring 
their bipartisan urgency and good faith 
to the process and leave the partisan 
poses behind. 
The Senate has led every step of this 
crisis. We need to rise to the task one 
more time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4311 
July 21, 2020 
hardly know it. Over the past several 
months, 
even 
as 
COVID–19 
surged 
through the country once again, even 
as our States hit new records of infec-
tions and hospitalizations, the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate dithered 
and delayed on the next phase of major 
emergency relief. 
In April, May, and June, Democrats 
tried to jolt the Senate into action, but 
almost every time we tried to pass 
much needed legislation by average 
Americans, our Republican colleagues 
objected. 
Unemployment 
claims 
reached 50 million. The number of 
cases topped 3.8 million as the virus re-
surged over the past several weeks, and 
more than 140,000 Americans have died. 
Still, Senate Republicans wanted to, in 
the words of their leader, ‘‘hit the 
pause button’’ and ‘‘assess the condi-
tions’’ in the country before providing 
any more relief. The country was burn-
ing, and Senate Republicans, led by 
Leader MCCONNELL, said: ‘‘Let’s wait a 
little longer and see how this goes.’’ 
Like President Trump, they were 
hoping it would go away, ignoring all 
of the scientific evidence but paying 
obeisance to the hard right, which 
didn’t want to spend money no matter 
what the cost to America. 
Now it seems our Republican friends 
have finally found the motivation to do 
another emergency relief bill. Even 
they, with their heads still half in the 
sand, have to see the crisis the country 
is in. But instead of working with 
Democrats in either the Senate or the 
House, Leader MCCONNELL has decided 
to write the bill behind the closed 
doors of his office—the same partisan, 
one-side-only process that has failed 
time and again to produce successful 
legislation in the Senate. 
MCCONNELL
talked about how the 
Senate led in the last three bills. I 
would add a word to that. It was Sen-
ate Democrats that led. Republicans 
put a small, stingy, corporate-oriented 
proposal before the Senate. We said no, 
and they were forced to add provisions 
friendly to workers and average Amer-
ican families. That is what happened. 
History knows that. 
Yesterday, Leader MCCONNELL, once 
again, called for the same spirited bi-
partisanship that helped us pass the 
CARES Act. Well, Leader MCCONNELL, 
writing a bill in your own office with-
out any input from Democrats, drop-
ping it on the floor, and demanding 
that Democrats support it is no one’s 
idea of bipartisanship. You can’t fool 
the American people with these facile 
words that just don’t ring true. 
Even worse, the Republican proposal 
appears destined to fall drastically 
short of what is required. From all in-
dications, the bill will prioritize cor-
porate special interests over workers 
and Main Street businesses. It will not 
provide hazard pay for essential work-
ers. It will not provide new funding to 
State, local, and Tribal governments or 
enough investments in communities of 
color that have been ravaged by the 
virus. 
Enhanced 
unemployment 
benefits 
will expire at the end of the month. Ac-
cording to reports, the Republican bill 
will not do nearly enough to aid the 20 
to 30 million Americans currently un-
employed. We have heard Republicans 
debate a credit for Americans who are 
going back to work, but those are the 
very same Americans who will be get-
ting a salary again. What about Ameri-
cans who remain unemployed and actu-
ally need the help? 
The moratorium on evictions expires 
this week. According to reports, the 
Republican bill will not do anything 
for the millions of Americans who 
can’t afford the rent and could get 
kicked out of their apartments. After 
all the hemming and hawing and the 
delay, which cost America so much— 
months of delay—it appears the next 
Republican proposal on COVID will not 
even come close to meeting the mo-
ment. 
It has become clear over the last few 
weeks that the reason our Republican 
colleagues have taken so long to put 
even this inadequate proposal together 
is because they are paralyzed by inter-
nal divisions among themselves and by 
division with the President. 
According to reports in the press, 
even after all these months that our 
Republican colleagues spent ‘‘assess-
ing’’ the conditions in the country, the 
White House and Senate Republicans 
are starkly divided about what to do. 
The Trump administration is fixated 
on a payroll tax cut, an idea that will 
not only harm those who rely on Social 
Security but will do nothing for the 
tens of millions of Americans who lost 
their jobs during the crisis. Many of 
my Republican colleagues aren’t too 
keen on that idea, with good reason. 
Yet it may still be in MCCONNELL’s pro-
posal because he and the other Repub-
licans are afraid to tell President 
Trump no, even when they know he is 
wrong. 
Recent reports also suggest that the 
administration is trying to block bil-
lions of dollars from going to the 
States in order to improve their test-
ing and contact tracing capabilities. 
Can you imagine? Republicans are ar-
guing about whether to block funds for 
testing and tracing, the two most im-
portant tools in our arsenal to manage 
this crisis right now. It is amazing. 
Americans are hanging their heads in 
some degree of shame at the Presi-
dent’s actions because every other de-
veloped 
country—just 
about 
every 
other one in Europe and East Asia—is 
doing much better than us because 
they have leadership and their leader-
ship provided, above all, testing and 
tracing. This President refuses to do it, 
and the Republicans say nothing. They 
are so afraid of President Trump, even 
when they know he is wrong. Even 
when millions of lives are at stake, 
even when the economy is at stake, 
they just are deathly silent. 
What do they end up doing? Well, the 
one thing that unites Trump and all 
the Republicans is pleasing corporate 
interests. So if reports are accurate, 
the Republicans are doing just that. 
They are pleasing corporate interests, 
not workers and families and small 
businesses, and that will not get the 
job done. 
For 60 days, Senate Democrats have 
been clear about where we should start 
the 
negotiations. 
The 
Heroes 
Act 
passed by the House provides crucial 
relief for education funding, for hos-
pitals and medical workers, for essen-
tial workers on the frontlines, and for 
State and local governments. 
Right now Republicans seem to want 
to play chicken with pandemic relief 
and string everyone along with a bill 
and a process we all know is doomed to 
fail. 
I urge all of my Republican col-
leagues to abandon their one-party, 
one-Chamber approach before it is too 
late and immediately begin bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations on the next 
round of COVID legislation. 
The problems, of course, don’t end 
with the Republican Senate. We are 
living through one of the greatest fail-
ures of Presidential leadership in our 
country’s history. 
Do you hear that, Donald Trump? 
You have created one of the greatest 
failures of Presidential leadership in 
our country’s entire history and the 
history books will record it that way. 
President Trump cannot even model 
good behavior and consistently encour-
age Americans to wear a mask. 
When the White House coronavirus 
briefings 
resume, 
President 
Trump 
should not take the podium. Every 
time President Trump takes the po-
dium at one of these briefings, he is a 
threat to public health. Even after 
140,000 lives were lost to COVID, the 
President claimed again on Sunday 
that this disease will disappear. It has 
been over 6 months since the start of 
the virus, and this Trump administra-
tion still lacks a national testing strat-
egy. The administration ordered hos-
pitals to hide their coronavirus data 
from the CDC. 
The President is pressuring schools 
to reopen this fall without the nec-
essary resources or guidance to keep 
our kids safe. 
Remember, President Trump, you 
pushed Republican Governors to open 
their States too early, and look at 
what happened. You are now making 
the same mistake with schools. COVID 
surged through those States that re-
opened too quickly, and many now are 
being forced to reimpose restrictions. 
We cannot repeat those mistakes when 
it comes to the schools and safety of 
our kids and our families. 
The question looms over this Cham-
ber: When will our Republican friends 
stand up to President Trump and tell 
him to get his act together—when push 
comes to shove, when people’s health 
and even lives are at stake? It seems 
that Senate Republicans are always 
too timid, too afraid to buck the Presi-
dent.

Will they stand up and tell him he is 
wrong to block more funding for test-

REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, John 
Lewis was a great American, but there 
was a humility in his heart that 
showed his greatness even more, and he 
gave speeches that stirred a nation. 
Who among us can forget his trade-
mark speech of explaining how, as a 
young man, growing up on a farm, he 
practiced public speaking to an audi-
ence of chickens? He told that story 
over and over again. 
John Lewis used to say, ‘‘People 
come up to me in the airport, and they 
say, ‘I’m going to cry. I’m going to 
pass out.’ ’’ 
John’s reply was, ‘‘Please, don’t pass 
out; I’m not a doctor.’’ 
John Lewis was a healer and a balm 
for troubled souls. I was struck by an 
article in the Atlanta newspaper that 
talked about an incident that occurred 
in January of 2009. 
A former Ku Klux Klan member, 
Elwin Wilson, confessed to being part 
of the White mob that had bloodied 
John Lewis and other Freedom Riders 
in Rock Hill, SC, nearly 48 years be-
fore. Lewis noted in his 2012 book 
‘‘Across That Bridge’’ that Wilson was 
the first of his attackers to apologize 
for his actions. Wilson traveled to 
Washington a short while later to meet 
Lewis face-to-face and ask for forgive-
ness. 
‘‘Without a moment of hesitation, I 
looked back at him and said, ‘I accept 
your apology,’ ’’ John Lewis wrote. 
This was a great testament to the 
power of love to overcome hatred. 
John Lewis had another incident 
that I thought was worth mentioning 
this morning, as well, that was another 
example of the forgiveness. 
Kevin Murphy wasn’t born until a 
year after John Lewis was knocked un-
conscious by a blow from a wooden 
Coca-Cola crate in 1961 after the Free-
dom Riders pulled into the bus station 
in Montgomery, AL. As the city’s po-
lice chief in 2013, Mr. Murphy wanted 
to issue an apology for the officers who 
declined to step in as a White mob de-
scended on Lewis and his bus-riding 
colleagues. So, when Lewis and other 
dignitaries assembled at Montgomery’s 
First Baptist Church to commemorate 
the event, Murphy walked to the 
microphone and offered Lewis what 
was long a symbol of oppression for 
many African Americans—his police 
badge. Murphy told Lewis he hoped it 
would serve as a token of reconcili-
ation. 
‘‘I often said, when I started going up 
through the ranks, that if I had a 
chance—if I ever became police chief— 
that I was going to try to right that 
wrong,’’ said Murphy during an inter-
view—now the deputy sheriff for Mont-
gomery County, AL. He went on to say: 
‘‘A lot of my peers didn’t want to talk 
about it. They didn’t want to face the 
truth.’’ 
Because of that gesture, John Lewis 
and Kevin Murphy struck up a friend-
ship, and John Lewis invited Murphy 
to the White House to meet President 
Barack Obama. Then the two of them, 
both Lewis and Murphy, traveled to 
Ireland and Northern Ireland to talk 
with Catholics and Protestants about 
bridging the religious divide. 
Murphy said he was awed by Lewis’s 
capacity to walk through the world 
with an open heart. You can just tell, 
with everything he had been through, 
that he wasn’t a bitter man. He truly 
had tried to put a lot of what hap-
pened—the 
injustices—behind 
him. 
That was John Lewis. 
It is a miracle that he didn’t die 
when angry Klansmen and their sym-
pathizers torched the bus that carried 
a young John Lewis and other Freedom 
Riders near Anniston, AL, in 1961. It is 
amazing that he survived the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, on Bloody Sunday in 
1965, when the Alabama State troopers 
nearly beat him to death. Clearly, 
there was a purpose in his life that had 
to be served. 
I had the honor to serve with Con-
gressman Lewis in the House for 10 
years, and I called him my friend for 
nearly 40 years. For a man who had 
witnessed the depths of hatred and de-
spair, John Lewis was one of the most 
hopeful people I had ever met. He once 
said the only time he came close to 
giving up was after the murder of Rob-
ert Kennedy in 1968. Martin Luther 
King had been assassinated 2 months 
earlier. So when Bobby Kennedy died, 
it seemed for a few weeks that any 
hope for justice and equality had died 
too. That is what John Lewis said. Yet 
he didn’t allow despair to overcome 
him. He didn’t spend his life hoping for 
better; he spent his life making the 
world better. He still had hope, and he 
had a profound belief in the future of 
this Nation. 
I was reminded this weekend of a 
story that captured so well John Lew-
is’s humility and his enormous redemp-
tive influence on America. It was Janu-
ary 20, 2009—a day I will never forget. 
Barack Obama was sworn in to be the 
first African-American President of the 
United States. As he was leaving the 
podium, John Lewis stepped forward to 
the new President and asked him to 
sign his inauguration program. The 
President hesitated, pulled out a pen, 
and wrote the following inscription: 
‘‘Because 
of 
you, 
John. 
Barack 
Obama.’’ 
John Lewis was an icon of the Amer-
ican civil rights movement. If he had 
confined his life’s work to only ending 
racial injustice, he would have still 
been in the pantheon of heroes, but his 
vision and faith were bigger than jus-
tice for just one group. His commit-
ment was to genuine democracy and 
equality. He said so many times: ‘‘You 
cannot build a wall when it comes to 
equality; it must be equality for all 
and not for some.’’ He told us: ‘‘We 
must be headlights, not taillights.’’ 
For John, being a headlight meant 
going out ahead and shining a light so 
that we could see the people living in 
the cold shadows of discrimination and 
bring them into the warmth of Amer-
ica’s promise. 
He challenged us always to expand 
our concepts of justice and equality— 
as he said, ‘‘to respect the dignity and 
worth of every human being, Black or 
White, Latino or Asian, immigrant to 
Native American, gay, straight, Mus-
lims, Christians, Jews.’’ John spoke for 
all of them. How many times did he 
tell us: ‘‘We are one people, one family; 
we live in one house’’? 
One of the great injustices for our 
times was overly harsh drug laws. It 
was a measure passed in the 1980s and 
1990s that disproportionately harmed 
people and communities of color. Many 
of us worked for years to replace those 
biased laws. John Lewis was deeply 
committed to our cause. 
About 2 years ago, a proposal was of-
fered that would have shifted the focus 
of our efforts and really walked away 
from a commitment to criminal sen-
tencing reform. It was John Lewis who 
stepped up. His steadfast insistence 
made a difference, and it resulted in 
having the FIRST STEP Act being 
signed into law. 
Rosa Parks was one of John Lewis’s 
heroes. When she died in October 2005, 
her body lay in the Rotunda of the U.S. 
Capitol. Tens of thousands of people 
filed past to pay their respects to this 
great heroine of justice who had the 
courage to refuse to sit in the seg-
regated portion of that bus. They came 
all night and all the next morning. 
Late at night, John Lewis walked 
quietly into the Rotunda. He waited in 
line with every other mourner. Accom-
panying him were a handful of blind 
men and women who were using white 
canes. That was John Lewis, showing 
the way by quiet and powerful exam-
ple. He showed us that the promise of 
America is the promise of dignity for 
everyone. In John’s eyes, none of us is 
free until all of us are free. 
Born in rural Troy, AL, the son and 
grandson of sharecroppers, he saw the 
injustice of Jim Crow even when he 
was a young boy. When he was 15, he 
discovered a man who became an iconic 
leader and his personal mentor. At that 
age, John bought a comic book entitled 
‘‘Martin Luther King and the Mont-
gomery Story.’’ It was 14 pages long, 
and it cost him a dime, but it touched 
his heart and inspired his life. That 
thin dime had yielded arguably the 
greatest return on investment of any 
purchase in the history of our Nation. 
Now we are asked, how should we 
honor this man?

S4313 
July 21, 2020 
It was a little over 10 years ago that 
I joined the Faith & Politics pilgrim-
age and made a trip to Alabama. It was 
a weekend that John had led for so 
many years wherein we visited the 
shrines of the American civil rights 
movements. We saw the monument and 
tribute to Rosa Parks, and we went to 
the church where those little girls were 
killed in Birmingham. Unfortunately, 
my schedule was such that I had to 
leave before we actually visited Selma, 
which was to occur at 12 noon on Sun-
day. 
I went to John and said: I am sorry I 
can’t be there, as I have always wanted 
to be on that Selma bridge and to hear 
your story in your own words. 
He said: You have got to come. We 
will make a special trip. I will meet 
you in the lobby of the hotel at 6:30 in 
the morning, and we will drive over 
and see it. I will take you on that tour. 
How could I possibly say no? 
I said: I will be there in the lobby. 
Let’s go. 
And off we went. 
We talked all the way over about his 
memories of what led to that march in 
Selma. He was the one who told me 
personally how Federal Judge Frank 
Johnson had often been overlooked but 
that if it were not for his rulings that 
had allowed that march to go forward, 
it might never have happened. 
It was an inspirational visit for me to 
be there in the early Sunday morning 
hours on that misty day, standing at 
the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, 
right next to John Lewis. He pointed 
down, just at the foot of the bridge, 
and said: 
That’s where I fell. That’s where they hit 
me. 
There is a lot of talk about what to 
do next to honor John Lewis. There has 
been talk of renaming the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge in his honor. I am not 
opposed to that. I think that humble 
bridge is becoming a defining piece of 
American history. Yet John Lewis did 
not risk his life on Bloody Sunday for 
the right to rename a bridge; he risked 
his life for the right of every man and 
woman in America to vote and to have 
a voice in our democracy. John said so 
many times that the right to vote is 
precious, that it is almost sacred, and 
that it is the most powerful, non-
violent tool we have. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has 
been weakened and whittled down by 
recent Supreme Court and other court 
decisions and by the actions of this De-
partment of Justice. In December, the 
House of Representatives voted to re-
store the Voting Rights Act. John 
Lewis presided over the U.S. House of 
Representatives on the day of that im-
portant vote. That bill to restore the 
Voting Rights Act has been sitting on 
Senator MCCONNELL’s desk for more 
than 225 days. 
Words of praise for John Lewis are 
fine, but they are not enough. This 
Senate should honor the life and the 
sacrifice of John Lewis by voting to re-
store the Voting Rights Act. There are 
some who are trying mightily to di-
minish American’s faith in our democ-
racy and our elections. We can honor 
John Lewis by protecting the right to 
vote. Let’s do it and do it now. 
Let me close with another story I 
learned about John Lewis this week-
end. We have seen those iconic photos 
of the 23-year-old John Lewis as he led 
those marchers across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge in 1965—a young man, 
dressed in a tan trench coat, with a 
backpack. John Lewis had been ar-
rested before for nonviolent protests. 
He just had a hunch that he was going 
to be arrested again that day and 
jailed, so in his backpack he had his 
toothbrush, toothpaste, an apple, an 
orange, and two books. 
One book was ‘‘The Seven Storey 
Mountain’’ by the Catholic monk and 
mystic Thomas Merton. That book 
spoke about the power of hope to trans-
form abstract principles into realities 
that, one day, if necessary, we would be 
willing to sacrifice and even die for. 
On that day, the other book in John 
Lewis’s backpack was entitled ‘‘The 
American 
Political 
Tradition.’’ 
It 
opened with a quote from the writer 
John Dos Passos. Here is what it read: 
‘‘In times of change and danger when 
there is quicksand of fear under men’s 
reasoning, a sense of continuity with 
generations gone before can stretch 
like 
a 
lifeline 
across 
the 
scary 
present.’’ 
John Lewis was the bridge that con-
nected the civil rights generation with 
what we see today in the streets of 
America—again, a common effort to 
make sure we fulfill the promise of 
equality for everyone. John Lewis was 
heartened by the Black Lives Matter 
movement. His last public appearance 
was here in Washington in the area 
they have reserved for speaking their 
minds about this important issue. 
In this time of change and loss, may 
we honor the legacy of John Lewis and 
find within us the hope and courage to 
continue his work, as he reminded us 
that the cause of justice and equality 
is the cause of a lifetime. 
PROTESTS 
Madam President, let me start by 
saying that there is no place for vio-
lence or vandalism in the exercise of 
any constitutional right. The use of 
force against peaceful protesters or 
members of law enforcement in the 
reasonable exercise of their respon-
sibilities is unacceptable. 
In recent days, President Trump has 
indicated that he wants to send Fed-
eral agents into cities, including Chi-
cago, to conduct policing activities 
that are traditionally handled by local 
law enforcement. 
The Chicago Tribune has reported 
that the Department of Homeland Se-
curity is developing a plan to send an 
additional 150 agents to Chicago as 
soon as this weekend, although details 
have not been made public as to what 
they are going to do. 
I join Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illi-
nois and Chicago Mayor Lightfoot in 
strongly urging the Trump administra-
tion to refrain from taking any action 
that resembles what has occurred in 
Portland, OR. Any involvement by 
Federal law enforcement in community 
policing activity must be conducted in 
coordination with and with the ap-
proval of local law enforcement offi-
cials. In this time of heightened ten-
sion, we cannot have Federal law en-
forcement operating at cross-purposes 
with local leaders. 
In recent days, the Trump adminis-
tration has deployed Federal law en-
forcement agents in the streets of 
Portland, OR. They have arrived with-
out any visible identifying informa-
tion. These Federal agents have report-
edly used excessive force against peace-
ful protestors and detained residents in 
unmarked vehicles. Such conduct is 
unacceptable anywhere in the United 
States and certainly unacceptable in 
the city of Chicago and the State of Il-
linois. 
I am joining Senator JEFF MERKLEY 
of Oregon this week in introducing leg-
islation to prevent President Trump 
from taking this action in Chicago or 
any other American city. The bill we 
jointly are offering would require Fed-
eral officers to wear identifying insig-
nia. There is no place in America for 
secret police. 
The bill also would limit Federal 
forces to the immediate vicinity of 
Federal property unless there has been 
a written request by local leadership or 
the Insurrection Act has been invoked. 
There is no question that the Federal 
Protective Service and other Federal 
law enforcement does have the respon-
sibility for Federal facilities, but what 
we have seen in Portland has gone far 
beyond that location and into the com-
munity at large. 
Our bill would also prohibit arrests 
or apprehensions in unmarked vehicles 
and render any arrests made in viola-
tion of this act unlawful. 
How in the world can we explain that 
in the year 2020, the Trump administra-
tion would follow the example of Vladi-
mir Putin in his invasion of Ukraine 
with these so-called green monsters, 
who would arrive without any insignia 
or any indication of whom they were 
fighting for? These little green men 
turned out to be agents of the Russian 
Government. We don’t need anything 
like that—even close to it—in the 
United States. 
Finally, the bill would require notice 
to the public in the event of crowd con-
trol-related deployments that includes 
information about the agencies in-
volved, the number of personnel, and 
information related to requests and 
other details. That is what you come to 
expect in a democracy. 
In February 2017, Senator TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH
and 
I 
sent 
President 
Trump a letter suggesting how he 
could help, how the Federal Govern-
ment could come forward to give us as-
sistance in fighting crime and gun vio-
lence in the city of Chicago. The letter 
noted that public safety is primarily a

local responsibility, but the Federal 
Government can be a partner in public 
safety efforts alongside local officials, 
law 
enforcement, 
and 
community 
stakeholders. 
We recommended the administration 
take steps to assist local violence-pre-
vention efforts, including enhancing 
Department of Justice programs that 
improve community policing; directing 
the Department of Justice to promote 
mentoring and job-training programs 
for youth and the formerly incarcer-
ated; improving mentoring and vio-
lence-prevention initiatives and boost-
ing funding for recidivism-reduction 
programs; directing the Department of 
Justice to abide by its commitment to 
help implement policing reforms rec-
ommended by the Department’s Civil 
Rights Division; closing the gaps in the 
FBI gun background check system and 
in Federal firearm laws that enable 
straw purchasers and gun traffickers to 
flood Chicago’s streets with illicit 
guns; prioritizing career and youth 
training programs to address lack of 
economic opportunity; and redirecting 
resources that are devoted to the con-
struction of his border wall to making 
our cities and communities across the 
United States safer. That is the way 
the Trump administration can show 
that it really cares about law enforce-
ment in the city of Chicago and across 
this Nation and can help us move for-
ward in reducing the incidence of vio-
lence. 
I join Mayor Lightfoot in making it 
clear to President Trump that we have 
no need and will not tolerate tyranny 
by the Federal Government on the 
streets of Chicago. 
If the President truly wants to co-
operate with law enforcement efforts, 
we can find ways to find common 
ground and make it a safer city to-
gether, but sending in secret police 
with unmarked vehicles to snatch peo-
ple off the streets is not only unaccept-
able, it is un-American. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, I listened care-
fully to Senator MCCONNELL this morn-
ing as he came to the floor and talked 
about the situation we currently face. 
Make no mistake—we are still in the 
midst of this pandemic. COVID–19 is 
taking its toll on many parts of Amer-
ica. In the last week, more than 40 dif-
ferent States that decided to open their 
economies early have found that it was 
not a wise decision; that, in fact, many 
more people are becoming infected and 
dying. Over 140,000 have died in the 
United States so far, and over 3 million 
have been infected. I am afraid that 
there will be more to follow. I wish 
that were not the case. The question is, 
What can we do? 
First, what can we do when it comes 
to COVID–19? 
I listened the other day when Dr. An-
thony Fauci of the National Institutes 
of Health was interviewed, and he and 
Dr. Collins have both been asked, why 
does it take so long to get results when 
people go in for testing for COVID–19? 
Well, there is no explanation, and there 
is no good reason, and, sadly, that 
delay is causing a problem. People are 
uncertain of their status as to whether 
they are positive or otherwise for days 
on end, waiting for the results of the 
test. 
It is time for us to develop a test 
that is timely in its results and widely 
available to Americans. We cannot re-
alistically open the economy or even 
conceivably get our schools back to 
normal until we have that testing. 
Why, then, does the White House re-
sist putting money in the next COVID– 
19 bill for the additional testing that is 
fundamental to the question of dealing 
with the future of this COVID–19 virus? 
In addition, I am joining with a num-
ber of my colleagues—KIRSTEN GILLI-
BRAND, MICHAEL BENNET, CHRIS COONS, 
and others—in an effort to try to ex-
pand the medical and healthcare per-
sonnel necessary to make sure that we 
finally bring this virus to bay. We are 
going to try to include this in the 
COVID–19 legislation. 
I 
have 
legislation 
that 
Senator 
RUBIO—a Republican from Florida—and 
I have cosponsored that would enhance 
the training of National Health Service 
doctors, nurses, and dentists and med-
ical professionals, mental health coun-
selors and the like. I think our bill is a 
step forward because it provides schol-
arship assistance to those who will 
pledge years of service to the National 
Health Service Corps once they have 
graduated and are licensed. We need 
that. 
CHRIS COONS is talking about expand-
ing the opportunity for Americans to 
step forward and serve their Nation 
doing contact tracing and other things 
that are essential. It would create 
thousands and thousands of jobs across 
the United States at a time when we 
desperately need them for a cause that 
we must conquer ultimately. 
These are good things to include in 
this legislation, but there are more im-
mediate things on the economic side. 
Do you realize that this coming Sat-
urday will be the last day we will be 
sending 
out 
unemployment 
checks 
with the Federal supplement that we 
voted on on March 26 in the CARES 
Act? Yes, this week—before next Sun-
day—the last check will be mailed be-
cause, you see, our effort under the 
CARES Act expires on July 31. 
The last payment will be made on 
Saturday, and then what? And then 
what? For the millions of Americans 
who depend on this Federal supplement 
to feed their families, pay their rent, 
pay their mortgage, pay the utilities, 
pay their health insurance premiums— 
what are they going to do next? 
I listened to Senator MCCONNELL say: 
Well, we are going to have to take a 
look at what that is going to be in the 
future. Well, let’s do it, Senator, but 
let’s do it quickly. Why have we wait-
ed? It has been since March 26 that we 
have taken up any legislation on the 
subject, and we knew this day would 
come. Why did we wait until the last 
minute? 
Eight weeks ago, the House of Rep-
resentatives did their measure, the He-
roes Act—one which I think is sound 
and principled and I would have sup-
ported. Senator MCCONNELL has come 
to the floor regularly to say it is so 
bad, it is inadequate, it is wrong. Yet 
we still don’t have a proposal from the 
Republicans, who are the majority in 
the Senate, about what they would do 
to move forward from this point in the 
next COVID–19 bill. 
One of the areas that I want to ad-
dress specifically is the fact that al-
most 3 months ago—maybe longer— 
Senator MCCONNELL came to the floor 
and said: There is a redline here. If the 
COVID–19 bill that we are considering 
in the future does not include a provi-
sion giving immunity—legal immu-
nity—to businesses across the United 
States, it has no chance. We are not 
going to consider it. 
Well, many of us have a lot of ques-
tions about this legal immunity that 
Senator MCCONNELL
is asking for. 
What is it? How far does it go? Well, it 
turns out there was a memo describing 
it that was leaked to K Street. That is 
where the lobbyists’ offices are for spe-
cial interest groups in Washington. 
That memo found its way into a news-
paper, and we have read it, and there 
are still many unanswered questions. 
We have been waiting for months for 
the language—this redline immunity 
language that Senator MCCONNELL in-
sists on. He has described the number 
of lawsuits and litigation that have 
been filed under COVID–19 as being a 
tsunami, 
overwhelming 
in 
number. 
Completely 
false. 
The 
number 
of 
claims that have been filed is few 
across the United States, with more 
than 3 million people who have so far 
been infected. 
Should we have a standard of con-
duct? Of course we should. The Senate 
Judiciary Committee, almost 3 weeks 
ago, had a hearing where a Texas busi-
nessman came forward and said: I want 
to do the right thing, but what stand-
ard should I be following here? Some-
thing local? Something State? Some-
thing Federal? Give me the standard, 
and I will do my very best to live up to 
it. 
Well, that sounded like a good-faith 
effort by a businessperson who wants 
customers and employees to be safe 
when they come into his establish-
ment. He has every right to ask for 
that standard, and we have every re-
sponsibility to provide it based not on 
the politics of the moment but on pub-
lic health, on medical certainty, and on 
science. That is what the standard 
should be drawn to, and the notion that 
any standard published by anyone— 
whether by a town, a city, a township, 
a county, a State, whatever it might 
be—is sufficient to absolve any busi-
ness from any liability goes way too 
far. Unfortunately, it is going to be 
misused, I am afraid, by those who do 
not—as this businessman clearly was 
not going to do—want to live up to 
their responsibility.

S4315 
July 21, 2020 
What that Texas businessman said in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee gave 
me a good belief and strong faith that 
the business community wants to do 
the right thing but just wants guid-
ance. It would be amazing if the CDC 
and OSHA stepped forward and pro-
vided clear, enforceable standards so 
that businesses and others across the 
United States knew exactly what to do 
in terms of social distancing and masks 
and the like. We need that, but first we 
need 
the 
language 
from 
Senator 
MCCONNELL. This so-called redline has 
been promised now for months. Let’s 
see the details. Let’s move forward 
from there. 
The notion of immunity for busi-
nesses by any standard that will not 
protect employees and customers is un-
acceptable. It would not make America 
safe; it would make the situation even 
worse. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we 
have three groups of speakers having 
to do with the vote that will take place 
at 11:45 a.m., and during that time I 
will take the first 15 minutes, and then 
other Members will have amendments. 
The first two amendments will be the 
Schatz 
amendment 
and 
then 
my 
amendment. 
I did have the intention of having 
more time and was going to kind of re-
joice a little bit because, right now, I 
understand we are about to get the in-
formation on suggestions that the Sec-
retary of Defense has after working 
over a realignment of some of our re-
sources, particularly in Europe. This is 
kind of interesting because this is 
something that 18 years ago this year I 
tried to do unsuccessfully when Jim 
Jones was the Supreme Allied Com-
mander, and we were not able to get it 
done. After 18 years, we are going to 
try it again. I will be speaking about 
that issue at 4 p.m. today, and it is a 
significant one. 
Today we are considering amend-
ments to our national defense author-
ization bill. We are still working on a 
managers’ package, but as I previously 
noted, we have already agreed to more 
than 140 bipartisan amendments. 
Let me be more specific than that. 
This is the first time we have done 
this. We have had amendments to a 
lesser degree in the past. This is the 
first time that the entire bill has been 
put together by Members of the U.S. 
Senate. 
To demonstrate that, the total num-
ber of amendments to date, on July 
21—including our request prior to com-
ing to the floor—are 818 amendments, 
of which 440 are Republican and 428 are 
Democratic. Then there was the adop-
tion of the substitute amendment. We 
all remember what happened then. We 
had 79 amendments. Those amend-
ments were 34 Democrat and 34 Repub-
lican, and 11 were joint. Then the 
amendments we adopted with the man-
agers’ package included 34 amend-
ments, 15 from Republicans and 18 from 
Democrats, as amendments on the sec-
ond managers’ package numbering 28 
and the third package of 34. What I am 
saying is that we have had many 
amendments, and this is the first time 
there has been a bill that was entirely 
written by the Members. That is why 
we are at a point now where we can in-
troduce our amendments. 
It was important to both Senator 
REED and me to try to vote on at least 
a few individual amendments. This is 
something we haven’t been able to do 
in the last several years. We made this 
arrangement 2 weeks ago when we set 
up some six amendments to be voted 
on. We will start in just a few minutes 
voting on the first two, which will be 
Senator SCHATZ’s and mine. I am glad 
we are doing this within the hour. 
The first two amendments will be in 
relation to Senator SCHATZ regarding 
the 1033 Program. I am strongly op-
posed to the Schatz amendment to end 
the 1033 Program. I hear people talking 
about this, and I guess they don’t real-
ize what we have done in the State of 
Oklahoma. Our sheriffs and law en-
forcement officers were quite upset 
when they heard that it might be in 
jeopardy. The 1033 Program is an effec-
tive use of the taxpayers’ money, tak-
ing equipment that is not being used 
by the military and allowing it to go 
into the law enforcement sector. All 
kinds of precautions have already been 
taken, but we are talking about adding 
a few more precautions. 
The 1033 Program is an effective use 
of taxpayers’ money. In fact, since the 
program’s creation in 1990, more than 
$7 billion worth of vehicles, desks, 
boots, computers, and more have been 
responsibly recycled into law enforce-
ment. This is military equipment that 
the military no longer needs and that 
these agencies would be purchasing 
anyway. The equipment is always de-
militarized so that it is appropriate for 
public safety use. 
For years, local law enforcement has 
been asked to do more with less. Now 
they face the liberal cause to defund 
the police. We need to continue this 
transparent, responsive program. 
There are a lot of us who have a hard 
time believing that this is going on 
today—that people are trying to play 
down law enforcement, trying to say 
that it is acceptable to break the law. 
This has never happened before in 
America, but that is what we are see-
ing right now. That makes this pro-
gram one that is even more valuable. 
Senator SCHATZ’s amendment would 
place such stringent limitations on the 
1033 Program that it would make the 
program virtually impossible to use. It 
adds only burdensome certification and 
reporting requirements. 
Now, I don’t say this critically of 
Senator SCHATZ, but he doesn’t like the 
program, and he wants to kill the pro-
gram. We are not going to allow this to 
happen. 
As an example, let’s say that a sher-
iff’s office in my State of Oklahoma or 
any other State decides that they want 
to receive sleeping bags that the De-
partment of Defense no longer needs. 
Under the Schatz amendment, that 
sheriff’s office would need to, No. 1, put 
the request for sleeping bags out for 
public comment 30 days prior; second, 
they would have to receive approval 
from local and State authorities; and 
third, they would have to file reports 
on how the sleeping bags would be used 
and the kind of training officers will 
have to receive in order for them to 
have these sleeping bags. 
Sheriff’s offices are too busy working 
to keep our communities safe to file 
numerous reports on sleeping bags that 
they receive from DOD. To put it 
bluntly, I think this amendment would 
kill the 1033 Program. Again, this is al-
lowing trained law enforcement offi-
cers to use surplus equipment that is 
not going to be used and has no value 
to the military. This is why both the 
National Sheriffs’ Association and the 
National Fraternal Order of Police 
strongly 
oppose 
Senator 
SCHATZ’s 
amendment. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the recommendations from the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association and the Na-
tional Fraternal Order of Police. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NATIONAL SHERIFFS’ ASSOCIATION, 
Alexandria, VA, July 14, 2020. 
Hon. JAMES INHOFE, 
Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed 
Services, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I write today to lend 
the voice of 3,068 sheriffs in support of your 
amendment #2411 to the National Defense 
Authorization Act and in opposition to Sen-
ator Schatz’ amendment #2252. The National 
Sheriffs’ Association has studied this issue 
thoroughly and determine that your amend-
ment to prohibit the transfer of bayonets, 
grenades (other than flashbang and stun), 
weaponized tracked combat vehicles and 
armed drones is a more thoughtful approach. 
Senator Schatz, on the other hand, would 
stop the 1033 completely thru bureaucratic 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
that make it all but impossible to legally 
comply. It seems to us that, since taxpayers 
have bought this equipment once, to simply 
throw the equipment away or let it rust in 
warehouses is an incredibly wasteful ap-
proach to taxpayers’ dollars. The sheriffs im-
plore you to let us continue to use this 
equipment to save lives in high water res-
cues, deep snow rescues, and hostage situa-
tions, which we do many times a year. 
Best regards, 
JONATHAN THOMPSON, 
Executive Director and CEO.

July 21, 2020 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, 
Washington, DC, July 15, 2020. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATORS MCCONNELL AND SCHUMER: 
I am writing on behalf of the members of the 
Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of 
our opposition to S. Amdt. 2252, which will 
be offered to S. 4049, the ‘‘National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.’’ The 
FOP urges members of the Senate to vote 
against this amendment, which would im-
pose sweeping restrictions on an important 
surplus equipment program for State and 
local law enforcement agencies. 
The FOP has long supported the 1033 pro-
gram, which is a surplus equipment program 
administered by the Defense Logistics Agen-
cies (DLA) and the Law Enforcement Sup-
port Office (LESO) at the U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD). The media is constructing an 
inaccurate narrative that State and local 
law enforcement agencies are becoming too 
‘‘militarized’’ simply because this program is 
administered by the DoD. 
It is important for Senators to understand 
that equipment received through the 1033 
program is demilitarized and repurposed for 
public safety use. Simply because a piece of 
equipment was originally purchased—with 
our tax dollars—by the DoD does not make it 
military equipment. A tool is defined by its 
use. The equipment is used to defend and 
protect officers and civilians from threats 
and to carry out law enforcement and public 
safety objectives. 
There is no data, studies, or other informa-
tion to support the contention that State 
and local law enforcement agencies are mis-
using equipment obtained through these 
Federal grant programs. For this reason, on 
behalf of the more than 354,000 members of 
the Fraternal Order of Police, we urge mem-
bers of the Senate to vote against this 
amendment. If I can provide any additional 
information on this issue, please feel free to 
contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco 
in my Washington office. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICK YOES, 
National President. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
support strong oversight of the 1033 
Program, and I understand the intent 
behind my colleague’s amendment. We 
want to make sure that the wrong kind 
of equipment doesn’t get into the 
hands of people who cannot properly 
use it, so we have actually put those 
modifications into an amendment that 
will be voted on—the Inhofe amend-
ment—right after the Schatz amend-
ment, in another 30 minutes from now. 
We are offering an alternative to the 
Schatz amendment. It would place a 
more narrow limitation on the transfer 
of Department of Defense equipment, 
including weapons that cannot be used 
by State and local enforcement. We are 
talking 
about 
weapons 
such 
as 
weaponized tracking vehicles, drones, 
and lethal grenades. They are not being 
used anyway, so let’s put them on a list 
so that they can’t be used. That should 
satisfy a lot of people’s concerns. 
It also makes sure that those who re-
ceive this equipment get necessary 
training on how to protect citizens’ 
constitutional 
rights 
and 
enhanced 
training on deescalation techniques. 
Defunding and deequipping our law 
enforcement agencies simply will not 
fix anything. Making sure they have 
the right equipment and right training 
will. So I would request that my col-
leagues vote no on the Schatz amend-
ment and recognize the value of this 
program, and vote yes on my amend-
ment putting new safeguards into the 
1033 Program. 
With that, Madam President, having 
used the first 10 minutes of my time, I 
yield the next 5 minutes to Senator 
CRAMER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
thank Chairman INHOFE for his leader-
ship and eloquence. I rise today in de-
fense of the heroes on the thin blue line 
and in opposition to amendment No. 
2252 to the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, which Chairman INHOFE just 
spoke to. 
Over the past few months, America 
has watched as we have seen a rise in 
civil unrest turn into violence in cities 
all across our country. Anarchists and 
domestic terrorists have exploited the 
peaceful protests of millions of well-in-
tentioned Americans in order to inflict 
chaos and instill fear in our commu-
nities. Standing on the frontlines as a 
shield from absolute anarchy are our 
local law enforcement officers who, by 
and large, have applied the appropriate 
force required to protect American 
families as well as First Amendment 
rights. 
Unfortunately, some have made the 
political calculation that they would 
benefit more from chaos than from 
peace. They believe defunding and 
abolishing police departments and re-
stricting their access to protective 
gear are politically better than an hon-
est look at what our justice system 
really needs to succeed. 
The 1033 Program has been utilized 
for years to provide State and local law 
enforcement with valuable tools al-
ready purchased by the Federal Gov-
ernment to promote public safety. It 
would be the epitome of waste to gut 
this program and let these valuable 
tools rust in a pile or a closet some-
place. 
As the chairman stated, the police 
and sheriffs associations oppose amend-
ment No. 2252, and for good reason. 
Patrick Yoes of the Fraternal Order of 
Police says: 
It is important for Senators to understand 
that equipment received through the 1033 
program is demilitarized and repurposed for 
public safety use. Simply because a piece of 
equipment was originally purchased with our 
tax dollars by the Department of Defense 
does not make it military equipment. A tool 
is defined by its use. The equipment is used 
to defend and protect officers and civilians 
from threats and to carry out law enforce-
ment and public safety objectives. 
It is stunning to me that some of my 
colleagues are more appalled at where 
law enforcement gets some of their 
tools and equipment than they are at 
the violence that our police officers 
have to endure every day. The amend-
ment offered today would bury law en-
forcement, especially those from poor 
communities, in unnecessary bureauc-
racy, effectively preventing them from 
procuring the equipment needed to 
keep our communities and citizens 
safe. This unworkable messaging ploy 
is born out of Democrats’ belief that 
vilifying the police will somehow help 
them win the election in November. 
Thankfully, there is an alternative, 
amendment No. 2411, offered by the 
chairman from Oklahoma. It is a 
thoughtful, 
commonsense 
approach 
with a focus on trained prevention and 
deescalation. It puts the right equip-
ment in the right hands and places 
commonsense 
restrictions 
on 
what 
transfers can occur, all while saving 
the taxpayers’ money. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
amendment No. 2411 and call on the 
Members of this body to reject any at-
tempts to prevent these brave men and 
women from doing their jobs to safely 
secure our communities. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2252 TO AMENDMENT NO. 2301 
(Purpose: To reform Department of 
Defense transfers of personal property 
to law enforcement agencies.) 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I 
call up amendment No. 2252, as pro-
vided for under the previous order. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. SCHATZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 2252 to 
amendment No. 2301. 
Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous con-
sent to dispense with the reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, Sen-
ators MURKOWSKI, HARRIS, PAUL, and I 
are offering a bipartisan amendment 
that proposes reasonable, common-
sense reforms to the 1033 Program. 
Groups on the left and the right sup-
port it, including the NAACP, the Na-
tional 
Urban 
League, 
OurStreets, 
FreedomWorks, 
Concerned 
Veterans 
for America, the American Conserv-
ative Union, Campaign for Liberty, 
Americans for Tax Reform, and the 
Faith and Freedom Coalition. 
People on the left and the right agree 
that it is time to start to demilitarize 
the police. 
Our amendment will permanently 
prohibit the transfer of lethal military 
weapons to police departments. This 
includes heavy ammunition, bayonets, 
grenade 
launchers, 
explosives, 
stripped-down tanks, tear gas, and 
weaponized 
drones, 
among 
other 
things. Now, think about that list— 
weaponized drones and bayonets. Is 
anybody under the impression that a 
police department needs a weaponized 
drone or a bayonet? 
Our amendment also ensures the po-
lice departments can still get access to

the equipment that actually helps 
them to protect the public under the 
1033 Program, like first-aid kits, cold- 
weather gear, flash lights, and high- 
water vehicles to respond to flood dis-
asters. 
The last month has made clear that 
weapons of war don’t belong in police 
departments. Weapons of war have no 
place in police departments. We saw 
the terrifying images of police in mili-
tary gear storming the streets, combat 
vehicles rumbling down city blocks, 
rounds and rounds of tear gas shot at 
peaceful protesters, frequently without 
warning and often unprovoked. None of 
this helps anyone deescalate a crisis. 
Our communities are not battlefields. 
The American people are not enemy 
combatants. If our troops can’t use 
tear gas while overseas, police depart-
ments shouldn’t use it on American 
citizens. It is really that simple. 
Across the country, more than 8,000 
police 
departments 
are 
stockpiling 
weapons of war at no cost. The re-
search plainly shows that outfitting 
our police for war does not help to keep 
the peace. Militarized equipment actu-
ally leads to more violence, dispropor-
tionately impacting communities of 
color. More militarized law enforce-
ment is associated with more civilians 
killed each year by police. 
One study found that when a county 
goes from having no military equip-
ment to receiving about $2.5 million 
worth of weaponry, civilian deaths at 
the hands of police are likely to double. 
To make matters worse, some police 
departments are misusing this program 
by selling, trading, or pawning equip-
ment. Often, county and city officials 
don’t even know what weapons and 
equipment police departments are ac-
quiring because equipment like ar-
mored track vehicles are very expen-
sive to store and maintain. This pro-
gram is actually blowing up local budg-
ets across the country because these 
tanks are tearing up the streets. 
Today, we have an opportunity to fix 
it. It is not to repeal the 1033 Program 
outright, which, frankly, I would favor, 
but this amendment is the result of a 
bipartisan 
compromise 
wherein 
we 
worked with each Member who was 
willing to engage—former Governors 
who served in the Senate, former pros-
ecutors who served in the Senate, 
Members of both parties—and they spe-
cifically came to our office and said: 
You know, that specific item has an 
important civilian use, could you ex-
empt it from the list of prohibited 
transfers? We worked and we worked 
and we worked, and this is the com-
promise 
measure. 
By 
passing 
this 
amendment, we can prevent the abuse 
of a 1033 Program, and we can limit the 
amount of dangerous weapons in local 
precincts. 
To be clear, reforming this program 
is not the only thing we need to do. No 
single amendment will end police bru-
tality and violence, and alleviating the 
deep mistrust between police and the 
communities they are sworn to protect 
is not easy work, and it will not be 
solved by one vote. This amendment is 
meaningful, and it is bipartisan. 
There is simply no evidence to sup-
port 
the 
idea 
that 
police 
are 
outgunned. Criminals are not rolling 
around with IEDs and armored vehi-
cles. This is an opportunity, given the 
failure of us to do anything about the 
relationship between police and com-
munities—anything at all in this Con-
gress, in this historic moment—this 
amendment is an opportunity to actu-
ally get something done. We have bi-
partisan cosponsors. This will be a bi-
partisan vote. We have organizations, 
frankly, on the far left and the far 
right supporting this amendment. This 
is an opportunity for the Senate to ac-
tually get something done. So I urge 
my colleagues to vote yes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the words of the distinguished 
Senator from Hawaii. Those of us who 
served in law enforcement know the 
temptation to seek out this kind of 
military hardware and the basic use-
lessness and cost of it when that is 
done. 
I will just be very brief in mentioning 
that we had a small, very safe, and 
very quiet community. The police chief 
was in my office when I was State’s at-
torney, and the chief law enforcement 
officer of the county was all excited be-
cause he was going to get an armored 
personnel carrier. I said: What are you 
going to do with it? 
Well, just in case there is an upris-
ing. 
I said: An uprising is whether some-
body is shouting too much on your 
Fourth of July parades. I said: If you 
get that, I can assure you that if it is 
used, I will have an inquiry into why it 
was used, and no cases from your juris-
diction will be allowed in the court. He 
decided he could find better uses of 
their other things. 
I said: Besides, you are going to get 
laughed out of town if you get it. 
CORONAVIRUS 
I have spoken many times about the 
need for another COVID–19 supple-
mental. We see the frightening trajec-
tory of this virus. The terrible human 
suffering, loss, and economic devasta-
tion that is causing families, busi-
nesses, and public services in every 
State and municipality in this country 
have greatly accentuated the urgency 
of that need. 
As the coronavirus continues to out-
pace the White House’s appallingly be-
lated, I would say, incompetent, inad-
equate, and incoherent efforts to con-
tain it, and while they keep trying to 
make a sound bite, the number of 
Americans becoming sick and dying 
continues to rise. 
They ought to be worried, first and 
foremost, about Americans and Ameri-
cans’ health and Americans’ safety far 
more than what might be a political 
sound bite for this fall’s election. I re-
mind those who are running this fall, if 
you want to make sound bites about 
this and not do anything, as of yester-
day, the virus has infected more than 
3.8 million Americans. It has killed 
more than 143,000. Those are not num-
bers. Those are people. There have been 
30,000 more Americans who have been 
killed by this virus in the past 5 
months than died in Vietnam, Korea, 
Iraq, and Afghanistan combined. 
What is the President’s response? 
Well, the virus will soon just go away. 
After dismissing the virus as nothing 
to worry about and predicting that the 
U.S. economy would come roaring back 
in June, our self-proclaimed wartime 
President has, for all intents and pur-
poses, left the battlefield. 
Unfortunately, the people who are 
fighting COVID have not left the bat-
tlefield. These are friends of mine. I 
have known people who have died from 
this. We all do. Hopefully, we all know 
doctors and nurses and others who 
work on the frontlines of this. 
After months of the President belit-
tling those who wear masks to protect 
themselves and others, almost nothing 
he has said about this pandemic has 
turned out to be accurate or, worse yet, 
helpful. At this point, his priority ap-
pears to be keeping the Confederate 
flag flying and honoring those who 
fought to defend slavery and destroy 
the Union. This is appalling, even for 
this divisive President who wants to 
protect the names of people who are 
traitors to the United States and 
fought against the United States. Why 
not put names of people on those forts 
and those military bases who actually 
defended the United States and fought 
for us? 
Back to COVID–19. We know the 
virus toll in this country is staggering, 
and unlike many countries where gov-
ernments quickly put in place effective 
controls, and the virus has receded in 
those countries that put the controls 
in and their economies have largely re-
opened, here, it is getting worse. 
We also need to be aware of what the 
virus is doing in other parts of the 
world because that will determine how 
long it is going to take to defeat this 
pandemic and how long before life re-
turns to normal in our own country. 
Any virus is only an airplane trip away 
from our shores, but that has been ig-
nored by the White House. 
Last week, the World Health Organi-
zation, which the White House blames 
for favoring China—at the same time, 
incidentally, 
President 
Trump 
was 
praising Xi Jinping for China’s re-
sponse to the virus—reported more 
than 14 million confirmed infections 
and more than 600,000 deaths world-
wide. The virus has spread to 216 coun-
tries and territories. It affected the en-
tire world. Countries with the most ad-
vanced healthcare systems in the world 
are struggling to cope with the flood of 
sick people. As bad as that is, the situ-
ation is far worse in developing coun-
tries, where billions of people have no 
access to quality medical services, and,

for that matter, even safe water and 
sanitation. 
Their governments have minimal 
ability to stop the spread of the virus 
or to shore up their failing economies 
and to stop the virus from going else-
where. Without aid from the United 
States and other donors, the virus 
spreads out of control. You know, we 
are not isolated from the rest of the 
world. We have already seen this hap-
pening in our hemisphere. 
According to USAID; the World Food 
Programme; 
the 
Vaccine 
Alliance, 
GAVI; the Global Fund; and other pub-
lic health and humanitarian organiza-
tions, COVID-related needs around the 
world are spiking in every area. USAID 
said that whatever amount of resources 
the Congress provides is not going to 
be enough. 
They describe massive gaps in meet-
ing what they foresee as a tidal wave of 
need in the making, at the same time 
that they and others are trying to stop 
the backsliding in other infectious dis-
ease programs, which, because we are 
all on one globe, ultimately affect us. 
If the current trend continues, 270 
million people will be without ade-
quate food by the end of this year, an 
increase of 150 million due to the pan-
demic alone. U.S. Food for Peace Pro-
gram, known as P.L. 480 Title II, has 
been a lifesaver for over 60 years. More 
than 3 billion people in 150 countries 
have received P.L. 480 food aid, and it 
has been backed strongly by both Re-
publicans and Democrats in this body. 
It is absolutely vital to the COVID–19 
response. 
The World Food Programme is under-
taking the biggest humanitarian re-
sponse in its history. Does that affect 
us in the United States? Of course, it 
does because we are interrelated, and 
because if these problems continue in 
other parts of the world, ultimately, 
they do affect us very, very much. 
In the United States, we see that our 
agriculture economy is continuing to 
suffer. The Trump trade wars have hurt 
our farmers. The pandemic has acceler-
ated their decline. Actually, additional 
funding for P.L. 480 will help address 
immediate global hunger needs, while 
it would also support America’s farm 
community suffering from the eco-
nomic crisis caused by COVID–19. 
The U.N. believes the number of 
COVID–19 
infections 
are 
massively 
underreported and is running out of 
funds to support the hundreds of pas-
sengers and cargo flights carrying 
international aid and workers’ food and 
medical supplies, and, of course, many 
of these humanitarian workers are 
themselves becoming ill. 
Both USAID and the U.N. have stated 
that you have to have U.S. leadership 
to get other countries to help. It is a 
practice widely understood, apparently 
everywhere except at the White House. 
The less prepared we and other coun-
tries are for what lies ahead, the worse 
it is going to be for them and for us. 
You know, this is not just being good 
humanitarians on our part; we have an 
interest in this, too—in the world being 
healthy. It is not a problem that is 
going to be solved by an ‘‘America 
First’’ policy or by building a wall and 
saying somebody else will pay for it or 
by blaming others. 
Americans can’t safely resume nor-
mal international travel and commerce 
without a successful global strategy to 
reduce the number and rate of infec-
tions. As long as the virus is spreading 
in this hemisphere and beyond, Ameri-
cans will continue to become infected 
and die, and the U.S. economy will suf-
fer, no matter how many tweets and 
sound bites come from the White 
House. 
The amount appropriated for the 
international response to the virus in 
previous COVID–19 supplementals to-
tals $2.4 billion, including less than $1 
billion for food and other humanitarian 
aid. That is about one-half of 1 percent 
of the sum total of those emergency 
supplementals. 
I will put much of these numbers in 
the RECORD, but there are billions 
needed for the cost of purchasing and 
distributing billions of doses of a 
coronavirus vaccine, as soon as one is 
available. GAVI will play an essential 
role in that, protecting the world and 
protecting us because that distribution 
is going to be immensely difficult and 
costly, and we have to be prepared as 
soon as the vaccine is proven to be safe 
and effective. 
The longer Congress delays, then the 
more costly—in lives and dollars—an 
effective 
international 
response 
to 
COVID–19 becomes. 
The President does not want to be 
the leader we need at this critical time. 
So it is up to Congress—an independent 
branch 
of 
government—to 
actually 
stand up and do our work. 
On July 10, the House Appropriations 
Committee marked up its fiscal year 
2021 bill for the Department of State 
and Foreign Operations, which includes 
$10 million in emergency funding to re-
spond to COVID–19. That is a good 
start, but we have a lot more to do. I 
hope the proposal that will finally be 
unveiled by the majority leader will in-
clude funds for an international re-
sponse. 
Senator GRAHAM—a Republican—and 
I have worked together on this Foreign 
Ops bill. We are in agreement that we 
need strong U.S. leadership at this crit-
ical time. I am going to be making rec-
ommendations to other members of the 
Appropriations Committee on this. 
I will close on an entirely different 
matter. 
When I see a Navy veteran come and 
ask masked, unidentified soldiers, po-
lice officers—nobody really said who 
they were—dispersing a crowd in Port-
land, and he just stands there and says: 
Look, who are you? What are you 
doing? He was not being in any way 
threatening. What is their response to 
him? They start beating him and beat-
ing him and firing tear gas at him. He 
simply asked: Who are you? Why are 
you in our town? What are you doing? 
Will you please tell me who you are. 
They start beating him, and they break 
his hand. This is a Navy veteran who 
has served our country. 
This is as out of control as anything 
else. And to hear smug comments from 
members of the administration saying 
that we have to do this—no, everybody 
knows they are doing that hoping that 
somehow it will help the President’s 
reelection. 
I want to help the United States of 
America. 
I have spoken many times about the 
need for another COVID–19 supple-
mental. The frightening trajectory of 
this virus and the terrible human suf-
fering, loss, and economic devastation 
it is causing families, businesses, and 
public services in every State and mu-
nicipality in this country, have greatly 
accentuated the urgency of that need. 
As the coronavirus continues to out-
pace the White House’s appallingly be-
lated, incompetent, inadequate, and in-
coherent efforts to contain it, the num-
ber of Americans becoming sick and 
dying continues to rise. 
As of yesterday, the virus has in-
fected more than 3.8 million Americans 
and has killed more than 143,000. 
Those are not numbers. They are peo-
ple. Thirty thousand more Americans 
have been killed by this virus in the 
past 5 months than died in Vietnam, 
Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan com-
bined. 
The President’s response? That the 
virus will ‘‘soon just go away’’. After 
dismissing the virus as nothing to 
worry about and predicting that the 
U.S. economy would come ‘‘roaring 
back’’ in June, our self-proclaimed 
‘‘war time President’’ has for all in-
tents and purposes left the battlefield. 
After months of belittling those who 
wear masks to protect themselves and 
others, almost nothing he has said 
about this pandemic has turned out to 
be accurate or helpful. 
At this point, his priority appears to 
be keeping the confederate flag flying 
and honoring those who fought to de-
fend slavery and destroy the Union. 
That is appalling, even for this divisive 
President. 
The virus’s toll in this country is 
staggering, and unlike many countries 
where governments quickly put in 
place effective controls and the virus 
has receded and economies have large-
ly reopened, here it is getting worse. 
But we also need to be aware of what 
the virus is doing in other parts of the 
world because that will determine how 
long it will take to defeat this pan-
demic and how long before life returns 
to normal in our own country. This, 
too, has been all but ignored by the 
White House. 
Last week, the World Health Organi-
zation—which the White House blames 
for favoring China at the same time 
President 
Trump 
was 
praising 
Xi 
Jinping for China’s response to the 
virus—reported more than 14 million 
confirmed infections and more than 
600,000 deaths worldwide. The virus has

spread to 216 countries and terri-
tories—in effect, the entire world. 
Countries with the most advanced 
health care systems in the world are 
struggling to cope with the flood of 
sick people. As bad as that is, the situ-
ation is far worse in developing coun-
tries, where billions of people have no 
access to quality medical services or 
even safe water and sanitation. 
Their governments have minimal 
ability to stop the spread of the virus 
or to shore up their failing economies. 
Without aid from the United States 
and other donors, the virus will spread 
out of control. In fact, that is already 
happening in this hemisphere. 
According to USAID, the World Food 
Programme, WFP; The Vaccine Alli-
ance, GAVI; the Global Fund; and 
other public health and humanitarian 
organizations, 
COVID-related 
needs 
around the world are spiking ‘‘in every 
area’’ and USAID says that whatever 
amount of resources the Congress pro-
vides ‘‘will not be enough.’’ 
They describe ‘‘massive gaps’’ in 
meeting what they fore see as a ‘‘tidal 
wave of need’’ in the making, at the 
same time that they and others are 
trying to stop the backsliding in other 
infectious disease programs. 
According to WFP, if current trends 
continue, 270 million people will be 
without adequate food by the end of 
this year, an increase of 150 million due 
to the pandemic alone. 
The U.S. Food for Peace Program, 
known as P.L. 480—Title II, has been a 
life-saver for over 60 years. More than 
three billion people in 150 countries 
have received P.L. 480 food aid. 
This program is absolutely vital to 
the COVID–19 response. As countries 
restrict international travel to slow 
the spread of the virus, it is disrupting 
the transport and movement of food. 
WFP is undertaking the biggest hu-
manitarian response in its history. Ac-
cording to David Beasley, ‘‘[t]his un-
precedented crisis requires an unprece-
dented response. If we do not respond 
rapidly and effectively to this viral 
threat, the outcome will be measured 
in an unconscionable loss of life, and 
efforts to roll back the tide of hunger 
will be undone.’’ 
In the United States, the agriculture 
economy is continuing to suffer. Not 
only have the Trump trade wars hurt 
our farmers, the pandemic has acceler-
ated their decline. Additional funding 
for P.L. 480 would help address imme-
diate global hunger needs, while also 
supporting America’s farm community 
suffering from the economic crisis 
caused by COVID–19. 
The United Nations believes the 
number 
of 
COVID–19 
infections 
is 
‘‘massively 
under-reported,’’ 
and 
is 
running out of funds to support the 
hundreds of passenger and cargo flights 
carrying international aid workers, 
food, and medical supplies. Their ef-
forts are also threatened by the fact 
that many health and humanitarian 
workers are getting sick. 
All of this requires large infusions of 
money, and USAID and the U.N. both 
say that U.S. leadership is crucial to 
obtaining contributions from other do-
nors. It is widely understood—at least 
everywhere except inside the White 
House—that the less prepared we and 
other countries are for what lies ahead 
the worse it will be for them and for us. 
This is not a problem that will be 
solved by an ‘‘America First’’ policy or 
by building a wall or by blaming oth-
ers. 
Americans cannot safely resume nor-
mal international travel and commerce 
without a successful global strategy to 
sustainably reduce the number and 
rate of infections. As long as the virus 
is spreading in this hemisphere and be-
yond, Americans will continue to be-
come infected and die and the U.S. 
economy will suffer. 
The amount appropriated for the 
international response to the virus in 
previous COVID–19 supplementals to-
tals $2.4 billion, including less than $1 
billion for food and other humanitarian 
aid. That is less than one-half of 1 per-
cent of the sum total of those emer-
gency supplementals. 
Today’s appeals from just the Global 
Fund, WFP, and GAVI total $10 billion, 
and that doesn’t include the needs of 
agencies like the UN High Commis-
sioner for Refugees, UNICEF, or our 
own programs administered by USAID 
and the State Department. 
Several billion dollars are needed 
just for the cost of purchasing and dis-
tributing 
billions 
of 
doses 
of 
a 
coronavirus vaccine as soon as one is 
available, in which GAVI will play a 
central role. The distribution will be 
immensely difficult and costly, and we 
have to be prepared as soon as a vac-
cine is proven to be safe and effective. 
The longer Congress delays, the more 
costly—in lives and dollars—an effec-
tive international response to COVID– 
19 becomes. Controlling the outbreak 
here at home is ultimately a lost cause 
if we do not act aggressively to assist 
other countries in the global fight 
against this pandemic. 
President Trump has shown that he 
cannot and will not be the leader we 
need at this critical time. It is up to 
Congress. The longer we delay, the 
more difficult and costly it will be to 
defeat this virus. 
On July 10, the House Appropriations 
Committee marked up its fiscal year 
2021 bill for the Department of State 
and Foreign Operations, which includes 
$10 billion in emergency funding for the 
international response to COVID–19. 
That is a good start, but it is too little. 
The virus is racing around the world 
and the costs of stopping it are increas-
ing every day. 
I hope the proposal about to be un-
veiled by the majority leader includes 
the necessary funds for the inter-
national response because, to repeat, 
controlling the outbreak here at home 
is ultimately a lost cause if we do not 
act aggressively to assist other coun-
tries against this pandemic. 
I believe Senator GRAHAM and I are 
in agreement about the need for strong 
U.S. leadership at this critical time. I 
will be making my own recommenda-
tion to the other members of the Ap-
propriations Committee for the nec-
essary funding to combat the virus 
overseas, and I urge other Senators to 
support it. 
S. 4049 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, there is a 
Cold War-era quote, attributed to Win-
ston Churchill, that ‘‘in a democracy, a 
knock on the door in the early morning 
is the milkman.’’ 
In the United States, we are not sup-
posed to fear a knock on our front 
door. If the police do knock on our 
door, we expect them to come at a rea-
sonable hour and to respond to crimi-
nal activity with the professionalism 
befitting the peace officers they are. 
Those are the expectations of a free 
people, proud of its history and tradi-
tion of separating the roles between ci-
vilian law enforcement agencies and 
the Armed Forces—one is to keep the 
peace within its community, the other 
is to destroy foreign adversaries. 
By keeping those roles separate, 
Americans have historically built and 
sustained a strong bond of trust with 
their police officers. But, for years, the 
war on crime and the misguided war on 
drugs has looked a lot like the war on 
terror. 
Throughout our country, due to the 
Department of Defense’s 1033 Program, 
law enforcement is equipped with the 
tools of the U.S. military, which has 
predictably resulted in the continued 
decline of the relationship between the 
police and those they serve. 
Perhaps we should discuss the kinds 
of machinery provided to local police 
departments. 
The 1033 Program provided to the 
sleepy New England town of Keene, 
NH, a Ballistic Engineered Armored 
Response Counter Attack Truck, other-
wise known as a Bearcat. 
That might sound menacing, but it is 
nothing compared to what the Depart-
ment of Defense provided to Columbia, 
SC: 
a 
mine-resistant 
war 
truck, 
equipped with a machine gun. 
These examples are by no means 
unique. Between 2006 and 2014, the De-
partment of Defense transferred over 
$1.5 billion worth of equipment, includ-
ing over 600 mine-resistant ambush 
protected vehicles, 79,288 assault rifles, 
205 grenade launchers, and 11,959 bayo-
nets to civilian police departments. 
These are not the tools of peace offi-
cers. These are weapons uniquely de-
signed to crush an enemy army. 
Mr. President, there has emerged a 
consensus that we have turned our 
back on our own principles and blurred 
the lines between civilian law enforce-
ment and soldiers of war. 
And we know that because the Inhofe 
amendment concedes as much. By lim-
iting the types of weapons that can be 
transferred, such as bayonets and gre-
nades, the Inhofe amendment acknowl-
edges that there are at least some mili-
tary-grade weapons that should not be 
turned on the streets of America’s 
communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4320 
July 21, 2020 
But, despite that major and very wel-
come concession, the Inhofe amend-
ment contains a very telling blind spot. 
It focuses almost exclusively on weap-
onry and not the true issue here, the 
importance of trust between law en-
forcement and the communities they 
serve. 
The Inhofe amendment takes as a 
given that the transfers of military 
surplus equipment are between the law 
enforcement agencies, the DOD, and no 
one else. 
The Schatz-Paul amendment takes a 
different approach by ensuring that 
communities are notified of requests 
and 
transfers, 
by 
posting 
notices 
throughout the community and on a 
public website, as well as community 
participation by ensuring that a juris-
diction’s governing body approves of 
the transfers. And the Schatz-Paul 
amendment 
provides 
enforcement 
mechanisms to combat police mili-
tarization. 
Mr. President, the police have a very 
difficult job and serve a critical func-
tion. Without the rule of law, a civ-
ilized society cannot exist. We cannot 
take the police for granted. They are 
brave citizens, and they deserve our 
gratitude. 
That is the core of the Schatz-Paul 
amendment. Our amendment takes se-
riously the idea that the cops on the 
beat can only do their job well when 
they are well known to their neighbors 
and trusted by their communities. 
By providing the Federal Govern-
ment and local citizens a role in evalu-
ating what tools should be available to 
civilian police forces, the Schatz-Paul 
amendment will help build the rela-
tionship 
between 
law 
enforcement, 
their communities, and, in turn, make 
our citizens, our police, and our neigh-
borhoods safer. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
the Schatz-Paul amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
today in support of the Schatz amend-
ment. The Schatz amendment would 
make changes to one of the Defense De-
partment’s surplus property programs, 
known as the 1033 Program, which al-
lows the Defense Department to dis-
perse excess military equipment to 
Federal, State, and local law enforce-
ment agencies. 
The 1033 Program has provided the 
Defense Department a way to reuse 
taxpayer-funded 
equipment 
it 
no 
longer needs by providing it to law en-
forcement agencies. This, in turn, 
saves State and local governments 
from having to buy new equipment. 
This program is almost 25 years old, 
and it has been the subject of contin-
ued scrutiny and modifications. 
I would first like to review what is in 
place. DOD requires that all requests 
for equipment from law enforcement 
agencies include a justification of how 
the property will be used. This jus-
tification is a key factor in deter-
mining if a requisition is to be ap-
proved. 
Next, according to the Defense De-
partment, 92 percent of the equipment 
transferred during fiscal year 2019 was 
in the category of uncontrolled prop-
erty—things 
like 
office 
equipment, 
first aid kits, hand tools, computers, 
and digital cameras. After 1 year from 
transfer, items in this category become 
the property of the law enforcement 
agency and are no longer subject to an-
nual inventory requirements. The rest 
of the property transferred under the 
1033 Program is considered controlled 
property and is given to law enforce-
ment agencies on a conditional or 
‘‘loan’’ basis. This includes things like 
small arms, demilitarized vehicles, and 
night vision equipment. 
Typically, small arms weapons only 
make up about 5 percent of the prop-
erty transferred in the 1033 Program. 
When a law enforcement agency no 
longer wants or needs this controlled 
property, it must be returned to the 
Department of Defense. 
To ensure that this program is run 
responsibly and effectively, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office has pro-
vided several reviews of this program 
that have been helpful in past years to 
tighten the requirements on partici-
pants in the 1033 Program. The com-
mittee report accompanying the bill 
before us requires another GAO review 
of DOD’s disposal of military vehicles, 
which could inform additional reforms 
when we receive the results of the re-
view. 
I also know that the Defense Logis-
tics Agency requires annual audits of 
participating agencies to ensure they 
are accountable for the equipment they 
have received. If an agency is delin-
quent or doesn’t meet the require-
ments, then they can be suspended or 
terminated from the 1033 Program. 
While this Program is an effective 
way of reusing equipment that tax-
payers have already paid for, we con-
tinually need to ensure that our civil-
ian law enforcement agencies do not 
end up looking like or acting like our 
military when they patrol the streets. 
Given some of the incidents that have 
occurred in recent months, I believe 
that additional modifications are nec-
essary. 
The Schatz amendment adds some 
reasonable requirements and limita-
tions to the 1033 Program. For one 
thing, it would codify the prohibition 
of certain items from being transferred 
under the 1033 Program, things like 
certain kinds of ammunition, grenades, 
and drones. This amendment would 
also prohibit the use of transferred 
equipment against First Amendment- 
protected activities, such as the right 
to peaceably assemble and to petition 
the government for redress of griev-
ances. 
I know that the Defense Department 
has some concerns about how this 
amendment would be implemented, but 
I believe these concerns can be ad-
dressed during conference with the 
House. I believe it is important and 
timely to make such changes to the 
1033 Program today. 
I support the Schatz amendment and 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
it. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I come 
to the floor today to urge my col-
leagues to support amendment No. 
2411, offered by the Senator from Okla-
homa, and oppose amendment No. 2252, 
offered by the Senator from Hawaii. 
I have heard from law enforcement in 
my State. They use this program to get 
critical search-and-rescue equipment 
that saves lives. In Sweetwater Coun-
ty, the sheriff used equipment from the 
1033 Program to rescue 22 people in just 
5 months. In Big Horn County, equip-
ment from the program rescued a fam-
ily who was kayaking when 6-feet 
waves arose. A boat from this program 
was the only equipment that could 
break through the waves to rescue the 
family. Without the 1033 Program, they 
would not be able to afford this life-
saving equipment. 
Sometimes the equipment is not 
used, in which case we are pleased that 
there is no need for a search and rescue 
that year, or some of it is converted to 
fire protection equipment. 
The burdensome paperwork required 
by the amendment offered by the Sen-
ator from Hawaii would effectively end 
access to the program for the local law 
enforcement in my State whose depart-
ments are small. Our towns are small. 
The activities have to be combined be-
tween fire and police protection. 
Senator INHOFE has attempted to find 
the middle ground. His amendment re-
quires reforms and training without an 
egregious paperwork burden that could 
end this important program. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to vote 
in favor of amendment 2411 offered by 
Senator INHOFE. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, just 
by way of rebuttal to the Senator from 
Wyoming, to make clear what the 
Schatz-Murkowski-Harris-Paul amend-
ment does, we were very thoughtful 
and deliberative and collaborative with 
Members of the Senate to ensure that 
the problem he is describing would not 
occur under this new statute. So let me 
just 
be 
specific. 
Search-and-rescue 
equipment, boats, things like that 
which clearly have a virtuous civilian 
use are not prohibited transfers under 
my amendment. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2252 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
BUDGET 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss our Federal finances 
and 
the 
need 
to 
address 
our 
unsustainable fiscal debt and deficit. 
The Federal budget has already been 
on 
an 
unsustainable 
path 
before 
COVID–19 reached our shores and be-
fore the pandemic and our govern-
ment’s response to it, which has accel-
erated what I believe is a coming day 
of reckoning. 
I recognize the unprecedented crisis 
presented by COVID–19. I support the 
necessary response. Together, Congress 
has passed and the President has 
signed five separate pieces of legisla-
tion responding to the pandemic and 
its economic fallout that together will 
cost more than $2 trillion. 
I never would have supported tril-
lions in new spending unless I truly be-
lieved that it was necessary to combat 
the virus and prevent economic catas-
trophe resulting from the government 
shuttering the economy. I know many 
of my colleagues feel that same way. 
When this crisis abates—and it will— 
the Federal Government cannot afford 
to 
return 
to 
the 
status 
quo 
of 
unsustainable budgets and surging debt 
that jeopardizes the prosperity of fu-
ture generations. We have to start seri-
ous conversation about how we are 
going to pay our bills and put our fi-
nances on a more sustainable path. We 
can justify aggressive borrowing and 
spending as necessary during times of 
crisis, but that can’t be the default. 
So far this fiscal year, we have al-
ready run up a deficit of $2.7 trillion in 
1 year, more than triple the size of the 
deficit we ran at the same time last 
year. The Congressional Budget Office 
says that we are on track to spend $3.7 
trillion more than we take in this year, 
and that is assuming we don’t pass new 
COVID legislation. By the end of the 
fiscal year, our publicly held debt will 
exceed the size of our economy and, by 
the end of next year, debt as a percent-
age of the economy will be higher than 
it has ever been in our history. I have 
a little chart here that demonstrates 
that. 
We have been fortunate the interest 
rates on our debt are currently low, 
and the government has been able to 
borrow the funds necessary to address 
the crisis caused by the pandemic. The 
dollar has remained relatively strong, 
helping to keep inflation low. The U.S. 
dollar remains the world’s reserve cur-
rency and the safe haven for invest-
ments in the current time of crisis. 
But how long will that be the case if 
we continue to run trillion-dollar defi-
cits each year? Future Congresses will 
not have the same flexibility to deal

with their own crises if we leave them 
saddled with an enormous national 
debt. They will not be able to fund new 
emergency programs without cutting 
other spending or raising revenues. 
That is why it is so critical that we 
get a hold of our debt and deficits once 
we emerge from this pandemic. Regard-
less of what some people far outside of 
the economic mainstream are saying, 
there are constraints on how much 
government can borrow and spend 
without 
triggering 
higher 
interest 
rates or inflation. If we just start 
printing 
money 
to 
pay 
for 
over-
spending, our country could face the 
curse of stagflation, a combination of 
high inflation and low to no economic 
growth. We haven’t had to think about 
this type of devastating combination 
since the late seventies, and that is 
economic history we should not repeat. 
Even if we have the capacity for sig-
nificant, one-time emergency spending, 
we should bear in mind the fact that 
the Federal Government doesn’t have a 
good track record of reducing spending 
after it has ratcheted it up during a 
crisis. 
I would remind my colleagues of the 
old adage: There is nothing so perma-
nent as a temporary government pro-
gram. We are already hearing calls to 
extend or make permanent many of the 
temporary entitlement expansions en-
acted in previous bills. 
More legislation may be needed to 
combat the virus and help the econ-
omy, but we cannot use the crisis to 
justify opening the spending floodgates 
and borrowing from future generations 
to fund nonemergency priorities. Low 
interest rates do not mean that govern-
ment spending is free or that we don’t 
need to spend it wisely. 
The House of Representatives has 
passed a bill that the Congressional 
Budget Office says will cost nearly $3.5 
trillion. That is more than the cost of 
all the COVID–19 legislation we have 
already enacted combined. Are we to 
believe every penny of that is abso-
lutely necessary? 
A $60 billion bailout for union pen-
sions? A massive giveaway for wealthy 
individuals living in high-tax States? 
Billions in student loan forgiveness for 
all borrowers, regardless of income and 
ability to pay? 
We should not view this crisis—a cri-
sis that claimed over 130,000 American 
lives and left millions out of work—as 
an opportunity to enact things that 
have nothing to do with the pandemic. 
And it is not just the lower Chamber. 
The Senate recently approved $17 bil-
lion in new mandatory spending for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
and park and public lands mainte-
nance. We refused to consider an 
amendment to even try to pay for that 
bill, an attempt that would have most-
ly 
charged 
foreigners 
visiting 
our 
parks. As I said, if we don’t try to pay 
for that bill, what will we pay for? 
We are just adding to an already long 
list of unfunded mandatory spending 
programs that we allow to operate on 
autopilot without ever being voted on 
or ever being evaluated again. Nobody 
runs a business like that. Even though 
these programs are allowed to bypass 
the 
annual 
appropriations 
process, 
most of them don’t have any dedicated 
revenue to pay for the spending. And 
those that do collect their own revenue 
often spend more than they take in— 
with no vote. It just happens. Even be-
fore the pandemic, the Congressional 
Budget Office projected that Social Se-
curity spending over the next 10 years 
would total $15.2 trillion. But listen to 
this: The program’s dedicated tax reve-
nues would only cover $12.5 trillion of 
that—$15.2 trillion cost; $12.5 trillion 
revenue. Medicare’s taxes and pre-
miums were projected to cover only 
half of the program’s $12.6 trillion 
spending over the next 10 years. We put 
the rest of it on the Nation’s credit 
card left to be paid for by future gen-
erations. What kind of a crisis are they 
going to have? 
This chart shows again that this is 
the revenue coming in for Social Secu-
rity, and this is the additional we have 
to borrow. This is the money coming in 
from Medicare, and this is the addi-
tional we have to borrow. Medicaid, we 
borrow every bit of it. The total rev-
enue that we receive will not cover 
these deficits, so everything else that 
we do we will have to borrow for it. 
If the interest rate were to go up to 
its norm of 5 percent, we wouldn’t be 
able to do defense; we wouldn’t be able 
to do education; we wouldn’t be able to 
do anything else, infrastructure or oth-
erwise, that we expect the Federal Gov-
ernment to do for us. We have to start 
getting control of it. It isn’t an unlim-
ited source of money. We are putting it 
on the Nation’s credit card, and the fu-
ture generations will have to pay for it. 
There are a couple of ways you can 
pay for it. One is to eliminate the serv-
ices. The other one is to increase reve-
nues. Another one, of course, is to 
eliminate a lot of duplication that we 
have, but we don’t even have an appe-
tite for that. 
We have over 100 housing programs. 
Tell me there is no duplication in 100 
housing programs, but we don’t look at 
them. Most of them are mandatory. So 
we can just ignore the impacts of them 
and the fact that we have multiple ad-
ministrators doing the same job, and 
we don’t even know if it is effective. 
I have been trying for a long time 
through the Budget Committee to get a 
list of the programs we fund. Now, you 
would think, if we are writing checks, 
that we would have a list of programs, 
wouldn’t you? We don’t have a list of 
programs. We don’t know what we own. 
We don’t know when it is going to wear 
out. We don’t know what the cost of re-
placement would be. All are very basic 
business decisions, but we just keep 
sliding everything over to mandatory 
so it has to be paid for regardless of 
whether we have any money or not, 
and we don’t even look at them. That 
has to change, and it has to change 
rapidly or our kids and our grandkids 
will find that all of their money has 
been spent, and all they can do is pay 
more taxes. 
I am frustrated that we are spending 
billions without so much as a discus-
sion about how to pay for things. Yes, 
we needed a strong response to the 
COVID virus, but I am disappointed 
that we can’t work together on respon-
sible solutions, even modest efforts 
like a paid-for fix for our parks and 
public lands maintenance that I men-
tioned would already be paid for by for-
eign visitors. I am dismayed that we 
keep digging the hole deeper for future 
generations. We all owe it to them to 
do better, and I hope we start to do it 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to speak in 
support of Senate amendment No. 1729, 
which I hope will be added today to the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
The goal of this amendment is to fin-
ish—what I hope is to finish a public 
health study that we began with legis-
lation in 2017 to address the contami-
nant known as PFAS. I know the Pre-
siding Officer knows about this because 
she has that chemical in her State as 
well. 
I want to begin by commending the 
work of the Armed Services Com-
mittee—both Chairman INHOFE
and 
Ranking Member REED
for working 
with me to establish the first ever 
human health study of PFAS and to in-
stitute policies that will phase out the 
Defense Department’s use of these 
chemicals over the next several years. 
We began this journey in 2017 when 
we put $10 million into a health 
study—the first of its kind in the coun-
try—to look at the impacts of PFAS on 
humans. At that time, we authorized 
$10 million for 3 years. Unfortunately, 
because of the coronavirus pandemic, it 
is taking longer to complete the study 
than we had hoped, so we are going to 
need some additional funding. 
There is real urgency in addressing 
PFAS. As many of us know, PFAS 
chemicals have emerged as widespread 
pollutants 
in 
the 
drinking 
water 
sources of military bases across this 
country. The main reason is because 
PFAS chemicals were used in fire-
fighting foam that was used by the 
armed services. 
The number of military installations 
with known or suspected contamina-
tion from PFAS continues to rise. In 
March, DOD updated its count of mili-
tary installations impacted by these 
materials from 401 across the country 
to 
651—651 
military 
installations—

which means that they are in almost 
every State in the United States, and 
other studies have reported that this is 
actually a conservative estimate. 
We don’t yet know what the long- 
term risks of exposure to PFAS are be-
cause we are still trying to get re-
search into that, but studies have al-
ready 
linked 
these 
chemicals—and 
there are hundreds of chemicals in the 
PFAS category—to a number of ad-
verse health effects. 
The potential ties between PFAS and 
various forms of cancer are of par-
ticular concern to firefighters who may 
have experienced exposure during fire-
fighting and fire-training exercises. 
On June 11, the Agency for Toxic 
Substances 
and 
Disease 
Registry, 
ATSDR—works as part of the Centers 
for Disease Control—issued a state-
ment expressing concern about how 
PFAS exposure can impact the risk of 
COVID–19 infections. Now, for all of us 
who have constituents who have been 
exposed to PFAS, we know this has 
caused a lot of sleepless nights for 
countless American families both in 
New Hampshire and across the country 
who have been living and working near 
sites contaminated by these materials. 
In my State of New Hampshire, the 
city of Portsmouth, which was the 
home of the former Pease Air Force 
Base, closed a major water supply well 
located at that airbase after the Air 
Force found PFAS in the drinking 
water at levels 121⁄2 times higher than 
the provisional health advisory from 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
at that time. That number has changed 
since then. 
Moreover, State health officials de-
termined that more than 1,500 people, 
including 
children 
who 
attended 
daycare centers near the site, have ele-
vated levels of PFAS in their blood 
from drinking contaminated ground-
water at Pease. I have heard from so 
many parents who are terrified of what 
this contamination means for the 
health of their children. 
One woman, who has been a real lead-
er in responding to the PFAS emer-
gency, Andrea Amico of Portsmouth, 
remembers feeling like her world was 
crashing down when tests showed that 
her two children, exposed to PFAS in 
drinking water at Pease, had elevated 
levels of these materials in their blood. 
She said: ‘‘[T]o actually see it on 
paper, to know it was true, was very 
devastating for me, and the wide range 
of emotions I experienced with those 
results ranged from anger to fear, frus-
tration and guilt.’’ Andrea’s children 
attended the childcare center—one of 
the two childcare centers at Pease. 
I also heard from Alayna Davis of 
Dover and Michelle Dalton of Durham, 
both of whom are mothers with chil-
dren at a daycare center near the 
former base at Portsmouth. Alayna 
said that she was exposed to PFAS at 
Pease when she was pregnant with her 
son. She and her husband were dev-
astated when they learned that their 
son had high levels of PFAS in his 
blood. Michelle was exposed to the con-
taminated water in January of 2011 
when she started working on the base. 
Her 
youngest 
child 
has 
attended 
daycare at Pease since he was 12 weeks 
old, but, of course, he was exposed to 
contamination since conception. 
Stories like Andrea’s, Alayna’s, and 
Michelle’s are not limited to Ports-
mouth, 
sadly. 
Contamination 
from 
PFAS is not limited to military bases 
and airports. That is why this long- 
term health study is so important, and 
it is so critical that we complete it. We 
need to know what the research says 
are the dangers of PFAS. 
Since Congress authorized the study 
in 2017, the ATSDR and Centers for Dis-
ease Control have been working to 
identify the health effects of PFAS ex-
posure, starting with the former Pease 
airbase 
in 
Portsmouth. 
There 
are 
other—I believe there are seven other 
sites around the country that have 
been designated as part of this study. 
Unfortunately, due to COVID–19, as I 
said earlier, the agencies expect addi-
tional costs associated with continuing 
the study, as well as a 1-year delay in 
finalizing the results. 
I think we could all agree that fami-
lies who have been exposed to these 
chemicals deserve answers. What my 
amendment would do is provide addi-
tional funding for the PFAS health 
study to ensure that ATSDR and CDC 
can complete their work and do it 
without delay. 
The safety of our drinking water is 
essential, and it is nonnegotiable. The 
potential serious health effects associ-
ated with exposure to PFAS chemicals 
demand moving forward with policies 
that will protect our communities, es-
pecially our men and women in uni-
form. Senate amendment 1729 would 
help to do just that. 
Of course, this is just the beginning. 
This gives us a baseline study to tell us 
what the health effects are. Once we 
get that study and as we continue to 
move forward, we have a lot of work to 
do to ensure that PFAS—not just on 
military bases but in communities 
across this country, which appear in so 
many different products—that we can 
address that in a way that provides 
some sort of insurance and protection 
to families across this country so they 
know what they are dealing with and 
so they know they can get help. I urge 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. The cars we drive, the 
planes we fly, and the smartphones we 
have in our pockets are all powered by 
computer chips—or semiconductors—a 
technology that is key to modern soci-
ety and that may determine whether 
America or China leads the world in 
the decades to come. 
Computer chips were, of course, pio-
neered in America. Cold War-era initia-
tives like the Apollo Program, DARPA, 
and SEMATECH created the break-
throughs and steady demand for this 
high-tech industry. Storied American 
companies like Intel, IBM, Texas In-
struments, Micron, and others com-
mercialized and then perfected this 
technology. Brilliant American entre-
preneurs and engineers kick-started 
the digital revolution that shaped the 
modern world. That was then. Today, 
sadly, most semiconductors are not 
made in the U.S.A. 
We have learned during this pan-
demic how dangerous it is to rely on 
distant factories and overstretched 
supply chains that can be compromised 
by emergencies or enemies. Well, al-
most three-quarters of the world’s ca-
pacity to make computer chips is lo-
cated in just a handful of countries in 
East Asia—closer to Communist China 
than our shores and all within range of 
the missiles of the People’s Liberation 
Army. 
China is investing huge sums—pos-
sibly $150 billion—in its semiconductor 
industry. This investment is paying 
off. For the first time ever, last year 
China surpassed the United States in 
its capacity for manufacturing ad-
vanced chips. China is projected to sur-
pass Japan and South Korea in the 
next 2 years, which would put it behind 
only Taiwan, an island just 80 miles off 
its shore, which, I must remind you, 
the PLA regularly trains to invade. 
We cannot allow China to dominate 
production of computer chips. Doing so 
would be a grave threat that could 
allow a corrupt clique of Communists 
to impose a high-tech tyranny on the 
rest of the world. That is why I am of-
fering a bipartisan amendment, along 
with Senators CORNYN, SCHUMER, WAR-
NER, and others, to ensure American 
leadership in computer chips in the 
face of this Chinese threat. Our pro-
posal calls for key investments in ad-
vanced factories and research and de-
velopment so that America discovers 
and then produces the next generation 
of semiconductor technology. It also 
requires the Department of Defense 
and the intelligence community to 
work with trusted industry partners to 
secure the supply chain for computers 
chips for our military and other na-
tional security needs. 
This bill is a moonshot investment, 
and 
such 
investments 
don’t 
come 
cheap. So I regret that the question of 
funding this bill has been postponed to 
another time, but I look forward to 
having and winning that debate be-
cause, make no mistake, robust sup-
port is needed to ensure the future of 
the American semiconductor industry. 
At the very least, it is necessary to 
level the playing field so that Amer-
ican companies can compete against 
the 
coercive, 
anti-competitive, 
and 
mercantilist policies of Communist 
China and others. It will provide a 
surge of support and demand for ad-
vanced technology, just as the Federal 
Government has always provided. 
We offer this amendment so that the 
next digital revolution is also made in 
the U.S.A., not in Communist China. I

I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
to express my support for the Cornyn 
amendment, which would, among other 
things, authorize a Federal grant pro-
gram to enable the leading global chip 
companies 
to 
manufacture 
in 
the 
United States. 
I want to commend a bipartisan 
group of Senators who have worked so 
hard on this issue: Senators COTTON, 
CORNYN, SCHUMER, and WARNER. The 
semiconductor manufacturing story is 
similar to many other industries in 
America. The United States invented 
the technology and still leads in re-
search and development, but the manu-
facture of the product itself has stead-
ily migrated to Asia. 
Over time, not just the manufac-
turing expertise and capacity are lost 
but also the science and engineering 
necessary to invent the next genera-
tion of products. While this has hap-
pened to too many industries, the im-
pact is particularly acute in elec-
tronics because electronics power the 
modern economy, fueling all the crit-
ical technologies on which our future 
prosperity depend. 
Asian nations—and, in particular, 
China, Taiwan, and South Korea—have 
for decades pursued aggressive indus-
trial policies to gain control of the 
electronics industry. These policies di-
rected large subsidies and protections 
for fledgling companies that have now 
become global giants. 
While South Korea is an ally, and 
Taiwan is a partner, the plants in those 
countries that make the world’s most 
advanced logic and memory semi-
conductors are highly vulnerable to 
disruption or destruction by China and/ 
or North Korea. In a confrontation in 
this region, China could threaten to 
bring the western economy to its knees 
by halting the flow of semiconductors. 
China itself is investing hundreds of 
billions of dollars in new semicon-
ductor fabrication plants in a relent-
less bid to dominate this industry. In 
10 years, Chinese companies may domi-
nate the production of the chips that 
power 5G wireless networks, artificial 
intelligence, 
cloud 
computing, 
the 
Internet of Things, and autonomous ve-
hicles. 
In America, there is one remaining 
company that is globally competitive 
in logic chips—Intel Corporation—but 
Intel is at least a generation behind its 
main competitors and historically has 
designed and produced chips only for 
its own product line. Its major global 
competitors—the 
Taiwan 
Semicon-
ductor Manufacturing Corporation, or 
TSMC, and Samsung—provide manu-
facturing services for chips designed by 
other companies. These are typically 
so-called fabless chips companies, and 
they include the names of some of our 
most 
famous 
tech 
companies: 
Qualcomm, Xilinx, Nvidia, and Micro-
soft. TSMC and Samsung, together, 
have close to a monopoly on the manu-
facturing of leading-edge semiconduc-
tors for fabless chip companies. 
Recently, there was the good news 
that Intel announced in a letter to the 
Defense Department its intent to com-
pete with its Asian rivals in manufac-
turing chips designed by fabless compa-
nies. Again, these are companies that 
would design the chips and the elec-
tronic processor but would not produce 
the chips. That would be left to these 
other major companies. 
In addition, TSMC and the adminis-
tration announced an agreement to 
bring TSMC to America to produce 
leading edge chips. It is suspected that 
Samsung can be persuaded to set up a 
major manufacturing facility in the 
United States, as well. 
The Defense Department has two 
major studies nearing completion, one 
by the Defense Science Board and one 
conducted in partnership with industry 
by the Under Secretary for Acquisi-
tion, Ellen Lord. They are both ex-
pected to plead for urgent and large- 
scale action to revive U.S. semicon-
ductor manufacturing, but none of this 
is going to happen without funding and 
without a plan. 
We did not lose chip manufacturing 
to Asia simply due to cheap labor, es-
pecially in the chip industry, which is 
not manpower intensive. We lost this 
market sector because the investments 
required are massive and constant and 
because foreign governments heavily 
subsidize them. 
We all prefer to let markets govern 
where competition is fair and mutually 
beneficial, but relentless actions by 
foreign governments to dominate spe-
cific industries regardless of economics 
and where they succeed, like in the 
semiconductor industry, must be coun-
tered by U.S. government action be-
cause of the threat to our national se-
curity and prosperity. 
While this amendment does not in-
clude funding authorizations, it is an 
important first step. This amendment 
will serve notice that the U.S. Senate 
recognizes this very serious issue and 
intends to take corrective action. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and to commit to finding 
funding solutions. Our economic well- 
being and our national security depend 
upon it. 
Madam President, I would now also 
like to speak about Senator Shaheen’s 
amendment, which will be considered 
this afternoon, with your permission. 
I rise in support of Senator Shaheen’s 
amendment to increase fiscal year 2021 
funding by $5 million for the ongoing 
CDC human health study on the effects 
of PFAS substances in drinking water 
sources. 
As most of you are aware, PFOS and 
PFOA are chemicals that are very ef-
fective for extinguishing fires and have 
been used in firefighting foam in the 
Defense Department since the 1970s. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
fluorine 
bonds 
never break, and environmental prob-
lems are presented, which are very dan-
gerous to people. 
The lifetime health advisory for 
PFAS is the equivalent of one grain of 
sand in an Olympic-sized swimming 
pool. The WHO found that these chemi-
cals are likely carcinogenic, especially 
in children and pregnant women, and 
that they can decrease the effective-
ness of vaccines, and they are known to 
cause cancer in animals. 
PFAS has been found in the drinking 
water at over 650 military installations 
in almost every State in the United 
States and overseas. Thousands of 
Americans in many States across the 
United States have already found ele-
vated levels of PFAS in their blood. 
Beginning with the fiscal year 2018 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
the Department of Defense has been 
authorized to transfer funds to the CDC 
for a human health study on the effects 
of all PFAS substances in drinking 
water sources for people. Specifically, 
it seeks to determine the exact types of 
cancers and other toxic effects drink-
ing water with PFAS has on human 
beings. 
For example, years ago, the CDC de-
termined precisely how much lead can 
be ingested before cognitive impacts 
can occur in children. They can and 
should do the same thing with respect 
to PFAS. 
The study should take 7 years to 
complete. So this fiscal year 2021 
NDAA will fund year 4. 
The CDC study received $7 million in 
fiscal year 2018, $10 million in fiscal 
year 2019, $10 million in fiscal year 2020, 
and there is $10 million currently in 
the fiscal year 2021 NDAA amendment. 
Senator SHAHEEN’s amendment would 
increase it to $15 million. It would ac-
celerate our ability to find these crit-
ical answers that affect the health and 
safety of the American people and are 
particularly associated with military 
bases all across the country, which 
means in every one of our States. 
We all recognize the urgent need for 
the CDC to better understand the toxic 
effects of PFAS chemicals on the 
human 
body, 
and 
supporting 
this 
amendment will accomplish just that. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Once again, I commend Senator SHA-
HEEN for her work in developing this 
amendment with respect to PFAS, and 
I commend Senator CORNYN and his 
colleagues for working very, very dili-
gently and perceptively about building 
up our industrial base in order to 
produce microchips so we will be the 
leader in the world and not the fol-
lower. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4325 
July 21, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
the Senate knows, this week we will 
complete our work on the 60th Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act—ac-
tually, 60 years in a row. For decades, 
this legislation has provided the oppor-
tunity for us to take stock of the 
evolving threat landscape and ensure 
that our national defense is prepared to 
meet the challenges on the horizon. 
As technological advancements have 
changed battlefield tactics, each year’s 
NDAA has allowed us to invest in a 
modernized force and advanced weap-
ons. As risks in cyber space emerged as 
a new vector for warfare, this legisla-
tion has allowed us to invest in resil-
ient networks and a talented work-
force. 
As the global order has shifted, this 
annual bill has given us the oppor-
tunity to identify the greatest threats 
to our country and to take strategic 
action. This year’s national defense au-
thorization bill is no exception. It con-
tinues to invest in a modernized na-
tional defense that is critical to main-
taining peace through strength. 
That is something we need to remem-
ber, which Ronald Reagan taught all of 
us. Weakness is provocative. Bullies 
look for opportunities to take advan-
tage of weakness. It is strength in our 
leadership, particularly with our mili-
tary, that helps us maintain the peace. 
This bill also devotes resources to re-
gain our competitive advantage over 
our greatest opponents to freedom and 
democracy today, including China and 
the Communist Party. In my lifetime, 
China has gone from a poor and iso-
lated country to now accounting for 
nearly 20 percent of the global gross 
domestic product. But China’s eco-
nomic muscle isn’t the reason it tops 
America’s watch list. The Chinese 
Communist Party’s ruling strategy can 
best be described as ‘‘win at all costs,’’ 
and, sadly, the victims of that strategy 
are often the Chinese people them-
selves. 
On the Senate floor yesterday, I 
spoke about some of the latest human 
rights violations by the Communist 
Party in China—their recent move to 
erode the freedoms and autonomy of 
Hong Kong, their efforts to silence and 
punish protesters who dare to speak 
out against the Chinese Communist 
Party, their ongoing ethnic cleansing 
campaign targeted at the Uighur peo-
ple. 
China continues to demonstrate a 
complete lack of respect for basic 
human rights and dignities, and I re-
main concerned by the growing threat 
they pose to the world order, including 
the United States of America. 
Attorney General Bill Barr recently 
gave a speech about the challenges 
posed by an increasingly powerful, 
wealthy, and relentless China. It is a 
great speech, which I commend to you. 
It provides an impressive overview of 
how the Communist Party manipulates 
American businesses and industries, 
steals intellectual property, surveils 
and censors its own people, and seeks 
to exert its power and influence in the 
United States. 
For those who are unfamiliar with 
the modern relationship between the 
United States and China and the risks 
and vulnerability this creates, I highly 
recommend reading the speech of the 
Attorney General. In that speech, he 
discusses the threats posed by the 
Communist Party’s Made in China 2025 
initiative, which seeks to achieve Chi-
nese dominance in high-tech manufac-
turing. For everything from electric 
cars to advanced robotics, to artificial 
intelligence, China wants to lead glob-
al production. 
While this is framed as a way to re-
duce the dependence on foreign tech-
nology and strengthen domestic manu-
facturing, these ambitions paint an 
alarming picture for the United States 
and our allies. 
As the Attorney General noted, it is 
clear that the People’s Republic of 
China seeks not merely to join the 
ranks of other advanced industrial 
economies but to replace them alto-
gether. 
Before any piece of technology be-
comes usable for its audience, it in-
cludes parts, pieces, and materials that 
come from, literally, all over the 
world. Regardless of where that final 
product is assembled and packaged, 
each of those individual pieces are the 
key to protecting the supply chain that 
creates our most valuable assets. 
If the COVID–19 virus taught us any-
thing, it has given us a clear picture of 
how vulnerable our unsecured supply 
chains are. We lean heavily on China— 
too heavily—for things like masks, 
gloves, 
gowns, 
ventilators—all 
the 
equipment for which the need was sky-
rocketing earlier this year. 
As a result of the fact that the world 
was dependent on China to produce this 
critical equipment, hospitals reached 
dangerously low levels of personal pro-
tective equipment. In the meantime, 
China refused to disclose to the rest of 
the world that the virus had indeed 
broken out in its country so that it 
could, in fact, hoard the personal pro-
tective equipment they knew the rest 
of the world would need. 
As a result of the lack of a secure 
supply chain, healthcare workers were 
using a single mask throughout an en-
tire shift, putting both themselves and 
patients at risk. This has been a wake- 
up call—or should have been a wake-up 
call—on supply chain vulnerabilities 
and a reminder that we need to take 
action today to secure our supply 
chains for tomorrow. 
One of the biggest of these vulnera-
bilities we are facing today is a lack of 
domestic 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing. These chips are everywhere in 
almost every product. They are the un-
derlying technology in everything from 
our cell phones and towers to com-
puters, to precision agriculture, to mis-
sile defense systems. 
As you can imagine, as technologies 
have become more sophisticated in re-
cent years, the demand for high-end 
semiconductors has skyrocketed. In 
fact, U.S. companies command 47 per-
cent of the global market of these inte-
grated circuit chips. But when it comes 
to manufacturing, we are falling fur-
ther and further behind. 
Since 2000, the United States has 
dropped from producing roughly a 
quarter of the world’s semiconductors 
to only 12 percent, and you need only 
one guess as to which country stepped 
up to manufacture these critical de-
vices. You guessed right. It is China. 
In the same period, China has gone 
from manufacturing zero chips to 16 
percent of the world’s supply and plans 
on investing another $1.4 trillion in 
semiconductor technologies. 
America has lost ground to our glob-
al competitors, and unless we take ac-
tion, it is estimated that by 2030, 83 
percent of the global semiconductor 
manufacturing capacity will be not 
here but in Asia. 
We need to bring those manufac-
turing jobs back to the United States 
and provide end-to-end security in our 
semiconductor supply chain. 
Of course, that is much easier said 
than done. Building a new foundry, 
which is where these semiconductors 
are manufactured, is very expensive 
and, quite frankly, will not happen 
without an investment from the Fed-
eral Government. The Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment estimates that 21 major semicon-
ductor firms across a number of coun-
tries receive more than $50 billion in 
government support between 2014 and 
2018. 
Some of these countries investing in 
manufacturing of these technologies 
were South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, 
Ireland, Germany, and, you guessed it, 
China. If we are going to regain lost 
ground 
in 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing and secure one of our most crit-
ical supply chains, it is going to take a 
strategic investment, and that is ex-
actly where the CHIPS for America Act 
will deliver. 
Senator WARNER, the distinguished 
Democratic Senator from Virginia, and 
I have introduced legislation to restore 
American leadership in semiconductor 
manufacturing and ensure long-term 
national security and economic com-
petitiveness. We worked hand in hand 
with our colleagues, Senator COTTON 
from Arkansas and Senator SCHUMER 
from New York, in drafting the amend-
ment before the Senate that we will 
vote on this evening. It is truly a bi-
partisan product. 
It achieves that goal by creating a 
Federal incentive program through the 
Department of Commerce to encourage

semiconductor 
manufacturing 
right 
here in the good old USA. In short, it 
would stimulate domestic advanced 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
and 
boost both our national security and 
global competitiveness. It will enable 
us to bring manufacturing of these 
critical devices back onto American 
soil and eliminate this critical na-
tional security and economic vulnera-
bility. 
As I mentioned, these chips are lit-
erally everywhere. Many of you have 
them in your pockets right now or on 
your wrists. Semiconductors are the 
foundational technology for our mili-
tary systems, our critical infrastruc-
ture, 
our 
telecommunications, 
healthcare, agriculture, and manufac-
turing. We want these devices to run 
on made-in-America semiconductors. 
As we conclude our work on the Na-
tional defense authorization bill, I am 
glad the Senate has the opportunity to 
vote on this legislation as an amend-
ment. I am grateful to the chairman of 
the Armed Services Committee, Chair-
man INHOFE, and Ranking Member 
REED for making sure that happens. 
This legislation supports a critical goal 
of the National Defense Authorization 
Act and our national defense strategy, 
which is strategic competition with 
China. That is where we are right now. 
It prioritizes advancements in the 
critical technologies that will mod-
ernize our national defense and restore 
our competitive edge, all while allow-
ing us to secure our most critical sup-
ply chains. 
I hope our colleagues will all join me 
in supporting this legislation so that 
we can reclaim American leadership in 
semiconductor manufacturing, so we 
can support American jobs, and so we 
can invest in both a strong national se-
curity and our economy. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2244 
(Purpose: To restore American lead-
ership in semiconductor manufacturing 
by increasing federal incentives in 
order to enable advanced research and 
development, secure the supply chain, 
and ensure long-term national security 
and economic competitiveness.) 
Madam President, I call up my 
amendment No. 2244 and ask that it be 
read. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CORNYN], for 
himself and others, proposes an amendment 
numbered 2244. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today with deep sorrow and strong 
determination. 
I am feeling deep sorrow over the loss 
of one of our Nation’s great moral lead-
ers and a dear friend of mine, Congress-
man John Lewis. 
As anyone who had ever met John 
knows, he was incredibly kind. He was 
a man who had seen so much of our Na-
tion’s history and written so much of 
our Nation’s history, and yet he still 
treated everybody with dignity and re-
spect. I have been honored to serve 
alongside him in the House and to be-
come his friend. 
He was so supportive of me when I 
decided to run for the U.S. Senate. In 
fact, I will never forget how knowing 
that he believed in me helped give me 
the courage to jump into a race against 
an incumbent Senator. 
I am grieving the loss of my friend. 
I am also determined. Congressman 
Lewis dedicated his entire life to the 
fight for justice and equality. I am de-
termined to do everything I can to do 
my part to ensure that his life’s work 
continues. 
John Lewis came from very humble 
beginnings. He was one of 10 children of 
Willie Mae and Eddie Lewis, who 
worked as sharecroppers. Making a liv-
ing off the land has always been hard, 
but it was even harder in the 1940s in 
the Deep South, where racism and dis-
crimination were as relentless as the 
Alabama Sun. 
Faith in God was essential, and John 
had that faith in abundance. As a child, 
he wanted to be a preacher, and he cer-
tainly could have been. From reading 
Bible verses to the family chickens as 
a child to speaking alongside Dr. King 
at the March on Washington at just 23 
years old, to his message at the 55th 
anniversary of Selma earlier this year, 
John had a preacher’s ability to inspire 
all of us. 
Like a preacher, John knew that 
words alone aren’t enough. When words 
come from the pulpit on Sunday and 
then they show up on the street on 
Tuesday, that is when the change real-
ly 
happens. 
John 
Lewis 
certainly 
showed up over and over and over 
again. He sat down at lunch counters. 
He sat in the front of buses. He spent 
his 21st birthday in jail after blocking 
the entrance to a theater that refused 
to sell tickets to people who look like 
him. 
He was arrested more than 40 times, 
beaten by Klansmen, and nearly killed 
marching across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. 
He never stopped showing up and 
causing ‘‘good trouble.’’ Just 6 weeks 
before he died, he stopped by the Black 
Lives Matter Plaza here in Wash-
ington, DC. It was the last time he was 
seen in public. 
Time and again, John Lewis put his 
life on the line in order to protect peo-
ple’s fundamental rights, including the 
right to vote. John knew that words 
alone can never be enough, and we have 
to be willing to take action. 
Late last year, the House passed the 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. It 
would restore section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act that was overturned by the 
Supreme Court in 2013. For 228 days, 
this important bill has been gathering 
dust on Leader MCCONNELL’s desk—228 
days of inaction. 
Senator LEAHY is reintroducing the 
bill in the Senate as the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Act of 2020. I am proud 
to be a cosponsor of this important 
bill. It is time to pass it and get it 
signed into law in Congressman Lewis’s 
honor. 
At the 55th anniversary of Selma in 
March, John reminded us what is at 
stake. He said this: 
We were beaten, we were tear-gassed. I 
thought I was going to die on this bridge. 
But somehow and some way, God almighty 
helped me here. 
He added this: 
I’m not going to give up. I’m not going to 
give in. We’re going to continue to fight. . . . 
We must use the vote as a nonviolent instru-
ment or tool to redeem the soul of America. 
I have seen the soul of America, and 
that soul looks a lot like my friend, 
John Lewis. I urge us to take up the 
Voting Rights Act in John’s name and 
to pass it as soon as possible and en-
sure that his legacy lives on. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1044 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, a 
few steps from the Senate Chamber, at 
my whip’s office, on the credenza be-
hind my desk, is a framed government 
document. It is my mother’s natu-
ralization certificate. She was an im-
migrant to this country. She was 
brought here at the age of 2 from Lith-
uania. She lived long enough to see me 
being sworn in to the U.S. Senate. I am 
proud of the fact that I stand here 
today as the son of an immigrant. That 
is my story. It is my family’s story. It 
is America’s story. 
I 
believe 
immigration 
has 
made 
America the Nation that it is today. 
Immigrants are an integral part of our 
economy, our culture, and our soul. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
deadly 
coronavirus pandemic, we should never 
forget that 1 in 6 healthcare and social 
service workers—that is 3.1 million 
people out of 18.7 million—is an immi-
grant. They risk their lives every day 
in the midst of this pandemic for the 
good of this Nation. Immigrants are 
playing this critical role in the battle 
against COVID–19. Yet our broken im-
migration laws do not allow many of 
them to fulfill their dreams of finally 
becoming Americans. 
Thousands of immigrant workers, in-
cluding many health workers, are suf-
fering because of a serious problem in 
our immigration system—the green 
card backlog. What is a green card? A 
green card is our immigration ticket. If 
you are here as a temporary worker, a 
green card or legal permanent resident 
status allows you to remain in the 
United States without having fear of

deportation and to be on a path toward 
permanent citizenship in the United 
States. 
Green cards are critical in the lives 
of so many who are here on temporary 
and work visas. The backlog in this 
system puts families at risk of losing 
their immigration status, as they wait 
year after weary year to finally make 
it through this green card backlog, and 
it stops their ability, many times, to 
participate in the fight against COVID– 
19 and to work toward building our 
economy. 
Under the current law, there are not 
nearly enough immigrant visas—also 
known as green cards—available each 
year. The current numbers for 140,000 
EB immigrant visas were established in 
1990—30 years ago. The American econ-
omy has doubled, but the number of 
green cards has remained the same. As 
a result, immigrants are stuck in a 
crippling backlog year after year after 
year. Close to 5 million future Ameri-
cans are in line, waiting for these green 
cards. Many are working in the United 
States on temporary visas while many 
are waiting overseas and are separated 
from their families. Only 226,000 family 
green cards and 140,000 employment 
green cards are available each year. 
The backlogs are a real hardship on 
these families who are caught in this 
immigration limbo. For example, the 
children in many of these families age 
out and face deportation. How does this 
happen? Well, those applying for the 
green cards also list their spouses and 
children. If they have to wait a long pe-
riod of time and the children reach the 
age of 21, they are no longer protected 
by the parent’s efforts to obtain the 
green cards, and they can be deported 
at any time. For many children who 
age out and face deportation as they 
reach the age of 21, it is a family dis-
aster. 
The solution to this green card back-
log is eminently clear to anyone who 
looks at it: Increase the number of 
green cards. The number that might 
have made sense 30 years ago makes no 
sense today. 
The senior Senator from Utah, Sen-
ator LEE, with whom I have worked on 
previous legislation, has introduced S. 
386, known as the Fairness for High- 
Skilled Immigrants Act, to address 
this issue. I have a basic concern with 
this bill, and I have told Senator LEE. 
S. 386 adds no additional green cards, 
and without additional green cards, S. 
386 will not reduce the backlog or the 
wait. 
Here is what the Congressional Re-
search Service says about Senator 
LEE’s legislation. To all of those fol-
lowing this debate, don’t take my word 
for it; read the Congressional Research 
Service’s study that was released on 
March 26, 2020, entitled the ‘‘Employ-
ment-Based 
Immigration 
Backlog.’’ 
What does it write about Senator LEE’s 
bill? It writes: 
S. 386 would not reduce future backlogs 
compared to current law. . . . The total 
backlog for all three categories [of employ-
ment visas] would increase from an esti-
mated 915,497 individuals currently to an es-
timated 
2,195,795 
individuals 
by 
FY2030. 
These outcomes would occur whether or not 
S. 386 is enacted [and here are the operative 
words] because the bill maintains the cur-
rent limit on the number of green cards 
issued. 
That is the bottom line. If you don’t 
change the number of green cards and 
5 million people are in the queue, wait-
ing for 140,000 employment green cards 
and 226,000 family green cards, you un-
derstand the math. 
Despite my concerns that S. 386 
would not work as intended, I agreed to 
sit down with Senator LEE and work in 
good faith to resolve our differences. 
Last December, we reached an agree-
ment on an amendment to his bill that 
addressed many of these concerns. 
I want to be clear. This amendment 
was far from perfect and not what I 
would have written. The biggest prob-
lem is that it still does not increase 
the number of green cards. As a result, 
it would not eliminate the backlog. 
But it has made a substantial improve-
ment to his original bill. 
Here is how it reads: 
It protects immigrants and their families 
who are stuck in the backlog. Immigrant 
workers and their immediate family mem-
bers would be allowed to ‘‘early file’’ [a pro-
vision that Senator LEE suggested and I ac-
cepted] for their green cards. They would not 
receive their green cards early, but they 
would be able to switch jobs and travel with-
out losing immigration status. 
I thought that was fair. Early filing 
adds a critical protection that was not 
in the original Lee S. 386. It prevents 
the children of immigrant workers 
from aging out of green card eligibility 
so that they will not face deportation 
while they are waiting for green cards. 
Our agreement also included a green 
card set-aside for immigrant workers 
who were stuck in the backlog over-
seas. The amendment would reserve 
4,600 green cards on an annual basis for 
immigrant workers who would not be 
eligible for early filing because they 
would be outside the United States. 
This number is based on the approxi-
mate number of people who apply for 
employment green cards from overseas 
each year. 
Finally, our agreement would crack 
down on the abuse of H–1B temporary 
work visas. I thought this was going to 
be an easy provision. It has turned out 
to be the real problem in this bill, and 
let me tell you why. The amendment 
prohibits companies from hiring addi-
tional H–1B workers if the companies’ 
workforces have more than 50 employ-
ees and if more than 50 percent are 
temporary workers. This 50–50 rule is 
from the bipartisan H–1B reform bill 
that I offered with Senator GRASSLEY, 
Republican of Iowa. This provision was 
included in the comprehensive immi-
gration reform bill, which I voted for 
and which passed in the Senate. Sen-
ator LEE has said, ‘‘This is a common-
sense reform to root out abuse.’’ 
When most people think of the H–1B 
visa, they think of well-known compa-
nies—Microsoft, Google—that hire top- 
notch professionals at top dollar when 
no American is available. That is how 
the program was supposed to work, but 
the reality is different. In fact, the top 
recipients of H–1B visas are outsourc-
ing companies that use loopholes in the 
law to exploit immigrant workers and 
even offshore American jobs. 
In the most recent year for which 
data is available, 8 of the top 10 recipi-
ents of new H–1B visas were outsourc-
ing companies. The vice president of 
one of them, Tata—one of the leading 
firms—candidly acknowledged that it 
uses H–1Bs to exploit immigrant work-
ers. 
He said: 
Our wage per employee is 20–25 percent 
lesser than the U.S. wage for a similar em-
ployee. . . . The issue is that of getting 
workers in the U.S. on wages far lower than 
local wage. 
It is important to understand that 
the vast majority of immigrant work-
ers in the backlog in the United States 
is on an H–1B temporary work visa. So 
if we want to stop the future exploi-
tation of immigrant workers and the 
displacement of American workers, we 
have to stop the abuse of H–1B visas. 
Back in December, I asked my Demo-
cratic colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan agreement that Senator LEE and 
I reached. They all agreed. I told Sen-
ator LEE that I wanted to move imme-
diately to solve this problem. There 
were so many people whose lives were 
tied up in this debate. However, Sen-
ator LEE asked me for more time to 
discuss it with his colleagues. I agreed. 
In March, 3 months later, Senator 
LEE told me he wanted to make signifi-
cant changes in the agreement, and he 
said that without these changes he 
could no longer support it. 
Some of the changes were made at 
the request of the Trump administra-
tion, which I will note is not exactly 
the most reliable or objective source 
on advice on immigration. Let me 
briefly explain the changes Senator 
LEE demanded. 
The original version of Senator LEE’s 
bill provides that no individual who 
had already been approved for a green 
card would receive the green card at a 
later time than they otherwise would 
have. This provision, known as a hold 
harmless clause, is a critical protec-
tion that assures immigrants who have 
been waiting years, patiently, in line 
that nothing we do on the floor will 
change the number of years they have 
to wait—perhaps improve them but not 
make them worse. 
Now, at the request of the Trump ad-
ministration, Senator LEE wants to de-
lete this hold harmless provision which 
was in his original bill. That would 
jeopardize many people who are inno-
cently waiting patiently for their op-
portunity. 
Second, Senator LEE wants to delay 
for 3 years the effective date of the 50– 
50 rule to crack down on outsourcing 
companies. 
Why on Earth would we give compa-
nies that are outsourcing American

jobs and exploiting immigrant workers 
a free pass for 3 more years? 
Third, at the request of the Trump 
administration, Senator LEE wanted to 
make two changes that would allow 
early filing for people who are stuck in 
the green card backlog. He would delay 
early filing for 1 year—1 more year for 
children to age out; 1 more year for 
them to wait. Why? 
That means that any children who 
age out in the meantime lose their 
chance for a green card and will be sub-
ject to deportation. 
He would also require that immi-
grant workers could only ‘‘early file’’ 
after their green card petition had been 
approved for 2 years—a 2-year delay on 
top of a 3-year delay. Any children who 
had aged out during this new 2-year 
waiting period would not be protected 
and would also be subject to deporta-
tion. 
Why is Senator LEE—or at least 
those in the Trump administration ad-
vising him—so afraid that these chil-
dren might have a future in America? 
When we met in March, I told Sen-
ator LEE these changes were not ac-
ceptable. It has now been 7 months 
since Senator LEE and I reached our 
original agreement and more than 4 
months since we met in March. Immi-
grants who are stuck in the backlog 
and their children have waited long 
enough. 
I am now going to ask unanimous 
consent on my agreement with Senator 
LEE from December 2019—the Fairness 
for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, as 
amended by the Lee substitute amend-
ment. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on the Ju-
diciary be discharged from further con-
sideration of H.R. 1044, Fairness for 
High-Skilled Immigrants Act, and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; 
further, 
that 
the 
Lee 
amendment at the desk be agreed to, 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed, and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I am a little 
flabbergasted at this moment, when I 
find myself in a rare circumstance of 
disagreeing with literally every word 
uttered by my colleague, the senior 
Senator from Illinois. He is my friend. 
He and I have worked together on a 
number of issues—criminal justice re-
form, protecting the civil liberties of 
Americans when it comes to domestic 
surveillance, all kinds of things on the 
Judiciary Committee. 
I disagree with nearly every single 
word, every syllable he just uttered. I 
find myself wondering whether we ex-
perienced alternate universes in recent 
months. 
I have worked nearly the entire time 
I have been in the U.S. Senate on this 
issue—for years, nearly 91⁄2 years, on 
discrete pieces of legislation, trying to 
fix immigration. Immigration is a big 
issue. It is a contentious issue. It is an 
issue as to which, to put it mildly, 
there is not always bipartisan con-
sensus. It is one of the areas that I 
have concluded remains open and pos-
sible for bipartisan agreement, is on 
taking discrete, individual problem 
areas within our immigration code and 
updating them and modernizing them. 
So what we are talking here today 
about is a bill that I have long cham-
pioned, the Fairness for High-Skilled 
Immigrants Act. My sole purpose for 
championing that legislation—frankly, 
at great personal expense to myself, at 
great political expense—was to bring 
some equity to a system that unduly 
burdens some immigrants based on 
their country of origin and based, spe-
cifically, on the arbitrary factor of the 
population of the nation of origin of 
the immigrant in question. 
There has been a lot of misinforma-
tion at both ends of the political spec-
trum, at every point in between, about 
this legislation. It has been attacked 
from the right, from the left, from ev-
erywhere else. A lot of people claim 
falsely that it would change the total 
number of green cards available. It 
wouldn’t, as Senator DURBIN just ac-
knowledged. That is one of the few 
things that he said just now with which 
I think I can agree. 
But over the years, we have had a 
number of Senators objecting to this 
for different reasons. Every time we re-
solve one objection—sometimes we will 
resolve two objections, and then one 
other will pop up. Then we will resolve 
that one, and three others will pop up. 
We have been doing this for years and 
years, and I have worked in good faith 
with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle in order to resolve those concerns. 
Now, most recently, Senator DURBIN 
objected to it. Just as I have with each 
objector before him, I worked with 
Senator DURBIN last fall in order to re-
solve some of his concerns with the leg-
islation. 
In December, as he states, we came 
to an agreement. We came to an agree-
ment on a way that we could move for-
ward. We set some objectives, and he 
accurately characterized many of those 
objectives. What I told Senator DURBIN 
at the time was that I was reluctant to 
announce that publicly because we 
hadn’t yet made or received a request 
or a response to our request for tech-
nical assistance and input from the af-
fected 
agencies—most 
importantly, 
from the State Department and from 
USCIS. 
At the time, Senator DURBIN
re-
quested that we go to the floor; that we 
introduce it. I, reluctantly, and per-
haps against my better judgment, 
agreed to do that, in part based on the 
fact that Senator DURBIN was taking a 
lot of heat at the time. People were 
saying that he was opposed to the idea 
categorically, and I wanted to work 
with him in good faith to do it. 
At the time we had that discussion— 
at the time the Senator and I made 
that agreement—I made absolutely 
abundantly clear we still needed to get 
technical input, and we still needed to 
get the input of cosponsors of the legis-
lation. 
But out of consideration for the Sen-
ator and a lot of the political heat you 
were taking at the time, I agreed, with 
that understanding, to go to the floor 
and announce that we had reached an 
agreement in principle. 
I have honored every single piece of 
that agreement in principle, and I 
strongly resent your suggestion to the 
contrary—every single piece of it. 
There is not one substantive piece of 
this as to which I have changed—not 
one of them, not the 50–50 rule, not the 
4,600 set-aside, not the early filing. 
The changes that we made were in re-
sponse to the technical assistance re-
quest that we made to USCIS and a 
couple from the State Department. 
They had almost entirely to do with 
what was feasible, what was adminis-
tratively possible to implement the 
legislation. After all, we don’t want to 
enact legislation that cannot be imple-
mented 
without 
compromising 
the 
other responsibilities that that agency 
has. 
So after seeking this feedback, we 
understood that the language, as writ-
ten, was, in some respects, technically 
not feasible for USCIS to implement as 
we had written it. But, here again, I 
told him: We inevitably will have to 
make some modifications based on the 
feasibility of this. 
So I went back to Senator DURBIN, 
and in light of the USCIS comments 
and the response to our request for 
technical assistance from USCIS, we 
made some changes. I went back to 
Senator DURBIN. My recollection is 
that it was in February. You say 
March. I believe it was February. But 
regardless, I came back to you, and I 
told you: We are honoring the agree-
ment. We are going to have to delay 
the implementation of some of it so as 
to make it technically feasible. 
Some of these provisions were modi-
fied somewhat as to the timing of their 
implementation, but we honored the 
spirit and the letter of our agreement. 
And yet, when we presented these 
changes to Senator DURBIN, he flatout 
rejected them, almost without any dis-
cussion at all and almost without any 
discussion about how these materially 
departed from the agreement we had 
reached in December in good faith that 
we announced the existence of on the 
Senate floor, against my better judg-
ment, out of the goodness of my heart, 
given the amount of political pressure 
Senator DURBIN was getting on this. 
And he refused, at that point, to con-
tinue negotiations. 
This, by the way, was after months 
and months of trying to get him to ne-
gotiate; months and months of trying 
to get him to the table that we 
reached, finally, in December. 
So I find it astounding. If the Sen-
ator is, once again, feeling the political 
expediency to do so, I am happy to con-
tinue these discussions with him, but

don’t come here and suggest falsely, as 
he just has, that I have materially de-
parted from the agreement we reached 
because I did not. 
Now, I hope that he is as willing as I 
am to allow businesses a window of 
time to come into compliance with the 
new 50–50 rule so that we don’t unnec-
essarily burden the H1–B workers who 
are already here. That is what my 
changes do, is make it so we don’t un-
duly burden those. 
I hope the Senator is as willing as I 
am to extend the transition period be-
fore the per-country caps are fully lift-
ed to allow immigrants from around 
the world the opportunity to ease into 
the process. 
I hope he is willing, as I am, to tack-
le one major immigration problem at a 
time in the hope of improving the con-
dition of immigrants in our country 
without insisting on poison pills. 
If there is one thing we have learned 
about immigration reform in recent 
years is that if you try to reform ev-
erything at once, you will guarantee 
the failure of the bill. I hope that is not 
what you are trying to do here, but 
that is the effect it has when you try to 
add in other extraneous points. 
Never, by the way, was there ever a 
discussion about increasing the total 
number of visas in this. That was never 
the objective. I never hinted at that. 
You acknowledged that in every one of 
our discussions. 
If you are interested in these prin-
ciples, as I am, we should be able to 
find a path forward because all of these 
changes—all the changes we made to 
our agreement—were simply made out 
of expediency in order to be able to en-
sure that the legislation could, in fact, 
move forward; that it was feasible to 
implement; that it could resolve the 
concerns that you expressed to me and 
could do so in a manner to ensure the 
best possible outcome. 
If Senator DURBIN can agree on these 
changes, we can pass this legislation. 
We can pass it not just today, we can 
pass it right now, this very moment. I 
call on him to do so. 
If the Senator feels he can work with 
these changes, I am happy to do that as 
well. 
As I said in February, my door is 
open, and I am always willing to talk 
about these things with the Senator if 
he is willing to work with me. 
So I ask that the Senator modify his 
request to withdraw the amendment at 
the desk and include my new amend-
ment, which is at the desk, the amend-
ment be considered and agreed to, the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time and passed, and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, let me say 
to Senator LEE, the changes he came 
back with were significant. 
Removing the hold harmless provi-
sion, to me, is fundamentally unfair to 
anyone who has been waiting patiently 
for a green card. Why would the Sen-
ator jeopardize anyone and make them 
wait even longer for a green card? That 
was one of the modifications he sug-
gested. 
The two other modifications the Sen-
ator suggested delayed protection for 
children that left them subject to de-
portation for 2 to 3 years. Why would 
we do that? We both agree that is a ter-
rible outcome. That was one of his 
modifications as well. 
As far as the 50–50 rule, listen, I be-
lieve that is what is driving this con-
versation. These outsourcing compa-
nies make a bundle of money, and 
there are people who want to keep 
them in business and making money, 
even at the expense of American work-
ers, and I think that is wrong. I really 
do. 
I can’t believe that that is what is 
really going to stop us now at this 
point, to try to protect these outsourc-
ing companies for 3 years before this 
provision affects them. 
As far as what we can do here today, 
I think what I am going to offer next is 
going to be the simplest thing we can 
achieve and maybe more at a later 
date. But let us protect the children. 
That is the next thing I am going to 
offer. 
Let us protect the children and make 
sure that as they are waiting in line, 
they can’t age out and be deported. 
That is not an unreasonable request. 
So I am going to refuse to agree to 
the modification, but I will offer pro-
tection for the children next, and I 
hope—let’s agree on that today and 
continue the rest of the discussion be-
yond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, look, the hold 
harmless issue was taken care of with 
the 3- to 9-year transition. That is why 
we made the 3- to 9-year transition, 
was to take care of the hold harmless 
provision. 
Now, if the Senator wants to nego-
tiate the terms of that, we can talk 
about that right now. We can resolve 
that right now. But make no mistake, 
the Senator is fundamentally changing 
and altering the terms of what we 
agreed to, and he is accusing me of, 
fundamentally, materially, changing 
the terms of the agreement, when all I 
have done is what we agreed to in De-
cember. 
What the Senator is suggesting here 
is a deviation from what is possible. I 
can’t agree to what is not possible, to 
what contravenes what USCIS has said 
it is capable of implementing. On that 
basis, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
have a few minutes more to close this 
debate. I ask forbearance of those who 
are prepared for the 4 p.m. vote. I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 10 ad-
ditional minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LEE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I with-
draw my objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is withdrawn. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am 
sorry we were unable to reach an 
agreement today. 
The proposal which I am about to 
make, called the Protect Children of 
Immigrant Workers Act, simply en-
sures that children will not age out in 
this process. 
How many times do parents come to 
me with tears in their eyes saying: 
Don’t hurt my child. 
Here is our chance, as we work out 
all the other issues, to take care of this 
one provision. It would not increase 
the number of green cards. It does not 
get into the other issues we have de-
bated. I ask the Senator to please, for 
the sake of these children, give them 
the protections, and let us continue to 
try and negotiate the other provisions. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of my bill, the Protect Chil-
dren of Immigrant Workers Act, which 
is at the desk; that the bill be consid-
ered read three times and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, it should have been 
brought forward. We would have loved 
to have considered it. I haven’t seen it 
yet. My staff saw it for the first time 
earlier today. I would love to have a 
look at it. 
This is something that could have 
been brought up at any moment in the 
last six or seven months, or the last 
year. I would be happy to look at it 
now, but I can’t agree to pass some-
thing that I have not seen. So, there-
fore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the 
interest of the moment, I cannot offer 
my third amendment, but I will say 
this: It will be back. This is a chance to 
do something for the children. It is 
very simple. You know what it is. Let’s 
do this. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah is recognized. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I could not 
agree more. We should do this. I could 
not agree more that we need to elimi-
nate the outdated, outmoded Elvis 
Presley era immigration provision that 
discriminates against individuals on 
the basis of their country of origin, on 
the basis of the population of the coun-
try in which they were born. 
There are reasons why immigration 
policy is a contentious one. There were 
reasons why previous efforts have

failed, and it always has to do with the 
fact that people tend to pile on. They 
get desperate. It is hard for us to re-
form the immigration code. When 
somebody suggests 1 reform, others 
suggest 10 more, and, before long, it 
chokes the horse. You can’t move for-
ward with it. 
This one is focused on a very simple 
concept, that regardless of how many 
visas we issue, regardless of how many 
green cards we issue, there are a lot of 
ways to allocate the number that we 
have. Let’s start with the number we 
have and figure out whatever reasons 
ought 
to 
influence 
that 
decision. 
Among them should not be the country 
in which you were born. 
Imagine two hypothetical would-be 
employment-based green card recipi-
ents who are otherwise eligible. Immi-
grant A and B are identical in all re-
spects—in their employment qualifica-
tions, their education, proficiency in 
English, and every meaningful char-
acteristic except one. Immigrant A 
happens to be born in Luxembourg and 
immigrant B happens to have been 
born in India. Because India has a large 
population and Luxembourg has a 
small population, the immigrant from 
India is going to be discriminated 
against. 
It is senseless and based on a bygone 
era in which immigration policy didn’t 
make sense by today’s standards. We 
ought to be able to get around that. 
I agree with Mr. DURBIN
that we 
should pass this right now. There is no 
reason not to.

The Senator from Oklahoma. 
S. 4049 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right 
now, we are in the middle of what I 
have referred to several times as what 
I consider to be the most significant 
bill of the year, the National Defense 
Authorization Act—one that you can 
almost be sure will pass. This will be 
the 60th consecutive year it has passed. 
That is a pretty good indication it is 
going to pass. 
That comes with problems, however. 
People know that a bill is going to 
pass, so you get a lot of pieces of legis-
lation that had not been able to get 
passed, and it may be a whole year, and 
it becomes a part of this bill. It is more 
than just the Defense authorization 
bill, but it is the most significant one. 
Before we even came to the floor, we 
did something that we have been work-
ing on now—at least I know person-
ally—for 4 years, and that is to put 
ourselves in a position where just in 
case we find ourselves where we can’t 
get amendments—all it takes is one 
person to object, and there will be no 
amendments if this happens. We de-
cided to go ahead and put this bill to-
gether and do it in such a way that the 
Members are actually drafting the bill. 
We have 700 Member items. 
You might remember that back in 
January, we started talking about this, 
saying: If you want to have an amend-
ment in the Defense authorization bill, 
even though it is not going to become 
effective until a year from December, 
you better get down there and do it be-
cause now is the time you can get that 
done. Well, we ended up with 700 Mem-
ber items, and that was before we even 
got to the floor, and then more were 
added. We added another 140 amend-
ments after that. 
You can say that this bill was passed 
by you—I am talking about the Mem-
bers, Democrats and Republicans—in 
the Chamber because these items all 
came out of it. We didn’t do it the way 
it used to be done. We kind of eased 
into this, but it has worked very well. 
I commend Liz and John for the work 
they do in holding everyone together in 
making this a reality. 
Where we are right now is, we have 
had a lot of our Members coming to the 
floor. My staff and I are continuing to 
work on the inclusion of additional 
amendments. If you will recall, 2 weeks 
ago, when we took a break for the 
Fourth of July, we agreed upon some 
legislation, some amendments that 
would be a part of this. They are all 
structured right now. We have already 
passed 
two—actually, 
passed 
four 
today. We have another bunch of 
amendments, including a managers’ 
package. It was hotlined today, just 
today. We don’t have the results of 
that yet. People may have objected to 
it, and I am just not aware—appar-
ently, there have been some objections. 
I don’t know what the count is. We will

keep trying to get as many amend-
ments as possible. My experience is 
that this means we are nearing the end 
of the road. 
I would have to say this about my 
partner in this effort—he has been my 
partner for a number of years, JACK 
REED, on the minority side. We have 
both worked hand in glove in trying to 
get as many amendments as possible, 
and we have set a record this year with 
either amendments or letters from 
Members. 
I am going do something that will 
make a bunch of people mad, but I 
don’t really care. You hear so much 
negative stuff. I have said several 
times that when this President came 
in, up to the moment that we had the 
virus, we had the best economy we 
have had in my lifetime. All indica-
tions show that was true. 
He did this in a way that was thought 
out, and it wasn’t all a Republican 
idea. Back when John Kennedy was 
President of the United States, that is 
when they were expanding the Great 
Society. This is a quote. He said: We 
are going to have to have a lot more 
revenue to take care of the Great Soci-
ety programs. The best way to increase 
revenue is to decrease marginal rates— 
marginal tax rates. And it worked. Un-
fortunately, he died right after that 
and could not see the benefits of the ef-
forts of this great idea. 
This was done again during the Bush 
administration. It was the first thing 
that was done by the Trump adminis-
tration. But he did something different 
this time, and this is the reason that it 
produced much more revenue than the 
others had produced in years past. He 
said: We also need to reduce the regula-
tions at the same time. 
I am very sensitive to this because I 
chaired the Environment and Public 
Works Committee during the time the 
Republicans were in the minority. Dur-
ing the Obama administration, we had 
so many regulations, and that had to 
be changed. 
Even the Chair is probably not aware 
that this is a regulation that was 
passed during the Obama administra-
tion, but it is one which said that if 
you are a domestic oil or gas company 
and you are in competition with China 
or somebody else, you have to give 
them your playbook—how you cal-
culated your rates. That put them at a 
decided advantage. 
When I was fortunate enough to get 
to know this President, prior to the 
time he took office, I was suggesting 
and he was saying: What would be a 
good place to start in reducing regula-
tions? 
I said: A good one would be to do 
away with that regulation that was 
passed. 
I think it was only a week after he 
took office that we passed the first reg-
ulation. That is just one example. But 
then regulation after regulation after 
regulation—those 
of 
us 
who 
have 
grown up in the business world know 
that is what costs money. And liberals 
have never figured that out. 
Anyway, this has happened. As a re-
sult of this, we have had really great 
benefits. I bring this up now because— 
put the Johnson family up. This is a 
family in Oklahoma. It is the Johnson 
family, Charlie Johnson. He has several 
brothers, and he has a son named An-
drew. They are in the tree business. 
They find people who want to get rid of 
dead trees, unwanted trees, and they 
get rid of the trees. They are the best 
there are. They have been doing it now 
very competitively and doing it for 
years. 
When he came to take a tree out dur-
ing the 2 weeks—I am talking about 
less than 2 weeks ago—he said: We can 
do this, but I want to tell you that we 
are really busy now. In fact, our busi-
ness is better than it has ever been in 
the history of our country. It is all be-
cause of what has happened with the 
President. 
These are his words. He said: I know 
everybody hates the President. The 
media hates the President. But we love 
him, and let me tell you why. We are 
now doing better than we have ever 
done before. Our business is better than 
it ever has been. 
He has a brother who specialized— 
when you are in the tree business, you 
specialize. If you look, you can’t see 
the bucket, but the son is in the buck-
et. Another one is the guy who has de-
veloped a way of grinding stumps. Al-
most anyone can take a tree out, but 
to grind a stump, you have to have 
very expensive equipment. 
A few days after I had seen these peo-
ple, I got a visit by a guy named Brad 
Johnson. Brad is the one who special-
izes in stump grinding. He said: Our 
business is so good now—and they all 
credit the President with this—our 
business is so good that I decided I 
would go off on my own and buy a 
stump grinder. It is very, very expen-
sive. No one ever thought it would be, 
but it is. Now I think he owns the only 
stump grinder in Delaware County in 
Oklahoma. 
He said: I want you to do something. 
I know you will be going back to Wash-
ington. I am going to give you this, and 
I want you to give this to the President 
of the United States. 
It says: ‘‘Brad’s stump grinding.’’ I 
am going to give this to the President 
of the United States and take his pic-
ture. 
I only say all this to mention that 
good things are happening around here. 
Things had not been this good, except 
for the virus problem. No one had any 
control over that in terms of the Presi-
dent. When I stop and think about how 
good our economy was right before the 
virus hit, I think: If we had an average 
economy, where would we be today? 
Anyway, that was the good news, and 
I was excited to tell them I was going 
to share this with a few other people. 
Earlier today, I mentioned I would be 
coming down to the floor to talk about 
our troop basing in Germany. Those of 
us on the committee know we have 
been working on this for a long time. 
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was 
putting something together where he 
was going around and reevaluating our 
troop and asset distribution around the 
world. I disagree with some of the 
things he came up with. 
Africa, for example, is an area where 
they are starting to have some very se-
rious problems. If anything, it is going 
to end up taking more activity. Along 
with other Members, I will be receiving 
detailed briefings from the Department 
of Defense on plans to carry out the 
President’s decision in the coming days 
and weeks. 
Based on my conversation with Sec-
retary Esper and the briefings I have 
received so far, the goal is to optimize 
our force posture in Europe, in part by 
moving some of our forces along 
NATO’s eastern flank. It has always 
been in Western Europe. Going for-
ward, as I think about the plan to re-
align our posture in Europe, I am 
thinking about the three guiding prin-
ciples that I call the ‘‘3 Fs.’’ 
First is the forward presence—main-
taining a strong presence in Europe 
that gives our troops what they need to 
deter Russia and, if necessary, to fight 
and win and defeat Russia. I like the 
idea of rotational forces in southeast 
Europe. 
The second one is force protection. 
Really, force projection is more accu-
rate. It is keeping strong, established 
bases for staging, air capacity, and 
more. For example, at Ramstein Air 
Force Base, we have invested quite a 
lot of money in that. It is going to 
work for any future use in readjust-
ments that take place in Europe. What 
I am saying is a lot of things are going 
on in Europe that are going to be en-
hanced, as opposed to being trans-
ferred. 
The third is families. This is kind of 
interesting. Take our Air Force in Tin-
ker Air Force Base. There is a young 
lady who is the wife of a worker at Tin-
ker Air Force Base. Her name is Janna 
Driver. This was 2 years ago. She told 
me that we have a problem at Tinker. 
When we privatized our housing, it 
worked out fine for a long period of 
time, but then it seemed to be that 
people got greedy in the housing. They 
talked about deplorable conditions in 
housing. I thought: My gosh, this is my 
home State of Oklahoma. Thank good-
ness it is just one military establish-
ment. 
Then I found out it was in all five of 
our military establishments. Then I 
found out it wasn’t just in Oklahoma. 
It was around the world. 
This is something that is very sig-
nificant because when you look at the 
problems that they have with so many 
people—and I will be addressing this in 
a little more detail in a minute be-
cause of the amendment that will be 
before us tomorrow—the problem is 
that we do something different than 
other countries do. I have heard this 
over and over, and I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer has also heard. 
We talk about all the money we 
spend on defense in the United States,

and yet we spend more money than 
Russia and China put together. They 
are our strategic oppositions out there. 
That is true because the most expen-
sive part of the military is the people. 
People don’t understand that. We want 
housing, and we want to make sure 
there are schools for the kids. We want 
to make sure all these things are going 
on. That is what costs the money. That 
is the reason. 
If you are in a communist country, 
they give you a gun and say: Go out 
and kill people—and the problem is 
solved. 
We are concerned about our families. 
They make a lot of sacrifices. Every 
few years, our families have to move, 
change locations, and the kids have to 
change schools. They move to another 
area. Then, if the spouse has a job, 
they have to try to get a job. 
By the way, in this bill we have some 
help. We get relief from some of the 
regulations that normally take a long 
period of time, so that spouses are able 
to get a job at a new location. That is 
something a lot of people are not aware 
of that is in this great bill. 
They have to change hometowns, 
change houses, change doctors, and the 
kids change schools. Of course, they 
live with the reality that their service-
member is putting their life on the line 
to defend our country. We have to be 
grateful and never take that sacrifice 
for granted. That is why we should be 
trying to ease the burden of our mili-
tary families in everything we do. 
When it comes to this plan we are 
talking about, which is changing the 
forces around, primarily in Europe, 
that is what you hear more about. It is 
important that we do it right and we 
do it right away. It is going to take 
some time to do, but we need to get 
started. 
The reason I am really excited about 
this program is that this is not some-
thing new. If I have good memories, 
you might remember back when Gen. 
Jim Jones was the Supreme Allied 
Commander of NATO at that time. I 
had gone to him and said: You know, 
one thing we really need to be doing is 
to start readjusting where we have our 
troops. 
At that time, we had a lot of troops, 
as we do today, in Germany and a lot 
of training was taking place there. But 
because of the environmental move-
ment in Germany, they were giving us 
restrictions, saying you can only train 
with live ordnance maybe every 4 days 
a week and not past sunset and all of 
that. 
We were thinking that we were really 
doing a great thing for Germany by 
stationing all our people over there be-
cause of all the money they spend and 
all that. Yet they are not really trying 
to help us. 
We did some surveying. This is kind 
of funny because John Bonsell, the 
staff director of my committee on the 
Republican side, and I went over to the 
different countries—Bulgaria, Poland, 
and other different countries in that 
part of the world, in the eastern part of 
Europe. We said: Are you willing to 
help us out? They said: Not only can 
you use your ordnances as much as you 
want, but at the same time, we will 
help billet you and all that. 
The program was good and strongly 
supported by Gen. Jim Jones at that 
time. 
We did all we could to put that to-
gether, and we were visiting our allies 
about it. We already had Ukraine, Bul-
garia and Romania lined up. They call 
that the lily pad approach to basic. It 
was something that would work. There 
is no reason not to do that. 
Unfortunately, President Bush de-
cided he didn’t want to do it. We were 
unsuccessful getting that done. I have 
been fighting about that with other 
Presidents since that time. I have not 
gotten any of them to look at that and 
the great values that would make for 
us. 
Anyway, that is something that is 
taking place right now. We don’t know, 
but we are going to get a Member brief-
ing tomorrow that is going to give us a 
lot of details on what is going to hap-
pen and what the President is pro-
posing in that area of Europe. 
I want to speak about one of the 
amendments that is next up. Senator 
SANDERS’ amendment would cut de-
fense spending by 10 percent. I happen 
to be very close with Senator SANDERS, 
but we have areas where we disagree 
with each other. This is one of those 
areas. I looked at this, and I thought: 
He has an amendment that would cut 
defense spending by 10 percent. 
First of all, this amendment would 
break the bipartisan budget agreement 
of 2019 that we passed. Congress passed 
this agreement last December with a 
bipartisan support, and the President 
signed it into law. The fiscal year 2021 
NDAA, or National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act—the bill that we are working 
on right now, as we speak—fulfills this 
agreement and provides a total of $740.5 
billion for our national defense. I would 
have preferred to see a higher number 
at that time, but it is now the law of 
the land. 
Even though the amount is lower 
than ideal, having budgetary certainty 
is critical. It is what our military lead-
ers ask for every time they come before 
the committee that I chair and before 
Senator SHELBY’s committee. They 
need on-time, predictable, and stable 
funding to do their job. And their jobs 
are only getting harder right now. Our 
adversaries are investing in their mili-
taries and building new and advanced 
weapons systems and acting more ag-
gressively than we have ever seen be-
fore in any of our adversaries. 
The national defense strategy de-
scribes this. This is a document, by the 
way, that we adhered to. This is put to-
gether by six Republicans and six 
Democrats. It is one of these things 
where it was bipartisan. Everyone 
agreed on it. People who put this to-
gether were experts, and we have fol-
lowed it to the letter ever since that 
time. 
This is the National Defense Strat-
egy Commission report, which is a bi-
partisan 
document 
written 
by 
six 
Democrats and six Republicans. They 
tell us that we need to increase our de-
fense budget each year. We already 
know we need to be increasing our 
budget just to stay competitive. We 
have already agreed to this total. 
Now, one of the criticisms I hear of 
our defense budget is that we pay much 
more than other countries. As I have 
already explained, we are the ones who 
have to pay to take care of our peo-
ple—our troops, their families, their 
kids. Here is the problem with that ar-
gument: Other countries don’t have to 
do that. 
Beyond the troops, we also take care 
of the families and all that, while oth-
ers don’t do that. 
This is significant. China and Russia 
are rapidly modernizing their mili-
taries. When I say this in public and I 
talk to groups, I don’t have credibility. 
It doesn’t sound like it is possible. 
I don’t say this critically of the 
Obama administration. The Obama ad-
ministration, by his own admission, 
had other priorities. One of them 
wasn’t a strong military. During the 
last 5 years—and I am talking about 
2010 to 2015, during those last 5 years of 
using the President’s budget, he de-
creased the amount of money for our 
military by 25 percent. In 5 years, he 
decreased it by 25 percent. At the same 
time, Russia increased theirs by 34 per-
cent, and China increased theirs by 83 
percent. 
Stop and think about that. Our ad-
versaries were out there building and 
getting ahead of us in different areas. 
It is important to note that the bill ex-
empts military pay and the defense 
health program, which means this 
amendment is actually the equivalent 
to a 14-percent cut. I am talking about 
cuts in airplanes and equipment and 
assets that are military assets. This 
means the nuclear modernization and 
key research that help us stay com-
petitive with Russia. This is something 
that arguably cannot be done. 
It means cuts to military construc-
tion, including schools for military 
kids, programs that support military 
families, and programs that support 
our troops’ morale and welfare. It is 
just plain wrong. 
Our military combat commanders 
tell me and the committee that they 
need on-time, predictable, and stable 
funding to do their jobs. This amend-
ment would actually cut that by 14 per-
cent in the areas that concern people. 
In the strongest possible terms, I urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. 
All this is going to happen while we 
continue to face the burden that a pan-
demic has placed on our military. Our 
military is a key part of the whole-of- 
government response to the virus. 
Our competitors haven’t given us a 
free pass while this is all happening. In 
fact, we have seen China and Russia 
take advantage of this situation, and

they have been acting more aggres-
sively. At the same time, the Depart-
ment of Defense is working to protect 
our troops and the civilian workforce 
from the virus, and this needs to con-
tinue to be a top priority. Everyone un-
derstands that. In fact, rather than 
cutting the defense budget, we actually 
need to support the military COVID re-
sponse with additional funding. 
Take this one example. The defense 
industrial companies have done a great 
job to ensure that their suppliers—pri-
marily thousands of small businesses— 
stay open and keep employees paid. 
In the CARES Act, we gave the DOD 
the authority and the tools to reim-
burse these companies to keep the de-
fense workforce strong, but the DOD 
needs money to use these tools. If we 
don’t help these companies, defense 
weapons programs and maintenance 
will suffer more cost overruns, and the 
defense industrial base will lose experi-
enced 
and 
trained 
workers, 
which 
means schedule delays will be more 
likely. These will be primarily the 
small companies. These will not be the 
giants that are out there. 
This would be a good investment for 
our national defense and a good invest-
ment for the American taxpayer. Now 
is simply not the time to be cutting 
our defense budget when we should be 
doing more. I know the author of the 
bill who would cut defense spending by 
10 percent is very sincere and really be-
lieves in his bill, but it is not the time 
to do it. 
I hope people understand that we are 
now in a position wherein there are ac-
tually different resources that are in 
Russia and in China that are better 
than ours. Hypersonic weapons are a 
good example. Hypersonic weapons are 
kind of state-of-the-art in both offense 
and defense, and they are ahead of us. 
They are ahead of us right now. 
With this budget we are going to be 
passing, I think that we are going to be 
making broad steps to recapture those 
areas in which we had previously been 
the leaders but now are not the leaders 
any longer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT AND FAFSA 
SIMPLIFICATION ACT 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 
March, Congress and the President said 
to 43 million student loan borrowers 
that, because of COVID–19, your stu-
dent loan payments will be deferred 
until October 1—no monthly payments 
for 6 months for student loan bor-
rowers. 
October 1 is just around the corner. 
So what do we say to those 43 million 
student loan borrowers today? I pro-
pose that we say this: 
No. 1, if there is no income, there is 
no monthly payment. In other words, if 
you have a student loan, your monthly 
payment is zero—if you don’t have any 
income for whatever reason. 
No. 2, when you do begin earning in-
come, your monthly payment will 
never be more than 10 percent of your 
income after you deduct the necessities 
of life, such as the cost of housing— 
rent or mortgage—and food. 
No. 3, the same generous loan for-
giveness that exists today for student 
loan borrowers will still exist. After 20 
years of payments for undergraduate 
loans and 25 years of payments for 
graduate loans, if you still have an out-
standing loan balance, your loan will 
be forgiven, and that will include all of 
the months your payment was zero be-
cause you didn’t have any income. 
These same policies—no income, no 
monthly payment—will be offered to 
students who take out new loans in ad-
dition to these policies being offered to 
existing student loan borrowers. 
Under my proposal, new and existing 
student loan borrowers will be offered 
one other option for paying back their 
loans. This option would be like a 10- 
year mortgage: Make equal principal 
and interest monthly payments over 10 
years until the loan is paid off. Some 
borrowers may prefer this option be-
cause it could mean paying less inter-
est. Every borrower would be eligible 
to switch from one option—the income- 
based payment—to the other option. 
The remaining good news in this pro-
posal is that the concurrent bewil-
dering system of nine different ways of 
paying off your student loan would be 
thrown in the trash heap and replaced 
by these two straightforward pro-
posals: No. 1, the income-based repay-
ment option, and No. 2, the 10-year, 
mortgage-like option. These changes 
will give some peace of mind to the 43 
million current borrowers and the tens 
of millions of Americans who are ex-
pected to sign up for new student loans 
over the next 10 years. 
These ideas are neither new nor my 
ideas. They have been recommended by 
higher education experts numerous 
times when having testified before the 
Senate Education Committee during 
the past 6 years while we have consid-
ered reauthorizing the Higher Edu-
cation Act. The concepts have also 
been suggested by many Senators on 
both sides of the aisle, Democrats and 
Republicans, including Senators KING, 
BURR, RUBIO, MERKLEY, PORTMAN, WAR-
NER, WICKER, MANCHIN, SHAHEEN, and 
COLLINS. All of them have suggested 
these concepts. 
While we are simplifying the student 
loan repayment system, I propose that 
we also finish the job of reducing the 
Federal loan application of grants and 
loans—which everyone calls FAFSA— 
from about 108 questions to 20 to 33 
questions. This is an enterprise that a 
number of us, both Democrats and Re-
publicans, have been working on for 
years, 
including 
Senators 
MURRAY, 
BENNET, JONES, KING, COLLINS, WHITE-
HOUSE, GARDNER, CORNYN, STABENOW, 
TILLIS, and HASSAN. So, you see, there 
is an unusual amount of bipartisan 
support for both of these ideas. 
Experts before the Senate Education 
Committee have testified that simpli-
fying the FAFSA in this way would re-
move obstacles and would make it easi-
er for more low-income Americans to 
attend college and would increase the 
number of Pell grants each year. 
Last fall, Congress and the President 
took the first step in simplifying the 
FAFSA by allowing the Internal Rev-
enue Service to answer 22 questions 
that applicants for grants and loans 
had already answered on their tax re-
turns. 
There are 20 million American fami-
lies who struggle to fill out this essen-
tial but unnecessarily complex form 
each year who will be grateful to Con-
gress if we will complete the job of 
simplifying the Federal aid application 
system at the same time we will make 
it simpler for 43 million Americans to 
pay back their student loans. 
There is one more piece of good news 
in this proposal, and this news is for 
the American taxpayer. Simplifying 
the student loan repayment system, as 
well as the system for applying for stu-
dent grants and loans, will save tax-
payers about $10 billion over 10 years, 
according to the Congressional Budget 
Office. This is because the simpler sys-
tem will also provide more certainty in 
the repayment of loans. 
On October 1, 43 million Americans 
with student loans are going to have to 
restart making their monthly student 
loan repayments. Congress deferred 
student loan payments in March, as I 
said earlier, when the CARES Act—the 
COVID–19 relief bill—was signed into 
law, but that deferment expires on Sep-
tember 30. There has never been a more 
important time to end the maddening 
complexity of student loan repayment 
and make it simpler for Americans to 
pay off their student loans. 
Let me briefly review how the Stu-
dent Loan Repayment and FAFSA 
Simplification Act will work. It offers 
student loan borrowers just two op-
tions: the standard 10-year repayment 
plan, just like a mortgage, or the in-
come-based plan that I have described. 
For borrowers with no income, if they 
choose an income-based repayment 
plan, their monthly payments would be 
zero. If borrowers in an income-based 
repayment plan earn income, the bor-
rowers’ monthly payments would be 
based on the amounts of those incomes. 
Let’s take an example. The average 
student loan for a 4-year college grad-
uate today is about $30,000. So someone 
with $30,000 in student loan debt who 
makes $52,000 each year would be ex-
pected to pay 10 percent of that bor-
rower’s discretionary income, which is 
about $274 per month. So if you have a 
$30,000 loan debt and you make $52,000 a 
year, your monthly payment is going 
to be about $274 under this plan. Bor-
rowers under the plan would never 
have to pay more than 10 percent of

their income that is not needed for ne-
cessities. 
If we don’t pass this legislation be-
fore October 1, here is what will hap-
pen: Because of the confusing repay-
ment system we have today, too many 
borrowers 
will 
end 
up 
in 
an 
unaffordable, standard 10-year repay-
ment, mortgage-type plan and will 
have payments so high that they will 
find themselves in default. When we 
are through with this pandemic—when 
the economy improves and when these 
borrowers are ready to tackle their 
debts—they will find that their student 
loan debts may have soared out of con-
trol. 
I and Senator MURRAY of Washington 
State, who is the ranking Democrat on 
our committee, have been working on 
reauthorizing the Higher Education 
Act for nearly 6 years. We have held 19 
hearings over that time. We are mak-
ing good progress. In fact, I was hope-
ful we could mark up the bill this 
spring, but between impeachment and 
COVID, that just didn’t work out. 
In January, I saw a consensus emerg-
ing. It was for simpler, effective regu-
lations to make it easier for students 
to pay for college and to pay back their 
loans. We discussed the complexity of 
the Federal financial aid system. We 
heard from many experts. At one 
roundtable, the president of the Uni-
versity of Tennessee told me it took 
him months to figure out how to pay 
off his daughter’s Federal student 
loan—this was from a college presi-
dent—even with the money in his hand. 
So this is not a new problem, and the 
solution I am proposing has been dis-
cussed by our committee and many 
Senators outside the committee for 
nearly 6 years. It will help both those 
who face loan payments starting on Oc-
tober 1 and the millions of students 
who will be graduating with student 
debt. 
When it comes time to start repaying 
those loans, students will have to navi-
gate through a complicated number of 
options today—nine in total. I don’t 
want to go through them in detail be-
cause it would stagger the imagina-
tion. For example, there is the 10-year 
standard repayment. There is the grad-
uated standard repayment. There are 
two extended repayment options. There 
are five different programs based on 
your income: the income-contingent 
repayment, the original income-based 
repayment, the revised income-based 
repayment, the pay-as-you-earn plan, 
and the revised pay-as-you-earn repay-
ment. Those are all of the different 
ways you can pay off your student 
loans, which has confused the 43 mil-
lion borrowers who have them. 
Now, if I lost you wandering through 
that, you can get a sense of how those 
43 million borrowers must feel. 
The Student Loan Repayment and 
FAFSA Simplification Act ends that 
confusion. It will reduce those nine re-
payment 
plans 
down 
to 
two—one 
standard payment, like a mortgage, 
and one payment based on income. 
In addition, the bill reduces the com-
plexity for borrowers who wish to par-
ticipate in the Public Service Loan 
Forgiveness Program, which creates an 
incentive for borrowers to pursue jobs 
in public service. 
Today, not all of the nine current re-
payment plans are eligible for public 
loan forgiveness, and borrowers can 
have a hard time figuring out which 
plan to choose. Under this legislation, 
a borrower who wants loan forgiveness 
can’t choose the wrong plan because 
there are only two and either applies, 
whether you choose the standard 10- 
year repayment plan or the income- 
based repayment plan. 
By the end of September, in less than 
3 months, 43 million student loan bor-
rowers will be required by law to begin 
monthly payments again on their 
loans. Many of these borrowers won’t 
be able to afford these payments. 
I propose that we say to those bor-
rowers: We have a better option for 
you. No income, no monthly payment— 
whether because of COVID–19 or for 
any other reason. In other words, if you 
have a student loan, you may defer 
your monthly payment if you do not 
have any income. When you do begin 
earning income, your monthly pay-
ment will never be more than 10 per-
cent of your income after you deduct 
the necessities of life, such as the cost 
of 
housing—rent 
or 
mortgage—and 
food. 
Now is the time to reduce the com-
plexity of student loan debt and finish 
the job of simplifying the FAFSA and 
at the same time save the taxpayers 
money.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2457 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
when, in the course of time, America 
should find a President in the Oval Of-
fice who chooses to bring the police 
tactics of dictators around the world to 
the streets of America, then that is the 
moment it is incumbent on every Mem-
ber of this Chamber, who has sworn an 
oath to our Constitution, who is deter-
mined to practice civil rights of Amer-
ica, to stand up and say: Not now, not 
here, not ever, and we put an end to it. 
That is why I brought forth this 
amendment—the Stop Secret Policing 
in America amendment—and ask for it 
to be debated on this bill, because it in-
volves police powers, military powers 
of the United States of America, and it 
is happening right now. 
What am I talking about? Well, let 
me give you some sense of what we 
have seen on the streets of America in 
the past few days—as I note here, au-
thoritarian governments, not demo-
cratic republics, and unmarked au-
thorities at the protests. Well, this is 
what we saw: Customs and Border Pro-
tection in military uniform, in combat 
camouflage, in the streets, no marking 
what the organization is and no unique 
identifier. 
The head of the CBP said: No, no. 
They had markings and unique identi-
fiers. But here they are. And to make 
it even worse, they look a whole lot 
like protesters from the far right who 
come to make trouble, dressed in cam-
ouflage, and they actually have things 
that look more like badges than the ac-
tual representatives of Customs and 
Border Protection. 
What else did we see? Here is a Navy 
veteran standing in the street, who 
said he came down to the protest to 
simply say: Are you honoring your 
oath to the Constitution? 
Here we have CBP officers beating 
him. Here is one baton. Here is an-
other. They broke one of his bones, 
while this man here is pepper-sprayed 
in the face—a peaceful protester stand-
ing, being attacked by unmarked, war- 
prepared, dressed-in-camouflage forces 
deployed by the President of the 
United States. 
What else happened? Well, they de-
cided to not consult with the city and 
not consult with the State and not 
think carefully about what weapons 
they were carrying and how they use 
them, so impact munitions. 
This protestor right here in the sil-
houette is standing, and he is holding 
what appears to be a sign above his 
head, or maybe it is a radio. Moments 
later in the video that shows this, he is 
shot down. You see him collapse on the 
street. A peaceful protestor, standing, 
making his case as guaranteed by the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America, and he is shot square between 
the eyes by President Trump’s forces 
deployed without permission and no co-
ordination with the local representa-
tives or the Governor of the State of 
Oregon. This young man, struck down, 
shot in the head, in the hospital in 
critical condition. He is doing better 
now, thankfully. 
Then these forces deploy away from 
the Federal buildings and go into the

streets and start snatching protestors 
and throwing them into unmarked 
vans—vans like this one right here. 
One young man said: I was terrified. 
He said: I didn’t know who these people 
were. They wouldn’t identify them-
selves. There is a video of people say-
ing: Who are you all? And they won’t 
answer. They grab him. He thinks they 
might be those folks from the right-
wing protesters who come in camou-
flage. He may be being kidnapped. He 
doesn’t know. Even after he is thrown 
into a jail cell, it is not explained why 
they grabbed him off the street. 
Secret police—unmarked—patrolling 
streets, throwing people into unmarked 
vehicles, and sweeping them away— 
that is what you get from authori-
tarian dictators, not a country, a re-
public where we have a constitution 
and we have rights. 
That is what is going on here. That is 
what has to stop here in America. 
Some of the headlines: Federal law 
enforcement use unmarked vehicles to 
grab protesters off the streets. A Navy 
vet asked Federal officers in Portland 
to remember their oaths; they broke 
his hand. 
That is the Navy vet in the white 
sweatshirt who is being attacked, with 
two officers batoning him while an-
other sprays him with pepper spray for 
standing in a peaceful protest. 
Federal officers deployed in Portland 
didn’t have proper training, DHS says. 
Well, they shouldn’t have been there. 
We need a bill to stop secret police in 
America. We need a bill done as an 
amendment on this bill right now, on 
this bill we are considering about mili-
tary force, a bill that says that your 
organization has to be identified on a 
uniform; that says there has to be a 
unique identifier so you don’t think 
you can just get away with anything 
and abuse people and never be held ac-
countable; a bill that says that if you 
are there on a mission to defend monu-
ments or buildings, you defend monu-
ments or buildings; you don’t go out 
through the streets—if you want to be-
come crowd control in the streets and 
take over a city, you have to have the 
permission of the mayor or the permis-
sion of the Governor; and that the Fed-
eral Government, in transparency, in 
our democracy, has to tell us all, as 
participants, as this we-the-people gov-
ernment, that they are disclosing how 
many people, from where, are being 
sent to what city. 
This isn’t just some small issue. This 
is the President saying yesterday— 
after bragging about what he has done 
in Portland to violate the rights of peo-
ple—saying he is looking at New York 
and Chicago and Philadelphia and De-
troit and Baltimore and Oakland—de-
ploying these secret police tactics all 
over this country. 
All I do right now is stand here and 
say: I want a vote on ending these se-
cret police practices in America. I say 
to every Republican colleague and 
every Democratic colleague: I want a 
vote, and I am here in full partnership 
with my colleague from Oregon who 
shares this indignation, this outrage 
over the violation of the Constitution, 
who will share those thoughts, and 
then we will, together, ask to have a 
vote. 
What is this Chamber if it cannot 
take on and hold a debate and a discus-
sion over authoritarian, secret policing 
strategies brought to the streets of 
America? 
My colleague. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague this afternoon be-
cause he speaks today with passion and 
facts and clearly outlines what our 
constituents told us at home this past 
week, and I thank him for this partner-
ship that Oregonians are seeing again 
on the floor of this great Senate. 
Madam President, Donald Trump has 
deployed a paramilitary squad to our 
hometown in Portland. His secret po-
lice are terrorizing my friends and 
neighbors. People across the country 
need to understand that yesterday 
Donald Trump announced to America 
that your friends and your neighbors 
are next. 
There are unmarked vans full of 
armed men in military gear snatching 
people off the streets. They take people 
away. They hold them. They interro-
gate them without justification and ul-
timately without charges. 
Over the weekend, a very close per-
sonal friend, Sharon Meieran, an ER 
doctor and a mom, was protesting 
peacefully and was tear-gassed without 
provocation. She felt like she was see-
ing democracy pass right in front of 
her eyes. 
Millions of Americans have seen the 
video of that local Navy veteran who 
was repeatedly beaten and pepper- 
sprayed and left with broken bones. 
People ask me: RON, what was his of-
fense? 
I am sure Senator MERKLEY gets ex-
actly the same question: What did he 
do wrong? 
He was standing motionless, hands 
by his side, speaking up for the liberty 
that he served to protect. People are 
stunned that this is happening on the 
streets of our hometowns. We have 
seen reports of agents ripping a mask 
off of a protester who is obeying com-
mands, with hands in the air, only to 
pepper spray the protester’s face. The 
secret police even threw flash bombs 
and tear gas at a ‘‘wall of moms.’’ Here 
they are. Here they are in our home-
town. You can see them, over the last 
couple of days: Moms and dads and now 
their kids are going to peacefully sing 
songs and protest for justice. 
Oregonians are just standing up for 
what is right. Only the cowards of the 
Trump administration would try to 
convince America that these peaceful 
protesters, the ‘‘wall of moms,’’ rep-
resent some kind of anarchist threat. 
It is nonsense. 
I condemn violence by anybody—al-
ways—and I spent much of last week 
working for nonviolent solutions in my 
hometown and fresh approaches to re-
duce tensions on our streets. The fact 
is, the protests in Portland have been 
overwhelmingly 
peaceful. 
Crime 
in 
Portland and across Oregon was down 
before Donald Trump sent in his secret 
police. 
Donald Trump did not send that 
paramilitary force to keep people safe. 
Donald Trump is doing it to create an 
image of chaos, to air it on far-right 
television, scare the country, turn 
them into campaign ads, but these are 
the people Senator MERKLEY and I are 
honored to represent. These are the 
people Donald Trump’s paramilitary 
forces attacked and terrorized. He calls 
it a ‘‘great success.’’ As we have indi-
cated, he has a game plan to basically 
make Portland an experiment and to 
do it in other cities, especially, by his 
accounts, those with Democratic lead-
ership and voters. 
This kind of abusive exercise of 
power by a rogue President would have 
horrified our Founding Fathers. They 
wrote a wonderful Constitution to pre-
vent exactly this behavior because de-
mocracy cannot survive in a nation 
that tolerates it. These tactics were 
used throughout the world a century 
ago to turn elected politicians into ty-
rants. 
The President’s first and most impor-
tant job is to keep Americans safe. 
Residents of Portland are less safe and 
less secure since Donald Trump de-
ployed the secret police to our streets. 
The same thing—and I say this to col-
leagues wherever you are from—the 
same things will happen in your com-
munities where Donald Trump will 
send his paramilitary forces. 
Frankly, when Donald Trump always 
talks about targeting Portland and 
other cities, I say to Senator MERKLEY, 
I wish he would target the coronavirus. 
I wish he would put a fraction of his 
passion for going after our cities into 
dealing with the coronavirus because 
while Donald Trump’s secret police are 
out terrorizing Portland’s moms and 
doctors and other peaceful protesters, 
we face a raging pandemic and record- 
high unemployment. 
I want us to renew the supercharged 
unemployment benefits that people are 
going to lose this weekend. Donald 
Trump isn’t doing any of that work. 
What he is doing is making Americans 
in cities less safe and not dealing with 
the coronavirus on top of it. He is at-
tempting to cut resources for COVID 
testing and treatment. His administra-
tion is covering up data that the public 
health professionals rely on to do their 
job. He does it repeatedly, anxious to 
cut the lifelines of 30 million jobless 
Americans, sending them tumbling off 
an economic cliff right in the middle of 
the worst economic crisis since the 
Great Depression. 
He is not doing his job. He is ignoring 
his responsibilities. Both on the streets 
of Portland and in Washington, DC, 
when he walks away from dealing with 
the 
coronavirus, 
he 
isn’t 
keeping 
Americans safe. He is putting them in 
more danger.

As I have said repeatedly, Donald 
Trump ought to attack the coronavirus 
pandemic and not the people of Port-
land. So that is why, very shortly, Sen-
ator MERKLEY
and I will offer an 
amendment that will block Donald 
Trump from using these paramilitary 
forces in Portland or other cities where 
they are unwanted. 
What we are seeing in our hometowns 
is these paramilitary squads brutally 
unleashed against peaceful protesters— 
moms and veterans, doctors and activ-
ists. All they want to do is speak out 
for liberty and justice. 
What Donald Trump is now doing is 
incompatible with the fundamental 
principles of democracy laid out by our 
Founders and expanded throughout the 
generations. I believe what Donald 
Trump is doing, in light of his state-
ment yesterday, to America, that he is 
going to go after one city after an-
other, is totally out of control. The 
Senate cannot allow this to happen. 
That is why Senator MERKLEY and I 
are calling for the Senate to act. 
I thank my friend and colleague for 
his leadership. He has made it clear 
that 100 percent of Oregon’s U.S. Sen-
ators are going to keep pushing and 
fighting until this changes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. The support is felt 
strongly throughout Oregon to stop the 
secret police in America, but it is a 
coast-to-coast feeling, and I yield to 
my colleague from Connecticut to 
speak for the other side of the country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank from my heart 
our two colleagues from Oregon who 
are standing up and championing not 
just their hometowns, not just the con-
stituents of their State, but they are 
speaking for every hometown and 
every citizen of our country from every 
party, from every corner of our great 
Nation. 
Let me just say very simply, these 
pictures of heavily armed, unidentified 
individuals 
in 
camouflage 
fatigues 
driving unmarked vehicles, grabbing 
individuals and throwing them into 
their car, would be something we would 
associate with the worst nightmare of 
a two-bit dictatorship. Here we see it 
in the United States of America. 
I spent almost my whole career in 
law enforcement before I came to this 
body, 
and 
I 
am 
embarrassed 
and 
ashamed that this kind of sadistic, 
cruel, hate-filled coup was done in the 
name of law enforcement. What we wit-
nessed in Oregon was in no way law en-
forcement. It was a violation of the law 
and of individual rights, and it is com-
ing to your hometown as well. The 
President has specifically named Chi-
cago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, 
and Oakland. It will come to Hartford 
and my hometown Stanford and other 
cities in Connecticut. Have no fear, if 
the President will go to these abusive 
extremes on the other coast of Amer-
ica, he will come to the east coast as 
well. 
Let me just state the requirements of 
this amendment: identification of each 
officer, limiting Federal agents to 
their proper role in protecting Federal 
property, transparency and deployment 
of 
these 
officers, 
identification 
of 
them, and accountability are basic te-
nets of law enforcement. 
We should not have to address this 
issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
and we are doing it only because the 
President has broken the norms. He 
has disrespected the law. Every Sen-
ator in this body, regardless of party, 
should be standing up and speaking out 
in support of this amendment. I thank 
my colleague for speaking our truth to 
power. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. On behalf of two Or-
egon Senators and my colleague from 
Connecticut and the 34 other Senators 
who are standing up for democracy, 
rights, and against secret police, I ask 
unanimous consent to call up amend-
ment No. 2457, an amendment to limit 
Federal law enforcement officers for 
crowd control; that there be 2 hours for 
debate, equally divided between oppo-
nents and proponents; that upon dis-
position of the Tester amendment, the 
Senate vote in relation to the amend-
ment, with no amendments in order 
prior to the vote and with all other 
provisions under the previous order re-
maining in effect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Well, first of all, I don’t 
know how long I have sat and listened 
to this—a long time—probably not as 
long as it seems. ‘‘Secret police, sadis-
tic, cruel.’’ I am beginning to come to 
the conclusion that they are not going 
to be supporting Donald Trump for re-
election. 
I rise to object to my colleagues’ re-
quest for unanimous consent. This 
body has worked together to carefully 
consider each and every one of the 739 
amendments filed on the NDAA. It 
never happened before. We adopted 
those amendments that have broad- 
based, bipartisan support. The major-
ity and minority have worked together 
to determine which amendments would 
be brought up for a vote. Senator 
MERKLEY’s 
request 
for 
a 
UC 
cir-
cumvents that process. 
Further, this morning, the Senate 
adopted my commonsense amendment 
that will ensure that law enforcement 
has the right equipment and the right 
training. Senator MERKLEY’s amend-
ment flies in the face of that respon-
sible approach. 
His 
amendment 
would 
hamstring 
Federal and civilian law enforcement 
and our military, even when operating 
in a title 32 status under the control of 
the State government. This would 
hinder their ability to keep our com-
munities safe. For these reasons, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I say to my col-
league from Oklahoma, that if these se-
cret police were released on the streets 
of Tulsa, you would be down here de-
fending your constituents, but you 
have a responsibility to defend all con-
stituents across the country, the rights 
of all citizens in the United States of 
America. 
I am not asking you to support my 
bill. I am not asking you to make the 
argument for it. I am asking for the 
simple courtesy that this Chamber do 
the job it is vested with under the Con-
stitution, which is to take up serious 
issues that arise in America, hold a 
dialogue about them on this floor, and 
take a vote to show the American peo-
ple where we stand in the hopes to 
solve the problem. 
I have no doubt that I wouldn’t get 
100 votes. You raise some interesting 
points. You note that my request to de-
bate a very serious issue in America 
circumvents process. I can state that 
for 200 years this Chamber believed it 
was here to address serious issues, and 
they didn’t raise process issues to keep 
serious issues from being debated. You 
didn’t need unanimous consent. Just a 
few decades ago, I was here watching 
this Chamber working the Tax Reform 
Act and watching each amendment 
completed, and as soon as it was done, 
the next Senator asked for the recogni-
tion of the Chair. In fact, normally 
there would be about 10 Senators say-
ing—and it was always ‘‘Mr. Presi-
dent.’’ Now it is often ‘‘Madam Presi-
dent.’’ But they were getting attention 
because the next person who spoke got 
the next amendment. 
This system has taken away the fun-
damental responsibility of Senators to 
be able to introduce important issues 
in America, have them debated, and 
voted on. My colleague says: Well, we 
have a new process where the majority 
leader and the ranking member of the 
committee consult and decide what 
should be considered. That concentra-
tion of power is totally at odds with 
the vision of this Chamber developed 
by our Founders. 
Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. MERKLEY. I will not yield until 
I am done. That was one of his argu-
ments; that it circumvents process. 
The second is, he said it takes equip-
ment away and training away, and yet 
my bill doesn’t deal with equipment or 
training. So, clearly, that argument 
doesn’t stand. 
Then he noted title 32 status under 
the control of the Governor, but this 
bill says an expanded role of crowd con-
trol occurs under the permission of the 
Governor, not without it. 
So this is why these issues should be 
debated on this floor. I call on all my

colleagues to return the Senate to a 
place where serious and important 
issues regarding the rights of Ameri-
cans can be considered and not shoved 
aside because one Member doesn’t want 
them addressed. That is a challenge for 
this Chamber, but we have a bigger 
challenge, which is how do we defend 
the rights of our citizens if we can’t 
put an amendment on the floor and 
have it debated and voted on? 
So, to all my colleagues who believe 
the secret police have no role in Amer-
ica; that unidentified officers, dele-
gated without proper training, without 
consultation, 
without 
coordination, 
who are beating up peaceful protesters 
have no place in America; that they 
are being thrown into a van, and you 
don’t even know what that van is or 
who those people are has no place in 
America; that the tactics of Duterte in 
the Philippines and Putin in Russia 
and Erdogan in Turkey have no place 
in America; who believe in a ‘‘we the 
people’’ government; those colleagues I 
thank, and let’s bring this issue to the 
floor and have the debate and have the 
vote. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS—AMENDMENT NO. 2457 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senators 
ROSEN and HASSAN be added as cospon-
sors to Senate amendment No. 2457, to 
reform Department of Defense to limit 
the use of Federal law enforcement of-
ficers for crowd control, and to S. 4049, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. My apologies to my 
colleague from Wyoming. I think we 
are not in quorum call. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. You are 
not. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS—S. 4220 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senators 
ROSEN and HASSAN be added as cospon-
sors to S. 4220, the Preventing Authori-
tarian Policing Tactics on America’s 
Streets Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss our 
economic recovery. Let me be clear. 
Our economy will not shut down again. 
Government will not forcibly close 
businesses for a second time. 
Yes, America is coming back from 
the 
coronavirus. 
The 
prepandemic 
economy was strong; it was healthy; 
and it was growing. Every part of the 
economy had record job growth. Unem-
ployment was at a 50-year low. Shut-
ting down the economy slowed the 
spread of the virus, but it did not 
eliminate it. It saved lives, and it 
bought us time. 
Reopening was never conditioned on 
having a vaccine, nor was it condi-
tioned on eliminating the virus en-
tirely. Businesses, large and small, are 
today continuing to reopen, and they 
are opening in a safe, scientific, and 
sensible way. I saw it all across Wyo-
ming the last 2 weeks as I traveled the 
State. 
In Casper and Cheyenne, Main Street 
is busy again. Mom-and-pop businesses 
are bringing back workers. Cody was 
full of activity over the Fourth of July. 
Yellowstone is welcoming thousands of 
visitors, and people are heading to all 
of the activities in Thermopolis. The 
rodeos have been a huge success. Wyo-
ming is literally back in the saddle 
again. 
Businesses all over the country are 
bouncing back and bringing back work-
ers. In June, the economy added nearly 
5 million jobs. It shattered all fore-
casts. This was by far the largest ever 
monthly jobs gain in U.S. history. 
More than 7 million people have been 
hired back in the last 2 months. May 
and June job creation set records. 
The recent rise in new COVID–19 
cases, to me, as a doctor, is troubling. 
Still, it is no reason to stop reopening, 
as long as we open in a responsible 
way. 
Now, people have made great sac-
rifices. We all did what the experts said 
we needed to do. Now Americans are 
ready to get back to business and get 
back to work. People don’t want an-
other shutdown, and you know that. 
You have seen that in your own home 
State, and they most assuredly don’t 
want laws coming out of Congress that 
make it easier to stay closed and hard-
er to reopen. As a doctor, I know we 
can flatten the virus curve without 
flattening or flatlining the economy. 
People can resume normal life and stay 
healthy. 
The key, of course, is for all of us to 
do our part and take the proper pre-
cautions, and we know what they are: 
Social distancing, good hygiene, and, of 
course, wearing masks. As a doctor, I 
know masks help lower the infection 
spread, especially indoors when we 
can’t socially distance. Together, we 
can manage the risk, and, as a nation, 
we can move forward. 
Millions of Americans are returning 
to work and doing it safely. Congress’s 
rapid response to the pandemic back in 
March set this recovery in motion. 
Medical workers now have better tools 
for virus testing, for treating the dis-
ease, and for developing a vaccine. 
Americans are doing everything they 
can to protect the most vulnerable. We 
are taking care of seniors and people 
with chronic medical conditions. The 
country is conducting a record number 
of tests. More than 45 million people 
have been tested. I think the number is 
now close to 50 million. There are well 
over 700,000 tests each day. 
Widespread testing allows us to pin-
point virus hotspots so we are able to 
surge aid where it is most needed. Hos-
pitals now have more effective COVID– 
19 treatments. I talked to doctors 
around the State of Wyoming and 
around the country. We are seeing in-
credible progress in vaccine trials. A 
successful vaccine is vital to beating 
the virus. 
Now, it is key to the economic come-
back as well. Scientists hope to have a 
vaccine ready in record time—actually, 
before the end of this calendar year. 
All this progress has given businesses 
the confidence to reopen and to put 
people back to work. A solid majority 
of Americans now will tell you that 
they see their finances as being stable. 
Consumer spending the last 2 months 
has been way up. Manufacturing has 
started to take off again. Simply put, 
the pro-health, pro-jobs policies that 
this Senate has put in place, those poli-
cies are working. We are only getting 
started. 
Now Congress must build on the 
CARES Act successes. The next bill, 
the one that we are working on now, 
cannot be a bloated bailout bonanza. 
We will not pass Speaker PELOSI’s bill 
from Handout Heaven. No, the next aid 
measure must be focused. It must be 
focused on healthcare and safety and 
schools and jobs. 
Here is my three-part test for the 
next pandemic package. Will it save 
lives? Will it save lives with testing, 
treatment, and vaccines? I am very op-
timistic of what I have seen about the 
research with the new vaccine. Will it 
protect our medical community and 
small businesses and schools from friv-
olous lawsuits? There are 3,500 that 
have already been filed across the 
country by sue-and-settle lawyers fo-
cused on coronavirus. And will it get 
people back to work and children back 
to school safely? 
We must help schools reopen in a safe 
way. Children need to get back to 
school. It is essential for their well- 
being. That is why the Nation’s pedia-
tricians—the American Academy of Pe-
diatrics—is urging schools to reopen, 
and they say with the children phys-
ically present—with the children phys-
ically present. Remote learning, we 
know, for very young people, has not 
worked. Children cannot lose another 
year of school. To lose a full year of 
school for these young people would be 
devastating. It would be a learning 
loss, as well as a loss of the ability to 
learn and making it that much harder 
to pick up further down the line. And if 
kids aren’t in school, many parents 
can’t go back to work. Most people 
with their jobs cannot work from 
home. 
So I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, my Democratic col-
leagues, to join us, to join our effort to

reopen our economy and reopen our 
schools. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Presi-
dent, I am proud to talk about the Na-
tional 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act, 
which has come to this body with a 
strong bipartisan vote from the Armed 
Services Committee where I serve. I 
am proud to have helped to craft this 
legislation, and I am proud to be voting 
for some of the amendments that have 
been permitted votes on the floor. 
One that has not been permitted re-
lates to the Insurrection Act, a 213- 
year-old law that has been invoked at 
various points in our history to protect 
civil rights as it was during the era of 
desegregation, but President Trump 
has threatened to use this slavery-era 
law to silence calls for justice from 
Americans protesting centuries of rac-
ist oppression. 
In effect, he has threatened to invert 
the Insurrection Act to deprive Ameri-
cans of their First Amendment right. 
So I introduced a bill called the CIVIL 
Act that would preserve Presidential 
accountability to Congress whenever 
the Insurrection Act is invoked. It 
would require the President to consult 
with Congress prior to invoking the act 
and provide certification to Congress 
to justify the use of this authority. It 
has other provisions. 
It was voted down in the markup of 
the Armed Services Committee, but I 
sought a vote on the floor. Apparently, 
it will not happen. 
If the President uses force against 
Americans at home, Congress should 
demand at least the same check that 
applied to his use of force against ad-
versaries abroad. 
I offered this act as an amendment, 
and I am grateful to all my Democratic 
colleagues on the committee for sup-
porting it. I am also grateful to the 
House of Representatives, which, just 
yesterday, passed an NDAA amend-
ment to its bill modifying the CIVIL 
Act, which I introduced. It is called the 
Curtailing Insurrection Act Violations 
of Individuals’ Liberties. I would like 
to thank my colleagues on the House 
side who supported this amendment, 
particularly Congresswoman ESCOBAR, 
who led the charge in the House Armed 
Services Committee and on the House 
floor. 
I urge our colleagues, whether it is 
now in the course of considering the 
NDAA or at some point in the future, 
to hold the President, any President— 
we are talking not only about this 
President but any President—account-
able when he uses military force 
against Americans. When the American 
military and troops of our country are 
used against Americans, there ought to 
be at least the same accountability as 
when American troops are used abroad, 
with the same kind of checks—maybe 
not identical, but the same kinds of 
checks—because the President using 
troops against our own citizens denies, 
potentially, fundamental freedoms, and 
the need for accountability is even 
more urgent. Our military should de-
fend liberties, not endanger them, mis-
directed by a misguided President. 
Despite my disappointment in the 
Senate’s lack of action to curtail the 
President’s 
unaccountable 
use 
and 
abuse of military power, I am proud of 
a number of provisions that I also au-
thored in this bill that invest in our 
most valuable military asset, our serv-
icemembers and their families. 
I am grateful to all of the military 
spouses and advocates from across the 
country who shared their challenges 
with me and my office. Their stories, 
their voice, and their faces made an 
immensely impactful difference. We 
used their experience to craft these 
overdue policies. 
I want to say to those families—to 
the spouses and loved ones—that they 
serve as much as the men and women 
they support in uniform. 
The NDAA includes important provi-
sions that I championed to hold com-
manders accountable to military fami-
lies, make childcare more affordable, 
expand support for military moms, and 
prevent mental health discrimination. 
These measures are profoundly impor-
tant. 
Provisions I authored with Senator 
KAINE will make childcare more afford-
able by authorizing hardship waivers, 
requiring fee reductions for families 
with more than one child. And the 
NDAA will support those military 
moms by extending TRICARE to in-
clude other kinds of services. 
The Connecticut military industrial 
base will benefit from the increased ex-
penditure and the robust investment in 
two Virginia-class submarines. My pri-
ority during the negotiations on the 
conference committee will be to ad-
vance this cause. 
These provisions for expanding our 
production of submarines and other 
military platforms must also focus on 
our supply base, on the workforce that 
keeps us safe, and on men and women 
who comprise, indeed, the most tal-
ented workforce, using and building 
unmatched 
military 
technology 
to 
keep our countries secure. 
We should keep in mind the families 
of our military and continue fighting 
for even more provisions that enable 
them to continue their great work, but 
these military platforms assure that 
our troops will never have a fair fight— 
that they will always be superior, no 
matter what the terrain or arena or 
the fight. 
I am pleased that the NDAA makes 
robust investments in Connecticut’s in-
dustrial base. I will make as my top 
priority during negotiations of the con-
ference committee to restore full fund-
ing for two submarines, even beyond 
the commitment in this NDAA, to a 
second Virginia-class submarine in this 
budget authorization. 
I was pleased, again, to see action by 
the House, which provides for two fully 
funded Virginia-class submarines in 
the House Armed Services Committee 
version of the NDAA. 
In addition to fully funding the first 
Columbia-class submarine—a historic 
milestone for this program—the Senate 
version added an additional $175 mil-
lion for Columbia-class supplier devel-
opment. The heroes in this story are 
not only the big contractors. They are 
the supply chains—not only the compa-
nies with hundreds of employees but 
the components makers and the parts 
manufacturers that may make tiny 
pieces of the submarine by comparison 
to its massive length. They are all he-
roes of our defense industrial produc-
tion. 
People are the foundation of the sub-
marine industrial base, and this bill 
authorizes an additional $20 million in 
workforce development funding. I will 
seek to expand the supplier develop-
ment program, which provides the kind 
of support that the supply chain needs. 
We must ensure that the final bill 
preserves not only the necessary levels 
of funding for the Virginia-class and 
the Columbia-class submarines but also 
for continued growth of our fifth gen-
eration fighter fleet. It is a key compo-
nent of our national defense. The Sen-
ate version of the NDAA authorizes the 
growth of the F–35 fleet by 93 aircraft, 
including 14 aircraft above the Presi-
dent’s budget request. 
I remain a staunch advocate of the 
CH–53K program. I was happy to see 
the House Appropriations Defense Sub-
committee fund nine CH–53K heli-
copters. I am going to work to ensure 
that the final NDAA also authorizes 
nine helicopters. 
I want to congratulate and thank Si-
korsky, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon 
Technologies, and, again, the many 
suppliers throughout Connecticut that 
contribute to an aerospace program 
second to none in the world. 
Finally, let me talk a little bit about 
the Fair Care for Vietnam Veterans 
Act of 2020. Later this week, we will 
vote on an amendment to the NDAA 
based on a bicameral Fair Care for Vet-
erans Act of 2020. 
In March, I, along with Senator 
TESTER and 30 Senate colleagues, intro-
duced this legislation to require the 
VA to provide benefits for veterans suf-
fering 
from 
bladder 
cancer, 
hypothyroidism, 
Parkinsonism, 
and 
hypertension. 
The National Academy recognizes 
that these illnesses have an association 
with herbicide exposure. It reached 
that conclusion in 2016. Since then, I 
have been fighting, along with many of 
my colleagues, to get the VA to include 
these four conditions as presumptive 
conditions linked to Agent Orange,

only to have this administration’s offi-
cials block us at every turn. 
Despite the scientific proof—the in-
controvertible science that these con-
ditions are linked to Agent Orange— 
and despite more than 83,000 veterans 
who suffer from these conditions, the 
Trump administration’s VA resisted 
and refused to acknowledge the connec-
tion. 
I look forward to voting to add blad-
der 
cancer, 
hypothyroidism, 
and 
Parkinsonism to the list of Agent Or-
ange presumptives. One condition in 
our bill, hypertension, was not in-
cluded in this NDAA amendment, but I 
am committed to adding it during con-
ference. It is supported by the science 
as a condition linked to Agent Orange. 
The Trump administration says it 
doesn’t want to spend the money to 
cover the four conditions in this bill, 
but when we send people to war, we 
make a commitment. We make a com-
mitment, and we accept an obligation 
to treat them, no matter what the cost, 
no matter what the cause of their serv-
ice-related 
injuries 
are 
when 
the 
science and the facts support it. Facts 
are stubborn things, as many have 
said. To the veterans in Connecticut 
and nationwide, I will never stop fight-
ing to get good healthcare for our vet-
erans. I know this issue is bipartisan in 
its support. 
I look forward to voting in favor of 
the fiscal year 2021 NDAA, but I also 
think our colleagues must recognize 
that military spending alone does not 
guarantee our national security. These 
weapons platforms and the hardware 
that we produce does not constitute, 
alone, our national defense. It is the 
quality of our people, whether they are 
in the supply chain or the defense es-
tablishment or our troops on the 
ground or in the air or at sea. To re-
cruit and train the best possible mili-
tary, we need to have a strong non-
military 
infrastructure. 
Education, 
healthcare, housing—our national de-
fense includes those essential compo-
nents. 
So I believe that we must scrutinize 
this budget with a view to reducing 
any expenditures that are unnecessary. 
I will state as a matter of principle 
that when we vote on this NDAA, I will 
be supportive of amendments that 
might potentially achieve more equity 
and effectiveness in the way we make 
commitments in support of our na-
tional defense. We must interpret as 
broadly as is necessary how that de-
fense must be supported. 
It is not alone the money in this 
NDAA; it is also what we commit to ra-
cial justice in this country; the quality 
of our policing and our education, 
which should not depend on a young 
person’s ZIP Code; the quality of our 
healthcare, which right now has racial 
disparities that are inexcusable; hous-
ing that often results from redlining; 
and protections in the workplace, 
which could be achieved by a fairer, 
more effective use of OSHA. 
The quality of our society and our 
projection of power abroad depend on 
our quality of life and the quality of 
services that we provide on education, 
healthcare, housing, and all of the 
other infrastructure, including trans-
portation. We need to consider those 
factors and do what is necessary to as-
sure that our warfighters and our mili-
tary never have a fair fight, that they 
always predominate on the battlefield. 
We must protect our veterans to whom 
we make the commitment that we will 
always have their backs when they 
come home.

COMMANDER JOHN SCOTT HANNON VETERANS 
MENTAL HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am 
here this evening to discuss a tragic 
issue that is affecting way too many 
Americans across the country. This 
tragedy is mental health and suicide. A 
majority of Americans are encoun-
tering an unprecedented amount of 
stress due to COVID–19, and resources 
previously used to help individuals 
cope are even more limited. What is 
more concerning is that compounding 
stressors and depleted resources in-
crease the likelihood of public health 
disparities like the one I am discussing 
today. If there ever were a time to in-
vest in mental health, it is now. 
In a recent article from the Journal 
of the American Medical Association, 
researchers discussed several risk fac-
tors that put our Nation collectively at 
a higher risk for suicide. These risk 
factors include economic stress, de-
creased access to community and reli-
gious support systems, lack of access 
to adequate mental health and suicide 
prevention services, and social isola-
tion. This has unfortunately caused a 
severe lack of personal and social con-
nection, which we know to be a protec-
tive factor against suicide. 
This evening I want to specifically 
highlight veterans as they face unique 
risk factors for suicide, in addition to 
the increased stress around COVID–19. 
Research illustrates that veterans have 
a higher rate of suicide and certain 
mental health conditions than their ci-
vilian peers. We know there is not one 
single explanation or reason for sui-
cide, and there is no one single treat-
ment or prevention strategy. 
While post-traumatic stress disorder 
and traumatic brain injuries are promi-
nent among veterans and are known as 
an invisible wound of war, we now real-
ize other conditions, such as depres-
sion, anxiety, and substance use dis-
order, also contribute to suicide among 
veterans and all Americans. 
Our veterans are fighting new bat-
tles, and the stress caused by COVID–19 
has only exacerbated these issues. Just 
recently, two veterans from different 
generations, who lived on different 
coasts and fought in different wars dec-
ades apart, died by suicide. One was a 
74-year-old veteran who died on the 
campus of a VA facility in San Diego, 
and the other was a former Green Beret 
in Washington, DC. They are two of the 
20 veterans who are lost each day to 
suicide—a number we know as far too 
great. 
The Army recently lost a respected 
soldier known as ‘‘Captain America.’’ 
Master Sergeant Marckesano fought in 
Afghanistan, and according to news re-
ports, 30 soldiers from his former unit 
have died by suicide since their 2009 de-
ployment. Until the end, Master Ser-
geant Marckesano was encouraging 
members of his old unit to reach out 
and talk if they found themselves 
struggling, telling them ‘‘Don’t let the 
valley win.’’ Even soldiers who try to 
be strong for others find themselves in 
a circumstance where they don’t see 
another option, and they lose their bat-
tle. 
Another veteran I want to highlight 
today who fought a battle with his 
mental health was Commander John 
Scott Hannon. Commander Hannon’s 
DD–214 illustrates that he was a deco-
rated Navy SEAL, but he was much 
more than his service history and the 
wounds he bore as a result. His family 
and friends remember him as a pas-
sionate mental health advocate for vet-
erans with a gentle heart and a fierce

belief in taking tangible actions to 
tackle big challenges. 
Sadly, Commander Hannon lost his 
courageous fight with post-traumatic 
stress, bipolar disorder, and the effects 
of a traumatic brain injury in Feb-
ruary 2018. However, he lives on in the 
memories of his friends and family and 
as the namesake of pivotal legislation 
in the Senate that I am pleased to lead 
with the Senator from Montana, Mr. 
TESTER. 
For several months now, our com-
mittee has been working closely with 
the VA and the White House to im-
prove upon and advance the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act, 
S. 785, which will make necessary in-
vestments in suicide prevention serv-
ices, innovative research, and improve-
ments to mental healthcare. 
This bill will establish a grant pro-
gram that requires the VA and the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to better 
collaborate with community organiza-
tions across the country already serv-
ing veterans. This collaboration will 
result in earlier identification of vet-
erans who are at risk of suicide and 
will provide the ability to intervene 
with preventive services. This is a pro-
vision championed by my colleague 
from Arkansas, Senator BOOZMAN. Ad-
ditionally, this legislation requires the 
VA to bolster research efforts around 
brain and mental health conditions, ex-
pand upon telehealth partnerships to 
deliver better care to our veterans in 
rural areas, allow veterans to take ad-
vantage of emerging complimentary 
and integrative treatments, and so 
much more. 
This bipartisan legislation received a 
unanimous 17-to-0 vote in the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs earlier 
this year, and the time to act by the 
full Senate is now. We should not wait. 
The increased risk factors coupled 
with the negative effects of the pan-
demic could be a perfect storm for our 
veterans, 
as 
researchers 
from 
the 
American 
Psychological Association 
noted in a recent article. With this in 
mind, I am calling on my colleagues to 
do our part to make certain that every 
veteran has access to the lifesaving 
care and support they need. We need to 
ensure that every VA medical center is 
equipped with the proper personnel, 
evidence-based treatment options, and 
best research-informed care to fit the 
needs of each veteran who walks 
through that hospital door. 
For veterans and servicemembers 
like Commander John Scott Hannon 
and Master Sergeant Marckesano, we 
in Congress have the opportunity to 
take action to let them know they 
don’t have to struggle alone. This leg-
islation will help connect these vet-
erans and our servicemembers to more 
resources and provide them tools to ad-
dress challenges related to their serv-
ice. To my colleagues, we have a sig-
nificant role and responsibility to com-
bat this struggle, and here, today, we 
can do our part to make certain that in 
the end the valley does not win. 
In the spirit of this bill’s namesake, 
we must take real and urgent action to 
tackle this challenge together. As we 
seek swift action on S. 785 on the Sen-
ate floor, I ask my colleagues to join us 
in our fight against suicide. 
Lastly, to the veterans across the 
country who may hear this message 
today, who are experiencing thoughts 
of suicide, I ask you to reach out for 
help. Call a trusted friend, family 
member, or reach out to the Veterans 
Crisis Line. That number is 1–800–273– 
8255, and then press 1. Again, 1–800–273– 
8255, followed by pressing 1. 
I am pleased to know that in the fu-
ture, this crisis line will be updated to 
9–8-8. This is because the Senate acted 
on my legislation, along with Senator 
GARDNER, to designate 9–8-8 as the new 
national suicide and mental health cri-
sis hotline earlier this year. Last week, 
the FCC announced they will make this 
designation operational by July 16, 
2022. 
Suicide is preventable, and now is the 
time we take the stand necessary to 
protect the lives of people who have 
given so much for our Nation. They 
have protected us; we need to protect 
them. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
in downtown Atlanta at the corner of 
Auburn Avenue and Jesse Hill Jr Drive, 
there is a 65-foot mural of Congressman 
John Lewis with the lone caption: 
‘‘Hero.’’ 
I personally got to see it yesterday 
from the Downtown Connector, the 
major interstate that runs through the 
heart 
of 
Atlanta, 
as 
I 
drove 
to 
Hartsfield-Jackson 
airport. 
I 
was 
struck by the void left by his passing, 
not only in Georgia, but across our en-
tire country. 
When parents teach their children 
about courage and the fight for free-
dom and equality, the story of Con-
gressman John Lewis will be told. He 
dedicated his entire life to pushing 
America to live up to its promises. He 
championed nonviolent protests. He 
stood for community, justice, and love. 
Congressman Lewis’s story has in-
spired millions. At just 18, he wrote to 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he 
sought to attend the all-White Troy 
State University. He went on to be-
come a leader in the civil rights move-
ment. He organized sit-ins at seg-
regated lunch counters in Nashville. He 
was on the buses during the 1961 Free-
dom Rides. He was the youngest speak-
er at the 1963 March on Washington. He 
was brutally beaten while leading 
peaceful demonstrators across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. 
For the last 33 years, he served Geor-
gia in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, where he was known as ‘‘the con-
science of Congress.’’ He was also 
known for his many bipartisan friend-
ships. One of them was with my prede-
cessor, Senator Johnny Isakson, a true 
statesman. They shared a powerful mo-
ment last year on the House floor when 
Congressman Lewis embraced him dur-
ing farewell speeches to the Senator, 
one of the most touching moments in 
Congress’s recent history. 
Sadly, Congressman Lewis was not 
the only civil rights icon we lost last 
week. Georgia also lost Reverend C.T. 
Vivian. Both he and Congressman 
Lewis were champions of peaceful, non-
violent protest. I hope we can honor 
their legacy by using nonviolent means 
as we strive toward equality and a 
more perfect union. 
Georgians cannot think of our be-
loved State without thinking of these 
and so many other civil rights icons 
and leaders like Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Our Nation is better because 
of their leadership and their courage. 
Their legacy will never be forgotten. 
May God comfort the Lewis and Viv-
ian families during this incredibly dif-
ficult time.

REMEMBERING MARCOS GIL 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise 
in memory of Marcos Gil of Arimo, ID, 
who gave his life on April 28, 2018 res-
cuing a young woman from drowning. 
When 17-year-old Marcos Gil saw his 
girlfriend caught in a circular current 
downriver from a waterfall, he rushed 
to her aid. Despite being a poor swim-
mer, Marcos jumped into the Portneuf 
River to save the 14-year-old girl as she 
called for help, submerging himself in 
the powerful current and pushing her 
toward the bank of the river. With 
Marcos’ help, the young woman was 
able to grab hold of a branch at the 
edge of the riverbank and swim to safe-
ty. Tragically, Marcos was unable to 
extricate himself from that same cur-
rent, drowning in the process of saving 
the young woman’s life. 
Those who knew Marcos described 
him as friendly, deeply caring and 
eager to serve, and the story of his 
courage and sacrifice continues to reso-
nate throughout eastern Idaho and be-
yond. Members of the community have 
rallied around the Gil family, including 
the Bannock County Sheriff’s Office, 
which honored Marcos posthumously 
with the first ever lifesaving award 
presented to a civilian, and the Red 
Cross of Greater Idaho, which recog-
nized Marcos with its East Idaho Real 
Heroes award. This year, Marcos was 
posthumously awarded the Carnegie 
Medal by the Carnegie Hero Fund Com-
mission. The award, which is given to 
recognize those who have risked their 
lives to save others, will be presented 
to his parents, Margarito and Silvia 
Gil. 
At just 17 years old, Marcos Gil left 
the world far too soon. He is deeply 
missed by his family and all who were 
fortunate enough to know him, and his 
bravery and heroism will not be forgot-
ten.∑

REMEMBERING MARTHA FLORES 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I honor the life and legacy of Cuban- 
American radio legend and pioneer, 
Martha Flores from Miami, FL. 
As South Floridians grieve the loss of 
Martha Flores, an exemplary woman 
and radio trailblazer, let us honor her 
memory. For more than 60 years, Mar-
tha dedicated her life to her beloved 
audience and to her South Florida 
community. Martha, more commonly 
known as Miami radio’s own ‘‘Queen of 
the Night,’’ or la ‘‘Reina de la Noche’’ 
in Spanish, was the voice of Cuban ex-
iles and is remembered as the first 
Cuban female to conduct her own radio 
show in Florida. 
More than just a radio legend, com-
mentator, philanthropist, actress, and 
singer, Martha Flores was a Cuban- 
American patriot who tirelessly spoke 
out against the horrors of communism

TRIBUTE TO BRITTANY BROWN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I honor Brittany Brown, the Holmes 
County Teacher of the Year at Ponce 
de Leon High School in Ponce de Leon, 
FL. 
Brittany believes her work as an edu-
cator is to help her students grow and 
succeed not only in her classroom, but 
also in their lives. She finds the most 
rewarding part of her work hearing of 
her students’ newfound love of science. 
Brittany believes students lose ex-
citement and fascination for science by 
the time they reach high school, mak-
ing one of her primary goals to rekin-
dle the subject with them. She incor-
porates modern scientific equipment 
and technology in her curriculum to 
make science fun and interesting for 
her students. 
Brittany 
teaches 
biology, 
agri-
culture, and aerospace at Ponce de 
Leon High School and has been a 
science educator for 8 years. She enjoys 
teaching and hopes to pass on her pas-
sion for the subject to her students. 
I congratulate Brittany for receiving 
this important recognition. I look for-
ward to hearing of her continued suc-
cess in the coming years.∑

∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
it is my privilege to honor Belinda 
Fries, the Suwannee County Teacher of 
the Year from Suwannee High School

When named the district’s Teacher of 
the Year, Belinda noted she was hum-
bled and proud to be one of Suwannee 
County’s top educators. She is an expe-
rienced technology professional and 
has been teaching computer science 
and information technology to stu-
dents at Suwannee High School since

dents have the ability to fulfill their 
dreams, and she loves encouraging each 
of them to do and be their best. 
I extend my sincere thanks and best 
wishes to Belinda for her inspiring 
work to educate her students. I look 
forward to hearing of her continued 
good work in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO ALAN GATZKE 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I am pleased to recognize Alan Gatzke, 
the Columbia County Teacher of the 
Year from Fort White Elementary 
School in Fort White, FL. 
Alan cherishes the opportunities to 
connect with students and his fellow 
teachers. For four decades, he has con-
tinually brought his passion for teach-
ing and learning to schools and be-
lieves that it is the positive teaching 
relationships with his students and 
peers that has allowed him to succeed. 
Alan

science to students in fifth grade at 
Fort White Elementary School. During 
his more than 40-year teaching career, 
he has served as an elementary and

Daphne believes in her students and 
teaches them to believe in themselves. 
She encourages them to apply to mul-
tiple colleges and universities to broad-
en their options after they graduate 
from high school. She takes pride in

also her community. 
Brittinie’s love for her students is 
her reason to maintain high expecta-
tions for their excellence in school. 
Over the course of each year, her stu-

TRIBUTE TO ALLISON JONES 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today

Allison’s work towards improving her 
students’

TRIBUTE TO AMANDA JONES- 
CARLSON 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I recognize Amanda Jones-Carlson, the 
Gilchrist County Teacher of the Year 
at Trenton Elementary School in Tren-
ton, FL. 
Amanda considers it an absolute 
honor to be named Teacher of the Year 
for her school district. She views her 
students as her inspiration, believing 
that making a difference in just one of 
their lives motivates her to be the best 
teacher she can be. 
To her, seeing one of her students 
grasp a difficult or complex concept is 
what makes Amanda’s job worthwhile. 
She believes the best part about teach-
ing students is not just the chance to 
see them learn, but to watch their ex-
citement grow for the entire learning 
process. 
Amanda teaches first grade at Tren-
ton Elementary School and has taught 
in Gilchrist County for 8 years. 
I offer my sincere thanks and appre-
ciation to Amanda for her dedication

I am pleased to recognize David Mar-
tinez-Cooley, 
the 
Pinellas 
County 
Teacher of the Year from Leila G. 
Davis Elementary School in Clear-
water, FL. 
David is known for finding creative 
ways of engaging his students to pass 
on his passion and love for music. He 
considers himself to be just one of 
many teachers of the year across 
Pinellas County who dedicates their 
time to inspiring their students every 
day. 
David’s colleagues are enthralled by 
his enthusiasm and the drive he brings 
to his classroom each day. He is viewed 
as a role model among his peers, and 
many of his students throughout the 
years note the positive influence he has 
implanted in their lives. 
David is a music education teacher at 
Leila G. Davis Elementary School and 
has taught in Pinellas County for 13 
years. He received his master’s degrees 
in music education and mathematics 
education from the University of Flor-
ida. David also serves on the district’s 
textbook adoption committee, helping 
to select new digital resources for ele-
mentary music students. He has also 
helped in leading other music edu-
cators by presenting at district and 
State training events and assisted in 
the revision and refinement of the dis-
trict’s grade level key learnings. 
I would like to express my sincere 
thanks and appreciation to David and 
extend my best wishes on his continued 
success in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO CHEYENNA NOVOTNY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I 
am 
pleased 
to 
honor 
Cheyenna 
Novotny, the Escambia County Teach-
er of the Year at West Florida High 
School in Pensacola, FL. 
Cheyenna teaches chemistry and en-
vironmental science at West Florida 
High School and has been a teacher for 
16 years. Outside of the classroom, 
Cheyenna leads the student environ-
mental club and helped to launch a 
full-scale recycling program for the en-
tire school last year. 
For Cheyenna, it is important to 
know how her students are learning as 
they progress throughout the year. 
Each of her students receives an indi-
vidual whiteboard to use as they work 
to solve math or chemistry problems 
on their own. Having students show 
their work on the whiteboards helps 
them and Cheyenna to see firsthand 
how well they grasp a concept. 
Cheyenna 
believes 
in 
celebrating 
every learning victory for her students 
throughout the year, no matter how 
big or small. Her students view her not 
only as their teacher, but also as some-
one who is their friend who works to 
prepare them for their educational ca-
reers. She considers it a privilege to 
work with her students, to encourage 
their dreams, and to share their pas-
sions. 
I express my best wishes and grati-
tude to Cheyenna, and I look forward 
to hearing of her continued good work

TRIBUTE TO ANGELA ROBERTS 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I am pleased to recognize Angela Rob-
erts, the Martin County Teacher of the 
Year from Felix A. Williams Elemen-
tary School in Stuart, FL. 
Angela is a third grade English lan-
guage arts and social studies teacher at 
Felix A. Williams Elementary School. 
She has taught for 28 years, with 21 
years in the Martin County School Dis-
trict. She leads workshops during her 
school’s literacy nights, serves as a 
youth life coach and soloist at her 
church, moderates as a high school de-
bate team judge, volunteers as a mem-
ber of the Keep Martin Beautiful beach 
clean-up crew, and spends her time as 
an advanced choir parent volunteer for 
both Jensen Beach and Martin County 
high schools. 
Angela believes that children deserve 
a champion in their life, and she whole-
heartedly embraces this responsibility. 
Before she works to educate her stu-
dents’ minds, she connects with their 
hearts, learning who they are individ-
ually to design lessons that bring them 
to the core of her subject matter. She 
understands that what some students 
need most is not necessarily what is 
found in lesson plans, but what is found 
in a teacher’s heart. 
Angela knows that educators hold 
the high honor and responsibility of in-
fluencing 
future 
generations. 
Time 
spent in grade school encompasses a 
student’s most formative years, some-
times spent more with teachers than 
with parents. In consideration of this, 
at the beginning of each school year, 
Angela invites parents to download an 
app that provides them with access to 
communicate with the classroom, fol-
lowing the lesson plan alongside stu-
dents each day. 
I thank Angela for all the great work 
she has done for her students over the 
years. I extend my best wishes to her 
and look forward to hearing of her con-
tinued good work in the coming years.∑

Krista believes that all students can 
learn if they are given the opportunity 
to do so in the classroom. She is appre-
ciative of her students and cares for 
them, considering them to be the rea-
son for her success as a teacher. 
Throughout the school year, Krista 
provides her students with the tools 
they need to be successful and dedi-
cates each day to helping them in any 
way she can. Reflecting her commit-
ment, in 2019, 86 percent of Krista’s stu-
dents earned a proficient score on the 
Florida State Assessment.

RECOGNIZING SERGIO’S FAMILY 
RESTAURANT 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is my privilege to recognize 
a family-owned small business known 
for its community leadership and au-
thentic Cuban cuisine. This week, it is 
my pleasure to honor Sergio’s Family 
Restaurant of Miami, FL, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
In 1975, Blanca Cabrera opened what 
would become Sergio’s Family Res-
taurant as a small sandwich shop off of 
Bird Road in Miami. Equipped with 
generations of family recipes, Blanca 
sought to honor her Cuban heritage. 
Her shop provided employment for sev-
eral refugees, providing dignified work 
as they built new lives. She offered a 
fresh take on Cuban and American cui-
sine, and her sandwich shop became a 
local hit. 
Today, Sergio’s Family Restaurant 
has expanded to 13 locations in South 
Florida. Carlos Gazitua, the chief exec-
utive officer, is the third generation 
family member to lead Sergio’s. Under 
his leadership, the business has ex-
panded its community involvement and 
emphasized healthy living while re-
taining its signature flavor. Sergio’s 
has been recognized by the Florida De-
partment of Health as the first cer-
tified restaurant to take part in the 
Healthy Happens Here restaurant ini-
tiative, 
incorporating 
low-calorie 
versions of traditional Cuban eats on 
their menu. 
At the local and State level and 
among its industry peers, Sergio’s has 
been recognized for its outstanding cui-
sine. They were named Best Drive-Thru 
of 2015 by the Miami New Times, recog-
nized as the 2017 Restaurant of the 
Year by the South Florida Tourism 
Professional Awards, and their tradi-
tional empanadas were featured in 
‘‘Florida’s Best Cheap Eats’’ by Travel 
& Leisure Magazine. Additionally, the 
city of Miami and Miami-Dade County 
mayors honored Sergio’s with Croqueta 
Day on October 2, 2018. On this day, 
Sergio’s 
served 
its 
20 
millionth 
croqueta—croquette. 
As a community leader, Sergio’s has 
advocated for several nonprofit organi-
zations and local small businesses. In 
2015, Sergio’s donated food to a Live 
Like Bella Childhood Cancer Founda-
tion event. Then-Governor RICK SCOTT 
recognized Sergio’s service in 2017, 
when they collected and shipped food 
and supplies to Puerto Rico after Hur-
ricane Maria devastated the island. 
When Super Bowl LIV was held in 
Miami in 2020, Sergio’s partnered with 
The Women’s Fund of Miami-Dade to 
raise funds for its mission to create 
awareness and preventing sex traf-
ficking. Additionally, Carlos has advo-
cated for small business in local and in-
dustry events, including the ‘‘Bring 
Small Business Back’’ initiative. 
Like many Floridian small busi-
nesses, Sergio’s Family Restaurant 
stepped up to help its community dur-
ing the coronavirus pandemic. They 
participated in several social media, 
radio, and video initiatives encour-
aging support for local, family-owned 
small businesses. Partnering with the 
Miami Heat and the Miami Dade Coun-
ty Public School Superintendent, Ser-
gio’s Restaurant provided meals for 
more than 500 people in the Liberty 
City area. Sergio’s collaborated with 
Meals for Heroes Miami to feed local 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers, including donating approximately 
1,400 meals to the Miami-Dade Fire 
Rescue teams. Additionally, Carlos 
worked 
with 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services and the 
Florida Restaurant Lodging Associa-
tion to provide more than 350,000 reus-
able masks for hospitality workers in 
South Florida. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program, it provided a 
much needed lifeline to small busi-
nesses, including Sergio’s Restaurant. 
The PPP provides forgivable loans to 
impacted small businesses and non-
profits who maintain their payroll dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. Thanks to 
a PPP loan, Sergio’s was able to keep 
their employees paid until Miami re-
opened. Their community leadership 
and advocacy was recognized by Gov-
ernor Ron DeSantis who visited Ser-
gio’s in early June. 
Through their service and leadership, 
Sergio’s Family Restaurant is an out-
standing example of how small busi-
nesses uplift their communities. I com-
mend their support for local small 
businesses. Congratulations to Carlos 
and the entire team at Sergio’s res-
taurant. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success 
throughout South Florida.∑

VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION 
ESSAY CONTEST FINALISTS

Plastic is destroying the earth and a fed-
eral law to restrict single-use plastics must 
be developed. Plastic is a huge contributor to 
climate change and greenhouse gas emis-
sions that are warming the atmosphere. An 
article called ‘‘How Plastics Contribute to 
Climate Change’’ by Brooke Bauman from 
Yale Climate Connections states ‘‘plastic 
originates as fossil fuels and emits green-
house gasses from cradle to grave.’’ At the 
beginning of its life cycle, gas and oil are 
fracked from the ground, then made into 
plastic releasing harmful pollutants like CO2 
and nitrogen oxide that get stuck in the at-
mosphere and warm the earth. Along with 
greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollutes 
the ecosystems by simply entering and never 
leaving. In the same article by Yale, sci-
entists state ‘‘plastics can break down into 
smaller pieces called microplastics through 
biodegradation or exposure to the sun, heat 
or water. These microplastics scatter to all 
comers of the globe and even to the depths of 
the oceans. Toxic chemicals can bind micro-
plastics and create poison pills that marine 
animals eat’’ When a foreign substance en-
ters the ecosystem, it threatens all aspects 
of the life cycle; Including humans. 
Biodiversity is the root of life on earth and 
when exposed to something like plastic, ev-
erything feels an effect. For example, re-
search shows that plastic has entered into 
the human body most likely through food 
like fish and other meats. Animals eat the 
microplastics thinking they are nutrients; 
we eat the fish, therefore consuming the 
plastic in them. This can lead to many

health issues. Studies show that an average 
of 20 particles of microplastic has been found 
in 10 grams of human stool. ‘‘If our findings 
are remotely representative, annual micro-
plastic consumption could exceed several 
hundred thousand [particles],’’ authors of 
the Environmental Science and Technology 
concludes. Even in cases when physical plas-
tics pose little to no risk to human health, 
potentially harmful chemicals are added to 
plastics 
to 
modify 
appearance 
or 
functionality. Some of these chemicals in-
clude BPA and phthalates which have each 
been found to disrupt hormones in humans. 
BPA has been linked to increasing the risk 
of birth defects, metabolic diseases, and 
other health problems. Among other health 
risks, phthalate exposure has been found to 
reduce testosterone levels in male fetuses. 
Already, states including California, Con-
necticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New 
York, Oregon and Vermont—have success-
fully banned single-use plastic bags. In addi-
tion to banning plastic bags, Vermont’s SB 
113 will place restrictions on single-use 
straws and polystyrene containers. These 
few states are leading the initiative in a 
fight against an indestructible material. 
When it comes to plastic, there are plenty of 
realistic alternatives that we should be en-
forcing instead of fighting against it. Devel-
oping and making these alternative products 
affordable and more readily available is a 
necessary focus in working toward a more 
healthy environment. Plastic is a major con-
tributor to climate change. A national ban 
on single-use plastic is a simple start and 
necessary step toward saving the future of 
our planet. 
GRIFFIN WARYAS, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, SENIOR 
Ninety-Seven years ago, Frederick Banting 
discovered insulin. However, he decided not 
to put his name on the patent; he believed it 
was against the Hippocratic Oath to profit at 
the expense of patients. So, his team sold the 
patent to the University of Toronto for a 
dollar, in hopes that anyone who needed the 
medicine could afford it. Yet, today, ninety- 
seven years since the patent was sold for one 
dollar, people are dying because they cannot 
afford the insulin they need to survive. 
Nicole Smith-Holt’s son Alec died because 
of this. When his 26th birthday hit, he was no 
longer covered by his parent’s insurance, and 
his monthly insulin costs skyrocketed to a 
staggering $1,300 a month. Alec could no 
longer afford his medicine and passed away 
shortly after. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t an incredibly rare 
case. The costs of the most popular types of 
insulin have tripled over the past decade, the 
average cost per month has risen to $450 a 
month, and 1 in 4 diabetes patients now ei-
ther is forced to take partial doses or skip 
over their life-saving medicine. Unfortu-
nately, Insulin is not the only drug being 
used as a profit machine by corporate mon-
sters. 
In 2007, Mylan bought the rights to the 
EpiPen device. At that time, the cost of a set 
of two injectors was $94. A little over a dec-
ade later, the cost is over $700. And with 3.6 
million prescriptions being written last year, 
and the net price to make a set being $60, 
Mylan made about 2.3 BILLION dollars in 
profit. They know people will buy it regard-
less of price because they have to. This 
leaves the life of uninsured, poor individuals 
in the balance. 
To fix this, these large pharmaceutical 
companies need to be trust busted. They are 
buying off competition and abusing the bro-
ken American health care system to pad 
their pockets at the expense of the working 
class. Not to mention, they have teamed up 
with the insurance companies to ensure prof-
it at every comer. While these companies are 
businesses and should be allowed to operate 
as such, there comes a time when the gov-
ernment must protect us from them. As the 
great Teddy Roosevelt once said, ‘‘We draw 
the line against misconduct, not against 
wealth.’’ 
We need to employ the trust-busting laws 
set up in this nation to prevent these monop-
olies from preying on our citizens. To do 
this, we need to take the corruption out of 
Washington. In the time between January 
1st, 2017 and October 16th, 2018, 34 lawmakers 
received at least $100,000 including the House 
Republican majority leader. Drug companies 
should be banned from funding campaigns to 
prevent the purchasing of their economic 
safety. Another law that should be employed 
is a Sensible Drug Pricing Act. This would 
allow the companies to continue to make 
money but also allow poor Americans access 
to drugs that are relatively cheap to make, 
with a control on the pricing. 
KYLE WILKIN, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
Every day people experience struggle of 
some sort; they struggle in a class or have to 
work harder than anticipated to complete a 
goal, but some people struggle more than 
others. Working hard, people may find it im-
possible to improve; there may be something 
blocking their way or restricting their abil-
ity to complete a task. In situations like 
that people search for help; they turn to the 
people around them hoping to find support, 
so oftentimes people either find support, or 
they find indifference. When people’s basic 
needs aren’t met, they are left to fend for 
themselves. In the United States there are a 
total of 552,830 people were experiencing 
homelessness on a single night in 2018. Peo-
ple who are homeless are in need of people to 
support them. 
The first potential solution could be to al-
locate more money to fund social workers to 
help homeless people. Working with people 
who are homeless, social workers will be able 
to help them find housing. According to the 
Congressional Budget Office, in 2018 $623 bil-
lion were spent on defense; if some amount 
of that money was given to the compara-
tively low amount of $93 billion spent on 
education, training, employment, and social 
services combined, more people could work 
with those who are homeless to find housing. 
By making more social workers available, 
people who are homeless will be able to more 
easily access support. 
The second solution would be to support 
Housing First. Housing First is centered on 
the belief that everyone can achieve sta-
bility in permanent housing directly from 
homelessness and that stable housing is the 
foundation for pursuing other health and so-
cial services goals. Housing First is a way to 
find people, who are in need of it, permanent 
housing while giving them the support they 
need. By helping people find permanent 
housing, they are able to continue their lives 
and pursue goals that will not be available if 
they did not have housing. 
The third potential solution is making 
mental health facilities more available for 
homeless people. According to a survey done 
in 2015 by The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, 25 percent of the Amer-
ican homeless—140,000 individuals—were se-
riously mentally ill at any given point in 
time. Forty-five percent of the homeless— 
250,000 individuals—had any mental illness. 
A serious mental illness is defined as a dis-
ruption in normal thinking, feeling, mood, 
behavior, interpersonal interactions, or daily 
functioning by Merriam-Webster. By making 
mental health facilities more available and 
destigmatized for homeless people, they will 
be better equipped to live and be successful 
on their own. Homeless people need thy help 
and support of those around them; by giving 
people who are homeless options and the sup-
port they need they will be able to start to 
support themselves and find permanent.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SMITH): 
S. 4233. A bill to establish a payment 
program for unexpected loss of markets 
and revenues to timber harvesting and 
timber hauling businesses due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce a bill with my colleague, 
Senator SMITH that will help the hard-
working loggers across this Nation 
whose operations have suffered serious 
losses directly due to the pandemic. In 
Maine alone, logging has a roughly $650 
million annual economic impact, and is 
the backbone of the forest products 
economy. The industry is made up of 
countless 
multi-generational 
family 
businesses, whose survival is being se-
riously threatened. 
In Maine and in many places across 
the Country, the logging industry first 
felt the effects of COVID–19 in January 
as exports to foreign markets were sig-
nificantly limited if not eliminated en-
tirely. Declines in demand for paper 
products and other wood fiber based 
products caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic have prompted shutdowns, slow-
downs, and closures across the globe. 
As a result, Maine has seen declining 
demand for wood from mills across the 
board, and low prices and quotas driven 
by that lack of demand. And while tim-
ber prices have remained relatively 
stable, mills have drastically reduced 
their processing capacity—resulting in 
a ripple effect that has hit loggers and 
timber hauling companies hard. 
The Professional Logging Contrac-
tors of Maine projects at least a 20 per-
cent reduction in the annual harvest, 
which would threaten more than 600 
jobs and represent the potential loss of 
$86 million in economic activity in my 
State. The explosion of a pulp digester 
earlier this year at a mill in Jay, cou-
pled with the recent shutdown of a 
paper machine at another mill in 
Westbrook, have compounded the harm 
imposed by the pandemic. 
Although the industry is certainly 
not alone in its struggles during this 
time, it faces unique challenges, in-
cluding high capital costs relative to 
payroll and the fact that payroll costs 
do not reflect the amounts paid to 
independent contractors. And unlike 
some of our farmers who have been 
able to access direct payments from 
USDA and our fishermen who were al-
located relief funding in the CARES 
Act, our forestry professionals have 
not been provided targeted assistance. 
The legislation we are introducing 
today would direct the Secretary of 
Agriculture to provide financial assist-
ance to loggers and timber hauling 
businesses that have experienced at 
least a 10 percent loss in revenues from 
January 2020 through July 2020 as com-
pared to the same timeframe last year. 
The amount would be equal to 10 per-
cent of 2019 gross revenues and could 
only be used for operating expenses, in-
cluding payroll. I am grateful for the 
American Logging Council’s support of 
our legislation, and urge my colleagues

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4351 
July 21, 2020 
to join in this effort to support one of 
our country’s core economic drivers. 
Loggers and forestry industry profes-
sionals were rightfully deemed essen-
tial workers during this public health 
crisis, and we must ensure that they 
receive 
the 
support 
necessary 
to 
emerge from this downturn. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, Mr. JONES, and Mr. 
TILLIS): 
S. 4237. A bill to extend zero interest 
rate benefits and payment suspension 
to all Federal student loan borrowers, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, 
along with Senator MURKOWSKI, we are 
introducing legislation to provide re-
lief to all Federal student loan bor-
rowers during this public health and 
economic crisis. The bipartisan Stu-
dent Loan Fairness Act, which is also 
cosponsored by Senators MURKOWSKI, 
JONES, and TILLIS, will correct an in-
equity in the CARES Act that left out 
millions of Federal student loan bor-
rowers from benefits to ease the burden 
of repayment as we continue to fight 
COVID–19. 
The CARES Act benefits are re-
stricted to borrowers of student loans 
that are held by the Federal govern-
ment. This leaves out the borrowers 
whose Federal Family Education Loans 
(FFEL) are still held by commercial 
and State agency lenders, and those 
with Perkins Loans that are adminis-
tered by institutions of higher edu-
cation. In fact, nearly 6 million bor-
rowers were left out under the FFEL 
Program and another 1.9 million under 
the Perkins Loan Program. This dis-
parate treatment by loan type is as 
confusing as it is unfair. 
In April, a broad group of more than 
two dozen organizations representing 
educators, borrower advocates, vet-
erans, lenders, guaranty agencies, and 
student loan servicers implored Con-
gress to remedy this inequity. They 
wrote, ‘‘A Federal loan borrower—re-
gardless of the origination of that loan, 
be it Part B, D, E, commercial, or gov-
ernment-held—should 
receive 
equal, 
immediate, and critical support in this 
unprecedented time . . . Already, bor-
rowers are confused as to why their 
Federal loans are treated differently 
than others.’’ 
The Student Loan Fairness Act will 
extend the CARES Act relief to these 
borrowers by covering the cost of inter-
est and suspending monthly payments 
for the period of March 13 through Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and suspending all in-
voluntary collection, such as adminis-
trative wage garnishment or offsets 
from tax refunds, for this period. 
This legislation is one component of 
what should be a comprehensive pack-
age of student loan debt relief. As the 
crisis continues, we should extend the 
repayment relief until health and eco-
nomic conditions improve sufficiently 
for borrowers to be able to begin repay-
ment. Additionally, we should forgive 
at least $10,000 of debt for each student 
loan borrower to help speed the recov-
ery and reduce the drag of the roughly 
$1.6 trillion in outstanding student 
loan debt on economic prospects for 
over 40 million Americans. Going for-
ward, we must reduce the need for stu-
dent loan borrowing by expanding 
need-based grants, such as the Pell 
Grant, and ensuring that states and in-
stitutions do their part to lower the 
cost to students and families. 
We should work together to build on 
the important steps Congress took to 
provide relief to student loan bor-
rowers in the CARES Act. However, we 
need to ensure that all Federal student 
loan borrowers have access to this re-
lief. I hope that my colleagues will join 
us in cosponsoring the Student Loan 
Fairness Act and pushing for its inclu-
sion in the next COVID–19 relief pack-
age. 
By Mrs. LOEFFLER (for herself, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, and Mr. COT-
TON): 
S. 4238. A bill to amend title 18, 
United States Code, relating to crimi-
nal street gangs, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, this 
spring, 14-year-old Janina Valenzuela 
was riding a bike with a friend in Mari-
etta, GA, when she was killed as part 
of an initiation into an MS–13 gang. In 
2016, Christopher Dean was brutally 
murdered by gang members in Atlanta. 
The D.A. called it ‘‘the most horrific 
death’’ in recent history. His murder 
left two children without a father. In 
2010, 11-year-old Nicholas Sheffey was 
shot and killed sleeping in his bed dur-
ing a drive-by shooting in Chamblee, 
GA. These are just three of the too 
many lives that have been lost, trag-
ically cut short due to senseless gang 
violence. 
In Georgia, there are over 71,000 
known gang members representing a 
variety 
of 
gangs, 
including 
the 
Ghostface Gangsters, an all-White gang 
in Georgia; the Gangster Disciples, 
which formed in Chicago and quickly 
spread to Georgia; and the Aryan 
Brotherhood, a White supremacy gang. 
Nationwide, there are more than 1.4 
million 
members 
and 
33,000 
gangs 
across the U.S. According to the most 
recent National Gang Report, half of 
law enforcement officials reported that 
gang-related violence has increased in 
each of their jurisdictions. Thankfully, 
President Trump and Georgia leaders 
have taken strong action to address 
the rising tide of gang violence and to 
end the cycles of violence that they 
cause. 
For the first time ever, the Depart-
ment of Justice has brought terrorism 
charges against a member of the MS–13 
gang, taking action against their lead-
er and 21 other gang members. 
Under the leadership of Georgia Gov-
ernor Brian Kemp and Attorney Gen-
eral Chris Carr, my home State of 
Georgia has led the way on confronting 
gang violence, passing legislation that 
gives prosecutors the tools they need 
to disrupt and dismantle these terrible 
gang networks. 
Today, I am introducing the Crack-
ing Down on Gangs and Deporting 
Criminals Act to apply Georgia’s anti- 
gang, pro-community measures across 
our country. This legislation, based on 
the Georgia law that Attorney General 
Carr has called ‘‘one of the strongest 
statutes in the Nation,’’ aims to deter 
and punish criminals who set out to de-
stroy lives and communities. This in-
cludes violent crimes like the murders 
of Janina, Christopher, and Nicholas. 
In addition to violence, gangs run 
elaborate drug operations. One recent 
bust in Pickens County last month re-
sulted in the arrest of nearly 50 indi-
viduals. Law enforcement confiscated 
nearly $2 million worth of meth-
amphetamine from a drug ring run by 
three gangs. 
They deal in the abhorrent world of 
human trafficking. A study in San 
Diego County found that an astounding 
85 percent of those involved in human 
trafficking were actively involved in 
gangs. 
Current Federal gang statute has 
three strict criteria that are difficult 
for prosecutors to meet in order to hold 
someone accountable for their partici-
pation in a street gang. The legislation 
I am introducing today will make it 
easier for Federal prosecutors to seek 
harsh sentences for gang activity. It 
will facilitate the removal of criminal 
gang members who are in our country 
illegally, and it would create a na-
tional gang database, making it easier 
to eradicate these gang networks. 
We need to take action now to take 
violent 
gang 
members 
off 
of 
our 
streets. Across the country, violence is 
skyrocketing in our cities, while radi-
cals call to defund and abolish the po-
lice. The troubling decline in support 
for law enforcement, coupled with the 
effects of the pandemic and recent un-
rest, threatens the further spread of 
gang violence across communities in 
America. 
The Cracking Down on Gangs and De-
porting Criminals Act will help keep 
our communities safe and support law 
enforcement in their work to root out 
gang activity. No family should have 
to go through what Janina, Chris-
topher, 
and 
Nicholas 
did. 
Parents 
should be able to send their children 
outdoors and off to school without wor-
rying that they won’t make it home, 
and children shouldn’t fear that their 
parents won’t return home. It is time 
that we hold gang members account-
able for their vile and evil actions and 
keep the American public safe. 
By Mr. DURBIN: 
S. 4242. A bill to establish programs 
related to prevention of prescription 
opioid misuse, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD.

gineering, and Medicine (referred to in this 
section as the ‘‘National Academies’’) to 
carry out a study on the addition of coverage 
under the Medicare program under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act of alter-
native treatment modalities (such as inte-
grative medicine, including acupuncture and 
exercise therapy, neural stimulation, bio-
feedback, radiofrequency ablation, and trig-
ger point injections) furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries who suffer from acute or chron-
ic lower back pain. Such study shall, pursu-
ant to the contract under this paragraph, in-
clude an analysis of— 
(1) scientific research on the short-term 
and long-term impact of the addition of such 
coverage on clinical efficacy for pain man-
agement of such beneficiaries; 
(2) whether the lack of Medicare coverage 
for alternative treatment modalities impacts 
the volume of opioids prescribed for bene-
ficiaries; and 
(3) the cost to the Medicare program of the 
addition of such coverage to treat pain and 
mitigate the progression of chronic pain, as 
weighed against the cost of opioid use dis-
order, overdose, readmission, subsequent sur-
geries, and utilization and expenditures 
under parts B and D of such title. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, pursuant 
to the contract under subsection (a), the Na-
tional Academies shall submit to Congress a 
report on the study under subsection (a).

SPONSE 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. LEAHY,

ROSEN, and Mr. MERKLEY) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 653 
Whereas United States contributions to 
the World Health Organization (WHO) are le-
veraged with contributions from other coun-
tries, the private sector, and foundations to 
advance longstanding United States global 
health priorities; 
Whereas the WHO was founded in 1948 with 
United States help and has been at the fore-
front of major global health achievements in 
the last 72 years, including the eradication of 
polio, because of United States financial and 
diplomatic support; 
Whereas the United States has consist-
ently been the largest donor to the WHO in 
recognition of its vital role in saving lives, 
improving global disease detection, and co-
ordinating a global public health response; 
Whereas the WHO is able to implement 
health programs in places the United States 
Government cannot as effectively operate in, 
including Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo; 
Whereas the WHO leads polio surveillance, 
immunization, and technical support, and is 
able to reach remote areas in countries 
where polio still exists; 
Whereas the President’s Emergency Plan 
for AIDS Relief works with the WHO to en-
hance programs and policies in areas, includ-
ing laboratory capacity, prevention of moth-
er to child transmission of HIV, health sys-
tem strengthening, prevention of tuber-
culosis infections, and counseling and test-
ing; 
Whereas the United States is home to 83 
different WHO collaborating centers, more 
than 20 of which are at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and the National Institutes of 
Health; 
Whereas the WHO, following the 2014 West 
African Ebola outbreak, undertook a series 
of reforms to strengthen its health emer-
gencies program and response in large part 
due to United States involvement; 
Whereas the WHO is leading the global re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic with its 
technical, communications, and organiza-
tional capacities in 150 countries; 
Whereas the WHO is coordinating an un-
precedented global clinical trial, known as 
the ‘‘Solidarity Trial’’, to evaluate the safe-
ty and effectiveness of 4 drug treatment 
combinations against COVID–19, involving 
more than 100 countries, 400 hospitals, and 
more than 3,500 patients; 
Whereas the WHO is leading the global ef-
fort to supply health commodities and is co-
ordinating the United Nations Global Supply 
Chain Task Force, which is working with the 
private sector, the World Food Programme, 
and the European Central Bank to establish 
an emergency supply chain for low-resource 
countries; 
Whereas at least 135 countries rely on the 
WHO to procure millions of pieces of per-
sonal protective equipment and other vital 
health commodities like tests and testing 
supplies; 
Whereas the WHO is the only organization 
with the legal mandate and capacity to gath-
er public health data from any country in 
the world and use it to quickly develop and 
disseminate technical guidance to help coun-
tries prepare public health responses; 
Whereas the WHO, through a partnership 
with member states, major donors, and pri-
vate sector partners called the ACT Accel-
erator, is already working to pre-position 
manufacturing capacity and distribution 
channels to ensure that all countries have 
access to future therapies and vaccines fast-
er and at a fair price; 
Whereas the Trump Administration froze 
funding to the WHO pending a ‘‘60 to 90 day 
review’’ on April 14, 2020, but without any 
disclosure of the review’s findings, gave the 
WHO 30 days to make unspecified reforms on 
May 19, 2020, and then, 11 days later, an-
nounced the United States would withdraw 
from the WHO; 
Whereas, on June 25, 2020, the Senate 
passed by unanimous consent S. Res. 579, 
urging United States leadership and partici-
pation in global efforts on therapeutics and 
vaccine development and delivery to address 
COVID–19; and 
Whereas, on July 6, 2020, the Trump Ad-
ministration officially submitted a formal 
letter to the United Nations Secretary Gen-
eral to withdraw the United States from the 
WHO: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) withdrawing the United States from the 
World Health Organization— 
(A) 
undermines 
United 
States 
global 
health priorities and threatens lives around 
the world and in the United States; 
(B) risks weakening the global response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(C) threatens United States humanitarian 
responses; and 
(D) creates a vacuum of leadership at the 
WHO at a time when it has been our ex-
pressed interest to counter China’s growing 
influence within the organization; and 
(2) the World Health Assembly agreed by 
consensus to appoint an interim assessment 
of the response to COVID–19, and by remain-
ing a member in good standing, the United 
States will have the most leverage to advo-
cate and put in place the reforms necessary 
for the World Health Organization to respond 
to this and future crises. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are 
in unprecedented times. Modem trans-
portation and communication tech-
nology make our world more inter-
connected than it has ever been. These 
advancements, especially international 
travel, create risks, as we have seen 
through the devastating spread of the 
novel coronavirus all over the globe. 
But 
close 
global 
connections 
also 
strengthen our capacity to work col-
laboratively to tackle threats facing 
our communities. The COVID–19 pan-
demic is one such threat—it is a chal-
lenge that we will only be able to over-
come together. United Nations Sec-
retary General Antonio Guterres put it 
best when he said, ‘‘We are only as 
strong as the weakest health systems.’’ 
President Trump’s decision on July 
6th to begin formally withdrawing the 
United States from the World Health 
Organization, or the WHO, is irra-
tional, reckless, and simply the wrong 
thing to do. While the WHO is not per-
fect, its technical capacities and rela-
tionship with nearly every country in 
the world make it the best organiza-
tion to manage the response to a global 
pandemic like COVID–19. A few weeks 
ago, the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee heard from a panel of pub-
lic health experts who all spoke with 
one voice—leaving the WHO in the 
middle of a global pandemic will not 
only compromise the international re-
sponse to COVID–19, it will put Ameri-
cans’ lives at risk. 
Today, I am introducing a resolution 
with 28 co-sponsors that expresses the 
sense of the Senate that withdrawing 
from the WHO undermines U.S. global 
health leadership and the international 
COVID–19 response. This resolution 
recognizes that since the WHO was 
founded in 1948—with help from the 
United States—it has relied on U.S. 
support to lead the world in disease de-
tection and eradication and strength-
ening health systems. The resolution 
also highlights the significant benefit 
the U.S. gains by participating in the 
WHO, including the ability to improve 
public health in regions of the world 
that would be impossible to reach on 
our own. 
Finally, the resolution highlights the 
lifesaving work of the WHO in respond-
ing to the COVID–19 pandemic. This 
work includes convening an unprece-
dented global clinical trial—the Soli-
darity Trial—to help find an effective 
treatment for COVID–19; coordinating 
global supply chains of personal protec-
tive equipment and other health com-
modities for more than 135 countries; 
and pre-positioning manufacturing ca-
pacity and distribution channels to en-
sure that all countries have access to 
future therapies and vaccines faster 
and at a fair price. Last month, the 
Senate unanimously passed a resolu-
tion urging U.S. participation in global 
efforts on therapeutics and vaccine de-
velopment and delivery to address 
COVID–19. Leaving the WHO will make 
it drastically more difficult to accom-
plish those goals. 
The WHO has its flaws, but the 
United States is best positioned to ef-
fect positive changes by maintaining 
our seat at the table. Historically, we

have been able to encourage the WHO 
to make important reforms, like im-
provements 
to 
the 
organization’s 
health emergencies program that were 
undertaken following the 2014 West Af-
rican Ebola outbreak. By withdrawing 
from the WHO, we are forfeiting our 
voice in these conversations and em-
powering countries that do not have 
our best interests in mind. The inter-
national community, and especially 
the American people, will suffer as a 
result. 
For these reasons, I hope that I can 
count on the Senate’s support for this 
important resolution. If we are to be 
successful in the fight against COVID– 
19 and any other pandemic health chal-
lenges we may encounter, the U.S. can-
not isolate itself from the rest of the 
world. An isolationist stance will only 
lead to domestic and global failure. 
With the pandemic raging in our own 
backyard, it is more important than 
ever before for the United States to 
continue to collaborate with countries 
around the world to end this global 
health emergency and prevent future 
ones from starting. If I may paraphrase 
John Donne, no nation—not even the 
United States—‘‘is an island entire of 
itself.’’ We are all ‘‘part of the main’’ 
and the bell tolls for all of us.

SENATE RESOLUTION 654—DESIG-
NATING JULY 25, 2020, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL DAY OF THE AMERICAN 
COWBOY’’ 
Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. BARRASSO, 
Mr. TESTER, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. ROUNDS, Mr. 
HOEVEN, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. BENNET, and 
Mr. UDALL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 654 
Whereas pioneering men and women, rec-
ognized as ‘‘cowboys’’, helped to establish 
the American West; 
Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, in-
tegrity, courage, compassion, respect, a 
strong work ethic, and patriotism; 
Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies 
strength of character, sound family values, 
and good common sense; 
Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends 
ethnicity, gender, geographic boundaries, 
and political affiliations; 
Whereas the cowboy, who lives off the land 
and works to protect and enhance the envi-
ronment, is an excellent steward of the land 
and its creatures; 
Whereas cowboy traditions have been a 
part of American culture for generations; 
Whereas the cowboy continues to be an im-
portant part of the economy through the 
work of many thousands of ranchers across 
the United States who contribute to the eco-
nomic well-being of every State; 
Whereas millions of fans watch profes-
sional and working ranch rodeo events annu-
ally, making rodeo one of the most-watched 
sports in the United States; 
Whereas membership and participation in 
rodeo and other organizations that promote 
and encompass the livelihood of cowboys 
span every generation and transcend race 
and gender; 
Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in 
literature, film, and music and occupies a 
central place in the public imagination; 
Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; 
and 
Whereas the ongoing contributions made 
by cowboys and cowgirls to their commu-
nities should be recognized and encouraged: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 25, 2020, as ‘‘National 
Day of the American Cowboy’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe the day with appropriate

SEC. 752. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE ARMED 
FORCES INSTITUTE FOR REGENERA-
TIVE MEDICINE. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the Armed Forces Institute for Regen-
erative Medicine (in this section referred to 
as ‘‘AFIRM’’) delivers critical regenerative- 
based technologies lead to functional and 
aesthetic recovery from injuries incurred 
during service in the Armed Forces; 
(2) AFIRM is a highly rated, nationally re-
spected public-private consortium leading 
the development of restorative therapies for 
battlefield trauma as part of several re-
search and development programs directed 
to meet defined medical technology gaps for 
warfighter groups; 
(3) the efforts by AFIRM span from re-
search and development to clinical trans-
lation, implementation, and commercializa-
tion, with therapies developed for extremity 
and craniofacial trauma, skin and genito-
urinary injuries, and transplantation; 
(4) each AFIRM project specifically ad-
dresses 
a 
key 
need 
of 
the 
wounded 
warfighter, which has helped guide research 
projects toward partnerships with industry 
that can be reviewed for approval and en-
tered into clinical trials for eventual place-
ment in the marketplace; 
(5) technologies developed by AFIRM in-
clude, in part, those that will result in the 
ability to generate and integrate functional 
composite 
tissue, 
neural 
pathways, 
vascularization, aesthetic skin, bone, and 
muscle; 
(6) despite the technology challenges, the 
public-private teaming approach to medical 
research and development used by AFIRM 
has resulted in more than 24 products reach-
ing clinical trials; 
(7) it is essential that Congress continue to 
support the technology exploration, matura-
tion, and transition in regenerative medicine 
set forth by AFIRM; and 
(8) the Senate encourages allocation of 
funds to AFIRM from the undistributed med-
ical research funds provided in this Act to fa-
cilitate the continued implementation of the 
innovative 
consortium 
model 
used 
by 
AFIRM that has a proven track record of 
success.

IN RECOGNITION OF STEVE MAD-
DOX 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
2019 
WORLD 
DAIRY 
EXPO’S 
DAIRY-
MAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mr. Steve Maddox, Sr. 
of RuAnn and Maddox Dairies on being 
named the 2019 World Dairy Expo’s Dairyman 
of the Year. 
Steve Maddox, a third-generation dairyman 
from Riverdale in Fresno County, knows that 
dairy farming is not just a career it’s a way of 
life. A life that proudly unites generations of 
his family. In 1957 Steve’s father, Doug Mad-
dox started RuAnn Dairy. There Steve’s love 
for dairy farming was kindled and when the 
family purchased a farm in 1980 just 10 miles 
off RuAnn Dairy he took on new responsibil-
ities managing the new farm, Maddox Dairy. 
Maddox Dairy has grown tremendously 
since then and now Steve manages the 3,200 
milking cows there and his brother, Patrick 
Maddox, the 1,100 at RuAnn Dairy. Steve’s 
commitment to the industry goes beyond his 
own dairy operation. He was one of the initial 
board of directors for California Dairies, Inc., 
and has served as board secretary for over 10 
years. He was also involved with the creation 
of the producer owned dairy cooperative Dairy 
America Inc. and has sat on the board of the 
National Milk Producers Federation. 
Additionally, through his commitment to the 
Dairy Industry, Steve has served as a model 
for genetic innovation for dairymen throughout 
the United States. The Maddox Dairy began 
as a grade commercial herd, however, through 
Steve’s dedication to genetic advancement 
and through embryo transfer the herd was 
transitioned to 100 percent registered Hol-
steins. Both RuAnn and Maddox Dairies are 
committed to advancing genetics in the indus-
try striving to improve not just the breed ge-
netics of their operation but now export their 
dairy cattle genetics to 35 countries. 
Due to the hard work and commitment of 
local family farmers like Steve Maddox, the 
21st Congressional District is the largest dairy 
producing district in the country, and Fresno 
County is amongst the top ag producing coun-
ties in the nation. I offer my sincerest con-
gratulations to Mr. Maddox for being named 
the 2019 World Dairy Expo’s Dairyman of the 
Year and wish him continued success as he 
continues to lead the front of the Dairy Indus-
try. 
TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JOSEPH 
STORTI, UNITED STATES ARMY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Major Joseph Storti for his exem-
plary dedication to duty and service as an 
Army Congressional Fellow and Congressional 
Budget Liaison for the Assistant Secretary of 
the Army for Financial Management and 
Comptroller. Major Storti is transitioning from 
his present assignment to serve as the Direc-
tor of the Army Budget’s Executive Officer. 
A native of Pensacola, Florida, Major Storti 
was commissioned as an infantry officer after 
completion from the Officer Candidate School 
at Fort Benning. He also earned a Master’s 
degree in Legislative Affairs from the George 
Washington University, a Master of Business 
Administration from American Public Univer-
sity, as well as a Master of Public Administra-
tion from the University of South Florida. 
Major Storti has served in a broad range of 
assignments during his Army career. His most 
recent assignment was as the Chief for Spe-
cial Authorities at the Joint Special Operations 
Command. In this position he provided guid-
ance and support, with a full range of special 
authority funding. He also served as the com-
mander of the Financial Management Support 
Unit while with the command. Prior to his duty 
with Joint Special Operations Command, 
Major Storti simultaneously served as the Ex-
ecutive Officer for the 82nd Financial Manage-
ment Support Unit and as the Commander of 
Alpha Detachment, 82nd Financial Manage-
ment Support Unit. As an Infantry Officer, 
Major Storti held myriad positions, which in-
cluded: mechanized infantry platoon leader, 
company executive officer, brigade planner, 
and battalion assistant operations officer. 
In his capacity as an Army Congressional 
Fellow, I had the privilege to host Joe in my 
office and, subsequently, enjoyed his ongoing 
and diligent support during his assignment as 
a Congressional Budget Liaison for the U.S. 
Army. Major Storti worked tirelessly with Mem-
bers of Congress and their staff to accurately 
articulate the Army’s budget positions to the 
Appropriations Committees and track down in-
formation to assist offices pursue Army related 
priorities. His professionalism, energy, dili-
gence, and commitment to the mission are re-
freshing and unmatched. As both a fellow and 
as a liaison, he effectively represented the 
U.S. Army and the Department of Defense to 
the United States Congress. 
The foundation of Joe’s military success is 
his family. He is a devoted husband to his 
wife, Brittany, and committed father to their 
children, Noah and Logan. Brittany, Noah, and 
Logan provide the foundation for Joe’s serv-
ice. The Storti’s attitude of service, sacrifice, 
and care for others permeates every organiza-
tion and activity in which they participate. They 
are true examples of servant leaders in the 
Army and the communities they engage. 
Throughout his career, Major Storti has 
positively impacted soldiers, peers, and supe-
riors. Our country has benefited tremendously 
from his extraordinary leadership, judgment, 
and passion. I join my colleagues today in 
honoring his dedication to our Nation and in-
valuable service to the United States Con-
gress as an Army Congressional Liaison. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine 
pleasure to have worked with Major Joseph 
Storti over the last three years. On behalf of 
a grateful nation, this body recognizes and 
commends Joe for his service to our country. 
We wish him all the best as he continues his 
service in the United States Army.

GORDON CHARLES LAMPITT 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Browns 
Mills, New Jersey resident Gordon Charles 
Lampitt. 
Gordon Charles Lampitt was a Bronx, New 
York native, but has called Browns Mills home 
since 1958. Gordon dedicated his life to his 
family and his country. 
Command Sergeant Major Gordon Lampitt 
retired with 28 years in the United States 
Army. He was a decorated Army Veteran and 
served in the Second World War, the Korean 
War, and the Vietnam War. He served three 
tours in the Second World War, three tours in 
the Korean War, and two tours in the Vietnam 
War. There were only 171,000 total service 
men and women who served in all three of 
those wars, out of the millions of American 
service members who served in each of them. 
After Gordon retired from the United States 
Army his commitment to serving his country 
did not stop there. Gordon worked for 15 
years in property management at Fort Dix. He 
was a member of St. Ann’s Church, Browns 
Mills, and the Browns Mills Memorial VFW 
Post 6805. He was also a life member of the 
Bass Masters and an avid fisherman. 
Gordon was a loving husband to his late 
wife Rose Lampitt for 71 years. Gordon was a 
beloved father of Margaret R. Long and hus-
band William, Charles Lampitt and his wife 
Assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt, Susan L. 
Veres and husband Michael, Elizabeth Stelljes 
and husband Scott, and Phillip Lampitt and 
wife Christa. He was also a loving grandfather 
of ten and a loving great grandfather of six. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Command Sergeant Major Gordon 
Charles Lampitt, of Browns Mills, New Jersey, 
for his unwavering commitment to serving our 
country over the course of his lifetime. His re-
markable dedication to this country, exempli-
fied by his service in three wars is the ultimate 
testament of his patriotism and courage.

RECOGNIZING 
CLINTON 
HIGH 
SCHOOL’S AIR FORCE ROTC FOR 
RECEIVING UNIT OF THE YEAR 
RECOGNITION FOR THE STATE 
OF TENNESSEE 
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
FLEISCHMANN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, the 
mission of the Air Force Junior Reserve Offi-
cer Training Corps is to develop citizens of 
character who are dedicated to serving their 
nation and community. Clinton High School 
AFJROTC did it in spades, and superbly. 
Clinton High TN 2011–1 is in its 9th year of 
existence; the program consists of 107 cadets; 
58 percent of the school students are on free/ 
reduced cost lunch, and 2019 through 2020 
has been a year of accolades, achievements, 
and superlatives. As of the coronavirus pan-
demic shutdown in mid-March, Clinton High 
TN 2011–1 had accumulated 565 Community 
Service Hours and 608 Leadership Develop-
ment Hours. In addition, Cadets Dylan Mont-
gomery and Dylan Butler both earned the Boy 
Scout Eagle award which also included exten-
sive community service projects. 
Clinton High TN 2011–1 has also displayed 
excellence in scholarship. Their academic 
team made the semi-finals for the Joint Lead-
ership Academic Bowl for the third year in a 
row. Five of the top eight graduating seniors 
were AFJROTC cadets. Cadet Dylan Butler 
graduated third out of 300 and received a 4- 
year AFROTC scholarship to the University of 
Tennessee at Knoxville, the state university 
system’s flagship school. Cadet Kaylee Puleo 
graduated fourth out of 300 and received an 
appointment to the US Military Academy at 
West Point. Cadet Dylan Montgomery grad-
uated fifth out of 300 and received a 4-year 
scholarship to The Citadel, The Military Col-
lege of South Carolina. Cadet Travis Vaugh 
graduated seventh out of 300 and was se-
lected for the Nuclear Navy’s submarine ca-
reer track based on his GPA and ASVAP 
scores. Cadet Summer Sieber graduated 
eighth out of 300 and received a 4-year schol-
arship to The University of Tennessee at 
Knoxville’s Tickle College of Engineering. 
Clinton High TN 2011–1 has also shown ex-
cellence in leadership, with two cadets sitting 
on the Principal’s Student Action Leadership 
Team and two cadets representing Clinton 
High School on the Anderson County School 
Board. 
Clinton High TN 2011–1 also showed excel-
lence in drill and ceremonies at the Daniel 
Boone Drill Meet. They received the out-
standing unit, Esprit de Corps, award, the 
color guard received third place, received third 
place in the All-Freshman Team unit inspec-
tion, and Cadet Dylan Butler came in second 
place for the individual knockout. 
Finally, Clinton High TN 2011–1 has shown 
excellence in orienteering by coming in third 
place during the Anderson County High 
Orienteering Competition. 
Clinton High School AFJROTC 2011–1 
makes a difference. In spite of growing up in 
challenging economic, family, and educational 
backgrounds, they exemplify the Air Force 
Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps’ mission 
to develop citizens of character who are dedi-
cated to serving their nation and community; 
personify the Air Force Core Values of Integ-
rity First, Service before Self, and Excellence 
in All We Do, and merit selection as the Air 
Force Association AFJROTC Unit of the Year 
for 2020.

NIVERSARY OF HOLIDAY GRILL 
CONEY ISLAND 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Holiday Grill Coney Island on its twenty-fifth 
anniversary. This wonderful milestone is wor-
thy of commendation and celebration. 
Holiday Grill was founded in 1995 by John 
Mourselas. Twenty-five years later, Holiday 
Grill continues to be a cherished Dearborn in-
stitution that is beloved by many. Throughout 
the community, Holiday Grill is recognized for 
its delectable food, attentive and friendly staff, 
and welcoming ambiance that draws cus-
tomers in and brings people together. Located 
in the heart of Dearborn, Holiday Grill has 
undoubtably become a pillar of the community. 
Many patrons are regulars who have fre-
quented the restaurant for decades, and even 
newcomers are made to feel like lifelong 
friends. 
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of Holiday Grill has 
given our community a reason to celebrate. 
Holiday Grill has provided a sense of comfort,

SPEECH OF 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of my amendment, floor 
amendment 272 in en bloc two, which pro-
vides clarity to a decades-long controversy 
about funding for Fleet Readiness Centers. 
These Naval facilities on Marine bases are 
major national security assets for the United 
States. My amendment would clarify that mili-
tary construction projects at FRCs, including 
FRC-East in my district, must be funded by 
the Department of the Navy rather than by the 
Marine Corps itself. FRCs are naval facilities 
that work on naval aircraft. That said, their 
construction projects should be paid for by the 
Department of the Navy. Military construction 
projects at FRCs have been starved for dec-
ades due to this bureaucratic confusion. 
Most of the industrial buildings at FRC-East 
are more than 50 years old because of this 
uncertainty. This lack of core investment can 
directly degrade the long-term readiness re-
lated to Marine Corps and Naval aviation. I 
thank the committee for including this amend-
ment and I urge my colleagues to support it 
en bloc.

HONORING LIEUTENANT GENERAL 
TODD T. SEMONITE 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, we 
rise today to honor an American who has 
made his life’s work to be of service to this 
country. It is our pleasure to honor Lieutenant 
General Todd Thurston Semonite, Com-
manding General and 54th Chief of the United 
States Army Corps of Engineers, on his mili-
tary retirement after three decades of service. 
We would like to thank him for his dedication 
to this nation, and his family for the personal 
sacrifices they have made for the betterment 
of our country. 
Lieutenant General Semonite’s many acco-
lades, awards, and achievements are already 
well known. He is an engineer from the start, 
a graduate of the United States Military Acad-
emy at West Point and was commissioned 
into the United States Army Corps of Engi-
neers upon graduation in 1979. General 
Semonite quickly gained recognition for his 
engineering skills and his leadership abilities 
as reflected in his various Command posts, 
domestic and abroad. Semonite’s awards in-
clude the Distinguished Service Medal, De-
fense Superior Service Award, Legion of Merit, 
and a Bronze Star. There are many defining 
moments in his outstanding career. Yet it is in

his 
last 
mission 
that 
maybe 
the 
most 
impactful. 
For the last few months, General Semonite 
has led the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ 
work to combat the COVID–19 global pan-
demic. The Corps has helped design or con-
struct alternate care facilities in all 50 states 
and five territories, adding over 15,000 hos-
pital 
beds 
across 
the 
country. 
General 
Semonite has said; ‘‘. . . of all the things I’ve 
done in my career, this is a noble calling to be 
able to step up and save American lives.’’ 
This extraordinary act of service is but ordi-
nary to General Semonite. His passion and 
vigor for the COVID–19 Mission is the same 
passion and vigor he has brought to every as-
pect of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He 
is the embodiment of ‘‘building strong.’’ We 
would like to express our own thanks and ap-
preciation and that of a grateful nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to 
join Rep. BRUCE WESTERMAN and me in giving 
our very best wishes to General Semonite and 
his wife Connie on the next chapter of an al-
ready storied life. Essayons.

HONORING THE LIFE AND UNSELF-
ISH WORK OF A ‘‘HAPPY WAR-
RIOR’’ ROY WEATHERFORD 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in admiration to honor the life and 
unselfish work of a ‘‘Happy Warrior’’ Roy 
Weatherford. Roy’s dedication to justice, 
equality, peace and worker rights is worthy of 
recognition. 
Roy’s significant contributions to society are 
rooted in his humble background. Raised in 
rural Arkansas with no electricity, education 
was always a top value for his family. While 
studying at Arkansas Technical University, he 
not only met his partner for life, Doris, but he 
found his causes for life—standing up for 
working people and against injustice. Roy saw 
firsthand the injustices of the Jim Crow era 
and was inspired by his professors to forgo his 
studies in math and physics in favor of philos-
ophy. And, when the administration fired those 
professors, in a scene that would be repeated 
often in Roy’s career, Roy and his friends ral-
lied and circulated petitions to show support 
for their beloved professors. Roy was not as 
successful as he would be later in life in this 
first foray challenging the powers that be, but 
he never quit fighting from those days forward. 
Roy graduated at the top of his class in 1964 
and he took a fellowship at Harvard University. 
A year later, he joined the army as a 
cryptanalyst just as the war in Vietnam was 
escalating. While still in the Army, on assign-
ment near the Pentagon, he and Doris were 
married. 
Roy returned to Harvard. Always a brilliant 
student, his master’s thesis won the Bechtel 
Prize in philosophy and he graduated with his 
doctorate in 1972. Roy decided to move to 
Tampa and join the faculty of the emerging 
University of South Florida (USF). Though he 
of course had other options, Roy felt that he 
could make a bigger impact on people’s lives 
at a small upstart school like USF than at a 
more established school in the Northeast. Roy 
observed that in Massachusetts and even Ar-
kansas, community leaders typically come 
from families that have long been dominant. 
Roy said, ‘‘in Florida, anybody who’s willing to 
work can make a difference.’’ New England’s 
loss was certainly Florida and Tampa’s gain, 
and through his hard work and the differences 
that he made, he proved his adage. 
Just two years after landing in Tampa, Roy 
was named the chair for the USF chapter of 
United Faculty Florida (UFF). A perfect fit for 
his energy, ability and conscience. He fought 
tirelessly to get more local control for unions 
and more resources for faculty and students. 
It has been said that he put a face on the fac-
ulty and made their needs real. After being 
elected union president in 2001, Roy worked 
until the union was saved. Typically, he went 
against the grain of the political landscape of 
the day, which was seeking to decertify 
unions. His efforts pressed those at the top to 
continue to recognize the faculty’s right to 
come together. And, when bargaining began 
locally for the first time, Roy’s astuteness, pas-
sion and commitment resulted in not only a 
contract but one including raises for faculty. 
He lobbied the state government to pass 
sweeping transformational laws, including Flor-
ida’s exceptional Government-in-the-Sunshine 
law and often worked on local and state com-
mittees focused on education and workers’ 
rights. Roy set the precedent for how USF and 
other university administrators work with edu-
cators, professors and organized labor. By the 
time of his retirement, union membership had 
doubled. Indeed, it has been said that many of 
UFF’s, USF’s and organized labor’s successes 
in Florida exist because of Roy’s advocacy. 
As a scholar, he wrote enthusiastically and 
intelligibility on world peace. As a person, Roy 
was a loving and tireless advocate for the 
same. Roy and Doris protested the Vietnam 
War and were active in many campaigns and 
causes—spending countless hours marching 
in support of civil and women’s rights. In Doris’ 
words, he was ‘‘concerned and passionate 
and principled.’’ 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors 
in Tampa Bay, Florida and citizens across the 
United States, I am proud to honor Roy 
Weatherford for his lifelong dedication to jus-
tice, working people and giving a voice to 
those who often were not allowed to have 
one. Roy showed us what service above self, 
passion, empathy, and action look like.

TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of en bloc No. 2 and my amendment 
in support of the Uyghur people. 
Millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic minori-
ties have been arbitrarily detained and forced 
by the Chinese government into ‘‘re-edu-
cation’’ and forced labor camps in Xinjiang. 
Under the label of ‘‘poverty alleviation,’’ 
Uyghurs are being assigned to factories in and 
outside of Xinjiang. These factories feed glob-
al supply chains that produce electronics, tex-
tiles, shoes, food products, and even PPE. 
According to a report from the Australian 
Strategic Policy Institute, some of the best- 
known brands in the world, including a number 
of U.S. companies, are unwittingly profiting 
from this scheme. 
U.S. law prohibits goods made using forced 
labor from entering our markets. However, 
Xinjiang accounts for 84 percent of the cotton 
produced in China, and is responsible for 1 in 
every 5 bales of cotton produced globally. Un-
less proactive measures are taken to prohibit 
sourcing from Xinjiang, U.S. companies risk 
being complicit in human rights abuses. 
My amendment would require DoD to create 
a process by which companies that sell goods 
in the commissary and exchange systems, 
that are partially or wholly manufactured from 
Xinjiang or with Xinjiang labor, to certify those 
goods were not manufactured using forced 
labor. 
Given the overwhelming evidence of wide- 
spread and systemic forced labor in China, as 
confirmed by testimony from camp survivors, 
satellite imagery, and leaked official docu-
ments, U.S. companies that import from the 
region should have already taken proactive 
measures to audit suppliers. 
For companies that haven’t, under my 
amendment, they will be required to do so if 
they want to continue selling their products on 
our military bases. I urge my colleagues to 
support this important amendment.

SPEECH OF 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to Division F, the Cor-
porate Transparency Act provision, within 
Amendment 499 to H.R. 6395, the William M. 
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021. 
This amendment is part of a larger of pack-
age of amendments that the House is voting 
for en bloc. Many of those provisions I sup-
port. I would like to emphasize that my re-
marks only apply to certain provisions within 
Amendment 499. 
Specifically, I do not support Division F of 
the amendment which is the text that relates 
to H.R. 2513 which passed the House floor on 
October 22, 2019. The legislation addresses 
how we might combat illicit finance activities 
through the collection of beneficial ownership 
information. 
I did not support the legislation when it 
passed the House floor, and I do not support 
it as a provision in amendment 499. In fact, I 
have long advocated against this policy since 
I was elected to Congress over five years ago. 
The collection of beneficial ownership has 
been debated in Congress for a long time as 
the ability to set up legal entities without accu-
rate beneficial ownership information, has long 
represented a key vulnerability in the U.S. fi-
nancial system. 
Congresswoman MALONEY, the leader of the 
legislation, has been trying to pass a bill that 
would collect beneficial ownership for over a 
decade.

I agree that knowing where money is com-
ing from, where it is going, and in whose hand 
it sits is vital to U.S. national security. 
However, I cannot support the text as writ-
ten as it places significant burden on small 
businesses. The legislation creates a new reg-
ulatory database within Financial Crimes En-
forcement Network (FinCEN), a law enforce-
ment unit, which most small businesses have 
never even heard of. And, even more alarm-
ing, if they don’t comply, they could face a 
penalty of up to $10,000 and a prison sen-
tence of up to 3 years. 
This could create significant unintended 
consequences for a large portion of the 
economy’s commerce. 
I believe there is a better path forward, 
which is why I have long supported aligning 
tax filings with collection of beneficial owner-
ship information—a regulation small busi-
nesses already understand. 
Furthermore, it is critical to note that the 
beneficial ownership information is already re-
quired and is already being collected. The 
Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rule, which 
took effect in May 2018 requires banksto iden-
tify and verify the identity of the beneficial 
owners of companies opening accounts. 
The CDD rule is operational and effective. 
Why would we upend this regulation, that has 
been working for over two years, to place un-
necessary burdens on our local dry cleaners, 
our farming community, or the realtor that sold 
you your house, or any other small business? 
These are the types of individuals that will 
have to comply FinCEN, an organization they 
have never heard of, if this amendment be-
comes law. 
We should be able to find a solution to col-
lect this information that alleviates the bank 
burden while not subjecting small businesses 
to unnecessarily complicated reporting require-
ments. 
For these reasons, I cannot support Ms. 
MALONEY’s amendment.

TRIBUTE TO MASTER GUNNERY 
SERGEANT KENNETH PINCKARD 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Master Gun-
nery Sergeant Kenneth Pinckard in honor of 
his retirement from the Marine Corps after 28 
faithful and honorable years of service. He 
spent his career supporting strategic intel-
ligence operations, analyzing the enemy’s in-
tentions on the homefront and abroad, thus 
thwarting multiple enemy attacks and saving 
countless civilian and military lives in between. 
Master Gunnery Sergeant Pinckard, a fear-
less leader, played an instrumental role in the 
development and recruitment of Marines com-
ing into the command. All the freedoms we 
enjoy today are because of these brave men 
and women in uniform, like Master Gunnery 
Sergeant Pinckard, who so unselfishly and 
courageously put their lives in harm’s way for 
their fellow brothers and sisters. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the retirement of this selfless Marine. I wish 
Master Gunnery Sergeant Pinckard and his 
family all the peace and blessings as they em-
bark on this next journey together.

Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to Patrice Brand and 
Erin Doty on being named principals in Lex-
ington-Richland School District Five. Together 
they bring over 40 years of experience to the 
school district for the students. 
Patrice Brand has served as assistant prin-
cipal of instruction at the Academy For Suc-
cess since 2019. Prior to that job, she served 
as assistant principal at a middle school and 
a high school in Charlotte, N.C. She replaces 
Danielle Major-Murphy, who was named the 
new principal of Irmo Middle School. 
Erin Doty previously served as the assistant 
principal of instruction at Irmo Middle School. 
She also served as assistant principal at 
Dutch Fork Middle School from August 2013 
to June 2017. Doty replaces Justin Thomas, 
who was named the district’s new coordinator 
of student information systems. 
They have set the standard of excellence in 
their community through their work, and I wish 
them the best in their new positions.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to the FY 2021 National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
Our country is going through turbulent 
times. 
People are taking to the streets to cry out 
for real justice and an end to racism that per-
vades so many institutions in our country, not 
just the police or criminal justice system. 
They are crying out for investments in soci-
ety; in education, social services, housing, and 
healthcare. 
Over the weekend, we lost one of our true 
champions for justice and equality, and a true 
leader a remarkable human being, Congress-
man John Lewis, who I was privileged to call 
a friend. 
A deadly pandemic has killed over 140,000 
Americans in nearly four months, and cases 
are still surging, setting new records almost 
daily in the last few weeks. Yet, the President 
continues to dissemble, disengage, and dimin-
ish the threat of this pandemic, despite the ad-
vice of our nation’s public health experts and 
the obvious and immediate need for a credible 
and strong federal response and leadership. 
That’s what this moment is calling for . . . 
Leadership. Not more of the same. 
But what we have here before us today 
folks is legislation that won’t invest in a single 
meal for a hungry child, a vaccine for the pan-
demic, or help for the homeless or those 
about to lose their homes. Furthermore, the 
bill, in my opinion, is a retreat by Congress 
from its power to protect the power of the 
purse and our war powers. 
I recognize and appreciate the work of 
Chairman SMITH and his committee on this 
legislation. I know that countless hours of 
hearings, testimony, and a long markup went 
into putting together this bill. 
However, anyway you slice it, the Penta-
gon’s budget has increased dramatically since 
September 11, 2001. The war in Afghanistan 
is the longest conflict in our nation’s history 
and it shows little sign of ending, even with a 
supposed peace deal in hand. 
I support the amendment put forward by Mr. 
POCAN that would cut the defense budget 
while still providing for our national defense. 
The amendment would exempt the Defense 
Health Programs and Military Personnel Ac-
counts from any cuts. 
We cannot continue to mindlessly push for-
ward defense budgets that are out of line with 
the threats that face our nation or the needs 
of our country. The U.S. spends more money 
than any other country on our military, but can 
any American look around and say with a 
clear conscious that all that spending has pro-
duced more peace, more world stability, or 
better overall outcomes for Americans, or our 
global brothers and sisters? 
All this treasure we throw at defense is not 
even helping the military itself, as a series of 
incidents over the past year has raised con-
cerns about readiness. 
In fact, we appear to be spending more and 
more money on defense, yet our forces are 
less and less prepared, and it is taking longer 
and more money to deploy weapons systems. 
As noted by a bipartisan group of House 
members nearly a decade ago, ‘‘We know the 
United States can maintain the best fighting 
force in the world while also pursuing sensible 
defense savings. How we spend our re-
sources is just as important as how much we 
spend.’’ 
Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, 
who served under both Republicans and 
Democrats, put it succinctly: ‘‘We must come 
to realize that not every defense program is 
necessary, not every defense dollar is scared 
and well-spent, and that more of nearly every-
thing is simply not sustainable’’ especially at a 
time when ‘‘the gap between the U.S. military 
and the rest of the world . . . will continue to 
be vast.’’ 
I would also have liked to support the Scha-
kowsky amendment on Iran; unfortunately, it 
was not made in order. Last year, the House 
voted at least three times, including on the FY 
2020 NDAA, about the need to prevent a 
needless war with Iran and to reclaim our war 
powers to ensure that any such decision prop-
erly remains the provenance of Congress. 
I am grateful that the House Appropriations 
Committee recently adopted an amendment to 
its FY 2021 Defense Appropriations bill to stop 
a needless war with Iran absent formal con-
gressional authority. But we need to take 
every opportunity to make clear how dan-
gerous any ill-advised war with Iran would be. 
Given a President who’s decision-making is as 
reckless as it is illinformed, this Congress 
must consistently push for an end to esca-
lation and saber rattling and instead to work 
towards immediate diplomatic solutions. This 
bill is a missed opportunity, one I hope that we 
do not come back to regret.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF HARVEY WILLIAM SEXTON 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of Harvey William 
Sexton, who passed away at the age of 87 
after a lifetime of service to his fellow Ameri-
cans. Through his extreme courage and self-
lessness, Harvey became an indispensable 
part of the state of Michigan. 
Harvey was born on August 12, 1932. After 
completing 11th grade at Brethren High 
School, Harvey enlisted in the United States 
Army to fight in the Korean War. There he 
served with distinction in the Armored Tank 
Division, earning the Army Occupation Medal 
for Japan, Korean Service Medal, United Na-
tions Service Medal for Korea, and four 
Bronze Stars—including one for Valorous 
Service. At 18 he was promoted to corporal, 
and at 20 he was honorably discharged at the 
rank of Sergeant. Following his military serv-
ice, Harvey married his wife Marla in July of 
1953. The two of them would go on to raise 
a family of eight children. 
Harvey passed away on April 17, 2020. He 
is missed dearly by his family and friends, and 
his legacy will undoubtedly live on for genera-
tions to come. Harvey’s tireless devotion to 
the public good touched the lives of countless 
Michiganders, and the impact of his work can-
not be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Harvey William Sex-
ton. His legacy will forever live on in his family 
and through the countless lives he bettered 
through his service.

HONORING JOE GUNTER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in mourning to celebrate the life of the late 
Mayor of Salinas, California, Joseph David 
Gunter, for a lifetime of public service to both 
his community and our country. Mayor Gunter, 
a longtime resident and public servant of Sali-
nas, passed away on June 29, 2020. It is with 
deep sadness that I stand here on the House 
floor today to honor Mayor Gunter’s life and 
contributions. 
Born into a military family in Maryland, Joe 
and his family eventually moved to Fort Ord, 
a former Army base on the central coast of 
California. After graduating from a local High 
School, Joe joined the U.S. Marine Corps and 
served honorably for four years during the 
Vietnam War. Joe’s military service shaped his 
life and led to a lifelong career guided by a 
sense of duty and service to his community. 
Soon after returning home, Joe joined the Sa-
linas Police Department, serving six years as 
a patrol officer and another twenty-six as a de-
tective. Joe’s strong leadership skills and com-
mitment to public service led him to become 
Mayor of Salinas, a position in which he 
served for eight years. 
During his time as Mayor, Joe spearheaded 
many projects in Salinas and throughout Mon-
terey County. Some of these projects include 
development of the new Salinas Police De-
partment and Youth Alisal Sports Fields, con-
struction of housing for homeless and low-in-
come residents, leading the Veteran’s Day Pa-
rade, and playing a critical role in advance-
ment of the California Central Coast Veteran’s 
Cemetery at Fort Ord. The initiatives that Joe 
led will undoubtably have a lasting impact on 
individual residents and the broader commu-
nity for generations to come. 
Joe’s community service expanded far be-
yond his mayoral duties. He also found time to 
serve as the Director of Security for the Sali-
nas Rodeo and California International Air-
show, served as President and volunteer at 
the Salinas Women’s Crisis Center, and was 
President and a coach of the Bobby Sox Soft-
ball League. Joe’s extensive service to the 
community and country for more than fifty 
years is an inspiration to us all, and I am both 
proud and honored to have had the oppor-
tunity to serve alongside him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
celebrating the life of the late Mayor Joe Gun-
ter and offering our sincere condolences to his 
wife, children, and grandchildren as they, 
alongside the community, mourn the loss of a 
truly special man.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, today, I voted 
against the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2021. While this legislation in-
cludes several provisions that I strongly sup-
port—including prohibiting the use of funds to 
support the Saudi-led coalition for strikes in 
Yemen and limiting the President’s ability to 
divert funds to build his wasteful border wall— 
it ultimately fails to rein in our nation’s out of 
control defense spending. 
Amid a global pandemic, and at a time 
when our nation’s poverty rate is at least 25 
percent, it is unconscionable that Congress is 
authorizing a record-breaking Pentagon budg-
et of $740.5 billion—over half of our discre-
tionary budget. Multiple independent analyses 
have concluded that our nation’s collective se-
curity would not suffer by cutting obsolete cold 
war weapon systems, rejecting new nuclear 
weapons, and ending our military’s reliance on 
expensive private contractors. Congress must 
confront this reality and take meaningful action 
to ensure that the basic needs of American 
families are prioritized over wasteful military 
spending. That’s why I’m deeply disappointed 
that an amendment I supported to reduce the 
Pentagon’s budget by ten percent—while ex-
empting military personnel and the Defense 
Health Program from any reduction—was de-
feated on the House floor. 
While I oppose the wasteful spending in-
cluded in this legislation, I am pleased that it 
authorizes a three percent military pay raise 
and contains provisions to protect the health 
of military families by cleaning so-called PFAS 
forever chemicals and investing in military 
housing infrastructure improvements. The bill 
also takes important steps to improve the 
tracking of military child abuse cases, improve 
sexual assault prevention and response, and 
require that the DoD procure body armor that 
properly fits female service members. I am 
also pleased that the bill takes meaningful ac-
tion to close the detention facility at Guanta-
namo Bay—an issue I have long cham-
pioned—by eliminating arbitrary restrictions on 
the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo 
Bay that hindered the Obama Administration’s 
ability to close the facility. 
Although I am glad these important provi-
sions were included, I could not and cannot 
support a bill that ensures our nation will pro-
vide $550 billion more in discretionary funding 
for military spending than for healthcare, edu-
cation, workforce development, and anti-pov-
erty programs combined.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLO-
NEL 
LAURA 
WANG, 
UNITED 
STATES ARMY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Laura Wang for 
her exemplary dedication to duty and service 
as a Congressional Budget Liaison for the As-
sistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Man-
agement and Comptroller). Lieutenant Colonel 
Wang is transitioning from her present assign-
ment for her continued service in the U.S. 
Army. 
A native of Grosselle, Michigan, Lieutenant 
Colonel Wang was commissioned as a Med-
ical Service Corps officer after her graduation 
from the University of Toledo, with a Bachelor 
of Science degree in Pharmacy Management. 
She has also earned a Master’s degree in 
Legislative Affairs from the George Wash-
ington University. 
Lieutenant Colonel Wang has served in a 
broad range of assignments during her Army 
career. She served in Germany from 2003 to 
2007 with the 501st Combat Support Battalion 
as the Ambulance Platoon Leader, Medical 
Operations Officer, and Battalion Adjutant. 
She then transitioned to an assignment at 
Walter Reed from 2007 to 2011. During this 
assignment she was selected as the Alpha 
Company Commander for the Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center. Subsequently she 
transitioned to a comptroller, and the garrison 
resource manager at Walter Reed. Following 
this assignment, Lieutenant Colonel Wang 
was assigned to the Office of the Surgeon 
General for the United States Army, from 2011 
to 2014. Here she was first assigned as a Re-
source Program Officer, and then worked in 
Congressional Relations. Upon completion of 
her duties, she transitioned to the U.S. Army 
Medical Research Institute of Disease located 
at Fort Dietrich from 2016 to 2018 where she 
performed duties as a comptroller. Lieutenant 
Colonel Wang has deployed twice to Iraq in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
In 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Wang was as-
signed as a Congressional Budget Liaison for 
the U.S. Army’s Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Financial Management and Comp-
troller, managing the Army’s medical portfolio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

July 21, 2020 
Lieutenant Colonel Wang worked tirelessly 
with Members of Congress and their staffs to 
accurately articulate the Army’s budget posi-
tion to the Appropriations Committees. Her 
professionalism, diligence, and commitment to 
the mission are unmatched. Her work as a liai-
son very effectively represented the U.S. Army 
and the Department of Defense to the United 
States Congress. 
The footing of Laura’s military success is 
her family. She is a devoted wife to her hus-
band, Stephen, and committed mother to her 
daughter Claire Yvonne. Stephen and Claire 
provide the foundation for Laura’s service. The 
Wang’s attitude of service, sacrifice, and care 
for others permeates every organization and 
activity in which they participate. They are true 
examples of servant leaders in the Army and 
the communities they engage. 
Throughout her career, Lieutenant Colonel 
Wang has positively impacted soldiers, peers, 
and superiors. Our country has benefited tre-
mendously from her extraordinary leadership, 
judgment, and passion. I join my colleagues 
today in honoring her dedication to our Nation 
and invaluable service to the United States 
Congress as an Army Congressional Liaison. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine 
pleasure to have worked with Lieutenant Colo-
nel Wang. On behalf of a grateful nation, this 
body recognizes and commends Laura for her 
service to our country. We wish her all the 
best as she continues her service in the 
United States Army.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JEFF 
HUCKABY 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
ORGANIC TRADE ASSOCIATION’S 
ORGANIC FARMER OF THE YEAR 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mr. Jeff Huckaby, 
President of Grimm way Farms and Cal Or-
ganic, for being named the Organic Trade As-
sociation’s Organic Farmer of the Year. 
A fourth-generation farmer, Jeff was born 
and raised in the small town of Arvin, in the 
southernmost tip of California’s Central Valley. 
He first got his start with farming at the age of 
11 when he would wake up at the crack of 
dawn to help on his grandfather’s farm. He 
began his official career with Grimm way in 
1999 and it wasn’t long before he started his 
work with organic farming when in 2000 as 
farm manager, he took over all of Grimrnway’s 
organic production in California. He would 
later become general manager of Cal Organic 
Farm after its purchase by Grimrnway. 
Under 
his 
guidance 
and 
leadership 
Grimmway’s Cal Organic has grown to be the 
largest carrot company in the world and the 
largest organic vegetable company in the na-
tion. With over 65 items grown in over 45,000 
acres throughout several states, Cal Organic 
can proudly say that 100 percent of its 
produce is grown in the United States. This 
true American company has accomplished the 
outstanding feats of being the largest supplier 
of organic vegetables to Whole Foods and 
Albertsons/Vons, providing most of the organic 
carrots sold by Walmart and Kroeger, and 
growing every carrot Costco sells in the U.S. 
and in several other countries. 
Through his work Jeff has garnered a well- 
earned reputation for his expertise in organic 
farming. Many have sought his knowledge in-
cluding the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, The U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, as well as the House Agriculture Com-
mittee where he has testified about the role 
and importance of organic production. 
I am honored to congratulate Jeff on this 
well-deserved recognition of his unparalleled 
work ethic, countless achievements, and his 
outstanding role in organic farming and in the 
agriculture industry overall.

HONORING EDDIE GALE 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a musical icon and celebrated 
community member, Eddie Gale, who passed 
away on July 10, 2020. Since making his 
home in San Jose in 1972, he enriched many 
lives through his music and community in-
volvement. 
An accomplished jazz musician and trum-
peter, Eddie Gale, grew up in New York. He 
was the third of five children of Edward and 
Daisy Stevens. His young life was filled with 
music, from gospel at Rose Hill Baptist 
Church, to his Cub Scout’s marching band 
where he played the bugle, to his lessons with 
jazz legend, Kenny Dorham. In the early 
1960s, Eddie Gale joined Sun Ra’s Arkestra 
and released two Blue Note albums in 1968 
and 1969. Throughout his career, he played 
alongside acclaimed jazz figures including 
John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor, Jackie McLean, 
Larry Young, Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, and Max 
Roach. 
After moving to the West Coast, Eddie Gale 
started to focus on teaching and sharing 
music with local youths. He was an Artist in 
Residence at Stanford and San Jose State 
University. He also worked with Monroe Mid-
dle 
School, 
McClymonds 
High 
School, 
EastSide Arts Alliance, and Black Dot Artists 
Collective. To create spaces where music 
could thrive, he helped establish the Ever-
green Youth Adult Jazz Society, the We’re 
Jazzed! Youth/Adult Jazz Festival and the an-
nual Concert for World Peace and Peace Po-
etry Contest. 
Mr. Gale was an important part of Bay Area 
music culture and was known as ‘‘San Jose’s 
Ambassador of Jazz.’’ He was also named an 
Ambassador of Music, from the Association of 
World Citizens, San Francisco. 
His dedication to sharing music was well 
known in the Bay Area. He received the Jef-
ferson Award for community service in the arts 
and received the Sankofa Award from the 
California Arts Council for 25 years of service 
in the arts for training youth and adults in 
music. In the community, he coordinated the 
giveaway of trumpets and helped raise money 
for the Bay Area Jazz Musicians Self-Help 
Healthcare Project. 
Eddie Gale made a lasting impression on 
our community through his music and service 
to others. He is survived by his wife, Geor-
gette, three of his siblings, his six children, 12 
grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren. I 
enjoyed the many times I was able to talk with 
Eddie and to enjoy his music. I join Mr. Gale’s 
family, colleagues, and our neighbors in ex-
pressing my great sense of loss and apprecia-
tion for the 78 years he shared with us. He will 
be dearly missed but he leaves our community 
and world a better place.
