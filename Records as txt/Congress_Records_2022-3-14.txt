UKRAINE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
Thursday, I decided to join with Sen-
ator SHAHEEN and set up a meeting 
with about 13 European Ambassadors 
to the United States. It was for the 
Democratic Senators. Afterward, we 
thought this should have been bipar-
tisan, and the next one will be. 
But the Ambassadors’ meeting was 
nothing short of historic because these 
14 Ambassadors, representing the obvi-
ous leaders in Europe, all spoke to the 
issue of Ukraine and what it has meant 
to them and what it has done to their 
nations. 
Some of their statements were pro-
found. The Ambassador from Germany 
talked about how her country had, in a 
matter 
of 
2 
weeks, 
dramatically 
changed its position on many issues: 
On the future of the Nord Stream 2 
pipeline, they have come to realize 
that dependence on Russia is risky 
business in the 21st century; whether 
or not Germany will step up and sup-
port the Ukrainian people. They de-
cided they would, and they also decided 
that they would make a substantial in-
vestment in military spending as part 
of NATO. 
Some of those things seem like very 
common decisions to Americans, but 
for them, it was many times a reversal 
of a party position. They have come to 
realize, as we have around the world, 
that the Ukrainian situation calls for 
emergency measures. 
I first want to commend President 
Joe Biden. Though I may not agree 
with all his policies and approaches, I 
have to say that at the moment in his-
tory we find ourselves, thank goodness 
Joe Biden is our President. I cannot 
imagine his predecessor in a similar 
circumstance. 
Joe Biden set out to first unify 
NATO. It sounds like an easy task. It is 
an alliance which we inspired back in 
the 1940s, after World War II, and have 
been an active leader in for decades. 
But our relationship with the nations 
of NATO and Europe and our relation-
ship to the world as a NATO alliance

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1136 
March 14, 2022 
had suffered greatly in the last few 
years. Joe Biden set out to change 
that, and he is the man to do it. 
Throughout his career in the Senate 
and as Vice President to President 
Obama, he played a major role in for-
eign policy. He was no stranger to 
many of the people he sat down with in 
the NATO alliance. He brought them 
together and impressed upon them 
that, if Putin should decide to invade 
Ukraine, the NATO alliance had to be 
stronger than ever. He convinced them, 
and we should recognize that. Both 
parties should recognize that. His lead-
ership brought NATO into the 21st cen-
tury and brought it to the stage where 
it can confront this Putin threat in a 
responsible manner. 
This is being felt across the world, 
but it is being felt particularly in the 
nations that are on the border of 
Ukraine or Belarus. 
At this meeting of the Ambassadors, 
I called on the Ambassador from Po-
land. I will have to admit and concede 
that I have a bias there because I rep-
resent the second largest Polish city in 
the world, Chicago, IL, second only to 
Warsaw. There are many fine Polish 
people there, and there have been for 
many generations, who are following 
this closely, realizing that they are 
right on the edge, right next to 
Ukraine. 
The Ambassador made some com-
ments that I thought were worth re-
peating on the floor. At that time, 
about 11⁄2 million refugees—11⁄2 million 
refugees—had flown or come across the 
border into Poland, and they were 
being absorbed and accepted in that 
country—11⁄2
million. He said some-
thing that was noteworthy. 
He said: If you watch the TV of the 
people coming to the train stations and 
across the border, did you notice there 
are no refugee camps in Poland for the 
Ukrainians? Those people who come 
across the border are being brought 
into the homes of Polish families. They 
are taking the spare bedroom or find-
ing a way to get by in homes of people 
who care for them—11⁄2 million. Now, 
some go on to other countries, but 
many are staying in Poland. 
Then he said something which has 
historic significance. He said: We are 
taking care of these people because in 
1939, no one would take care of us. 
He is, of course, referring to the inva-
sion of Poland by the Nazis and the 
subjugation of the Polish population 
after a valiant effort to stop the Nazi 
advance and then the hardship and suf-
fering of the Polish people under Nazi 
rule. They remember that. Few were 
personally alive to remember, but fam-
ilies have repeated the stories over and 
over again. 
My hat is off to the Polish people for 
their kindness and caring and their 
leadership when it comes to accepting 
refugees. But what a lesson for us and 
for the rest of the world. Countries 
around Europe are each accepting re-
sponsibility. 
This was a big weekend in Chicago. It 
is St. Patrick’s Day weekend. We dyed 
the river green—lots of parties, lots of 
fun, events at churches like Old St. 
Patrick’s and others. It is a tradition 
which I am really fond to be part of 
each year. 
I noticed when I spoke to the Irish 
American Partnership on Friday morn-
ing how many people were asking me 
about Ukraine. At a time when we usu-
ally just have a lot of fun and remem-
ber good times involving Irish parties 
and Irish families, there was a real con-
cern about Ukraine—and not just in 
Chicago among the Irish but equally 
important in Ireland among the Irish, 
because several things have happened 
in the last few days in Ireland. 
They have been gathering thousands 
of pounds of medical supplies and hu-
manitarian aid and shipping them over 
to Ukraine through Poland and other 
countries. They really care. Then they 
made a commitment. Ireland—a nation 
of 5 million people—made a commit-
ment to take 100,000 Ukrainian refu-
gees. 
I said to the group that I met with on 
Friday morning: A lesson for us all. 
This isn’t the first time we have seen 
refugees in the world; it is the current 
refugee crisis, and it is ongoing in 
many other parts of the world. And 
what a lesson for us all—regardless of 
our religious affiliation, that if we do 
care for our fellow man, we should care 
for these refugees. They are the strang-
ers, as often referred to in Christian 
teaching, whom we are asked to accept. 
So I want to commend the Polish 
people, the Hungarians, the Roma-
nians, the Moldovans for accepting ref-
ugees as they have from Ukraine. It is 
a tragedy that it is necessary, but 
thank goodness there are caring people 
in those countries who do open their 
homes and their lives to the refugees. 
There was a conversation as well 
from other Ambassadors that day, but 
the message that came through dra-
matically was that we are now unified. 
The NATO alliance and other countries 
in Europe, like Sweden and Finland 
and Switzerland, although they are not 
part of the NATO alliance, really care 
and want to be part of the response to 
it. That is the strength of the force 
against Vladimir Putin. But the real 
strength is in Ukraine itself. 
How can you watch the television 
and see the devastation that is taking 
place and not feel for the people who 
are still remaining there, the millions 
who each day wake up and wonder if 
that is the last day of their life because 
of a Russian missile or a Russian bomb 
or because Vladimir Putin has decided 
to engage in a scorched-earth policy? 
When they bombed maternity hos-
pitals, I thought they had reached the 
lowest possible point, but over the 
weekend, Vladimir Putin intensified 
his 
illegal, 
unprovoked 
war 
on 
Ukraine—shelling apartment buildings, 
hospitals, schools, creating an obscene 
body of evidence that Vladimir Putin 
should be charged and convicted of the 
worst possible war crimes. 
That is why I had to hesitate for a 
moment and say, when I hear apolo-
gists for Putin in America, I wonder 
who they are and what they are made 
of. Tucker Carlson is one who even the 
Russians are recommending that their 
friends in the media listen to, making 
excuses on FOX for Vladimir Putin. 
There are no excuses—none accept-
able—on 
the 
subject. 
Mr. 
Carlson 
should be ashamed of himself. 
It is impossible to know how many 
innocent civilians have already died in 
Ukraine. Estimates run from hundreds 
to thousands. An estimated 2.8 million 
Ukrainians—almost 
all 
of 
them 
women, children, and the elderly—have 
fled in the bitter cold to other nations, 
carrying one or two suitcases and a 
backpack and a baby on their side. Mil-
lions more Ukrainian citizens are dis-
placed inside Ukraine—we can’t even 
count that number—and multitudes 
are trapped in places like Mariupol and 
other cities under siege by Russia. 
Many of them are without food and 
water and medicine and electricity. 
These families are coming to shelters 
and saying: We have no food to give our 
children. That is how desperate the cir-
cumstances are because of Mr. Putin’s 
invasion. His unprovoked war is a war 
of atrocities. 
Yesterday, I attended a rally at the 
Ukrainian Center in Chicago. It had 
been chilly the day before, but it 
warmed up into the 50s—which is good 
news in Chicago in March—and we were 
outside. Quite a crowd showed up. 
There were more blue and gold Ukrain-
ian flags than I had seen in any one 
place in America, but there were many 
other flags too. There were Polish 
flags; and I am proud to say there were 
Lithuanian flags—my mother’s home-
land—Estonian, 
Latvian, 
American 
flags, all gathered to show unity with 
the Ukrainian people. 
Since this war started, they have 
been working to provide aid shipments 
and 
to 
reach 
family 
members 
in 
Ukraine. You can tell that it is taking 
its toll on them as they talk about 
members of their families that are still 
in Ukraine today. 
But people came with a loud round of 
applause when I announced that we 
had, on the floor of the Senate last 
week on Thursday, passed a bill to pro-
vide $13.6 billion to Ukraine—humani-
tarian aid, military aid. And President 
Biden, over the weekend, talked about 
another $200 million worth of direct 
military aid. That makes it over $1 bil-
lion that America has sent, and there 
is more to follow. 
We 
talked 
about 
the 
sanctions 
against Russia, sanctions which will be 
felt by the common people of Russia. 
Unfortunately, some of them are inno-
cent victims in this as well, but it will 
put pressure on Putin to finally stop 
this deadly invasion. 
They said—and I believe—that this is 
not simply a war on Ukraine; it is a 
war on democracy. It is a war on civili-
zation. 
On Wednesday, we are going to have 
a historic moment here in the Capitol.

March 14, 2022 
President of Ukraine, will address a 
joint session of Congress using the re-
mote technology. We are all in awe of 
his courage and leadership, and we are 
anxious to hear his message, to think 
of what that man has achieved by stay-
ing on the scene, regularly broad-
casting videos to show that he was still 
there. He inspires his people to get up 
and fight for Ukraine. 
Our message to him on that day is 
‘‘Slava Ukraini!’’—that is, ‘‘Glory to 
Ukraine.’’ And it is a phrase that was 
actually banished during Soviet times 
because it was so nationalistic that the 
Soviets didn’t want the people of that 
country using it. They use it proudly 
today because they are an independent, 
free, and democratic nation. 
America stands with Ukraine in its 
fight for democracy and civilization. I 
just hope that we will learn many les-
sons from this. Don’t many of the 
things which we were arguing about in 
America seem so trivial in comparison 
to what we are talking about in 
Ukraine: truckers coming to protest 
social distancing and masks and vac-
cine mandates? I am sure those are im-
portant issues, but they pale in com-
parison to the life-and-death struggle 
which is going on in Ukraine. 
These people understand that they 
must be ready to stand and die for 
their freedom. How many of us could 
rise to that level if challenged? It is 
something I think about a lot. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Madam President, on another topic, 2 
years ago—March 13, 2020—President 
Trump officially declared COVID a na-
tional emergency in America. We all 
remember the dark and uncertain days 
in the early spring of 2020. Overnight, 
schools, offices, and businesses closed 
their doors and opened their Zooms. 
Today is also an important anniver-
sary in America’s recovery. One year 
ago today—1 year ago—Democrats in 
Congress passed the American Rescue 
Plan, our comprehensive plan to help 
American 
families, 
hospitals, 
and 
small businesses weather the economic 
hardship of the pandemic and to dis-
tribute vaccines and medical equip-
ment so that we could get the pan-
demic behind us and return to normal 
life in America. 
The pandemic has affected every-
body: 
Republicans, 
Democrats, 
and 
people who don’t care at all about poli-
tics. Sadly, however, the American 
Rescue Plan only passed with Demo-
cratic votes. Not a single Republican 
would vote for it, in the House or in 
the Senate. 
And it worked. We were right. It was 
needed. The U.S. economy has recov-
ered faster and stronger from this pan-
demic than any other G–7 nation in the 
world. America’s economy added more 
than 6 million new jobs in the year 
since we passed the American Rescue 
Plan. That is a record. 
Part of the reason our economy is 
strong today is because that plan made 
wise decisions that helped families, 
helped businesses, and helped commu-
nities through the worst time when the 
pandemic forced businesses and schools 
to close. The American Rescue Plan 
provided a critical lifeline to low-in-
come families, stabilized middle-class 
families by providing enhanced child 
tax credits, and expanded unemploy-
ment insurance and housing relief. 
That plan also closed the holes to pro-
vide help for families with children, ex-
panding the earned income tax credit 
and child tax credit. 
In particular, the enhanced child tax 
credit gave working families a chance 
to breathe. They used it to buy the ba-
sics—groceries, diapers—pay the util-
ity bills, pay the rent, pay the mort-
gage. Some of us just take that all for 
granted. For many people, it is a pay-
check-to-paycheck 
challenge. 
Some 
families actually finally paid down 
their debts. Others put a few dollars 
away for the next emergency. 
Now, they are feeling squeezed again, 
those same families. That doesn’t mean 
we were mistaken when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan. It means we 
have more to do to lower the cost of 
living for families across the United 
States. This should be done on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
Inflation is a global problem, not 
simply an American problem. It is a re-
flection of the world labor market and 
a global supply chain basically dis-
rupted by a pandemic and still in the 
process of recovery. 
Now, we have made a decision as a 
nation to ban imports of Russian oil. 
Seventy-nine percent of the American 
people support that decision, even 
though they understand that it will 
drive up the price of gasoline. They 
don’t want their hard-earned American 
dollars paying for Vladimir Putin’s 
war, killing the innocent people of 
Ukraine. I salute them for their cour-
age in joining our Nation together in 
that effort to stop it. 
Yes, it will add more to the price of 
oil. It already has over the last week or 
two because of Putin’s invasion, but we 
have got to face a reality. To stop the 
killing and death in Ukraine, we have 
to be prepared to make some sacrifice. 
Inflation is a real problem. We need 
real solutions, not just complaints. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. NGOZI EZIKE 
Madam 
President, 
my 
remaining 
statement is a tribute to an extraor-
dinary individual, a lady who is a doc-
tor and was the head of the Illinois De-
partment of Public Health during the 
worst part of the pandemic. 
Her name is Dr. Ngozi Ezike. I saw 
her on TV every day when I was back 
home during the pandemic, and she was 
such an inspiring person, so talented. 
She was calm. She was wise. She was 
compassionate. And she was profes-
sional. She really made life bearable 
during an unbearable time. She saved 
lives. 
A Harvard-trained, board-certified in-
ternist and pediatrician, she worked at 
all levels of public health. For the last 
3 years, she has been our State’s top 
doctor. She had been in that post for a 
little over a year when COVID hit. We 
were lucky she was there. 
Directors of State health depart-
ments usually work outside the public 
spotlight. She was in the spotlight 
every day. Appearing with Governor JB 
Pritzker in his daily briefings, she was 
the public face of Illinois’ effort to con-
tain the virus and save lives. What a 
reassuring 
presence. 
She 
dispensed 
daily doses of compassion and empathy 
along with the facts and statistics, the 
realities, pleas for mask wearing and 
handwashing. She delivered her mes-
sage calmly, clearly, and then, without 
missing a beat, delivered it again in 
Spanish. 
Her sincerity was obvious and never 
more so than at a news conference 
about 7 months into the pandemic 
when she broke down as she was deliv-
ering the day’s grim statistics. She 
paused to regain her composure and 
then urged Illinois residents to fight 
the fatigue and keep doing what is 
needed to protect themselves and each 
other from the virus. After seeing that 
on television, I wrote her a fan letter, 
and many others did too. She really 
cared. 
Two weeks ago, she was at another 
news conference with the Governor. 
With the number of Illinois residents 
hospitalized with COVID below 1,000 for 
3 days for the first time since last Au-
gust, the Governor said it was time to 
lift our mask mandate, time to move 
toward normal life in Illinois. 
Dr. Ezike surprised everybody by an-
nouncing that she was going to return 
to normal life herself; she was leaving 
her position. In announcing her deci-
sion, she thanked her husband and four 
kids ‘‘for tolerating the absences, the 
last-minute changes in plans, the end-
less multitasking and the ever-present 
cellphones.’’ And she added: 
Now it’s time— 
She said to her family— 
to make you my priority and give back a 
portion of the encouragement and support 
that you have lavished on me. 
She thanked the people of Illinois 
‘‘for their sacrifices’’ and asked we con-
tinue to show each other compassion 
and tolerance. She remembered the 
nearly 33,000 people in our State who 
have died of COVID since the begin-
ning, and she said: 
All of the people and all of their stories, I 
will carry always in my heart. 
And she said: 
I’m so blessed to have been able to bring 
some measure of comfort to Illinoisans, to 
quiet some of the chaos and to infuse some 
calm. 
Dr. Ezike, I would say that the bless-
ing was ours. 
As the first Black woman ever to 
head the Illinois Department of Public 
Health in its 143-year history, Dr. 
Ezike added that she was also ‘‘glad 
that I served as a role model to young 
girls, girls of color, little Black girls, 
that they can be leaders in any field.’’ 
In addition to shepherding our State 
through the worst COVID crisis, I am

grateful for her tremendous leadership 
in one other area too: preventing preg-
nancy-related death. This is a prevent-
able tragedy that affects women and 
babies of color especially hard. 
I have been working with ROBIN 
KELLY, the Congresswoman from the 
Chicagoland area, on this issue; and 
last April, Illinois received a waiver 
from Medicaid, allowing us to become 
the first State in the Nation to expand 
healthcare coverage for new moms on 
Medicaid from 60 days after pregnancy 
to a full year, a change I am certain 
that will save lives. 
In the American Rescue Plan, Con-
gress expanded that option to all 
States for 5 years. We continue to fight 
to make this change permanent for all 
new moms on Medicaid. I thank Dr. 
Ezike for helping to make the case for 
that change; for her service, courage, 
and leadership; and for her caring heart 
at a time when Illinois and America 
needed her so much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, 2 weeks ago, Russia initiated the 
largest land conflict in Europe since 
World War II. Millions of men, women, 
and children fled their homes to safety. 
Countless others have taken up arms in 
the name of freedom. 
President Putin’s unprovoked and 
brutal invasion of Ukraine did not hap-
pen overnight. The warning signs were 
very, very clear. The response from the 
Biden administration was anything 
but. The administration had false hope 
that strongly worded statements would 
be enough to deter an unprovoked war. 
President Biden waited until after 
Russia invaded Ukraine to level any 
sanctions at all. And even then, sanc-
tions came in waves, and they are still 
coming. 
President Biden was slow to hit 
Putin where it hurts. He refused to pe-
nalize the Russian energy sector until 
roughly a week—1 week—after the in-
vasion took place. The President re-
fused to act, and the world now sees 
the heart-wrenching results. 
President Biden has shown weakness 
on the world stage throughout his 40- 
plus years in politics—40 years. His for-
eign policy caves to adversaries, under-
mines our allies, and devalues the sac-
rifices of our men and women in uni-
form. 
In his first year of office, he aban-
doned 20 years of effort in Afghanistan 
and emboldened Putin to attack his 
neighbor. As I speak, the White House 
is reviving Iran’s hope of developing a 
nuclear weapon. 
Originally brokered when Joe Biden 
was Vice President in 2015, the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action, more 
commonly known as the JCPOA or the 
Iran deal, was a deeply flawed agree-
ment aimed at preventing Iran from 
acquiring nuclear weapons. In reality, 
it did the exact opposite. 
Nuclear security can’t be achieved 
with wishful thinking, watered-down 
sanctions, or by sending our adver-
saries planeloads of cash, which we did. 
Years later, we all know the result. 
The Iran deal did not work. 
President Biden wants to revive this 
disastrous deal, and this time it will be 
even worse. The Iranians don’t even 
want to negotiate with America and 
President Biden’s administration so we 
are allowing Russia to join at the nego-
tiating table negotiating for the United 
States. It doesn’t make any sense. 
Many Americans are likely asking 
why? The United States cannot trust 
the Russian Federation in any capac-
ity. If working with and propping up 
Russia isn’t bad enough, Iran is poised 
to receive billions of dollars from fro-
zen assets in this new agreement, in-
cluding funds from renewed oil exports. 
Rather than unleashing the power of 
the American energy industry and al-
lowing Americans to drill, drill, drill 
on our own soil, the Biden administra-
tion would rather do business with 
Venezuela and plead with Saudi Arabia 
to turn on the spigots. 
The administration is, again, leading 
from behind, held back by their pledge 
to their false climate gods. Yes, the cli-
mate has changed, and it has been 
changing for decades, but we can’t let 
the far-left extremist wing push us to 
buy oil from convicts and criminals 
just because they would rather ham-
string 
our 
economy 
than 
unleash 
American energy. 
The administration is letting Russia 
and Iran and China dictate the rules of 
the game, and they are letting an 
unelected bureaucrat who was not Sen-
ate confirmed, by the name of Rob 
Malley, conduct these talks through 
Russia. His now-former colleague re-
signed. Malley’s former colleague re-
signed in protest over Mr. Malley in 
conceding to Iran. 
The Russian negotiators are bragging 
about Iran’s huge wins in this would-be 
deal. I have a long list of concerns 
about how these negotiations are un-
folding, but at the top are the limited 
sanctions the administration appears 
to be open to in exchange for a short- 
term pause on the development of 
Tehran’s nuclear program. 
Let me be clear. These short-term 
sanctions are not the solution. They 
weren’t a few years ago, and they are 
not today. The administration must 
not allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear 
weapon. The Iran deal was a bad deal in 
2015, and it would be a worse deal 
today. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
immediately—immediately— 
walk away from the negotiating table 
before these discussions lead to yet an-
other Biden foreign policy disaster. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last week was an exceedingly produc-
tive week for the Senate. We funded 
the government, passed postal reform, 
kept our promise to the Ukrainian peo-
ple, revived VAWA, and unanimously 
passed anti-lynching legislation. Presi-
dent Biden is going to be busy this 
week signing a lot of bipartisan bills 
into law that will impact the lives of 
millions of Americans, and I thank my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
their good work. 
Today, we are picking up right where 
we left off—confirming more of the 
President’s nominees, maintaining our 
laser focus on lowering costs for Amer-
ican families, and continuing to ex-
plore how we can help Ukraine in their 
war against the evil Mr. Putin. 
First, on this last point, earlier 
today, the Speaker and I announced 
that President Zelenskyy will deliver a 
virtual address to Members of the 
House and Senate this Wednesday, 
March 16, at 9 a.m. As you know, it is 
one of the highest honors of any Con-
gress to welcome remarks by foreign 
heads of state, but it is nearly unheard 
of in modern times that we hear from 
a leader fighting for his life, fighting 
for his country’s survival, fighting to 
preserve the very idea of democracy. 
Let me say that again. It is one of 
the highest honors of any Congress to 
welcome remarks by a foreign head of 
state, but it is nearly unheard of—un-
heard of—in modern times that we hear 
from a leader fighting for his life, 
fighting for his country’s survival, and 
fighting to preserve the idea of democ-
racy—something Americans cherish. 
As war intensifies in Ukraine, we 
have all been inspired by the courage of 
President Zelenskyy and that of the 
Ukrainian people. President Zelenskyy 
can rest assured that he will always 
have friends in Congress ready to lis-
ten, to stand in his corner, and we are 
honored to have him speak to us later 
this week. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now on nomina-
tions, as we continue exploring ways to 
help the people of Ukraine, the Senate 
will also move forward on nominations. 
Later today, we are scheduled to vote 
to 
proceed 
on 
the 
nomination 
of 
Shalanda 
Young, 
President 
Biden’s 
choice to lead the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget. 
For the last year, Ms. Young has al-
ready been doing the work leading 
OMB as Acting Director, and she has 
proved to be bipartisan, deeply experi-
enced, and knows the budget and ap-
propriation process like the back of her 
hand. She was an amazing—amazing— 
budget director for the Appropriations 
Committee in the House and has been 
an amazing Acting Director, and she 
will do great as Director of OMB. 
It is time we make her appointment 
official here in the Senate, and I hope 
to see Members from both sides of the 
aisle rally behind her later this week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1139 
March 14, 2022 
If confirmed, Shalanda Young would 
make history as the very first Black 
woman confirmed by the Senate to lead 
the OMB—another glass ceiling shat-
tered by a remarkable Member of the 
President’s historic Cabinet. 
It has been under Ms. Young’s leader-
ship that the OMB has notched some of 
the administration’s biggest accom-
plishments, from securing billions in 
disaster relief funding and beefing up 
the Made in America Office to working 
with Congress on the bipartisan infra-
structure law. Clinton, LA, can cele-
brate this week knowing that one of 
their own is bringing the administra-
tion’s agenda to life. 
I look forward to seeing this great 
nominee confirmed later this week. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, now on costs and 
inflation, off the floor, Senate Demo-
crats will continue this week focusing 
on helping American families lower 
their cost of living and reap the full 
benefits of the historic job and wage 
growth under President Biden. 
Later this week, my colleagues on 
the Senate Finance Committee will 
hold an especially important hearing 
on the rising cost of prescription drugs 
and hear expert testimony on what we 
can do to make medications more af-
fordable. Lowering prescription drug 
prices should be absolutely one of the 
most bipartisan priorities in this Con-
gress. 
Few things ignite the same frustra-
tion as making trips to the pharmacy 
and seeing the price on your receipt go 
up and up and up for basic, often life-
saving, medications. Insulin is a par-
ticularly egregious example. According 
to some sources, a 40-day supply can 
now climb north of $600 a month. For 
millions of Americans who rely on in-
sulin to manage their diabetes, this is 
a five-alarm fire that demands Senate 
action. I expect we will consider next 
steps soon on some proposals already 
presented by my colleagues. 
Meanwhile, Senate Democrats will 
continue 
examining 
the 
disturbing 
trend of corporations reporting mas-
sive profits, even as Americans face 
higher costs. A headline from Yahoo 
News last month sums it up: 
Corporate America’s 2021 profits were high-
er than ever. 
Let me repeat that. 
Corporate America’s 2021 profits were high-
er than ever. 
It is deeply unfair and morally bank-
rupt for Americans to pay more for ba-
sics while many mega corporations are 
making a killing. Last week, I asked 
the head of the FTC to look into this 
trend in the area of energy prices, and 
corporations taking advantage of the 
American people should be on notice. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, on the Supreme 
Court, this week, Members from both 
sides of the aisle will continue meeting 
with President Biden’s nominee to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson. 
When President Biden nominated 
Judge Jackson, I promised that we 
would have a fair and expeditious proc-
ess, and that is exactly what we have 
had so far. Judge Jackson has now met 
with a broad range of Senators from 
both sides of the aisle, and she is ex-
pected to meet with all members of the 
Judiciary Committee before her hear-
ings begin next week. 
I am encouraged that, so far, the 
judge’s meetings with Senators have 
been very constructive. From conversa-
tions with my colleagues, everyone 
seems to agree on one thing: The judge 
is more than qualified for the big job 
on the High Court. Her record bears 
that out. As a district judge for 8 years, 
Judge Jackson rendered more than 550 
rulings and was rarely reversed by 
higher courts. 
Once Judge Jackson’s hearings begin 
next week, the American people will 
see for themselves precisely what Sen-
ators are seeing right now. 
Judge Jackson is brilliant, she is be-
loved, and she belongs on the Supreme 
Court. The three b’s I have given her: 
brilliant, beloved, belongs. 
I thank my colleagues for moving 
forward in a constructive way on this 
historic nomination. 
CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
Madam President, now on the omni, 
the omnibus budget, I want to revisit 
the groundbreaking omnibus package 
that the Senate passed last week with 
bipartisan support, which fully and 
robustly funds the government through 
the end of the 2022 fiscal year. 
As I said on Thursday, this year’s bi-
partisan budget bill is one of the bold-
est and most significant packages that 
we have seen passed through the Con-
gress in a long, long time. It is a deal 
just overflowing with good news for 
American families looking to cut costs 
and make ends meet. Let me highlight 
just a few ways this bill will lower 
costs in the coming months. 
For working Americans struggling 
with energy costs, this year’s budget 
increases domestic investments that 
help people pay their heating and air- 
conditioning bills. Utility costs have 
always fallen hardest on those least 
able to bear them, and I am glad this 
year we are increasing the help we pro-
vide working families to pay for their 
utilities. 
We are also boosting funding for 
child nutrition programs by 7 percent 
compared to 2021 so kids don’t go to 
school on an empty stomach or go 
through 
summer 
school 
uncertain 
about what or if they are going to eat. 
Working parents will also get a 
break. We are dramatically increasing 
the amount dedicated to childcare as-
sistance, making it easier for parents 
to reenter the workplace and earn a 
paycheck without having to worry 
about paying to take care of their kids. 
Head Start Programs will see more 
resources to help them prepare young 
kids to thrive in the classroom. Fund-
ing for title I–A grants, which help 
more than half our Nation’s public 
schools boost student performance, will 
receive the largest increase in a dec-
ade. 
College students, meanwhile, will see 
the largest increase in Pell grant maxi-
mums since the 2009–2010 academic 
year—a desperately needed injection of 
funding. 
These investments only scratch the 
surface. From housing assistance to 
help with energy costs, to aid for the 
elderly and our veterans and invest-
ments in child nutrition, this year’s 
funding package will drive down costs 
for parents, students, the elderly, and 
small business. Because both sides were 
able to work in good faith, American 
families will see more help come their 
way through the annual funding bill 
than they have seen in a long, long 
time.

TRIBUTE TO JANE LEE HAMMAN 
Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the distinct honor of rec-
ognizing Jane Lee Hamman of Jeffer-
son County as Montanan of the Month, 
for her patriotism, her dedication to 
serving her community, our great 
State, and our great Nation. 
Jane’s selfless contributions began at 
a young age when she started volun-
teering for Meals on Wheels with her 
parents. Jane also joined her parents in 
supporting Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., and the civil rights move-
ment as well, believing in equal oppor-
tunity and advancement for all people 
based on their character, not the color 
of their skin. In fact, her life mantra is 
‘‘Living to advance freedom, knowl-
edge, and justice for all.’’ I think I can 
speak for all who know her when I say 
that she truly embraces these ideals. 
Jane’s love for her country is on full 
display in the monthly column she 
writes for the Boulder Monitor news-
paper. The goal of Jane’s column is to 
preserve liberty, to educate readers 
about America’s vision of the Declara-
tion of Independence, and to celebrate 
our Constitution. 
She also shares her values of patriot-
ism and volunteerism with others 
while serving as the lay leader of the 
Clancy United Methodist Church and 
as the Oro Fino Chapter Registrar of 
the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion. 
Additionally, 
Jane 
has 
been 
ap-
pointed by Gov. Greg Gianforte to the 
Montana State Board of Education and 
is the chair for the North Jefferson 
County Public Library District Board 
of Trustees. 
I have no doubt that her love for the 
great State of Montana and the United 
States of America influences every per-
son she meets. 
It is truly my honor to recognize 
Jane for her commitment to serving 
her community, her State, and her 
country while spreading Montana’s val-
ues of service and patriotism. 
Jane, keep up the great work. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE). The Senator from Lou-
isiana. 
ENERGY 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have 
had many experiences presiding when 
you have gotten up to speak about en-
ergy and climate. So now the roles are 
reversed, and I will take a perspective 
somewhat similar to yours in the past 
but perhaps a little bit broader. 
We are in a point in time where it is 
clear that there is a nexus between en-
ergy, climate, economic security for a 
family and for a nation, and national 
security. And if we ignore any one, if 
we overemphasize one and forget the 
rest, then we lose all four. 
I will just share the example we have 
right now. The administration has 
clearly prioritized climate in such a 
way that they have attempted to de-
crease the amount of fossil fuel being 
produced in the United States of Amer-
ica and limit the exports of that fuel. 
Because of that singular emphasis, we 
are now at a point where we have en-
dangered the economy of many—not 
‘‘we’’ but circumstances around the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1143 
March 14, 2022 
world have endangered the economies 
of the European countries dependent 
upon Russian oil. It has endangered the 
pocketbook of the families that cannot 
afford $4- to $6-a-gallon gasoline, de-
pending upon where you live. And the 
climate globally is worse. 
Because 
there 
are 
inadequate 
amounts of liquefied natural gas going 
to Europe, they are going to burn tre-
mendous amounts of coal, and that 
coal, of course, will have a greenhouse 
gas profile that is far greater than that 
of natural gas. 
So the question is, How do we 
achieve all of our goals: the climate, 
the national security, the pocketbook 
issues for families and for our nation, 
as well as our energy security? So that 
is what I wish to speak about today. 
Now, of course, we know there is a 
tension here, and the tension here is 
between this kind of almost battle we 
have been having in our country: How 
do we develop America’s resources, but 
how do we do it while at the same time 
lowering carbon intensity? 
If one party is in charge of the regu-
latory state, then they will attempt to 
use regulatory power to choke off the 
amount of carbon coming from Amer-
ica’s resources. I am speaking of fossil 
fuel resources at this point. But, as I 
mentioned, it seems that with this 
backdrop of a need globally to be free 
of Russian energy, we need to have a 
different approach—acknowledging to-
tally those who are concerned about 
carbon intensity; acknowledging to-
tally the Europeans who are now so 
vulnerable to Russian energy short-
ages; acknowledging totally the family 
at home with the 10-year-old pickup 
truck who can’t afford to fill it up to 
get to work. 
Mr. President, let’s set the stage. Eu-
rope depends on Russia for 40 percent 
of its natural gas supplies. Some coun-
tries in Europe depend upon Russia for 
90 percent of their natural gas supplies. 
In 2013, the EU imported 135 billion 
cubic meters of Russian natural gas 
and in 2019, 166 billion cubic meters. 
One reason we need to export liquefied 
natural gas is to decrease that reliance 
upon Russian natural gas. 
By the way, one of the reasons that 
the EU is using more natural gas is 
that the carbon footprint of natural 
gas is so much less than that of coal. 
So using gas was a way to achieve that 
which the United States has achieved— 
an ability to decrease your carbon 
emissions by changing from coal to 
natural gas. 
Our goal here is to help the Euro-
peans continue not just that transition 
away from coal to lower their carbon 
intensity but also to help them de-
crease, lower their dependence upon 
Russia as regards overall their use of 
natural gas. 
There is a way to get at this within 
the next 10 months—to lower global 
greenhouse gas emissions, to help the 
Europeans be freer from Russian gas— 
in a way which actually does not in-
volve increased production here in the 
United States. When I speak of our 
goals here, it isn’t just to pump more 
out of the United States; it is to solve 
a global problem. 
An Italian energy executive with 
whom I spoke mentioned how in North 
Africa, they are using natural gas. 
They ship a certain amount of it to 
Italy, and then it goes to the rest of 
the continent. But the tanks coming 
from North Africa are about 50 percent 
full, and there is a liquefied natural gas 
terminal in Egypt which is way below 
capacity. Why? Because the population 
growth in North Africa has been so 
great and the number of people getting 
electricity has increased so dramati-
cally that the natural gas they used to 
ship to Europe is now being used do-
mestically. 
But the powerplants they are using 
to burn the natural gas are antiquated. 
They don’t burn efficiently. The emis-
sion profile of these natural gas power-
plants is much greater than that which 
is state of the art. So this gentleman in 
Italy had a great idea. He said: Why 
don’t we build out in the near term a 
$10 billion investment of solar panels in 
North Africa? 
It would seem like there is no better 
place in the world to do solar panels 
than the Sahara Desert. So if you did 
solar panels in Africa and you are ex-
changing the electrons from the solar 
panels for the electrons being burned in 
antiquated natural gas facilities, that 
gas would then be freed up to be 
shipped to Africa. It doesn’t increase— 
in fact, it decreases the net amount of 
natural gas being built, but it does it 
in a way that it delivers the gas where 
it is going to be burned in a more envi-
ronmentally friendly way. But it has 
economic development, and it has the 
substitution of solar for gas in North 
Africa. This is a win and a win and a 
win. 
What is the U.S. role here? Well, the 
U.S. role can take our DFC, which is 
our financing corporation for overseas 
development, and I am told that if we 
just put up 5 percent of the amount, 
that sends a message to other investors 
that this has the support of the U.S. 
Government and that they can step in 
here and make an investment too. 
Solar panels of that magnitude is a 
big project. On the other hand, it is 
something which can be done in the 
near term. In that near term, we are 
able to increase the supply of natural 
gas to Europe, while decreasing global 
greenhouse gas emissions. That is 
something we can do now. 
It does raise the question—someone 
said: Building that many solar panels, 
surely there would be some issues. It is 
my impression, at least, that there is 
far more open ground in the desert 
than there is in the cities but also that 
the regulatory burden in order to de-
ploy solar panels is a lot less in Africa, 
which kind of takes me to my next 
issue. 
We have the ability to increase our 
export of liquefied natural gas, to in-
crease the deployment of renewables 
here in the United States, to mine the 
uranium that would replace the Rus-
sian uranium we get for nuclear but 
also replace the Russian uranium the 
Europeans use. We have the ability to 
do that, but we are just locked up with 
regulations. I am not saying do away 
with the regulations; I am saying do 
something different in terms of how we 
regulate. 
We actually have a model for this. 
We saw at the beginning of the COVID 
pandemic that we had multiple Federal 
Agencies responsible for approving a 
new vaccine. They would kind of get to 
each other’s issue and request when 
they got to each other’s issue and re-
quest. So it could take 21⁄2 years to 
have a new vaccine approved by regula-
tion in order to even begin testing, 
much less to show that it worked and 
to begin to deploy. 
The previous administration, work-
ing with the different Agencies—I vis-
ualize it as bringing everybody in a 
room, and if somebody had a question, 
they would turn this question over to 
somebody else, and they had to sit 
there at that table until they resolved 
it, and then they gave it back, not 
‘‘Hey, listen, send it over here, and we 
will have it back to you in 4 weeks.’’ 
No. ‘‘Send it over here, and we will 
have it back to you in 3 days.’’ They 
compressed the time so that a vaccine, 
which, optimistically, we were hoping 
would be ready in 3 years, ended up 
being ready in less than 1. There is al-
ways a concern that if you compress 
that timeframe, you have to sacrifice 
safety, but there is no evidence that 
occurred with the coronavirus vaccine. 
In the same way, if we have multiple 
Agencies right now that are in charge 
of permitting some aspect of energy— 
whether it is renewable, whether it is 
mining, whether it is export—there can 
be an Operation Warp Speed for how 
they work together to bring our energy 
resources to bear and helping the Euro-
peans become free of Russian energy. 
It is not just lowering the price at 
the pump for us, because you can argue 
that is going to be very difficult to do 
in the near term. What it can be, 
though, is to keep the Europeans from 
going into a recession or a depression 
next winter because the demand for 
fuel is so great and they are unable to 
meet it. And if they don’t have some 
substitute for Russian energy and if 
the Russians decide to cut them off, 
they end up freezing, going energy 
poor, or having their industries crater 
because of a lack of energy. 
One more time, this is a nexus. We 
can do this in a way that is environ-
mentally friendly, producing the en-
ergy and exporting it in such a way 
that lowers global greenhouse gas 
emissions, because what is driving us 
right now is the economy of countries 
and the economy of families. 
If European families are energy poor, 
they will lose their political will to 
stand up to the Russians, and we will 
lose our ally. We have to support not 
just our families but theirs so that

they can get through this economi-
cally; so that, one, they can more af-
ford life; but, secondly, so that we can 
maintain political will as we stand up 
against the Russians. 
There are other aspects of this, as 
well. For those interested in battery 
technology, most of the critical min-
erals are coming from Russian or Chi-
nese sources. If we are concerned about 
climate and we are concerned about 
the ability to be critical mineral inde-
pendent in case of geopolitical tension, 
this is the exact same issue that we 
have been speaking about. 
How do we proceed? One, we just 
have to recognize that we are at a time 
of extreme geopolitical tension where 
decisions we make in this country have 
ramifications worldwide. The Euro-
peans are looking to us to help them 
with their energy crisis, and if we fail 
to help the Europeans with their en-
ergy crisis, the Europeans will pay as 
much as 6,000 euros more a year per 
family for their energy, and they will 
probably go into a deep recession. 
On the other hand, if we are able to 
solve this for the Europeans, we will 
also solve it for our families, the ones 
who are paying $4 to $6 for a gallon of 
gasoline. 
We know what we are speaking 
about. Just to show that this can be 
done, as the United States has sub-
stituted natural gas for coal, we have 
lowered our domestic emissions by 14 
percent at a time when global emis-
sions have risen 4 percent. In that 
time, since 2005, where we lowered our 
emissions by 14 percent, our economy 
is larger. We have millions more people 
and we are domestically producing 
much more oil and gas, and there has 
been a subsequent return of energy-re-
lated industry to the United States. 
So despite an industrial profile and a 
mining profile and a population profile 
that would suggest that there would be 
greater emissions, we actually have 14 
percent less than 2005. We did it by ac-
knowledging that domestic production 
of energy was going to help with our 
economy, help with the economy of 
families, but also help our domestic se-
curity, and would also help climate and 
the carbon intensity of our society. 
We have done this for our country. 
Now the question is, Can we do it for 
the world? I would argue that if we 
choose not to, the Russians will win. 
There is no way that Europe or Euro-
peans are going to accept energy pov-
erty with a crater economy due to the 
lack of affordable energy. 
On the other hand, if we are able to 
make this commitment doing things 
such as financing for solar panels in 
North Africa, an Operation Warp Speed 
for energy to bring our energy re-
sources to bear, the continued substi-
tution of lower carbon intensity energy 
sources for that which currently is 
higher carbon intensity, then, we can 
accomplish worldwide that which we 
have accomplished here in the United 
States, which is to lower greenhouse 
gas emissions while making a more 
prosperous society and increasing do-
mestic and international security. 
This is not theoretical. I have spoken 
with someone who could have an off-
shore LNG export facility completed in 
12 months, if he had his permits from 
the Federal Government. I spoke to 
someone involved with drilling in the 
Outer Continental Shelf and learned 
that their company could be sending 
oil to the refineries in Louisiana with-
in 12 months if they could get their 
permits done expeditiously. And I can 
give list after list of renewable, of fos-
sil, and otherwise. 
It is now the time for the United 
States to take leadership. If we don’t, 
our families will continue to suffer at 
the pump, Europeans will enter a reces-
sion, and, most unfortunately, the 
cause of freedom worldwide will be 
harmed by Russia’s continued eco-
nomic hegemony over the rest of the 
world because of their energy.

NOMINATION OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Shalanda Young’s nomina-
tion to be the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
Ms. Young has served with distinc-
tion as OMB’s Acting Director for the 
past year, leading the administration’s 
efforts to execute the American Rescue 
Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, 
and numerous Federal cybersecurity 
priorities. 
Over the past year, she has been a 
true partner to Congress, working 
closely with Members on both sides of 
the aisle to find bipartisan paths for-
ward. 
In addition to her proven leadership 
at OMB this past year, Ms. Young 
brings nearly two decades of public 
service experience to her role, includ-
ing as a senior staff Member on the 
House 
Appropriations 
Committee 
where she led challenging bipartisan 
negotiations around the debt limit, 
government funding, and budget re-
form. 
OMB will continue to be central to 
the administration’s efforts to tackle 
the Nation’s ongoing challenges, and 
Ms. Young will be instrumental in 
leading that work. 
I have every confidence in Ms. 
Young’s ability to continue to rise to 
the challenges facing OMB, both now 
and in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Shalanda Young as director of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). On this vote, the yeas are 
53, the nays are 31. 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
REMEMBERING MARK RAPP 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, at 5:30 
p.m. on September 11, 2001, members of 
Indiana Task Force One left Indianap-
olis to head to New York City. Task 
Force One is our State’s search and 
rescue squad, made up of our bravest 
and most selfless first responders who 
deploy around the country in times of 
emergency. 
In the caravan to Ground Zero that 
day was Mark Rapp. Mark was a found-
ing member of Task Force One. He was 
a hero’s hero, a rescuer’s rescuer. On 
March 4, 2022, Chief Mark Rapp died 
after a courageous battle with lung 
cancer. 
Mark, who was known by the nick-
name ‘‘Bum’’—that is right, ‘‘Bum 
Rapp’’—served the city of Indianapolis 
as a firefighter for 37 years. He retired 
as a battalion chief of training in 2017. 
In 1993, Mark received the Medal of 
Bravery for the risky rescue of a small 
child from a dangerous apartment fire. 
He is also a recipient of the American 
Red Cross Heroism Award, the Oper-
ations Firefighter of the Year Award, 
and the Peer Leadership Award for his 
work as a role model for the force. 
For 10 years, he led the Indianapolis 
Fire Department’s Clothe-A-Child Pro-
gram, wherein young people in need 
shop for clothing alongside a fire-
fighter; and Mark was a deeply in-
volved father. He built a log cabin in 
the Outdoor Lab at Indian Creek Ele-
mentary School. For over 20 years, he 
worked on the ‘‘chain gang’’ at Law-
rence 
North 
High 
School 
football 
games. His sons, Mark, Jr., and Greg, 
eventually worked alongside him as 
firefighters. 
As a member of Task Force One, 
Mark was deployed to assist in the 
aftermath of several natural disasters, 
including Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 
2008. He was also a certified rescue 
diver. 
In September 2001, Mark spent 10 
days at Ground Zero, leading Indiana 
Task Force One through the night shift 
during nonstop search and rescue ef-
forts. It is believed that the lung can-
cer that ultimately claimed Mark’s life 
could be traced to the toxins he inhaled 
in 2001. Nearly half of the 65 Task 
Force One members who were deployed 
to the World Trade Center in 2001 have 
reported 
illnesses 
related 
to 
their 
work. Mark was the fifth to have died 
from those illnesses. 
On behalf of the people of Indianap-
olis, the Hoosiers, and the American 
people, we thank Mark Rapp, Sr., for 
his courage, bravery, and leadership; 
and our prayers are with Nancy, his 
wife, his three children, and all of 
those who love him. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, the 
American people—the world—is watch-
ing a really horrendous, barbaric, hor-
rible situation in Ukraine; and we are 
all praying for the people there, trying 
to do as much as we can to support 
them. And this barbarism we are seeing 
from Vladimir Putin is something I 
don’t think anyone is ever going to for-
get. 
We can’t let it stand. We need to use 
all instruments of American power— 
with our allies—to work to address this 
long term because this is a long-term 
problem—the new era of authoritarian 
aggression led by Putin, led by Xi 
Jinping—and we need to be able to ad-
dress it. 
One of these instruments of Amer-
ican power that we have had until re-
cently, in a bipartisan way—every 
President has supported being an en-
ergy producer, being an energy super-
power, being a country that is energy 
independent. 
And I don’t have to tell the Presiding 
Officer, but this has been highlighted 
by the current crisis. What has hap-
pened is the American people—really, 
the world—have awoken to the fact 
that the Biden administration came 
into office and, instead of building on 
what they inherited from the Trump 
administration, which, again, was a bi-
partisan goal of American foreign pol-
icy, American energy policy, American 
domestic policy—for decades, every 
President—every 
President—wanted 
America to be energy independent. 
President Obama used to talk about 
this, all-of-the-above energy: oil, gas, 
renewables; Jimmy Carter, of course; 
Donald Trump; George W. Bush. I 
mean, it dates back for decades, until 
the Biden administration. 
And, of course, they came in and on 
day one said: We are going to start 
shutting down the production of Amer-
ican energy. That is a fact. I am going 
to go through a lot of the facts. I am 
going to go through some detailed 
memos that are still in existence that 
show that this is exactly their policy. 
Now, what has happened in the last 2 
weeks? The American people have 
started to realize: Oh, my gosh, my 
own government is trying to make it 
harder for us to produce American en-
ergy. How does that make sense? In 
what world does that make sense? 
And the average American—always 
very smart, by the way, much smarter 
than the people in DC—is raising the 
alarm bells, saying: Wait a minute. 
Why would we do that? It hurts us at 
home. It drives up energy prices. 
The President is calling it Putin’s en-
ergy increases. That is ridiculous. En-
ergy prices have been going up since 
this administration got into office be-
cause of this administration’s policies. 
Good try, Mr. President. That is not 
going to work. 
So the American people are saying: It 
is hurting us at home. It is raising 
costs on my family. 
But they are now realizing: Whoa, 
this is really bad for our foreign policy 
and national security too, when you 
have a war like what is going on in 
Ukraine. 
So all of a sudden, you see the Biden 
administration—from the President on 
down and his whole team—starting to 
scramble. They are starting to hide 
their policy that has been driven by a 
far-left radical agenda and is really 
hurtful to everybody. By the way, it 
doesn’t help the environment one bit, 
not one bit. I will come down here in 
another speech and talk about how it 
hurts the environment. 
And it is almost funny to watch this 
happen if this weren’t such a serious 
topic. It is almost funny. As a matter 
of fact, to one Cabinet official, it was 
funny. 
Go 
Google 
the 
Secretary 
Granholm interview—I forget which 
news station—when she was asked, 
‘‘Hey, are you going to help produce 
more oil for America?’’ She literally 
starts cracking up, laughing. She is 
laughing. 
It is not funny, Madam Secretary. So 
now, the White House is scrambling 
with made-up stories, made-up ration-
ales. You see the Press Secretary kind 
of trying to talk about this issue. No 
offense to her. She is pretty talented, 
but she doesn’t know anything about 
energy. 
But they are scrambling because no 
one is laughing. No one is laughing. 
The Secretary of Energy might be 
laughing about this topic, but no one is 
laughing. Working families in America 
aren’t laughing. The energy workers 
that this administration has moved to 
hand pink slips to aren’t laughing. Our 
allies 
in 
Europe 
aren’t 
laughing. 
Ukrainians aren’t laughing. 
The only ones who might be laughing 
are the Venezuelans and the Iranians 
who this administration is now going 
and begging for oil from. They might 
be laughing. 
So it is a really serious topic. And, as 
I mentioned, the energy price rise that 
we have seen across the last year—gas 
prices were almost up 50 percent prior 
to the invasion of Ukraine by Putin. So 
we know what is going on because it is 
no secret. 
When 
the 
President 
was 
cam-
paigning—again, I don’t think these

March 14, 2022 
were really his views but driven by the 
far-left that he had to get their vote 
on—he vowed that he would do exactly 
what he did on day one. Here is the 
President in a debate in 2019: I have ar-
gued against any more drilling. No 
more drilling—oil or gas drilling on 
Federal lands. I will not allow it any-
more. 
That is the President of the United 
States. 
Now, on day one, he did just that. He 
did just that. He started out to keep 
these campaign promises. We know he 
canceled the Keystone Pipeline. They 
put a ‘‘pause’’—I am going to talk 
about that—on Federal leasing and per-
mitting, something that really im-
pacted my State. He signed an Execu-
tive order to crack down on oil and gas 
production. He canceled the legally ac-
quired leases that my State has in the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be-
cause this body voted for it, signed it 
into law. The President, in a blatantly 
illegal move, said: I am not going to 
allow these leases, even though the 
Congress of the United States and the 
President of the United States pre-
viously passed a law saying they had to 
be executed. 
And just 2 weeks ago, the administra-
tion froze new drilling permits and 
stopped issuing new leases on Federal 
lands because they continue to be driv-
en by a far-left agenda that nobody in 
the United States is supporting right 
now. 
(Ms. SMITH assumed the Chair.) 
Well, Madam President, I want to dig 
a little deeper into what happened on 
day one. 
So what happened here—I have an 
order. This is an order—order No. 3395 
from the Acting Secretary of the Inte-
rior, a guy by the name of Scott de la 
Vega. I have never heard of him. Never 
heard of him. Who in the heck is that? 
It was dated January 20, 2021, so that 
is day one. That is day one. Some guy 
named Scott de la Vega—I don’t know 
who he is, but I guess he was Acting 
Secretary of the Interior—and he lays 
out in this memo everything that 
should be suspended, everything in 
America, to stop producing any natural 
resources for 60 days. OK? 
That is your government at work, 
America, right here: Scott de la Vega 
hereby temporarily suspends—and then 
they have a whole list of things that 
deal with oil, gas, minerals, rights of 
way—anything on Federal lands—all 
stopped. If that is not a far-left radical 
agenda, I don’t know what is. 
It says that people above him—the 
Secretary, Deputy Secretary—they can 
rescind that after 60 days. But there is 
no one above him. This is day one. 
There is nobody even confirmed. That 
is why Scott de la Vega was Acting 
Secretary of the Interior. Don’t be 
fooled. This is an order on day one 
from the Biden administration to shut 
down the production of American en-
ergy. Your government at work, Amer-
ica. 
What happened across the country? I 
can tell you what happened in my 
State. This set up a mad scramble in 
Alaska. I was getting phone calls, lit-
erally, from this memo. I didn’t know 
anything about it. 
Why? 
What was happening here? 
In my State, because we have the 
highest environmental standards in the 
world on oil and gas development, on 
mineral development, we do our explo-
ration only in the winter—only in the 
winter. About a 3-month period—Janu-
ary, February, March, April—4 months, 
because we create ice roads and ice 
paths. These are giant roads of ice and 
giant paths of ice that can take out 
giant drill rigs on the tundra. We do 
our exploration then, and then we 
bring it off in 4 months. The ice roads 
melt, and there is zero impact. It is 
called zero impact exploration. OK? It 
is expensive, but we do that in Alaska 
because we really care about our envi-
ronment. We know how to do both: pro-
tect our environment and develop our 
resources. We only have about 3 to 4 
months to even do this work every win-
ter. 
So I had a bunch of Alaskans—hun-
dreds, thousands—out doing the work 
of America—oil and gas development. 
Old Mr. de la Vega comes out day one 
of the Biden administration and says, 
We are going to suspend any lease or 
permit. 
When you are in the oil and gas in-
dustry, you are constantly having to 
get additional permits—what they call 
ATDs, applications to drill—to build an 
ice road, to do other things that are 
way beyond leases—Jen Psaki—way be-
yond leases. You have to get these per-
mits reviewed and updated very fre-
quently. 
They said: No issuing of anything. 
I get a call—I will give you one exam-
ple—from a company that almost 300 
people do an exploration for. They were 
just told: You are not going to get any-
thing else for 60 days. They couldn’t do 
anything. They are going to fire all 300 
people. 
We scrambled. We made phone calls. 
We tried to get this order lifted—tried 
to get an exception. This was hap-
pening all across America. The Federal 
Government came in—the Biden ad-
ministration. That was day one, and 
Mr. de la Vega—again, don’t know who 
he is—issued this order: 60 days and 
stopped everything. 
Joe Biden is out there saying: Oh, no, 
we really care about energy produc-
tion. 
No, you don’t. You are trying to kill 
it. That was the mad scramble. Many 
people were laid off. This is way beyond 
Keystone—10,000 laid off. 
Let me go into a little more detail. 
After 60 days, what happened? This is 
really important. I really want our 
friends in the media to dig into this. 
Again, you have these things called ap-
plications to drill on Federal leases. 
OK? All of that was stalled for 60 days. 
You couldn’t do a thing. This is just a 
year ago, right—just a year ago from 
this administration that is now telling 
the American people: Oh, no, we are 
fully for energy development. 
They were trying to kill it. 
OK. Normally, when you have a lease 
on a Federal land, you have Federal 
managers. I will give you the example 
in Alaska. In the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, they will have a field man-
ager, right? So let’s say there is a field 
manager for BLM in Fairbanks, AL. 
That man or woman has a fair amount 
of authority. They can issue these ap-
plications to drill, to move forward. 
This is a government that is not cen-
tralized, right? You want the decision- 
makers—who, by the way, are almost 
all professional career staff—to make 
science-based decisions—not political 
decisions—on 
these 
applications 
to 
drill. That is the way it works. That is 
the way it has always worked. 
So you have a field manager, say, in 
Fairbanks. You will have a district 
level manager in the interior part of 
Alaska. Then you will have one State 
director, the BLM State director, OK? 
So they usually—not even the State di-
rector. The lower-level Federal offi-
cials can issue these permits to keep 
the country moving, producing oil, gas. 
What happened after 60 days? After 60 
days in 2021—so you have the Biden ad-
ministration—Mr. de la Vega shutting 
down all energy production for 60 days 
in America. That is this order. So after 
60 days, what happened? Well, there 
was another order issued. This was 
issued by a woman, an official named 
Laura Daniel-Davis. She is the Acting 
Assistant Secretary for the Office of 
Land and Mineral Management. OK. 
Sounds kind of important. Actually, it 
is really important. That is the Assist-
ant Secretary of the Interior in charge 
of all oil and gas and mineral develop-
ment for America. It is a pretty impor-
tant job. 
In the Trump administration, we had 
a really great Alaskan, Joe Balash. He 
had that job. Did a great job, by the 
way. So after 60 days, Acting Assistant 
Secretary for the Land and Mineral 
Management—oil and gas, mining—she 
issues a memo. I have it right here. I 
will quote from some of it. She issues a 
memo. What her memo says was: Hey, 
you have that Executive order—60-day 
delay by Mr. de la Vega. OK, that is 
running out in 2 days. This is March 19, 
2021. It is not even a year old. 
What she says in her order is that: 
You know how you guys in the Federal 
agencies—a field manager, the district 
level manager, the State director, all 
across America—I am giving you one 
example in Alaska. You know how you 
all have authority to issue permits to 
drill, things like that? That is the way 
it has been going on for decades and 
decades. Well, I, Acting Assistant Sec-
retary Laura Daniel-Davis, I am taking 
that away from you. I am taking that 
away. 
Her memo says every decision—she 
lists a bunch—a bunch—OK? Every de-
cision—now, remember, nobody was 
able to do anything for 60 days. Now, 
we are saying the 60-day delay is over,

March 14, 2022 
but any decision you lower-level peo-
ple—BLM and others—had to make on 
applications to drill and permits like 
that—hundreds and hundreds across 
the country—she says—I am going to 
quote from her: 
For those matters that have been sub-
mitted in accordance with S.O. 3395— 
She is referencing the Executive 
order that says stop everything. She 
now says: If you haven’t received any 
kind of approval for that stuff—‘‘If you 
have not received the final ASLM’’— 
that is her decision—‘‘you may not 
proceed [on any of these permits] with-
out approval from ASLM,’’ meaning 
her. 
Think about that. This is an adminis-
tration saying they really care about 
moving oil and gas on Federal lands 
forward. In the first 60 days, they say 
everything stopped. Then they say: All 
right. You are going to move forward 
the way it used to work—field man-
agers, district level managers, State 
directors, in every State in America— 
no, no, no, you don’t have that author-
ity. Me, Assistant Secretary Acting— 
by the way, she is still not confirmed 
by the Senate—every one of those has 
to come to me for my approval—every 
one. Every one in Alaska, every one in 
New Mexico, every one in North Da-
kota—anywhere—by the way, all on 
the offshore, Gulf of Mexico—anywhere 
that at the lower levels in the Federal 
Government you had professional staff 
who had the authority to grant these 
applications to drill and other Federal 
permits, this memo says: No. That will 
be centralized under me—for America— 
for America—every darn decision for 
oil and gas production and mineral pro-
duction in the country has to be ap-
proved by this Acting Assistant Sec-
retary. 
Guess what? This memo is still in op-
eration right now—right now. When 
the President of the United States 
looks at the American people and Jen 
Psaki: Oh, we are doing everything. 
No, you are not. You have one person 
and this order. I am not going to go 
into her background much, but let’s 
just face it. If you look at it, she spent 
her whole career trying to take out the 
oil and gas industry. Now, she is in 
charge of every decision for every per-
mit on every Federal lease for the pro-
duction of American energy in the 
country, and she is still in charge. You 
have one person. 
By the way, this is a political ap-
pointee. I don’t think she is going to 
get confirmed because I am going to 
block her; that is for sure. But even 
some of my Democratic colleagues are 
like, this is going on right now, OK? 
My friends in the media, I hope you 
take a look at this. 
What is really interesting here is you 
have someone who is a political ap-
pointee—a career trying to take out 
the oil and gas industry—and none of 
this is based on science. This is all po-
litical. They are removing the career 
staff, the scientists, saying: Hey, it has 
to be up to me. One political appointee 
is in charge of issuing all permits in 
the United States in the energy sector. 
It is still going on. 
This would be like if you wanted to 
get a loan—right—and you went to 
your local bank in your hometown. 
Let’s say it was Bank of America. 
There was a local bank, Bank of Amer-
ica in your hometown. This would be 
like having to go to headquarters on 
Wall Street to get approval for your 
loan. Think about it. That is going on 
right now. 
And the President has the audacity 
to look the American people in the eye 
saying: Oh, we are trying to do all we 
can. 
No, you are not. Why don’t you re-
scind this order? This is part of the 
Biden administration’s obsession from 
day one with stopping the production 
of American energy and politicizing it 
with a political appointee—who, by the 
way, doesn’t know much about the in-
dustry either. 
But there is more to this memo. It 
gets quite interesting because there is 
this kind of doublespeak in it. I am 
going to read from a little bit of it. She 
says that for matters that have been 
submitted in accordance with the shut-
down—60-day shutdown—but for which 
you have not received approval from 
me, you are still not allowed to move 
forward. You have to come through me, 
the one political appointee who doesn’t 
like the energy sector. 
But here is the interesting thing. She 
says: ‘‘Please [also] provide early noti-
fication.’’ So flag it if it is an item 
coming up to me that is part of the ad-
ministration’s priorities. I am quoting 
right now: ‘‘For example, renewable en-
ergy projects [those will go to the front 
of the line] or other climate related 
milestones, ‘30 by 30’ initiatives’’—that 
is shutting down 30 percent of all Fed-
eral lands. 
That is not a law by the way; just an-
other radical thing they are doing—‘‘or 
actions related to racial equity, envi-
ronmental justice.’’ 
OK. This is in her memo. She is say-
ing: Hey, I get to approve everything— 
all applications, drill, any permits on 
any Federal land, anything—one per-
son. But if it is part of a far-left radical 
agenda, by the way, that has nothing 
to do with energy production, give me 
a heads-up. 
Then she says: 
As well as early notification on items that 
are of high local, state, or regional interest. 
What does that mean, ‘‘early notifi-
cation’’? Make sure she knows items 
that are of ‘‘high local, state, or re-
gional interest.’’ What does that mean? 
I don’t know. It is kind of code for 
something. 
Let me give you one example of what 
I think it is code for. Remember, she is 
in charge of issuing all these permits, 
and there have been a flood of oil and 
gas production permits. Guess which 
State in America in the first year of 
the Biden administration has had close 
to half of all oil and gas drilling per-
mits issued by the Department of Inte-
rior approved? Remember, she is ap-
proving them all. She doesn’t really 
like oil and gas, but if she has to ap-
prove some, it might be related to 
items that are of ‘‘high local, state, or 
regional interest.’’ I wonder who that 
is. 
Who is it? Is it Alaska? No, I don’t 
think so. Trust me. They are delaying 
us as much as they can. They don’t 
like us. Twenty-two Executive orders 
and Executive actions solely focused on 
Alaska by this administration, they 
really don’t like us. 
Is it Texas, North Dakota? The State 
that has got close to half of all oil and 
gas drilling permits that this Acting 
Assistant Secretary, who is in charge 
of granting—because, remember, she 
centralized everything—is New Mexico. 
New Mexico. Whoa. New Mexico? New 
Mexico. 
Do you think New Mexico would be a 
high State or regional interest if you 
are her and your boss is from New Mex-
ico? Probably. How about if you have a 
Senator from New Mexico calling all 
the time? Probably. 
All right. So I really wish the media 
would look into this, right? Because 
right now you have the President of 
the United States, Jen Psaki, and oth-
ers, saying: Oh, we are trying to do ev-
erything we can here. You have got 
this memo that is still in effect by an 
Acting Assistant Secretary, saying: I 
am going to control every permit 
issued in America on Federal lands. It 
is right here. Read it. And you can’t 
move, you regional directors in BLM, 
you know, in Fairbanks, AK, you State 
directors—no, no, no. I am in charge, 
and I am going to approve them. You 
can’t move without me. But give me a 
heads-up. If it is regional interest, Deb 
Haaland might care about the New 
Mexico ones or climate change or ra-
cial equity or whatever else she listed. 
So if this administration really want-
ed to do all it could to produce en-
ergy—which is what every American 
knows we need to do and what our al-
lies know we need to do and what 
Putin hopes we don’t do—I think one 
thing they could do is to get Acting As-
sistant Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis’s 
boot off the neck of the American en-
ergy sector because, right now, she is 
in charge. 
Every permit on Federal lands listed 
in her memo of March 21—I am sorry, 
March 19, 2021, she is in charge of: final 
resource management plans, records of 
decisions, coal leasing, mining oper-
ations, 
R.S. 
2477, 
land 
sales, 
ex-
changes—what else do we have here— 
applications for permits to drill, oil 
and gas leases, applications for royalty 
relief. She is in charge of all of that 
right now. 
In this administration, the President, 
Jen Psaki, and others have the audac-
ity to look the American people in the 
eye and say: We are trying to do every-
thing we can in our power to produce 
more. If you were, you would rescind 
this memo—rescind this memo.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1148 
March 14, 2022 
So the next time the President or 
some of his staff or Secretary of En-
ergy or Secretary of Interior try to 
spin the American people and tell them 
they are trying to help, I hope my 
friends in the media go, well, what 
about this memo? Come on, that is like 
basic Federal Government 101. If you 
are telling everybody, stop, halt, and 
everything in the country has to be ap-
proved by her, that is not the way it 
works normally. But because of their 
anti-energy agenda, she is making the 
calls—but make sure that you give her 
a heads-up, if it is related to some of 
the far-left agenda that she literally 
lays out in the memo. 
I hope my friends in the media ask 
some questions. I hope they ask the 
question: Is it related to this memo 
that New Mexico is getting all the 
drilling permits? It would be a good 
question to ask, I think. Don’t you 
think? I think so. Alaska’s not getting 
a lot, but New Mexico is. I wonder why. 
Maybe that is related to making sure 
she gets, ‘‘early notification of items 
that are of high local, State or regional 
interest.’’ 
This is not a laughing matter. There 
is so much that we have to focus on in 
the world today, in America today, and 
one of the things this administration 
needs to do is they need a major course 
correction on their energy policy. 
You can’t let energy be dictated by 
the far left of the Democratic Party. 
You can’t let national security of 
America be dictated by the ‘‘woke’’ ele-
ments of the Democratic Party. And if 
you really are serious, Mr. President of 
the United States, you need to call Deb 
Haaland and say: Rescind that memo. 
Let the officials, the professional staff 
of the Federal Agencies, which the 
President has charged to do their job 
that they have done with every other 
administration—rescind this memo and 
start helping our country produce 
American energy again. 
I yield the floor.

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT 
FOR 
THE 
INTELLIGENCE 
AU-
THORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL 
YEAR 2022 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this 
explanation reflects the status of nego-
tiations 
and 
disposition 
of 
issues 
reached between the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence and the 
House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence for the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
The explanation shall have the same 
effect with respect to the implementa-
tion of this act as if it were a joint ex-
planatory statement of a conference 
committee. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Joint Explanatory Statement for the 
Intelligence Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2022 be printed into the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JOINT
EXPLANATORY
STATEMENT—INTEL-
LIGENCE
AUTHORIZATION
ACT
FOR
FISCAL 
YEAR 2022 
The following is the Joint Explanatory 
Statement (the ‘‘Explanatory Statement’’) 
to the Intelligence Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2022 (‘‘the Act’’), which has been 
included as Division X of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2022. The Explanatory 
Statement reflects the result of negotiations 
and disposition of issues reached between the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
(‘‘SSCI’’) and the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence (‘‘HPSCI’’) (to-
gether, the ‘‘Committees’’). The Explanatory 
Statement shall have the same effect with 
respect to the implementation of the Act as 
if it were a joint explanatory statement of a 
conference committee. 
The 
Explanatory 
Statement 
comprises 
three parts: an overview of the application of 
the annex to accompany this statement; a 
statement on anomalous health incidents; 
and unclassified congressional direction. 
PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX 
AND SCHEDULE OF AUTHORIZATIONS 
The classified nature of U.S. intelligence 
activities prevents the Committees from 
publicly disclosing many details concerning 
their final decisions regarding funding levels 
and policy direction. Therefore, in addition 
to the Schedule of Authorizations, a classi-
fied annex to the Act—referred to here and 
within the annex itself as the ‘‘Agree-
ment’’—has been prepared to describe in de-
tail the scope and intent of the Committees’ 
actions. 
The Agreement supersedes the classified 
annexes that accompanied H.R. 5412 and S. 
2610; and reconciles differences between the 
Committees, with respect to the National In-
telligence Program (NIP). The Agreement 
also makes recommendations for the Mili-
tary Intelligence Program (MIP) and the In-
formation 
Systems 
Security 
Program 
(ISSP). The Agreement authorizes the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) to obligate and ex-
pend funds not altered or modified by the 
classified Schedule of Authorizations as re-
quested in the President’s budget, subject to 
modification under applicable reprogram-
ming procedures. 
The classified Schedule of Authorizations 
is incorporated into the bill pursuant to Sec-
tion 102. It has the status of law. The Agree-
ment supplements and adds detail to clarify 
the authorization levels found in the bill and 
the classified Schedule of Authorizations. 
The Committees view direction and rec-
ommendations, whether contained in the Ex-
planatory Statement or in the Agreement, as 
requiring 
compliance 
by 
the 
Executive 
Branch. 
PART II: STATEMENT REGARDING ANOMALOUS 
HEALTH INCIDENT 
From the time the Committees received 
the first ‘‘Havana Syndrome’’ reports, the 
Committees have focused intently on the 
anomalous health incidents (‘‘AHIs’’) that 
have afflicted United States Government 
personnel, including many in the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) and other United 
States Government personnel. Provisions of 
the Act reflect that continuing, bicameral 
and bipartisan effort. 
The Biden Administration also has pursued 
its own initiatives. As directed by Congress, 
it earlier this year appointed a senior offi-
cial, within the National Security Council, 
to oversee the government’s response to 
AHIs. Additionally, in recent months, a 
widely-discussed assessment concluded that 
a majority of reported AHIs can be explained 
by medical conditions or environmental or 
technical factors, and that it is unlikely that 
a foreign actor—including Russia—is en-
gaged in a sustained, global campaign in-
volving hundreds of incidents without detec-
tion. But the assessment left other cases un-
explained, including a small subset that the 
IC continues to scrutinize most closely. 
Around the same time, an IC panel of ex-
perts determined that certain AHIs cannot 
be explained by environmental or medical 
conditions, but could be due to external 
stimuli. While acknowledging important in-
formation gaps, the panel further determined 
that pulsed electromagnetic energy—and, in 
some cases, ultrasound—plausibly might ex-
plain AHIs’ core characteristics; and that 
psychosocial factors alone could not account 
for those characteristics, though they might 
cause some other incidents or contribute to 
long-term symptoms. 
These findings advance the United States’ 
understanding of AHIs. But these findings 
are also heavily qualified, tentative, and 
based on a developing and incomplete body 
of evidence and scientific and medical 
knowledge. Most important, as the Commit-
tees wish to stress, these recent develop-
ments do not justify shifting the Executive 
Branch’s AHI-related activities into a lower 
gear, or discrediting the reports of AHI vic-
tims. 
The core work on AHIs—to include exam-
ination of a potential role by one or more 
foreign actors—must continue apace. As 
with prior inquiries into complex and murky 
intelligence problems, unraveling the AHI 
mystery fully may take time. It might be 
years before the United States reaches defin-
itive conclusions about exactly who, or 
what, is behind AHIs. 
The Administration has acknowledged that 
a great deal remains to be done. Indeed, 
much more evidence will have to be gath-
ered. Plausible theories regarding responsi-
bility for AHIs will have to be weighed 
against a record that will grow and change 
over time, and potentially may have to be 
revisited if circumstances warrant. And no 
plausible theory should be ruled out or 
downplayed prematurely. 
Success will depend on many factors. 
Among other things, it will be important to 
have a well-resourced cadre of ‘‘cross- 
cleared’’ individuals, at all relevant IC ele-
ments and other Executive Branch organiza-
tions, who can readily review and analyze all 
relevant intelligence and information, and 
without hindrances. The Committees long 
have emphasized this, with respect to AHi 
and many other priority intelligence mat-
ters. However, the Executive Branch has yet 
to take all necessary steps, to do away with 
excessive compartmentation and unneces-
sary bureaucracy; and to ensure that, for 
AHi and for other vital missions, the right 
people consistently and easily can access 
necessary information. That will have to 
change. 
Treatment also must remain a matter of 
highest priority. All AHi victims must be en-
couraged to file prompt reports of their expe-
riences, and without fear of being disbelieved 
or dismissed. They and their families must 
receive the highest quality medical and

other care and must receive that care imme-
diately. Thus far, some bureaucratic road-
blocks to the provision of care have been re-
moved—but there is no excuse for any to re-
main. They must be dismantled. And new 
ones must not be erected. 
Above all, there can be no slowing down, in 
the investigation into AHIs and in the treat-
ment of AHI victims and their families. To 
do so would risk signaling—to those individ-
uals, to the broader IC workforce, and to the 
wider world—that, though it prioritized the 
issue most highly for a discrete time, the 
United States is ‘‘moving on’’ from AHIs. 
That cannot be allowed to happen. And the 
Committees will continue to conduct vig-
orous oversight, to prevent it from hap-
pening. 
PART III: UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL 
DIRECTION 
This Joint Explanatory Statement incor-
porates by reference, and the Executive 
Branch shall comply with, all direction con-
tained in the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence Report to accompany the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2022 (S. Rept. 117–37) and in the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence 
Report to accompany the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (H. Rept. 
117–156). 
The Executive Branch is further directed 
as follows: 
Assessment of Intelligence Community Counter-
narcotics Capabilities 
The Committees direct the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, in consultation with 
such other Federal Government entities as 
the Director determines appropriate, to sub-
mit an assessment to the congressional in-
telligence committees within 120 days of en-
actment of this Act, on the status of the In-
telligence Community’s (1) counternarcotics 
capabilities and resourcing with regard to in-
telligence collection and analysis; (2) oper-
ational support to foreign liaison partners; 
and (3) operational capacity to support the 
counteractions mission of the Federal Gov-
ernment. The assessment shall be submitted 
in unclassified form, but may include a clas-
sified annex. 
Assessment of Intelligence Community’s Intel-
ligence-Sharing Relationships with Latin 
American Partners in Counternarcotics. 
The Committees direct the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, in consultation with 
such other Federal Government entities as 
the Director determines appropriate, to sub-
mit an assessment to the congressional in-
telligence committees within 120 days of en-
actment of this Act, on the intelligence- 
sharing relationships of the Intelligence 
Community with foreign partners in Latin 
America on counternarcotics matters. The 
assessment shall be submitted in unclassi-
fied form, but may include a classified 
annex. 
Report on Intelligence Community Support to 
Visas Mantis Program 
The Committees direct the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, in consultation with 
such other Federal Government entities as 
the Director determines appropriate, to sub-
mit a report to the congressional intel-
ligence committees within 120 days of enact-
ment of this Act, on intelligence matters re-
lating to the Visas Mantis program, includ-
ing efforts by (1) the Intelligence Commu-
nity to provide and plan for effective intel-
ligence support to such program; and (2) hos-
tile intelligence services to exploit such pro-
gram or any other program by which visas 
for admission to the United States are 
issued. The report shall be submitted in un-
classified form but may include a classified 
annex, as necessary. 
Assessment and Report on Interagency Commu-
nication Relating to Efforts to Address 
Anomalous Health Incidents 
The Committees direct the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to (1) conduct an assess-
ment of how the various elements of the In-
telligence Community are coordinating or 
collaborating with each other and with ele-
ments of the Federal Government that are 
not part of the Intelligence Community in 
their efforts to address anomalous health in-
cidents, and (2) submit a report to the con-
gressional intelligence committees within 
180 days of enactment of this Act on the find-
ings of the Director with respect to the as-
sessment. The report submitted pursuant to 
subsection shall be submitted in unclassified 
form, but may include a classified annex. 
Reporting on Occurrence of Anomalous Health 
Incidents 
The Committees direct that, whenever the 
head of an element of the Intelligence Com-
munity becomes aware of a report of an 
anomalous health incident occurring among 
the employees or contractors of the element, 
no later than 90 days after each incident, the 
head of the element shall submit to the con-
gressional intelligence committees a brief 
report on the reported incident. The Com-
mittees further direct that this reporting re-
quirement shall cease upon joint notice from 
the congressional intelligence committees to 
the Director of National Intelligence. 
Report on Cooperation by Intelligence Agencies 
of Key Democratic Countries Regarding 
Technological Competition with China 
The Committees direct the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to submit a report to the 
congressional intelligence committees with-
in 180 days of enactment of this Act, on the 
status of current cooperation among the in-
telligence agencies of key democratic coun-
tries and key partners and allies of the 
United States in order to track and analyze 
the following: 
1. Technology capabilities and gaps among 
allied and partner countries of the United 
States; 
2. Current capabilities of China in critical 
technologies and components; 
3. The efforts of China to buy startups, 
conduct joint ventures, and invest in specific 
technologies globally; 
4. The technology development of China in 
key technology sectors; 
5. The efforts of China relating to stand-
ard-setting forums; and 
6. Supply chain vulnerabilities for key 
technology sectors; 
The Committees further direct that the re-
port shall include a plan to address any defi-
ciencies identified in the report with respect 
to the cooperation described in such sub-
section and suggested areas for increased co-
operation. 
STEM Technology Fellowship 
The Committees direct the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence, in coordi-
nation with the Central Intelligence Agency,

Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National 
Reconnaissance Office, and any other rel-
evant Intelligence Community elements, to 
conduct and present to the congressional in-
telligence committees, within 180 days after 
enactment of this Act, a feasibility study ex-
amining the benefits of creating a Science, 
Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) fel-
lowship for the Intelligence Community, and 
whether such a fellowship would help allevi-
ate the Intelligence Community’s workforce 
shortages and retention challenges in STEM 
fields. The study shall include: 
1. A comprehensive assessment of the IC’s 
current and future workforce needs in high 
demand STEM fields, such as data science, 
cybersecurity, computer network exploi-
tation, software development, and artificial 
intelligence/machine learning, including:

ligence Community’s current positions and 
career categories are sufficient to track and 
retain high demand STEM employees, and 
b. An assessment of workforce needs by 
grade, category, and position descriptions. 
2. An overview of Intelligence Community 
programs aimed at developing and recruiting 
new and mid-career hires in STEM fields; 
3. Proposed timelines for converting fel-
lows and interns to permanent employees; 
4. Mechanisms by which the Intelligence 
Community could use such a fellowship or 
internship to address shortfalls in diversity 
among the workforce; and 
5. An assessment of the authorities and re-
sources required to establish an Intelligence 
Community-wide STEM technology fellow-
ship. 
f 
CYBER INCIDENT REPORTING FOR 
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the Cyber Inci-
dent Reporting for Critical Infrastruc-
ture Act of 2022, which is included as 
division Y in the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act of 2022. Cyber attacks and 
ransomware attacks are a serious na-
tional security threat that have af-
fected everything from our energy sec-
tor to the Federal Government and 
Americans’ own sensitive information. 
The SolarWinds breach demonstrated 
how broad the ripple effects of these at-
tacks can be, affecting hundreds or 
even thousands of entities connected to 
the 
initial 
target. 
As 
cyber 
and 
ransomware attacks continue to in-
crease, the Federal Government must 
be able to quickly coordinate a re-
sponse and hold bad actors account-
able. 
Especially now, as the threat of Rus-
sian cyber attacks looms in light of 
Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine, 
we shouldn’t be relying on voluntary 
reporting to protect our crucial infra-
structure. The Federal Government 
needs to know when vital sectors of our 
economy are affected by a breach so 
that the full resources of the Federal 
Government can be mobilized to re-
spond and mitigate their impacts. 
This bipartisan bill will take signifi-
cant steps to strengthen cybersecurity 
protections, ensure that CISA is at the 
forefront of our Nation’s response to 
serious breaches, and most impor-
tantly, require timely reporting of 
these attacks to the Federal Govern-
ment so that we can better prevent fu-
ture incidents and hold attackers ac-
countable. 
The plain text of the statute makes 
Congress’ intent clear: although the re-
ports 
themselves—and 
any 
‘‘communication[s], 
document[s], 
material[s], or other record[s] created 
for the sole purpose of preparing, draft-
ing or submitting’’ those reports—may 
not be received in evidence, the FBI 
and other law enforcement entities 
nevertheless 
may, 
as 
appropriate,

make use of reported information in 
their investigations of a cyber inci-
dent. In other words, the FBI cannot 
attach the report filed with CISA in a 
warrant application or submit it in evi-
dence in a trial but, if provided infor-
mation from reports under the process 
outlined in the statute, may as appro-
priate use information contained in the 
reports and derived from them for a 
range of purposes, including getting a 
warrant and prosecuting bad actors. 
Further, this statute also is not in-
tended to prohibit or discourage enti-
ties from reporting to CISA and law en-
forcement concurrently. 
The language of this bill makes clear 
that the information may be used for 
cybersecurity 
or 
investigative 
pur-
poses. Section 2245 clearly states that 
reports submitted to CISA under this 
provision can be used for ‘‘the purpose 
of 
preventing, 
investigating, 
dis-
rupting, or prosecuting an offense aris-
ing out of a cyber incident reported 
pursuant to [the bill’s requirements or 
voluntary provisions].’’ Nor are facts 
developed during an FBI investigation 
of the relevant cyber incident using 
other authorities, including similar 
facts that may also have been disclosed 
to the Federal Government in the re-
port 
to 
CISA, 
‘‘communication[s], 
document[s], 
material[s], 
or 
other 
record[s]’’ subject to the evidentiary 
restrictions in 2245(c)(3). 
Such actions by the FBI to hold ac-
countable, disrupt, or deter perpetra-
tors of cyber attacks are consistent 
with our goal of encouraging entities 
to disclose cyber incidents to CISA, 
which will share the information ap-
propriately with other Federal agen-
cies. As stakeholders work through the 
rulemaking process, we look forward to 
working with them to ensure that con-
gressional intent is not misinterpreted 
and that this legislation is imple-
mented as intended. 
This balance ensures both that enti-
ties are encouraged to and feel pro-
tected in disclosing cyber incidents and 
that law enforcement agencies may 
make full use of evidence, gathered 
through a variety of means, needed to 
detect, disrupt, and deter perpetrators 
of attacks.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION 
ESSAY CONTEST 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
since 2010, I have sponsored a State of 
the Union essay contest for Vermont 
high school students. This contest 
gives students in my State the oppor-
tunity to articulate what issues they 
would prioritize if they were President 
of the United States. 
This is the contest’s 12th year, and I 
would like to congratulate the 409 stu-
dents who participated. It is truly 
heartening to see so many young peo-
ple engaged in finding solutions for the 
problems that face our country. To my 
mind, this is what democracy is all 
about. 
I am very proud to enter into the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the essays sub-
mitted by these Vermont high school 
students. 
The material follows: 
WINNER, SASHA LANN, BRATTLEBORO UNION 
HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE 
Citizens’ rights to vote may be the most 
fundamental aspect of our democracy, but 
there is a growing effort to limit it. Increas-
ing voter suppression and restrictive voting 
laws is an issue that must be addressed, as it 
has grown from a gradual build to a rush of 
constant new legislation that could do per-
manent damage if ignored. Voter suppression 
is one of the United States’ biggest threats 
to democracy, and the way to address it may 
be to enact legislation that ensures all 
Americans have equal access to voting and 
have their votes counted. 
Recently, the United States has seen a 
massive uptick in legislation restricting vot-
ing in large sections of the country. In 2021 
alone, 99 bills were introduced in 31 states to 
restrict voting. 34 were passed into law. The 
laws strengthen ID requirements, limit drop 
boxes and mail voting, increase opportuni-
ties for voter purges, and introduce criminal 
penalties for election officers who help vot-
ers return mail ballots. These laws exces-
sively target BIPOC communities. Young 
voters are also made vulnerable by this legis-
lation. This attack on our voting system, 
though disproportionately affecting commu-
nities of color, will harm the entire country 
and make us vulnerable to authoritarianism 
and the collapse of our democracy alto-
gether. 
Enacting effective voting rights legislation 
can be a lengthy and difficult process. There 
are already bills in progress that have passed 
the House, but are being blocked by Repub-
licans via the filibuster. As soon as the fili-
buster can be changed, we can continue to 
make progress. In the meantime, the best so-
lution may be to do what we can to prevent 
lawmakers from signing more restrictive 
legislation into law. Part of this solution re-
lies on companies ending support and cam-
paign contributions for lawmakers respon-
sible for this legislation. Companies and 
businesses could play an essential role in 
standing up to these efforts. However, com-
munity and business support will not be 
enough to prevent suppressive legislation for 
long. 
There are several solutions that could stop 
the onslaught of voter restriction laws long 
term, starting with federal legislation to 
protect voting rights and remove obstacles 
for those facing difficulty casting votes. 
There should be laws to enforce automatic 
registration, restore voter rights for former 
prisoners, and increase resources for election 
boards to ensure security. Election Day 
could also be made a holiday so citizens have 
free time to vote, and each state should set 
up independent redistricting commissions to 
avoid gerrymandering. If used together, 
these methods will greatly improve access to 
voting. Voter suppression and restrictive 
voting laws are threatening the integrity of 
our democracy, and we can counteract them 
by passing legislation that protects citizens’ 
say in the course of the country through 
their votes. If nothing is done, we may see 
the fall of our democracy as we know it. 
These are the steps needed to be taken to 
preserve this cornerstone of our country. 
SECOND PLACE, EVA FRAZIER, CHAMPLAIN 
VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR 
In the past few months, millions of people 
have lost rights over their bodies, their 
health, and their futures. As countless states 
across the country move to almost totally 
limit abortion, I fear for all people who may 
become pregnant in these affected areas. I 
fear for those without money to travel to ob-
tain a safe abortion, for those expectant 
mothers experiencing a medical condition 
forced to choose between their life or their 
child’s, and for the youth without proper 
education, suddenly finding themselves with 
no choice over their lives. 
Two things happen when politicians ban or 
block abortions: unsafe abortions or children 
being born to people who can’t take care of 
them. Many will die, and it is almost always 
poor, BIPOC, and marginalized people. The 
state of reproductive rights in this country 
is an aggressive violation of human rights. 
To combat the alarming issues affecting 
reproductive rights locally, nationally, and 
internationally, I would propose a three- 
tiered approach to provide reproductive serv-
ices to all who need them. First, at the state 
level, Vermont needs to amend our state 
Constitution, and protect the right to abor-
tion, without barrier, forever. If Vermont 
state legislators succeed in passing this 
amendment, currently known as Prop 5, 
Vermont will become the first state to pro-
tect the right to reproductive health care ac-
cess. In addition to legally protecting the 
right to abortion, Vermont state legislators 
must increase the budget for health care cen-
ters that perform abortions. 
Nationally, Congress must pass two pieces 
of legislation. First, Congress must repeal 
the Hyde Amendment. As the ACLU states, 
‘‘Passed by Congress in 1976, the Hyde 
Amendment excludes abortion from the com-
prehensive health care services provided to 
low-income people by the Federal Govern-
ment through Medicaid.’’ Low-income people 
are the least likely to have transportation 
and funds to obtain an abortion, and the 
Hyde amendment keeps low income people 
from having equal access to determine their 
futures. 
Reproductive rights are not only at stake 
nationally, but internationally. Currently, 
the U.S. will not fund any international 
health care centers that provide abortions, 
which often then prohibits them from pro-
viding lifesaving treatments for malaria, 
HIV/AIDS, and other medical care. This dra-
conian policy, known as the Global Gag 
Rule, was first introduced by President 
Reagan, and recently reinstated by President 
Trump. U.S. congressional representatives 
have a duty to pass legislation, known as the 
Global HER Act, that would overturn the 
Global Gag Rule, and cement the U.S. as a 
country that provides necessary foreign aid, 
instead of risking millions of lives. 
As people turn to illegal abortions, it is 
crucial that lawmakers work to protect their 
citizens by passing federal law and upholding 
the International Human Rights declaration, 
giving humans freedom over their bodies and 
health care choices.

Throughout history, America has been

tion—the ambassadors to our future—seem 
to experience it more severely. According to

currently faces hunger, and the same can be 
said for one in six children. Furthermore, 
hunger in our youth has only festered with 
the effects of the Covid–19 pandemic. Com-
pared to 10 million previously, the number of 
food-insecure children in America has in-
creased to approximately 12 million. Not-
withstanding our nation’s immense pros-
perity and value for education, our students 
experience inaccessibility to affordable, nu-
tritious food, and are seldom provided with 
the assistance they need. 
Though the discussion of universal free 
meals has long existed, the pandemic proved 
to be the catalyst for its execution. Through 
action on behalf of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, our government will provide 
free breakfast and lunch to schools nation-
wide throughout the 2021–2022 school year. 
Students now have the opportunity to be 
created 
equal 
in 
their 
education 
and 
wellbeing. Recent studies from the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation have concluded 
that the initiative has even improved both 
student behavior and performance. Though 
abundant are the benefits of this Covid-miti-
gation strategy, the implementation of uni-
versal school meals is still seen as a tem-
porary measure. Even long after these chal-
lenging times, however, the pandemic’s re-
percussions will persist, if not worsen, if not 
addressed. Though they may initially seem 
like a significant financial hurdle, universal 
school meals are a progressive, bipartisan, 
and necessary first effort in resolving the 
issue of food insecurity. 
One significant advantage to implementing 
universal free meals is that it would perma-
nently eliminate the nation’s preexisting 
free and reduced lunch system—an inequi-
table, stigma-inducing program designed to 
assist students facing hunger. With strict 
eligibility requirements, free and reduced 
meals were rarely provided to all those who 
needed them, and the income-based aid sys-
tem couldn’t accurately account for criteria- 
meeting households that were nevertheless 
food insecure for other reasons. Additionally, 
applications for the program were not re-
quired, which excluded many more who po-
tentially qualified, yet didn’t apply. The pro-
gram offered no way to adequately gauge 
whether or not one needed assistance. 
Nonetheless, there remains one primary 
barrier to the support of universal free 
meals: their funding. Taxpayers fear they 
would wholly assume the burden of a poten-
tially expensive feat. However, only 0.3 per-
cent of the federal budget is currently re-
served for child nutrition programs, and this 
cost is distributed nationwide among tax-
payers. Evidently, reapportionment of the 
budget to increase this expenditure would 
neither reduce spending allocated to other 
departments nor increase local tax rates 
greatly. 
We must allow ourselves to imagine an 
America where a free meal, despite the tradi-
tional adage, is indeed possible; an America 
that ensures our youth’s prosperity, during 
and following times of crisis. We must con-
sider the future, and pass sustainable, logical 
legislation; legislation providing every stu-
dent with the baseline liberty of a satisfied 
stomach in their daily pursuit of knowledge.

We have all seen the images; sea turtles 
with straws jammed in their noses, fish en-
trapped within plastic six-pack yokes, even 
whales with bellies full of plastic trash. 
There is no doubt that our plastic pollution 
is not just a problem, it is a calamity. Ac-
cording to USA Today, ‘‘Different kinds of 
plastic take anywhere between 400 and 1,000 
years to degrade in a landfill . . . So much 
plastic is thrown away every year that it’s 
enough to circle the Earth four times.’’ That 
means at least 6.3 billion metric tons of plas-
tic waste is being added by the day. Some-
thing must be done, but what? I believe that 
there should be a national ban on plastic, or 
some other government-controlled incentive 
to switch to plastic alternatives. 
There are many existing plastic alter-
natives already available, but extensive use 
of and investment in them has not yet been 
seen. On Eartheasy, a site that lists plastic 
alternatives, they note that, ‘‘finding alter-
natives to common items like plastic bottles 
and plastic packaging is becoming increas-
ingly easier—and not a moment too soon for 
our plastic-choked planet.’’ Examples of 
these plastic alternatives include, but are 
not limited to, bamboo, seaweed, wood, cloth 
for bags, and for multi-use but non-bio-
degradable substances, glass and stainless 
steel for replacing one-use items. The possi-
bilities are limitless on what ways we can re-
place plastic, and our technology and inno-
vation provide us with new, sustainable op-
tions, but how do we convince the world to 
use these alternatives? 
If we really want to make progress against 
our plastic pandemonium, we cannot leave it 
up to individual people to consider plastic al-
ternatives. This is a collective issue we need 
to address first as a nation, and then the 
world. Many solutions to this problem have 
been given, including taxation on plastic 
products, and even total bans, but no clear 
decision has been reached. Taxes would mean 
a smoother transition, and the money made 
off of plastic usage would go towards dis-
couraging that same occurrence, as well as 
cleaning up plastic pollution. A ban would 
outright prevent companies and individuals 
from consuming plastic, which may nega-
tively impact people’s lives. I believe that a 
nationwide ban is the best solution. Tax-
ation would slow the problem, and raise 
money for the government, but the problem 
would still exist. Banning plastic, though 
tough, would force ourselves to use alter-
natives, and without the incoming waste, we 
could focus on cleaning the ocean. 
Though plastic bans would offer one solu-
tion, there is no one right answer to this 
issue. As long as we continue the conversa-
tion and look for ways to prevail and take 
action, we still have the devotion to over-
come this problem. With our advances in 
science and technology, and the combined 
help of our government and fellow citizens, 
we can conquer our carelessness and restore 
this beautiful planet we inhabit to its former 
glory. 
PENELOPE DEROSSET, BURLINGTON HIGH 
SCHOOL, FRESHMAN 
Some people in this country see no need 
for feminism. They say: ‘‘Men and women 
are equal. They have the same rights under 
law.’’ But that isn’t true. The only right the 
Constitution explicitly grants to both men 
and women is the right to vote. And the few 
rights women have, the right to abortion for 
one, are constantly called into question. The 
solution? An amendment introduced in 1923. 
Ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment 
(ERA), which explicitly grants all rights 
equally to all genders, would grant a layer of 
legal protection to women’s rights which are 
so often under threat. 
Laws protecting women’s rights are con-
stantly limited in their ability to protect 
women at all. By mid-2021, a record amount 
of anti-abortion legislation had already been 
enacted by states. Limitations requiring pa-
rental consent or banning abortion past a 
certain point in pregnancy make it impos-
sible for many women to get an abortion. 
This may endanger the pregnant person’s 
life. If a woman chooses to stay pregnant, 
she may face challenges such as pay dis-
crimination, employers refusing to accom-
modate her temporary disability, or being 
fired. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act 
(PDA), the only federal law against work-
place pregnancy discrimination, is consist-
ently interpreted too narrowly to be ade-
quate protection. A report by the Center for 
Employment Equity at UMass Amherst says: 
‘‘Activists and politicians have argued that 
by only providing a comparative, rather than 
absolute, right to accommodation, current 
laws stop short of guaranteeing protection 
for all pregnant workers.’’ While women may 
appear to be protected by law against work-
place pregnancy discrimination the truth is 
many are not. This leaves large numbers of 
people vulnerable. We must work to defend 
these rights or risk them disappearing. 
The ERA would solve this issue by explic-
itly stating a constitutional position against 
gender discrimination. Some states have al-
ready passed equal rights amendments or 
have ERA-like language in their state con-
stitutions, and using these, Connecticut and 
New Mexico have found laws restricting 
Medicaid coverage of abortion unconstitu-
tional. With regards to pregnancy discrimi-
nation, an article by Robin Bleuweiss pub-
lished by the Center for American Progress 
states: ‘‘The ERA could provide additional 
reasoning, grounded in constitutional pro-
tections, to challenge policies that effec-
tively exclude individuals seeking pregnancy 
accommodations from the protection of the 
law, as well as to ensure equitable treatment 
and better conditions for pregnant workers.’’ 
With the added support of constitutional 
protection, policies currently legal under the 
PDA could change and finally grant preg-
nant women equality. 
There is no doubt adding the ERA to the 
Constitution would have a big impact on the 
essential rights of women. Implementing 
this solution would be simple. All the states 
required to ratify this amendment have. The 
only obstacle is the time limit. Congress has 
already exercised its power to extend the 
time limit once before, so why couldn’t it do 
so again? To quote Alice Paul, revolutionary 
suffragist and the first to propose the ERA, 
‘‘To me, there is nothing complicated about 
ordinary equality.’’ 
JOCELYN DUNN, ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
On September 1, 2021, a law banning abor-
tion from as early as six weeks into preg-
nancy went into effect in Texas. The Su-
preme Court’s failure to stop Texas Senate 
Bill 8 has paved the way for other states to 
mimic actions with similar bills that di-
rectly challenge Roe v. Wade. In December, 
the state of Mississippi asked the Supreme 
Court to uphold its outlaw on abortion at 15 
weeks of pregnancy in the case of Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The 
new reality of abortion access is a terrify-
ingly imperative issue, and the nation’s 
highest court has never been so close to up-
holding a ban that so blatantly ignores the 
precedent set by Roe v. Wade. Political shifts 
that threaten to undermine Roe v. Wade will 
harm many, and simply should be unaccept-
able to anyone who cares about the health of 
women. 
Since 1973, Roe v. Wade has provided safe, 
accessible 
abortion 
services 
to 
women 
throughout the country. The precedent set 
by Roe v. Wade affirms that it is a woman’s 
right to have an abortion under the Four-
teenth Amendment without excessive gov-
ernment restriction. Since the case decision, 
the Supreme Court has been continuously 
called upon to decide whether specific abor-
tion statutes violate a woman’s right to pri-
vacy. However, under the current process of 
examination, many abortion restrictions 
have been upheld and the lasting constraints

of these harmful laws have opened the door 
to limits on the ability of women to make 
the personal decision of ending a pregnancy. 
The Supreme Court’s upcoming decision in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion has left the future of Roe v. Wade at 
risk. According to Planned Parenthood, if 
Roe v. Wade is overturned, 26 states in the 
country could immediately act on banning 
abortion through existing policies. This 
means that 36 million women could soon live 
in a state that criminalizes almost all abor-
tion services. 
With the increasingly likely overturning of 
Roe v. Wade on the horizon, Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi has announced that the Senate will 
soon hold a vote on legislation that would 
ensure a nationwide right to abortion. In 
September 2021, the House of Representa-
tives passed the Women’s Health Protection 
Act (WHPA). If the WHPA becomes a federal 
law, abortion access would be protected from 
not only bans but also medically unneces-
sary 
restrictions 
such 
as 
mandatory 
ultrasounds, biased counseling, and waiting 
periods. The WHPA would create a statutory 
right for health care providers to perform 
abortion services, and a corresponding right 
for their patients to receive those services, 
free from invasive restrictions. 
The United States is on the brink of an un-
precedented crisis regarding women’s health. 
Restrictions on Roe v. Wade have plagued 
American women for decades and the right 
to make private decisions free from barriers 
is more crucial than ever to the personal dig-
nity and autonomy of women. Eliminating 
health care restrictions is imperative to re-
productive justice and passing the WHPA is 
an essential step toward safeguarding access 
to abortion.

ACADEMY FAIRFAX, SENIOR 
The opioid crisis and incarceration for non-
violent offenders isn’t the solution for these 
addicts. It has an emotional, physical, and 
economical struggle many are facing and 
have been facing. People need to have com-
passion and understand that addiction is a 
disease, not a choice. Children, youth, and 
families are affected by opioid use. No one 
chooses drugs over their own children, no 
one chooses to steal from their loved ones, 
no one chooses to physically harm them-
selves, no one chooses to have their children 
taken from them. 
There are many issues and concerns that 
exist within this topic. I can relate to this 
very well. In 2009 my mother developed her 
relationship with heroin, what most call the 
‘‘devil’’. My mother was a kind, hard-
working, 
funny, 
determined, 
confident 
woman. But since this disease has taken over 
her, she’s not as present. Watching my moth-
er struggling on a daily basis from being sick 
to running out of the home scrounging for 
the next ‘‘fix’’. It affected not only her, but 
it affected her family who were a witness to 
this. Many legal systems knew about her ad-
diction but didn’t support her nor did they 
provide her with the necessary resources. 
They focused more on removing things from 
her life and punishing her for something that 
was controlling every part of her. 
There is a story that stands out to me 
called ‘‘Hooked’’. It was about a vulnerable 
woman who was prescribed opioids, she in-
stantly became an addict. She was clean for 
a while, but relapsed multiple times. She was 
incarcerated, denied medical attention, and 
then died. Incarceration for these addicts is 
not helping them. Incarceration does not 
prepare them for sobriety when released. 
They need affordable treatment and support 
from a substance abuse counselor, and re-
sources that will set them up for success. 
There needs to be more resources and af-
fordable treatment for individuals struggling 
to beat opioid addiction. I will continue to 
speak on this until there’s a significant 
change our government takes far beyond 
what’s been done. I know that Senator Sand-
ers introduced amendments to strengthen 
the opioid crisis response in 2018. In addition 
to your amendments to the opioid bill, I be-
lieve Congress should also continue to pro-
vide additional funding like the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The 
law focuses on treating people rather than 
incarcerating people. Congress passed the 
bill giving only $181 million in funds for 
opioid programs. The federal government 
was expecting $920 million to help expand 
their treatment capacity with each state re-
ceiving money depending on the severity of 
the 
epidemic. 
Having 
funding 
would 
strengthen and support prevention, treat-
ment, and medication access. We must con-
tinue to help those who are like my mom 
and we must honor these families who are 
waking up daily facing the nightmare of 
opioid addiction. This disease does not dis-
criminate, it can be the lawyer, the doctor, 
the son, the daughter, the mother, and/or the 
father. This is all the more reason to stay fo-
cused on this and make a change. 
ANNA PRINGLE, ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
Not only is America experiencing a Covid 
pandemic, but America is also experiencing a 
loneliness epidemic. While loneliness is not 
diagnoseable medically or psychologically, 
it’s associated with a variety of disorders 
and health issues such as depression, anx-
iety, and concurrently, increased suicide 
rates. As said in the Harvard Graduate 
School of Education Report, 61 percent of 
young adults feel serious loneliness after the 
pandemic. 
As Covid continues, people all over the 
U.S. are accepting isolation. There are sim-
ple solutions to this loneliness epidemic, for 
example, a simple phone call or Facetime to 
a friend. There are also more complex solu-
tions; an example being in the grocery store. 
According to Vice, the Netherlands is intro-
ducing chat registers; registers where em-
ployees will be trained to create small talk 
with customers who aren’t in a rush. This is 
an effort sponsored by the Netherland gov-
ernment in hopes to help battle loneliness. 
The Netherland government also created a 
24/7 loneliness hotline, both the registers and 
hotline are a part of the ‘‘one against loneli-
ness’’ program. This is a great example of a 
country doing more to help people in need. 
In America, mental health is not a top pri-
ority, but the impacts of mental health are 
astronomical. American citizens are suf-
fering at an increasing rate because they are 
so isolated due to Covid. Since being lonely 
can be chronic, the U.S. needs to do more to 
help. It is not possible for one solution to 
single-handedly end the epidemic of loneli-
ness; instead many solutions will have to 
come together. Some examples of solutions 
are following what the Netherlands did, cre-
ating a hotline or chat registers. Another so-
lution is bringing awareness to this topic of 
how quarantining from Covid has impacted 
mental health. This could inspire people to 
call a loved one; especially the ones that live 
alone. Simple actions like calling a loved 
one could have a huge impact, this could re-
mind a lonely person that they have people 
to talk to and therefore it can make some-
one feel less secluded. Social media is a huge 
part of everyone’s life, putting information 
out there on the impact that loneliness has 
on people could one hundred percent make a 
difference. 
Mental health issues are substantial in 
America today. There are many ways that 
America can do more for the loneliness cri-
sis, creating a healthier, happier country. 
ISABELLE TUPPER, BRATTLEBORO UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE 
As James Earl Jones reveals, ‘‘One of the 
hardest things in life is having words in your 
heart that you can’t utter’’. Nowadays, black 
Americans (nationwide) are suffering from 
declining mental health; one in every three 
black people seek assistance when strug-
gling, and roughly 1.4 million black people 
are experiencing crises. As a result, suicide 
rates are increasing and citizens are silently 
suffering. Therefore, black mental health 
must become a priority. 
In 
predominantly 
black 
communities, 
mental health is overlooked—despite its 
damaging impacts. Injustices are amplified 
by unforeseen circumstances that deplete 
one’s quality of life. For instance, ‘‘Anxiety 
and depression symptoms have more than 
tripled since 2019, [ . . . ]’’ and pandemic-re-
lated homelessness and unemployment left 
‘‘[ . . . ] black Americans shouldering the 
heaviest burden’’ (Fowers and Wan). Addi-
tionally, the murder of George Floyd resur-
faced trauma for countless black Americans 
and caused mental health issues to spike five 
percent. Lastly, black people with mental 
health issues struggle to gain relief due to 
stigma and insufficient BIPOC medical pro-
fessionals. Consequently, this urgent matter 
generates despondency, leading black indi-
viduals to isolate themselves. 
Provisionally, this country must fulfill 
black individuals’ needs whilst identifying 
propitious resources. Through survey, the 
public shall expunge injurious practices and 
distribute assets alongside governmental ad-
visors. Parties must consider privileges of 
non-black people and prioritize equality. 
Schools must incorporate free courses—run 
by qualified educators—to help young people 
identify mental illness. Classes must be ac-
cessible and non-discriminatory, and iden-
tity must not prevent admittance. School- 
based clinicians will best ensure students’ 
access to counseling; psychiatrist David Hen-
derson, reports ‘‘about 25 percent of African 
Americans seek mental health care, com-
pared to 40 percent of whites’’ because of im-
pediments regarding accessibility (McLean 
Harvard Medical School Affiliate). Progres-
sively, the government must accommodate 
affordable healthcare. Mental health must be 
covered by insurance and funds shall be sup-
plied by the one percent of taxpayers. All re-
maining funds must go towards mental 
health facilities in need. Assuming that de-
mands are met, progress will ensue. 
Over time, it will be crucial to break the 
stigma surrounding black mental health. 
Once honest conversations commence, politi-
cally-correct terminology must be applied 
and blatant irreverence shall be condemned. 
Publicly, black mental health advocates 
shall assemble and enlighten uninformed in-
dividuals, and mental health care providers 
must advertise openly. Simultaneously, the 
mental health field must employ more peo-
ple of color. BIPOC positions will be filled 
when salaries are livable, staff is receptive, 
and job openings have renowned availability. 
Hired professionals must have ample train-
ing, prior to or upon their employment. Fi-
nally, if employees of color exit, all busi-
nesses must hire new BIPOC staff to diver-
sify America’s perspectives. 
Black mental health is a nationwide con-
cern and all people must fight to restore it. 
Due to Covid losses and natural disasters, 
this country is facing a level of despair that 
only multiplies when considering mental 
health. In black communities, conditions are 
abysmal and there is dire need for improve-
ment. If circumstances do not ameliorate, 
tragedy will only continue. Nevertheless, 
this country shall work diligently together 
and utilize its power to create immense 
change.

The single most threatening issue our 
world must deal with today is climate 
change. It is crucial that our government 
doesn’t ignore climate change and its im-
pacts that will affect everybody. Climate 
change is going to become much worse in the 
upcoming years and we have already started 
to face devastating effects. Extreme weather 
has destroyed communities and will not stop 
any time soon. Tropical storms and sea lev-
els rising on the coasts will soon make towns 
and cities uninhabitable. Health risks will 
become worse and worse such as deaths from 
extreme weather storms, air pollution, water 
and food supply impacts. The downfall of 
countless communities will affect economic 
prosperity. Extreme weather such as hurri-
canes and flooding will wipe out entire com-
munities, leaving them in poverty. Droughts 
have a negative impact on harvests and will 
increase food insecurity. As migration in-
creases due to the adaptation of sea levels 
rising, resources will become more and more 
limited. As a nation, we cannot ignore cli-
mate change anymore. 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ Green 
New Deal would give our nation the step in 
the right direction of taking an action that 
will sustain our planet for generations to 
come. Our federal government has not al-
lowed the passage of this deal despite its im-
mense benefits for our country. It is stated 
to create 20 million jobs, which would im-
prove our country’s unemployment issue 
greatly. 
The deal suggests using solutions such as 
only renewable energy will catapult our 
progress. We need to stop sending our na-
tion’s tax dollars to fossil fuel companies in 
the form of subsidies. Instead, we can invest 
that money into clean forms of energy such 
as solar. Fossil fuels are the reason why our 
earth has been increasingly warming up. The 
carbon in the air needs to be taken out of our 
atmosphere and put back into the ground 
where it came from. 
We can help this process in our own state 
of Vermont by stopping the overuse of chem-
ical fertilizers and pesticides on our farm-
land. This use of chemicals is killing habi-
tats in our soils and causing pollution. If we 
adopt more organic methods of farming and 
take care of our soil, the crops, plants and 
organisms living in the soil can help seques-
ter carbon from the air. Another simple solu-
tion to drawing carbon from the air is plant-
ing many, many trees. Other countries have 
already implemented this solution and there 
is no reason why we can’t as well. 
Yes, applying these solutions will take 
time, money, and resources. But the positive 
outcomes from this deal are necessary and 
worth it. This should be the main focus of 
our government right now because it is a 
global emergency and soon it will be too 
late.∑
