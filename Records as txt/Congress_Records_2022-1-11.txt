No. 7 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CORREA).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 11, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable J. LUIS

this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

FIGHTING FOR WORKING 
FAMILIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the beginning of my 
final year in Congress. Throughout my 
five terms, I have always made work-
ing families my number one priority. 
So, in my final year, what is at the 
top of my list to make sure that I am 
focusing on? Well, right now it is rein-
stating the child tax credit that just 
expired this month. Hardworking fami-
lies who are just trying to get by have 
come to count on that support month 
to month since we passed that last 
year. 
Now, there are 71,000 families, just in 
the congressional district that I serve, 
who won’t see that deposit into their 
bank account starting this month. So 
let’s get to work. 
In Illinois, more than half of the chil-
dren living in poverty don’t have a seat 
in the pre-K classroom. So let’s get to 
work. 
Parents across our Nation are spend-
ing a good chunk of their take-home 
pay for the childcare that they need in 
order to be able to go to work, and it is 
our job to help make that more afford-
able. So let’s get to work. 
I have got 1 year left in Congress and 
so much to accomplish, so I say to my 
own staff, I say to myself, I say to ev-
erybody in this body, let’s get to work. 
f 
KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN MUST BE 
A PRIORITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, against 
science and common sense, many tradi-
tional government schools continue to 
shut children out of the classroom. 
The Biden administration has repeat-
edly put the political agenda of teach-
ers’ unions above the needs of children. 
Throughout this pandemic, the Biden 
administration has ignored the con-
cerns of parents and has, instead, craft-
ed its COVID–19 school guidelines in 
accord with the demands of union 
bosses. 
The Biden administration’s Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
consulted 
American 
Federation 
of 
Teachers, 
AFT, 
President 
Randi 
Weingarten for help in shaping guid-
ance on school reopening. Entrusting a 
union boss and major campaign donor 
to make public health decisions is com-
pletely unacceptable. 
Teachers’ unions took full advantage 
of the pandemic. They bullied and co-
erced the Biden administration until 
they got almost everything they asked 
for. Anytime the Biden administration 
resisted their demands, these unions 
had a meltdown, publicly shaming the 
administration, staging sick-outs, and 
making 
their 
demands 
even 
more 
elaborate and unreasonable. 
According to CDC guidance, schools 
can safely stay open. The data proves 
that schools are not and have never 
been a major vector of spread. Yet, 
even with all the scientific data, teach-
ers’ unions are holding their ground at 
the cost of students’ well-being. 
This pandemic has taken a major toll 
on young people. Children, who are at 
the lowest risk of being made seriously 
ill by COVID–19, have been forced out 
of the classrooms by the demands of 
teachers’ unions. 
Forcing students to learn behind a 
screen has led to devastating con-
sequences. According to a report by 
Curriculum Associates, the number of 
students testing at two or more grade 
levels below their own grade has sig-
nificantly increased since the pan-
demic. The numbers are worse for stu-
dents who are already at risk. 
For example, 49 percent of third grad-
ers who come from low-income areas 
are now two or more grade levels be-
hind in reading and math. This is an 
increase of 10 to 12 percent since before 
the pandemic began. 
Because of school closures, many stu-
dents have also been suffering from iso-
lation, depression, and anxiety. It was 
alarming to read that the number of 
ER visits for suspected suicide at-
tempts by teenage girls rose from early 
2019 to early 2021 by 51 percent. 
This is a public health crisis in and of 
itself yet one that is being ignored by 
many of the decisionmakers at both 
the national and local level in favor of 
special interest groups like the AFT.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H12 
January 11, 2022 
That is why Republicans at the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee have been 
fighting so hard to keep schools open. 
We know the stakes are high. 
This pandemic has made it abun-
dantly clear that teachers’ unions, as 
well as the education establishment, 
have too much power. Neither union 
bosses nor bureaucrats in Washington 
should be able to keep our children 
from the classroom. Access to edu-
cation is an important right in this 
country, one that teachers’ unions are 
belittling with their outrageous de-
mands. 
What has the outsized influence of 
teachers’ unions produced? Less school 
choice, falling education standards, ex-
plicit material in school libraries, crit-
ical race theory-inspired curriculum, 
and years of learning loss. 
Teachers’ unions have become far 
less about protecting teachers or stu-
dents and far more about promoting a 
left-wing political agenda. This was 
made clear when the teachers’ unions 
in several major cities joined forces 
with the Democratic Socialists of 
America to demand an eviction mora-
torium and an end to voucher programs 
as conditions for reopening schools. 
The longer we let these union bosses 
take advantage of this pandemic, the 
worse off our students will be. Students 
should no longer take a back seat to 
politics or special interests. 
It is time to stop catering to teach-
ers’ unions and to start serving the 
needs of students. 
f 
RECOGNIZING EDUCATORS AND 
SCHOOL STAFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the resilient, 
dedicated, 
and 
understandably 
ex-
hausted, yet unflagging, educators and 
school staff across the Nation. 
I have spent my career advocating 
for an equitable education system, and 
I am a proud dad of four children who 
are 
products 
of 
Michigan 
public 
schools. In fact, my daughter Molly is 
currently a high school junior who is 
set to graduate next year. I can hardly 
believe it. 
That is why I have been especially 
disheartened when I meet regularly 
with educators and superintendents in 
Macomb and Oakland Counties and 
hear stories of how these frontline 
workers navigate from one crisis to an-
other, seemingly without end. From 
multiple 
COVID–19 
waves 
and 
politicization of commonsense public 
health measures, like masking and 
vaccines, to mass shootings, like the 
Oxford High School tragedy in my 
home county of Oakland County that 
we are still mourning, and startling 
learning loss and social delays. 
Mr. Speaker, our educators, school 
staff, and administrators are not catch-
ing a break. They are working tire-
lessly and meeting daily, even over hol-
iday breaks, to make sure they can 
provide the best learning environment 
for our students. Across the board, 
they reported trouble finding teachers, 
finding bus drivers, finding kitchen 
staff and everything in between. 
Our students are returning to the 
classroom with immense needs in the 
midst of a teacher and substitute 
shortage. All manner of staff and ad-
ministrators, including even super-
intendents themselves, are stepping up 
and entering the classroom as sub-
stitutes. 
One thing is very clear: We need a so-
cietal shift to address the issues 
around staffing, attendance, learning 
loss, and the social and mental health 
needs of our students. As the omicron 
variant continues to surge, we must 
prioritize education and consider it a 
sacred public good instead of an indus-
try, and value our educators and school 
staff by providing living wages, safe 
work environments, and ending the at-
tacks on educators and their unions. 
The pandemic has exposed long-sim-
mering problems, as crises are wont to 
do. It is a time for a fundamental reset; 
time for us to realize that, while mar-
kets do a great job of distributing 
goods and services across the society, 
there are a few social goods that should 
not be determined by market forces 
but, rather, lifted up above them as a 
way to protect our democracy and 
make the healthy functioning of mar-
kets possible in the first place. 
One is public safety. Another is ac-
cess to quality healthcare for every 
person. A third is an excellent public 
education for every child, from pre-
school to community college. 
We cannot continue to put our edu-
cators through the wringer. Longtime 
professionals in my district tell me 
they are hearing from new teachers 
who say they won’t last a couple of 
years, much less decades. 
My response was this: We must re-
store the education profession; the dig-
nity of the education profession; the 
worth and the standing of the edu-
cation profession, no matter how dif-
ficult it is. We must train teachers and 
prepare them for success, offer them 
appropriate pay and benefits, and sup-
port them, not only in the classroom, 
but in our society with the dignity and 
respect they deserve. 
As a member of the House Education 
and Labor Committee, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in continuing the 
fight for robust investments and just 
policies to make sure our country, our 
economy, and our education system 
work for every American, not just the 
wealthy few. 
f 
THE DRUG CRISIS IS DECIMATING 
COMMUNITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the drug cri-
sis that is decimating communities and 
destroying families. 
Earlier this month, the CDC released 
data showing that fentanyl overdoses 
are now the number one killer of Amer-
icans ages 18 to 45: number one killer. 
This data is tragic. No family should 
have to deal with the sudden loss of a 
loved one. 
Fentanyl is often ingested unknow-
ingly, and a dose smaller than the size 
of a penny can be lethal. 
In 2021, President Biden swung open 
the doors to our southern border, and 
the impact of that continues to be neg-
ative. That decision invited drug traf-
fickers into our country. Last year, 
Border Patrol agents seized enough 
fentanyl to kill every man, woman and 
child in my home State of Pennsyl-
vania. 
We cannot solve this crisis while our 
borders remain open. We cannot solve 
this crisis while the Biden administra-
tion fails to act. 
This deadly drug will continue to 
pour into our country if we fail to build 
the wall. It will continue to pour into 
our country if we do not get the border 
agents the support and the tools that 
they need. 
This issue is far too important to 
continue to ignore. Our communities 
continue to suffer. Congress should act 
now to make fentanyl analogs a sched-
ule one narcotic. 
The Biden administration must se-
cure our southern border. Our commu-
nities, they are counting on us to act. 
We can no longer continue to let them 
down. 
f 
SCHOOLS NEED CRITICAL 
INVESTMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to call attention to the crit-
ical investments we are making in our 
schools. Schools are the pillars of our 
communities. They are the places 
where our children learn and grow 
every day. Making sure that these 
spaces are safe for our Nation’s chil-
dren is one of our most important re-
sponsibilities. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, many of 
these facilities are not up to the task. 
School boards have been sounding the 
alarm for years about lead pipes, poor 
air quality, and now COVID–19 issues 
hurting our children’s education. And 
for too long, help has not come. 
b 1015 
But this month, during School Board 
Recognition Month, I am proud to be 
able to tell schools in my district and 
around the country that help is on the 
way. 
Thanks to the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, passed by this 
Chamber, we are bringing billions of 
dollars to make safe, healthy schools 
for our kids. That means billions of 
dollars to remove dangerous lead pipes

from schools; millions of dollars to buy 
masks and protective equipment for 
teachers, staff, and students; and mil-
lions of rapid, accurate COVID tests so 
everyone can get tested and stay safe. 
We are also investing billions to im-
prove air quality in schools across 
America. 
The impact of these investments can-
not be overstated. We all know how 
dangerous lead contamination is for 
our kids. Lead poisoning can cause de-
velopmental 
problems, 
mental 
and 
physical health issues, and even death. 
No child should be poisoned by their 
own school water fountain—not in 
Texas, not in America, not anywhere. 
That is why this law is investing $2.9 
billion to replace lead pipes in Texas 
schools and make sure our children 
have clean, safe drinking water. 
It is for those same reasons, Mr. 
Speaker, that we are also putting tax 
dollars to work for cleaner air in 
schools. Poor air quality hurts stu-
dents every day, making it harder to 
learn and contributing to illnesses like 
asthma. 
Recently, poor air circulation and fil-
ters have been driving up COVID–19 
cases in schools. We can keep our kids 
safe in their schools by installing bet-
ter filters that clean out the COVID 
virus before it travels between class-
rooms; we can keep our kids safe by 
providing them and their teachers with 
masks to help stop the spread; and we 
can keep our kids safe by making sure 
that if anyone does feel sick, they can 
immediately get a free COVID test. 
There are over 193,000 schoolchildren 
in my district. I am proud that the in-
vestments we are making will help 
each and every one of them. These are 
important measures we are taking 
right now to make schools safe and a 
great place to learn and grow for our 
students, for the teachers, the bus driv-
ers, the cafeteria workers, and all 
those that keep our schools open and 
safe. 
Houston ISD alone has over 29,000 
employees working hard every day for 
our kids. They have been on the front 
lines of this pandemic, helping our 
children stay on track, even as this dis-
ease has disrupted almost everything 
in their lives. It is absolutely vital that 
we bring these important tools for safe 
schools to them as well. Making sure 
that our educators and staff have rapid 
tests, masks, and vaccines will keep ev-
eryone 
in 
schools 
stay 
safe 
and 
healthy. 
But we must also finish the job and 
build back better, which will include 
billions for universal pre-K, which 
boosts our education system, and rein-
state the child tax credit, which will 
lift children out of poverty. 
I am proud of the work of this Con-
gress, and I am proud of the critical in-
vestments to my district, in our 
schools, in Texas, and across the coun-
try. 
We have made incredible progress 
this past year to help our educators, 
our students, and our communities 
bounce back from COVID–19. I am 
thankful for the hard work of Presi-
dent Biden and my colleagues in the 
House and the Senate. Thanks to our 
collective efforts, students, teachers, 
and faculty will have safe schools, 
clean water, and a brighter future.

CONGRATULATING MALCOLM 
MEYER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a great man, a devoted 
father and husband, a selfless leader, 
and a legend in Louisiana real estate 
law. 
Malcolm Meyer graduated magna 
cum laude from Tulane University, 
graduated from Tulane Law School, 
and then served 4 years as a JAG offi-
cer in the United States Navy. 
Malcolm Meyer practiced law over 30 
years, taught and mentored students as 
an adjunct professor, and he became a 
leading expert in his field, literally 
writing the book on real estate trans-
action law in Louisiana, the widely 
read and referenced ‘‘Malcolm’s Man-
ual on Louisiana Real Estate.’’ 
Malcolm has used his vast knowledge 
and expertise not only to better his 
colleagues and his profession, but to 
help the disadvantaged in his commu-
nity. Most notably, following the trag-
edy of Hurricane Katrina, Malcolm 
spent countless hours of pro bono work 
protecting the property and belongings 
of the most vulnerable in his State. 
He has been recognized over the 
years for his outstanding volunteer 
service 
by 
organizations, 
including 
Louisiana Appleseed Foundation, Lou-
isiana Land Title Association, and the 
prestigious 
George 
Herbert 
Walker 
Bush’s Points of Light. 
On December 29, Malcolm was named 
the recipient of the 2021 Louisiana 
Land 
Title 
Association 
Lifetime 
Achievement Award. 
Strong countries and vibrant commu-
nities, Mr. Speaker, are not established 
merely because of good laws but be-
cause of good men whose hearts are de-
voted to the sum of all laws: Love thy 
neighbor as thyself. 
That is Malcolm Meyer to his core, 
and I know that unequivocally, Mr. 
Speaker, because he is my father-in- 
law. I am so proud of him, and I want 
to congratulate Big Mouse and send 
our best. We love Big Mouse, and it is 
a well-deserved recognition. 
RECOGNIZING DON MCBEATH 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding west 
Texan, a great partner in delivering 
rural healthcare solutions, and a dear 
friend, Don McBeath. 
Don is retiring from his role as direc-
tor of government relations for the 
Texas Organization of Rural and Com-
munity Hospitals, what we refer to as 
TORCH, where he has been a champion 
for over 150 rural hospitals since 2007. 
Prior to his time with TORCH, Don 
blazed the trail in telehealth by serv-
ing as the director of telemedicine and 
rural health at the Texas Tech Univer-
sity Health Sciences Center. Before 
that, he served as a judge and several 
years in the DA’s office. 
I wish Don and Beverly all the best 
as they move into the next chapter of 
their lives. I thank Don for his friend-
ship and his tremendous contributions 
to rural west Texas. 
CONGRATULATING CASH PATTEN AND BERKLEY 
WATERS 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, rodeo 
is not just a sport; it is a way of life 
and a heritage in the Lone Star State. 
I am pleased to see this time-honored 
tradition is being kept alive by the 
next generation of Texans. 
I rise today to recognize the accom-
plishments of two outstanding west 
Texans, 9-year-old Berkley Waters of 
Lubbock and 12-year-old Cash Patten 
of New Home. Berkley and Cash, two 
great cowboy names, recently com-
peted in the barrel racing finals in the 
Junior World Finals rodeo in Las 
Vegas. 
West Texans are known for being 
hardworking, tough, and undeterred. 
Cash and Berkley have these qualities, 
Mr. Speaker, in spades. Their commit-
ment to these virtues and their craft 
has allowed them to perform at the 
highest level and on the biggest stage 
in their sport. 
I want to congratulate Berkley and 
Cash for all their hard work and what 
they have been able to accomplish at a 
young age. 
God bless America and go west 
Texas. 
f 
HONORING SENATOR HARRY REID 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Nevada’s 
longest-serving Senator, Harry Reid, 
who passed away on December 28, with 
his beloved children: Lana, Key, Josh, 
Leif, and Rory; and his devoted wife of 
62 years, Landra, by his side. My con-
dolences and prayers are with them all 
and with the countless people whose 
lives he has changed, his friends, staff, 
and all of those in the great State of 
Nevada. 
This tribute could be about Senator 
Reid being the most consequential Sen-
ate majority leader in modern history. 
It could also be about how Senator 
Reid was the true embodiment of what 
it meant to be battle born, a boxer as 
a young man who never backed down 
from a good fight for the least among 
us. 
It could be about the story of his 
American Dream, rising out of severe 
poverty in Searchlight, Nevada; hitch-
hiking 40 miles to school; working as a 
Capitol Police Officer to put himself 
through law school, to becoming one of 
the most powerful political leaders of 
our time. 
It could also be about his legislative 
accomplishments, such as the Afford-
able Care Act, which gave millions of

Americans 
access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare, saving our economy during 
the Great Recession, taking on Wall 
Street, or making sure that Nevada 
would not become the Nation’s nuclear 
waste dumping ground. 
However, I want to focus on Senator 
Reid’s role in advancing women in poli-
tics. 
In Nevada, Senator Reid is known for 
his quiet yet sometimes curt de-
meanor; his incredible, strategic mind; 
and his work ethic beyond compare. 
He built a team, known as Team 
Reid, that has roots throughout this 
Capitol, 
throughout 
Nevada, 
and 
throughout this country, which will 
have an impact long beyond his life. 
There is no doubt that Senator Reid 
was a visionary when it came to poli-
tics. His vision in making sure that 
women had a runway into politics has 
left an indelible mark. 
Within his own legendary team, 
women occupied the most senior posts. 
At the same time, Senator Reid re-
cruited and mentored women up and 
down the ballot. It is no surprise, 
therefore, that Nevada became the first 
State to have a woman-majority State 
legislature. We have a woman-majority 
supreme court, as well as a woman-ma-
jority congressional delegation, with 
two female Senators, CORTEZ MASTO 
and ROSEN. 
Harry Reid’s devotion to Landra is 
legendary. Perhaps it was her enor-
mous role in his life and his utter re-
spect for her as a partner that seeded 
his unspoken yet strong commitment 
to women’s leadership. Maybe it was 
the role that his mother played, raising 
him out of extreme poverty in Search-
light, Nevada. Whatever the motiva-
tion, the results speak for themselves. 
Growing up in Searchlight, Harry 
Reid was given a nickname, Pinky. I 
am not sure what it referred to, and I 
actually don’t think he particularly 
liked it. But as Senator Reid lies in 
state in our Nation’s Capitol this week, 
this woman, who benefited from his 
mentorship and guidance, will believe 
that perhaps that nickname was a pre-
monition of his role in changing the 
face of leadership in Nevada and this 
country. 
We all know that Senator Reid was 
infamous for not saying goodbye. I my-
self was the recipient of that dial tone 
on many occasions. But those occa-
sions were because he never failed to 
pick up the phone when I called for ad-
vice. I will miss those phone calls, but 
I will take this opportunity to say 
goodbye to a man who showed how to 
fight for the little guy; a man who 
could take a punch and outwork any-
one; a man who led through example of 
compassion and strength. 
I say goodbye to Senator Reid and 
thank him. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I rise to recognize National Human 
Trafficking Day. This issue, the issue 
of human trafficking, is not a Repub-
lican or Democrat issue. It is an Amer-
ican issue. It is a human issue. 
That is why today I am proud to wear 
blue to show my support to all those 
fighting this terrible scourge and also 
to the victims of trafficking, to stand 
in solidarity as we fight for resources 
and support and also to educate fellow 
Members and citizens about this ter-
rible scourge. We need to be loud. 
Trafficking occurs in every State, in 
every district, and in every city, which 
is why every single Member here today 
needs to come together as we fight this 
modern-day slavery. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle as 
we work to strengthen resources for 
those on the front lines and continue 
to expose the awful scourge of modern- 
day slavery that we know as traf-
ficking. 
HONORING CORPORAL DUANE DEWEY 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of a 
remarkable American hero. Corporal 
Duane Dewey of the United States Ma-
rine Corps embodied what it meant to 
be an American soldier and patriot. 
A Bronze Star and Purple Heart re-
cipient, Corporal Dewey displayed cou-
rageous and meritorious actions during 
his service in the Korean war. Already 
riddled from shrapnel from a grenade, 
Corporal Dewey used his own body as a 
human shield and covered a grenade as 
it exploded. In doing so, he protected 
his fellow soldiers and showed true sac-
rifice in service. Miraculously, he sur-
vived. 
In 1953, President Eisenhower pre-
sented Corporal Dewey with the Medal 
of Honor and described his remarkable 
service as ‘‘indomitable courage, out-
standing initiative, and valiant efforts 
on behalf of others in the face of al-
most certain death reflect the highest 
credit upon Corporal Dewey.’’ 
Now, after 26 years serving in the 
Marine Corps Corporal Dewey retired 
and spent many winter seasons in my 
home county of Alachua. He was well 
known in the veteran community and 
throughout Florida for his incredible 
bravery during battle and as an exam-
ple of giving one’s all for their Nation, 
no questions asked. 
Mr. Dewey recently passed away 
after a long and distinguished life of 
service. His life will be remembered 
through the many people who had the 
honor of meeting and knowing Cor-
poral Dewey and through the Duane E. 
Dewey AMVETS Post 1988 of Baldwin, 
where many of his service records are 
on display. 
We will continue to thank today but 
also every day the brave men and 
women of the U.S. Armed Forces, like 
Corporal Dewey, for their service and 
sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. 
God bless Corporal Dewey. May he 
rest easy.

CONGRATULATING JEB SMITH 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to congratulate the newest president of 
the Florida Farm Bureau, Mr. Jeb 
Smith. Before his election to this posi-
tion, Mr. Smith served on the State 
board of the Florida Farm Bureau and 
on the Putnam-St. Johns County Farm 
Bureau board of directors. 
Jeb’s family has over a century of ex-
perience farming in Florida. Their cur-
rent cattle, hay, and sod operation in 
St. Johns County have been going 
strong for decades, and their operation 
will be recognized next year as a Cen-
tury Pioneer Family Farm. 
Mr. Smith started as a volunteer 
leader with the Florida Farm Bureau 
and, in the following decades, has been 
recognized as the Florida Farm Bureau 
Outstanding Young Farmer, among 
many other accolades. 
In addition to serving as the bureau’s 
president, Jeb is also a St. Johns Coun-
ty commissioner and a board member 
of the Rodeheaver Boys Ranch. He also 
founded the God’s Way Baptist Church 
in Hastings and has served as its pas-
tor. 
I am sure that his wife of 27 years, 
Wendy, and his four children are proud 
of his accomplishments. 
Congratulations to my friend, Presi-
dent Smith, on his election. I wish him 
the best as he leads the Florida Farm 
Bureau and the incredible people who 
continue to champion our farmers, 
ranchers, and producers in Florida. We 
wish Jeb the very best of luck and offer 
him our congratulations.

PASSING VOTING RIGHTS 
LEGISLATION IS ONLY OPTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
‘‘We the people of the United States, in 
order to form a more perfect union, es-
tablish justice, ensure domestic tran-
quility, provide for the common de-
fense, promote the general welfare, and 
secure the blessings of liberty to our-
selves and our posterity, do ordain and 
establish this Constitution for the 
United States of America.’’ 
Formulated by the people of the 
United States to create a more perfect 
union—we know these words. They are 
the core of our being. Our Nation of 
over 300 million people embraces diver-
sity and individualism, has birthed a 
citizenry that speaks many languages, 
holds a plethora of deep religious be-
liefs, or none, and practices customs 
and traditions originating on distant 
shores. 
We are unique. African Americans, in 
particular, have a unique history em-
bedded in slavery, discrimination, and 
the denial of our rights, but voting 
rights have been our refuge. 
Today I rise and say there is no op-
tion other than passing the John Rob-
ert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H15 
January 11, 2022 
Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. 
There is no option. We do not just sur-
vive; our Nation thrives because of our 
shared belief that helps us against all 
odds. It helped us in World War I and 
World War II and the conflicts in and 
around. It helps us in wars where we 
have lost our young men and women. 
We have a country formed out of 
many to become one people. Americans 
share the same compact that we are a 
nation of laws that flow from the most 
crucial and fundamental law, the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
The impact of the Constitution and 
its basic premise can be summarized by 
the simple belief that every individual 
is entitled to an equally valid vote. 
We saw in 2020 that fragile vote that 
saw the largest turnout in any Presi-
dential election in the history of the 
United States—that is a very long 
time—challenged from its very begin-
ning, challenged on the day of the elec-
tion, continued to be challenged and 
misrepresented and distorted, and elec-
tion officials attacked and intimidated, 
even removed from office. 
So I stand today on the shoulders not 
only of Dr. Martin Luther King, who I 
view, in fact, as a modern-day prophet; 
and our own colleague, John Robert 
Lewis; but I stand on the shoulders of 
a widow, Coretta Scott King, who I got 
to know in the aftermath of her hus-
band’s death. She worked without ceas-
ing to have his principles, his values, 
his understanding of the ‘‘beloved com-
munity’’ recognized and to continue 
the sense of the rightness and right-
eousness of voting. 
I had the privilege of working for the 
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference. It will always be a special part 
of my history. I had the privilege of 
working with individuals with names 
that we know, the young Hosea Wil-
liams, James Orange, some of the gen-
erals and foot soldiers that were in the 
army of Dr. Martin Luther King’s be-
loved America. 
Yes, I had the privilege—I call it 
that—of walking on plantations to try 
to register Black sharecroppers fright-
ened and intimidated, though dignified, 
to vote. Their intimidation was real be-
cause those who owned the general 
store or the plantation were not eager 
for those Blacks in the South to vote 
or for those Hispanics and others who 
worked, as Dr. King worked, with Cesar 
Chavez and the farmworkers. They 
were not eager for them to vote. 
Today, as we are about to watch as a 
step is to be made, both in terms of the 
speech of a President and Vice Presi-
dent but the actual vote in the Senate, 
we cannot isolate ourselves to focus on 
one or two persons. We really have to 
focus on who we are as a Nation, that 
this vote binds us together. It is the 
voice of the people. 
And the Constitution, it trumps any 
figment of our imagination that may 
consider something legitimate. The fil-
ibuster is not legitimate. It is a rule of 
one body of this Congress. It is a rule 
that we adhere to, as civil people do. 
We adhere to rules. We adhere to those 
in this House. I agree with that until a 
rule is used to trump and deny the 
basic constitutional values of the 14th 
Amendment and the Fifth Amendment 
of due process and equality, as it was 
utilized in the 20th century by segrega-
tionist Senators to deny civil rights 
laws. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important that I 
stand here today on Coretta’s name 
and Martin’s name and Bobby’s name 
and John’s name, that we must demand 
courage. To not vote for the Voting 
Rights Act is not an option. I will not 
allow that to happen because I will 
stand with every breath in my body to 
ensure that the American people can 
vote without intimidation, and they 
will be intimidated without the laws of 
the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act and as well the Free-
dom to Vote Act.

LISTENING TO CONCERNS OF 
KANSAS’ BIG FIRST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take the opportunity today to speak 
directly on behalf of my constituents 
and their concerns. 
Each year I make a point to host a 
townhall in all 63 counties of the Big 
First District because visiting with and 
listening to Kansans, who I have taken 
an oath to serve, is one of the greatest 
joys of my work as a Member of Con-
gress. 
So far in 2022, I have hosted seven of 
these townhalls. At each meeting, I 
heard the same concerns echoed: gov-
ernment 
spending, 
labor 
shortages, 
vaccine mandates, and the next farm 
bill. 
Kansans believe that government 
spending is out of control, and I agree 
with them. One of our country’s fastest 
growing expenses is just the interest 
payments on our national debt, which 
is estimated to be $562 billion for fiscal 
year 2021 alone. You could fund the en-
tire Department of Agriculture more 
than twice over for that amount. 
Given this situation, this administra-
tion’s spending, as we have seen in the 
bloated Build Back Better plan, is 
shortsighted and dangerous. Wild dis-
cretionary government spending has 
weakened our great country and, not 
only that, spending on some programs 
during the pandemic has incentivized 
staying at home instead of returning to 
work. 
Kansans believe that labor shortages 
are hurting Americans, and I agree 
with them. People can’t find bus driv-
ers to take their kids to school or sani-
tation workers to pick up their trash. 
Meanwhile, inflation is at a 40-year 
high; grocery store staples are up over 
12 
percent; 
and 
people’s 
essential 
goods, like car parts and refrigerators, 
are still stuck on cargo ships. We are in 
an economic crisis, and this adminis-
tration has yet to act meaningfully to 
combat the effects. 
Kansans believe that vaccine man-
dates are unconstitutional, and I agree 
with them. Anyone who wants to get a 
vaccine should be able to get one in 
this country, but it is not the Federal 
Government’s job to dictate personal 
healthcare choices of the American 
people. Vaccine mandates are a terrible 
idea for the present situation in this 
country, as they will only continue to 
strip the workforce of even more peo-
ple. 
Kansans are also worried about the 
next farm bill, particularly as it re-
lates to crop insurance and the Live-
stock Indemnity Program, and I share 
these concerns. The 2018 farm bill did 
not include any major changes to Fed-
eral crop insurance, which provides a 
robust and strong safety net for farm-
ers across the country. 
I also want to ensure that the Live-
stock Indemnity Program remains in-
tact, as it offered critical support to 
folks in my district after natural disas-
ters like the recent wildfires that we 
saw last month. 
Farmers and producers are rightfully 
concerned that the 2023 farm bill could 
see significant changes. However, given 
that fact, House Democrats have held 
zero farm bill implementation hearings 
so far. 
My goal is to do everything within 
my power for my constituents to en-
sure that no significant changes are 
made to reduce either of these essen-
tial components in the next farm bill. 
The new year, which has just begun, 
brings with it a hope for change and 
growth. If we have been dissatisfied 
with the course of our lives or that of 
our Nation, January ushers in a fresh 
start. It gives us an opportunity to ex-
amine ourselves and to reassess our 
goals and ambitions. Most of all, the 
new year reminds us of the greatest 
privileges we have, living in a free na-
tion where we have the right to life and 
to liberty and to pursue happiness as 
we see fit. 
As we begin the second year of the 
117th Congress, I want to reiterate my 
dedication to serving my constituents 
in the Big First. I am fighting to pre-
serve the foundation of our free Nation 
and to protect your values. 
Kansas is still the pilot light of free-
dom for America. As long as it con-
tinues to burn, I believe that our 
brightest days are yet to come. 
CREATING THE CONGRESSIONAL FFA CAUCUS 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today to invite all of my colleagues to 
join me and 30 other Representatives 
from both sides of the aisle in the 
newly formed Congressional FFA Cau-
cus. Representative PANETTA and I es-
tablished this caucus to serve as an in-
formal group dedicated to issues affect-
ing the next generation of agriculture 
leaders and students pursuing careers 
in agriculture, food, natural resources, 
and related sciences. 
As a past FFA chapter president 
from Quinter, Kansas, and a member of 
the House Agriculture Committee, I 
am dedicated to raising awareness

The National FFA Organization is a

REFLECTING ON DEMOCRATIC 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF PAST YEAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. MANNING) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, as Con-
gress reconvenes for the Second Ses-
sion of the 117th Congress, I want to 
take a moment to reflect on the impor-
tant achievements that the Democrats 
have made this past year. 
The pandemic continues to be a chal-
lenge, but thanks to the funding pro-
vided by the Democrats’ American Res-
cue Plan Act, the vast majority of 
Americans have been vaccinated and 
are protected from severe illness, hos-
pitalization, and death. 
We must also acknowledge that the 
Democrats’ commitment to building 
back stronger and more equitably than 
before has resulted in unprecedented 
economic recovery from the initial im-
pact of the pandemic. 
Last month, the unemployment rate 
fell to 3.9 percent, the largest calendar- 
year decrease in the unemployment 
rate in history. We reached this rate 5 
years before experts anticipated. That 
is the result of adding 6.4 million jobs 
to the economy since President Biden 
took office, regaining 84 percent of the 
jobs lost during the pandemic. 
This economic boom was brought to 
you by President Biden and the Demo-
crats in Congress who voted for the 
American Rescue Plan. 
The American Rescue Plan super-
charged our economic recovery by pro-
viding critical support to small busi-
nesses as they navigated the pandemic. 
It expanded the child tax credit, which 
helped families put food on the table 
and pay for childcare. It provided rent 
assistance so families could keep their 
housing. 
Now, the bipartisan infrastructure 
law is creating millions of good-paying 
jobs while rebuilding our Nation’s 
crumbling 
infrastructure 
and 
com-
bating the climate crisis. 
Through the American Rescue Plan 
and the bipartisan Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, Democrats 
have delivered for the American people 
and created historic economic growth. 
We have more important work to do. 
We must encourage the Senate to pass 
the voting rights protections that we 
in the House passed months ago that 
are critical to ensure that all citizens 
can exercise their most precious right 
to vote. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to continue our important 
work, building back stronger and more 
equitably than ever before.

RECOGNIZING TAYLORVILLE JUN-
IOR 
HIGH 
SCHOOL’S 
SEVENTH 
GRADE 
GIRLS’ 
BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
hometown 
Taylorville 
Junior 
High 
School’s seventh grade girls’ basket-
ball team on their 2021 State cham-
pionship win. 
After a back and forth game, the 
score was tied at 16–16 with 4 seconds 
to go. The Tornadoes came out trium-
phant after Grace Rogers hit a clutch 
shot. 
The seventh grade girls’ basketball 
team ends their season with an overall 
record of 26–2. This team’s hard work, 
dedication, and sportsmanship shine 
throughout our entire Taylorville com-
munity. 
I give a big tip of the hat and person-
ally congratulate my good friend and 
head coach, Doug Bowsher. I congratu-
late all the girls on this wonderful, 
championship team for their hard work 
and dedication, and I am excited to see 
what the future holds for this cham-
pionship Taylorville Tornado team. 
CONGRATULATING DAVID BROWN 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
my good friend David Brown for his re-
tirement after more than 30 years at 
WAND in Decatur, Illinois. 
David’s ancestors moved from New 
Hampshire to Illinois in 1867 in a 
search for new farming opportunities. 
David is a centennial farmer, and his 
son is the sixth generation from his 
family to farm in central Illinois. After 
graduating from Millikin University, 
David also worked at WSOY radio. 
David first joined the WAND news 
team as an ag reporter when the Farm 
Progress Show came to central Illinois 
in 1991. At WAND, many of his col-
leagues described him as a mentor, a 
friend, and one of the hardest workers 
they have come to know. 
Throughout David’s tenure at the 
station, he was loved by all and re-
ceived an award for Media Excellence 
in Agriculture. According to David, he 
had the best of both worlds, working at 
his passion, and then getting to share 
the importance of agriculture with the 
viewers as a farmer and as an ag broad-
caster. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate David on 
his retirement. It is well deserved. Now 
David has a little more time to spend 
with his four children and six grand-
children. 
RECOGNIZING RAY AND BARBIE SWINDA 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize De-
catur residents Ray and Barbie Swinda 
and their Facebook page, Support De-
catur IL Business. 
Ray his wife, Barbie, have been using 
their Facebook page to show off local 
Decatur businesses and restaurants 
they have been enjoying, and encour-
aging others in the community to fol-
low their lead in buying and eating 
local. 
Ray and his wife started their page in 
response to larger chains harming the 
diversity of options for food and serv-
ices in the Decatur area that Ray re-
members existing as a kid. Many of the 
businesses that have been featured on 
their page have been shocked by the in-
crease in traffic. Ray and Barbie have 
received responses from others in the 
community, 
including 
Mayor 
Julie 
Moore Wolfe herself, and have become 
local leaders simply through their 
work in promoting local businesses and 
restaurants. 
I urge everybody, if you are traveling 
through Decatur, Illinois, and you 
want a good recommendation, go visit 
Ray and Barbie’s Facebook page, and 
you will see some great plates of deli-
cious food. 
I also personally congratulate Ray 
and Barbie on the success of their 
Facebook page and thank them for 
being pillars of the community and en-
couraging so many others to invest in 
our local businesses.

CONGRATULATING THE GEORGIA 
BULLDOGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate as a proud 
alumnus of the recently crowned 2022 
College Football National Champions, 
the Georgia Bulldogs. 
Going 12–1 on the season, the Georgia 
Bulldogs came into Indianapolis to face 
the Alabama Crimson Tide. 
In true heavyweight fashion, the 
grudge match opened as a hard-nosed 
defensive battle without one touch-
down being scored in the first half of 
play. 
The Dogs came out down in the sec-
ond half and captained by head coach, 
Kirby Smart, Georgia was able to score 
the first touchdown to take the lead. 
With a defense championed by the 
likes of Jordan Davis and Nakobe 
Dean, the Bulldogs managed to hold 
Alabama to one touchdown all game. 
Quarterback Stetson Bennet, who by 
the way is from Blackshear in Pierce 
County in the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia that I have the honor 
and privilege of representing, quarter-
back Stetson Bennett completed his 
Cinderella-story season, stepping up 
when it mattered most. 
With an interception returned for a 
touchdown to seal the deal, the Univer-
sity of Georgia was victorious.

January 11, 2022 
It has been four decades and some 
change since the University of Georgia 
brought a national title home to Ath-
ens, and I am so excited to see it fi-
nally happen. 
I was especially excited to see several 
players from the First District, the 
aforementioned 
Stetson 
Bennett, 
Nolan Smith from Savannah, and Jack

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF CHARLEY 
TRIPPI 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the mo-
mentous 100th birthday of the Georgia 
Bulldog legend, Charley Trippi. 
Charley is a fixture in Dawg Nation 
and the football community. 
A member of both the college foot-
ball and pro football Hall of Fame, 
Charley was a dual athlete at the Uni-
versity of Georgia, playing both base-
ball and football in 1942, 1945, and 1946. 
While in college, Charley played half-
back and quarterback and received the 
Maxwell Award given to the Nation’s 
top all-around player. 
Charley was also honored as a unani-
mous All-American SEC player of the 
year and as a two-time All-SEC player. 
In 1942, Charley helped lead the Geor-
gia Bulldogs to their first national 
championship. 
Selected as the first pick in the first 
round by the Chicago Cardinals in the 
NFL draft, Charley continued to have 
an illustrious career in the pros. 
The Cardinals organization inducted 
Charley into the Arizona Cardinals 
Ring of Honor following his time in the 
NFL. 
We are so happy and excited that 
Charley has reached this milestone. 
Happy birthday, Charley. 
CONGRATULATING THE BENEDICTINE CADETS 
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the 
Benedictine Cadets High School foot-
ball team for winning the 2021 Georgia 
4A State title. 
Winning football games in Georgia, 
where 
the 
sport 
practically 
runs 
through our veins, is hard. But winning 
the State title requires exceptional 
grit, determination, and perseverance. 
After the Benedictine Cadets suffered 
a 
loss 
in 
the 
2020 
State 
playoff 
semifinals, they entered the 2021 season 
with one goal: Winning a State title. 
Benedictine has consistently exhib-
ited drive, dedication, and the winner’s 
mentality. 
Head coach Danny Britt has tire-
lessly worked to lead this team to a 
State title, and their work has finally 
paid off. 
The Georgia 4A State title included 
Division 1 talent on both sides and was 
a battle from the beginning. Winning 
by only a touchdown, it truly was a 
game for the ages. 
We here in the First District of Geor-
gia are so proud of the Benedictine Ca-
dets and all that they have accom-
plished and will accomplish. 
Let’s do it again next year. 
f 
OREGONIANS HAVE A RIGHT TO 
KNOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in opposition to S. 192, the so-called 
River Democracy Act. 
This bill, contrary to what the title 
implies, has nothing to do with democ-
racy. 
Instead, it would, if passed, label 
some 4,700 miles of Oregon’s rivers, 
creeks, and streams as ‘‘wild and sce-
nic.’’ A more appropriate phrase would 
be just waiting to be burned and ru-
ined. 
However, this is not your typical 
wild and scenic river bill. This bill 
would designate a mile-wide corridor 
running the length of every inch of 
those 4,700 miles of waterways as wild 
and scenic. This mile is double the 
half-mile-wide corridor normal for such 
designations. This means that under 
this act, 4,700 square miles—an area 
about the size of Connecticut—would 
be locked up and left to the high prob-
ability of burning up. 
Many of the miles of streams, creeks, 
and gullies to which the bill would 
apply are within the 20 counties mak-
ing up my district. Many of those miles 
run through Oregon’s most important 
watersheds, which are absolutely es-
sential to the life of my communities, 
particularly in times of drought. Given 
the damaging impact of such designa-
tions to activities necessary to protect 
these streams, it is no wonder this bill 
is deeply unpopular, something that 
has been made crystal clear to me by 
the overwhelming majority of my 62 
county commissioners. They have seri-
ous and unanswered concerns about the 
dangers the act presents. 
Chief among them is that this des-
ignation will prevent what needs to be 
done to protect these watersheds, plac-
ing them in a bureaucratic wasteland 
where it will take years, if not decades, 
to initiate and then complete plans 
which may or may not allow the treat-
ment activities needed right now. 
Also, a top-down approach to land 
management is wrong because it com-
pletely ignores the interests of well-in-
formed local people, businesses, and 
stakeholders. 
The approach the bill’s sponsors used 
in developing this bill was seriously 
flawed because the river and stream 
nominations were solicited from var-
ious groups and the general public 
without any clear legal or scientific 
analysis 
to 
identify 
those 
rivers, 
streams, and creeks that would qualify 
as scenic. If a scientific or legal anal-
ysis exists, the sponsors should share 
it. 
Additionally, the public deserves to 
know which special interest groups 
crafted the bill, provided the unofficial 
maps of the streams affected, and con-
ducted the outreach to the public. 
It is absolutely clear, whatever the 
process was, that local stakeholders, 
elected 
officials, 
county 
commis-
sioners, landowners, users, and experts 
should have been consulted, and they 
were not. 
Let me explain why so many who 
truly want to protect our public lands 
are so outraged by this bill. 
So far this year, over half a million 
acres of forests and other lands have 
burned up in my district. Last year it 
was even worse with over a million 
acres laid to waste by fire. 
Inexplicably, the bill focuses upon 
only one method of protecting this 
4,700-square-mile proposed area from 
fire, and that is by what are called 
‘‘prescribed burns.’’ I cannot emphasize 
how dangerous it is to prescribe pre-
scribed burns in overgrown, densely 
packed, dry forests without thinning 
the forest first. Prescribed burning be-
fore thinning puts at extreme risk the 
very rivers and watersheds this des-
ignation is supposed to protect. It is 
like dropping a match in a tinderbox. 
It is impossible to contain these types 
of fires once they start. 
The River Democracy Act, if passed, 
would 
threaten 
watersheds, 
homes, 
businesses, 
ranches, 
livestock, 
and 
most importantly, human lives. 
The bill contains provisions through-
out that leave the door wide open for 
frivolous litigation by far-left special 
interest groups, who have profited for 
years from lucrative sue-and-settle 
tactics. 
The bill contains no explicit protec-
tions for the current multiple uses of 
the land, including sustainable timber 
harvests, hunting, grazing, fishing, and 
mining. 
Regardless of legislative intent, the 
applicable agencies will have broad au-
thorities to restrict these activities. 
To date, no official maps have been 
provided. Oregonians need to have ac-
cess to clear official maps to see just 
how much land is affected by this bill. 
I believe no further action should be 
taken with regard to this bill until the 
questions I have raised today and nec-
essary maps are made available to the 
public so that Oregonians know exactly 
what this bill would do.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF JANICE GALLA-
GHER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life and legacy of 
an extraordinary person, Mrs. Janice 
Gallagher, who our community trag-
ically lost. 
Born in Philadelphia, Janice was a 
lifelong resident of Bensalem and was a 
proud graduate of Archbishop Ryan 
High School and Holy Family Univer-
sity.

Janice worked at her family’s farm 
market, D-G’s Farm Market, for over 
30 years. Janice went on to own and op-
erate her own market, J&M Deli and 
Produce for many more years. Janice 
spent the last 5 years, Mr. Speaker, 
working at the Bensalem Police De-
partment, a phenomenal organization 
of tremendously courageous women 
and men where she was widely re-
spected by our law enforcement com-
munity throughout Bucks County. 
A longtime volunteer of St. Ephrem 
Catholic Church, Janice will always be 
remembered for her kind and giving 
spirit. 
I send my deepest condolences to 
Janice’s beloved husband of 45 years, 
District Judge Mike Gallagher, her 
son, her siblings, and all who knew and 
loved her. I know I speak for our entire 
community when I say that we are all 
grateful for Janice’s contributions dur-
ing her incredible 66 years of life on 
this planet. 
Mr. Speaker, may the spirit of her 
generosity and service continue to in-
spire everybody in our community and 
everybody in this Chamber.

NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS 
DAY 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, 
today is National Human Trafficking 
Awareness Day, and I rise in support of 
the more than 40 million men, women, 
and children, who are victims of this 
global tragedy. 
Human trafficking is a $150 billion 
criminal industry that exploits vulner-
able individuals and strips them of 
their fundamental human rights. 
Mr. Speaker, while this criminal con-
duct may seem a world away, it is very 
often taking place right in our own 
backyards. Human trafficking is re-
ported in cities, suburbs, and rural 
areas in all 50 States in this Nation. 
Last year alone, the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline reported 221 cases 
of human trafficking in my home State 
of Pennsylvania and more than 10,000 
cases nationwide. 
These staggering and horrific num-
bers underscore the need for increased 
victim support services, education and 
awareness, and legislative advocacy 
surrounding human trafficking. 
On this National Human Trafficking 
Awareness Day, let us renew our com-
mitment to the global fight to end this 
abhorrent crime against humanity and 
redouble our efforts for the millions of 
survivors and their victims.

VOTING FALSEHOODS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my sincere concern 
for 
the 
falsehoods 
Democrats 
are 
spreading across the country regarding 
Americans’ ability to vote. 
Over the last year, Democrats have 
repeatedly alleged that the 2020 elec-
tion was the most secure election in 
American history, bludgeoning any dis-
sent or legitimate election integrity 
concerns as ‘‘the big lie.’’ 
Yet in the same breath, the left has 
also spent the last year championing 
an election reform bill, the so-called 
For the People Act, that aims to fed-
eralize our elections processes, ban 
voter ID, and fund incumbent cam-
paigns with Americans’ hard-earned 
tax dollars—in the name of improving 
election security. 
In fact, the Senate Democrats are at-
tempting to destroy 200 years of prece-
dent by removing the filibuster to so-
lidify Democrat control of elections, 
thinly veiled as election reform. 
But why is it necessary for the Fed-
eral Government to take over our elec-
tions process—a role specifically des-
ignated to the States by our Founding 
Fathers—if that process is working 
soundly and securely? 
You see, Democrats are willing to 
put political gains above morality in 
order to quench their ever-longing 
thirst for power. This is a perfect ex-
ample of ‘‘the ends justify the means.’’ 
And that is wrong. 
It is really quite simple: Republicans 
want to make it easier to vote, but 
harder to cheat. We should all want 
that. But no, Democrats are tena-
ciously gearing up to destroy our Re-
public as we know it by making it easi-
er to cheat. 
Take my home State of Georgia. 
Today, the Vice President and the 
President will travel to Atlanta to 
spread more misinformation about vot-
ing rights as an attempt to pressure 
the Senate to eliminate the filibuster. 
Yet, Biden will conveniently leave sev-
eral facts out of his remarks: 
He will refuse to admit that before 
this year his home State of Delaware 
denied voters in-person early voting, 
and now only requires 10 days of early 
voting—less than Georgia’s minimum 
of 17. 
Why? Because this reality flies in the 
face of Biden’s false narrative that our 
democracy is under attack by Repub-
lican efforts. This is more hypocrisy. 
He will fail to mention that just last 
week, Georgia finally launched an in-
vestigation into alleged illegal ballot 
harvesting in the 2020 election. 
Why? Because this truth does not 
support Biden’s vilification of Repub-
licans that raise concerns about the 
2020 election. 
He will ignore the fact that New 
York is attempting to grant more than 
800,000 noncitizens the right to vote in 
municipal elections. 
Why? Because Biden is willing to 
overlook illogical and dangerous solu-
tions to obtain control over Americans’ 
lives. Instead, he will comically claim 
that many Republican States, includ-
ing Georgia, are attempting to dis-
enfranchise Americans when in fact 
their State voting laws strengthen 
election integrity to ensure every soli-
tary American has free, fair, and hon-
est elections. One citizen, one vote. 
I firmly reject Democrats’ dangerous 
and deceptive ploy to centralize elec-
tions in Washington. It is wrong for 
Americans. It is wrong for election se-
curity. And it is wrong for the future of 
our Republic. 
CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA’S 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAM 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the 2022 College 
Football Playoff National Champions, 
my alma mater, the University of 
Georgia. 
During a thrilling game last night, 
the Bulldogs defeated the University of 
Alabama 33 to 18. This exciting win 
marks the first time the University of 
Georgia will bring home the College 
Football Playoff national champion-
ship trophy to Athens and our second 
national championship trophy in the 
history of Georgia Collegiate Football. 
What a triumphant ending to an excep-
tional season. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
talented 
young men that put their all into the 
game, and to head coach, Kirby Smart, 
and the coaching staff for leading the 
Dawgs to a monumental win. May God 
bless the great State of Georgia as we 
now hail two champions from the 2021 
season—the Atlanta Braves and the 
Georgia Bulldogs. 
Go Dawgs. Soli Deo Gloria. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF RANDY 
POTTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, in life 
there are names that once spoken give 
rise to great emotion. The name 
‘‘Randy Potter’’ is one of those names 
in our community. 
Today, I recognize the life of one of 
Upstate New York’s most colorful and 
original 
characters, 
Randy 
Potter. 
Simply mentioning Randy’s name puts 
smiles on the faces of all who knew 
him. Seeing his crazy hair and fun at-
tire always covered in campaign slo-
gans and buttons put a smile on the 
faces of people who didn’t know him. 
Randy was a music aficionado and a 
diehard Grateful Dead fan who at-
tended hundreds of concerts, and he 
will always be fondly remembered for 
his love of music. He also enjoyed 
sports, and it didn’t matter which team 
was playing; as long as it was a New 
York team, Randy was always their 
biggest fan. 
Perhaps most importantly to Randy, 
he was someone who cared a lot about 
our community and about politics and 
the importance of government, and our 
community depended on him to get the 
message out. 
Sadly, Mr. Potter passed away quiet-
ly on the evening of December 23. A 
treasure trove of stories, jokes, and the 
smiles of many, many residents across

Upstate and Central New York will be 
remembered by our loss of Randy Pot-
ter. Today, we remember his life and 
the many moments of joy he shared 
throughout our community. May we all 
learn a lesson from his life and zest for 
sparking joy and laughter in those 
around him. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JOE FUSCO, JR. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the tragic passing of 
one of my district’s great public serv-
ants, the Honorable Joseph Fusco, Jr., 
the former mayor of Rome, New York. 
Mayor Fusco was a dedicated public 
servant, who led an incredible life. He 
first served as Rome City councilman 
and then as the 42nd mayor of Rome 
from 2011 to 2015, a job he performed 
with integrity, passion, and determina-
tion. 
Joe led by example. He was always a 
smiling face and a helping hand. He 
oversaw the completion of the Mohawk 
River Trail, and in what little spare 
time he had, would participate in vol-
unteer work across the community. He 
also hosted a terrific charity motor-
cycle ride across our beautiful region, 
an event I always looked forward to 
participating in each year. His dedica-
tion 
to 
public 
service 
carries 
on 
through his son, Joseph, III, who be-
came a Rome firefighter in 2007. 
I have no doubt that Rome, New 
York, is a better place because of the 
legacy of Mayor Fusco and the legacy 
that he leaves behind. I also extend my 
deepest condolences to Mayor Fusco’s 
family, as they are grieving deeply at 
this time. This includes his beloved 
wife and dear friend, Laurie, his son, 
Joe, and many grandchildren. He will 
be greatly missed by many. Again, his 
legacy will not be forgotten. 
RECOGNIZING PRISCILLA ‘‘PEEP’’ WILLIAMS FOR 
HER ATHLETIC AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Priscilla, also 
known as Peep, Williams, a standout 
athlete and student from New York’s 
22nd District. 
As an 8th grader in 2017, Peep was 
named to the Fellowship of Christian 
Athletes Lacrosse Girls National Mid-
dle School Team. From there, the hon-
ors just keep pouring in. 
As a freshman in the spring of 2019, 
Peep stormed into the Seton Academy 
lacrosse scene, breaking the school’s 
individual scoring record that was pre-
viously held by Seton’s first Naval 
Academy appointee, who also happened 
to be her big sister, Maddie, who I had 
the distinguished honor of recom-
mending an appointment to the U.S. 
Naval Academy. 
Peep is a 2021 USA Lacrosse Aca-
demic All-American and a member of 
the U–18 National Team. In this year’s 
off season, Peep also won the New York 
State Sectional Tennis Championship. 
Ms. Williams recently signed her letter 
of intent to travel nearly 3,000 miles 
from home where she will play for an 
institution with a standard of excel-
lence in both athletics and academics, 
the Stanford Cardinals. 
Please join me in congratulating 
Peep and wishing her all the best in her 
future endeavors and know she will 
continue to represent our community 
with grace and determination. I wish 
the best to her parents, wonderful 
members of our community as well.

RECOGNIZING DR. HAROLD BLACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my dear friend, Dr. 
Harold Black. The University of Geor-
gia, his alma mater, recently an-
nounced it will name a new residence 
hall in his honor. 
He was the first Black student to en-
roll in the university’s Terry College of 
Business, graduating with a bachelor of 
business administration in economics. 
He completed his education by earning 
his master of the arts and Ph.D. in eco-
nomics from Ohio State University. 
Dr. Black then led an accomplished 
career working for financial institu-
tions. He served as Deputy Director of 
the Department of Economic Research 
and Analysis in the United States Of-
fice of the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, Director and Chairman of the 
Nashville branch of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Atlanta, and consulted 
for several major banking corpora-
tions. 
Dr. Black later used his public and 
private sector experience to teach fi-
nance in the higher education system. 
Following tenures at several univer-
sities, Dr. Black eventually settled at 
my alma mater, the University of Ten-
nessee in Knoxville. 
Dr. Black shared his knowledge with 
students in the Haslam College of Busi-
ness for 24 years until his retirement in 
2011. Throughout his career, Dr. Black 
published his financial research in out-
lets like the American Economic Re-
view, the Journal of Banking and Fi-
nance, and the Journal of Monetary 
Economics. He received many awards 
for his teaching and research. Dr. 
Black continues to write, publishing a 
weekly column in my favorite news-
paper, the Knoxville Focus. 
Congratulations on your recent rec-
ognition from the University of Geor-
gia, Dr. Black. Our community is proud 
of your achievements, and I for one 
enjoy reading your views on economics, 
and for making it so even a person of 
my intelligence level can understand 
what you are saying. I really appre-
ciate it. 
HONORING PETTY OFFICER SECOND CLASS CHRIS 
AL-BRETT 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor Petty Officer Second Class 
Chris Al-Brett as Tennessee’s Second 
District’s Veteran of the Month. 
Chris enrolled in avionics school at 
the Naval Air Technical Training Cen-
ter in Millington, Tennessee, in 1969. 
Later that year, he reported to Attack 
Squadron 174 based at Naval Air Sta-
tion Cecil Field, which defended the 
beaches of Northeast Florida against a 
potential communist invasion. 
He worked on an A–7 Corsair 2 Light 
Attack Bomber. Chris later transferred 
to Attack Squadron 176 in Virginia. In 
1972, he embarked aboard the aircraft 
carrier USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
for a mission in the Mediterranean Sea. 
After serving overseas, Chris was hon-
orably discharged from the U.S. Navy 
in 1974. 
In 2015, Chris joined the Captain Bill 
Robinson Chapter 1078 of the Vietnam 
Veterans of America. He became the 
chapter’s public information officer, 
and the chapter received the Vietnam 
Veterans of America’s 2017 Chapter of 
the Year award thanks in part to his 
leadership. 
In December 2020, Chris joined the 
United Veterans Council of East Ten-
nessee’s Board of Directors as its pub-
lic information officer. He was recently 
elected as the board’s president, a posi-
tion he will assume this year. 
Mr. Speaker, we thank Chris for his 
service to our country and to his fellow 
veterans. I wish him the very best at 
the start of his new position.

COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
AND 
ONLINE 
SEXUAL 
EXPLOI-
TATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today is 
National Human Trafficking Aware-
ness Day, and I rise to bring attention 
to the horrific increase in human traf-
ficking and online sexual exploitation. 
Since the pandemic began, traf-
ficking and sexual exploitation have 
skyrocketed in my own home State of 
Missouri and across the United States 
of America and the world. 
I have made it a priority to support 
survivors and hold websites account-
able for facilitating sex trafficking. 
I am proud to be the only Member of 
Congress in over 20 years to success-
fully amend section 230 of the Commu-
nications Decency Act with my bill, 
the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, 
or FOSTA. 
In the coming weeks, Mr. Speaker, I 
will introduce multiple pieces of legis-
lation to combat human trafficking, 
child sexual exploitation, and online 
sexual exploitation. 
We must come together to eliminate 
this barbaric trade.

Whether we explore the skies or reside

May we find ourselves this day to be

If we travel to far-flung places or find

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed bills of the fol-
lowing titles in which the concurrence 
of the House is requested: 
S. 450. An act to award posthumously the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Emmett Till 
and Mamie Till-Mobley. 
S. 3451. An act to include certain com-
puter-related projects in the Federal permit-
ting program under title XLI of the FAST 
Act, and for other purposes. 
f 
THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, last 
week a fire in Philadelphia killed 12 
people, including 8 children. While our 
city mourned, just days later, a fire in 
New York killed 17, including 8 chil-
dren. 
These two events have at least three 
things in common: a high loss of life, 
an extraordinary number of children 
killed, all in public housing over-
crowded with families who cannot af-
ford to move. 
Too many families are in this posi-
tion because of our Nation’s housing 
crisis. We say we need affordable hous-
ing, so let me speak plainly. We need 
more housing, affordable public and 
private housing, that families with low 
income can actually afford. 
In the Philadelphia area, there are 
tens of thousands of people on waiting 
lists that are nearly a decade closed or 
years long. 
We in Congress have a role to play. In 
the Build Back Better Act is $150 bil-
lion to repair and restore existing 
housing and to build more public and 
affordable private housing. That will be 
a powerful start. 
As the Senate stalls, more families 
are in danger. It is time this House, 
and their house, helps others find 
theirs. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TROOPER 
JOHN HORTON 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Trooper John 
Horton of the North Carolina Highway 
Patrol. On January 3, he passed away 
in a tragic accident in the line of duty. 
He was a 15-year veteran of the unit 
and was assigned to Rutherford Coun-
ty. 
His two younger siblings, James and 
Joe, served alongside him at one point 
in the Highway Patrol. They were the 
first and only trio of siblings to ever 
work simultaneously in the Highway 
Patrol in North Carolina’s history. 
My prayers go out to Trooper Hor-
ton’s family, his wife, and six children. 
May his memory and service to his 
community serve as an inspiration for 
future generations of law enforcement 
officers to come. 
f 
KEEPING HOMES SAFE AND WARM 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, temperatures this week in 
Buffalo and western New York are in 
single digits. 
My community has some of the old-
est housing stock in the country. Keep-
ing these homes safe and warm is ex-
pensive. Failing to do so can be life 
threatening. 
This year, Congress approved $876 
million in additional Home Energy As-
sistance Program funding for seniors 
and families in New York to afford en-
ergy. The infrastructure bill goes fur-
ther, providing a historic $3.5 billion 
nationwide for weatherization. This 
funding means that old houses will bet-
ter withstand extreme weather as well 
as supporting green energy jobs. 
But we can’t stop there. We must do 
more. This Congress must enact the re-
newable energy provisions in Build 
Back Better so entire neighborhoods in 
my community can be retrofitted for 
long-term resilience. I urge the Senate 
to enact these provisions now. 
f 
HONORING AGNES TURK’S 108TH 
BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Agnes Turk, a con-
stituent from the great Eighth District 
of Minnesota, who is celebrating her 
108th birthday this week. 
Born in Pennsylvania, Agnes soon 
after moved to the Twin Ports area and 
has lived there ever since. 
As a young woman, Agnes valued her 
education so much that she walked 2 
miles to school every day, rain or 
snow. She later went to business 
school, showing the spirit of hard work 
instilled in her. 
Since the 1930s, Agnes has lived a 
beautiful life in Duluth, Minnesota, 
where she and her husband, John, 
raised three boys. 
While John worked for U.S. Steel and 
the family operated a theater and an 
oil service station together, they hap-
pily lived out their American Dream. 
Additionally, Agnes is a dedicated 
mother; a patriotic citizen, who has 
never missed voting in an election; and 
a faithful churchgoer. 
She has touched the lives of so many 
people in the Northland, and her im-
pact on Duluth will always be remem-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H21 
January 11, 2022 
Born on October 10, 1941, in Memphis, 
Tennessee, Berry spent most of his 
childhood in Toledo, Ohio. In 1964, the 
Denver Broncos took him out of the 
University of Findlay in the 19th round 
of the American Football League draft. 
Barry, a very talented and standout 
sprinter, opted for pro football over a 
chance to join the U.S. Olympic team, 
and he played a couple of seasons with 
the Broncos. 
Once his football career concluded, 
Barry began his career in public and 
community service, first as the City of 
Northglenn recreation director and 
then as the owner of Colorado’s first 
full-service Dairy Queen in the early 
1970s. From 1972 to ’79, Barry served on 
the Northglenn City Council and then 
he became mayor. Along the way, he 
took pride in organizing the Multiple 
Sclerosis Dinner of Champions for 
many years and running Northglenn’s 
football camp. Other highlights include 
his membership in the Colorado Base-
ball Commission in the early 1990s, 
which helped pave the way for the 
Rockies. 
Barry was a devoted husband to 
Glenda, a loving father of two, and he 
loved spending time with his grand-
children. I am deeply grateful for his 
lifetime of service to our community 
and the great State of Colorado, and I 
personally will miss him.

RECOGNIZING KOREAN AMERICAN 
DAY 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, Janu-
ary 13 is Korean American Day, a day 
to recognize the countless contribu-
tions of Korean Americans and cele-
brate the arrival of the first Korean 
immigrants to the United States in 
1903. 
As one of the first Korean-American 
women to ever serve in Congress, this 
day is very special to me. I was just 19 
years old when I came to America, and 
I achieved what I never thought was 
possible, to serve this country as a 
Member of Congress. 
So many Korean-Americans like me 
came to this country with the hope of 
achieving their own American Dream. 
We must work together to inspire and 
support the next generation of Korean- 
American leaders. 
Today, we celebrate the vibrant com-
munity of Korean-Americans in the 
United States and all that they have 
worked to achieve. 
Happy Korean American Day. 
f 
NEED FOR EXPANDED COVID–19 
TESTING 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to discuss the surge in the coronavirus 
cases that Americans are struggling 
with. Part of that is the access to 
COVID tests. Many are waiting in long 
lines to get PCR tests and 2 to 3 days 
to receive their results. We should and 
can do better. 
Households cannot find rapid tests in 
stores and wait weeks in line for online 
orders. 
In Fresno County, which I represent, 
the demand for testing has increased 30 
percent in the last several weeks. 
We must expand testing. I call on the 
administration to prioritize our testing 
systems. Access to testing and timely 
results are critical to determine if 
someone is infected with COVID–19 and 
enables them to take steps to avoid 
spreading it to others. It is that sim-
ple. 
It is vital that every American has 
access to the rapid test at no cost. It is 
critical for our economic recovery. 
At this stage, no one should have to 
wait long hours or pay a single dime 
for same-day results. We can and we 
should do better. 
We are not out of the woods yet. We 
can end this pandemic through robust 
testing and getting vaccinated. That is 
what we must do.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARY 
HAYNES 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor the life of former Peoria City 
Clerk Mary Haynes, who passed away 
at the end of 2021. Mary Haynes rep-
resented the best of Peoria. 
In 1985, Mary was elected as the first 
woman Peoria city clerk. For over 25 
years, she made local government work 
better. Being the city clerk was a pas-
sion of Mary’s, and she was beloved by 
her colleagues. She ensured trans-
parency 
in 
city 
government 
and 
worked to educate other city clerks 
throughout Illinois. 
One of her most satisfying roles dur-
ing her time as clerk was heading up 
the Rediscovering City Hall project, 
which restored Peoria City Hall to its 
monument form. 
Above all, Mary was a devoted moth-
er and grandmother and one of the 
kindest people you could meet. She was 
a friend to everyone who knew her, and 
her presence will be missed dearly in 
Peoria. 
My prayers are with Mary’s children, 
grandchildren, and loved ones. May she 
rest in peace.

SURGING INFLATION DEVASTATES 
FAMILIES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on Friday, I com-
pleted an annual districtwide legisla-
tive agenda media tour. The issue of 
greatest concern was inflation affect-
ing everyday people and gas up 61 per-
cent. 
Bidenflation has surged to a 40-year 
high. It is clear that $4.5 trillion spend-
ing bills devastate pocketbooks. Even a 
recent analysis from the Federal Re-
serve of San Francisco agrees that the 
relief package has impacted inflation. 
Sadly, only 17 percent of workers 
have received raises that have kept up 
with inflation, according to the Demo-
crat New York Times. 
The Democrat elite think they are 
smarter than everyone and think Dem-
ocrat voters and Democrat media are 
ignorant to believe that trillion-dollar 
spending bills cost zero dollars. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism, 
as it continues moving from the Af-
ghanistan safe haven to America. 
Congratulations 
to 
Congressman 
MIKE WALTZ and Dr. Julia Nesheiwat 
on the birth on January 7 of Arman 
‘‘Armie’’ Waltz.

HONORING 
DUBUQUE 
POLICE 
CHIEF MARK DALSING UPON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize retired Dubuque Po-
lice Chief Mark Dalsing. He retired 
after 32 years of service to the city of 
Dubuque, Iowa. 
Chief Dalsing is an absolute pillar in 
the community of Dubuque because of 
his devotion to protecting his commu-
nity. He built a phenomenal legacy of 
successfully incorporating community 
engagement into law enforcement. 
While serving as Dubuque’s police 
chief, he instilled a passion for public 
service into his team of officers, bring-
ing community engagement to the 
forefront of their work. 
Chief Dalsing’s years of service are a 
testament to the love that he has for 
his fellow Iowans and the compassion 
he led with. 
I wish Chief Mark Dalsing and his 
family all the best in this exciting new 
chapter of life and thank him for his 
selfless service and dedication to the 
city of Dubuque for the past three dec-
ades.

as a Durango police officer, as the 
Bayfield marshal, as a deputy in the 
sheriff’s office, and finally as the La 
Plata County sheriff for 20 years. 
Sheriff Schirard fought the good 
fight, and he finished his race well. His 
watch may be over, but the community 
he protected will forever be better be-
cause of his efforts day in and day out. 
While others ran away from danger, 
he ran toward it and woke up with 
courage each and every day to serve 
and protect his community. He strove 
to create peace, for ‘‘blessed are the 
peacemakers, for they will be called 
children of God.’’ 
I grieve with the people of La Plata 
County and with Sheriff Schirard’s 
family—his two sons, four stepchildren, 
and three grandchildren—and with his 
extended family in the La Plata Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office who were positively 
impacted by Sheriff Schirard’s exem-
plary life of service.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
MENTORSHIP MONTH 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, as 
chair of the Congressional Youth Men-
toring Caucus, I rise to recognize Na-
tional Mentoring Month, a time to cel-
ebrate the impact of mentoring and 
raise awareness about the critical need 
for caring adults to become mentors, as 
our youth face the often-overwhelming 
challenges of our time. 
One-third of young people in the 
United States don’t have a meaningful 
connection with adults outside their 
homes, and the pandemic has only 
made it harder for them to call on car-
ing adults for support. 
Mentoring has been one of the most 
rewarding experiences of my adult life, 
allowing me to participate in the per-
sonal and professional growth of scores 
of young people. I am fortunate to be 
able to continue that mentoring with 
some of the best and brightest young 
people in my district through our Con-
gressional Youth Cabinet, where high 
school juniors and seniors in my dis-
trict, on a monthly basis, explore the 
policy and government issues facing 
our community and our country. 
I urge all adults to think about how 
they can serve their communities and 
the next generation by becoming a 
mentor, whether through sports, career 
exploration, school, or faith-based pro-
grams.

ADDRESSING PRESIDENT BIDEN’S 
COVID CRISIS 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
devastating impacts on American lives 
and business because of Biden’s lack of 
preparedness in handling COVID–19. 
The disruptive testing shortages and 
record-breaking number of cases are a 
direct result of Biden’s failed leader-
ship. 
In the spring, the administration ig-
nored a request from a health agency 
to purchase millions of rapid tests and 
then rejected a proposal for free rapid 
tests for the holidays back in October. 
To solve this self-inflicted shortage, 
this administration’s new plan will re-
quire private insurers to cover the cost 
of tests instead of using the nearly half 
a trillion dollars from the COVID relief 
bill passed last March. 
Madam Speaker, Biden has failed to 
deliver on his promises to the Amer-
ican people. He said he would shut 
down COVID–19 and that all Americans 
would have access to regular, reliable, 
and free testing. Sadly, that couldn’t 
be further from the truth.

CAITLIN CLARK SETS NEW 
RECORD

Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
record-setting student-athlete at the 
University of Iowa. 
On 
January 
2, 
sophomore 
guard 
Caitlin Clark became the fastest player 
in Big Ten history to reach 1,000 career 
points. She accomplished this in just 40 
games, passing the previous record 
holder from Ohio State. 
Reaching this mark against Evans-
ville University, Caitlin put up a ca-
reer-high 44 points in the 93–56 win for 
the Hawkeyes. 
A lifelong Iowan, Caitlin was named 
a high school All-American before com-
ing to Iowa City and earning numerous 
accolades as a freshman, including Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year, First Team 
All-Big Ten, National Freshman of the 
Year, and First Team All-American 
honors. 
Congratulations to Caitlin. I look 
forward to watching her continue to 
dominate for the next 2 years. Go Iowa, 
and Go Hawkeyes.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FAILURES 
CAUSE SUFFERING 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I am a 
firm believer that when the President 
of the United States does well, be it 
Republican or Democrat, we as Amer-
ica benefit the most. Unfortunately, 
President Biden’s performance during 
his first year in office has been abso-
lutely terrible, and virtually all Ameri-
cans are suffering because of his fail-
ures. 
There is so much about this Presi-
dent that actually frustrates me. He 
left behind Americans in Afghanistan, 
and he has completely refused to se-
cure our southern border. Meanwhile, 
he is punishing hardworking Ameri-
cans by imposing illegal vaccine man-
dates on them. 
All across America, businesses are 
struggling to keep their doors open and 
their shelves stocked, but President 
Biden has done nothing to fix these 
issues. 
I am urging President Biden to show 
up and work on leadership for a 
change. The American people deserve 
much, much more and much better 
than what they are receiving today. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ALLOWS 
BORDER VIOLATIONS 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to remind the American peo-
ple that our national security is still 
under attack at the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der. The violation of our borders has 
been allowed to happen and is even fa-
cilitated by the Biden administration 
for nearly a year. 
Since Joe Biden took office, over 1.7 
million illegal immigrants have been 
apprehended at the southern border. 
What is worse, Joe is flying these indi-
viduals deeper into our Nation with a 
ticket you paid for. 
Because of President Biden’s failed 
open border policies, more drugs have 
been smuggled into our neighborhoods 
than ever before. CBP estimates that 
nearly 1,200 pounds of fentanyl were ap-
prehended last year alone, doubling 
from the prior year. 
Fentanyl flowing through Joe’s open 
border has caused unthinkable harm by 
poisoning our communities and killing 
our children. 
The Biden administration’s failure 
has had costly consequences. Cartels 
are profiting while Americans are pay-
ing with their tax dollars, safety, and 
lives. 
Border security is national security. 
It is time to stop risking the safety of 
innocents for the sake of politics. This 
crisis has gone on long enough. Ameri-
cans deserve better. They deserve a 
closed border, and they deserve to be 
safe.

PREVENTING CHRONIC WASTING 
DISEASE 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to discuss an im-
portant issue in Alabama and across 
the Nation. Chronic wasting disease is 
a neurological disease that affects 
deer, moose, and elk, and it is 100 per-
cent fatal. Unfortunately, there is no 
known cure. CWD could absolutely dev-
astate deer hunting in Alabama and 
the revenue it brings in each year. 
I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5608, 
the Chronic Wasting Disease Research 
and Management Act, which passed the 
House of Representatives last month.

This bill will help research and prevent 
chronic wasting disease from spreading 
further, 
protecting 
Alabama’s 
deer 
herds, outdoor economy, and tradi-

Last week, the first case of CWD was

currently only one case, it is important 
that we do what we can to prevent this 
terrible disease from spreading even 
further. I am hopeful the Senate will

I will do whatever I can in Wash-

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
860. The rule provides for consideration 
of H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI 
Bill Parity Act under a structured rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
makes in order two amendments, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act, under a 
structured rule. The rule provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. The rule also makes in 
order five amendments, provides the 
chairman of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs with en bloc authority, 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for recess 
instructions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through February 
4, 2022. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are 
here today to provide for consideration 
of two important bills to support our 
Nation’s veterans. 
H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI 
Bill Parity Act will make important 
improvements to the way GI Bill bene-
fits are calculated for our National 
Guard and Reserve veterans. Since 9/11, 
our seven individual Reserve and Guard 
components 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Armed Forces have played a larger and 
larger role in military operations. De-
spite putting on the same uniform and 
taking on many of the same risks as 
their Active Duty counterparts, these 
servicemembers don’t have access to 
the same benefits. 
Under current law, active component 
servicemembers 
receive 
credit 
for 
every day they serve while reserve 
component and National Guard service-
members earn credit depending on 
their duty status. H.R. 1836 would ex-
pand eligibility for the GI Bill to count 
every day a servicemember is paid and 
in uniform toward benefit eligibility 
and ensure parity for National Guard 
and Reserve members. It only makes 
common sense. This service would in-
clude all training and general duty for 
which basic pay is warranted. 
These men and women answer the 
call to serve without hesitation. Our 
National Guard has stepped up these 
last several years to assist in the fight 
against COVID–19, help communities 
affected by natural disasters, as in Col-
orado, we had a terrible wildfire a week 
ago and the National Guard stepped up, 
and even protecting our Capitol fol-
lowing a domestic terrorist attack. It 
is past time these servicemembers have 
access to the GI benefits they deserve.

I commend Congressman MIKE LEVIN 
for sponsoring this legislation to pro-
vide parity, and I am proud to support 
this bipartisan bill. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act, to 
improve healthcare benefits for depart-
ing Active Duty servicemembers as 
they transition into VA healthcare and 
civilian life, again, something that is 
just common sense and I thought was 
already part of the law. 
Approximately 200,000 servicemem-
bers transition out of military service 
each year. This service is difficult, de-
manding, and dangerous, and the tran-
sition from military to civilian life can 
be challenging for servicemembers who 
suffered a service-related injury or a 
traumatic experience. A recent survey 
of 10,000 veterans showed their chief 
concern in their first year after leaving 
the military is their health and their 
mental well-being. 
At this moment, veterans eligible for 
VA healthcare must choose to enroll in 
the VA’s healthcare system using its 
online, phone, or in-person services. 
However, veterans are often confused 
regarding their eligibility status for 
enrollment despite all veterans being 
eligible for VA healthcare benefits for 5 
years after separation from the mili-
tary. 
A 2014 study found symptoms of 
PTSD can be significantly improved if 
veterans 
receive 
prompt 
mental 
healthcare, and for each year a veteran 
waited to initiate treatment, there was 
a 5 percent increase in the odds of their 
PTSD not improving or even wors-
ening. Simply put, our veterans cannot 
afford to not get the healthcare they 
need and deserve. 
The EVEST Act requires the VA to 
enroll veterans in its patient enroll-
ment system within 60 days of receiv-
ing relevant information and notice 
from the Department of Defense. This 
bill uses existing DOD systems through 
the Transition Assistance Program as 
well as VA’s existing patient enroll-
ment system to enable a warm handoff 
from DOD to VA. The bill would re-
quire the VA to provide veterans notice 
of enrollment and instructions for how 
the veteran can opt out if they so wish. 
Smoother access to VA healthcare 
has never been more important than it 
is today. It is time to shift the burden 
from the veteran to the DOD and the 
VA where it belongs. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO for intro-
ducing this commonsense legislation to 
improve the health of our recently sep-
arated veterans, and I also recognize 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
his service to the country as part of 
our military. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I thank my good friend from Colo-
rado for his kind words and also for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, before I get into de-
bate, I do want to talk about my good 
friend from Colorado. I know that he 
may be moving on in some months. I 
want to say I truly am looking forward 
to working with my good friend for the 
next few months. He is a gentleman 
and a good friend both on and off the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today makes in order two pieces of leg-
islation, H.R. 1836, the Guard and Re-
serve GI Bill Parity Act of 2020 and 
also H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act. 
As a former Navy JAG, I am deeply 
committed to supporting the military 
men and women who make sacrifices 
every day to protect our freedoms, 
both at home and abroad. 
And that is why I am incredibly dis-
appointed that neither of these meas-
ures received a legislative hearing in 
the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
this Congress. 
Without input from the VA, VSOs, 
and other stakeholders, it is absolutely 
unclear the impact these bills would 
actually have, let alone whether these 
are actually workable bills. 
Take for example H.R. 1836. Repub-
licans agree that we must address the 
benefit and equity for our National 
Guardsmen and simplify the law so 
that any time spent on Active Duty for 
service other than training would 
count towards GI Bill eligibility. But 
unfortunately, the broad expansion of 
benefits in H.R. 1836 could have very 
real impacts on retention in both the 
Reserves and Active Duty. 
Additionally, it would be helpful to 
hear from VSOs and other stakeholders 
about the impact that increased inter-
est fees would have on veterans’ access 
to housing. This is a real problem, and 
I don’t think we have properly ad-
dressed it or debated it. 
These are issues that could have been 
explored. They could have been ex-
plored during a legislative hearing. 
They could have been explored to en-
sure a final product that meets the 
needs of our guardsmen and our vet-
erans. 
At the same time, while I agree that 
we must support transitioning service-
members and we must do it by con-
necting them with VA hospital care 
and medical services, this has been an 
incomplete 
legislative 
process 
that 
makes H.R. 4673 completely problem-
atic. 
According to the VA 2022 Budget doc-
uments, 9.2 million veterans are en-
rolled for care and medical services 
while 7.1 million veterans actually re-
ceive treatment at VA or community 
care facilities. So given that the budg-
ets are determined by historical enroll-
ment versus actual utilization, increas-
ing enrollment without understanding 
the impact on the VA healthcare sys-
tem could create an imbalance between 
the budgetary needs and what reality 
will show. It would also be helpful to 
understand H.R. 4673’s potential im-
pacts on access to care for current vet-
erans and the ability of VA staff and 
facilities to handle the influx of the 
new enrollees. 
To that end, last Congress we passed 
the Commander John Scott Hannon 
Veterans Mental Health Care Improve-
ment Act of 2019. This required the VA 
to submit a strategic plan to provide a 
healthcare plan to any veteran during 
the 1-year period following their dis-
charge or release from Active Duty 
service. This strategic plan is currently 
expected to be released early in 2022. So 
it would make a lot more sense to wait 
until we receive the strategic plan be-
fore we move forward with a legislative 
solution. 
Again, Madam Speaker, these are 
issues that could have been discussed 
at a legislative hearing. These issues 
could have helped ensure a veteran-fo-
cused approach to enrollment eligi-
bility for VA healthcare. Instead, the 
majority is moving forward without a 
true understanding of the real-world 
impacts of these measures. I, therefore, 
urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I would say in response to my 
friend, this is a situation in the Guard 
and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act where 
the National Guard and the Reserves 
are standing side-by-side with active 
military, and they are entitled to the 
same benefits that the active military 
has when it comes to the GI Bill. So 
that one, in my opinion, is a no- 
brainer. 
The other, and I would say, the VSOs, 
the veteran service organizations sup-
porting the Guard and Reserve GI Bill 
Parity Act, H.R. 1836, are Student Vet-
erans of America, National Guard As-
sociation of the U.S., Enlisted Associa-
tion of the National Guard of the 
United States, and the Reserve Officers 
Association of the U.S. 
b 1245 
With respect so the EVEST legisla-
tion, H.R. 4637, again, here we are, peo-
ple have acted with military service 
and then have to opt in as opposed to 
just let the system move quickly for 
them to become part of the veterans 
medical care and benefits system. And 
we have a number of different organiza-
tions that support that. 
VSOs supporting that are the Para-
lyzed Veterans of America, the Dis-
abled American Veterans, the Nurses 
Organization of Veterans Affairs, and 
the Veterans Healthcare Policy Insti-
tute. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), a distinguished member of 
the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my esteemed colleague, Congressman 
PERLMUTTER, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the bills included in 
this rule serve as an expression of grat-
itude for all veterans, regardless of 
their official service status. 
My State of North Carolina alone has 
nearly 12,000 National Guard members, 
each of whom deserves to be recognized

for their sacrifice on behalf of our Na-
tion. 
Reservists and National Guard mem-
bers take on challenging, admirable, 
and oftentimes lifesaving work, espe-
cially throughout the COVID–19 crisis. 
We owe it to these exceptional Ameri-
cans to provide gold-standard edu-
cation benefits, medical care, and men-
tal health support. 
A critical inflection point in all vet-
erans’ lives is their transition to civil-
ian life. We know that during this pe-
riod, veterans disproportionately face 
mental health crises. That is why in 
partnership 
with 
Congresswoman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, Congressman BOW-
MAN, Congresswoman MOORE, I have of-
fered an amendment to H.R. 1836 that 
takes proactive steps to offer support. 
Our amendment requires the VA to 
provide new veterans with information 
on the medical services they can ac-
cess, including the mental health care 
and military sexual trauma resources 
to which they are entitled. 
My father served as a psychiatrist in 
the Air Force during the Vietnam era, 
a particularly challenging time for our 
veterans. He witnessed firsthand the 
need for mental health care among this 
population. 
In addition, one of the issues—mili-
tary sexual trauma, leaving veterans 
with scars, both physical and psycho-
logical—is affected by this legislation. 
I have introduced other legislation on 
this issue and I am committed to help-
ing veterans who have experienced this 
trauma access support. 
Veterans can’t benefit from VA serv-
ices unless they know about them. Un-
fortunately, many veterans lack infor-
mation of the full range of resources 
available. Our amendment will raise 
awareness among transitioning vet-
erans about VA services and the care 
they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the amendment, the 
rule, and the underlying bill. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, during my opening statement, 
I referenced the strategic plan that the 
VA is undertaking that we are sup-
posed to get in early 2022. And the rea-
son for that is we typically need data 
before we legislate, but we do have 
data on another topic, and that is the 
damage that our children are facing by 
being kept out of school. 
Madam Speaker, we have nearly 2 
full years of data that show that keep-
ing kids out of classrooms has caused 
massive learning loss, a mental health 
epidemic, 
particularly 
among 
our 
youth, and stressful situations for mil-
lions of families. Recently, children in 
Chicago have been forced to endure vir-
tual hearings after the Chicago Teach-
ers Union refused to do their jobs and 
show up for in-person classes. 
House Republicans believe schools 
should be open and that our children 
come first. In some municipalities, 
bowling alleys have opened before our 
schools. It is shameful. 
Madam Speaker, that is why if we de-
feat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider H.R. 682, the 
Reopen Schools Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with any extraneous material, imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), my 
good friend, the legislation’s author, 
here to explain the amendment. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for yielding. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
our 
amendment 
would ensure that students are no 
longer kept out of the classroom and 
forced to learn from behind a screen. It 
would ensure that parents are able to 
return to the workplace. It would help 
combat the ongoing youth mental 
health crisis spurred by school clo-
sures. 
Madam Speaker, my bill, the Reopen 
Schools Act, would condition Federal 
COVID grants to schools on those 
schools actually being open and oper-
ating in the first place, which is what 
that money was intended to do. 
I am proud that my home State of 
Iowa—and I am thankful to our Gov-
ernor, Kim Reynolds—for ensuring that 
Iowa students could go back to school. 
In Iowa, kids have been back in the 
classroom, where they belong, for over 
a year. They get to socialize with their 
peers and they get hands-on learning 
help from their teachers. They get to 
run and jump at recess. They get to 
raise their hands to ask and answer 
questions instead of clicking a button 
from behind a screen. They get to write 
on white boards during their lessons. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case in 
the rest of the country. So many stu-
dents are still trapped behind screens. 
And what about the students who don’t 
have regular computer and broadband 
internet access? What about students 
in households without computers or 
even households with only one com-
puter where mom and dad are maybe 
trying to use it for work. 
Virtual learning means we are leav-
ing behind our most vulnerable stu-
dents, our rural students, our students 
with additional learning challenges, 
and even kids who have every virtual 
advantage are struggling. Families are 
struggling. Working parents are chal-
lenged like never before, and American 
kids are suffering and paying the price 
for it. 
As a mom, I have personally felt this 
pressure, and I know many of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle know 
what it is like to have kids trying to 
learn at home while you are trying to 
work at the same time. So this is not 
a partisan issue. This is about our kids. 
This is about supporting working fami-
lies. Kids need to be in school. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in defeating the pre-
vious 
question 
so 
we 
can 
reopen 
schools and prevent taxpayer dollars 
from keeping kids at home. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the comments of Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER and Mrs. HINSON about 
schools. But this, in a word, is the Con-
gress of the United States. This is not 
the Des Moines school board or the 
Punxsutawney school board where they 
may have individual respective issues 
for their area. 
Madam Speaker, my wife is a teach-
er—as you are—and in Jefferson Coun-
ty, Colorado, the schools are open. 
Now, are people getting sick? Is there 
a lot of pressure on teachers? You bet 
there is. But those schools are open. 
So I appreciate the comments of my 
friends about wanting to open the 
schools in Chicago or maybe wanting 
to open them someplace else, but they 
are open. And so I am not exactly sure 
what they are railing against other 
than maybe the school board of Chi-
cago or the school board of Des Moines. 
Madam Speaker, I yield three min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
spoken like my good friend from Colo-
rado, Mr. PERLMUTTER—who I really 
insist that he remain in this body for 
his astuteness and his way of ana-
lyzing—might I just take a quick mo-
ment to say that the schools of Amer-
ica are open. But today, the hos-
pitalization rate for omicron is the 
highest ever since we have had COVID– 
19. 
And so I believe that school super-
intendents, teachers, parents, and oth-
ers—like Madam Speaker—are making 
decisions for our children to be in 
school but also to be safe. 
Madam Speaker, I move on these two 
very important legislative initiatives, 
H.R. 1836 and H.R. 4673. I thank the 
gentleman from Colorado. I thank my 
good friend who has served in the 
United States military from Pennsyl-
vania. I thank him for his service as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I rise enthusiasti-
cally on this legislation for a number 
of reasons, but more importantly, I 
have worked extensively with the 
Guard, particularly the Texas National 
Guard. We in Texas can sometimes be 
called disaster alley as it relates to 
hurricanes and tornadoes, as it relates 
to COVID–19. And alongside of us on 
those battles, if you will, saving lives 
have been the National Guard. We are 
grateful for their service. They are cit-
izen soldiers. 
I think we don’t acknowledge that 
what the Guard is is individuals who 
put on the uniform, leaving being a bus 
driver or a teacher or a mechanic, law-
yer or doctor; and in doing so, they 
sacrifice and leave their families. So I 
am excited about H.R. 1836 by Mr. 
LEVIN because right now in terms of 
education, it is Active Duty, those in-
dividuals in active military service, in-
cluding full-time training and annual

January 11, 2022 
training. But H.R. 1836 will expand the 
eligibility criteria to include those 
training in full-time National Guard 
duty. They are on the front lines. 
In my hospital during COVID–19, it 
was the Guard that came as nurses and 
support systems when we were literally 
overwhelmed with patients. It is the 
Guard that is coming back again to be 
able to help us now that we are also at 
the peak. Texas Children’s Hospital 
seeing more sick COVID–19-impacted 
children in their history, the Guard is 
vital. 
And I would just say that this is not 
about data. It is about the lives of our 
Guard. And I want to move to say how 
important it is to get our young sol-
diers on to the healthcare system 
under the bill of Mr. TAKANO as quickly 
as they come out. It is not about data, 
it is about saving lives. 
And that leads me to Governor Ab-
bott’s untimely and wrong policies in 
Texas. I will be seeking an official in-
vestigation from the department in 
Washington, the Secretary of Defense 
and the Pentagon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
the issue is very clear. In his wrong-
headed dispatching of our guard to the 
border—of course, this is a Federal re-
sponsibility, the southern border—we 
now have documented crises, guards 
committing suicide, guards not getting 
their paychecks, and guards having 
their education tuition slashed. Yes, 
that is what is happening in the State 
of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I am a fighter for 
the Guard. They have worked without 
ceasing and question. And I demand 
that this Congress, this Committee on 
Armed Services, the Pentagon, inves-
tigate when the commander of a par-
ticular State abuses those individuals 
who have put on the uniform as citizen 
soldiers and who are in desperate need 
of our help. 
Suicide? Not getting your paychecks 
timely because you are dispatching 
people to the border without order and 
without understanding? 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, but I am calling upon my col-
leagues to help me, help these young 
soldiers with family members who, at 
this point as we stand here, are not 
getting the kind of treatment equating 
to their dignity, their service, and 
their sacrifice. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support 
of the Rule for House consideration of H.R. 
1836, Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, 
and H.R. 4673, EVEST Act. 
I thank Rules Committee Chairman MCGOV-
ERN for shepherding this legislation to the 
floor. 
I also thank House Veterans Committee 
Chair MARK TAKANO, for his stewardship of the 
committee and unwavering commitment to our 
nation’s veterans. 
H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill 
Parity Act will expand eligibility criteria for cer-
tain education benefits. 
Current law defines the term ‘‘active duty’’ 
as those individuals who are on full-time duty 
in the active military service of the United 
States, including full-time training duty, annual 
training duty, and attendance, while in the ac-
tive military service, at a school designated as 
a service school by law or by the Secretary of 
the military department concerned. 
H.R. 1836, will expand eligibility criteria to 
include those training in fulltime National 
Guard duty, which includes the National 
Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air 
National Guard, as well as those same mem-
bers when performing active duty. 
H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act, would forward 
the goal of seamless enrollment in health care 
coverage. 
Specifically, this bill will require the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to automatically 
enroll new veterans into VA health care, and 
notify veterans of their enrollment and instruc-
tions on how to un-enroll, if desired. 
I rise today to pay tribute to all the men and 
women who have served in the Armed Forces 
of the United States and risked their lives to 
defend our freedoms and way of life and took 
and lived the oath to ‘‘support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States against all 
enemies, foreign and domestic’’ and bore true 
faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation 
they took freely, without any mental reserva-
tion or purpose of evasion. 
Veterans are truly heroes walking among 
us. 
I want to thank all of our armed serviceman 
and women for their selfless dedication to our 
protection every day. 
Today’s Rule includes a very important bill 
that provides for our nation’s reservists, H.R. 
1836, Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act. 
When it is signed into law it will repair a dis-
parity issue by placing the Guard and Reserve 
on equal footing with regards to GI bill bene-
fits. 
This Rule, in which we further the benefits 
and recognition that our veterans deserve, 
also reminds us that we have an overriding 
duty to protect the health and dignity of those 
service today. 
For this reason, I would like to discuss the 
actions of the Texas Governor, because he is 
taking whatever steps he can to prevent local 
jurisdictions and municipalities in Texas from 
promulgating and enforcing any mandate that 
may be necessary to respond to and mitigate 
the substantial threat posed by the COVID–19 
coronavirus pandemic. 
It is no exaggeration to say that Executive 
Orders issued by the Texas Governor have 
consigned thousands of Texans to needless 
death and suffering. 
According to virtually all public health ex-
perts, these deaths and suffering could be al-
leviated by taking the simple but life-saving 
precautions of getting a vaccination shot, 
wearing a protective face covering, and main-
taining recommended social distancing. 
To date, the COVID–19 virus has afflicted 
more than 35.3 million persons in the United 
States and more than 5.09 million Texas. 
In Harris County alone, the number is ap-
proaching 753,000 cases and already 9,821 
persons have died of the virus, which rep-
resents more than 10 percent of the 76,839 
Texas lives claimed by this lethal disease. 
To exacerbate matters, in March 2021, the 
Texas Governor launched the ill-fated and in-
effective Operation Lone Star which he 
claimed was necessary to stem a so-called in-
vasion of migrants at Texas’ southern border. 
As of November 2021, more than 10,000 
Texas National Guardsmen have been de-
ployed to the southern border in pursuit of this 
folly. 
According to published media accounts, Na-
tional Guard members who have been acti-
vated for Operation Lone Star are experi-
encing habitual pay delays and poor working 
conditions during the border mission, including 
being exposed to COVID–19, and many are 
missing the equipment necessary for safety 
and mission success. 
Finally, just last week the Texas Governor 
filed a frivolous lawsuit in federal court chal-
lenging the authority of President Biden, the 
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to 
require that members of the National Guard 
be vaccinated against COVID–19. 
There is no merit to this nuisance law suit 
as demonstrated by the summary rejection of 
similar arguments raised by neighboring Okla-
homa Governor Stitt. 
The Texas Governor’s failure to comply with 
the policies intended to reduce the spread of 
COVID–19 among the Armed Forces will 
mean that there will be less military personnel 
available national disasters that have struck 
Texas in recent years, such as the winter 
freeze of last year. 
This will also mean that there are fewer per-
sonnel to respond to any attacks on the home-
land. 
Encouraged by Governor Abbott’s obsti-
nacy, about 40 percent of the members of the 
Texas Army National Guard are refusing to 
get vaccinated, which puts at risk their col-
leagues and the persons they are sworn to 
defend and protect. 
This Rule governs debate of excellent and 
common-sense bills that will enhance the re-
spect and benefits of our servicemen and 
women. 
We must also act to ensure that our service-
men and women are protected from COVID– 
19, both for their own safety and the safety of 
our nation. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I appreciate my good 
friend from Texas talking about sui-
cide. If we want to talk about suicide, 
let’s look at the youth of this country. 
Here is the statistic: 
The number of ER visits for sus-
pected suicide attempts by 12- to 17- 
year-old girls rose by 51 percent in 2021 
compared to 2019. Suicide attempts are 
up 51 percent. So let’s talk about sui-
cide and let’s talk about the effect that 
these shutdowns are having on our 
youth. 
I know my good friend from Colorado 
said this is just an issue in Chicago 
when we were talking about Chicago. 
Chicago is just an example of the shut-
downs. 
There are over 4,500 schools across 
the country that chose to begin the 
week of January 2 by shutting down, 
which clearly disrupted learning. 
b 1300 
This isn’t just a Republican stat. I 
have a New York Times article that 
has even more facts on this. Remem-
ber, it was President Biden who prom-
ised that he was going to shut down the

virus, not shut down the economy and 
not shut down schools. He has actually 
done the exact opposite. 
Here is another statistic. More Amer-
icans have died from COVID–19 in 2021 
than in 2020. That is under President 
Biden’s watch. 
We can hear excuses all day long 
about what can be done, but the fact is 
this: This is a crisis that Joe Biden and 
the other party across the aisle own. 
There is no excuse. They control the 
White House and the Senate, and they 
have the majority in the House. This 
has been done on their watch. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
HERN) to talk more about this topic. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my dear friend from Pennsylvania for 
yielding me 21⁄2 minutes to speak about 
something today that we need to shed 
light on, which is an issue impacting 
an entire generation of students. 
Children from preschool age through 
college have been barred from their 
classrooms for the better part of 2 
years now. Many of us have stated 
from the start that shutting down 
schools would create more problems 
than it would solve, and now the data 
proves us right. 
Still, some teachers’ unions refuse to 
work. They refuse to put the well-being 
of the students’ futures first. 
Americans are sick and tired of the 
Federal Government moving the goal-
posts and changing the ‘‘science’’ to fit 
whatever narrative they want. 
The President of the United States 
repeatedly 
caved 
to 
the 
teachers’ 
unions, ignoring the needs of our stu-
dents to the detriment of our children 
across the country. Now that he has 
seen the polling on school closures, he 
says the schools should reopen, con-
tinuing to move the goalposts. 
Suicide and self-harm among stu-
dents hit record highs while schools 
were closed. Mental health problems 
are on the rise among kids of all ages. 
Test scores are abysmal. All of these 
issues trace back to the closure of our 
schools. 
When schools remain closed, our chil-
dren are harmed. Parents are having to 
take their children to work, to their 
jobs, because they have no way of hav-
ing their children cared for during the 
day. 
Students need to be in school envi-
ronments for more than just an edu-
cation. The social skills developed 
through their school years have a di-
rect impact on the adults and members 
of society that these children will grow 
into. 
What will the next generation of 
leaders look like? What will the next 
generation of doctors, scientists, or en-
gineers look like if this is their edu-
cation today? In 20 years, our society 
will be dependent on this generation in 
the workforce and throughout our soci-
ety. We are failing to prepare our chil-
dren for it. 
The future of our Nation belongs to 
the children. Yes, it really is for the 
children. Can anyone in this Chamber 
look at the actions of the last 2 years 
and say we are serving our children’s 
best interests? The answer is a re-
sounding no. 
Madam Speaker, I urge consideration 
of Congresswoman HINSON’s legislation 
to ensure our students are back in the 
classroom. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would just respond 
to my friend from Oklahoma, as well as 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Ob-
viously, they have some issues with 
their school systems if this is the prob-
lem that they are bringing up. 
In Colorado, schools are open. I can 
tell you that my wife, Nancy, is pretty 
stressed because COVID is still around 
and the teaching ranks have been hit 
by COVID. There is a lot of stress on 
teachers, but the schools are open. 
Maybe those gentlemen need to talk 
to their school boards. In Colorado, we 
believe in local control. In Colorado, 
we have kept these open. 
I would just suggest to the gentlemen 
to take a look at their own school 
boards instead of having some national 
standard that they want to create here 
about keeping schools open, because 
they are open. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. RESCHENTHALER 
mentioned something about the econ-
omy. Let’s talk about the economy. 
Let’s start with the stock market. 
The stock market is up 10,000 points 
since Joe Biden took office. Madam 
Speaker, 10,000 points. Do you know 
what that means? It is $1.4 billion per 
point. It means the stock market is up 
$14 trillion in 1 year under Joe Biden. 
Since Donald Trump lost, the stock 
market is up $14 trillion. 
If that weren’t enough, let’s talk 
about how many jobs have been added 
since Joe Biden won and Donald Trump 
lost. Madam Speaker, 6.2 million jobs 
have been added in the last year. 
Wages have increased by 4.7 percent, 
at levels we haven’t seen for decades. 
We had the sharpest drop in unem-
ployment since Joe Biden won and 
Donald Trump lost, over the course of 
the last year, down to 3.9 percent. 
The stock market is up. Jobs are up. 
Wages are up. My friends are com-
plaining about the economy. Well, they 
have to complain about something, so 
that is what they want to complain 
about. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am actually glad 
the economy came up because this is 
truly a disaster. We can talk about the 
stock market, but I can tell you that 
the people in my district don’t care 
about Wall Street. They are focused on 
Main Street. 
When everything they buy every day, 
whether it is bacon at the grocery 
store or gasoline at the gas station, 
costs more, it takes money out of their 
paychecks. 
Don’t take my word. Let’s turn to 
some statistics. 
The December jobs report was the 
worst of Joe Biden’s Presidency, with 
the U.S. economy actually adding just 
under 200,000 jobs when it was projected 
to add roughly half a million jobs, 
grossly falling short of what all the 
economists were projecting. 
The December jobs report was the 
worst of the Biden Presidency. The 
labor force participation rates de-
creased 
for 
the 
following 
demo-
graphics. African-American men 20 and 
older declined in job participation. Af-
rican-American teenagers, Asian Amer-
icans, and Hispanic and Latino Ameri-
cans all had falling numbers under the 
Biden economy. 
Again, let’s just look at inflation. 
Gasoline is up 58 percent. We haven’t 
seen increases like this in gasoline 
since the last time that Joe Biden was 
in the White House. Car and truck 
rentals are up over 37 percent. As I ref-
erenced, bacon is up over 21 percent. 
Fish and seafood are up 10 percent. 
Eggs are up 8 percent. Coffee is up 7.5 
percent. 
What this means is the real wages of 
American workers, which have stag-
nated, are even worse than they were 
before this Presidency because every-
thing the American worker buys costs 
more thanks to Joe Biden and thanks 
to the party across the aisle’s eco-
nomic policies. 
I want to talk more about schools 
that were referenced. Let’s talk about 
schools. I have a New York Times arti-
cle. ‘‘No Way to Grow Up’’ is the title. 
American children are in crisis. It was 
published on January 4. This is a New 
York Times article. 
Among third through eighth graders, 
math and reading levels were lower 
than normal this fall, according to 
NWEA, which is a research group. 
Many children and teenagers are ex-
periencing mental health problems ag-
gravated by the isolation and disrup-
tion of the pandemic. 
Three medical groups, including the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, re-
cently declared a national state of 
emergency in children’s health. 
What is really shocking about this is 
the party across the aisle claims to be 
the party of science. I think the party 
across the aisle has forever forfeited 
the right to call themselves the party 
of science because nothing that they 
have done has been based on science— 
maybe political science, but not real 
science. 
Here is the real science. Data now 
suggests that the many changes to 
school routines are of questionable 
value in controlling the virus’ spread. 
Some researchers are skeptical that 
school closures actually reduce COVID 
cases in most instances. 
Here we have the so-called party of 
science using unscientific rationale to 
shut down schools, which we know is 
damaging kids both from an education

point of view and a mental health point 
of view, damaging kids while having 
zero science to back that up. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to urge my colleagues 
to defeat the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 682, 
the Reopen Schools Act. 
As a father of four, I know just how 
important it is to families across the 
country that our schools stay open and 
our kids keep learning. 
I want to pause for a moment to 
highlight what we are hearing right 
now. I fully appreciate my Democrat 
colleagues talking about federalism. I 
am very supportive of that in the face 
of sweeping Federal mandates that are 
going to inflict an enormous workforce 
burden on all of our private-sector 
companies in my district with a Fed-
eral vaccine mandate. We are trying to 
say: Don’t do that. That is not the 
right approach. 
I am hearing the same thing, that it 
is not the right approach to tell each 
school board what they are doing. Let 
me set just a clear concept of what we 
are talking about here. There is Fed-
eral money involved. We want school 
boards to make decisions—I have even 
incorporated it into my speech that I 
will share here in a minute—to use 
these Federal dollars that are designed 
to help keep schools open. 
We need to make sure that these 
schools stay open. Let’s all embrace 
federalism. That is the goal. President 
Biden just realized it a few weeks ago 
when he said we can’t solve this at the 
Federal level. We fully embrace that. 
In-person learning is critical for our 
children’s well-being. From mental 
health to reading and math skills, 
American students are struggling. 
COVID is spreading, and we can em-
brace commonsense precautions, em-
bracing federalism, like masks and 
testing, where relevant. But our kids 
need to be in the classroom. 
Rolling school closures are exacting 
a staggering toll on our children, par-
ticularly those with special needs or 
those who are already vulnerable or be-
hind academically. 
Low-income families with parents 
who work outside the home are most at 
risk when schools shut down. Moms 
and 
dads 
race 
to 
find 
makeshift 
childcare just to be able to go to work 
and feed their families, and vulnerable 
kids fall further and further behind on 
their schoolwork. We cannot fail these 
students. 
Congress allocated $54.3 billion for 
the Elementary and Secondary School 
Emergency Relief Fund to help schools 
reopen and stay open. Those funds 
must be used to prioritize the expenses 
that keep schools open. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I am grateful for Utah’s educators 
and superintendents who are working 
hard to do what is right by our stu-
dents. They are working hard; I see it. 
Families across the country are trying 
the best they can, and we must commit 
to supporting them in return. 
A vote for the previous question is a 
vote for our students and our future. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of the gentleman from Utah, 
as well as my friend from Pennsyl-
vania. They are focusing on schools. 
Okay, focus on schools. Obviously, I 
think local control of these school dis-
tricts is the appropriate way to go and 
not kind of a Federal mandate. 
Obviously, we would like to see vac-
cines used more and COVID eliminated. 
If we got everybody vaccinated and 
people wore masks, I think that would 
be the direction we would go. 
What these bills are about, and what 
this rule is about, is the mental health 
of our National Guard and Reserve 
troops. We are talking about the Na-
tional Guard, and we are talking about 
the Reserves. 
They may want to bring in a school 
bill, which is completely unrelated to 
the topic at hand, but what we are 
talking about here should have been ei-
ther passed under some kind of an ex-
pedited fashion or it should be the law 
already. Obviously, they want to argue 
about something that is not before the 
body because they can’t argue against 
these two bills. 
We want to make sure that there is 
parity that exists between the National 
Guard and Reserve and active military 
when it comes to the GI Bill and the 
ability of those individuals to take ad-
vantage of the benefits of the GI Bill, 
which will benefit this Nation greatly. 
My dad had a saying about the origi-
nal GI Bill. He said: America has made 
many investments, but of the two best 
investments that America made, the 
Louisiana Purchase was second only to 
the GI Bill in terms of the value to 
America. 
Here we are, talking about all sorts 
of other things and not parity for Na-
tional Guardsmen, Reserve officers, 
and Reserve troops with the ability to 
access the GI Bill. 
We are also ignoring the mental 
health issues that so many coming out 
of the military may experience once 
they are out of the Department of De-
fense, out of their active service. We 
want to make sure there is a seamless 
approach to them entering into the VA 
system. 
Madam Speaker, I understand my 
friends arguing about everything else, 
but what we have before us are very 
important matters that have to be ad-
dressed. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, again, I just want to reiterate 
that I have said if we defeat the pre-
vious question I will personally offer 
an amendment to the rule to imme-
diately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen 
Schools Act, to help our children who 
are in school who are suffering. That is 
why this is now an issue. 
To speak more on that, Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to say thank you to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania for a few 
minutes here. I appreciate it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the 
previous question and in support of the 
Reopen Schools Act. We are hearing 
today that, in terms of priorities here, 
what could be more important than 
schools and getting our schools open 
with the damage that has been done 
over the last couple years? 
During the early days of the pan-
demic many schools across the country 
were shuttered. But now some 2 years 
in, I believe we have the tools and re-
sources to keep our schools open— 
something we all know is in the best 
interest of our kids. 
Since March of 2020, the Federal Gov-
ernment has provided $190 billion in 
pandemic aid to schools to upgrade 
their mitigation systems and get kids 
back in the classrooms safely. Unfortu-
nately, last week the teachers union in 
Chicago decided to walk out on their 
students. The standoff has kept 340,000 
students—the third largest school sys-
tem in the United States—out of the 
classroom. Worryingly, we are now see-
ing other teachers unions across the 
country looking to follow their lead 
and pushing for a return to remote 
learning. 
So our colleague across the aisle here 
asked: What are we railing against? 
Aren’t we in support of local control? 
Of course we are. But what we are 
seeing in the State of Wisconsin now is 
that the Department of Health Serv-
ices, at the behest of the Governor, is 
pushing for more restrictions. A letter 
just went out today to all school dis-
tricts across the State of Wisconsin: 
You should be putting more restric-
tions in place. 
It is very similar to what the Centers 
for Disease Control has done. It is ex-
tremely hard for someone at the local 
level to simply stand up against this 
onslaught of regulations and sugges-
tions that you have to do this other-
wise children are going to be damaged. 
How are you going to stand up 
against that when you are just a small, 
local school district? 
Even 
the 
Education 
Secretary, 
Miguel Cardona, took a stand by say-
ing that students have suffered enough 
and schools should stay open. I agree. 
Last year’s school closures were ex-
tremely hard on parents and students 
leading to significant learning loss. 
That is a scenario we cannot afford to 
repeat this academic year. We owe it to

our kids to get back to in-person in-
struction. H.R. 682 ensures that the ad-
ditional $190 billion in pandemic aid ac-
tually goes towards what it was in-
tended: getting kids back in the class-
room. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to close 
by saying this: I remember back in 
April of 2020, a couple weeks into the 
shutdowns and lockdowns, we knew 
whom this was going to affect the 
most, and we knew that children are at 
very low risk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Wisconsin an additional 10 seconds. 
Mr. TIFFANY. In fact, the head of 
the CDC at that time, Dr. Redfield, 
said that kids should be back in school. 
They are at less risk than the cold and 
flu with COVID. Kids should be back in 
school. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question so we can consider 
this critical piece of legislation put 
forward by the gentlewoman from 
Iowa. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire as to how much time 
each side has remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
friends wanting to talk about the Chi-
cago Teachers Union because, again, 
they don’t want to talk about the Na-
tional Guard; they don’t want to talk 
about the Reserve; they don’t want to 
talk about the GI Bill; and they don’t 
want to talk about mental health bene-
fits or health benefits generally for 
veterans because they don’t have any 
complaint about that. There is just a 
whole other conversation going on 
here. 
Again, I don’t know what is going on 
in Wisconsin, whether the gentleman 
has a complaint against collective bar-
gaining in Wisconsin; I don’t know if it 
is the problem in Pennsylvania if there 
is an issue with collective bargaining. 
That is not the issue before the House 
today. 
Madam Speaker, we need to get these 
National Guard and Reserve pieces of 
legislation passed, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am a veteran in 
the Navy. I was a naval officer. I de-
ployed to Iraq. I will talk about vet-
eran issues all day long, and we can 
start by talking about the VA loan 
that needs reform so veterans can actu-
ally use this loan in a hot market 
where sellers simply will refuse to ac-
cept that loan. I will sit up here and 
talk about that all day, and I have 
been talking about veterans’ issues. 
But let’s just step back. We have had 
almost 1 year of one-party rule, one 
party controlling the White House, the 
Senate, and the House for 1 year. 
And what has that given us? 
It has given us an absolute crisis—a 
disaster—at the southern border. It has 
given us rampant COVID deaths that 
actually exceed what they were last 
year despite the fact that this Presi-
dent inherited from President Trump 
Operation Warp Speed which gave him 
three vaccines and a list of thera-
peutics that could be used. Despite all 
that, this is still an unmitigated dis-
aster that Biden and his Democratic 
colleagues have created. 
We also have inflation and stagna-
tion. 
American 
workers 
have 
less 
money to buy the goods and services 
they need. We have Russia poised to in-
vade Ukraine. We have Communist 
China daily invading the airspace of 
the free and independent nation state 
of Taiwan. And don’t even get me 
started on the fact that we ceded Af-
ghanistan to the Taliban after 18 
months of stability in a nation that 
saw zero American fatalities and sta-
bility for our Afghan allies, and we 
handed it over to the Taliban. 
That is what 1 year of one-party rule 
has given this country: an unmitigated 
disaster. 
Now, getting back to schools, I know 
that my colleagues on the left want to 
say that this is just an issue for Chi-
cago or some other city. Forty-five 
hundred schools shut down the first 
week of January is a national issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Louisiana (Ms. 
LETLOW) to talk more about it. 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so we 
can immediately consider H.R. 682, the 
Reopen Schools Act. I believe that this 
legislation is critical for our students, 
to ensure success in the current school 
year, and also address the learning gap 
that has arisen during this pandemic. 
As parents, we know that education 
is the most essential cornerstone in the 
foundation of our children’s future. 
Throughout the past year I have heard 
from countless parents who had to put 
their lives on hold to assume the role 
of teacher in their child’s virtual class-
room, while other family priorities, in-
cluding returning to work, took a 
backseat. 
As a former educator myself, I know 
how crucial classroom discussion is to 
the learning process. The statistics 
clearly show that students learn better 
when they are able to participate in 
person and interact with their peers 
and teachers, and not reduced to just a 
face on a screen. 
I also want to note that in rural 
areas such as my district, successful 
virtual learning is nearly impossible 
because of the lack of access to 
broadband internet. In my home State 
of Louisiana, our standardized tests 
show that the number of students in 
grades 3 through 8 who achieved the 
State’s proficiency goals fell by nearly 
5 percent during the pandemic. 
Over the past 2 years, Congress has 
appropriated billions of dollars so 
schools can take the necessary steps to 
reopen safely. I want to be clear: We 
are not asking schools to put either 
students or teachers into unsafe envi-
ronments. We did not send States and 
districts that funding for them to sim-
ply shut their doors again. 
Madam Speaker, it is absolutely crit-
ical for us to move forward on this leg-
islation to ensure that American stu-
dents can continue to learn in safe, 
face-to-face 
classrooms 
across 
this 
country. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like my friend from 
Colorado to know that I have no fur-
ther speakers and that I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I would just like to thank the gentle-
woman from Louisiana for talking 
about the need for broadband because 
in the American Rescue Plan there is 
funding for broadband for rural areas 
such as she represents as well as in the 
infrastructure bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time so my friend can close. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, as a former Navy 
JAG, I strongly support efforts to en-
sure our military men and women re-
ceive the care and benefits they de-
serve both during and after their peri-
ods of service. It is, therefore, incred-
ibly disappointing to me that the two 
bills made in order under today’s rule 
present numerous issues and numerous 
uncertainties that could have been ad-
dressed through what could have been 
just a robust discussion with the VA, 
VSOs, and other stakeholder groups. 
I really hope that moving forward we 
can just work together to ensure that 
through the legislative process we ad-
dress the needs of our Nation’s vet-
erans. 
Again, I would urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so 
that I can offer the amendment to Re-
open Schools Act. 
So, again, Madam Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I want to just recognize my friend for 
his service to our country both in the 
military and here in the United States 
Congress. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
joining me here today to speak on the 
rule, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill 
Parity Act, and the EVEST Act and 
how we provide and care for our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
We have an opportunity through pas-
sage of both bills to improve the 
healthcare of our separating service-
members and ensure our National 
Guard and Reserve component mem-
bers receive parity in their GI Bill ben-
efits to thank them for their service to

Veterans’ Affairs Committee for their 
work 
along 
with 
Chairman 
MARK 
TAKANO
and 
Representative 
MIKE 
LEVIN for sponsoring these important 
bills. 
As we kick off 2022 and continue the 
House’s work for the people, I am glad 
we are starting with our Nation’s vet-
erans. I want to thank my friend and 
colleague, Mr. RESCHENTHALER, and the 
numerous other veterans who have 
served in this body for, again, service 
both in the military and service here in 
the United States Congress. I have al-
ways fought hard for our Nation’s vet-
erans throughout my time in Congress 
as my way to show my gratitude for 
their service and fulfill my belief that 
it is our country’s responsibility to 
care for our Nation’s veterans after 
they have cared for us. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’

eration of the bill are waived. The bill shall

MARSHALL FIRE 
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, just 
over a week ago, on December 30, a 
devastating disaster hit the Boulder 
community. Fueled by hurricane-force 
winds, 
exacerbated 
by 
months 
of 
drought and dry conditions, the Mar-
shall fire spread through the suburban 
neighborhoods of Louisville and Supe-
rior with a speed and magnitude that 
we have never witnessed before. 
Over 1,000 homes and businesses de-
stroyed. Over 30,000 individuals evacu-
ated. Countless families and commu-
nity members dealing now with unprec-
edented loss left only with the clothes 
on their backs and the items carried in 
their departure. One known fatality 
and still one member of our commu-
nity missing. Our hearts ache for every 
single person touched by this disaster.

For every first responder and fire-
fighter that worked to keep our com-
munity safe, we owe you a debt of grat-
itude. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I close by 
saying that I have lived in this commu-
nity for many, many years. And we 
know that even in this unprecedented 
and terrible tragedy, that we are 
strong, that our community is resil-
ient, and that our community will get

RECOGNIZING ERIC BERGREN’S 27 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
KEN-
TUCKY’S SECOND DISTRICT 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Eric Bergren’s 
27 years of service to Kentucky’s Sec-
ond District. 
Eric, a graduate of UMass, started 
working for Kentucky’s Second Dis-
trict in 1994. Eric worked his way up 
from an intern to become the chief of 
staff under Congressman Lewis, my 
predecessor. During that time, Eric 
met his wife, Kathy Reding, a native of 
Howardstown, Kentucky, in the Second 
District. Eric and Kathy are now proud 
parents of Cecelia and Julia. 
Eric has been at my side since 2009 
when I was sworn in. I believe I have 
had the best chief, and others have af-
firmed that. On a personal note, we 
have both watched our kids grow up 
and shared with each other the joys of 
being a father. 
Madam Speaker, I am losing a chief 
but I am not losing a great friend. 
Thanks for everything, Eric, and I wish 
you the best for your next chapter.

SALUTE TO HARRY REID 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to salute the late majority 
leader, Harry Reid, who served his Na-
tion for 48 years in public service by 
appointment or election. But Harry 
Reid can be more than the public serv-
ice that he has given. He is and was a 
true patriot, a family man, and some-
one who cared enough to not only se-
cure this Nation but to mentor and to 
love his State and to love America. 
Thousands—no, millions of Ameri-
cans, at all economic levels, have 
healthcare because of Harry Reid. Ne-
vada was prevented from being a nu-
clear waste dumping ground because of 
Harry Reid. And I stood by him, glad to 
have known him—I, as a member of the 
United States House; he, then in the 
United States Senate. 
It is with deep sympathy that I offer 
to his family and friends and the people 
of Nevada for he truly was an Amer-
ican patriot—tough, but strong and 
kind. And may I say, he served as a 
U.S. Capitol Hill police officer. What a 
man—a boxer, but always a patriot. 
May he rest in peace and may he 
know that his 48 years—44 of them in 
the United States Congress—counts to-
ward his historical mark of changing 
America, making America the place 
where no matter who you are you have 
an opportunity to succeed and to over-
come. He did that and helped others as 
well. 
Thank you to patriot Majority Lead-
er Harry Reid. May he rest in peace 
and may he rest in power.

106TH ANNUAL PENNSYLVANIA 
FARM SHOW 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the 106th Annual Pennsylvania 
Farm Show, the largest indoor agri-
culture show under one roof in the 
country. 
Each year, I have the privilege to 
tour the Pennsylvania Farm Show 
Complex, meet with commodity groups 
and industry leaders, and host a public 
listening session. 
I thank those who joined me in 2022: 
Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation 
Members Congressman KELLER
and 
Congressman MEUSER, and House Agri-
culture Committee’s Subcommittee on 
Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and 
Credit, 
Ranking 
Member 
MICHELLE 
FISCHBACH—all strong allies of the ag-
riculture community. 
I also thank Pennsylvania’s Sec-
retary of Agriculture, Russell Redding, 
for his participation, and the farmers 
and ranchers and producers we visit 
with for sharing their concerns, voicing 
their questions, and more importantly, 
clothing and feeding our great Com-
monwealth, country, and world. 
I know there is no experience that re-
places the value of meeting with our 
producers face to face. The Pennsyl-
vania Farm Show truly does bring to-
gether so many different people in the 
ag community on the local, State, and 
Federal level. It is an event like no 
other. 
f 
AMERICA’S ECONOMIC COMEBACK 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the economic come-
back we are seeing in Ohio and across 
our Nation. 
In April of 2020, before the Biden ad-
ministration took office, America’s un-
employment rate was nearly 15 per-
cent. With Democrats in charge, that 
rate is down to 3.9 percent, millions of 
jobs across our country. Under Presi-
dent Biden’s and our Democratic Con-
gress, we passed the American Rescue 
Plan to prevent communities, univer-
sities, hospitals from going bankrupt, 
to keep police officers and firefighters 
on the job, and put our people back to 
work. And indeed, last year, 2021, 6.4 
million new jobs were created across 
our country—an unprecedented num-
ber. That is a wow by any measure. 
And 100 percent of Republicans voted 
‘‘no’’ on the rescue bill. 
Now, thanks to the Jobs and Infra-
structure Act, Democrats just passed 
billions of dollars, and good construc-
tion jobs are going out across this 
country to rebuild roads, bridges, air-
ports, renewable energy, next genera-
tion manufacturing, and keep the 
progress moving. And guess what, 94 
percent of Republicans voted ‘‘no.’’ 
I say thank you to the Biden admin-
istration. Thank you to the Demo-
cratic party for picking this country 
up during the worst pandemic in a cen-
tury.

CONGRATULATING 
DAVID 
H. 
ESTES ON HIS APPOINTMENT AS 
PROSECUTOR 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
David Estes on his appointment to be 
the new top prosecutor for the South-
ern District of Georgia. 
David has been the Acting U.S. At-
torney since February of 2021. In 2018, 
David joined the U.S. Attorney staff as 
the First Assistant U.S. Attorney for 
the Southern District. 
David began his career in 1997 with 
the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, 
violent crimes division, as a violent 
crimes prosecutor. David also recently 
retired from the military with 34 years 
of experience under his belt. 
From 2004 to 2005, David was deployed 
to Iraq with the 122nd Corps Support 
Group where he served as the deputy 
staff judge advocate and chief military 
justice. 
He has been awarded the Bronze Star 
for his service in Iraq. And in 2013, he 
was promoted to colonel and continued 
his service to our country as staff 
judge advocate for the 167th Theatre 
Sustainment Command. 
Twice, David was awarded the Legion 
of Merit medal for his accomplish-
ments, and we are very excited to have 
him and his experience.

Daniel, Mr. Brian Daniel, who prides 
the company’s success on his family’s 
decision to focus on people. 
It is no wonder that his business in 
Hall County enjoys numerous acco-
lades, such as one of the ‘‘Best Places 
to Work’’ award, in addition to other 
awards recognizing the company’s re-
markable 
projects, 
including 
being 
named one of the ‘‘Top Contractors in 
the Southeast.’’ 
While Carroll Daniel Construction 
has strong roots in Gainesville, the 
company has built some of the most 
impressive buildings across northeast 
and southeast Georgia. Some of its 
well-known projects include the ob-
servatory on Brasstown Bald and La-
nier Technical College. Additionally, 
the Carroll Daniel Construction Com-
pany had the incredible privilege of 
pouring the concrete for the launching 
pad at the Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida. 
I am truly honored to represent such 
an outstanding family-owned business 
that improved the communities in 
Georgia’s Ninth District one project at 
a time. 
Congratulations, Carroll Daniel, on 
75 strong and successful years. May you 
have many more to come. Thank you. 
Soli Deo gloria.

RECOGNIZING 100TH BIRTHDAY OF 
COLONEL BUD ANDERSON 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a great Amer-
ican hero, World War II triple ace 
fighter pilot and a man I am lucky to 
know and call a friend, Colonel Bud 
Anderson. 
Colonel Anderson will be turning 100 
on January 13, just a few days from 
now. 
Bud is a California native, born in 
Oakland, California, and he grew up on 
a farm near Newcastle in Placer Coun-
ty in north California. He learned to 
fly when he was only 19 years old and 
joined the U.S. Army as an aviation 
cadet shortly after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor in 1941. 
Bud was decorated 25 times during 
his successful 30-year military career. 
He is the highest scoring living U.S. 
fighter ace and the only surviving U.S. 
triple ace. 
Bud has certainly impacted me and 
my staff as a friend and as a person in 
the community in Placer County with 
his leadership and his all-around kind-
ness as a person of such heroic status. 
I met him over a decade ago and had 
a chance to do various events with 
him, including a statue dedication for 
him. I watched him receive the Con-
gressional Gold Medal as an elite group 
of American fighter aces. One of my fa-
vorite memories was with him at an air 
show when a P–51 Mustang, which he 
flew in World War II in Europe, flew by. 
Really, it is the sound of freedom. 
Congratulations and happy birthday, 
Colonel Bud. God bless you.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO JOHN 
MADDEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 4, 2021, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of the Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to one of our 
Nation’s most beloved and revered 
sports figures, John Madden. Since his 
passing in late December, words such 
as ‘‘legendary’’ and ‘‘iconic’’ have de-
servingly been used to describe John 
Madden. 
Residents of Pleasanton and the Tri- 
Valley region I represent in Califor-
nia’s 15th Congressional District had 
the privilege of knowing John as a de-
voted and down-to-earth husband to 
Virginia, father to Mike and Joe, and a 
fixture at his grandchildren’s games 
and throughout the community. 
John Madden was simultaneously a 
larger-than-life Hall of Fame coach and 
broadcaster but also someone you 
could hang with and have a cold Miller 
Lite with at the Outback Steakhouse 
in Dublin after his grandson’s football 
game, bump into at Ace Hardware on a 
Saturday afternoon looking at power 
tools, or join for ham and eggs after 
mass on a Sunday morning at Vic’s All 
Star 
Kitchen 
on 
Main 
Street 
in 
Pleasanton. 
While our Nation mourns his passing 
at the age of 85, the loss is particularly 
felt in the Tri-Valley community we 
share. 
Whether you were from an older gen-
eration of fans that simply knew him 
as ‘‘coach’’; my generation of fans that 
connected with him as ‘‘John’’ from his 
years in the broadcast booth, hosting 
SNL, and starring in commercials; or 
the younger generation who simply 
knew him as ‘‘Madden’’ from the video 
game, it can be stated that few if any 
individuals have had a greater impact 
on football and popular culture in the 
last 50 years. 
It is rare to find someone who con-
nected with so many generations over 
so many different mediums. In fact, 
New England Patriots head coach, Bill 
Belichick, recently marveled at his 
success 
at 
coaching, 
broadcasting, 
commercials, video game planning, and 
real estate, stating that while most of 
us make an impact with one successful 
professional career, John Madden had 
five of them. 
It 
doesn’t 
appear 
that 
Coach 
Belichick was aware of Madden’s pro-
ficiency as a restaurant owner, grape 
grower, and almond farmer. For those 
scoring at home, that is actually— 
boom—eight successful careers that 
John Madden had. 
Yet, in the end, as NFL Commis-
sioner Roger Goodell stated, Madden 
‘‘was football.’’ That was his passion. 
Simply put, John Madden made foot-
ball and the NFL what it is today. 
Hired by the Oakland Raiders in 1969 
at the age of 32 as the league’s young-
est coach, Madden was on the sidelines 
during a transformational time in the 
NFL. He posted a 103–32–7 regular-sea-
son record, which is still the highest 
winning percentage for a coach with 
100 or more games coached in NFL his-
tory. 
Despite their reputation as free-spir-
ited renegades, Madden’s teams never 
had a losing season in his 10 years at 
the helm, and he led them to a Super 
Bowl victory in 1977. Beyond the num-
bers, many of Madden’s games actually 
have names. Whether it was the ‘‘Im-
maculate Reception,’’ ‘‘Ghost to the 
Post,’’ ‘‘Sea of Hands,’’ or ‘‘Holy Roll-
er,’’ never has one coach been involved 
with so many instant, iconic classics of 
a golden era of football. Madden never 
hid his emotions on the sidelines and is 
featured in many of the game’s lasting 
images. 
After retiring from football in 1978, 
Madden quickly became one of the 
greatest ambassadors the sport of foot-
ball has ever known. He moved to the 
broadcast booth to become the most 
popular commentator in all of profes-
sional sports. 
Madden would describe his teaming 
with his longtime broadcast partner 
Pat Summerall ‘‘like the day that pea-
nut butter met jelly.’’ He won 16 
Emmys sharing his insights, humor, 
and love for the game of football while 
working for every major network. He 
also lent his name to the popular foot-
ball 
game 
‘‘Madden 
NFL,’’ 
which 
ranked among the top-selling titles of 
all time. 
During that time, it would be hard to 
argue that any person did more for the 
growth of the popularity of football. 
Players and fans knew that if Madden 
was calling their game, it was the big-
gest and best game of the week. 
Madden’s enthusiasm for football 
through the television set inspired pas-
sion, while his voice also literally 
taught the game of football to millions 
of kids through their video game con-
troller. 
Despite 
many 
of 
the 
other 
descriptors of John Madden, one that I 
like to use is ‘‘teacher’’ because I don’t 
feel that anybody has taught the game 
of football to more people over the 
years in his capacity as coach, broad-
caster, and video game producer than 
John Madden. 
John Madden was that rare commu-
nicator who was both a teacher and en-
tertainer. 
He 
innovated 
both 
the 
telestrator and the yellow ‘‘line to

gain’’ for first downs that is standard 
for every broadcast today. 
Madden 
also 
educated 
audiences 
about the intricacies of football and 
communicated in a straightforward 
manner and plain language that every-
one could easily understand. He never 
overcomplicated things, but his anal-
ysis touched the football novice as 
much as the die-hard fan just the same. 
He was truly authentic. I can tell 
you, what you saw on TV is what you 
would see in real life. 
Like any great teacher, Madden was 
in a never-ending quest to learn about 
his subject and to perfect his craft. 
Whether it was analyzing freshman 
football games that his son coached at 
Foothill High School, watching game 
film, attending his grandson’s prac-
tices, talking to coaches, facilitating 
production meetings, his preparation 
was unparalleled. He had a lot of time 
to prepare as he traveled the country 
to and from games coast to coast, first 
on Amtrak trains and later the Madden 
Cruiser bus. 
John Madden loved people, and the 
people loved John Madden. John Mad-
den stopped throughout 48 of the conti-
nental United States at a number of 
diners, drive-ins, and dives before that 
was even a TV show, and he shared his 
story and countless meals with hun-
dreds and thousands of Americans. 
Speaking of meals, Madden became a 
part 
of 
every 
American 
families’ 
Thanksgiving tradition as he would 
broadcast a game every year from 1980 
to 2009. He literally termed the meal 
‘‘turducken,’’ a combination of turkey 
stuffed with duck stuffed with chicken. 
Even as his health declined in recent 
years, he would still raise money at 
home to support high school football 
programs throughout his hometown re-
gion of the Tri-Valley as well as var-
ious local charities through the annual 
Madden-Mariucci Bocce Tournament. 
He also continued to advocate for 
measures to increase safety in the 
game of football that he loved so much, 
with a focus on youth football. 
Whether you talk about his coaching 
career, 
broadcasting 
career, 
video 
games, or various commercials, his 
greatest legacy to those who knew him 
was that he achieved national fame but 
remained one of us. He stated at his 
Pro Football Hall of Fame induction in 
2006 that he never worked a day in his 
life and that he was one of the luckiest 
men alive. 
But the lucky ones are all of us who 
had the privilege of laughing, learning, 
and sharing his passions for football 
and life. 
The first time I met John Madden 
was about 10 years ago. We were at a 
barbecue in a friend’s backyard. He 
said to me: ERIC, things are pretty 
screwed up back there in Congress. 
He didn’t use the word ‘‘screwed.’’ I 
looked at him and said: Coach, I will 
try to do better. 
He said: Do better. Just try to find 
the deals. 
Things have been pretty tense around 
this place over the last 10 years, but I 
am happy that I am about to yield 
right now to my friend, RODNEY DAVIS 
of Illinois, a Raiders fan. 
Coach, I don’t know how many deals 
we can find right now, but RODNEY and 
I have a deal today that we think you 
are the greatest. We think you have in-
spired millions. The game of football 
and the country is better because you 
coached it, and you taught all of us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS), my Republican friend. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and 
colleague from California. It was 10 
years ago when we all came in as 
brand-new freshmen. One of the first 
questions I asked any of my colleagues 
from the State of California when I got 
here was: Are you a Raiders fan? 
Today, we are all Raiders fans, but 
just so everybody knows, he is a 49ers 
fan. That is okay. 
As my friend says, there is a lot of 
disagreement in this place. He and I 
don’t agree on a lot of issues that are 
coming in front of this institution dur-
ing this week or the upcoming weeks 
or, frankly, the past few years. But we 
are here all together to celebrate the 
life of a man who had an impact on all 
of us in this great Nation, especially on 
a young Raiders fan who became that 
Raiders fan when I lived in the State of 
Iowa. 
Anyone who knew me as I was grow-
ing up knows that there is only one 
football team that I root for, and that 
is the Oakland Raiders, then the Los 
Angeles Raiders, then the Oakland 
Raiders, and now the Las Vegas Raid-
ers. 
Most people in this country know 
John Madden as that broadcaster. This 
is the guy who actually broadcast pro-
fessional football games on every sin-
gle television network. What a feat 
that is. People knew him for being 
afraid to fly and driving a bus, talking 
about food, and writing with the little 
scribbler pen on the screen. What they 
don’t know about John Madden is that 
his life was football before he became 
that broadcaster. 
He helped make my life about foot-
ball because, one day on January 9, 
1977, my family, as I was 7 years old, 
sat down to watch the Super Bowl. It 
was the first football game I had ever 
watched in my life. 
b 1500 
Now, many people who know me are 
not going to be surprised by this. Ev-
erybody else in my house was rooting 
for the Vikings, so I had to be obsti-
nate and say: I guess I am going to root 
for the Raiders. 
What I saw in that game was some-
thing that I still have never forgotten. 
I didn’t know who John Madden was, 
but I learned about what he meant to 
that team. All I knew was there was a 
great team led by a great quarterback, 
Ken Stabler, whom John Madden al-
lowed to call his own plays. 
Madam Speaker, can you imagine 
that in today’s day and age, allowing 
the quarterback to call their own 
plays? 
Bill Belichick probably is having a 
seizure right now thinking about that. 
There is no way they are going to let 
people call their own plays. But John 
Madden believed in his players, and 
those players believed in him. They 
went out there, and they did their job 
that day. 
I was hooked, watching Jack Tatum 
knock Sammy White’s helmet off in an 
incomplete pass. I knew when I got to 
play football, I had to play defensive 
back. That was the coolest thing I had 
ever seen in my life. Ever since that 
day, there were Raider shirts, Raider 
pajamas, and Raider helmets. I actu-
ally still have my first one that I used 
to use in grade school, and it still has 
No. 30 on the back because my hero 
growing up was Mark van Eeghen, the 
fullback for the Raiders. 
My good friend and colleague BUR-
GESS OWENS, who played on the next 
Super Bowl team, not for Coach Mad-
den, but for Coach Flores, actually has 
promised me a chance to meet Mr. van 
Eeghen, so I am going to take him up 
on that. But to hear BURGESS
talk 
about stories of being a Raider, it is 
what John Madden, Al Davis, and the 
Al Davis family built and the entire 
Raiders organization built that made 
players want to come to Oakland and 
be a part of that winning atmosphere. 
John Madden helped create that win-
ning atmosphere. Players like Ken Sta-
bler, 
Mark 
van 
Eeghen, 
BURGESS 
OWENS, Jack Tatum, George Atkinson, 
Otis 
Sistrunk, 
Dave 
Casper, 
Fred 
Biletnikoff, Cliff Branch, you name it, 
Madam Speaker, they were there, and 
they created that atmosphere. 
But they needed a leader, and that 
leader in the 1976 season leading up to 
January 1977 was none other than John 
Madden, a great coach, a Hall of 
Famer. And from what I hear—because 
I never had the great chance to meet 
him—he was just a great person. 
As time has worn on, I have gotten to 
know people in the Raiders organiza-
tion, and they epitomize the same val-
ues John Madden did. When you look 
at what is happening right now with 
the leadership of Mark Davis; the presi-
dent of the team, Dan Ventrelle, my 
good friend; and so many others, they 
are taking that same John Madden at-
titude. We saw what happened on Sun-
day 
when 
they 
willed 
themselves 
through great players and great leader-
ship into the playoffs. 
I know John Madden’s family lit the 
flame that day in honor of Al Davis, 
and that flame was also lit that day in 
honor of John Madden. I am so glad the 
Raiders had a victory. I wish them 
well. 
Go Raiders. This week, beat the Ben-
gals. And let’s never forget the impact 
of John Madden. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Illinois for that 
very personal tribute. I grew up the 
only 49ers fan in an all-Raiders house-
hold, so there is a lot of influence there 
on me, and rightfully so.

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. SWALWELL. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Weren’t the Raider fans Republicans, 
too? 
Mr. SWALWELL. Yes, of course. And 
I was the only Giants fan in an all-A’s 
household, the only 49ers fan in an all- 
Raiders household, and the only Demo-
crat in an all-Republican household, so 
outnumbered in every way. But my 
mom and dad loved John Madden in the 
way you just described him because of 
what he taught all of us. 
I thank the gentleman for coming 
down with his helmet, and I think we 
are all rooting for a Raiders win this 
weekend. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league from the Central Valley of Cali-
fornia, who I believe will tell us that 
Mr. Madden had almond orchards in his 
district. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. COSTA). 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend and colleague ERIC 
SWALWELL, RODNEY DAVIS, and JERRY 
MCNERNEY. I think we are all here to 
celebrate a life well-lived. 
Coach John Madden had such an ex-
traordinary career in so many different 
areas that I think reflected, with all of 
that fame and all of that success, a 
common touch, a common touch that 
we honor today. 
I don’t think there is anything dif-
ficult about being a Raider fan from 
California and being a 49er fan because 
the Raiders played in the AFC and the 
49ers played in NFC. I think we have 
had a good run here for many decades 
because of those two incredible fran-
chises. The same could be said for the 
San Francisco Giants and the Oakland 
A’s. 
But as a kid, John Madden was a hero 
of mine. He actually started in a very 
humble way playing at Cal Poly. Cal 
Poly’s program was a smaller colle-
giate program in those days. 
Sadly, there was a plane crash in 1961 
that took place. Madden was able to 
avoid that disaster. I think that prob-
ably brought about his fear of flying 
for the rest of his life. But he never for-
got Cal Poly, and he continued to sup-
port the university as he supported so 
many worthwhile causes, whether it 
was athletics in Pleasanton and East 
Bay or whether it was other important 
efforts. 
As my friend noted, I don’t know 
whether his record will ever be topped, 
with 103 victories, 32 losses, and 7 ties, 
a regular-season record, and the young-
est coach to win a Super Bowl. 
What a lot of people don’t realize, 
Madam Speaker, unless you are from 
California, is the San Joaquin Valley 
that I have the honor and privilege to 
represent has always had a large group 
of Raider Nation fans there. Tom Flo-
res, who was born in Fresno and raised 
in Sanger, the first Hispanic quarter-
back in the NFL, was succeeded by 
Daryle Lamonica, who was at Clovis 
and was a quarterback for the Raiders. 
I think the Raiders have something 
that they really focus on, and they 
want their quarterbacks from the val-
ley because Derek Carr is a Fresno 
State guy and, of course, had that 
great victory Sunday. We hope that 
continues through the post-season. 
I was talking to Coach Flores, who 
was just inducted into the Hall of 
Fame—long overdue. Coach Flores was 
a valley guy. After he quit, after he re-
tired as quarterback, he came back to 
the Raiders and coached as an assist-
ant coach with Tom Flores. He talks 
about what kind of atmosphere Coach 
Madden had in the Raiders organiza-
tion, and the players loved him. He 
said that when you have assistant 
coaches, you have rivalries, and you 
have coaches who want to then move 
on to become their own head coach. 
But he said that Madden had a great 
way. They would sometimes argue a 
difference on a game plan, but Coach 
Flores said that, in his opinion, Coach 
Madden, over the years and decades 
that he played in the NFL and coached, 
was a great game-day coach. In other 
words, the players not only trusted and 
had faith in him, but when they devel-
oped the plan to go out on that field on 
that Sunday afternoon, as the dynam-
ics were changing and shifting, Mad-
den’s focus on the ability to be flexible 
and to make those adjustments were a 
large degree of his success as a head 
coach. 
From one Hall of Fame head coach to 
another Hall of Fame head coach, I 
think 
that 
is 
an 
incredible 
com-
pliment, and it reflects both on Coach 
Tom Flores and Coach John Madden. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t talk 
about the person who I think a lot of 
people know today, and that is Coach 
Madden, the man with a common 
touch. In his multitude of successes, he 
got involved in valley agriculture and 
got to know a number of my good 
friends in Merced in the area where he 
farmed grapes and almonds. Dan Fiahlo 
and a lot of the folks there used to love 
to get together with Coach Madden as 
well as with Dominic Mercurio from 
Cafe Fina on Fisherman’s Wharf in 
Monterey. 
What did these gentlemen all have in 
common? 
First of all, Coach Madden would be a 
guy you would be attracted to because 
of his larger-than-life personality. But 
they loved the common touch. They 
loved the ability to grow things that 
people could consume, whether it be al-
monds or whether it be grapes, and the 
appreciation of the hard work it took 
to put that food on America’s dinner 
table every night. So the love of food, 
for people who understood Coach Mad-
den, was really part and parcel with his 
friends. 
There was a card game for 27 years 
that Dominic Mercurio and Dan Fiahlo 
and others participated in, a legendary 
card game apparently that one could 
only hope to be a part of. Of course, 
both Danny and Dominic loved to cook 
and 
were 
great 
barbecue 
extraordinaires, and Coach Madden 
would hang out at Cafe Fina where he 
first got to know Dominic for his leg-
endary chowder, which developed into 
a regular fixture, so when Coach Mad-
den was inducted in 2006, he asked res-
taurateur Dominic Mercurio of Cafe 
Fina, Danny Fiahlo, and their team if 
these folks would come back to do the 
barbecue. You have thousands of people 
for the Hall of Fame induction in Au-
gust, but Madden had his plan, and 
they fed over 500 people. 
And Coach Madden says: Look, we 
are going to do it this way. 
He is giving instructions. 
Everybody who comes, whatever they 
are going to eat, there is going to be a 
multitude of foods. There has to be 
enough for everybody, whether you 
want chicken, whether you want bris-
ket, sausages, whatever. 
What they did was, after they fed ev-
erybody, they had an abundance of food 
left over that they gave to the char-
ities, to the churches. 
But that is what Coach Madden did 
in all the things that he was a part of. 
If there was stuff left over, you give it 
back to other people who need it most. 
I think that there are a lot of reasons 
why we honor Coach Madden here 
today and his incredible, celebrated ca-
reer, but the common touch, the fact 
that whether he was in Los Banos, 
California, or in the upper crust, one 
might say, of Carmel-by-the-Sea, he 
was still the same person. He was 
Coach John Madden, whom you would 
love to have breakfast or lunch with, 
talk about football, talk about other 
things that were important, important 
to communities and neighborhoods, as 
he related to you as a Representative. 
I am honored today to celebrate the 
life of an American who made a dif-
ference, who made a difference in so 
many different ways. He touched so 
many people in so many different ways 
because he knew people, and he liked 
people. That was evident in terms of 
any capacity that you ever came across 
John Madden with. 
We celebrate that larger-than-life 
legend today. We see him as a role 
model who impacted people throughout 
California and throughout not only the 
professional football league and other 
professional 
sports 
but 
his 
under-
standing of collegiate sports because he 
came from that. His understanding 
that and making changes and pro-
tecting collegiate athletics was some-
thing that John Madden knew well. 
I 
thank 
Congressmember 
ERIC 
SWALWELL for allowing me to give my 
own thoughts about a person whom I 
will remember. 
I can only close by saying one thing: 
Coach Madden, God bless you, and 
thank you for all you have done. Go 
Raiders. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. MCNERNEY), who is my colleague 
from the bay area who represented

Coach Madden for many years before 
redistricting changed the districts in 
2012. JERRY MCNERNEY is my neighbor 
and friend. 
b 1515 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for allowing me to 
speak today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise and join my 
colleagues in honoring the late Pro 
Football Hall of Fame Inductee, John 
Madden. 
John Madden was a giant in the 
world of football who brought an appre-
ciation and an understanding of the 
game into the homes of Americans. 
Selected in the 21st round of the 1958 
NFL draft, Madden suffered a severe 
knee injury during his rookie training 
camp, ending his pro football playing 
career when it was just getting started. 
Undeterred by his injuries, Madden’s 
love for the game of football propelled 
him to pursue a coaching career. In 
1969, he was hired as the head coach for 
the Oakland Raiders, making him the 
youngest head coach in the NFL, with 
only 1 year of coaching experience. 
Now, somebody saw something to 
promote him to head coach in just 1 
year of coaching. As head coach, he 
amassed an incredible record of 103 reg-
ular season victories, with only 32 
losses in 10 seasons. That gave him the 
second-highest winning percentage for 
NFL coaches. 
Madden’s ferocious will to win would 
not be denied in Super Bowl XI, the 
first Super Bowl championship for the 
silver and black. 
While already a legendary Hall of 
Fame head coach, John Madden ce-
mented his legacy as an icon of the 
sport from the broadcasting booth, be-
coming the first sports analyst to have 
worked all four of the ‘‘Big Four’’ U.S. 
television networks, and earning an in-
credible 16 Emmy awards. 
With a career in professional football 
spanning 4 decades, very few have tran-
scended generations the way John 
Madden has, and his legacy will live on 
forever in the memories of players, 
fans, friends, and through the memo-
ries made by millions who played the 
best-selling 
Madden 
NFL 
Football 
game. 
On a personal note, I had the privi-
lege of meeting John Madden and, yes, 
he was kind, he was personable, and it 
is true, we all ate very well that day. 
Not everyone gets to make a dif-
ference to so many people in this life, 
and John Madden was one of those peo-
ple. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, it 
is very evident from the tribute today 
across the aisle, and across California, 
that we grieve Coach Madden’s loss, 
but we have all tremendously benefited 
as a country because he so humbly 
coached, 
and 
because 
when 
he 
interacted with everyday Americans, 
he treated everyone with respect, and 
he treated everyone the same. 
So to the Madden family, we grieve 
with you. And to Coach, rest in peace, 
to a great coach. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

A RESOLUTION TO HUMBLE OUR-
SELVES AND ENTREAT WISDOM 
FROM GOD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days to revise and extend their 
remarks and submit extraneous mate-
rials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a 
resolution. I do not offer this resolu-
tion on my own behalf. I offer it as a 
representative of the people of the 
United 
States, 
to 
formalize 
the 
unspoken 
sentiments 
and 
concerns 
that abound in our Nation right now. 
Any authority I have is given to me by 
the people. 
And this is what we believe: 
Our Nation is unique. It is distinc-
tive, 
exceptional. 
American 
exceptionalism is too often misunder-
stood to mean something that it is not. 
It does not mean justification to domi-
nate or condescend to other nations, or 
indulgent flattery to ourselves that we 
are better. It does not mean that we 
are a chosen people, or that cir-
cumstances give us privilege to cir-
cumvent law. Our Nation is bound by 
the same universal moral principles 
that must bind and shape the behaviors 
of all civilized nations. In this regard, 
we are all the same, as nations, and 
yet, we are different, very different in 
a very important way. 
It is not wealth or military power 
that makes us exceptional. It is not 
our institutions nor the genius of our 
written Constitution or our Bill of 
Rights; not directly. These are mani-
festations of something more funda-
mental and profound. 
Our exceptionalism is based on some-
thing else, a singular belief, a propo-
sition you might call it, a proposition 
underlying all legal and constitutional 
beliefs. Our assertions of human equal-
ity and unalienable rights: life, liberty, 
and the right to pursue happiness, the 
right to find meaning and purpose and 
value in our individual lives, derives 
from a single assertion—that life, given 
to us by Creator God, is the moral basis 
of the unshakeable bedrock of our Re-
public. 
That proposition, the thing that 
makes us distinctive, is that we believe 
a Creator God endowed us with rights. 
Not just us. Everybody, everywhere. It 
is a gigantic revolutionary belief, and 
it is a belief. It is our faith statement. 
It is what speaks to the soul of our Na-
tion. 
There are many great and ancient 
nations that believe in freedom as we 
do. Most countries in the world claim 
the rule of law and have written con-
stitutions. Many of us use the language 
of rights and equality and declare for 
human dignity. But none have a coher-
ent basis for doing so. We alone occupy 
that space. God gave us rights; made us 
in his image and, therefore, dem-
onstrated all human beings are created 
equal, even the unborn, from concep-
tion. The poor, the infirm, the old, the 
weak, all colors and kinds, all races, all 
of us, are endowed by the Creator 
equally because we are made in His 
image. 
Without 
this 
fundamental 
belief, 
rights become only social protocol, 
conventions, 
historic 
inheritances, 
creatures of state citizenship, class, 
identity and features of consensus. 
They become malleable and fading 
creatures in the capricious hands of 
willful men. 
But America is different. God en-
dowed us with rights, and that belief is 
either true or it is false. If it is false, 
then we Americans, among all man-
kind, are most to be pitied. The experi-
ment must fail. It cannot and must not 
succeed. 
But if it is true, then we have built 
our country on a foundation that can-
not be shaken, if we are true to it, we 
are anchored in the eternal bedrock of 
all truths. As Lincoln said: ‘‘As a na-
tion of free men we will live forever or 
die by suicide.’’ 
To those who are given much, much 
is expected. 
And somewhere, deep down inside or-
dinary Americans know this. It is the 
air that we breathe. 
Only we ourselves can end this great 
experiment. There are no external mor-
tal forces that can overcome the bul-
warks of that eternal truth. 
And therefore, what we believe mat-
ters, Madam Speaker. Our invisible im-
material beliefs are the strength of our 
national soul. The things that we hold 
on to and serve are the foundations of 
our institutions, our laws, our liberty, 
and the hope of our Nation. 
When the Founders established this 
Republic 250 years ago, and created the 
institutions that guide us, they were 
well aware that those institutions were 
insufficient in themselves to govern a 
free people. The lifeblood and the 
heartbeat of the Nation is moral char-
acter, not the institutions. Not the in-
stitutions, or even the laws them-
selves. For laws and institutions are 
corruption without the rectitude and 
wisdom of a moral, decent people. 
Without the people bracing themselves 
to wisdom and the holdfasts of char-
acter, our institutions have no power 
to preserving us. 
If the people ever lose their love of 
truth, justice, goodness, and the efflo-
rescence of beauty that flourishes in 
them, there can be no hope in the 
parchment barriers of a Constitution,

or the institutions created by it; no 
matter how noble that hope is. In ef-
fect, everything rises and falls in our 
Republic as a consequence of the char-
acter of the people. 
As a Nation, we live or die by the 
standards of our own moral character. 
The Founders knew this, but many of 
us know we are forgetting it. 
‘‘We have no government armed with 
power 
capable 
of 
contending 
with 
human passions unbridled by morality 
and religion. Avarice, ambition, re-
venge, or gallantry would break the 
strongest cords of our Constitution as 
a whale goes through a net. Our Con-
stitution was made only for a moral 
and religious people. It is wholly inad-
equate to the government of any 
other.’’ 
John Adams wrote that to the mili-
tia of Massachusetts. What he is saying 
is this: The power of the State is not 
secured by the power of arms. It is an-
chored in the honesty and decency of 
the people. 
Today, this may seem a quaint no-
tion. I hope it is not. But the Founders 
who experimented in government to 
create a just and free society under-
stood explicitly that freedom and jus-
tice are not the products of institu-
tions, but, rather, institutions that de-
fend freedom and justice are the prod-
uct of a moral people. 
Freedom cannot exist without moral-
ity. George Washington understood 
this. John Adams understood this. 
Abraham Lincoln understood this. Dr. 
Martin Luther King understood this. I 
believe this, not because they believed 
it, but because it is true. I believe that 
most Americans understand this. 
When we drift from the Creator, we 
drift from the source of our own lib-
erty. When we forget our duties to God, 
we forget our duties to each other. 
When we become proudful and lazy and 
forget the father of all rights, we be-
come orphans of oppression. We are 
lost without the guiding hand of the 
Almighty. 
It may seem that Congress is not the 
place to introduce an appeal to God. I 
disagree. Insofar as all our rights and 
all our institutions are based upon the 
presumption of a just and Almighty 
God, and since this Congress itself 
rests upon the foundation that our Cre-
ator gave us the right to govern our-
selves, to quote my hero, Abraham Lin-
coln: ‘‘It is altogether fitting and prop-
er that we do this.’’ 
It is precisely because of America’s 
distinctive belief that I rise in this 
House to offer a resolution to humble 
ourselves and entreat wisdom from 
God, the Father of all blessings and 
mercy; a resolution of contrition, pray-
er, and fasting; a resolution in the 
great tradition of our free people. 
We have, as His guidance many times 
before, a resolution to return to the 
wellspring of liberty and our rights; a 
resolution to depart from iniquity and 
entreat His guidance; a prayer that we 
remember Him as the Father of every 
good thing that we have, and every-
thing as a Nation and people we aspire 
to be. 
Whereas, We the People of the United 
States of America continue our search 
for a more perfect union and; 
Whereas, we are a people conceived 
in liberty and dedicated to the propo-
sition that all are created equal, yet 
like in the days of Abraham Lincoln, 
when he observed that ‘‘We have for-
gotten the gracious hand which pre-
served us in peace and multiplied, and 
enriched, and strengthened us;’’ 
Whereas, ‘‘We have vainly imagined, 
in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that 
all these blessings were produced by 
some superior wisdom and virtue of our 
own;’’ 
Whereas, we confess we are self-con-
sumed, prideful, and unloving, quick to 
point out the speck in another person’s 
eye while missing the log in our own; 
Whereas, we are trusting in our 
wealth and skill, and leaning on our 
own understanding; 
Whereas, we have become ungrateful, 
lovers of pleasure, stubborn, hard- 
hearted, divisive, and unforgiving; 
Whereas, we confess that instead of 
speaking of forgiveness, we cry out for 
vengeance. We have allowed the poi-
sonous root of bitterness to grow up 
and trouble us; 
Whereas, the global pandemic of 
COVID–19 has intensified fear, un-
knowns, chaos, and confusion; 
Whereas, the impact of lockdowns 
and isolations has been severe, further 
exacerbating the breakdown of mental 
health, families, communities, and our 
Nation; 
Whereas, we are divided, perhaps like 
we haven’t seen since the Civil War, 
when 
Abraham 
Lincoln, 
President 
Abraham Lincoln, by faith, prayed, 
saying: 
May we again devote ourselves to prayer 
and acknowledge as a people and as a Nation 
our dependence upon the overruling power of 
God. Let us confess our sins and trans-
gressions in humble sorrow, yet with the as-
sured hope that genuine repentance will lead 
to mercy and pardon; 
b 1530 
Whereas, by faith, at the 1787 Con-
stitutional Convention, when the out-
look looked grim, Benjamin Franklin 
appealed to the delegates and urged 
prayer, asking: ‘‘I have lived a long 
time, and the longer I live, the more 
convincing proofs I see of this truth— 
that God governs in the affairs of men. 
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the 
ground without his notice, is it prob-
able that an empire can rise without 
his aid?’’ and 
Whereas, during World War I and at 
the signing of the Armistice, President 
Wilson proclaimed: ‘‘Complete victory 
. . . God has indeed been gracious, let 
us thank him.’’ and 
Whereas, this year marked the 80th 
anniversary of the initial National 
Bible Week declaration made by Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt just weeks 
before the start of World War II; and 
Whereas, George Washington Carver, 
born a slave during the Civil War, tes-
tified in 1921 in front of the House 
Ways and Means Committee expound-
ing on the myriad of ingenious uses for 
the peanut transforming the economy 
and which had been revealed to him by 
faith as he regularly walked through 
the woods at 4 a.m., and 
Whereas, President John F. Kennedy 
said: ‘‘The guiding principle of this Na-
tion has been, is now, and ever shall be 
‘In God We Trust,’ ’’ and 
Whereas, Reverend Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., encouraged to us ‘‘Pray 
daily to be used by God in order that 
all men might be free,’’ 
Therefore, be it resolved by those as-
sembled, we pray that in this hour of 
our great need, our Sovereign God will 
come and do again as He has done in 
days gone by; we pray for a time of 
healing from our brokenness, broken 
lives, broken families, broken commu-
nities, and broken systems. 
We resolve to humble ourselves, pray, 
seek God’s face, turn from our wicked 
ways, and thank and praise the God of 
our ancestors who has given us wisdom 
and strength and who controls the 
course of events; and 
Therefore, it behooves us to call upon 
the people of our Nation to humble 
ourselves before our Creator and ac-
knowledge our complete dependence 
upon Him, to repent of our pride and 
selfishness, and to ask the Lord to 
break our hearts for the things that 
break His heart; 
That we may not miss hearing His 
voice, and that He will pour out His 
spirit, once again, on our Nation and 
leaders; and 
We proclaim a year of National Hu-
miliation, Fasting, and Prayer. What 
might God do in the next 365 days if we 
commit to reading His Word daily and 
praying together for our Nation? In our 
families? For the young generation, 
this generation in misery and despair? 
We are expectant that He will do im-
measurably more than all we could ask 
or imagine and that He will hear from 
heaven, forgive our sins, and heal our 
land. May He be as original with us as 
He has been with others. Amen.

THE FENTANYL CRISIS IN 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to come to the 
floor this afternoon about a topic I 
wish we didn’t have to address. This is 
the plague in our country of fentanyl 
and fentanyl overdoses that so many 
families throughout this country have 
had to deal with. 
Coming from Ohio, we have, unfortu-
nately, been on the front-end of the 
opiate crisis. We have been on the

January 11, 2022 
years old. Her life was tragically cut 
short because she took a fatal overdose 
of cocaine that was unknowingly laced 
with the synthetic opioid carfentanil. 
Carfentanil, for those of you who 
haven’t been paying close enough at-
tention to all of these issues, is 100 
times more potent than fentanyl and 
10,000 times more potent than mor-
phine. 
So we have young, talented, beautiful 
people—in this case, a high school stu-
dent—who had so much promise, so 
much life, so much personality. I speak 
with her mom often and listen to sto-
ries about and see pictures of this 
beautiful young woman. 
Now, her mom, Cindy, carries on her 
daughter’s legacy, providing peer-to- 
peer programming at local schools and 
in the local community. 
We failed Rachel. This country failed 
Rachel and her mom and her family 
and all of the families across this coun-
try. 
We thought we had at one point 
enough attention on the issue of 
opioids, on the issue of heroin, now on 
the issue of fentanyl. Then the pan-
demic came, and this issue has been on 
the back burner. 
My remarks here today on the floor 
of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, one of the greatest delib-
erative bodies in the entire world, are 
to try to bring attention to this issue, 
to try to scream from the rafters so 
that we don’t have any more Rachels, 
we don’t have any more families that 
have to experience the heartache, the 
tragedy, the gut-wrenching experiences 
that so many families have had over 
the past few years. 
This is something that we can do. 
Think about this: 80 percent of the 
overdoses in Ohio are from fentanyl. 
The fentanyl starts in China, it goes 
to Mexico to get processed, and then it 
comes over the border. So as a country, 
we have to focus—and I will give the 
Biden administration a credit. We have 
seen progress in this regard. We have 
seen progress. We have seen an increase 
in people getting busted at the border, 
which is appropriate, but we have a 
long, long way to go. 
We need an awareness campaign 
across the country so that young kids, 
who otherwise would make a simple 
mistake and now it ends their life, that 
they know, that their peers know, that 
their schools know. There is not a cor-
ner of Ohio, Madam Speaker, that I can 
go to that I won’t meet families who 
have experienced this kind of tragedy. 
It is incumbent upon us. As one of 
the co-chairs of the Addiction, Treat-
ment and Recovery Caucus, we have 
been dealing with this in a bipartisan 
way. We passed the Comprehensive Ad-
diction and Recovery Act, the CARA 
Act, in a bipartisan way. 
We know that there are so many 
issues we can fight about. There are so 
many issues we can argue about here in 
this body. But I hope and pray that one 
of them isn’t this issue that we need to 
address collectively here in the United 
States Congress. 
We need to, I think, begin by going 
back to the opiate issue, going back to 
the Sackler family, going back to all 
the profits that were made off of get-
ting so many millions of Americans 
hooked on opiates, hooked on pain-
killers, and merge that in with a bro-
ken economy where there is so much 
hopelessness in so many quarters of the 
United States, where so many commu-
nities 
have 
been 
disinvested 
in, 
deindustrialized, left to rot. Then you 
have families that are knowingly in-
creasing the amount of opiates, playing 
with the FDA, going through the loop-
holes, which is what the Sackler family 
has done. They need to be punished to 
the point where they don’t get the 
right to the deal that they want, 
Madam Speaker; they don’t get the 
right to the deal that they want, be-
cause that is how it has been in the 
United States. 
If you are a wealthy corporation, you 
can get away with just about anything. 
If you are a rich person in the United 
States, it almost doesn’t matter what 
crime you commit; you are going to 
get away with it. 
But, 
meanwhile, 
in 
Youngstown, 
Ohio; Steubenville, Ohio; Portsmouth, 
Ohio; or Akron, Ohio, it trickles down. 
It has been those communities who 
have suffered greatly, including Day-
ton, Ohio, because of this epidemic. 
Over the holidays, my wife and I were 
able to watch an amazing documentary 
on Hulu called ‘‘Dopesick,’’ with Mi-
chael Keaton, Rosario Dawson, and 
others, that went through the Sackler 
family approach to painkillers. It was 
set in Virginia. Michael Keaton is from 
western PA and a graduate of Kent 
State in Ohio. They were highlighting 
Virginia, but this is an issue every-
where, where these good and honest 
and decent people found themselves 
getting hooked because of the wealth 
and profits that one family wanted to 
earn on the backs of the American peo-
ple. 
So here we are today. We need to 
make sure that the Sackler families of 
the world are punished and put out of 
business, quite frankly, and we need to 
also make sure that we begin to take 
the bold steps we need to take to make 
sure that the Rachels and the other 
kids and the other people across this 
country, to the tune of a 100,000 deaths 
last year, because of fentanyl. 
So I believe we need to take a firmer 
stance. While I support what the Biden 
administration has done, we need to go 
a hell of a lot further. I believe we need 
to start having a conversation in this 
country, knowing that China knows 
that they are sending fentanyl to Mex-
ico that makes its way into the United 
States, that they need to be punished 
with tariffs. They need to be punished. 
They are killing our kids. This is kill-
ing our kids. 
We can’t just stand around. We need 
to take the money from the tariffs, 
support our border, support the cops 
who are on the beat in these different 
communities. We need to put that 
money towards addiction treatment, to 
make sure everybody can get better if 
they have got some issue, and we need 
to grow the economy in these commu-
nities. 
b 1545 
But we can’t just stand by and hope 
this problem goes away, because it is 
not. It will get worse, and there will be 
more families, more destruction, more 
hopelessness, more ruined lives. 
As we are trying to compete against 
China economically, we need to make 
sure that Rachel and these other 
young, bright minds are on the eco-
nomic field playing for the United 
States of America. That is what this is 
all about. 
So we have to have a whole-of-gov-
ernment approach. We have a whole-of- 
government approach when it comes to 
the pandemic, right? The only way you 
can have any success is when you have 
a whole-of-government approach. This 
means Federal, State, and local coordi-
nation. This means coordination with 
nonprofits. This means coordination 
with law enforcement. This means co-
ordination with the Border Patrol. 
This is about us all coming together. 
You can’t tell me we don’t have the 
imagination in the United States to 
figure this out. This is about making it 
a priority. 
What I am doing here tonight, and 
what many activists across the coun-
try are doing, is trying to get this back 
on the front burner because other than 
a few articles in the paper, it has been 
on the back burner. 
We need to make sure we increase 
the resources necessary to keep this 
garbage out of our country or to know 
who has it the second they bring it in 
here. We have to make sure all of our 
kids are aware that this could be put in 
cocaine or meth or something else and 
that if you have an issue with drugs, 
you can actually get the treatment 
that you need and that no one is priced 
out of the market so that they can get 
better and get healthy and become self- 
sufficient and become good citizens and 
members of society and off to the races 
we go to try to outcompete China be-
cause we care about our citizens. That 
is what this is all about. 
You are going to be hearing a lot 
from me in the coming weeks and 
months. We are building a coalition of 
the families around Ohio and across 
the country who want to begin to move 
this issue forward. 
I do want to take a minute or two to 
talk about the power of fentanyl. I 
mentioned carfentanil. But 1 kilogram 
of fentanyl—1 kilogram; 1—has the po-
tential to kill 500,000 people. 
The money that is being made off of 
this substance will blow your mind, 
which is why it continues to come over 
the border from China, from Mexico. 
Much of the fentanyl comes through 
the southern border that is being 
looked at by the cartels. A lot of the 
China-sourced fentanyl comes through 
the 
international 
mail, 
and 
some 
comes from China through Canada.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H39 
January 11, 2022 
As I said, fentanyl is responsible for 
80 percent of Ohio’s overdose deaths. 
Roughly 79 percent of meth, cocaine, 
psychostimulant overdose deaths in 
Ohio were from supplies contaminated 
with fentanyl. The pervasiveness of 
fentanyl contaminating other drugs 
has made overall fatality rates for all 
drugs much higher than before, and we 
are seeing it across the board. 
We have the STOP Fentanyl Act. We 
have legislation with ANNIE
KUSTER 
and 
others. 
There 
is 
a 
Manchin- 
Portman bill in the Senate, which per-
manently makes fentanyl-related sub-
stances a schedule I controlled sub-
stance. This is something that we have 
to address, and we have to address it in 
a bipartisan manner. 
I would just like to say, lastly, 
Madam Speaker, that these parents 
have been through the ultimate trag-
edy. Having to put one of your own 
kids to rest, there is no greater heart-
break. There is nothing worse that 
could happen to a parent. 
So I am pledging, and I know other 
Members are pledging, to keep up the 
fight because, as some of these parents 
have told me, there is nothing left to 
lose for them. These parents have had 
their hearts ripped out of their bodies. 
They live with the pain every day. 
They wake up in the middle of the 
night and open their eyes and hope it 
was a nightmare, open their eyes in the 
morning and hope it didn’t really hap-
pen, that they could walk down the 
hall and their kid would still be lying 
in their bed. 
There is nothing more inspiring than 
seeing these giants, these parents who 
are taking their pain, taking their ex-
perience, taking their heartache and 
are saying: We have to fight. We can’t 
let this happen to another parent, to 
another brother or sister, to another 
family member. 
People like Cindy started Rachel’s 
Angels, which is a group back in 
Akron, Ohio, and there are so many 
groups across the country that have 
sprung up because of these tragedies. 
We want to unite these groups. We 
want to take the fight to the American 
people, to Congress, here in the House 
and in the Senate, and get the re-
sources we need to make sure that 
these overdose deaths stop, that the 
companies producing these kinds of 
drugs get punished, that the people 
peddling this stuff get punished, and 
that we get the resources we need to 
keep this garbage out of our country. 
While this may be the first time this 
year that I stand up and speak on this 
topic, it will not be the last. We are en-
couraging everybody, Madam Speaker, 
to reach out to their Members of Con-
gress, whether they are Democrats or 
Republicans, and let’s get this issue of 
fentanyl deaths back on the front burn-
er of the agenda here in the United 
States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO AMERICA’S 
ABOLITIONIST HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and submit 
extraneous materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, today 
is a very special day. I want to thank 
my good friend and colleague, Con-
gressman BURGESS
Owens. BURGESS 
OWENS and I are leading the charge 
here in Congress to tell the courageous 
stories of America’s abolitionist he-
roes, particularly those from upstate 
New York. 
It was an honor for me to welcome 
Burgess recently, in October, to up-
state New York to tour our region’s sa-
cred abolitionist sites, including the 
Gerrit Smith Estate National Historic 
Landmark and the National Abolition 
Hall of Fame in Peterboro, as well as 
the home of abolitionist, suffragette, 
and true American heroine Harriet 
Tubman. 
Opposite me, there is a photo here of 
Gerrit Smith. This is a picture of 
Gerrit 
Smith 
from 
Peterboro. 
Peterboro is named after his father, a 
guy named Peter Smith, and I just 
wanted to tell a little bit about how 
this all happened in Peterboro, New 
York. I am sure a lot of people don’t 
know the history. 
It all kind of started with an aboli-
tionist named Reverend Henry High-
land, who told his good friend Fred-
erick 
Douglass, 
when 
describing 
Peterboro, New York—which, by the 
way, I am honored to represent here in 
Congress. Many people don’t even real-
ize this little hamlet of Peterboro, up 
in bucolic Madison County, which hap-
pens to be my mother’s home county, 
played a vitally important role during 
the abolitionist movement. 
This was in large part due to one of 
its 
most 
famous 
residents, 
Gerrit 
Smith. As I said, the little hamlet of 
Peterboro was named in honor of his 
father. 
Mr. SMITH was a successful business-
man and a committed philanthropist. 
He previously served this body, actu-
ally, as a Representative from New 
York’s 22nd Congressional District, the 
same district that I currently rep-
resent. He was also a three-time Presi-
dential candidate. 
Gerrit Smith always opposed slavery, 
but he firmly joined the political cause 
of abolitionism in 1835. He was at a 
meeting of about 600 abolitionists in a 
church in the nearby city of Utica, 
which is in Oneida County. Upon learn-
ing of the meeting, a violent mob 
stormed the church and disrupted the 
proceedings, forcing the abolitionists 
to flee. 
Smith realized then that he could put 
his wealth and property to use. He in-
vited the abolitionists to his home in 
Peterboro. A year later, he was elected 
president of the New York State Anti- 
Slavery Society. The rest, as they say, 
is history. We are going to tell you a 
little bit about that today with Con-
gressman OWENS. 
In Smith’s view, slavery was com-
pletely incompatible not only with our 
founding documents but also with the 
natural laws of God. We were born free, 
and no law or institution could take 
away another man or woman’s innate 
right to freedom. 
From 1835 until his death in 1874, 
Gerrit Smith dedicated his whole heart 
to 
the 
abolitionist 
cause, 
and 
Peterboro was his base of operation. 
Giants like Harriet Tubman, Frederick 
Douglass, 
William 
Lloyd 
Garrison, 
Elizabeth Cady—eventually Stanton, 
whose husband, Henry Stanton, was ac-
tually a cousin of Smith’s—spent con-
siderable time there, strategizing and 
mobilizing support. 
Gerrit Smith played a key role in 
funding abolitionist causes across our 
country. Smith maintained a lifelong 
friendship with Frederick Douglass and 
provided funding and other support to 
The North Star, which was Douglass’ 
abolitionist 
newspaper. 
In 
today’s 
terms, Gerrit Smith would be consid-
ered a billionaire, and he gave what 
then was $100 a month to Frederick 
Douglass’ cause to pay for his news-
paper, which in today’s dollars, with 
inflation, would be about $7,000 per 
month to make sure that this news-
paper was able to continue to thrive 
and flourish and inform people. 
In a letter from Douglass following 
Smith’s death in 1874, Douglas credited 
Smith’s generous support as the finan-
cial engine that kept his abolitionist 
movement going. 
Smith’s estate in Peterboro was also 
a stop along the Underground Railroad. 
As enslaved people made their way 
north to Canada, Smith would offer 
them shelter, food, and support. Exact 
numbers are hard to come by, but it is 
safe to say Smith bought and helped 
secure the freedom of hundreds of 
enslaved people from around the coun-
try. 
This is why Reverend Henry High-
land said: ‘‘There are yet two places 
where slaveholders cannot come, Heav-
en and Peterboro.’’ Peterboro was syn-
onymous with freedom. 
Just 
a 
short 
drive 
from 
Gerrit 
Smith’s estate in upstate New York is 
the home of another titan of the aboli-
tionist movement, the great Harriet 
Tubman. Like Congressman OWENS, 
this was my first visit to Harriet Tub-
man’s home in Auburn. I want to show 
you a little picture of mighty Harriet 
Tubman, who is an amazing figure. I 
may have to go back to some of these. 
This is a great photo of Congressman 
OWENS and me at Harriet Tubman’s

home in Auburn, New York, where we 
were able to tour and see where she 
lived and where she operated her Un-
derground Railroad, right in our own 
communities. 
This was an amazing experience. I 
was in awe of Harriet Tubman, her ac-
complishments, and her tenacity. She 
had every reason to be in despair. She 
was strong; she was compassionate; she 
was generous; and she was only 4’11‘‘, 
which is amazing. 
The home we visited was where Har-
riet spent her later years, after she es-
caped slavery in Maryland, served as a 
conductor of the Underground Rail-
road, and then a scout, spy, and nurse 
for the Union Army during the Civil 
War. 
Harriet lived for almost a century. 
She was 91, almost 92 years old. She 
was an indomitable force. She was the 
first Black woman to lead a combat as-
sault, 
organizing 
about 
150 
Black 
Union troops on a raid in South Caro-
lina. She later freed 750 enslaved people 
as part of that operation. 
She suffered from narcolepsy her 
adult life after being hit by a metal 
weight when she was a teenager. De-
spite this, she persevered. She brought 
at least 70 slaves to freedom on the Un-
derground Railroad and never lost a 
single passenger. 
b 1600 
At her core, Harriet was a woman of 
compassion. In her later years she 
helped so many who came through her 
home in Auburn providing them shel-
ter, medical attention, and love. 
Despite the obstacles she faced, Har-
riet Tubman never gave up, nor was 
she ever consumed by anger or cyni-
cism. She led with integrity and was 
incredibly resilient, and she is cer-
tainly an amazing role model for all of 
us. 
It was important to tell Gerrit 
Smith’s story and Harriet Tubman’s 
stories, and now more than ever we 
must understand our shared history 
and learn from those who came before 
us. 
Our great Nation was founded on the 
promise that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their creator 
with certain unalienable rights, among 
them life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. No other republic before 
ours guaranteed such rights to its citi-
zens. In fact, before America, there 
were no citizens at all, only subjects. 
Yet in the earliest days of our Na-
tion’s founding, it is clear we failed to 
live up to our ideals. We failed to end 
the slave trade or to free those who 
were tied down in bondage. While this 
grave mistake will forever be part of 
our history, so, too, will be the coura-
geous stories of Gerrit Smith, Harriet 
Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and so 
many more Americans of different 
races, creeds, and religions who fought 
for a better America. 
Gerrit Smith and Harriet Tubman 
personify the spirit of America, and 
their stories should be a lesson to all of 
us. Their tenacity, their relentlessness, 
and their pursuit of ideals are every-
thing that we strive to be as Ameri-
cans. 
As Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas recently said, While we as 
Americans have failed to live up to the 
ideals of the Declaration of Independ-
ence time and again, there is no time 
in our history when those ideals them-
selves have actually failed us. The Dec-
laration and its principles endure be-
cause they articulate a fundamental 
truth that all people are born free and 
equal. 
Like Gerrit and Harriet did as citi-
zens of this country we must commit 
ourselves 
to 
the 
great 
American 
project of making sure we live up to 
our ideals. These ideals are sacred, and 
the 
abolitionists 
who 
gathered 
in 
Peterboro changed the world and they 
were the authors of our future, and we 
must thank God that we have the free-
dom to fight every day to strengthen 
our institutions and make this a much 
more perfect Union. 
Madam Speaker, I want to end by 
thanking those who made our recent 
visit possible and welcomed Congress-
man OWENS and I on that cold day in 
October before I yield to him, but I just 
want to recognize these great people 
who spend and devote their life to this 
history. 
First is Norman Dann. He was one of 
our tour guides at Peterboro and the 
author of ‘‘Practical Dreamer, Gerrit 
Smith and the Crusade for Social Re-
form.’’ 
Alden Max Smith, another one of our 
guides, as well as the cabinet member 
of the National Abolition Hall of Fame 
and 
Museum, 
which 
is 
also 
in 
Peterboro. 
Dorothy Willsey, another fantastic 
tour guide and president of the Na-
tional Abolition Hall of Fame. 
John Becker, chairman of the Madi-
son County Board of Supervisors for 
meeting us there and also for making 
this all possible. 
Cliff Moses, vice-chairman of the 
Madison County Board of Supervisors. 
Mary Cavanaugh, city of Oneida, 
wards 1, 2, 3 supervisor, who also greet-
ed us there and toured with us. 
Yvonne Nirelli, the former supervisor 
of the Town of Lincoln, who also greet-
ed us and toured with us. 
Matt Roberts, city of Oneida super-
visor for wards 1, 2, and 3, another per-
son who came to tour with us and was 
fascinated again by this amazing little 
hamlet in upstate New York. 
Matthew Urtz, our Madison County 
historian, who was completely in-
trigued and so excited to welcome the 
great BURGESS OWENS, who is going to 
be talking a little more on this today. 
Karol Kucinski, trustee at the Na-
tional Abolition Hall of Fame and Mu-
seum. 
And Nell Ziegler, the President of the 
Smithfield 
Community 
Association 
and owner and manager of the Gerrit 
Smith Estate National Historic Land-
mark. 
For more information about the 
Gerrit Smith Estate and the beautiful 
hamlet of Peterboro, I encourage you 
to visit www.gerritsmith.org. 
I also want to thank Karen V. Hill, 
president and CEO of the Harriet Tub-
man Home, as well as our fantastic 
tour guides who shared their knowl-
edge and passion with us again on this 
beautiful cold day. 
There it is again, this photo of our 
tour of Peterboro. It was wonderful to 
have BURGESS OWENS there, a really 
special moment for all of us. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great 
honor that I yield to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. OWENS), who I think 
this was a great experience for him. I 
think he never realized what existed up 
in upstate New York. And that is why 
we want everyone in the world to know 
just how important it is that we learn 
our history and we celebrate everyone 
who had a path and who had courage 
and who had the tenacity and the bold-
ness to stand up for what was right 
against the grain at a very difficult 
time in our country. I have one little 
thing for you, too. I have a special Har-
riet Tubman pad for you I grabbed. 
Mr. 
OWENS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
A couple months ago, as Claudia 
mentioned, my good friend from New 
York’s 22nd District invited me for a 
tour of two of upstate New York’s his-
toric sites impacted by Harriet Tub-
man. Harriet has been one of my heroes 
since I was 12 years old in the seventh 
grade. 
This was my first visit to Peterboro. 
What a remarkable experience it was 
to see firsthand the property of my 
longtime hero, someone who once was 
the property of someone else. I encour-
age everyone who visits the northeast 
to make this stop as part of your trip. 
I thank my good friend for her invi-
tation and for sharing this time as we 
discuss courageous Americans who un-
derstood the blessing of freedom. 
I rise today to honor of the extraor-
dinary life and unmatched legacy of 
Harriet Tubman, one of the most nota-
ble abolitionists in American history. 
As many of you know, Harriet es-
caped the horrors of slavery and 
through her work during the aboli-
tionary movement overcame unspeak-
able odds to secure the dreams of fu-
ture generations. 
My 
great-great-grandfather 
Silas 
Burgess came to America shackled in 
the belly of a slave ship. He was sold on 
an auction block in Charleston, South 
Carolina, to the Burgess Plantation. In 
his youth, he escaped to west Texas 
along the southwestern route of the 
Underground Railroad. He later became 
a successful entrepreneur, starting the 
first Black church, the first Black ele-
mentary school in his town and pur-
chased 102 acres of farmland that he 
paid off in 2 years. 
There are thousands upon thousands 
of untold stories of slavery to success 
all due to courageous conductors like

the Underground Railroad though is 
something that most of us miss. It was 
total trust in faith between conductors 
like Harriet and the facilitators of the 
Freedom Railroad. Whether it was 
south to north or south to west, as 
with 
my 
great-great 
grandfather, 
White, Christian Americans took the 
great risk of reprisal from the preva-
lent KKK in their community as they 
opened up their barns, cellars, and food 
pantries to create a safe and secret 
route to freedom for over 100,000 slaves 
prior to the Civil War. 
I have been inspired by the story of 
the American heart since I was 12 years 
old, growing up in my proud southern, 
segregated Black community. 
Born enslaved in Maryland in 1822, 
Harriet spent her childhood as a nurse-
maid, field hand, cook, and wood cut-
ter. 
When Harriet was 12, it was reported 
that she refused to help an overseer 
punish another slave resulting in a se-
vere injury when a 2-pound iron weight 
was thrown at her head. This caused 
her to suffer seizures and bouts of un-
controllable narcolepsy throughout her 
life. 
Harriet married John Tubman, a free 
Black man, in 1844. 
After rumors spread that Harriet was 
about to be sold, she fled to Philadel-
phia, then to Baltimore after returning 
to rescue her parents, sister, and two 
children. 
Over the next decade, Harriet led doz-
ens of these trips rescuing more than 70 
slaves along the Underground Railroad. 
As the railroad’s most famous con-
ductor, it has been said that she never 
lost a passenger. In 1858, Harriet 
bought a small farm in upstate New 
York where her family resided, later to 
be named the Harriet Tubman Home. 
During the Civil War, Harriet served 
Union forces as a scout, spy, nurse, 
cook, recruiter, and laundress. Under 
the command of Union Colonel James 
Montgomery, Harriet became the first 
woman to lead a major military oper-
ation in the United States when she 
and 150 African-American Union sol-
diers rescued about 700 slaves in the 
Combahee Ferry Raid. 
After the Civil War, Harriet opened 
her home to serve orphans and the el-
derly. She joined Elizabeth Cady Stan-
ton and Susan B. Anthony in their 
quest for women’s suffrage. She be-
lieved in equal rights for everyone and 
lived a life of courage, serving others 
until around the age of 92. 
I often say that the Black American 
history is so rich because of the heroes 
who have come before us, heroes like 
Harriet Tubman, Gerrit Smith, Fred-
erick 
Douglass, 
Sojourner 
Truth, 
Lucretia Mott, and so many others who 
recognized injustice, strove to help 
their brothers and sisters, and dreamed 
of a world outside the chains of slav-
ery. Each focused on building pockets 
of freedom that would soon spread 
throughout our country. It was a move-
ment that has inspired untold millions 
around the world. 
Indeed, we all stand on the shoulders 
of these great people who came before 
us, but the Black community, particu-
larly my proud race, holds our ances-
tors especially dear. They fought hate, 
overcame the horrors of slavery, and 
on their backs built a world in which 
we can own and build our homes and 
businesses, get an education, worship 
our faith, vote, run for office, and 
stand on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, honoring the legacy of 
one of the most notable abolitionists in 
American history. 
What a difference men and women 
pursuing their dreams in a free country 
can make. It is our responsibility to 
never forget or allow history to be 
erased as to what we the people have 
done together over our 240-year his-
tory. This as we continue to resolve to 
grow together as a more perfect Union. 
I have just a few thoughts I want to 
leave you with before I conclude. And 
that is a little bit of the highlights of 
the good hearts of our American peo-
ple. It is our Nation’s mission state-
ment that ends with the idea that we 
can have not only second chances but 
as an imperfect Union that we can be-
come more of a perfect Union. 
I start with my great-great grand-
father Silas Burgess. To show what a 
more perfect Union looks like is the 
fact that he came to this country in 
the belly of a slave ship, lived through 
the evils of a plantation, and yet es-
caped by going west because of good 
Americans, 
German 
and 
Mexican 
Americans who opened up their homes 
and their barns and their fields to give 
him an opportunity to move forward 
and keep his hopes alive. And even 
though he saw the evils of being a 
slave, he saw the good hearts of these 
good Americans that led him to be-
come a Christian, led him to be able to 
forgive, to build and serve instead of 
destroy. 
I see the form of a more perfect 
Union with my dad in the fifties who 
came back from World War II and 
could not get his postgraduate degree 
in Texas because of Jim Crow laws, was 
able to go to Ohio State because some 
White administrator, who I will never 
know who that was, said yes and gave 
my father an opportunity to get his 
Ph.D., and again, to help form a more 
perfect Union. 
I experienced this myself in the six-
ties when going to the University of 
Miami I was the fourth Black student 
to get a scholarship in the most south-
ern school down south. At that time 
there was a commitment by the Presi-
dent, Henry Stanford, to end segrega-
tion and it allowed me to move forward 
based on my character versus the color 
of my skin. 
I saw a more perfect Union in the 
seventies when a Jewish owner of the 
Oakland Raiders, Al Davis, committed 
to ending the Jim Crow barriers of the 
NFL and put meritocracy above color, 
and we had the first Hispanic quarter-
back, the first Hispanic coach, the first 
Black coach, the first female CEO be-
cause meritocracy has no color. 
What we have seen in our country 
and we have to continue to remember 
is the power of we the people, the 
power of the team. We think about 
Harriet Tubman as a conductor, Fred-
erick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, 
Martin Luther King, all conductors. We 
have many conductors today through-
out our country, and at the same time 
we have many more people who built 
our freedom highways and railroads. 
We the people roll up our sleeves and 
give hope to others. We need to redis-
cover our history, remember the ha-
vens of Peterboro, places where Ameri-
cans across this country, regardless of 
skin color, came together to allow oth-
ers to have an opportunity to see what 
freedom is all about. 
We can see those experiences in 
Booker T. Washington in Tuskegee in 
the early 1900s. We can see that experi-
ments succeeded in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 
in the early 1900s of Black Wall Street. 
And we can see it today throughout our 
country. We see it here in this House. 
What we must remember is our past 
should give us hope for a much greater 
future, and we also must remember to 
sprint away from anyone who leaves us 
hopeless. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those great 
words and for bringing up so many peo-
ple. And, again, our community was so 
honored to have you there. 
b 1615 
To have you at Peterboro and to have 
more people discover and have this au-
dience around our country and the 
world watching know that there are 
great people out there that did care 
about the cause of freedom. You 
brought up Martin Luther King, and I 
always remember studying him when I 
was a college student, and just discov-
ering his great relationship with Gan-
dhi and talking about peace and peace-
ful protests and how important it was. 
And how that is a founding principle of 
our country. 
Just to have you there in Peterboro 
meant so much. Everyone in Peterboro 
was so excited to have you there. Peo-
ple are recognizing that there are peo-
ple that are not on everyone’s radar, on 
the national radar, but there are people 
that have done great things, that are 
doing it quietly but they are doing it 
for a great cause. 
And those little acts, like you just 
mentioned, the administrator that let 
your dad into Ohio State, you will 
never know who it was, but that person 
enabled us to have the great BURGESS 
OWENS here today. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, if I can 
add to that, because I think the most 
important thing about our Nation is to 
remember our history, to really under-
stand that we have within our hearts, 
because of our foundation, this desire 
to want others to succeed. We want to 
feel good that we have been part of 
something that makes a difference. 
And it is not just the 2000s, it is actu-
ally throughout our country’s history.

And to know what happened, again, 
from my great grandfather, throughout 
our history, again we can find those 
moments in which we have helped each 
other. We have all given some cre-
dence, something given back to this 
country, the more we know about that, 
the more we will feel better about who 
we are today and our vision for the fu-
ture. So we have to make sure we keep 
that in mind, for sure. 
Ms. TENNEY. I agree. I think we 
have to focus on the people who are 
helping us, not the people who aren’t. 
And I think that this is what we want-
ed to do today, and we are grateful to 
you to be able to focus on people who 
actually help, not the people tearing us 
down, the people trying to bring our 
country to its knees, but people trying 
to make us rise up and be better, and 
be a better America than we are today. 
And that is our striving for our future. 
That is what we want our children to 
be. We want America to be better for 
our children and our grandchildren. 
And I think by recognizing that there 
were great people in our past who have 
done amazing things who never got the 
recognition, but often those people go 
unnoticed. And I think that is why it 
meant so much for us to have you 
there. 
Madam Speaker, I urge anyone if you 
want to come up on a beautiful fall 
day, or you can come in the warm sum-
mer days, it is a little warmer—it is a 
little snowy right now—to come to 
visit Peterboro and meet with some 
our great docents, who I mentioned in 
my remarks, who are studying and un-
covering documents and trying to show 
the true history so we understand it 
and so we can learn from it. 
Even though I had been to Peterboro 
when I was younger—I knew about it 
when I was a kid because it was my 
mom’s home county—I never knew the 
depth of it, or I learned so much more 
just by that experience. And I am sure 
if I go again to the Abolitionist Hall of 
Fame, I think I would learn even more 
there. But just learning about Harriet 
Tubman and going to her house and 
being in the same room where you 
know that she was providing so much 
aid and comfort and love to people she 
didn’t know but people she believed in 
and knew needed to understand and 
feel that taste of freedom, just stand-
ing there with you and the people that 
worked there and how much it meant 
to them, they conveyed that sort of, 
you know, that wonderful feeling to us 
as well. 
So I feel like I just would love to 
have everyone come and have that ex-
perience. And anywhere else in the 
country, we would love to encourage 
our colleagues to come out and tell us 
about great experiences and great 
Americans that are out there that 
might not get the recognition. They 
might not be getting the clicks on 
twitter or Facebook or social media, 
but there are people out there doing 
great works and uncovering great her-
oism. 
Mr. OWENS. If I could add a little 
about Peterboro. This was, again, a 
new experience for me. And what that 
particular place represented for so 
many Americans, particularly Black 
Americans, was a place of hope. They 
knew that once they got to Peterboro, 
they were literally very close to Can-
ada, which was their, really, freedom. 
That was it. 
They could then know they weren’t 
going to be hiding and going through 
all the stealth and knowing they could 
be recaptured. So that hope is a big 
factor we talked about. And I hope that 
those that are listening to our con-
versation know that actually our coun-
try is built on that. 
What we have done so far today is 
talked about what our country is capa-
ble of because we have done it in the 
past. And the more hope we can give to 
our fellow Americans that this is a 
country, the best in the history of 
mankind, that we can serve each other, 
that we can build, not destroy, and 
that we can become a much better 
country because that is actually within 
our mission statement, to be a more 
perfect union. And we can do that, and 
that is what we have done, again, very 
successfully. 
I am just very excited to have this 
opportunity to spend this time with 
you. It was a great opportunity. I can’t 
wait to get back. If I can say, for any-
one who is listening, please check this 
place out. Harriet Tubman, as always, 
for many of us we know she is a hero, 
go to her place to see her property—a 
person that once was the property of 
someone else—her property and what 
she did and what she gave away to so 
many because she just loved the proc-
ess of service. It was a great experi-
ence, and I can’t wait to get back and 
check it out again. 
Ms. TENNEY. We can’t wait to have 
you back. 
And also, I just think about that last 
moment when we were in Gerrit Smith 
Estate, in the barn. We went back in 
the barn and we saw these conditions 
where horses and mules were put, and 
that they actually had to hide people 
in there. 
We came out of the barn, and there 
was this gleaming sunlight on us on 
that cold day. And I looked above, and 
there was a sign that said ‘‘Heaven in 
Peterboro,’’ the two places where the 
slaves were safe and symbolized free-
dom. 
So it was just an honor for me to rep-
resent the community. And then to 
have you standing there with that 
gleaming sunlight on us and knowing 
that so many people in our past, that 
was their gateway to freedom and gate-
way to finding a new life, I think it was 
a tremendous experience. We hope 
maybe you can come again and we can 
invite our colleagues and others to 
come and experience Peterboro. 
Mr. OWENS. I would love to. 
Ms. TENNEY. And Harriet Tubman’s 
home, of course. 
Mr. OWENS. If I could just leave one 
message as my last final word to those 
who are watching. This country is a 
place that has thrived because people 
can envision themselves doing much, 
much better. And we do that when we, 
the people, get together and we really 
put our hearts and soul into making 
sure our next generation is a much bet-
ter place than our time is, and we do 
that better than any other country. 
I am thankful for the opportunity to 
visit the home of my hero since I was 
12 years old, and that was kind of ex-
citing to hear that you were that close 
to the area and to have the invitation 
to come up and see it. So thank you so 
much for that. 
Ms. TENNEY. Yes, thank you. And 
what a great discovery it was, just sit-
ting on the floor of the House Chamber, 
BURGESS and I. And I said, you have 
never been to Peterboro? How about 
this? 
Who would think that I would be 
hosting a famous person like BURGESS 
OWENS, a hero in our communities, in 
my own little community, and that we 
would have that common bond with 
Harriet Tubman. 
But we are grateful. We are just 
grateful for you and your service and 
everyone here. And I just hope that my 
colleagues and anyone who wants to 
join Peterboro—again, I hate to do too 
much 
of 
a 
pitch—but 
go 
to 
www.gerritsmith.org. It is an amazing 
place. It is humble, but it is just majes-
tic and the accomplishments that were 
made in that wonderful place. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Mr. BURGESS, for joining us, 
and thank him for everything he has 
done, for standing courageously and 
boldly for our communities and for our 
country, and standing up for our Con-
stitution and freedom. Because that is 
really what is going to unite us. 
Let’s talk about what unites us, not 
what divides us. We have a lot of great 
history that can really bring us to-
gether in the future. And so I thank 
you. 
Mr. OWENS. Thank you so much. Ex-
actly the same. We have a remarkable 
freshman team. I am so honored to be 
serving with you at this point. Let’s 
keep this thing moving forward, for 
sure. 
Ms. TENNEY. Thank you so much. 
The honor is all mine. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 11, 2022 
No. 7 
Senate 
(Legislative day of January 10, 2022) 
The Senate met at 11 a.m., on the ex-
piration of the recess, and was called to 
order by the President pro tempore 
(Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To-
day’s opening prayer will be offered by 
Rabbi 
Moshe 
Feller, 
the 
director, 
Upper 
Midwest 
Merkos 
Chabad- 
Lubavitch, from St. Paul, MN. 
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Almighty God, Master of the Uni-
verse, the Members of this august 
body, the U.S. Senate, convene here 
today to fulfill one of the Seven Com-
mandments which You issued to Noah 
and his family after the Great Flood: 
the commandment that all society be 
governed by just laws. 
As stated in the book of Genesis and 
its sacred commentaries, You issued at 
that time the following seven laws: to 
worship You and You alone; never to 
blaspheme Your Holy Name; not to 
commit murder; not to commit adul-
tery, incest, or any sexual misdeeds; 
not to steal, lie, or cheat; not to be 
cruel to any living creature; and that 
every society be governed by just laws 
based on the recognition and acknowl-
edgement of You, O God, as the sov-
ereign Ruler of all humankind and all 
nations. 
Grant, Almighty God, that the Mem-
bers of the Senate constantly realize 
that by enacting just laws they are 
doing Your will. Almighty God, I be-
seech You today to bless the Senate 
and our entire Nation in the merit of 
two spiritual giants of our time and of 
our country, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak 
Schneerson of saintly blessed mem-
ory—the sixth Lubavitch Rebbe—and 
his 
successor, 
the 
Rebbe, 
Rabbi 
Menachem 
Schneerson, 
of 
saintly 
blessed memory. 
Tomorrow, the 10th day of the He-
brew month of Shevat, is the anniver-
sary of the transition of their leader-
ship. It is a day of reflection and action 
and one which should energize us to be 
God-conscious beings. Their holy mis-
sion continues through our acts of 
goodness and kindness, hastening the 
harmonious era of the messianic re-
demption. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morn-
ing business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Alan Davidson, of Maryland,

for Communications and Information. 
Mr. PETERS. I suggest the absence

clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
something disturbing is happening in 
Washington this week. A group of poli-
ticians are trying to set aside election 
results, overrule American voters, and 
break—break—our institutions to get a 
political outcome they want. 
I am speaking, of course, about the 
Senate Democratic leader and the rad-
ical left. The Senate Democratic leader 
is trying to bully his own Members 
into breaking their word, breaking the 
Senate, and silencing the voices of mil-
lions of citizens so that one political 
party can take over our Nation’s elec-
tions from the top down. 
In January 2021, a mob tried to in-
timidate and change the Senate, and 
they failed. In January of 2021, the Sen-
ate stayed true to itself, and it stood 
strong. 
But in January of 2022, some of the 
Senate’s own Members want to perma-
nently damage this institution from 
within. They want to shatter its cen-
tral feature. The Democratic leader is 
using fake hysteria—fake hysteria— 
about 2021 State laws to justify a power 
grab he began floating actually back in 
2019 and an election takeover that was 
first drafted in 2019. 
President Biden has spread so much 
misinformation about the basic facts of 
State voting laws that he was called 
out and debunked by—listen to this— 
the Washington Post. A sitting Presi-
dent of the United States who pledged 
to lower the temperature and unite 
America now invokes the brutal racial 
hatred of Jim Crow segregation to 
smear—to smear—States whose new 
voting laws are more accessible than, 
for example, Delaware. Ten days of 
early voting and excuse-only absentees 
in Delaware is just fine, but 17 days of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S124 
January 11, 2022 
early voting and no-excuse absentees in 
Georgia is racist Jim Crow? 
The Senate Democratic leader pre-
tends it is a civil rights crisis that 
Georgia has enshrined more early vot-
ing and more absentee balloting than 
his own State of New York has ever al-
lowed. This is misinformation. It is a 
Big Lie designed to reduce faith in our 
democracy, justify a top-down election 
takeover, and justify smashing the 
Senate itself. Some years back, a vet-
eran Democratic Senator explained: 
[The] nuclear option is ultimately an ex-
ample of the arrogance of power . . . [it] 
would transform the Senate from the so- 
called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers 
talked about . . . to a purer majoritarian 
body. 
That was then-Senator Joe Biden. He 
continued: 
At its core, the filibuster is not about stop-
ping a nominee or a bill, it is about com-
promise and moderation. 
Now, before President Biden abruptly 
reversed this position he held for dec-
ades, he was actually in very good com-
pany. Senator Robert Byrd of West Vir-
ginia, the legendary Senate institu-
tionalist, was this crucial tradition’s 
fiercest defender. The current Demo-
cratic leader has tried to invoke Sen-
ator Byrd in support of this push to 
vandalize the Senate. This is more mis-
information. Senator Byrd went out of 
his way to rebut Leader SCHUMER’s ar-
guments, years in advance. Here is a 
direct quote from Senator Byrd: 
Proponents of the so-called nuclear option 
cite several instances in which they inac-
curately allege that I blazed a procedural 
path toward an inappropriate change in Sen-
ate rules. They’re dead wrong— 
Said Senator Byrd— 
Dead wrong. They draw analogies where 
none exist and create cockeyed comparisons 
that fail to withstand even the slightest in-
tellectual scrutiny. 
That is how Senator Byrd felt about 
it. Down to his final public statements 
before his death in 2010, Senator Byrd 
was completely consistent: 
I oppose cloture by a simple majority, be-
cause it would immediately destroy the 
uniqueness of this institution . . . minority 
rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Senator Byrd, shortly before his 
death. 
That Democratic leader knew how to 
serve and protect the Senate. 
This Democratic leader wants power 
so badly he will misrepresent his own 
late predecessor if it helps him get it. 
Senator Byrd’s successor, the current 
senior Senator from West Virginia, has 
eloquently restated the very same 
points. Our colleague Senator MANCHIN 
published an op-ed explaining why 
‘‘there is no circumstance in which I 
will vote to eliminate or weaken the 
filibuster’’—Senator MANCHIN. 
He pointed out that finding com-
promise across party differences and 
differing regional interests was ‘‘never 
supposed to be easy . . . but it is the 
work we were elected to do.’’ He noted 
that current rules guarantee ‘‘that 
rural and small states and the Ameri-
cans who live in them . . . always have 
a seat at the table.’’ 
Our colleague also pointed out that 
the 60-vote threshold keeps Federal law 
durable and predictable: 
If the filibuster is eliminated or budget 
reconciliation becomes the norm, a new and 
dangerous precedent will be set to pass 
sweeping, partisan legislation every time 
there is a change in political control . . . our 
nation may never see stable governing again. 
This has been a key point for Sen-
ators on both sides going back genera-
tions. In his farewell address before re-
tirement, our former colleague, Lamar 
Alexander, put it this way: The Senate 
rules exists to ‘‘force broad agreements 
on controversial issues that become 
laws that most of us will vote for and 
that a diverse country will accept.’’ 
In other words, major changes need 
major buy-in. Otherwise, every policy 
would ping-pong wildly whenever the 
gavels change hands. 
This is a point which our colleague, 
the senior Senator from Arizona, has 
explained 
powerfully. 
As 
Senator 
SINEMA wrote just a few months ago, 
‘‘the 60-vote threshold . . . compels 
moderation and helps protect the coun-
try from wild swings . . . and radical 
reversals in Federal policy.’’ 
Sometimes the effect of the filibuster 
is to block bills outright. Republicans 
are using the tool to stop one-party 
election takeovers. In 2020, Democrats 
used it to kill Senator TIM SCOTT’s po-
lice reform bill. But as President Biden 
argued decades ago, the filibuster is 
about more than what gets blocked. It 
shapes almost everything the Senate 
actually does pass. It gives all kinds of 
citizens and all kinds of States a mean-
ingful voice in nearly everything. 
By breaking the Senate, this Demo-
cratic leader wants to silence the 
voices of millions and millions of 
Americans. He wants to throw whole 
regions of the country into a political 
power outage because those voters 
don’t agree with his radicalism. We 
will see which Senators have the cour-
age and the principle to put a stop to 
it. 
Finally, on a more practical level, I 
want to make something very, very 
clear. Fifty Republican Senators, the 
largest possible minority, have been 
sent here to represent the many mil-
lions of Americans whom Leader SCHU-
MER wants so badly to leave behind. So 
if my colleagues try to break the Sen-
ate to silence those millions of Ameri-
cans, we will make their voices heard 
in this Chamber in ways that are more 
inconvenient for the majority and this 
White House than what anybody has 
seen in living memory. 
Last year, the Senate passed major 
bipartisan legislation on infrastruc-
ture, on hate crimes, on government 
funding, on competing with China. 
Last 
year, 
Senators 
helped 
speed 
through noncontroversial nominations. 
So what would a postnuclear Senate 
look like? I assure you, it would not be 
more efficient or more productive. I 
personally guarantee it. 
Do my colleagues understand how 
many times per day the Senate needs 
and gets unanimous consent for basic 
housekeeping? Do they understand how 
many things would require rollcall 
votes, how often the minority could de-
mand lengthy debate? 
Our colleagues who are itching for a 
procedural nuclear winter have not 
even begun to contemplate how it 
would look. Our colleagues who are 
itching 
to 
drain 
every 
drop 
of 
collegiality from this body have not 
even begun to consider how that would 
work. 
If the Democratic leader tries to shut 
millions 
of 
Americans 
and 
entire 
States out of the business of governing, 
the operations of this body will change. 
Oh, yes, that much is true. But not in 
ways that reward the rulebreakers, not 
in ways that advantage this President, 
this majority, or their party—I guar-
antee it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later 
today, President Biden will be speaking 
in Georgia as part of Democrats’ effort 
to convince the American people that 
voting rights are under attack so they 
can justify their attempt to abolish the 
Senate filibuster to pass their partisan 
election legislation. 
A noted Democrat operative once fa-
mously said that you should never let 
a good crisis go to waste. He meant, of 
course, that a crisis could give you the 
opportunity to push things through 
that you might not be able to get done 
in the ordinary course of things. It is a 
lesson the Democrats have learned 
well. 
Last March, for example, Democrats 
used the cover of the COVID crisis to 
pass a so-called COVID relief bill that 
had very little to do with COVID relief 
and had a lot to do with expanding the 
role of government and providing pay-
offs to Democrat constituencies. 
But, unfortunately for Democrats, 
when it comes to election legislation, 
there is no crisis for Democrats to ex-
ploit, so Democrats have spent the past 
year busily trying to manufacture one. 
I say the past year, but Democrats 
have actually been claiming there is a 
voting crisis for much longer. 
The source of the election bill that 
we will likely vote on this week is H.R. 
1—election legislation that was first 
introduced by Democrats back in 2019. 
Back then, Democrats told us that our 
election system was broken and that 
we needed this bill to fix it. After all, 
a Republican had won the last Presi-
dential election and beat a favored 
Democrat candidate. Surely, surely, 
that meant our system was in trouble. 
But then the 2020 elections came along, 
and Democrats won the Presidency and 
a majority—albeit a narrow majority— 
in both Houses of Congress. Voter turn-
out was massive, and a Pew Research 
Center poll found that 94 percent of 
people found it easy to vote—94 per-
cent. So all of a sudden, it was pretty

January 11, 2022 
difficult for Democrats to claim that 
our system was broken. But they still 
wanted to pass their election legisla-
tion, so they came up with a new crisis. 
In 2021, a number of States passed up-
dates to their voting laws—partly be-
cause of the challenges and special cir-
cumstances that arose as a result of 
the pandemic. Democrats decided that 
these commonsense, mainstream up-
dates represented an unprecedented at-
tack on voting rights. 
Georgia, which was one of the first to 
enact voting legislation, has become 
the poster child for the Democrats’ 
campaign to convince Americans that 
their voting rights are in danger. 
So what terrible voter suppression 
measures are States imposing? Well, 
one provision of the Georgia law that 
has come in for a lot of Democrat out-
rage is its measure forbidding partisan 
political organizations from providing 
individuals with food or water within 
150 feet of a polling place. Yes, appar-
ently preventing partisan political or-
ganizations from providing lunch to 
voters threatens the very stability of 
our entire democracy. 
Now, nothing in Georgia’s law pre-
vents outside groups from providing 
food and water to individuals outside 
the 150-foot radius, and Georgia’s law 
explicitly allows nonpartisan election 
workers, as opposed to political groups, 
to make water available to voters. Of 
course, I am pretty sure any voter can 
bring his or her own food and water. 
But none of that has prevented Demo-
crats from suggesting that rules about 
food and water distribution at polling 
places represent a grave threat to vot-
ing rights. 
Ironically, the State of New York has 
a similar provision in its election law 
prohibiting any refreshment or provi-
sion to a voter at a polling place except 
if the retail value of what is given is 
less than $1 and the person or entity 
providing it is not identified. Yet I 
don’t see the Democrats traveling to 
New York to decry the threat to de-
mocracy posed by the New York Legis-
lature. 
After Georgia passed its voting law, 
President Biden got up and attacked 
the law for supposedly ending voting 
early to prevent working people from 
voting. He made that accusation re-
peatedly. The problem? There was ex-
actly zero truth to his claim. In fact, 
as the Washington Post’s Fact Checker 
column pointed out, ‘‘experts say the 
net effect of the new early-voting rules 
was to expand the opportunities to 
vote for more Georgians, not limit 
them.’’ 
That is from the Washington Post’s 
Fact Checker. Let me just repeat that: 
[E]xperts say that the net effect of the new 
early-voting rules was to expand the oppor-
tunities to vote for most Georgians, not 
limit them. 
The Fact Checker gave the President 
four Pinocchios—a rating the column 
reserves for ‘‘whoppers’’—for his false 
claim that the law was designed to 
keep working Americans from voting. 
I would also like to point out that 
not only is Georgia’s election reform 
law thoroughly mainstream, Georgia’s 
laws are actually more permissive in 
some respects than voting laws in some 
Democrat States. 
Georgia offers no-excuse absentee 
voting. The Democrat leader’s home 
State—Senator 
SCHUMER’s 
home 
State—does not. In fact, voters in the 
Democrat leader’s home State actually 
just rejected a ballot measure that 
would have allowed no-excuse absentee 
voting. I guess the Democrat leader 
thinks that those voters are trying to 
destroy our democracy. 
Georgia also has way more days of 
early voting than the Democrat lead-
er’s home State. So does Arizona, an-
other State that has come under fire 
from Democrats for updating its elec-
tion laws. Yet red States, according to 
Democrats, are the States attempting 
to suppress votes. 
It is also important to note that the 
Georgia law was written to address 
concerns from Republican and Demo-
crat voters, including concerns raised 
by Stacey Abrams-affiliated groups 
over the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial 
election. 
There is no question—no question— 
we should make voting easy and acces-
sible, but there are a lot of different 
ways to do that. States can have dif-
ferent requirements and still all offer 
ample opportunities to vote. 
Also, I think my Democrat friends 
need a little perspective check. There 
are countries where individuals would 
consider it a privilege to be able to 
stand in line to vote in a free election— 
even if someone didn’t provide them 
with food and water. 
Of course, no one wants voters to 
have to stand in long lines, and, in 
fact, Georgia’s election law will make 
it less likely that they have to. But 
Democrats’ dramatic claims that a 
long line or a lack of a drop box or, 
say, 9 as opposed to 10 days of early 
voting somehow threatens the right to 
vote in this country are nothing short 
of absurd. I have faith that Americans 
are capable of voting even without the 
Democratic Party providing them with 
a boxed lunch. 
There is no election crisis in this 
country. This last election—biggest 
turnout in American history in 120 
years. You have to go back to the year 
1900 to find a time when the election 
turnout in an American election was 
equal to or exceeded what we had in 
2020. What there is, is a partisan Demo-
crat election bill the Democrats have 
wanted to pass since long before the 
Georgia Legislature reformed their 
election laws because they think it will 
give them an advantage in future elec-
tions. You don’t have to take my word 
for it; more than one Democrat has 
openly admitted the Democrats want 
to pass a Federal election takeover be-
cause they think it will give their 
party an advantage in the next elec-
tion. 
If Democrats were really concerned 
about the security of our democracy 
and the integrity of our elections, if 
they 
really 
cared 
about 
affirming 
Americans’ faith in our electoral sys-
tem, they would not be seeking to 
break the Senate rules to pass a to-
tally—totally—partisan election 
bill 
on a totally partisan basis. A partisan 
Federal election takeover is not going 
to do anything to strengthen Ameri-
cans’ faith in our system. On the con-
trary, it will sow mistrust and division 
and heighten partisanship. 
Instead of changing the rules to gain 
an advantage in the next election, I 
would suggest that my Democrat col-
leagues instead try coming up with an 
agenda that would appeal to a broad 
majority of Americans—perhaps start-
ing with a plan to address the inflation 
crisis the Democrats have helped cre-
ate. That would be a far better use of 
their time than undermining faith in 
our electoral system with a partisan 
rules change and a partisan Federal 
takeover of elections. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will 
speak today on two topics—No. 1, the 
substance of the bill, which is, I guess, 
yet to be known, regarding voting 
rights, which I consider to be a Federal 
takeover of State elections, and the 
constant threat of changing the rules 
of the Senate to do away with the leg-
islative filibuster as we know it. 
I would say to my Democratic col-
leagues, this has been going on for 
quite a while, the constant threat by 
Senator SCHUMER to change the rules 
to pass whatever legislation you-all 
can come up with. 
All I can say is, things were different 
when we were in charge. We had the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House. President Trump constantly 
urged Senator MCCONNELL and all of us 
on the Republican side to change the 
rules of the Senate so he could pass his 
agenda unimpeded; that anything that 
came out of the House, which was 
under Republican control, could sail 
right through the Senate with Repub-
lican votes only. 
It was pretty clear to my Democratic 
colleagues that was not a good out-
come, I thought for the country, but I 
guess for them. 
We signed a letter on April 7, 2017—61 
signatures: 28 Republicans, 32 Demo-
crats, and 1 Independent. The letter 
was sent to Senator MCCONNELL, who 
was the majority leader, and the mi-
nority leader was Senator SCHUMER at 
the time, urging both leaders that, no 
matter what differences we have had 
regarding Executive nominations and 
judges, we should preserve the minori-
ty’s rights under the so-called legisla-
tive filibuster.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S126 
January 11, 2022 
Apparently, it made perfect sense to 
my Democratic colleagues that the 
Senate not change to accommodate 
Donald Trump and his wishes. I was as-
suming that the statement by my 
Democratic colleagues was about the 
institution, not just about the Trump 
Presidency and the times in which we 
lived in 2017. 
Apparently, I was wrong—except for 
a handful. And to Senators SINEMA and 
MANCHIN, you have led from the front, 
not from the rear. You have taken your 
fair share of criticism as you have op-
posed changing the Senate rules to ac-
commodate the voting rights bill, and 
it has been—the argument goes that 
this is so fundamental to democracy, 
voting, that the Senate has to give way 
in this instance. 
All I can say is that when many of us 
were in your shoes, we didn’t make an 
exception for a piece of legislation that 
we thought was critical to the future of 
the country. And it would be easy to 
find an exception here and there and 
everywhere, to the point that the rule 
bends with the exception. Now, I appre-
ciate your steadfastness in that regard, 
and, apparently, as you read the news, 
a few more Democrats are becoming 
publicly unnerved by the thought of 
changing the legislative filibuster— 
just a handful. And we are supposed to 
be in over the weekend, I think, maybe 
even 
into 
Monday, 
to 
have 
the 
change—rules change—but that may be 
in flux now because it appears a hand-
ful of Democrats are showing some dis-
taste for changing the rules. I don’t 
know why they are coming out now. I 
appreciate it. 
I don’t think it would be very pop-
ular in certain States to change the 
rules of the Senate that would pave the 
way for the most radical agenda in my 
lifetime. I don’t know if that has got 
something to do with it or if there is a 
newfound religion here by a handful. 
To the rest, I won’t forget this. I was 
1 of the 28 Republicans who signed the 
letter to the leaders of the Senate ask-
ing that the institution maintain the 
legislative filibuster, and not because 
it benefited me personally but because 
I thought it benefited the American 
people. 
The day you make the Senate the 
House, we are going to have wild policy 
changes. When we are in charge, we 
will go down one road; when Democrats 
are in charge, they will go down an-
other road, and there will be a just 
unnerving aspect of this, in my view, 
and I think for well over a century, the 
Senate 
has 
prevented 
these 
wild 
changes. And that means you don’t get 
what you would like as conservatives. 
The same people who are applauding 
my resistance to changing the fili-
buster today were all over me when we 
were in charge wanting me to change 
the filibuster. I understand that. 
Ideological people want their way, 
and they don’t particularly care how 
they get it. Most Americans have a 
more balanced approach about how the 
legislative process should work, and I 
think, over time, the requirement to 
get a handful of people from the other 
party to pass legislation, particularly 
major legislation, has served the coun-
try well. 
There are things that we would do 
completely different than our Demo-
cratic friends because we have different 
views, and some of these ideas just 
never make it through the Senate. And 
every now and then we will come up 
with solutions to hard problems that 
are bipartisan because we have to, as 
long as the legislative filibuster is 
around. 
So the idea of changing the legisla-
tive filibuster would pave the way, if 
Democrats have all branches of govern-
ment here, to make DC and Puerto 
Rico a State. I think they would. It 
paves the way for increasing the num-
ber of Justices on the Supreme Court 
because liberals don’t like the current 
makeup. I think there would be a move 
to abolish the electoral college, which 
would be devastating for South Caro-
lina. 
And to all the people in this body, 
adding two more States may serve 
your interests, but it certainly dilutes 
the power you have as an individual 
State. 
So the legislative filibuster is a stop 
sign to the most radical agenda I have 
seen since I have been up here, and it 
was a stop sign to the Trump agenda, 
and you just fill in the blanks. 
This effort by Senator SCHUMER to 
abolish the legislative filibuster under 
the guise of a single exception is cyn-
ical and I think a sign of desperation. 
I like Senator SCHUMER. I have been 
able to work with him—immigration 
and other hot-button issues—but the 
truth of the matter is, this all started 
back when President Bush’s judicial 
nominees were filibustered en mass 
that led to the Gang of 14, spearheaded 
by Senator Byrd, sort of one of the 
icons of the Senate, to make sure that 
filibustering judges would be done only 
in extraordinary circumstances. We 
broke the logjam. We lost a couple of 
good conservative judges as part of the 
compromise, and that held until it no 
longer held. 
In 2013, I got a call from Senator 
SCHUMER—I never will forget it—that 
we are going to push for a rules change 
when it comes to court of appeals and 
district court judges—I think in 2013. 
I remember the reaction I had and 
Senator McCain’s, and they were able 
to do that. And when President Trump 
became President and had a couple of 
Democratic—excuse me—a couple Su-
preme Court vacancies to fill, they 
were all filibustered, starting with 
Gorsuch, to the point that we changed 
the rules so that he could get some 
people on the Court who I think were 
highly qualified. So the bottom line is, 
when it comes to judges, the ship has 
sailed. Executive appointments, maybe 
that should have been changed. The ef-
fect on the judiciary, I think, is going 
to be detrimental over time. 
The most ideological elements of 
each conference will have a large say 
about what kind of judges we put on 
the court, and you will see a change 
over time from the right and the left 
because you no longer have to reach 
across the aisle to put a judge on the 
court. 
Apply that to legislation and, again, 
it would be devastating to the country 
and this body to not require some form 
of consensus when it comes to legisla-
tion and deny the minority the ability 
to require that consensus. 
As to voting rights itself, I think this 
is the most hyped, manufactured issue 
in a long time. This is a problem in 
search of—it is not a problem in search 
of a solution; it is a manufactured 
problem. 
States under our Constitution are 
supposed to run elections. In my State, 
I think we do a pretty good job. There 
are some efforts to change election 
laws throughout the country. As more 
and more people vote by mail, I think 
it is incumbent that you have the same 
voter identification requirements by 
voting by mail as you do in person. It 
would be so easy to manipulate that 
system. 
The bottom line here is this is an ef-
fort by the Democratic leader to basi-
cally say that Republicans, at our 
heart, are a bunch of racists when it 
comes to voting; that the reason they 
are having to do this is that States are 
changing laws to disenfranchise people 
of color and minorities. 
I find that, like, incredibly offen-
sive—I mean, just beyond offensive. In 
my State, which is 30 percent-plus Afri-
can American, we have robust oppor-
tunity to vote. All these laws that are 
being changed to implement voter in-
tegrity, I think, are necessary in the 
times in which we live. 
But the bill coming before the body, 
whatever it is, is a federalization of the 
election 
process. 
It 
is 
not 
about 
enfranchising the voters; it is about 
enfranchising the ability of the left to 
take over the electoral process to skew 
it to their favor, and I think almost all 
of us see it that way over here. 
So, you know, as a Republican, par-
ticularly from the South, you sort of 
get used to being called a racist. It is 
never pleasant, but you sort of get used 
to it. It is the cheapest form of politics. 
It is very unsavory to the people in my 
State. 
I went through that process in 2020, 
and I hope I have lived a life to con-
vince reasonable people that, whatever 
flaws I have, being a racist is not one 
of them. 
And to clothe this exercise here as 
some kind of moral imperative that if 
we don’t do this bill, then people 
throughout the country will lose their 
right to vote because Republicans, at 
the end of the day, don’t want people of 
color to vote is beyond offensive, and I 
hope it fails and that we can get back 
to some sense of regular order around 
here. 
But I will end with this: When the 
shoe was on the other foot, most of us 
didn’t do this. Your country needs you

right now to speak up. If you support 
changing the legislative filibuster one 
time for the voting rights bill, you sup-
port the end of it because there will be 
no end to the exceptions. 
And most of you over there have been 
hiding in the corner, letting other peo-
ple take the arrows. It is time for you 
to speak up. I actually hope we have a 
vote because I want to know where 
people are, whom I can count on and 
whom I can’t, to understand what is 
transactional and what is about the 
body. Time will tell. 
I yield the floor to Senator CORNYN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, consid-
ering the way our Democratic friends 
talk about the state of voting rights in 
America, it is easy to see why some 
people have expressed concerns because 
if you took them at face value, you 
might be very worried about the state 
of voting rights in our country, but 
there is more to the story than that, 
which I will hope to explain here in the 
next few minutes. 
For example, when it comes to the 
alarmism about voting rights, look no 
further than the Democratic majority 
whip, Senator DURBIN
from Illinois, 
who said there is an ‘‘insidious effort 
to suppress the rights of voters of 
color.’’ 
Senator SCHUMER, the majority lead-
er, Senator from New York, has said 
the right to vote is ‘‘under attack in 
ways we have not seen in generations.’’ 
President Biden himself has said 
there is a ‘‘21st century Jim Crow as-
sault’’ on the right to vote. 
If you were to take these at face 
value and accept them, obviously, you 
would be very concerned about the 
state of voting rights. 
But there is more to the story, as I 
said. If you just listen to these state-
ments, you would think that the 
States—the 50 States—had just im-
posed literacy tests on voting. You 
would think the disgusting and subjec-
tive determinations of ‘‘good moral 
character’’ that existed before the civil 
rights movement had somehow sprung 
back to life. You might even wonder if 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States has struck down the Voting 
Rights Act itself. 
(Mr. KELLY assumed the Chair.) 
Obviously, none of these things are 
true. There is simply no concerted ef-
fort to attempt to prevent voters of 
color or any eligible voters from cast-
ing their ballots. 
The Voting Rights Act—one of the 
most important pieces of legislation in 
our Nation’s history—is alive and well. 
I think the Voting Rights Act has done 
more to change our country for the 
better than any other piece of legisla-
tion that I can think of. 
So, to be frank, the facts simply 
don’t support our Democratic col-
leagues’ alarming rhetoric about the 
state of voting in America. This nar-
rative of widespread voter suppression 
is nothing more than a scare tactic to 
achieve a political outcome. 
Our colleagues across the aisle have 
introduced many different versions of 
their Federal takeover of State elec-
tions bill, but the justification seems 
to always change. First they said it 
was a matter of election security; then 
of voter confidence; and then and now, 
a way to remove obstacles that pre-
vented people from voting. Today, our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
claim that this legislation is necessary 
because the States have passed new 
laws that restrict voting access. So 
let’s just take a look at what some of 
those laws entail. 
One of those laws in my State of 
Texas, where the goal is pretty simple, 
which is to make voting easier and to 
make it harder to cheat—Texas already 
offers 2 weeks of early voting in person, 
and the new law didn’t make any 
changes in that. For 2 weeks, you can 
show up and vote in person before elec-
tion day—hardly a restriction on peo-
ple’s access to the ballot. 
This law did, in addition to making 
sure that people had 2 weeks to vote in 
person early, extend voting hours in 
more than 60 different Texas counties 
and clarify that voters who were in line 
at the time the polls closed would still 
be able to cast their ballot. It doesn’t 
sound like voter suppression to me. 
But the law also took some measures 
to reduce opportunities for fraud or 
mischief. Texas voting systems must 
now be tested before an election to en-
sure there are no technical difficulties. 
I am sure all of us are familiar with the 
occasional problem with voting ma-
chines, technical difficulties that need 
to be fixed to make sure it counts each 
legitimate vote. And we did make sure 
that voting rolls reflected only quali-
fied voters. In other words, voters who 
passed away were removed from the 
voting rolls. 
My State, like others, has clarified 
that the temporary, pandemic-related 
measures were not intended to be per-
manent. We did take some extraor-
dinary precautions in the midst of 
COVID–19 to make sure people had ac-
cess to the ballot. But these are hard-
ly—restoration of the status quo before 
COVID–19 is hardly an example of voter 
repression. 
I mentioned Texas and its expansive 
right to cast your ballot in person and 
to make sure everybody in line when 
the polls close could still cast their 
ballot. 
Another State that has come under 
fire is Georgia. As a matter of fact, the 
Attorney General of the United States 
has sued Texas and Florida and Geor-
gia under the Voting Rights Act. And, 
of course, President Biden is high-
lighting the Georgia laws because he is 
visiting today doing what I have never 
seen a President do before, and that is, 
villainize a State’s new voting law, 
which, to me, is a bizarre thing for a 
sitting President to do, to travel to a 
State for the purpose of villainizing 
that State’s law. 
I doubt he will mention the fact that 
Georgia actually extended early voting 
to 17 days. That is not an example of 
voter suppression, of trying to restrict 
people’s access to the ballot. As a mat-
ter of fact, that is much more generous 
than what President Biden’s home 
State of Delaware has offered in terms 
of early access to the ballot. 
So these clearly are not examples of 
Jim Crow voter suppression. These are 
commonsense measures designed to en-
courage people’s confidence in the in-
tegrity of the voting systems and to 
make sure that they are both acces-
sible and secure. These efforts should 
not be villainized; they should be ap-
plauded. They shouldn’t be twisted be-
yond recognition, trying to manipulate 
the facts in order to achieve a political 
outcome. 
If these State voting laws, then, are 
not designed to restrict access to the 
ballot, you might wonder whether 
there was a preexisting problem. So 
let’s have a look. 
Did voters actually have a problem 
casting their ballot during the last 
election? Well, following the 2020 elec-
tion, the Pew Research Center con-
ducted a poll of the voting experience, 
and it found that the vast majority of 
voters, 94 percent—94 percent—said 
that voting was easy. I don’t think you 
could get 94 percent of people to agree 
that the Earth is round anymore, but 
here we have 94 percent of the voters 
who voted with ease in 2020. This is a 
stark contrast with the claimed as-
sault on voting rights that we have 
heard so much about from our col-
leagues on the left. 
Despite what the radical left might 
lead you to believe, there is no nation-
wide assault on voting rights. If there 
were, every person in this building 
would be lined up to defend the right to 
vote, not just Democrats. This is a 
manufactured 
crisis 
designed 
to 
achieve a political outcome. 
There are plenty of safeguards al-
ready in place to prevent discrimina-
tory voting laws from taking effect, 
the most important of which, as I have 
already said, is the Voting Rights Act. 
Because of this legislation, the Justice 
Department has the authority to take 
action against any State, any political 
entity that discriminates on the basis 
of race, color, or membership in a lan-
guage-minority group. This has been 
the case for half a century, and no 
one—no 
one—wants 
to 
weaken 
or 
eliminate those protections. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues on the left have misrepresented 
the picture of voting rights in America 
to justify this partisan power grab. The 
legislation they have introduced does 
more to enhance their own power than 
it does to address voting rights. These 
bills aren’t about supporting disenfran-
chised voters or fighting voter suppres-
sion because, as we know, there is no 
nationwide assault on the right to 
vote, notwithstanding what some have 
claimed. This is simply about enhanc-
ing the political power of the Demo-
cratic Party. They want to seize 
States’ 
constitutional 
authority

January 11, 2022 
manage their own elections and use it 
for their own benefit. 
That is one of the most curious 
things about this debate that we are 
hearing from some of our Democratic 
colleagues. They want to actually vote 
for 
a 
nationwide, 
one-size-fits-all 
standard, to the detriment of their own 
States’ voting laws. 
It is pretty strange to come here rep-
resenting a State—let’s say I was in 
the shoes of the Democrats. If I were to 
come here to say ‘‘Well, my State has 
passed voting laws. I represent my 
State, but I want the Federal Govern-
ment to take over the voting laws and 
to suppress and supersede the voting 
laws in my State’’—that is what our 
Democratic colleagues are asking for. 
President Biden, apparently, rather 
than changing the voting laws in his 
home State of Delaware, wants the 
Federal Government to create a one- 
size-fits-all answer to voting rights in 
America—again, something that is in-
consistent with the Constitution and 
makes no sense at all. 
Well, to make matters even worse, 
some of our colleagues are even advo-
cating blowing up the Senate in order 
to achieve their goals because they 
know they don’t have 60 votes in order 
to close off debate. 
Now, the 60-vote requirement is the 
subject of a lot of controversy, but, 
frankly, it makes good common sense. 
In a country as big and diverse as 
America, do you really want to have a 
partisan majority of 51 writing the 
laws that affect 330 million people, 
only to have, after the next election, 
the next majority undo those or change 
them in some other way? Wouldn’t you 
want a mechanism that forces us to do 
what we might consider to be a little 
unnatural, which is actually to build 
consensus and build bipartisanship to 
make sure that the laws we pass are 
not 
only 
adequately 
debated 
and 
thought out, but they could endure be-
yond the next election because they en-
joyed the support of bipartisan majori-
ties? 
That is what the 60-vote cloture re-
quirement is really about. It is about 
making sure that purely partisan out-
comes don’t succeed and forcing us to 
do what I believe is in the best interest 
of the American people, which is force 
us to work together to achieve bipar-
tisan consensus. 
The election takeover bill may be the 
first one our Democratic colleagues try 
to pass if they eliminate or weaken the 
filibuster, but it won’t be the last. This 
isn’t going to be a one-and-done exer-
cise. Anybody who says you can carve 
out voting laws and everything else 
will remain the same is just kidding 
themselves and the American people. If 
the Democrats created a carve-out for 
election-related bills, there would be 
nothing—nothing—stopping them from 
resurrecting early versions of the elec-
tion takeover bill and passing them on 
a completely partisan basis. 
Previous versions of this bill would 
have turned the historically bipartisan 
Federal Election Commission into a 
partisan body. They would have man-
dated ballot harvesting and seized 
States’ 
constitutional 
authority 
to 
draw their own congressional districts. 
These are the types of radical measures 
that we could see under what our col-
leagues call a modest carve-out. 
If our Democrat colleagues elimi-
nated the bipartisan 60-vote require-
ment, the floodgates of partisan legis-
lation would surely open. Last year, 
our colleagues tried to pass legislation 
that exploits the cause of pay fairness 
to send a wave of business to trial law-
yers. They pushed for another bill that 
would impose crushing legal penalties 
on those who refuse to comply with 
woke social norms. 
If the filibuster—the 60-vote bipar-
tisan filibuster—were eliminated, Re-
publicans would have no way of stop-
ping these bills from becoming law. 
And it doesn’t stop there. The threat 
doesn’t stop there. 
Think of the most controversial bills 
that our Democratic colleagues have 
proposed. They could add new States to 
the 
Union—DC 
statehood, 
Puerto 
Rican statehood. They could pack the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
with liberal Justices. They could pass 
laws that infringe on the Second 
Amendment to the Constitution, the 
right to keep and bear arms, or legalize 
abortion up until the time a baby is de-
livered in the third trimester. They 
could impose job-killing taxes and 
kick-start the Green New Deal. 
So what is at stake here this week is 
far more than the fate of one or two 
bills. Our colleagues are proposing to 
put a thumb on the scale to benefit the 
Democratic Party. 
If the filibuster, the bipartisan 60- 
vote requirement, is eliminated, our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
will have unchecked power to write the 
laws affecting 330 million Americans. 
We know they are already willing to 
manufacture a voting rights crisis to 
increase their own power. If they are 
willing to do that, what aren’t they 
willing to do? I know I am not alone in 
saying I hope we never find out. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will 
my colleague from Texas yield for a re-
quest, just a request. I would like to 
borrow his chart. 
Mr. CORNYN. I have yielded the 
floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. OK. My colleague, I 
would yield to you. I have the floor. 
Do you mind if I borrow your chart? 
Great. Thank you. 
Now, my good colleague from Texas 
says 94 percent of voters said voting 
was easy in 2020. So why don’t we keep 
it that way? 
Isn’t it true that all of the changes 
that we are arguing about are post- 
2020, and is it an overwhelming likeli-
hood that this number, if these changes 
are allowed to go into effect, will go 
way down? So, yes, we agree. Keep the 
2020 laws. Maybe we should improve 
them. Right now, what we are com-
bating is a series of legislatures—19— 
and 33 laws that will make this number 
surely go down because it makes vot-
ing less hard. So we agree that 2020 
worked out OK. I guess my friend is 
saying the Big Lie is false because Don-
ald Trump said it was fraudulent, the 
election results. 
I would thank my colleague for his 
chart and will be using it again. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would 
the Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I sure would. 
Mr. CORNYN. Would you give me an 
example of one of the laws passed in 
Georgia or in Texas since the 2020 elec-
tion which you believe suppresses the 
right to vote. 
Mr. SCHUMER. There is a long list of 
them, which I have listed in my speech-
es. Let me just give one or two: one, 
making early voting places and dropoff 
voting places many fewer; No. 2, in the 
largest 
county—Democratic 
county, 
African-American county—in Georgia, 
taking away the bipartisan ability to 
collect those votes; No. 3, in Georgia, 
making it a crime that, if you are 
standing in line, you can’t be fed, and 
the lines, by the way, according to the 
reports I get, are much longer in Afri-
can-American communities than in 
White suburban communities, making 
it much, much harder—making it a 
crime, rather—to give people water or 
a sandwich. 
So I am going to now give my re-
marks, but I thank my colleague for 
the question, and I am going to take 
the floor. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
one more question to clarify your re-
sponse. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The last question, 
yes. 
Mr. CORNYN. Is the Senator sug-
gesting that ballot harvesting should 
be required in all 50 States? That is the 
ability of a partisan or a participant in 
a political election to go around to 
nursing homes or to other vulnerable 
populations and collect ballots and 
turn them in. 
Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator would 
yield, as long as there is no fraud, if a 
person in a nursing home can’t get to 
the polling place and wants to vote and 
someone collects their ballot, there is 
nothing wrong with that. In fact, that 
is good. That makes it easier for them 
to vote. 
With all of these things that they 
bring up, there has been no evidence of 
fraud—none. Donald Trump has not 
produced any evidence of fraud. He lost 
by 7 million votes. Yet he is saying he 
won the election. 
We all know what is motivating our 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle—obeisance to Donald Trump. I 
would guess most of them know that 
the election was not stolen, that the 
Big Lie doesn’t take effect, but Trump 
has such power over the Republican 
Party—such power—that they do what 
he wants in the legislatures and here in 
the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S129 
January 11, 2022 
I would remind my good friend from 
Texas that his fellow Texans George H. 
W. Bush and George W. Bush proudly 
supported an extension of the Voting 
Rights Act. They proudly did that. It 
was bipartisan until Donald Trump 
came over and, in my opinion, poisoned 
the Republican Party on voting rights. 
We could use a little resistance to Don-
ald Trump. We see it from a good num-
ber of Republicans out in the country, 
and we see it from a good number of 
Republican 
commentators, 
but 
we 
don’t see it here in the Senate, and 
that is unfortunate. 
I am not going to yield for a further 
question. 
Mr. President, as I begin my re-
marks, let me begin with the following 
figure—and we will have a debate later. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me 
begin with the following figure: 55 mil-
lion people; that is the estimated num-
ber of eligible voters who now live 
within States that have passed legisla-
tion restricting the right to vote and 
potentially undermining the electoral 
process. 
Today, President Biden will travel to 
one such State, Georgia—home to one 
of the most egregious voter suppression 
and election subversion laws we have 
seen in a long time. I believe the Presi-
dent will give a strong speech and will 
urge that we in the Senate change the 
rules so that we can prevent these 
awful and nasty laws from being imple-
mented. In an address to the Nation, he 
will use the bully pulpit of the Presi-
dency to make the case that the time 
has come for the Senate to pass voting 
rights legislation and take whatever 
steps necessary to address this Cham-
ber’s rules in order to accomplish that 
goal. 
The Senate is going to act as soon as 
tomorrow. It is my intention to, once 
again, bring legislation to the floor to 
fight back against the threats to de-
mocracy and protect people’s access to 
the ballot. 
Once again, I urge my Republican 
colleagues to take up the flag of the 
traditional Republican Party, not only 
of Lincoln but of Reagan and H. W. 
Bush and W. Bush and vote yes to move 
forward so we can have a debate like 
the debate we just had or the discus-
sion we just had. But if Republicans 
continue to hijack the rules of the Sen-
ate to prevent voting rights from hap-
pening, if they continue paralyzing this 
Chamber to the point where we are 
helpless to fight back against the Big 
Lie, we must consider the necessary 
steps we can take so the Senate can 
adapt and act. 
For the past few months, Senate 
Democrats have been holding talks 
within our caucus to discern how we 
can best move forward to restore the 
function of the Senate and, more im-
portantly, pass legislation to defend 
democracy and protect voting rights. 
Last night, I held another round of 
talks with a number of my colleagues 
about the path forward, and we did so 
again this morning. 
Over the past few days, our Repub-
lican colleagues have escalated their 
attacks against our efforts to pass vot-
ing rights legislation. 
Listen to this one: Last night, the 
Republican leader worked to place a 
number of ‘‘gotcha’’ bills onto the leg-
islative calendar as some sort of pay-
back for pursuing legislation to protect 
the sacred right to vote. He was basi-
cally saying: Here are 18 bills that 
Democrats don’t like. Let’s go for 50 
votes on those. Well, I proposed to the 
Republican leader, in a unanimous con-
sent request, that it would be perfectly 
fine with us taking votes on his bills on 
a simple majority threshold if, in ex-
change, he agreed to do the same for 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. Of course, the Republican leader 
immediately 
objected—immediately 
objected—to having all of them done 
with 50 votes: the 18 bills he proposed 
and our 2 voting rights bills. 
The Republican leader made clear 
last night that the true worry on the 
other side isn’t about the rules of the 
Senate—rules 
they 
were 
perfectly 
happy to change to pursue their own 
objectives when they were in the ma-
jority. Republicans, in truth, are afraid 
of the possibility that legislation to de-
fend democracy, to fight the power of 
dark money, and to protect voting 
rights could move forward in this 
Chamber. 
As I mentioned to my colleague from 
Texas, that is not all Republicans. 
That is not Republicans out in the 
country—a lot of them want to protect 
voting rights—but it is the Republican 
Party as now run by, and it is fair to 
say run by Donald Trump, who has 
propagated the Big Lie that the elec-
tion was stolen and that he really won, 
even though he lost by 7 million votes 
and even though he has no evidence— 
nor have the commentators to that ef-
fect. Now we have at least Republicans 
in the Senate and the House and in lots 
of State legislatures completely going 
along with this Big Lie. 
The danger there is that it jaundices 
our democracy. If people of color, if 
young people, if older people, if people 
in urban areas feel that their right to 
vote is being diminished compared to 
other people’s—because they are not 
aiming this at everybody—democracy 
begins to wither. We have not seen an 
assault on voting rights since the days 
of the Old South, since the forties and 
fifties and sixties and seventies. Why 
would we want to regress? Why would 
we want to regress? So we must fight 
back. 
Now, I understand our Republicans 
are going to continue their opposition 
through a flurry of speeches, decrying 
any effort by Democrats to undo these 
voter suppression laws and make it 
easier for Americans to vote. 
By the way, I would remind my col-
leagues that this has been the grand 
tradition of America. When the Con-
stitution was written, in most States, 
you had to be a White male Protestant 
property owner to vote. No one says 
let’s go back to those days. In general, 
America, with our march to freedom 
and our march to equality, embodied in 
our Constitution and in the great 
minds of the Founding Fathers—the 
greatest group of geniuses ever assem-
bled—has marched forward. There have 
been regressions, but we have marched 
forward. We Democrats want to con-
tinue that march. We want to stop 
these types of laws. 
The Republican leader doesn’t have 
much to say so he has latched onto a 
talking point. He said the Big Lie is ac-
tually the warnings of voter suppres-
sion that come from Democrats, even 
though there are so many laws that 
are, obviously, done to suppress votes, 
and a lot of these Republican legisla-
tors say it openly. 
So I would say to the Republican 
leader that his attempts to misdirect 
from the danger of Donald Trump’s Big 
Lie and to try to say it is Democrats 
who are doing it is gaslighting, pure 
and simple. There is no evidence—no 
evidence. 
The leader did it again yesterday and 
today on the floor, implying one more 
time that because the 2020 election 
was, indeed, successful, somehow voter 
suppression doesn’t exist. Now, I an-
swered my friend from Texas when he 
held up that chart. The Republican 
leader cherry-picked examples to dis-
tract from the real, unmistakable 
changes that are taking place in the 
States. 
I would ask the Republican leader 
and the Republican Senator from Texas 
and every other Republican, if the 2020 
election were as successful and secure 
and safe as he says it was, then why 
have 
Republican 
State 
legislators 
rushed to make it harder for people to 
vote in the aftermath of the 2020 elec-
tion? Why can any Republican cling to 
the view that the election was stolen— 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie—when JOHN 
CORNYN, my friend from Texas, is up 
there, with a chart, saying the 2020 
election was successful, and the Repub-
lican leader said the same thing? 
Doesn’t that rebut Donald Trump? 
Doesn’t that rebut those who came to 
the 
Capitol, 
motivated 
by 
Donald 
Trump’s propagation of the Big Lie? 
Doesn’t it rebut all of the State legisla-
tors who want to make it harder to 
vote if the 2020 election were success-
ful? 
Despite the Republican leader’s best 
efforts, I have yet to hear from my Re-
publican colleagues as to why it is OK 
for States like Georgia to make it a 
crime to give food and water to people 
who are waiting on line at the polls 
when we hear that, in minority areas 
and in urban areas, the lines are much 
longer than in rural areas. 
I have yet to hear from Republicans 
why States like Texas and Arizona 
have made it a felony—a felony—for 
nonpartisan election workers to send

unsolicited mail ballot applications to 
voters. What is wrong with sending 
that? What is wrong with encouraging 
people to vote? The participation in 
elections is much higher in many West-
ern countries than in ours. 
Again, Texas didn’t just prohibit 
nonpartisan 
election 
workers 
from 
sending mail ballots out to voters. 
They made it a felony—a felony. These 
States have effectively made it a 
crime—a crime—for election workers 
to proactively help people to vote. 
Where is the justification? 
Where is the evidence of this massive 
fraud that Donald Trump talks about? 
No one gives any. Yet they predicate 
their policy moves here in the Senate 
on that. 
To date, I have heard no explanation 
from the other side why States like 
Texas, Iowa, and Montana have re-
duced polling locations and hours. In 
Iowa, early voting of any kind has been 
cut by 9 days. How does that make the 
election more secure? Why is that in 
the grand tradition of making it easier 
for Americans to vote? 
In Georgia, according to the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution, 
the 
leading 
newspaper of Atlanta, the number of 
absentee drop boxes in four large coun-
ties in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area, 
will drop from 111 to 23—111 to 23. One 
of the justifications is that these boxes 
are no longer helpful, but this ignores 
the fact that over 300,000 voters used 
them in the last election—the last suc-
cessful election, according to my friend 
from Texas. Republicans know that 
most of the people who used those drop 
boxes, of course, were Democrats. They 
tend to use them more, and that is why 
they are cutting them off. 
The examples go on and on, unfortu-
nately. This is not just a one-off or in 
one State or another. This is a massive 
campaign, which, if we do nothing, will 
continue and get worse. 
States like Texas, Florida, Kansas, 
Iowa, New Hampshire, and Montana 
have passed laws making it harder— 
harder—to register to vote. 
States like Alabama, Iowa, and Texas 
have passed laws that increase the po-
tential for people with disabilities. 
And, again, in Georgia, one rural 
county, Lincoln County, is trying to 
limit their polling places to just one in 
the whole county—just one place to 
vote for an entire county—causing peo-
ple to potentially drive as many as 23 
miles to cast a ballot. This wouldn’t 
make voting easier. It turns it into a 
burden. 
The truth is, our Republicans can’t 
defend these laws. They are not going 
to mention them here today. Let’s hear 
some Republicans defend these laws 
and point to evidence of the massive 
fraud that they say motivates them to 
do it. It is bunk—bunk. 
The policies they have put forward 
have one purpose—one purpose only: 
making it harder for younger, poorer, 
non-White, and typically Democratic 
voters to access the ballot, to give Re-
publicans a partisan advantage at the 
polls by making it harder for demo-
cratic-leaning voters to vote. 
Again, in a democracy, when you lose 
an election, you figure out why and try 
to win over the voters you lost. You 
don’t stop the voters you lost from vot-
ing. That is what happens in autoc-
racies, in places like Hungary, where 
Donald Trump just endorsed Orban, 
who is whittling away at democracy in 
Hungary. 
It is cynical—cynical—for our Repub-
lican colleagues to argue that just be-
cause these voter suppression laws 
don’t spell their intentions out in the 
open, that there is nothing sinister at 
play. But these laws have real impact, 
potentially divisive. 
In 
Arizona, 
Mr. 
President, 
your 
State, the secretary of state has con-
cluded that new laws could purge as 
many as 200,000 voters from their early 
voting list. And as you know better 
than me, Arizona has a long tradition 
of early and mail-in voting that, I 
think, was set up by Republicans, if I 
am not wrong. 
In Georgia, over 1.3 million voters 
used absentee ballots in the last elec-
tion, which could now be affected by 
the restriction. 
Senate Democrats in Iowa argue that 
if today’s voter suppression laws had 
been in effect in 2020, over 6,500 absen-
tee ballots would not have been count-
ed in the last election. 
This isn’t all that difficult to com-
prehend. When you pass laws that raise 
barriers to voting, fewer people end up 
voting. That is a fact. So as the Presi-
dent will say later, we are approaching 
a decisive moment for the country. 
Voting rights, defending democracy 
have long been bipartisan issues in this 
Chamber. The Voting Rights Act of 
1964 is one of the crowning achieve-
ments not only of the civil rights era 
but of the history of this Chamber. It is 
in no way a power grab to say the Sen-
ate will pass laws that make it easier, 
simpler, and safer for American citi-
zens to exercise their most funda-
mental right. That has been part of the 
grand tradition of this country—usu-
ally, as I mentioned several times be-
fore, bipartisan. 
I will add: As we proceed, we cannot 
hang our hats on the false hopes of in-
adequate or sometimes chimerical so-
lutions. 
Substituting the Electoral Count Act 
for the much needed reforms that we 
have in the Freedom to Vote and John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act is insuffi-
cient, 
unacceptable. 
Obviously, 
it 
doesn’t affect the House and Senate. 
Obviously, it is not immediately ur-
gent because it affects 2024. But most 
importantly, scorekeeping matters lit-
tle if the game is rigged, and the game 
is in danger of being rigged if State Re-
publicans empower themselves to arbi-
trate the results of future elections in-
stead of it being arbitrated by what 
traditionally has happened in America 
by nonpartisan election workers. 
So we need to work in this Chamber 
to pass real solutions that go to the 
heart of the problem. We need to pro-
ceed with the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. We need to proceed with 
the Freedom to Vote Act. 
All of us in this Chamber must make 
a choice about how we will do our part 
to preserve our democratic Republic. 
We can’t be satisfied in thinking that 
democracy will win out in the end if we 
are not willing to put in the work to 
defend it. 
So we need to pass these bills so our 
democracy can long endure after this 
present danger. To continue blocking 
these efforts is to offer an implicit en-
dorsement of Donald Trump’s Big Lie, 
which, unfortunately, is alive and well 
in 2022. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the scheduled recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
last year ended with the best Christ-
mas present that this Congress could 
have given to the American people— 
the Democrats’ failing to pass Presi-
dent Biden’s reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. But, sadly, the Democrats’ fail-
ure doesn’t seem to have made them 
realize the reality they are operating 
in: a 50–50 Senate, where they have to 
actually work with both sides of the 
aisle to deliver bipartisan wins for the 
American people. 
They have now pivoted from a reck-
less tax-and-spend spree that would 
break the piggy banks of Americans to 
wanting to break the longstanding 
rules of the U.S. Senate. They have set 
their sights on changing the very core 
of this institution by eliminating the 
legislative filibuster. 
Some Americans may not even know 
what the filibuster is. The Senate fol-
lows many rules and procedures to pass 
legislation, and the filibuster is an im-
portant tool that gives the minority 
party the ability to voice concerns and 
help shape any bill the majority party 
may bring up. 
The filibuster serves as a check 
against the majority party wishing to 
act without input from the minority. 
Basically, with the filibuster, the ma-
jority has to work with the minority. 
That is the bottom line. 
Voting to end debate on a bill is com-
monly referred to as ‘‘ending a fili-
buster.’’ It simply means that the Sen-
ate agrees that there has been enough 
debate, including amendments, and it 
is now time to take a vote. And as one 
of the Senate rules, it requires 60 votes 
to end debate and move to passing the 
bill. 
Even if you aren’t familiar with com-
plicated Senate procedures, just know 
that the filibuster is important because 
it protects the deliberative nature of 
the Senate. 
It ensures we function as an institu-
tion rooted in compromise, common

ground, and a sense of unity. We rep-
resent all Americans, not just a few. 
Looking back on the history, you 
will see it has been utilized as a stand-
ard Senate practice by Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents alike. 
It is so important that in 2005, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, whom you just heard 
speak, said: ‘‘The ideologues in the 
Senate want to turn what the Found-
ing Fathers called ‘the cooling saucer 
of Democracy’ into the rubber stamp of 
dictatorship.’’ 
Yes, he said that doing away with the 
filibuster would effectively create a 
dictatorship. 
More recently, in 2017, Senator SCHU-
MER doubled down on the need to keep 
the filibuster in a letter to Leader 
MCCONNELL. In his letter, Senator 
SCHUMER argued for the protection of 
‘‘existing rules, practices and tradi-
tions as they pertain to the right of 
members to engage in extended debate 
on legislation before the United States 
Senate.’’ 
To sum that up, he said no way 
should we cancel the filibuster. 
That letter was signed by 33 Demo-
crats, many of whom are still serving 
in this Senate as we speak. One of the 
signers who served at that time who 
signed this document is now the Vice 
President of the United States. 
And it is not just the Vice President 
who has warned against ending the fili-
buster. In 2005, on this very floor, Sen-
ator Joe Biden warned that if the abil-
ity to filibuster were abolished, done 
away with, the Senate would become 
the House of Representatives. 
I recognize that both sides of the 
aisle have, at some point, diminished 
the filibuster on nomination votes. In 
2013, then-Senator Harry Reid lowered 
the vote threshold for Presidential ap-
pointments, other than Supreme Court 
nominees, to 51. In 2017, the Repub-
licans turned around and lowered the 
standard to 51 for Supreme Court nomi-
nees. 
Based on that, the left may call our 
opposition now hypocritical. But there 
is a big difference between legislation 
and nominations, including policy and 
our budget and nominees. 
Debating legislation should include 
input from all Senators and be subject 
to compromise through the amendment 
process in order to be made better. 
A nominee’s qualifications are not 
subject to input or change. Voting on a 
nominee is a take-it-or-leave-it vote. 
You can’t change their background or 
qualifications with more debate or 
more amendments. That is why they 
moved the vote to 50. 
But the filibuster on legislation 
forces the majority to take into ac-
count the minority’s position and to 
make the changes necessary to earn 
their support. 
So now that the Democrats seem to 
be changing their tune on the legisla-
tive filibuster, it might be worth ask-
ing what has caused the Democrats to 
flip-flop and why now? 
Well, there is one notable reason. Be-
tween 2017 and 2022, who is in control of 
the White House and Congress now? 
Back in 2017, when the Democrats 
were in the minority, they understood 
the value of the minority’s vote. But 
now they are in the majority, and all 
bets are off. They want to race through 
their party’s Big Government socialist 
agenda with as little or no debate or 
opposition as possible. And Senate 
Democrats have embraced a radical, 
win-at-all-cost game plan for passing 
their progressive agenda, and they in-
tend to and will break the Senate if 
they do it. 
Democrats say their war on the fili-
buster has to do with strengthening 
voting rights, and they want to make 
it easier to vote and harder to cheat. If 
that were true, Democrats wouldn’t 
have any problem passing this on a bi-
partisan level. 
We all want to safeguard our elec-
tions so that all Americans have con-
fidence in the integrity of our coun-
try’s election process. But if access to 
the ballot box were an issue, it might 
come as a surprise that the 2020 elec-
tion saw the largest voter turnout in 
over a century. 
The Democrats are simply operating 
under a false idea. The States should 
run our election system, not the Fed-
eral Government. 
What is more is, they will tell you 
they are embarking on this crusade to 
‘‘save our democracy.’’ But the prob-
lem is, they want to do it by blowing 
up our democracy, blowing up this 
room. 
Ending the filibuster means we would 
govern only by majority rule, stifling 
the voice of all minority and millions 
and millions of people who voted for 
the people who are in here in the mi-
nority. 
Instead of saving it, this one-party 
rule would be the end of our democracy 
as we know it. 
Instead of including the minority’s 
voice in legislation that should serve 
all Americans, we would have radical 
swings back and forth every time the 
majority changed hands in this room. 
Right now, there are few Democratic 
Senators who have stood up for the fili-
buster. They understand the important 
role of the minority’s voice. This is not 
the House of Representatives. They un-
derstand the importance of making 
sure we listen to the voices of the mil-
lions of Americans who voted for the 
minority party, whoever it is. They 
know what even a small ‘‘exemption,’’ 
or what they call a ‘‘carve-out,’’ could 
lead to—devastation to this room. 
So I ask the rest of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle: Why not 
join us and save the filibuster? That is 
what makes us the voice of all Ameri-
cans. Why not focus on what you can 
do to lead in the face of many crises ac-
tually facing the American people? 
In a recent poll, nearly 50 percent of 
Americans disapproved of President 
Biden’s handling of COVID. The dis-
approval ratings were even higher 
when it came to the economy, taxes, 
crime, government spending, and im-
migration. It is clear that, right now, 
Americans need more adults in this 
room and more leadership, and I can 
guarantee that the American people do 
not want leadership that resorts to 
changing the rules to get their way, to 
notch a win. The American people want 
leaders who actually address the prob-
lems they face, like COVID and infla-
tion. 
We cannot allow the failed leadership 
of Big Government socialists to be a 
scapegoat for eliminating the filibuster 
and fundamentally changing our coun-
try for the worse. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ALAN DAVIDSON 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
rise to speak in support of our next 
vote, the nominee to head the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration at the Department of 
Commerce, Alan Davidson. 
My colleagues know now, in an infor-
mation age, how important access to 
broadband is. They know because of 
COVID–19 how important it is for 
healthcare, how important it is for 
education, and how important it is for 
people to have the flexibility in all 
parts of the United States to have ac-
cess to the ability to connect and to 
connect with people around the world. 
We have long talked about the need 
for an NTIA Administrator who under-
stands the public sector and under-
stands the private sector. Mr. Davidson 
does that. He comes to us with a 
wealth of experience in both sectors, 
and he is coming at a time when my 
colleagues have been asking for more 
leadership from the administration on 
broadband issues. That is to say, many 
of my colleagues, like Senator WICKER, 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, and many others, 
have asked for coordination between 
various programs that exist within the 
Department of Commerce, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and the issues in 
coordination with the FCC and over-
sight of their programs to better maxi-
mize the delivery of broadband. 
The Presiding Officer knows how 
much money is now on the table for 
broadband. We all know that this im-
plementation is going to take a very 
skilled hand at trying to address both 
the issues of affordability and access. 
But more importantly, we will be get-
ting with Mr. Davidson somebody who 
understands these issues well and will 
help us strive to get America better 
connected as quickly as possible.

S132 
January 11, 2022 
We can’t say enough about how im-
portant that is as COVID–19 continues 
across the United States of America 
with different variants. I am not say-
ing it is going to be the new normal 
and continue for the next several 
years, but we know this: We need Mr. 
Davidson’s help. We need his help effec-
tively and speedily to get broadband 
deployed to both sectors of our econ-
omy—those who are unserved and 
those who are underserved. 
We look forward to advancing this 
nominee and putting him to work as 
quickly as possible, and I personally 
look forward to working with him on 
these very important issues. There is 
much to do to leverage the dollars we 
have made available, but we have to 
work cooperatively with all parts of 
the United States to make that a re-
ality. 
Nothing could be more important 
now to upgrading U.S. infrastructure 
than getting fiber deployed, getting 
broadband to American homes, and 
making our grid more secure. With all 
of these things, I look forward to work-
ing with Mr. Davidson, and I appreciate 
his comments to me about his commit-
ment to those issues as well. 
I yield the floor.

GUANTANAMO BAY 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 20 
years ago today, a C–141 Starlifter 
made its final descent toward a naval 
base in the Caribbean. As the plane 
landed, two white schoolbuses waited 
on the apron, together with a swarm of 
military humvees and a large contin-
gent of armed soldiers. 
The plane door opened, and the pas-
sengers were offloaded. Heads shaven, 
legs shackled, the passengers were re-
moved from the plane one by one, each 
wearing the same identical outfit: a 
fluorescent orange jumpsuit, a match-
ing ski cap, and earmuff-style noise 
protectors. Some were also wearing 
blackout goggles over their eyes to 
completely deprive them of any sen-
tient experience. 
This was the scene as the first 20 de-
tainees were hauled off to Guantanamo

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S133 
January 11, 2022 
Bay 4 months to the day after Sep-
tember 11 and the hideous terrorist at-
tacks. 
That afternoon, former Secretary of 
Defense Donald Rumsfeld assured the 
public and made a statement. Listen to 
his words carefully. This is what the 
Secretary said: 
We do plan to, for the most part, treat [the 
detainees] in a manner that is reasonably 
consistent with the Geneva Conventions. 
Madam President, that Orwellian 
double-talk kicked off a 20-year saga at 
Guantanamo Bay, a chapter in Amer-
ican history that it is time to close. 
As we now know, the detention facil-
ity at Guantanamo Bay was delib-
erately created to avoid the require-
ments of the Geneva Conventions and 
other time-honored treaties that Amer-
ica used to brag about being party to. 
In the words of one senior official in 
the Bush administration, Guantanamo 
exists ‘‘in the legal equivalent of outer 
space.’’ The facility was designed to be 
a legal black hole, where detainees 
could be held incommunicado, beyond 
the reach of laws, beyond public scru-
tiny, and subjected to torture and un-
speakable abuse. It is where due proc-
ess goes to die. 
Perhaps the most shameful lie sur-
rounding the creation of Guantanamo’s 
detention facility was that it would 
help deliver justice to the families of 
the thousands of Americans who died 
on 9/11. 
In March 2002, then-President George 
W. Bush delivered a speech before Con-
gress where he promised that the ter-
rorists who attacked America on 9/11 
would ‘‘not escape the justice of this 
nation.’’ Yet, two decades later, the 
families who lost loved ones that day 
are still awaiting justice. The case 
against the alleged 9/11 coconspirators 
has not been resolved. In fact, it has 
not even gone to trial 20 years later. At 
this very moment, those terror sus-
pects are sitting in cells in Guanta-
namo without any resolution in sight. 
Think about how the world has 
changed 
since 
September 
11, 
2001. 
Osama bin Laden has been hunted 
down. The war in Afghanistan, our Na-
tion’s longest war, is over. Four Presi-
dents—four different Presidents—have 
presided over the facility at Guanta-
namo 
Bay. 
But 
despite 
all 
these 
changes and all this history, one tragic 
truth remains: America has failed to 
provide closure to the families of the 
victims who suffered those unimagi-
nable losses on September 11, and that 
is simply because Guantanamo was 
never intended to deliver justice. 
If justice delayed is justice denied, 
Guantanamo speaks for itself, and the 
documented history of Guantanamo 
Bay cannot be disputed. 
Last month, the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which I chair, held a hearing on 
closing Guantanamo Bay finally, once 
and for all. One of the witnesses who 
was particularly touching was Colleen 
Kelly, whose brother Bill died in the 
North Tower on 9/11. During her testi-
mony, she said: 
Five men stand accused in the military 
commissions at Guantanamo of responsi-
bility for planning and supporting the 9/11 
attacks. Today . . . a trial has not even 
begun. Instead, family members have heard 
years of argument in pre-trial hearings. 
While these hearings have produced no legal 
justice for 9/11, they have revealed the shock-
ing role of torture in undermining [any] 9/11 
prosecution. 
At the end of her testimony, Ms. 
Kelly said: 
My brother Bill was killed in what was 
likely the most public event in human his-
tory. My family does not have any of my 
brother’s remains, nor do one-third of 9/11 
families. 
She said directly to us: 
I am asking this Committee and the Biden 
Administration to deliver the next best 
thing—a resolution to the 9/11 Military Com-
mission that provides answers to our ques-
tions, accountability for unlawful acts, jus-
tice too long denied, and a path to closing 
Guantanamo. 
When Ms. Kelly spoke before the 
committee, she wasn’t just speaking 
for her family; she was speaking for 
our Nation. 
For 20 years, Guantanamo Bay has 
defied our constitutional values and 
the rule of law. It has actually weak-
ened our national security. It costs us 
dearly—morally, monetarily. 
Listen to the subsidy which Amer-
ican taxpayers give to Guantanamo 
Bay. It is a subsidy that subverts jus-
tice. Today, most Americans couldn’t 
answer this question: How many de-
tainees are there in Guantanamo? 
Thirty-nine. Taxpayers spend $550 mil-
lion a year to keep that facility open. 
Do the math. That is almost $14 mil-
lion per year on each prisoner. 
Moreover, two-thirds of the remain-
ing prisoners have never been charged 
with any crime. That is right—never 
charged. Yet they are being detained 
indefinitely, in violation of our basic 
constitutional principles. 
Of the 27 uncharged men, more than 
half of them have already been ap-
proved for transfer. Think of that. 
Some have been approved for years. 
Another was approved just yesterday. 
These individuals are languishing in 
Guantanamo for no justifiable reason 
and contrary to any notion of liberty 
or justice. 
Every day Guantanamo remains open 
is a victory for our Nation’s enemies. It 
is a symbol of our failure to hold ter-
rorists accountable and our failure to 
honor the sacrifices of our servicemem-
bers. These failures should not be 
passed on to another generation. They 
should end with the Biden administra-
tion. 
Last fall, I introduced an amendment 
to the National Defense Authorization 
Act to close Guantanamo. It was ambi-
tious, I know, but it was a goal that I 
felt is most consistent with who we are 
as Americans and what we say about 
justice. I was disappointed that the 
Senate didn’t take up any amendments 
literally or this amendment particu-
larly. Instead, it voted once again to 
prohibit the use of Federal funds to 
transfer Guantanamo detainees to the 
United States and made it even harder 
to transfer detainees to foreign coun-
tries willing to accept them. That just 
delays 
the 
Guantanamo 
experience 
even longer. 
But let me be clear, even with these 
legislative restrictions in place, there 
is more the Biden administration can 
and must do to accelerate the closure 
of Guantanamo. 
First, the administration should re-
patriate or resettle the 14 detainees 
who have been cleared for transfer. 
There is no excuse, none, for any fur-
ther delay, which is why President 
Biden should appoint a special envoy at 
the State Department to negotiate 
transfer agreements with other na-
tions. 
Additionally, the Biden administra-
tion should appoint a senior official 
within the White House who will be ac-
countable for leading the process of 
closing Guantanamo. 
Finally, 
the 
Justice 
Department 
should bring its legal positions in 
alignment with President Biden’s stat-
ed goal of closing Guantanamo in his 
first term. The Department has yet to 
correct course on a number of trou-
bling legal positions, including failing 
to acknowledge that our Constitution’s 
due process clause applies to prisoners 
held in Guantanamo. 
It is time to stop hiding from our val-
ues. Our Federal courts have proven 
more than capable of handling even the 
most serious and complex terrorism 
cases. They have done so swiftly and 
efficiently. 
Since 9/11, hundreds of terrorism sus-
pects have been tried and convicted in 
our Federal court system. Many are 
now being held safely in Federal pris-
ons. Meanwhile, as I mentioned, the 
case against alleged conspirators in the 
9/11 attacks still has not come to trial. 
In the face of unimaginable horror, 
such as the attacks on the World Trade 
Center and the Pentagon, we must turn 
to our system of justice to hold our en-
emies accountable. Legal black holes 
like Guantanamo are anathema to 
American values and accountability. 
One of the military officials who tes-
tified in last month’s hearing was Mi-
chael Lehnert. He was the very first 
commandant at the facility at Guanta-
namo. Where does he stand today on 
that facility? He is calling publicly for 
its swift closure. 
During 
his 
testimony, 
General 
Lehnert said that ‘‘most of America 
has forgotten about Guantanamo. But 
hear me when I tell you that our en-
emies have not. Closing Guantanamo 
responsibly restores the reputation of 
America,’’ the general said, ‘‘ensures 
accountability for those who have com-
mitted crimes against us, and provides 
closure for the families of those they 
have harmed.’’ 
By allowing Guantanamo to remain 
open, we are giving our enemies the 
power to define who America is. It is 
time to reclaim that power and prove 
to the world that America is not a na-
tion defined by our darkest moments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S134 
January 11, 2022 
We are a nation defined by our values. 
Let us start living up to them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Mississippi. 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, a few 
years back, I was watching a television 
news show and I saw video that struck 
me as strange. It was a video taken by 
a security device outside of a resi-
dence. Basically, someone is knocking 
on the door—multiple doors at this 
particular apartment—and the person 
knocking on the door basically said 
this: I am a volunteer for the Demo-
cratic Party, and I am here to collect 
ballots from those who wish to vote 
Democrat in the next election. 
I found that strange until I learned 
that that practice called ballot har-
vesting is perfectly legal in the State 
of California; in other words, it is all 
right for me as a volunteer for my 
party to go and knock on the door and 
say: I am here to collect your absentee 
ballot but only if you are voting for the 
candidate I am for. 
That is perfectly legal. That is called 
ballot harvesting. I hope my colleagues 
can see the opportunity for abuse in 
this particular practice. 
I think most State legislatures that 
have prohibited this sort of practice 
see the opportunity for abuse. What is 
to stop me from saying, ‘‘Knock. 
Knock. Knock. I am a volunteer for 
party X, and I am here to collect bal-
lots for people who like to vote for can-
didates of party X,’’ getting those bal-
lots and then perhaps forgetting to 
turn them in or perhaps losing them or 
not turning them in at all? 
That sort of practice is rife for abuse, 
and I think it is the reason that most 
States prohibit that. 
Soon we will be taking up a bill, 
which I am told, if it comes to us in the 
form that it is in now, would allow that 
sort of ballot harvesting. To me, if 
California wants to try this, that is 
their right. I think it is rife for abuse, 
and I wish they wouldn’t do it. But to 
impose these sorts of requirements on 
the rest of the Nation—our friends on 
the other side of the aisle propose this 
week to vote on destroying a provision 
that has served this Senate and this 
Republic well for over two centuries, 
and that is what is known as the fili-
buster but what I call the consensus- 
building, 60-vote rule. 
This is a time-honored way that this 
body has been unique, and it has en-
abled us to craft some of the most 
long-lasting and widely accepted legis-
lation in the history of this Republic. 
The Civil Rights Act of 1994 was passed 
with consensus because this Senate had 
to have 60 votes or more. In that case, 
it may have been a 66-vote rule. The 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed 
with 
that 
consensus-building 
tech-
nique. 
Medicare, 
Social 
Security— 
time-honored 
legislation 
that 
has 
served this Republic and its citizens 
has been passed with this consensus- 
building tool. 
And the leadership of my friends 
across the aisle would bring a measure 
to the floor later this week to repeal 
that and make us just like the House of 
Representatives, make us just like 
every Parliament in socialist countries 
around the world: majority rule, 51 
votes—you get it—destroying that one 
tool that makes us come together and 
reach compromise. 
And it wasn’t just bills passed dec-
ades ago. In recent years, during your 
term and mine, Mr. President, we 
passed major—major—veterans legisla-
tion with Johnny Isakson on one side 
and BERNIE SANDERS on the other side 
coming together to build more facili-
ties for veterans, to provide more 
choice for veterans. 
Senator MURRAY of Washington and 
former Senator Alexander of Tennessee 
came together with a major rewrite of 
an education bill. And we did it with 
the filibuster in place. We had to come 
to an agreement. We had to get over 60 
votes, and the bills were better because 
of that. 
For that reason, in April of 2017, 
when a Republican President—a Presi-
dent I voted for—said we ought to 
think about abolishing the filibuster, 
28 Republicans signed a letter saying, 
‘‘Let’s don’t do that.’’ They were joined 
by 32 Democrats and by 1 Independent 
who caucuses with the Democrats. If I 
might take the time to read the two 
short paragraphs: 
To Majority Leader MCCONNELL and 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER: 
We are writing to urge you to support our 
efforts to preserve existing rules, practices, 
and traditions as they pertain to the right of 
Members to engage in extended debate on 
legislation before the United States Senate. 
Senators have expressed a variety of opin-
ions about the appropriateness of limiting 
debate when we are considering judicial and 
executive branch nominations. Regardless of 
our past disagreements on that issue, we are 
united— 
Said these 28 Republicans and 32 
Democrats and 1 Independent— 
[we are united] in our determination to pre-
serve the ability of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate when bills are on the Senate 
floor. 
And now I am told, unless I have 
been sadly misinformed, that every 
Senator from across the aisle, save 
two—save two—are prepared to go 
against what was specifically said in 
this letter and, on election laws, say 
that we are going to make all the deci-
sions in Washington, DC, and take that 
away from the States. 
I heard the distinguished majority 
leader say earlier today—and I had to 
ask about it. I heard the distinguished 
majority leader say Georgia has, of all 
things, made it a felony to give water 
to people standing in line to vote. I sat 
listening to the majority leader in as-
tonishment. How could that possibly 
be? It turns out that if a charitable 
group or if a neutral person wants to 
come and give somebody water in line 
in Georgia, that is all right. What is 
against the law in Georgia is for me as 
candidate X to come up with a bottle of 
water that says ‘‘Vote for Candidate 
X’’ and give it to somebody in line. Ap-
parently, the people in Georgia in a de-
cision-making role had decided, once 
you get in line to vote, you are no 
longer fair game. Politicians should 
leave you alone once you get in line to 
vote. 
It is not a matter of giving somebody 
water; it is a matter of electioneering: 
Hi. I am ROGER WICKER, running for 
Senator. Here is a bottle of water. I 
hope you will remember me in another 
50 feet when you get into the polling 
place. 
The people of Georgia, in their wis-
dom, have decided that is going too far. 
And I am told—and perhaps the dis-
tinguished majority leader could come 
to the floor and correct me and I would 
stand corrected if he did—I am told 
that it is against the law in New York 
to do the same thing. Once you are in 
line in New York, somebody comes and 
hands you something that advocates 
for one candidate or another, that is 
forbidden not only under Georgia law 
but under New York law—and I can see 
the wisdom in that. 
Two months ago, there were two 
amendments to the New York Con-
stitution that were presented before 
the voters—the November 2 election, 
2021, in the State of New York. One 
would have deleted the current require-
ments that a citizen be registered to 
vote for 10 days. In my State, you have 
to be registered for 30 days. In New 
York State, it is 10 days. The law is 
you have to be registered for 10 days or 
you can’t vote. A proposition was put 
on the ballot to eliminate that, allow 
same-day registration. Guess what the 
voters of New York did on that pro-
posal a short 2 months ago. They voted 
56.3 percent no against that. 
Are we to assume that the voters of 
the State of New York are Jim Crow on 
steroids, as the President of the United 
States would suggest or can we pos-
sibly assume they thought a 10-day pe-
riod before voting was appropriate and 
that we should keep it that way? I 
choose to think that we want 30 days in 
Mississippi. If Maine wants same-day 
registration and if the voters of New 
York say 10 days is all right by a dou-
ble-digit margin, they have the right to 
do that. 
And, 
again, 
if 
the 
distinguished 
Democratic leader can prove me wrong, 
I would accept that and apologize to 
him for that. 
There was another issue on the bal-
lot, and I hope not to take too much 
more time because I see my distin-
guished colleague from Louisiana here. 
The amendment would have deleted the 
requirement that an absentee voter 
give an excuse, and these are the ex-
cuses you have in New York right now. 
You have to be able to—unable to ap-
pear because of absence from the coun-
ty or because of illness or physical dis-
ability. That is a requirement in New 
York. Somebody put on the ballot: De-
lete that requirement. Guess what the 
voters of New York decided. They de-
cided to keep that requirement by a

vote of, again, double digits—55.03 per-
cent of New Yorkers voted no on that. 
I don’t condemn them for doing that. 
I am sure they had a reason for doing 
that. But I think the leadership of the 
State of New York and the voters of 
the State of New York had a right to 
do that and I don’t condemn them for 
doing it and I would not—I would cer-
tainly not break a two-century, con-
sensus-building 
provision 
that 
has 
withstood the test of time to tell New 
York they can’t do that, to tell all the 
50 States that they must conform to an 
election law that we devise here in 
Washington, DC. 
This is a pivotal week. This is a week 
that will decide the future not only of 
the Senate but of the future of our gov-
ernment—our representative govern-
ment—and the future of our Republic. 
I urge my colleagues to think twice 
about this. Sometimes, I have had to 
stand up to my party and say: I can’t 
vote with you on that one. I know you 
want me to. I know I will suffer some 
reproach for not going with the team, 
but I am begging Members of both par-
ties to search their hearts and decide 
in this case we are going to preserve 
the 
one 
consensus-building, 
com-
promise-encouraging 
provision 
that 
has withstood the test of time. I hope 
that happens. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, and, hey, 
folks, did you hear about the attempt 
to steal an election? Maybe you heard 
this about a year ago or so, big at-
tempt to steal an election, just last 
year. We had Washington insiders 
colluding to overturn the will of the 
people in a fair and free election. 
Yes, you heard it right, an attempt 
to steal an election, but it is probably 
not the election that you are thinking 
about. Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives NANCY PELOSI attempted 
to steal a seat in the House. Iowa’s 
Second District Congresswoman won 
her election in 2020 and was certified by 
Iowa’s secretary of state, 24 county 
auditors of both parties, and the bipar-
tisan State Board of canvassers. 
And she is here with me today, Rep-
resentative 
MARIANNETTE
MILLER- 
MEEKS. I thank the Representative for 
being here today. 
In a blatant political power grab, the 
Speaker of the House spent over 
$600,000 of taxpayer money in an at-
tempt to unseat the duly-elected Con-
gresswoman MILLER-MEEKS. Even some 
reasonable Members of the Democratic 
Party sounded the alarm bell on this 
brazen attempt to reverse the election 
results. Representative DEAN PHILLIPS 
said at the time: ‘‘Losing a House elec-
tion by six’’—yes, by six—‘‘votes is 
painful for Democrats, but overturning 
it in the House would be even more 
painful for America.’’ 
Voters in Iowa and across America 
should choose their representatives 
without interference from politicians 
in Washington. Guaranteeing both the 
right to vote as well as the integrity of 
our election system ensures fair and 
free elections which are the foundation 
of our Republic. 
The attempt to overturn the Iowa 
election results was the opening salvo 
in the left’s ongoing rush to take over 
elections. Democrats’ proposals are 
seeking to limit voter ID, legalize bal-
lot harvesting, provide taxpayer money 
to campaigns, and weaponize the Fed-
eral Election Commission. Using fake 
hysteria, they are trying to blow up 
the Senate and fundamentally change 
our country. However, their very effort 
is unpopular, unnecessary, and unac-
ceptable. 
I served as a local county auditor and 
commissioner of elections. My home 
State has seen various commonsense 
election reforms throughout the years. 
In fact, in 2017, the Iowa Legislature 
modernized our laws, which also in-
cluded requiring voter ID. 
At the time of its passage, Democrats 
warned the law was dangerous and an 
unnecessary hurdle and a significant 
barrier for anyone who was not a White 
male. They could not have been further 
from the truth. Three times since the 
new Iowa voter law was implemented, 
the State has seen record high turnout 
for elections, record high turnout— 
huge voter participation. 
This includes record high absentee 
voting during the 2020 Presidential 
election. The 2021 elections also boast-
ed record off-year turnout. My friends 
on the other side of the aisle will have 
you believe that voters are being sup-
pressed in red States all over this coun-
try. 
The irony here is that New York, 
home of the Democratic leader, and 
Delaware, home of President Biden, 
have some of the most restrictive vot-
ing laws in the entire country. And 
Iowa, because it has modernized our 
elections in the course of the number 
of past years, has been demonized by 
Democrats when, oddly enough, Iowa’s 
election laws are much more progres-
sive than Delaware and New York. 
Just this past November, New York-
ers overwhelmingly voted down a bal-
lot initiative to allow no-excuse absen-
tee voting. New York voters also re-
jected a proposition that would have 
allowed individuals to register to vote 
and cast a ballot on election day. 
By the way, Iowa has same-day voter 
registration, thank you. 
Now, the senior Senator from New 
York is threatening to destroy the Sen-
ate to override the wishes of the resi-
dents of his very own State who voted 
against the policies he is trying to im-
pose on every other State. Does that 
sound like democracy to you? It is not. 
While the media will have you be-
lieve that Senate Republicans are 
blocking the Democratic leader’s agen-
da, it is really the voters of his own 
State. Liberal States have some of the 
most restrictive election laws in the 
country—and don’t take my word for 
it. 
An expose recently published in The 
Atlantic found some States that the 
Democrats control in the northeast 
make casting a ballot more difficult 
than anywhere else and that the voting 
bill being pushed in Congress would hit 
some blue States just as hard, if not 
harder—now, that is The Atlantic— 
than the red States they claim are lim-
iting the right to vote. And I will re-
mind you Iowa is much more progres-
sive than these States. 
Plain and simple, Washington Demo-
crats are gaslighting the American 
people. There is not a voting crisis in 
this country. It is manufactured. Their 
push to blow up the Senate and take 
over elections isn’t about voter access, 
it is about power, the same power that 
liberal elites in Washington abused in 
their rush to steal Iowa’s Second Con-
gressional District—now held by Con-
gresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS—and 
si-
lence Iowans’ voices. 
What was attempted in Iowa should 
never be allowed to happen anywhere 
ever again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my 
friend Senator SCHUMER, and some of 
my Democratic friends would like to 
change one of the enduring institutions 
of this institution. They want to get 
rid of the filibuster—and I call it the 
60-vote threshold. 
And a reasonable person might ask: 
Well, why not? Institutions change all 
the time. Change is the law of life. I 
will tell you why not. I want you to 
hear these words of wisdom: 
We are on the precipice of a crisis, a con-
stitutional crisis— 
Getting rid of the filibuster. 
the checks and balances which have been at 
the core of this Republic are about to be 
evaporated by the nuclear option— 
Getting rid of the filibuster. 
the checks and balances which say if you get 
51 percent of the vote you do not get your 
way 100 percent of the time— 
If you get 51 percent of the vote, you 
do not get your way 100 percent of the 
time in the U.S. Senate— 
that is what we call abuse of power. There is, 
unfortunately, a whiff of extremism in the 
air. 
Those are words of wisdom by Sen-
ator CHUCK SCHUMER, May 18, 2005. 
If we change the 60-vote threshold, if 
we change this institution which is 
part of the institution of the U.S. Sen-
ate, it will gut this body like a fish— 
like a fish. And everybody in this body 
knows that if that is accomplished, our 
institution will look like a scene out of 
‘‘Mad Max.’’ 
America is a—God, what a wonderful 
place. It is a big, wide, open, diverse, 
sometimes dysfunctional, oftentimes 
imperfect, but good country with good 
people in it. And I want to emphasize 
the diversity part. What constitutes 
the good life in my State may not con-
stitute the good life in Connecticut or 
in California or in Florida or in Maine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S136 
January 11, 2022 
And that is one of the reasons that 
we have and have had the institution of 
the 60-vote threshold. If you are going 
to make a law that is going to impact 
the entirety of this big, wide, open, di-
verse country, then you ought to have 
60 votes because if you only have 51 
votes, 51 percent of the vote does not 
get your way 100 percent of the time. 
It has worked for a long time. 
Now, I don’t want to sound like I am 
lecturing, because I get it. I get it. I 
get that my Democratic friends and 
some of my Republican friends, who, 
frankly, are probably thinking about 
this—but I get that my Democratic 
friends want to—that they want to 
serve their President. We all want to 
serve our President. But you especially 
want to serve your President when the 
President is of your own party. 
I remember when President Trump— 
now like President Biden—said: Change 
the filibuster. Get rid of it. I can’t get 
my bills passed. 
We said no. And by ‘‘we,’’ I mean Re-
publicans and Democrats. Here is the 
letter right here. It was led by Senator 
COLLINS, a Republican, and Senator 
CHRIS COONS. I signed it. We said no. 
Now President Biden wants to do the 
same thing. That is what Presidents 
do. They try to pass their bills. So I get 
it. 
To my Democratic colleagues and 
any Republican colleagues who are 
thinking about voting for Senator 
SCHUMER’s change of heart, I want to 
tell them: I get it too. I get it. I know 
the frustration. I have felt it. I have 
talked about it on this floor before. 
You know, we all come up here for 
one reason: to make this country bet-
ter. And we are ready to go to work, 
and we want to debate, and we want to 
decide. We didn’t come up here for 
delay. We didn’t come up here for stul-
tification. So I get it. I get the frustra-
tion. But you don’t satisfy those aims 
by not following these words of wisdom 
by Senator SCHUMER. 
Now, once passions have cooled, I 
don’t want my words to be construed as 
an assertion that everything about our 
body is perfect. There are changes, 
once passions have cooled and the fili-
buster is intact, the 60-vote threshold 
is intact—I use ‘‘60-vote threshold’’ be-
cause ‘‘filibuster’’ to some has negative 
connotations, and it is a positive rule, 
not a negative rule. But once passions 
have cooled, there are a lot of ques-
tions that we need to sit down and talk 
about, and if my Democratic friends 
want to talk about them, I will be 
there. Call the meeting. I will pounce 
on it like a ninja. 
I mean, there are questions that we 
need to be asking ourselves about this 
body; how we can make it better. Do 
we give our majority leader too much 
authority? It is not personal. Do we 
give our minority leader too much au-
thority? It is not personal, but that is 
a fair question. 
Every Member of this body knows 
about the diminution of our committee 
system. Why do we even have commit-
tees anymore, for God’s sake? I mean, 
you go work your committee, and you 
get a bill out, and it is a bipartisan 
bill, and you are feeling all toasty and 
ready to go, and you learn pretty quick 
around this place that doesn’t matter. 
It is probably dead as fried chicken if 
the majority leader doesn’t want to 
bring it up. And that is true whether 
the majority leader is Republican or 
Democrat. We need to have an honest 
conversation about the diminution of 
the committee process. 
Our amendment rules. My God, there 
is not a single Member of this body 
who really understands those rules. I 
mean, if you ask—pick 10 Senators at 
random and say: Tell me the truth, 
now. Do you understand the rules of 
the Senate about how to offer an 
amendment? Nine out of ten will tell 
you no, and the tenth is lying. We 
ought to have an amendment process 
that looks like somebody designed it 
on purpose, and we don’t. We ought to 
talk about that. 
We ought to talk about the fact that 
this body—it didn’t happen just yester-
day—has ceded an enormous amount of 
our power, under a Madisonian system 
of separation of powers, to the execu-
tive branch and to the administrative 
staff. 
After this is over, if any of my Demo-
cratic friends want to have that talk 
and see if we can’t come up with a way 
to improve this body and ask some 
hard questions, I will be there happily, 
and I hope we can make progress. But 
to my colleagues, I say: Please, please, 
don’t do this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Biden wants to pass a new New 
Deal. In fact, in some ways, the reck-
less spending the President is pushing 
for actually dwarfs the New Deal. But 
Joe Biden is not FDR, and we are not 
living in the Great Depression. The 
New Deal passed the House and the 
Senate on the back of huge Democratic 
supermajorities. 
Today, Americans have elected a 50– 
50 Senate and a razor-thin Democratic 
majority in the House. The American 
people voted for bipartisanship and 
compromise in the U.S. Congress, not a 
blanket mandate for progressives to re-
organize American life as they see fit. 
But some Democrats in Congress seem 
to think they did. 
Because they haven’t reached out to 
Republicans to work together on im-
portant issues, they haven’t been able 
to pass their Build Back Better plan, so 
they have turned their attention to an-
other kind of Federal Government 
overreach: overhauling the way our 
country runs elections. Their argument 
is that lawmakers in red States are 
trying to make it harder for people to 
vote, and so it is necessary for Wash-
ington Democrats to take over election 
administration in all 50 States. 
One important point: The first part 
of that is simply not true. The right to 
vote is not under assault. According to 
Pew Research, 94 percent of Americans 
believe that voting is easy. In my home 
State of Nebraska, we achieved a 
record 76 percent voter turnout in the 
2020 election, in the middle of a pan-
demic, because of all the different ways 
that my State made it easier for Ne-
braskans to vote, including expanded 
early voting and no-excuse absentee 
voting. But Democrats still want to 
pass a Federal takeover of elections. 
Because the rules don’t allow them 
to pass every single law they would 
like to in a 50–50 Senate, many of my 
Democrat colleagues are flip-flopping 
to oppose the filibuster. President 
Biden, who defended the filibuster dur-
ing his nearly 40 years in the Senate, 
now wants a special carve-out for 
Democrats’ election takeover. But who 
says it is going to stop there? The ma-
jority leader said in 2005, when Demo-
crats were in the minority, that doing 
away with the filibuster would ‘‘wash 
away 200 years of history’’ and mean 
‘‘doomsday for democracy.’’ Today, no 
one is pushing harder to end it than he 
is. 
And 
Democrats 
were 
perfectly 
happy to use the filibuster hundreds of 
times during the 4 years of the Trump 
Presidency, when the majority leader 
was the minority leader and Repub-
licans had even larger majorities in 
Congress. 
This isn’t some debate about some 
arcane Senate rule. This is about pro-
tecting the rights of the minority in 
our democracy. This is about providing 
stability and certainty to our people. If 
the majority is able to constantly push 
through their views and policy every 
few years, drastic swings in policy will 
take place. Tax policy, social policy, 
health policy, foreign policy, defense 
policy—the laws of the United States 
will start just to whip back and forth, 
following where the power lies in this 
Chamber, and those shifts will weaken 
our Nation both here at home and 
abroad. 
In 2017, the senior Senator from 
Maine and the junior Senator from 
Delaware led a bipartisan letter urging 
Senate leadership to preserve the 60- 
vote threshold for legislation. 
While I appreciate their efforts, I did 
not sign that letter. I was concerned 
that many Democrats only signed it 
because they were afraid the GOP— 
that Republicans were going to end the 
filibuster. I believed that many of my 
Democratic colleagues would soon turn 
against the letter’s own arguments and 
they would go back on their word. I be-
lieved that because a few years earlier, 
I had listened to reasons they gave for 
changing the executive filibuster for 
Presidential nominations when they

were in the majority, and I had then 
watched them reverse those positions 
when they were back in the minority. I 
felt they would flip again for political 
reasons as soon as they returned to the 
majority. 
Of the 61 Senators who did sign that 
letter, 30 were Democrats, 28 are still 
in office, and I am sorry to say that 
they have proved me right. But when 
Republicans were in the majority, we 
said we wouldn’t abolish the legislative 
filibuster, and we have kept our word. 
The truth is that some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues want to remake the 
American system only in their own 
image, not considering the views of 
about half of our citizens. To do that, 
they have to take an ax to the fili-
buster. But I urge them to think about 
the consequences their actions may 
have. 
Without the filibuster, any Senate 
majority would be free to ignore the 
other side to pass their own agenda. Bi-
partisanship? Well, it would become a 
relic of the past. I know that Demo-
crats don’t want that to happen. I don’t 
want it to happen, either, and that is 
why I have consistently supported the 
Senate filibuster no matter who is in 
power. 
I urge my colleagues to think beyond 
the passions of the moment and to do 
what is best for this country in the 
long term: Leave the filibuster in 
place. Democrats may want to use it 
again as soon as next year. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, in a let-
ter written in 1789, Thomas Jefferson 
declared that the ‘‘earth belongs to the 
living, not the dead.’’ Relationships be-
tween generations, he explained, are 
but that of a distant set of independent 
nations. 
Mr. President, I don’t know how 
many of my Democratic colleagues 
still admire Mr. Jefferson, but they are 
certainly taking his words to heart. 
There is little concern on one side of 
this Chamber about the impact of our 
actions beyond our own time here. 
There is a belief that the importance of 
this hour’s partisan ambitions out-
weighs the value of centuries-old insti-
tutions. 
Abandoning the 60-vote threshold in 
order to seize control of America’s 
elections isn’t simply shortsighted, it 
is clueless. It is the exact opposite of 
what the people who sent us here want. 
Back home in Indiana, I hear from 
anxious Hoosiers because these are 
anxious times. I know what is on their 
minds—rising inflation, the cost of put-
ting food on their table and gas in their 
tanks. I hear from them about paying 
to heat their homes. Many are strug-
gling to pay next month’s rent. 
They are tired of and still worried 
about a pandemic that President Biden 
promised to shut down, and they are 
angry. Many are angry about a south-
ern border that this President has left 
wide open. 
In the middle of all this—an afford-
ability crisis, an ongoing pandemic, a 
broken border—changing the Senate 
rules to nationalize Indiana’s elections, 
to repeal popular voter ID laws, to use 
tax dollars to fund political campaigns 
are not high among Hoosier priorities 
or the priorities of the American peo-
ple. 
Do you know what is, though? Con-
gress coming together, finding com-
promise, actually addressing, in a col-
lective way, our shared national chal-
lenges. It is one of the most widely ig-
nored messages of the last election. 
Every one of my colleagues should take 
note. If America wanted a radical, ex-
treme, partisan set of changes put for-
ward, they wouldn’t have evenly di-
vided the U.S. Senate. Believe it or 
not, they want us to collaborate, and 
we have shown them we are capable of 
doing that. 
Let me remind my colleagues, we 
formed a united front against China 
when it comes to competitiveness and 
trade policy. We helped American 
workers and small businesses hurt by 
the pandemic. We gave our troops a 
pay raise. Now, these and so many 
other achievements are really impor-
tant. They are achievements that will 
benefit Americans now and in the years 
to come. We need to do more working 
together. 
Now, look, I have been around here 
long enough. I understand that my 
Democratic colleagues are frustrated. I 
say to my colleagues, you have had less 
success with your reckless multitril-
lion-dollar social spending bill than 
you would like. I understand that. 
Your proposal to federalize and politi-
cize American elections has been a 
tough sell. I understand that. 
As a result, America’s democracy, we 
are told, is in peril, and the only way 
to save it is to kill the 60-vote thresh-
old. But the 60-vote threshold is not 
the source of our Nation’s dysfunction. 
I say to my colleagues, your Demo-
cratic radical agenda is driving much 
of the angst, the anxiety, and the frus-
tration among the American people. 
The so-called legislative filibuster is 
not a threat to our democracy; ending 
it is. 
My advice is to rethink your prior-
ities. If you want to end gridlock, do 
the difficult work of actually building 
coalitions of support: introduce bills to 
be referred to the committees of juris-
diction that Republicans can actually 
vote for, allow for an open amendment 
process as we did with the China bill. 
Now, this is the entire point of the 
60-vote threshold. It is a forcing mech-
anism, during fraught times like these, 
that gives the minority a say in the 
process. It forces majorities to find 
ways to compromise. It incentivizes bi-
partisan collaboration among Senators 
representing diverse parts of our Na-
tion with differing values, differing pri-
orities. Americans want us to go 
through this hard work of finding com-
mon ground, of reconciling our dif-
ferences. That is our job. And, yes, it is 
an obstacle to simple majority rule. It 
is an obstacle to one party—either 
party—razing our institutions by the 
slimmest of margins. But need I re-
mind my colleagues, this is not a direct 
democracy, this is a republican—small 
‘‘r’’—form of government. 
Frustrating as it may be, the fili-
buster, in its way, is a source of and 
sometimes the source of order and even 
unity in Congress. 
Now, if you think our current polit-
ical division is troubling, colleagues, 
torch the filibuster, foist your unpopu-
lar partisan priorities on all Ameri-
cans, and then check the health of our 
democracy. Pour gasoline on this rag-
ing fire. Don’t be shocked by its sorry 
state after you do so. 
I will close with a familiar caveat. 
Majorities, no matter their size, never 
endure. Looked at in the light of 
human history, all of us, even the most 
long-tenured, are here for a little more 
than a hiccup in time. Yes, what one 
party sows today, the other will of 
course reap tomorrow. Clearing the 
path 
for 
every 
grandly 
ambitious 
Democratic priority aimed at reshap-
ing our country would only clear the 
way for a future Republican effort to 
repeal and replace it with one of our 
own, with even greater scale. 
Beyond this, though, as much as I ad-
mire Thomas Jefferson, I do not be-
lieve that the Earth belongs only to 
the living. No. Citizens place both their 
trust and their destiny in a set of 
shared institutions. In America, this 
forms a compact that stretches across 
centuries and generations. It includes 
those in the grave and those yet un-
born. And for the moment, we—Repub-
licans, Democrats, Independents—we 
are its custodians. 
If we give in to temporary passions, 
if we tear our institutions to shreds 
rather than work through them to 
serve the people, rewriting the rules 
when we don’t win the game, we are 
failing in our jobs. We are breaking 
that compact. 
So, as I said in my first speech on 
this floor, standing right over there— 
and I will repeat it until my last 
speech—we are, above all else, the 
custodians of the common good—the 
common good. Remember that, col-
leagues, before you take a hammer to 
one of the Senate’s signature means of 
advancing it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I have 
had the privilege of serving Arkansans 
in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of 
Representatives in both the majority 
and minority. So I know how unmis-
takably important it is to protect the 
rights of the minority in the interest of 
individual States—especially those like 
Arkansas that are more rural and less 
populated. 
That is what our country’s Founders 
had in mind when they designed the

S138 
January 11, 2022 
Senate. The Senate is sometimes re-
ferred to as ‘‘the world’s greatest delib-
erative body’’—the key word being ‘‘de-
liberative.’’ 
It is not crafted to quickly approve 
or reject legislation passed by the 
House as a mere formality. Instead, it 
offers equal representation to each 
State and a procedural process that 
incentivizes and rewards consensus. 
Allowing individual Senators to se-
cure and, just as importantly, stop dra-
matic policy changes is what sets this 
body apart. The filibuster provides 
each of us leverage that must be pre-
served. 
Unfortunately, many of our col-
leagues on the other side have suc-
cumbed to shortsighted political cal-
culations and are endorsing changing 
the Senate’s rules in order to jam 
through their legislative priorities. 
However, the ability to prevent rad-
ical, swift, and far-reaching changes 
that would surely sow confusion and 
uncertainty is invaluable. As such, I 
intend to continue protecting the fili-
buster. 
Our Democratic friends, with some 
exceptions, are now abandoning their 
previous support for the filibuster, 
which, while in the minority, they ar-
gued was indispensable and utilized 
with zeal to great effect. 
Even President Biden, who enjoyed a 
long career in the Senate and exercised 
his right to stop or hamper legislation 
and nominees he had concerns with, 
has decided his decades-long embrace 
of the filibuster is no match for the 
loudest voices in his party demanding 
to discard it. 
The justifications all point in one di-
rection: keeping power. 
Today, the Biden administration and 
Senate Democrats believe a supposed 
threat to our democracy requires aban-
doning the minority party’s ability to 
pump the brakes on the excesses of 
one-party control in Washington. 
Worse, the grave threat to the fabric 
of our society and experiment in self- 
government they are touting amounts 
to nothing more than duly elected 
State legislatures reining in some of 
the most overly accommodating voting 
policies that were enacted during the 
COVID–19 pandemic: things like rea-
sonable limits on absentee voting, 
commonsense registration rules, and 
practical deadlines. 
Instead, they want to bring the full 
weight of the Federal Government 
down on States like Arkansas that 
have sought to protect election integ-
rity by instituting voter ID, blocking 
ballot harvesting, or ensuring the accu-
racy of voter rolls. 
These commonsense safeguards are 
not an existential threat to our Nation, 
nor do they warrant breaking the Sen-
ate and being unconstitutionally super-
seded. 
It is concerning that most Members 
of the majority are now singing quite a 
different tune when it comes to tin-
kering with longstanding rules of the 
Senate to achieve partisan ends. 
I think it is important to applaud our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who remain committed to protecting 
the filibuster and, by extension, the 
very integrity of this institution. They 
have come under intense pressure. Yet 
I recognize and they recognize how im-
portant this tool is, the harm that 
would come from abandoning or under-
mining it, and that majorities in the 
Senate do not last forever. 
Should the Senate go down this path, 
it would result in exceedingly scorched 
Earth, where consensus is even harder 
to find and shifting majorities imple-
ment drastic policy transformations 
when 
a 
President 
is 
willing 
to 
rubberstamp whatever Congress ap-
proves. 
I have opposed this ill-advised tactic 
in the face of opposition from my own 
side of the aisle in the past and under-
stand it is not always an easy thing to 
do. 
My colleagues and I will not acqui-
esce on this question, and I hope the 
Senate can move on, in a bipartisan 
way, to addressing the challenges that 
our country is facing and finding solu-
tions that actually help Americans fac-
ing real-world problems instead of 
spending any more time on partisan 
threats that upend this body’s tradi-
tions that would ultimately diminish 
its unique and necessary place within a 
government that is truly the envy of 
the world. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to join my dis-
tinguished colleague from Arkansas. I 
agree with everything that he has said 
about this latest power grab by the 
Democrats in the U.S. Senate—of their 
effort to change the rules, to rig the 
rules, of course, through an agenda 
which I see, as do so many Americans, 
as radical and extreme and dangerous 
and scary. What the Democrats are 
proposing right here is to muzzle the 
voices of half of the country. 
So why are they doing this? Well, it 
really has nothing to do with the prior-
ities that are the priorities of the folks 
from my home State of Wyoming or 
from the previous speaker’s home 
State of Arkansas or from the next 
speaker’s home State of West Virginia. 
Oh, no, it has nothing to do with that. 
It has nothing to do with the priorities 
that the Gallup poll tells us are the 
concerns 
all 
around 
America: 
the 
coronavirus and the crisis we face 
there; the crisis at the southern border, 
where we are looking at almost 2 mil-
lion illegal immigrants coming into 
the United States; crime in the cities, 
with murders up year after year and 
just amazingly up this year. 
Then, of course, there are the raging 
fires of inflation, which are cutting 
into people’s paychecks so that money 
doesn’t go as far. When families in 
home States are looking at the fact 
that they are going to be paying about 
$3,500 more next year than the last and 
the year before that just to keep up, to 
maintain the quality of living, they 
have a lot of concerns. What the Demo-
crats are trying to do isn’t even one of 
them because the Democrats are trying 
to take a Federal takeover of elections. 
That is what they are trying to pass. 
They want to cram through a bill that 
they know otherwise would not pass. 
So what is in the bill? Well, the 
Democrats want to do things like ban 
voter identification. You know, in my 
home State of Wyoming and I know in 
the previous speaker’s State of Arkan-
sas and the soon-to-be speaker’s State 
of West Virginia, we know that people 
believe, if you want to get a ballot and 
if you want to vote, you should have to 
prove you are who you say you are. 
In the home State of the Presiding 
Officer and the former Presiding Offi-
cer and in many States, if you want to 
go to a restaurant, you have to show 
your papers to prove you were vac-
cinated or to go into a building or to go 
to a sporting event. Yet the Democrats 
are proposing that you shouldn’t have 
to show anything to prove you even are 
who you say you are in order to vote. 
What about the incumbents who 
want to vote for this thing? Oh, did we 
mention there are taxpayer dollars 
going to incumbent Members of Con-
gress to pay for their political cam-
paigns? No wonder so many of the 
Democrats have voted for this. It is 
money into their own pockets. 
The Democrats want Washington, 
DC, to micromanage elections across 
the country. They want to rig the rules 
of the Senate so they can enact this 
unpopular bill to take over elections in 
America. 
The American people aren’t asking 
for this. This recent Gallup poll that I 
alluded to asked people what they 
thought was the most important issue 
facing the country. Voting laws didn’t 
even crack the top 20. In a list of 23, it 
came in as 23rd. It is the Democrats’ 
No. 1 priority, and it is the last pri-
ority of the American public. It wasn’t 
even an asterisk. It didn’t even get 1 
percent of the vote. 
If the Democrats take over the Sen-
ate to take over elections and break 
the rules of the Senate, there will be no 
stopping them from passing the rest of 
this dangerous and extreme agenda. 
Democrats know that there is an 
election coming in November. They 
can read the polls. They know it is not 
looking good for them. They know 
there is a very unpopular President in 
the White House. They know that their 
numbers are sinking, that their ship is 
sinking, and that they will soon be in 
the minority in both the House and the 
Senate. 
Frankly, the election for the Demo-
crats in the election after that doesn’t 
look so good either because it only 
took 1 year for the people all across the 
country to recognize that the current 
President of the United States, Joe 
Biden, is both overwhelmed and inef-
fective as the President of the United 
States. There is no denying that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S139 
January 11, 2022 
Changing the rules, as the Democrats 
are proposing to do, really is their last 
chance to pass their leftwing, fringe 
ideas. It is the last chance to pack the 
Supreme Court. The Democrats in this 
body introduced legislation to pack the 
Supreme Court, to add four Democrats 
to the Court. It is the last chance to 
add new States to the Union. It is the 
last chance to give amnesty to millions 
of illegal immigrants. It is the last 
chance before Democrats lose control 
of the Congress. 
So why do they want to change the 
rules? It is because their agenda is so 
unpopular with the American people. 
They understand, as one Democrat said 
to another, that we have got to do it 
now because it is our last chance to 
force socialism on the American people 
whether they want it or not. 
Instead of changing the rules, the 
Democrats should change their agenda. 
The Democrats should focus on what 
the American people say is important 
to them. It is our constituents who de-
termine what is important to them. 
They are to communicate it to us. We 
are to represent them. 
What is important to them? Well, it 
is getting ahead of the coronavirus, it 
is securing the border, and it is really 
to stop adding fuel to the fire of infla-
tion when paychecks can’t keep up 
with the costs of gas and groceries. 
A Wall Street Journal story yester-
day was about all of the Democrats 
who signed a letter saying: money from 
New England, Members of this body— 
they said energy costs are so high, the 
government should do something about 
it. This is after Joe Biden kills the 
Keystone XL Pipeline and stops oil and 
gas exploration, and their own home 
States are blocking pipelines which 
could carry inexpensive energy to the 
people who live there. Yet the Demo-
crats want the government to do more. 
The government has done enough dam-
age already. 
There are lots of ideas that could 
pass the Senate and the House and be 
signed into law that would actually 
help the American people. Those are 
the things the American people are 
asking for. The American people are 
not asking for a blatant Democrat 
power grab to force through a very lib-
eral agenda. People don’t want to be 
muzzled. They don’t want to have their 
voices silenced. They want real solu-
tions. They don’t want the Democrats’ 
radical agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Connecticut. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
vote on confirmation of the Bose nomi-
nation at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader in consultation 
with the Republican leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to deliver I think one of my 
more important speeches that I will 
give as a Member of this body, and that 
is to defend the longstanding rules of 
the U.S. Senate. 
We are at a critical moment, make 
no mistake. With the slimmest of ma-
jorities, the Democrats haven’t been 
able to pass their wildly unpopular 
agenda, so they are considering using 
the nuclear option—just think of the 
term ‘‘nuclear option’’ to show you 
how draconian it is—to eliminate the 
Senate’s 60-vote threshold for legisla-
tion. They are doing it under the guise 
of protecting voting rights, but make 
no mistake—this power grab is not 
about voting rights. Instead, it is about 
advancing one party’s agenda. 
So I would like to take a look back 
at what Democrats, including Presi-
dent Biden, have said on the issue and 
why they are changing their tune. We 
can also debunk the argument that, if 
given the chance, Republicans would 
change the rules and eliminate the fili-
buster as the Democrats wish to do 
now. 
Finally and most important to me, I 
am going to talk about how this short-
sighted move would impact West Vir-
ginians, those whom I represent here in 
the Senate. They are the ones who will 
ultimately be hurt by this reckless and 
irresponsible change, and it is my re-
sponsibility to do what I can to stop it. 
So President Biden is in Atlanta 
today, taking the bully pulpit to pro-
test a State’s law that he does not like 
as a reason to end the filibuster. He 
even says this is one of those defining 
moments. It really is. People are going 
to be judged as to where they were be-
fore and where they are after the vote. 
It is interesting that he would say 
that because I would like to remind 
President Biden where he was when he 
was Senator Biden and what he had to 
say about eliminating the filibuster on 
this very floor in 2005. 
He said: 
It is not only a bad idea; it upsets the con-
stitutional design, and it disservices the 
country. 
Well, Senator Biden, I couldn’t agree 
more. But he is not the only one who 
has done a complete 180 when it comes 
to the filibuster. 
Majority Leader SCHUMER once said 
it would be ‘‘doomsday for democ-
racy’’—that 
sounds 
pretty 
bad, 
‘‘doomsday for democracy’’—if the fili-
buster were to be eliminated, and he 
was right. More recently, he has called 
the filibuster the most important dis-
tinction between the House and the 
Senate. Again, I couldn’t agree more. 
Then, from my home State of West 
Virginia, the late Senator Robert Byrd, 
a longtime Democrat, was unequivocal 
in his defense of preserving Senate 
rules. 
He wrote in 2010: 
The Senate has been the last fortress of 
minority rights and freedom of speech in this 
Republic for more than two centuries. I pray 
that Senators will pause and reflect before 
ignoring that history and that tradition in 
favor of the political priority of the moment. 
What would he say today? 
Again, this is not about voting 
rights. It is important to note that we 
did have a record turnout in 2020. More 
people voted than ever before. More 
than 158 million ballots were cast in 
2020, which is a 7-percent increase from 
2016, and we didn’t have this voting 
rights legislation. In West Virginia, we 
had thousands more people vote than 
voted in 2016. As a matter of fact, the 
total number of ballots that were cast 
in 2020 was more than in any election 
in our history with one exception—the 
1960 election of President John F. Ken-
nedy. 
So don’t believe the hyperbole. Don’t 
believe the rhetoric. Don’t take the 
bait. The party-wide flip-flop we are 
now seeing has nothing to do with vot-
ing rights. Instead, it has everything to 
do with paving the way for an aggres-
sive and progressive agenda that the 
Democrats wish to enact. 
One of the arguments from the other 
side that I hear all the time is, well, 
the Republicans would do the same 
thing and change the rules if given the 
chance. Guess what. We could have 
done that. Unfortunately, that argu-
ment doesn’t carry much weight. Lead-
er MCCONNELL, while sometimes under 
intense pressure to do this, never 
wavered, and we protected this institu-
tion. We didn’t change the rules on the 
legislative filibuster when we didn’t 
get our way. We could have, but we 
didn’t. 
Again, he knows, just as President 
Biden and Leader SCHUMER know, that 
if you can’t get what you want, chang-
ing the rules is no way to govern. I cer-
tainly wouldn’t run my household like 
that. It is no way to govern because it 
ultimately hurts those who sent us 
here to represent them. 
In my home State of West Virginia, 
do you know what they want? They 
want us to work together like they saw 
us do on the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. I hear this all the time. Biparti-
sanship is critical to making good and 
better policy, and if the Senate rules 
are changed, it would be a relic of the 
past. We just passed and signed into 
law the infrastructure bill that I 
worked to negotiate. We also passed 
the CARES Act. We passed opioid. We 
passed the Great American Outdoors 
Act—bipartisan. 
We can do this, but if we change the 
rules to where only 50 votes are needed 
to pass legislation, there will be zero 
incentive or motivation for the two 
sides to work together. Just as bad, 
legislative accomplishments could be 
done or undone or redone and done over 
and over with just one flip of a Senate 
seat. Policies harmful to my State 
could be enacted: the Green New Deal, 
court packing, the federalizing of our 
elections. By the way, 54 of my 55 coun-
ty clerks oppose that legislation. There 
would be packing the Senate with new 
States, defunding the police, attacking

the Second Amendment for law-abiding 
Americans, and more. 
We don’t even have to imagine what 
the Democrats would do or would want 
to do; we can just look at New York 
and what they just did. They are going 
to allow 800,000 noncitizens to vote. To 
put that in context, in my State of 
West Virginia, we only had 794,000 vot-
ers who voted for President in 2020. 
Ramming radical policies through 
Congress without even attempting to 
gain consensus is not what our Found-
ers envisioned, and it is not how Amer-
icans want us to operate. 
Rest assured, those willing to change 
the rules to benefit themselves will do 
it again and again and again. Today, 
supposedly, it is voting rights. Tomor-
row, it could be gun control. The next 
day, it could be open borders. I can 
only imagine. 
I am asking my fellow Senators on 
the other side of the aisle: Don’t do 
this. You will come to regret it, I 
think, if you do. 
But I think that we need to preserve 
the rights of the minority. 
We need to preserve the chance for 
bipartisanship. We need to preserve the 
traditions of the Senate. If you destroy 
this tradition, unfortunately, the coun-
try will suffer the consequences. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
may be one of the Senate’s newest 
Members, but that does not mean I 
don’t understand the importance of the 
filibuster to this body or to this Nation 
as a whole. 
Like Senators before me, I have ob-
served the practice from the other side 
of the Capitol as a Member of the 
House and have heard the calls from a 
frustrated majority to eliminate it for 
the sake of jamming through an agen-
da and cashing in the political gain 
that would come from doing so. 
But anyone who has an appreciation 
for our founding knows the purpose of 
the filibuster is indeed to frustrate the 
majority, to serve as an additional 
check in our government, and drive 
consensus and cooperation. Its purpose 
is to protect the rights of the minority 
and prevent the tyranny of the major-
ity—in short, to save us from our-
selves. 
The Senators supporting the major-
ity leader’s effort to eliminate the 60- 
vote threshold seemed to once under-
stand this too. Just a few years ago, 25 
of them cosigned a letter opposing 
‘‘any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to 
engage in full, robust, and extended de-
bate.’’ 
Sadly, we are now witnessing the 
most 
blatant 
hypocritical 
policy 
switch we have ever seen, as many cur-
rent Democrat Senators and the Presi-
dent have abandoned these principles. 
This flip-flop appears to be all in the 
name of greed and power. They want to 
break the filibuster so they can break 
other institutions, such as the Su-
preme Court and State-run elections, 
to rig our political system in their 
favor because they can’t win on their 
own radical socialist policies. 
Without the filibuster, we will see 
tax laws, immigration rules, and more 
major policy go up and down like a 
roller coaster, negatively impacting 
our economy, creating uncertainty, 
and making it impossible for long-term 
business planning. 
The filibuster is meant to force both 
parties to work together to come up 
with long-lasting policies which will 
help all Americans. 
Take, for example, voting legislation. 
I want to make it easier to vote and 
harder to cheat—easier to vote, harder 
to cheat. With NANCY PELOSI’s power 
grab act and other radical election pro-
posals, the Democrats want to let the 
Federal Government take over our 
elections, which is unconstitutional, 
make it easier to commit fraud, pave 
the way for mass ballot harvesting, let 
felons vote, take integrity out of the 
elections process by prohibiting voter 
ID—something I am proud to say Kan-
sas requires, voter identification, and 
it is working—and, finally, route tax-
payer dollars toward funding political 
candidates they may not agree with. 
I hope that Members of this body can 
come together, in a bipartisan way, to 
tackle the important issue of election 
integrity without destroying the 60- 
vote threshold in the Senate. 
We have shown, in recent weeks, we 
can work together in a bipartisan fash-
ion. The Senate voted 88 to 11 to pass 
the annual Defense authorization bill 
in December. The HELP Committee is 
currently working through a bipartisan 
bill to help tackle future pandemics. 
We can still tackle major issues in the 
Senate without abandoning our prin-
ciples. 
The right to extended debate for 
Members of this body has been pre-
served for two centuries, longer than 
the constitutional method of electing 
Senators via their home State legisla-
ture, which was ended when the 17th 
Amendment was ratified. 
It is a dark day that Senators are 
being forced to come to the Senate 
floor to defend the 60-vote threshold. It 
would be one of the body’s darkest days 
if 51 Senators changed the rules and re-
moved our rights to robust debate and 
the right of our home States to have 
equal representation in this most dis-
tinguished legislative body. And it will 
come back to haunt them. 
The answer to these partisan times is 
not to double down on partisanship and 
blow up the filibuster. I pray cooler 
and wiser heads will prevail, and we 
will maintain this important function 
of the Senate. Otherwise, our Nation is 
destined to become a winner-takes-all 
system, where the rights of the minor-
ity will never again be considered, and 
our Nation will suffer for it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my opposition to the 
majority leader’s plan to change the 
Senate rules. It will open the door wide 
for the filibuster to be eliminated for 
all legislation moving forward. 
The bottom line is very simple: The 
ideologues in the Senate want to turn 
what the Founding Fathers called the 
‘‘cooling saucer of democracy’’ into the 
rubberstamp 
of 
dictatorship. 
They 
want to because they can’t get their 
way. They want to wash away 200 years 
of history. They want to turn this 
country into a banana republic, where 
if you can’t get your way, you change 
the rules. It would be a doomsday for 
democracy. 
These are strong words, and these are 
wise words, but they are not my words. 
They are direct quotes from Senator 
SCHUMER back in 2005, when he was a 
staunch opponent of weakening the fil-
ibuster. That is because during that 
time, the then-junior Senator from 
New York and his Democratic col-
leagues were making unprecedented 
use of the filibuster to derail President 
George W. Bush’s judicial nominees. 
The majority leader at one point pro-
foundly admitted that ‘‘[y]es, we are 
blocking judges by filibuster. That is 
part of the hallowed process around 
here of the Founding Fathers saying 
the Senate is the cooling saucer.’’ 
But things have certainly changed 
two decades later. 
President Biden, the majority leader, 
and their Democratic allies were intent 
on ending the filibuster the second the 
Democrats won the Senate last Janu-
ary. 
The majority leader’s latest attempt 
is to force a carve-out of the filibuster 
for what he claims will be just for one 
piece of legislation. But he knows 
where it leads: the full elimination of 
the filibuster and sooner rather than 
later. 
I thought my friend the senior Sen-
ator from West Virginia put it per-
fectly last week. He said: 
The problem with carve-outs is that you 
end up eating the whole bird. 
There is no such thing as a carve-out 
when it comes to the filibuster. We all 
know it. I will talk a little bit about 
that later. 
But for more than a century, the fili-
buster has served as a safeguard for our 
Republic. It has prevented one party 
from ramming through an ideological 
agenda when that party controls both 
the White House and Congress. 
Without the filibuster, both the far 
left and the far right would have free 
rein to ram through extreme ideolog-
ical agendas. Divisive partisan pro-
posals could become law with only a 
simple majority. And with both parties 
regularly trading control of Congress, 
laws can just as easily be overturned 
and replaced, promoting the kind of 
chaotic, confusing policymaking we see 
in some European Parliaments. 
By requiring 60 votes to end debate in 
the Senate, the filibuster promotes sta-
bility. It necessitates bipartisan com-
promise to pass legislation. That is 
something we need more of, not less.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S141 
January 11, 2022 
I saw it firsthand when I was a proud 
participant in the passage of the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. That is the 
way this Chamber needs to work. 
That is why when President Trump 
demanded, I think some 30 times, that 
the Republicans should eliminate the 
filibuster in 2017, 61 Senators joined to-
gether in a letter making it clear that 
we would not let it happen. Thirty-two 
were Democrats, and 29 were Repub-
licans. I was one of them. 
And even though I received my fair 
share of pushback from my side of the 
aisle back in North Carolina, I was 
proud to sign that letter in 2017, and I 
would be proud to sign that letter 
today. 
Unfortunately, this modest display of 
political courage has not been recip-
rocated by many of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle. Twenty-seven of 
the Senators who signed that letter are 
still in the Senate. Twenty-six of them 
are now supporting the full elimination 
of the filibuster. What changed? Noth-
ing except the party in power. 
Democrats staunchly defended and 
used the filibuster when Donald Trump 
was President at an unprecedented 
level, but Democrats are suddenly 
against the filibuster now that Joe 
Biden is President. Many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues are practicing situa-
tional principles: putting their own 
party’s short-term interests ahead of 
what they know are the best long-term 
interests for the Senate and the Na-
tion. It doesn’t get more politically 
cynical than that. 
President Biden served in the Senate 
for 36 years. He was known as a strong 
defender of the institution, including 
the filibuster. In this very Chamber, 21 
years ago, Senator Biden declared that 
defending the filibuster was about de-
fending ‘‘compromise and moderation.’’ 
And he noted that his speech was one 
of the most important he would ever 
give. But now he favors destroying 
compromise, moderation, and the insti-
tution he had long cherished, all for 
the sake of political expediency for the 
next 12 months, until Republicans take 
back the House and most likely the 
Senate. 
As I noted earlier, the majority lead-
er also shares a partisan double stand-
ard with the President. In a ‘‘Dear Col-
league’’ letter just earlier this month, 
he wrote that ‘‘Senate Democrats must 
urge the public in a variety of different 
ways to impress upon their Senators 
the importance of acting and reforming 
the Senate rules, if that becomes a pre-
requisite for action to save our democ-
racy.’’ 
The Senate rule change he refers to 
is carving out the filibuster in order to 
pass one of the far left’s priorities; that 
is, the voting bill that many of my 
Members or colleagues have talked 
about today. 
But in 2018, the then-Senate minority 
leader struck a different tone. He said: 
The legislative filibuster . . . is the most 
important distinction between the Senate 
and the House. Without the 60-vote threshold 
for 
legislation, 
the 
Senate 
becomes 
a 
majoritarian institution like the House . . . 
no Senator would like to see that happen. 
What is the difference between today 
and only a few short years ago? Again, 
it is the party that is in power. 
This same pattern of situational 
principles also applies to the majority 
whip. He went on national television 
when Donald Trump was President to 
warn that eliminating the filibuster 
‘‘would be the end of the Senate as it 
was originally devised.’’ 
That is Senator DURBIN. 
But less than 4 years later, after 
Democrats won control of the White 
House and the Senate, the majority 
whip has a much different take. He re-
cently declared that ‘‘the filibuster is 
making a mockery of the American de-
mocracy.’’ He made that statement 
after he and his fellow Democrats used 
the filibuster a recordbreaking 328 
times between 2019 and 2020, when 
President Trump was in office. That 
level hypocrisy is audacious, even by 
Washington, DC, standards. 
And I know Democrats have been 
pushing back on this claim, claiming 
they are not trying to end the fili-
buster. They assure us that this is a 
one-time deal that will only apply to 
this one bill. 
I would refer them to Newton’s third 
law of physics: ‘‘For every action, 
there is an equal and opposite action.’’ 
It most definitely applies to Senate 
rules as well. 
In 2013, Senate Democrats invoked 
the nuclear option to end the 60-vote 
cloture requirement on judicial and 
Executive nominees other than the Su-
preme Court. All Republicans, and even 
a handful of Democrats, including the 
senior Senator from West Virginia, 
pleaded with the Democrats not to do 
it. 
Minority Leader MCCONNELL warned 
Democrats at the time that ‘‘you’ll re-
gret this, and you might regret it even 
sooner than you think.’’ But they did it 
anyway. And, indeed, there was that 
reaction. 
Four years later, Republicans con-
trolled the Senate, and we used the nu-
clear option to finish what our Demo-
cratic colleagues started on the execu-
tive calendar. We ended the 60-vote re-
quirement for Supreme Court nomi-
nees. 
There is a clear precedent on what 
happens when we change the Senate 
rules on a partisan basis for political 
expediency. It produces long-term con-
sequences that I believe both sides will 
ultimately regret. 
Democrats invoked the nuclear op-
tion to get more district judges, but by 
doing so, they paved the path for Jus-
tice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and 
Justice Barrett, who now sit on the Su-
preme Court today. 
What do we think now if the Demo-
crats nuke the filibuster for just one 
bill? The Senate rule change that the 
majority leader is pushing is really a 
proxy vote for ending the legislative 
filibuster altogether and turning the 
Senate into the House, full stop. 
So I ask my Democratic colleagues 
to 
consider 
this: 
When 
President 
Trump called for ending the filibuster, 
a large majority of Republican Sen-
ators stood up to preserve bipartisan-
ship and to protect and respect this in-
stitution. Now, the roles are reversed. 
President Biden and the majority lead-
er are demanding that you give them 
your vote to weaken the filibuster so it 
can ultimately be ended. 
To my Democratic colleagues who 
signed on to the very same letter I did 
in difficult circumstances, I ask you: 
Will you stand up for the principles 
that you stood for just a few years ago 
and respect and defend this institu-
tion? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I pre-
pared some remarks to give this 
evening, but I had the occasion to 
watch President Biden as he spoke in 
Georgia just a few minutes ago, and he 
said quite a number of things that sim-
ply weren’t true. He also accused a 
number of my good and principled col-
leagues in the Senate of having sin-
ister, 
even 
racist 
inclinations. 
He 
charged that voting against his bill al-
lies us with Bull Connor, George Wal-
lace, and Jefferson Davis—so much for 
unifying the country and working 
across the aisle. 
More troubling, however, he said that 
the goal of some Republicans is to 
‘‘turn the will of the voters into a mere 
suggestion.’’ And so President Biden 
goes down the same tragic road taken 
by President Trump: casting doubt on 
the reliability of American elections. 
This is a sad, sad day. I expected 
more of President Biden, who came 
into office with a stated goal of bring-
ing the country together. 
Now, our country has defied the odds 
for a democratic republic. It has sur-
vived and thrived for over 200 years. 
The character of the American people 
deserves most of the credit for that, 
but close behind are our vital institu-
tions. Over the last several years, 
many of us recoiled as foundational 
American institutions have been re-
peatedly demeaned: The judiciary was 
charged with racial bias. The press was 
called the enemy of the people. Justice 
and intelligence agencies were belit-
tled. Public health agencies were dis-
missed. Even our election system was 
accused of being rigged. 
The U.S. Senate is one of our vital 
democratic institutions, and the power 
given to the minority in the Senate 
and the resulting requirement for po-
litical consensus are among the Sen-
ate’s defining features. Note that in 
the Federal Government empowerment 
of the minority is established through 
only one institution: the Senate. 
The majority decides in the House. 
The majority decides in the Supreme 
Court. The President, of course, is a 
majority of one. Only in the Senate 
does the minority restrain the power of 
the majority. That a minority should 
be afforded such political power is a 
critical element of this institution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S142 
January 11, 2022 
For a law to pass in the Senate, it 
must appeal to Senators in both par-
ties. This virtually assures that the 
bill did not originate from the extreme 
wing of either one and, thus, best rep-
resents the interests of the broadest 
swath of Americans. The Senate’s mi-
nority empowerment has meant that 
America’s policies inevitably tack to-
wards the center. As Senator Biden 
previously affirmed: ‘‘At its core, the 
filibuster is not about stopping a nomi-
nee or a bill, it is about compromise 
and moderation.’’ 
Consider how different the Senate 
would be without the filibuster. When-
ever one party replaced the other as 
majority, tax and spending priorities 
would change, safety net programs 
would change, national security policy 
could change, cultural issues would ca-
reen from one extreme to the other— 
creating uncertainty and unpredict-
ability for families, for employers, and 
for our friends abroad. 
The need to marshal 60 votes requires 
compromise and middle ground. It em-
powers the minority. And it has helped 
to keep us centered as a nation, fos-
tering the stability and predictability 
that are essential for investments in 
people, in capital, and in the future. 
Abandoning the principle of minority 
empowerment 
would 
fundamentally 
change a distinct and essential role of 
the U.S. Senate. 
But today’s Democrats, now with the 
barest of majorities in a 50–50 Senate, 
conveniently ignore their own impas-
sioned defense of the filibuster when 
they were in the minority. Let us be 
clear that those who claim the fili-
buster is racist know better. 
For President Obama to make this 
absurd charge after he, himself, made a 
vigorous and extensive defense of the 
filibuster just a few years ago is both 
jarring and deeply disappointing. After 
all, I don’t recall a single claim from 
Democrats that employing the fili-
buster hundreds of times over the last 
several years when they were in the 
minority was in any way racist. 
Over the course of my life, I have 
found that when presented with a mat-
ter of personal advantage that would 
require 
abandoning 
principles, 
the 
human mind goes to work overtime to 
rationalize taking that advantage. 
Only a few months ago, some of my 
Senate Democratic colleagues rational-
ized that the Senate couldn’t function 
and, therefore, they had to get rid of 
the 60-vote rule. But then the Senate 
functioned quite well when it passed 
the infrastructure bill, armed services 
legislation, and a bill on innovation. 
So, a few months later, some of these 
colleagues argued that in order to raise 
the debt ceiling, the 60-vote rule has to 
go. Then, with bipartisan cooperation, 
the Senate raised the debt ceiling. 
So now, the Democrats’ latest ration-
alization is that their partisan new 
election law must be passed. But 
Democrats have filed these voting bills 
numerous times over numerous years, 
always without seeking Republican in-
volvement in drafting them. Anytime 
legislation is crafted and sponsored ex-
clusively by one party, it is obviously 
an unserious, partisan effort. 
Let me note two more truths. The 
country is sharply divided right now. 
Despite the truth spoken by a number 
of good people in my party, most Re-
publicans believe Donald Trump’s lie 
that the 2020 election was fraudulent, 
stolen by Democrats. That is almost 
half the country. 
Can you imagine the anger that 
would be ignited if they see Democrats 
alone rewrite, with no Republican in-
volvement whatsoever, the voting laws 
of the country? If you want to see divi-
sion and anger, the Democrats are 
heading down the right road. 
There is also a reasonable chance Re-
publicans will win both Houses in Con-
gress and that Donald Trump himself 
could once again be elected President 
in 2024. Have Democrats thought what 
it would mean for them for the Demo-
crat minority to have no power what-
soever? 
And finally, Mr. President, I offer 
this thought: How absurd is it to claim 
that, to save democracy, a party that 
represents barely half the country 
must trample on the rules of our de-
mocracy’s senior institution? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
with my distinguished colleague from 
Utah here, I would just—before I get to 
my remarks—suggest that there may 
be an exception to his rule that when a 
piece of legislation is only sponsored 
by Members of one party it can’t be se-
rious legislation; and, in my view, that 
would 
include 
climate 
legislation, 
where it has been extremely hard to 
get Republicans to cosponsor any seri-
ous climate bill. And I think that has 
nothing to do with the seriousness of 
the legislation and everything to do 
with the influence of the fossil fuel in-
dustry. 
But that said, Mr. President, I am 
here to speak for the 11th time in my 
series discussing the scheme through 
which a bunch of big, anonymous do-
nors captured our Supreme Court. 
Today, I am going to talk about the 
Biden 
Supreme 
Court 
commission, 
which could have done a useful, even 
authoritative 
investigation 
of 
the 
scheme and all its terrible effects at 
the 
Court 
but 
which, 
regrettably, 
ended up as an exercise in ineffectual 
time-killing. 
I have laid out the scheme in detail 
in earlier speeches in this series. In a 
nutshell, there is a very well-studied 
phenomenon of regulatory capture, 
sometimes 
called 
agency 
capture, 
through which big industries try to 
capture and control the regulatory 
agencies that are supposed to be polic-
ing them. 
Well, in the same way, big, rightwing 
donor interests set out to capture the 
Supreme Court. And they did it. It 
worked. Now, the Court’s 6-to-3, big- 
donor-chosen supermajority is deliv-
ering massive wins for those donor in-
terests, and the American people can 
smell what Justice Sotomayor aptly 
characterized as the ‘‘stench’’ of a cap-
tured Court. 
The problems of the Court are real, 
and they demand action. Enter the 
Court commission. Charged with think-
ing through solutions to the Court’s 
many problems, the commission was 
perfectly positioned to report on the 
scheme and offer a blueprint for restor-
ing the Court. But its final findings, re-
leased last month, offered instead what 
I have called faculty-lounge pabulum. 
Sure, yes, they gestured toward the 
need for a code of ethics for the Jus-
tices, which makes sense because Su-
preme Court Justices have the lowest 
ethics standard of any top Federal offi-
cial. But pointing that out is a little 
bit like pointing out a flat tire on a to-
taled car. 
Consider the facts the commission ig-
nored: A private, partisan, anony-
mously funded organization—the Fed-
eralist Society—handpicked the last 
three Supreme Court Justices. Presi-
dent Trump and his White House coun-
sel admitted they had ‘‘in-sourced’’— 
their word—the Federalist Society to 
the White House to choose their nomi-
nees. 
Senator Hatch, our former colleague, 
former chairman of the Judiciary, was 
asked if this role was outsourced to the 
Federalist Society, and he said, ‘‘Damn 
right.’’ 
No other democracy in the world has 
had such a ridiculous system for select-
ing Judges. That is bad. It gets worse. 
Anonymous donations helped right-
wing front groups mount a $400 million 
push to capture and control the Court 
with zero transparency into who gave 
the 
money 
or—more 
importantly— 
what matters they had before the 
Court whose Justices they were install-
ing. That is disgraceful. And trust me, 
nobody spends $400 million without a 
motive. 
There is more. Orchestrated flotillas 
of amici curiae, so-called friends of the 
court, funded by dark money, instruct 
the Court which way to rule, and they 
score virtually perfect success with the 
Republican 
appointees 
whom 
dark 
money ushered onto the Court. 
The Court has even allowed peculiar 
fast lanes for dark money groups to 
speed cases to the Court for Justices to 
decide 
favored, 
politically 
helpful 
cases. In some cases, the Justices even 
invited the case to be rushed to the 
Court. 
And this mess culminates in a nota-
ble, troubling statistical record. The 
Roberts Court delivered more than 80— 
80—partisan 5-to-4 decisions benefiting 
big Republican donor interests. The 
record in that category of decisions 
was 80 to 0, and that is before the 
Court’s new 6–3, donor-chosen super-
majority. 
That is a lot for the Commission to 
leave out. The Commissioners can’t 
claim they did not have fair notice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S143 
January 11, 2022 
Several of us wrote to the Commission 
to point out the scheme’s telltale foot-
prints. The Commission even received 
testimony about another pernicious 
issue: the Court’s reliance on fake facts 
supplied by dark money amici curiae, 
especially 
in 
politically 
important 
cases for the rightwing donors like 
Shelby County and Citizens United. 
Somehow, none of this made it into the 
Commission’s discussion. 
Ducking all these facts was no small 
feat. As the Presiding Officer knows, 
one of the first exercises that law pro-
fessors give their first-year law stu-
dents is called issue spotting. You get 
a case, and you are asked to go through 
it and list all the potential issues it 
raises, spot the issues. Well, these 
issues all sat in plain view before the 
Commission. 
Yet 
the 
Commission 
flunked the rudimentary law school 
test of issue spotting. 
Now, part of the problem was conflict 
of interest. Many members of this 
Commission argue before the Court and 
need its good will for their bread and 
butter. Others are law professors eager 
to plant their students in prestigious 
Supreme Court clerkships. For many 
members, rocking the boat could have 
unhappy consequences. 
Clearly, though, some Commission 
members tried and failed to get these 
issues considered. Two members—re-
tired Federal Judge Nancy Gertner 
from the Presiding Officer’s home 
State and Harvard Law School’s Lau-
rence Tribe—had an op-ed ready for 
print the day the report was released. 
They called for a serious overhaul of 
the Court due to what they called ‘‘the 
dubious legitimacy of the way some 
Justices were appointed,’’ due to that 
stench 
of 
bipartisanship 
Justice 
Sotomayor has observed, and due to 
what they called the ‘‘anti-egalitarian 
direction’’ of the Court’s political deci-
sions 
on 
voting 
rights 
and 
dark 
money.’’ 
Judge Gertner and Professor Tribe 
wrote: 
Though fellow commissioners and others 
have voiced concern about the impact that a 
report implicitly criticizing the Supreme 
Court might have on judicial independence 
and thus judicial legitimacy, we do not share 
that concern. Far worse are the dangers that 
flow from ignoring the court’s real prob-
lems—of pretending conditions have not 
changed; of insisting improper efforts to ma-
nipulate the court’s membership have not 
taken place; of looking the other way when 
the court seeks to undo decades of precedent 
relied on by half the population to shape 
their lives just because, given the new ma-
jority, it has the votes. 
Judge Gertner and Professor Tribe 
rightly warned that we can’t afford 
more decisions like Shelby County and 
Citizens United, which would put the 
Court on what they called a ‘‘one-way 
trip from a defective but still hopeful 
democracy toward a system in which 
the few corruptly govern the many, 
something between autocracy and oli-
garchy.’’ 
Think about that. People distin-
guished enough to be appointed to this 
Commission by the President feel that 
this Court is on a one-way trip from 
America being a defective but still 
hopeful democracy toward a system in 
which the few corruptly govern the 
many. 
They concluded by saying this: 
Instead of serving as a guardrail against 
going over that cliff, our Supreme Court has 
become an all-too-willing accomplice— 
Accomplice— 
in that disaster. 
All of that was kept out of the re-
port. 
The fact is evident that dark money 
political forces had a controlling and 
anonymous role in the makeup of the 
present Court. You can’t dispute that. 
It is not surprising that the donor in-
terests who accomplished that should 
want their due. As I said, you don’t 
spend $400 million on this scheme for 
nothing. 
Just a few days before the Commis-
sion unveiled the final draft of its re-
port and right after oral arguments in 
the big abortion cases that are pending 
before the Court, there was a telling in-
cident. FOX News host Laura Ingraham 
lost her cool, and she said on plain tel-
evision the quiet part out loud. Here is 
what she said: 
We have six Republican appointees on this 
court, after all the money that has been 
raised, the Federalist Society, all these big 
fat cat dinners—I’m sorry, I’m pissed about 
this— 
Excuse me for that language, but it 
is a direct quote— 
if this court with six justices cannot do the 
right thing here . . . then I think it’s time to 
do what Robert Bork said we should do, 
which is to circumscribe the jurisdiction of 
this court and if they want to blow it up, 
then that’s the way to change things finally. 
Let’s deconstruct that little outburst 
for a second. 
First, it basically admits to the 
scheme: ‘‘all the money that has been 
raised’’—that is the $400 million I 
talked about; ‘‘the Federalist Soci-
ety’’—that is the big donor-controlled 
turnstile for rightwing advancement to 
the Supreme Court; and ‘‘all these big 
fat cat dinners’’—wow. I would love to 
know more about that. We do know 
that Justices have taken undisclosed 
vacations in the company of people 
with interests before the Court, so 
what is a little ‘‘big fat cat dinner’’ 
among friends, huh? 
Second, that little outburst is a flat- 
out threat to the Court: Decide the big 
abortion cases the way we want, the six 
of you, or we ‘‘circumscribe the juris-
diction of this court’’; ‘‘blow it up’’; 
‘‘change things finally.’’ 
There is a particularly thin-skinned 
Federalist Society Justice who has 
been giving speeches condemning an 
imaginary threat I supposedly made to 
‘‘bully’’ the Court in a brief maybe 
read by a couple of hundred people. It 
didn’t actually happen that way, but 
never mind. Like I said, he is particu-
larly thin-skinned. 
But now here comes this plain 
threat: ‘‘circumscribe the jurisdiction 
of this court’’; ‘‘blow it up’’; ‘‘change 
things finally’’ if we don’t get the out-
come we deserve after all of our money 
spent through the Federalist Society. 
So I am waiting to see what reaction 
from this Justice there is when this 
real threat comes, but from the right-
wing FOX News channel. The FOX 
News outburst was particularly rash 
and indiscreet, but the Republican Jus-
tices get marching orders like this all 
the time at the fat-cat dinners, on jun-
kets with the rightwing donor class, 
and from the orchestrated flotillas of 
dark money amici curiae that encircle 
the Court for big cases launched by the 
big donors. 
The Justices are constantly reminded 
of who propelled them to the Court and 
what they are supposed to deliver. And 
the truth is, the record reveals, the 
statistics make plain the Republican 
Justices do deliver over and over and 
over again—more than 80 partisan wins 
for scheme donors in those 5-to-4—and 
now we can expect 6-to-3—partisan de-
cisions. 
So the Biden Court Commission 
missed its moment. It ducked all of 
this. So on we must go through the 
stench of partisan capture of the Court, 
and on I will go exposing the scheme 
that did it. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
there has been a lot of discussion on 
the floor, certainly today and the days 
leading up to this, as we talk about the 
importance 
of 
protecting 
minority 
rights here in the Senate and the con-
sequences of weakening the legislative 
filibuster to a 50-vote, majority-serving 
threshold. There is a lot to say, and 
there has been a lot said already. 
I was here listening to the comments 
from my friend from Utah and have 
had an opportunity to hear much of 
what has been said throughout the 
course of the day. But I am here per-
haps as the sole Senate Republican who 
will vote to begin debate on the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
because I happen to believe that it is 
important that we focus on improving 
our election laws, but I also believe 
very, very strongly that the way to do 
that is through the regular order proc-
ess. It might sound kind of boring, but 
that is actually how you get the good 
work, the enduring legislation done. 
I am also here, I guess, as a senior 
Member of the Chamber now. I have 
been around for almost 20 years. I have 
spent time in both the majority and 
the minority. But I am also here be-
cause I care—I really care—about legis-
lating. I understand what it takes to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S144 
January 11, 2022 
work across the aisle to bring good pol-
icy into law. 
One of the things that I can tell you 
from firsthand experience is, it is hard. 
It is hard work. It is hard work to 
bring people together, particularly on 
some of these challenging and difficult 
issues that we have. 
When the problems are hard, that 
means usually the solutions are equal-
ly hard. But that is our job as legisla-
tors—to bring sides together, to find 
that common ground. 
That is what legislating is all about. 
And so with all of that in mind, I tell 
you I believe that weakening the cur-
rent 60-vote threshold would be a major 
mistake, a damaging mistake, espe-
cially in light of the already deep divi-
sion that we have within our country 
today and within the divisions that we 
have represented in this body today. 
So the nuclear option is reportedly 
coming our way to change the thresh-
old for cloture on legislation—on legis-
lation to 50 votes and to do this with 
just 50 votes. But I would suggest to 
you that this will do nothing to cure 
what actually ails the Senate, and, 
therefore, we should reject it. 
I mentioned that the job that we 
have as legislators is to come together 
to knit the good ideas from one side to 
the other, to really build that con-
sensus that will allow for enduring pol-
icy and enduring laws. Gutting the fili-
buster is not going to do anything to 
bring both sides together. It will not 
help bring the parties together. It will, 
unfortunately, just serve to push them 
further apart, split us further apart. It 
would not lead to better or consensus 
legislation. 
It effectively allows the majority to 
do what it wants to do, when it wants 
to do it, how it wants to do it without 
the minority. It effectively allows you 
to ignore the views from the minority. 
This rule change would not restore us 
as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. 
I know that there are those who 
would suggest that we are far, far from 
that, but I would suggest that if we do 
this, it really obliterates that reputa-
tion forever. 
There has been a lot of talk about 
the differences between the House and 
the Senate. We are different. We were 
designed different. The Framers de-
signed the Senate as an institution 
where the rights of individual Senators 
as well as minority groups of Senators 
are protected. They are highly pro-
tected. That is what our rules reflect. 
And that is why—why we can hold 
forth, why an individual—one person— 
can register objections, why we can 
place holds and offer motions and fili-
buster legislation when we deem it nec-
essary. And I know we don’t like it 
when it is being used against us—we 
don’t—because it slows things down. It 
is frustrating. But it is part of what 
has been built into our institution. 
And some may say, well, it is obvi-
ously not working, it is obviously not 
functioning because I can’t get my pri-
ority through. Perhaps we need to 
focus on how we are bringing people to-
gether to advance that priority. 
This body, the Senate, was never 
meant to be the House of Representa-
tives. Senator Robert Byrd, who served 
both as the majority and the minority 
leader—so I think he had pretty good 
perspective 
on 
things—he 
also 
re-
minded us about the saucer and the 
role that the House plays—excuse me, 
that the Senate plays. 
The Senate is the proverbial saucer 
intended to cool the cup of coffee from 
the House. Nobody likes it, particu-
larly the guys in the House. They don’t 
like it when they say: Oh, you are so 
slow over here. But we were meant to 
be deliberative. 
The more we become like the House, 
the less relevant, in my view, we are as 
an institution and the further we will 
have strayed from that balance, that 
careful balance that the Constitution 
envisions for our branch of govern-
ment. 
So we have been here before. As I was 
walking over, I was thinking this is 
like deja vu all over again. How many 
times have we had these battles over 
the filibuster? Should we exercise the 
nuclear option? Should we pull this 
trigger? 
Well, back in 2017, I signed a letter, 
along with 60 other Members of this 
Chamber. There were 28 Republicans, 32 
Democrats, 1 Independent. We came to-
gether as a pretty representative group 
of lawmakers, and we urged both Re-
publican and Democratic leaders to 
preserve the 60-vote threshold for legis-
lation—for 
legislation—because 
we 
knew where we had come from. The Re-
publicans had used the nuclear option 
to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme 
Court nominees after the Democrats 
used it in 2013 for eliminating the fili-
buster for confirmation of the lower 
court and executive branch. 
So it is kind of one of these where 
they did it, so it is OK for us to do it. 
Far be it for me to suggest that some-
times the analogies are like what we 
have when we have got the kids in the 
back of the car and somebody says: 
Well, he started it. And the other one 
says: No, well, then I get to do it. And 
my response is: Knock it off both of 
you. 
Maybe we just need to have a detente 
here on whether or not we blow up the 
filibuster. Maybe we need to just step 
back from this and realize what it 
means to all of us because those of us 
who are in the minority today will one 
day be in the majority, and those who 
are in the majority today will one day 
be in the minority. 
And so making sure that there is a 
balance, that it works, that minority 
rights are respected—this is why we 
are here today. I know that there are 
several Senators who signed that letter 
back in 2017 who are now seeing their 
words repeated against them. That has 
got to feel pretty uncomfortable. I 
don’t want to be one of those who feels 
like I have to eat my words; that what 
was good for me when I was in the mi-
nority is no longer good for me when I 
am in the majority or vice versa. It has 
to work both ways. 
So when as Republicans in the major-
ity we were urged mightily by former 
President Trump to get rid of the fili-
buster, I was one of those who said: No. 
No. We should not do that. And that is 
why my advice today to the majority is 
be careful, be careful what you wish for 
because you may look at this and say 
this may help advance the immediate 
legislative agenda—what they are talk-
ing about now is voting rights. You 
may be able to advance the immediate 
legislative agenda there, but the long- 
term effects might look pretty dif-
ferent. 
And I think we have seen a little bit 
of a suggestion of what that could look 
like when you don’t have the protec-
tions in order for the minority. So I 
think it is good for us to be having this 
open discussion. I think it is important 
that we be thinking about the practical 
effects of weakening the filibuster. 
What will happen if it no longer pro-
tects the minority and instead only 
serves to benefit the majority? A 50- 
vote threshold would allow the major-
ity to push through, to rush through 
legislation without consideration of 
the minority views. And keep in mind 
that we may be in the minority now, a 
50–50 minority—pretty skinny minor-
ity—but a minority that is elected 
with support from major portions of 
the country. 
Removing the filibuster would reduce 
the need for the parties to work to-
gether to reach the broad consensus on 
policy, again, that can endure across 
elections. And I think that is impor-
tant for us to just stop and take ac-
count of because when you don’t have 
legislation that is enduring, when you 
move legislation that is wholly par-
tisan, what happens when the tables 
are turned? The new majority spends 
all of its time trying to undo what the 
old majority got passed on a wholly 
partisan basis. 
Now we are not giving certainty to 
the Nation. We are not helping the 
economy move along. It is a whipsaw. 
It is policy whiplash. Who is going to 
be investing in policies if they just 
think that what was just passed into 
law is going to be undone in the next 
Congress? 
We owe it to our constituents, we 
owe it to the country to give them 
some certainty with policy, and that 
comes about when you are working to 
build consensus. 
Eliminating 
the 
filibuster 
would 
make primary elections into fealty 
tests, even more, even more than they 
already are, as each party sets its 
sights on candidates who are probably 
unlikely to act independently once in 
office. I mean, why bother? But, again, 
it would whipsaw—whipsaw—the coun-
try on policy. And as I think about the 
state of our economy right now, where 
we need to be investing in—we have got 
a great infrastructure bill that we are

all poised to try to advance, lots of 
good things coming for that—we don’t 
want to be undermining investment in 
our ability to address major challenges 
if we are looking at a situation where, 
again, the new majority coming in, 
they just work to reverse the work of 
their predecessors. 
These aren’t good outcomes for a di-
vided nation, and they only take us 
further from what should be our goal. 
We have got to be focused. We have got 
to be focused on finding more ways to 
work together. And we have got good 
examples. We had an energy bill that 
we advanced in 2020, a good bill. We had 
been working on that for a long time, 
but it was a very bipartisan product. 
I mentioned our bipartisan infra-
structure bill. We have the CARES Act 
as another example. So many measures 
have shown us that this is absolutely 
possible. 
As part of that, when we consider 
changing the rules, we need to focus on 
incentivizing bipartisanship, pushing 
Members to reach across the aisle, not 
making it less of a priority. Let’s think 
about how we do that in a positive 
sense, how we are pushing one another 
to work to build things rather than di-
viding one another and just throwing 
things at one another. 
I will vote against any motion to 
weaken the filibuster or create carve- 
outs within it. Legislation and legis-
lating in and of itself, as I mentioned 
at the outset, it is not supposed to be 
easy. We don’t have that red ‘‘easy’’ 
button on our desk here. It is delib-
erately hard. 
But as I learned from somebody a 
couple weeks ago, I don’t want to come 
to talk about the problems without of-
fering up some solutions at the same 
time. I do have some suggestions for 
how we could perhaps move forward on 
voting 
rights 
legislation, 
potential 
changes to our rules. So for voting 
rights, the Senate doesn’t need to 
change its rules here; the majority 
needs to change its approach. 
You have me—basically me alone at 
this point—willing to debate one of the 
measures that was written. It was writ-
ten on a partisan basis, but I did my 
homework. I looked at it. I weighed in. 
I worked with colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle and made some good, 
solid suggestions. I think we have had 
some good dialogue there. I think it is 
important. I want to reach a com-
promise on it. I think that that would 
be important, but I have acknowledged 
that there needs to be some changes 
that would need to be made to that, 
and I have worked to suggest it. 
But what that does for right here 
right now is it makes it abundantly 
clear that we don’t have agreement 
right now on voting rights legislation, 
so it is no wonder that the legislation 
is being blocked. 
Partisan bills don’t suddenly become 
bipartisan just because they have hit 
the floor. So instead of looking for 
ways around consensus, we have got to 
go back; we have got to actually start 
building it. 
So let’s take this back. Let’s take it 
to the committee process. Let’s look 
for areas of agreement, like some sug-
gestion has been out in the past couple 
weeks here, reforming the Electoral 
Count Act. I don’t know how far that 
can take us, but when something like 
this is put on the table, let’s take a 
look at this. 
Let’s work through some of these 
proposals rather than just summarily 
dismissing it out of hand. Let’s take 
that time, put in the effort, build a 
product that can pass and hopefully by 
more than just the smallest of mar-
gins. We did that before with Voting 
Rights Act historically. We have dem-
onstrated that it can be done. 
As far as rule changes, I agree we 
should be having the debate. But how 
we do the debate, I think, is also im-
portant. We want to have a thoughtful 
discussion. Both sides need to be in-
volved. Any Member who wants to par-
ticipate should be doing so. 
But these discussions need to focus 
on the problem, and the problem is 
that there is not enough consensus 
building across parties. That is what 
we need to be focusing on, rather than 
focusing on eliminating the need for it 
altogether. 
So instead of targeting the filibuster, 
one of the things that I have suggested 
to several folks is the development of a 
consensus calendar. Now, I am not say-
ing it is going to solve everything, but 
if you have strong, bipartisan bills that 
have made it through the process, they 
have demonstrated that good, strong 
show of support, there ought to be a 
way that we can move things through 
on an expedited process, an expedited 
consideration. 
There has also been a lot of talk 
about eliminating the filibuster on the 
motion to proceed. 
So these are areas where, again, I 
think you have had thoughtful people 
willing to sit down and say: Can we re-
form our processes around here? Can 
we be more efficient? Can we still be 
that cooling saucer, that deliberative 
body, but be more efficient? 
I would argue that no rules changes 
should take effect this year. Whatever 
we can agree to, let’s set the effective 
date of January of 2023. Make these de-
cisions based on what any majority in 
any year should have to govern. 
We need to make sure that if we are 
changing the rules, we do it for the 
right reason. We do it because it is the 
right thing to do for the Senate, no 
matter who is in charge. And I think 
that is just a matter of fairness there. 
We all know that filibusters can be so 
very, very frustrating, and those in the 
majority feel it directly. I know of 
which I speak. I have been there. It can 
be agonizing. It is like you are up 
against a brick wall. 
As I mentioned, when we were ad-
vancing my energy bill several years 
back, I can’t tell you how many times 
I felt like I had the rug pulled out from 
underneath us. But it was a good legis-
lative product, and so we didn’t give 
up. We kept working at it. And, in fair-
ness, I think we actually worked to im-
prove the legislation. 
As difficult as it might have been, it 
was through that process that we were 
able to come to some terms on HFCs, 
probably as significant an effort that 
we have made when it comes to reduc-
ing emissions, and that came about as 
a result of that very deliberative proc-
ess that you wanted to pull your hair 
out over, but it actually worked to ad-
vance that legislation. 
But I think what happens is this 
forces us, as Members, to work to-
gether and to remember we can over-
come these. And in these partisan 
times, they prevent the majority from 
simply running over the minority, 
which only serves to worsen our polit-
ical divide. 
The 60-vote threshold for legislation 
requires consensus to be part of the 
legislative strategy. Changing it to 50 
votes to serve the narrowest possible 
majority will lose that essential ben-
efit; it will have lasting consequences 
for the Senate and for the people that 
we serve. 
So I absolutely think that we can do 
better than this, better approaches for 
both voting rights legislation and rules 
changes. They are available to us. We 
just have to work. Neither side is going 
to get everything that it wants out of 
them, but I absolutely believe that we 
will be better served, our country will 
be better served if we have a bipartisan 
path working together. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to congratulate and 
commend the remarks by the senior 
Senator from Alaska. She certainly 
knows from whence she speaks. 
I remember so well the discussion 
that she just mentioned with regard to 
the energy bill and HRCs and the effort 
for a cleaner environment, and it was 
through the process that we were able 
to come up with legislation that we be-
lieve—all believe—was a better result 
for the Nation and for the environ-
ment. 
It took longer than any of us wish it 
would have taken, but it was through 
that process. And had we been in a sit-
uation without the ability to filibuster, 
we would have never gotten to such a 
good result because a 50–50 Senate is— 
basically it is a mandate to move to 
the middle. 
So I commend the senior Senator 
from Alaska. She knows from whence 
she speaks. She is very high up in se-
niority in the institution. She has in-
stitutional memory, more than many, 
many Members of this body, and when 
she says what goes around comes 
around and the shoe is, at another 
time, on the opposite foot, she knows 
what the implications of those are and 
why what the Democrats are proposing 
now is in the wrong direction for the 
country. 
So I believe it is misguided, and I 
concur with her comments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S146 
January 11, 2022 
NORD STREAM 2 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today on another matter, and that is to 
support sanctions on Vladimir Putin 
and his Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
This body will be voting on that very 
issue in the next day or so, and I am 
urging my colleagues to support S. 
3436, which is known as Protecting Eu-
rope’s Energy Security Implementa-
tion Act. 
Let me just explain why this is so 
important. And it is important because 
right now, Vladimir Putin has mobi-
lized close to 100,000 troops near the 
border with Ukraine. They are nearly 
encircling the country of Ukraine. Our 
intelligence community has warned of 
a 
potential 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine in the next month or so. 
So why is this happening? Well, 
Vladimir Putin has always wanted to 
control and dominate Ukraine. This is 
nothing new. He invaded in 2014. He il-
legally annexed Crimea and continues 
to occupy Crimea today. Now, he wants 
more, and he is now also flush with 
cash. With Joe Biden in the White 
House and the Democrat energy poli-
cies, Vladimir Putin has hit the energy 
financial jackpot. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it; take it from the Biden administra-
tion. Joe Biden’s Under Secretary of 
State for Political Affairs is one of his 
top Russia experts for our own State 
Department. She has spent her entire 
career working on issues related to 
Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. 
Well, in December, she testified be-
fore the Foreign Relations Committee. 
She testified about increasing Russian 
aggression on the Ukraine border. She 
said, ‘‘Energy is the cash cow that en-
ables these kinds of military deploy-
ments.’’ 
She said Vladimir Putin ‘‘needs the 
energy to flow as much as the con-
sumers need’’ it to flow. 
But why is that? Well, it is because 
of Russian energy that Putin is able to 
pursue these dangerous military ambi-
tions. 
The late Senator John McCain, with 
whom I have traveled on several occa-
sions to Ukraine, used to say, ‘‘Russia 
is a Mafia-run gas company disguised 
as a country.’’ 
Energy is the only successful sector 
of the Russian economy. Natural gas is 
what is propping up the Russian mili-
tary and the entire Putin regime. 
Vladimir Putin uses energy as a geo-
political weapon, and he knows how to 
use it. 
He uses energy to coerce and to ma-
nipulate our allies and our partners in 
Europe. If they don’t do something 
that Putin wants or they do something 
that he doesn’t like, he can turn off the 
power and turn off the heat. We just 
saw an example of this in November, 
when Russia threatened to cut off gas 
flows to the small and neighboring 
country of Moldova. Moldova had to 
declare a state of emergency. 
Well, under Joe Biden’s energy poli-
cies, Europe will soon be in a state of 
energy emergency as well. It is because 
Europe already gets almost half of its 
gas imports from Russia. With the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to 
Germany, the imports will only need to 
go up, and they will go up. 
Under 
Secretary 
Victoria 
Nuland 
told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, ‘‘We have been counseling 
Europe for almost a decade now to re-
duce its dependence on Russian en-
ergy.’’ 
A decade. A decade includes the ad-
ministrations of both President Trump 
and President Obama. Yet Joe Biden 
has done everything he can to cripple 
American energy production. 
What happens with that? Well, it 
makes our allies more dependent on 
Russia for energy. It gives more power 
to Putin. 
Under Joe Biden, American energy 
production hasn’t really recovered yet 
to the 2019 levels. This is a direct result 
of the anti-American energy policies of 
this White House. 
On his first day in office, Joe Biden 
killed the Keystone XL pipeline. He 
then blocked new oil and gas leases on 
Federal lands. We are now producing 
1.4 million fewer barrels of oil each day 
than we were before the pandemic. 
We are, in the U.S., now, using more 
oil imported from Russia than we are 
using oil from our own home State of 
Alaska. It is a national disgrace to be 
dependent more upon Russia for oil 
than we are from our neighboring 
State of Alaska. 
Joe Biden’s National Security Advi-
sor 
even 
pleaded 
with 
Russia 
to 
produce more oil—hard to believe, hard 
to believe that the National Security 
Advisor for Joe Biden in the White 
House would plead with Russia to 
produce more oil. 
Well, the administration actually put 
the Russian energy request on the 
White House website. Joe Biden would 
rather have America buy energy from 
our enemies than sell energy to our 
friends. 
Joe Biden would rather have Euro-
pean nations dependent on Russian en-
ergy than increase American energy 
production and exports from home here 
to our allies. It is completely back-
wards. 
Under Joe Biden, American energy 
production is down and energy prices, 
as any consumer knows, is way up. 
American families are caught paying 
the price for these policies of the 
Democrats and the Biden administra-
tion. 
In November, we saw the biggest en-
ergy price increase in 10 years. CNBC 
reports that one in five American fami-
lies can’t afford to pay an energy bill 
this year. Roughly the same percent-
age have kept their home at an 
unhealthy low temperature because 
they can’t afford the cost to heat their 
home. People who traveled for Christ-
mas just faced some of the highest 
Christmas Day gasoline prices in his-
tory. American families are getting 
squeezed, and Putin is getting rich. 
Joe Biden is against American pipe-
lines, but in May, he gave a green light 
to Vladimir Putin’s pipeline between 
Russia and Germany. This is a betrayal 
of American energy workers. It is a be-
trayal of America’s allies in Europe. 
If the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is com-
pleted, it will double the amount of 
Russian natural gas flowing into Ger-
many. Putin will be able to manipulate 
the price and the availability of energy 
to European nations in the middle of 
winter. He will be able to hold half of 
Europe hostage. 
Stopping this pipeline should be an 
area of bipartisan agreement in this 
body. In fact, it was an area of bipar-
tisan agreement until Joe Biden be-
came President. Even Joe Biden said 
that he was against the pipeline—well, 
until he was for it. 
Many Democrats voted for the sanc-
tions against the pipeline on more than 
one occasion, but when Joe Biden flip- 
flopped, so did they. 
Senate Democrats now are running 
interference for Joe Biden. But Demo-
crats just spent 4 years talking about 
Russia, Russia, Russia—obsessed with 
Russia. They spent 4 years going on 
TV, spreading conspiracy theories, all 
of which were false. 
Yet now, the Democrat caucus is at-
tempting to protect the Kremlin’s 
greatest geopolitical weapon. 
For the Democratic Party, this is a 
return to tradition. Democrats were 
soft on Russia during the Cold War, 
soft on Russia under the Obama admin-
istration. Hillary Clinton gave the Rus-
sians a great big reset button. Presi-
dent Obama was caught in a hot-micro-
phone moment telling the Russian 
President at the time that he would 
have more flexibility: Tell Vladimir I 
will have more flexibility after I am re-
elected. 
Democrats 
talk 
tough—they 
did 
under the last administration, that is. 
But now we are back to the old Demo-
cratic playbook. This is the kind of 
Washington, 
DC, 
partisanship 
the 
American people hate—the same thing 
Democrats did with Iran when Barack 
Obama was in the White House. 
An American President must always 
negotiate from a position of strength. 
Democrats tend to think if you give 
Putin or the Ayatollah something they 
demand, that they will then play nice. 
That is not how the real world works. 
Vladimir Putin is cunning, he is oppor-
tunistic, and he is aggressive. He sees 
an opportunity, and he takes it. He can 
smell weakness. He respects strength, 
not statements. 
The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline from 
Russia to Germany will be an enor-
mous transfer of wealth from our allies 
to our enemy. It will make our allies 
weaker, and, of course, it will make 
Vladimir Putin stronger. When Putin 
gets stronger, he gets even more ag-
gressive. 
History should not be kind to those 
who gifted Putin a pipeline, pointed 
like a gun into the heart of Europe. 
This vote to support sanctions on the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline is our chance

to undo a great mistake, and it may 
also be our chance to prevent an even 
greater mistake. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
RECOGNIZING THE NDSU 2022 NCAA DIVISION II 
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the 2022 Football Cham-
pionship Subdivision national cham-
pions, the North Dakota State Univer-
sity Bison. 
This past weekend, North Dakotans 
once again filled Toyota Stadium in 
Frisco, TX, where the NDSU Bison 
seized their 17th NCAA championship, 
earning victory over the Montana 
State University Bobcats by a score of 
38 to 10. 
I had the opportunity to join Bison 
Nation in Frisco to cheer on the team, 
and, as always, the fans created an 
overwhelming atmosphere of support 
and team spirit. 
At the same time, the Bobcats should 
come away from the game with pride, 
having capped off a successful season. 
The Bison have now won 9 of the past 
11 FCS championships—an achieve-
ment that goes unmatched in modern 
collegiate football history. 
Further, 
this 
victory followed a 
strong season for the Bison, where they 
had a 14-win and 1-loss record—a con-
tinuation of a decades’ worth of excel-
lence and skill. Since 2011, the NDSU 
Bison have had 149 wins to only 12 
losses, which includes a streak of 39 
consecutive wins. Such a record stands 
as a testament to the hard work and 
dedication of the players and staff, in-
cluding Head Coach Matt Entz. 
Accordingly, I am joining with my 
colleague Senator CRAMER to introduce 
a resolution honoring the NDSU Bi-
son’s achievements. We congratulate 
all of the players, coaches, and univer-
sity leadership, including Athletic Di-
rector Matt Larsen, NDSU President 
Dean Bresciani, and others, on building 
this tremendously successful program. 
We recognize the important support of 
Bison Nation, which helps drive this 
team to victory year after year. 
The NDSU Bison are the pride of 
North Dakota. Their accomplishments, 
character, and work ethic represent 
the very best of our State. We say con-
gratulations again to the national 
champions, and, as always, we say: Go 
Bison. 
I ask unanimous consent to have the 
resolution printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
RESOLUTION 
Congratulating the North Dakota State 
University Bison football team for winning 
the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Division I Football Championship 
Subdivision title. 
Whereas, the North Dakota State Univer-
sity 
(referred 
to 
in 
this 
preamble 
as 
‘‘NDSU’’) Bison football team won the 2022 
National Collegiate Athletic Association (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘NCAA’’) 
Division I Football Championship Subdivi-
sion (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘FCS’’) title game 1n Frisco, TX, on January 
8, 2022, in a well-fought victory over the 
Montana State University Bobcats by a 
score of 38 to 10; 
Whereas, including the 2022 NCAA Division 
I FCS title, the NDSU Bison football team 
has won 17 national football championships; 
Whereas, the NDSU Bison football team 
has won 9 of the last 11 NCAA Division I FCS 
titles, an achievement that continues to be 
unmatched in modern collegiate football his-
tory; 
Whereas, the NDSU Bison have displayed 
tremendous resilience and skill since 2011, 
with 149 wins to only 12 losses, including a 
streak of 39 consecutive wins; 
Whereas, head coach Matt Entz and his 
staff led the NDSU Bison football team to a 
dominant season and a second championship 
in his 3 years as head coach at NDSU, con-
tinuing the NDSU Bison football program’s 
culture of excellence; 
Whereas, thousands of Bison fans once 
again attended the championship game in 
Frisco, TX, reflecting the tremendous pride 
and dedication of Bison Nation, which has 
supported and helped drive the achievement 
of the NDSU Bison football team; and 
Whereas, the 2022 NCAA Division I FCS 
title was a victory for both the NDSU Bison 
football team and the entire State of North 
Dakota: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the North Dakota State 
University Bison football team for winning 
the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Division I FCS title; 
(2) commends the players, coaches, and 
staff of the North Dakota State University 
Bison football team for— 
(A) their tireless work and dedication; and 
(B) fostering a continued tradition of ex-
cellence; 
(3) congratulates North Dakota State Uni-
versity President Dean Bresciani, North Da-
kota State University Athletic Director 
Matt Larsen, and all the faculty and staff of 
North Dakota State University for creating 
an environment that emphasizes excellence 
in both academics and athletics; and 
(4) recognizes the students, alumni, fans, 
and all of Bison Nation for supporting the 
North Dakota State University Bison foot-
ball team so well during its successful quest 
to bring home yet another NCAA Division I 
FCS trophy for North Dakota State Univer-
sity. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, before I 
turn to my colleague Senator CRAMER, 
I want to mention that I was at the na-
tional championship game. It was just 
fantastic. 
As I say, Bison Nation, which is all 
our Bison fans from North Dakota and 
across the country, and the coaches, 
the staff, President Bresciani, and, of 
course, these great student athletes 
who had such a wonderful game—it was 
a great show. They turned out in force 
in Frisco, TX. We are starting to call 
Frisco Fargo South, which is actually 
the name of one of the high schools up 
in Fargo, which is kind of fun. But our 
fans travelled down there so well, filled 
the stadium, and they did once again. 
It was just a wonderful atmosphere. It 
was on national television, so they per-
formed on a national stage, and people 
from across the country got to watch a 
wonderful game. 
But leading up to that game, in the 
semifinals, they played James Madison 
University, which has a tremendous 
football program as well. That was on 
a Friday night, and it was the Friday 
night where we were last here several 
weeks ago voting until about 2 o’clock 
in the morning. 
The reason I bring up the story is be-
cause we must have had—you were 
there, Mr. President—we must have 
had like north of 20 votes at least. So 
we started early in the evening and 
went until 2 in the morning or there-
abouts. 
But the semifinal game between the 
North Dakota State University Bison 
and the James Madison Dukes was on 
television that Friday evening, so be-
tween votes, we were going into the 
cloakroom, and we had it on television 
there. So between votes, all the Sen-
ators—at 
least 
in 
the 
Republican 
cloakroom—we had it on, and we were 
watching the game. 
It was a lot of fun and helped, you 
know, with the long evening, but it 
really demonstrated how this program 
has done so much in terms of for the 
State and NDSU and really providing 
an awareness nationwide of these great 
student athletes we have, because all of 
our colleagues got to see them, and 
they commented on not just the caliber 
of the football that our team played— 
it was a hard-fought game. James 
Madison has a wonderful program as 
well; again, really just a class oper-
ation. So the Bison won in a hard- 
fought game. 
But the other thing that was fun—we 
have a dome. We call it the Bison 
Dome. Go figure. And remember that 
Bison is B-I-S-O-N, but it is a Z, not an 
S, when you say it properly. But they 
showed all the fans having fun and the 
noise in the dome, which makes it so 
hard to come up and play North Da-
kota State on our home field in our 
dome. Everybody, of course, is dressed 
in green and gold. But what an incred-
ible sports atmosphere. 
For anyone who likes collegiate ath-
letics, this is one of the most iconic, 
greatest venues in the country. Again, 
it is Bison Nation. It is the fans. It is 
everybody—the coaching staff, Presi-
dent Bresciani, his whole team, the 
staff and faculty, and, of course, most 
of all, the student athletes. 
I know the Presiding Officer, coming 
from Michigan, knows what great 
sports teams are all about. 
Their commitment, their hard work, 
their passion, their support of Bison 
Nation—all these things just make it a 
joyous and wonderful thing. 
I can’t say enough about these young 
people, the commitment they made 
and the hard work that they do. Many 
of them may actually end up in the 
professional ranks. So they are playing 
at an extremely high level. They are 
just wonderful young people, and I 
can’t say enough great things about 
them. 
Once again, now 9 out of the last 11 
years, national champs—again, con-
gratulations and go, Bison. 
With that, I would like to turn to my 
colleague Senator CRAMER.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S148 
January 11, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator HOEVEN. I just want to fully 
associate myself with every word of 
Senator HOEVEN and every thought you 
just heard. JOHN HOEVEN is not just a 
Senator who represents the State that 
the Bison play in; he is a fan. To say 
the least, he is a fan. 
Senator HOEVEN did a great job, as 
have ESPN and everybody else, in 
highlighting the legacy of the Bison 
Nation. There has been 9 out of 11 na-
tional championships. 
One of the things I really appreciate 
about Coach Matt Entz—who, by the 
way, was named this year again the 
FCS Coach of the Year. That is the sec-
ond FCS National Coach of the Year in 
the last 3 years. He has been the coach 
for 3 years. 
But, as he likes to point out, while it 
is, in fact, the ninth national cham-
pionship in 11 seasons for the Bison, it 
is the first one for this team—a fact 
that we sometimes forget. Excellence 
over time requires one excellent team 
after another. So I want to focus just a 
little bit not so much on the legacy but 
on this particular team. 
Remember, as Senator HOEVEN said, 
they beat the Bobcats 38 to 10. It be-
came 38 to 10 after they had been ahead 
35 to 0. That is not a minor thing in 
collegiate football. But the 38-to-10 vic-
tory tied with the fourth largest mar-
gin of victory in FCS championship 
game history. After that is NDSU’s 28- 
point victory over Towson to cap the 
2013 season. It was the fourth time 
NDSU has won the FCS championship 
by 26 or more points. 
North Dakota State’s 108 rushing 
yards in the first quarter and 160 in the 
second quarter marked the third and 
fourth times in the 2021 FCS playoffs 
that the Bison ran for 100 yards in a 
quarter. Imagine that. Twice they did 
it in the same game—103 in the first 
quarter and 116 in the second quarter of 
NDSU’s second-round win over South-
ern Illinois. 
Now, NDSU’s 28-to-0 halftime lead 
was the largest halftime margin in FCS 
championship history, passing the 24- 
to-0 Bison lead over Jacksonville State 
in 2015. In other words, this team, this 
one team, is excellent among excel-
lence. They had 378 yards rushing and 
540 yards of total offense. That was the 
most by the Bison in FCS champion-
ship game history, surpassing a 300- 
yard rushing performance against Sam 
Houston State in 2012 and 488 total 
yards against Eastern Washington in 
the 2018 season. 
We have to talk a little bit about 
fullback Hunter Luepke, who was voted 
the Most Outstanding Player of the 
championship game. He tied a career- 
high with three rushing touchdowns— 
the first three of the game, one shy of 
the FCS championship game record of 
four rushing touchdowns by Furman’s 
John Bagwell in 1985. 
This team, this one excellent team 
out of dozens of excellent teams over 
the years, and this one excellent player 
obviously stand out, along with their 
one excellent coach, as I said earlier, 
Matt Entz, the FCS National Coach of 
the Year. 
I love that Senator HOEVEN consist-
ently refers to these players as student 
athletes because, remember, before 
they are football players, they are stu-
dents, and I think it is worth noting 
what exceptional students they are. 
NDSU’s Cole Wisniewski was the win-
ner of the NCAA Elite 90 Award. The 
Elite 90 is presented to the student ath-
lete with the highest cumulative grade 
point average participating at the 
finals site for each of the NCAA’s 
championships. But he is one among 
many. 
Five 
student 
athletes 
were 
named to the football all-academic 
team. 
NDSU 
linebacker 
Jackson 
Hankey headlines this group of five 
student athletes named to the Missouri 
Valley Football Conference All-Aca-
demic Team on December 14. 
I think it is important to highlight 
and be specific about these guys. 
Hankey is a senior from Park River, 
ND. John and I know Park River. It is 
a pretty small place. He has an under-
graduate degree not in underwater bas-
ket weaving and not even in physical 
education, although there is nothing 
wrong with that, but, rather, in agri-
cultural economics. He was selected to 
the first team with a 3.636 grade point 
average. 
Here are the other four besides him: 
Hunter Luepke, the outstanding player 
of the game, has a 3.42 GPA in finance. 
Sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 
Eli 
Mostaert has a 3.733 GPA in finance. 
Kicker Jake Reinholz has a 4.00 GPA in 
the master’s degree program in me-
chanical engineering. The senior defen-
sive tackle, Lane Tucker, has a 3.857 
GPA in the MBA program. Great ath-
letes are smart athletes. Great athletes 
are smart athletes. 
All right. To continue that, this is a 
tribute. Well, while they take the stage 
on ESPN and on game day and the var-
ious programs, it is important to point 
out that North Dakota State Univer-
sity’s athletic teams achieved a re-
markable—remarkable—semester 
last 
fall with a 3.418 grade point average 
among all 427 student athletes. Three 
Bison teams earned the highest ever 
GPA. The statistics are incredible. 
They are incredible in terms of aca-
demic 
achievements 
of 
these 
out-
standing athletes throughout all of the 
sports at North Dakota State Univer-
sity, not just football. But they defi-
nitely lead the charts. 
So, to wrap up, in talking again a lit-
tle bit about the dynasty, one of my fa-
vorite quotes—and I refer to it a lot; I 
use it a lot when I talk about Bison 
football—is Aristotle, who said: 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, 
[therefore], is not an act, but a habit. 
It is not an act. It is a habit. 
There are 9 out of 11 national cham-
pionships in the FCS alone. Before 
that, as Division II, they won several 
national championships. They never 
lost a national championship. In other 
words, they repeatedly win national 
championships. That makes winning 
habitual. It is habitual. 
They made their ninth appearance, 
as I said, in the championship game— 
the most of any FCS team. They won 
them all, as we know. They now have 
17 football national championships in 
history. They won their last 13 title 
game appearances. I mean, it is kind of 
remarkable. They improved to 41 and 
3—imagine this, Senator HOEVEN—41 
and 3 in FCS playoffs since 2010. 
We are what we repeatedly do. Excel-
lence, then, is not an act but a habit. 
I, as well, salute Dean Bresciani, the 
president; Matt Entz, the head coach; 
the entire coaching staff; the entire 
faculty; every student athlete; and 
every parent who got these student 
athletes to college. 
It is just a remarkable thing to be 
able to represent this level of excel-
lence, and I join Senator HOEVEN in 
saying: ‘‘Horns up! Go Bison! Go 
Bison!’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator CRAMER for his comments and 
wonderful commentary on these great 
student athletes, but there is one other 
point I want to make that goes to the 
excellence of this program. 
In the last national championship 
they won, the quarterback was a won-
derful player by the name of Trey 
Lance. He played for 1 year as a red-
shirt freshman. So he easily could have 
been playing this year, which would 
have been probably his sophomore or, 
maybe, junior year. It is a little hard 
to say with the COVID spring season, 
but I think it would have been his 
sophomore year. 
The reason he wasn’t able to quarter-
back the team is that he was quarter-
backing the San Francisco 49ers to a 
win in the NFL. So they bring in an-
other redshirt freshman quarterback 
who platoons with some other players, 
who is another wonderful quarterback, 
Cam Miller. So they win it with an-
other player. 
Again, it just shows, even as they 
lose some of these players—sometimes 
in the transfer portal and sometimes to 
the NFL, as Senator CRAMER said— 
they keep bringing in just excellent 
athletes, and he mentioned a number of 
them. It is not just that they are excel-
lent athletes; they are student ath-
letes. Again, that goes to the quality 
and the character of the program. 
So we commend all of them—Senator 
CRAMER, thanks for joining me—and 
also with KELLY
ARMSTRONG
in the 
House in recognizing a wonderful group 
that truly deserves it—all the Bison 
nation. 
Anything else from Senator CRAMER? 
All right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to congratulate the North Dakota

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S149 
January 11, 2022 
Senators, my colleagues, on the great 
job with their football team. 
‘‘Go Bison!’’ 
Well done, North Dakota. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. President, I wanted to come 
down here, like many of my colleagues 
today, and talk about a really impor-
tant topic, and that is the future of the 
filibuster and the issue of voting 
rights, both of which are very impor-
tant to this country. We are going to 
be focused a lot—perhaps with some 
major votes, historic votes, in the U.S. 
Senate this week—on these topics. 
There has been a lot of talk recently 
from my Democratic colleagues about 
actually getting rid of the filibuster. 
This, as many of my colleagues have 
mentioned, would be an action that 
would fundamentally transform this 
institution and this country. 
The irony is that, until very re-
cently, the vast majority of our col-
leagues here—Republicans and Demo-
crats—were in agreement on this topic, 
in essence, of getting rid of the fili-
buster, which has been part of the U.S. 
Senate for decades—for centuries, in 
many aspects, if you look at our his-
tory. It would not be a wise move for 
the Senate. It would not be a wise 
move for America. This has been a 
longstanding bipartisan view. 
Let me just give you a couple of 
quotes from some of my colleagues. 
My colleague from Montana, Senator 
TESTER, just said last year: 
I am a ‘‘no’’ on changing the filibuster. I 
am a ‘‘no.’’ The move to make the Senate 
like the House, I think, is a mistake. 
My colleague from Delaware, Senator 
COONS, said in 2018: 
I am committed to never voting to change 
the legislative filibuster. 
That is what Senator COONS said. 
My colleague from Illinois, Senator 
DURBIN, in 2018, also said: 
I can tell you getting rid of the filibuster 
would be the end of the Senate as it was 
originally devised and created going back to 
our Founding Fathers. We have to acknowl-
edge respect for the minority, and that is 
what the Senate tries to do in its composi-
tion and its procedure. 
Wise words from Senator DURBIN. 
Of course, there is a trove of quotes 
from the majority leader, Senator 
SCHUMER, who vehemently opposed get-
ting rid of the filibuster in the past 
when he was in the minority. Let me 
highlight just a few of them. 
Here is one he said in 2005: 
Bottom line is very simple. The ideologues 
in the Senate want to turn what the Found-
ing Fathers called the ‘‘cooling saucer of de-
mocracy’’ into the rubberstamp of dictator-
ship. We will not let them. They want to 
make this country into a banana republic. 
Never one for subtlety, that is our 
majority leader right now. 
Then he went on to say: 
It would be doomsday for democracy. 
Again, not too subtle there, the ma-
jority leader. 
It would be doomsday for democracy if we 
get rid of the filibuster. 
Here is another Senator who is very 
famous around the world and who be-
came President, Barack Obama. 
He said with regard to getting rid of 
the filibuster in 2005: 
What they do not expect is for one party, 
be it Republican or Democrat, to change the 
rules in the middle of the game so that they 
can make all the decisions while the other 
party is told to sit down and keep quiet. 
Since we are reaching back, let me 
quote the late Senator Robert Byrd of 
West Virginia on this issue. 
Here he is in 2005: 
The filibuster must go, they say. In my 53 
years in Congress, I have never seen a matter 
that came before the Congress, before the 
Senate, or the House, as a matter of fact, 
that is so dangerous, so out of the main-
stream, and so radical as this one. I pray 
that Senators will pause and reflect before 
ignoring that history and tradition in favor 
of the political priority of the moment. 
That was Senator Byrd. 
Of course, it is not just Senators. 
Here is what the organ of the Demo-
cratic Party, also known as the New 
York Times editorial board, said in 2004 
about the filibuster: 
Republicans see the filibuster as an annoy-
ing obstacle, but it is actually one of the 
checks and balances that the Founders, who 
worried greatly about the concentration of 
power, built into our system. 
So this has been a view that has been 
widely held: Don’t get rid of the fili-
buster. 
Senator MANCHIN, in an op-ed re-
cently, talking about how he would 
not, under no circumstances, vote to 
eliminate or weaken the filibuster, 
gave a really important reason why, 
which, as Alaska’s Senator, I feel very 
strongly about. He noted in that piece 
that the current rules with regard to 
the filibuster and the 60-vote threshold 
guarantee that ‘‘rural and small States 
and the Americans who live in them al-
ways have a seat at the table in the 
U.S. Senate.’’ 
Well, I think that that is enormously 
important. It is enormously important 
for Alaska, but it is enormously impor-
tant for the Senate as a body, which 
was how we were designed by the 
Founding Fathers. 
Now, you know, there are charges of 
hypocrisy that can be leveled at this 
institution and at the Members in it. 
Many times, there are examples of 
when Members of Congress say one 
thing when they are in power and have 
authority and they say another thing 
when they are out of power. But I will 
tell you, on this issue, that has not 
been the case for the Republican Sen-
ators here. 
What do I mean? 
In 2017, 61 U.S. Senators, in this let-
ter, wrote the majority leader, then 
Senator MCCONNELL, and the minority 
leader, Senator SCHUMER—33 Repub-
licans and 30 Democrats—saying, in es-
sence, don’t get rid of the filibuster. 
These were 30 Democrats, 4 years ago, 
who wrote this letter, saying don’t get 
rid of the filibuster. 
Now, that is when the Republicans 
were in the majority, and there was a 
Republican in the White House. There 
was pressure, I will tell you, on Repub-
licans like there is now on Democrats, 
from certain elements in the White 
House and other places, to get rid of 
the filibuster, and we didn’t do it. We 
did not do it for all of the reasons that 
we have been discussing. 
Yet I guess we are going to see a vote 
in the first time in history, I believe, in 
the U.S. Senate where the majority 
leader of the U.S. Senate is going to ac-
tually move forward to start getting 
rid of the filibuster. I am pretty sure 
that has never happened—the legisla-
tive filibuster—in the history of the 
United States of America. It is a big 
deal. 
So, look, my Democratic colleagues 
are clearly cognizant of how vulnerable 
they look with regard to being hypo-
critical on the issue. As I mentioned, 31 
of them, just 4 years ago, signed a let-
ter, saying don’t get rid of it when Re-
publicans had power in the Senate and 
in the White House, and we didn’t. But 
now, they are like, Hmm, we are going 
to flip-flop and say we should get rid of 
it. 
The Presiding Officer may have seen 
that there are already these filibuster 
flip-flop cards. I won’t name the Sen-
ators, but it shows them wearing flip- 
flops. The President is there, but it is 
already out there, right? This is a big, 
big flip-flop, not on some small issue 
but on one of the most fundamental 
issues in the U.S. Senate, and my col-
leagues know this. 
So what is their response? What is 
their response? 
In looking at their previous state-
ments, like the Senate majority lead-
er’s, who has made a lot of state-
ments—I have just read a few—in say-
ing, you know, that it doesn’t really 
matter, and I didn’t really mean it, 
what is the argument? Well, here is the 
argument. Here is their argument. The 
Senate filibuster must be nuked be-
cause American democracy must be 
saved from Republican State legisla-
tors and Republican Members of Con-
gress and their so-called Jim Crow 2.0 
schemes. This is their new language. 
Everybody from the President to Ma-
jority Leader SCHUMER is using this 
talking point. 
Just yesterday and today, the major-
ity leader was going on about Repub-
lican Jim Crow 2.0 schemes and the 
need for Democrats to protect and de-
fend American democracy, and Joe 
Biden—that unifier, that great uni-
fier—uses the Jim Crow 2.0 charge 
against Republicans on a very regular 
basis. As a matter of fact, he just did it 
a few hours ago, again, down in Geor-
gia today. 
It is all historically inaccurate, and 
it is insulting to millions of Ameri-
cans. Of course, they are stated with a 
smug, moral superiority, their argu-
ments that voting rights laws—just lis-
ten to them, listen to them—in Demo-
crat States are good and noble and are 
protecting American democracy while 
voting rights laws in Republican States 
are bad and even racist. Jim Crow 2.0 is 
their argument. Listen to the Presi-
dent. Listen to the majority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S150 
January 11, 2022 
They were making those arguments as 
recently as today. That is their argu-
ment as to why, after all of these years 
of saying don’t get rid of the filibuster, 
they are saying now we have to get rid 
of the filibuster. 
So here is the key question: Are 
these arguments accurate? Are their 
claims actually true? 
Now, I do not assume to know the de-
tails of other States’ voting laws, and 
here is the truth. You have had a lot of 
U.S. Senators in the last couple of 
weeks and couple of months—heck, 
even today—coming down to the Sen-
ate floor, claiming they know all about 
these other laws in other States on 
voting rights. They don’t. Trust me. 
For those watching, they don’t. 
I don’t claim to know the details of 
voting rights laws in other States. But 
here is what I do know. I know a lot 
about Alaska’s laws, a lot about Alas-
ka’s voting laws. In fact, when I was 
attorney general, I was in the trenches, 
defending the right to vote for all Alas-
kans. I am proud to have that as part 
of my record. 
I know a lot about Alaska’s voting 
rights laws—a Republican State—and 
here are some very important and rath-
er inconvenient truths and facts about 
my State’s laws in three critical areas 
of voting rights: early in-person voting, 
automatic voter registration, and no- 
excuse absentee voting. 
My Republican State, the great State 
of Alaska, has voting laws that are sig-
nificantly more expansive than the 
laws of New York, than the laws of 
Delaware, 
than 
the 
laws 
of 
Con-
necticut, than the laws of Massachu-
setts and the laws of New Hampshire, 
just to name a few. That is a fact. 
President 
Biden’s 
speech 
today 
talked about facts. Well, these are 
facts. And I am going to talk a little 
bit more about these facts, but here is 
my point: Those States I just named— 
New York, Delaware, Connecticut, and 
Massachusetts—are those States Jim 
Crow 2.0 relative to Alaska? Well, by 
Joe Biden’s reasoning, they are. 
So I want to go a little bit more in 
detail on some of these issues I am 
talking about. These are important 
areas with regard to voting rights. 
Let’s start with early in-person vot-
ing: Alaska, 15 days; other States, less 
so; New Jersey, DC, 10 days, 7 days; 
New York, 10 days; Massachusetts, 11 
days. They haven’t met my State yet. 
That is OK. 
Now look at Connecticut—no days. 
There is no early in-person voting at 
all. In New Hampshire, there is no 
early in-person voting at all. Why don’t 
these States want people to vote early? 
Is it Jim Crow 2.0? Look, I wouldn’t 
make that claim against those States, 
maligning their elected officials. I am 
sure they have their reasons. But, 
again, by President Biden’s logic, they 
are. 
Let me do another area of important 
voting rights laws: voter registration. 
My State in essence has automatic 
voter registration—probably one of the 
most forward-leaning of any State in 
the country. As I speak right here on 
the Senate floor, there is no automatic 
voter registration in Pennsylvania, in 
Minnesota, in Arizona, in New Hamp-
shire, in Delaware—President Biden’s 
State—or in Wisconsin. None. None. 
None of these States have automatic 
voter registration. Are these States 
Jim Crow 2.0 relative to Alaska, my 
Republican State? I wouldn’t say that, 
but, again, by President Biden’s logic, 
they are. 
Let me give you one more, a pretty 
important one as well. This is the issue 
of no-excuse absentee voting. There are 
many other expansive provisions in 
Alaska’s laws as it pertains to voting, 
but here is one that we think is impor-
tant. If for some reason you can’t make 
it down to the polling location and you 
want to vote absentee, you can. You 
don’t need an excuse to vote absentee. 
We have been doing that for years and 
years and years. 
Let’s look at other States. In Dela-
ware, you have to have an excuse. In 
New Hampshire, you have to have an 
excuse. 
Connecticut. 
Massachusetts. 
New York. By the way, all of the Sen-
ators from these States are down here. 
Jim Crow 2.0. Republican States. What 
about this issue? This is a really im-
portant issue. Are these States Jim 
Crow 2.0 relative to my State? Well, ac-
cording to Joe Biden’s logic, they are. 
I wouldn’t make that claim. 
Let me focus on New York, Con-
necticut, and Massachusetts for a little 
bit longer, on their laws—because I did 
look into this—and actually what does 
not constitute an excuse. 
Again, in my State, there is no ex-
cuse. If you want to vote absentee, you 
can. In these States, you have to have 
an excuse. But here is the deal. In New 
York or Connecticut or Massachusetts, 
age is not an excuse. It is not an ex-
cuse. You can be 90 years old, 95 years 
old; fought in World War II; maybe it is 
hard for you to get to the polling 
place—nope, not in New York, not in 
Connecticut, not in Massachusetts. 
That is no excuse. Sorry, World War II 
veteran who can barely walk. 
Let me give you another example of 
those States—actually, the States of 
New 
York, 
Delaware, 
Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. If 
you are a victim of stalking or domes-
tic violence—you don’t want to leave 
your home and go to a public polling 
place; you don’t want your address on a 
public document—is that an excuse so 
you can get an absentee ballot? Nope. 
Nope. You must leave your home and 
go down to the polling place. That is 
not an excuse, domestic violence vic-
tim. 
Let me remind the listeners. New 
York doesn’t allow that as an excuse. 
The majority leader is from New York. 
Delaware doesn’t allow that as an ex-
cuse. The President of the United 
States is from Delaware. 
(Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.) 
To me, these election laws seem par-
ticularly egregious, as egregious as any 
of the examples offered by the other 
side about voting restrictions in other 
States that we have been hearing 
about, ones that are now shamelessly 
and ridiculously compared to Jim Crow 
2.0 by our own President, the unifier. 
But here is the thing: I wouldn’t tell 
New York that it must change its vot-
ing laws. I don’t understand the people 
who live in New York who don’t want 
to give a World War II veteran an ex-
cuse to vote absentee. 
For that matter, New York actually 
doesn’t want to change their own vot-
ing laws to be more expansive of voting 
rights like we are in Alaska. How do I 
know this? New York just had a state-
wide referendum to have same-day 
voter registration and no-excuse absen-
tee voting like my State. Guess what. 
The people of New York voted against 
that. The people of New York had an 
opportunity to meet the level where we 
are in Alaska, a Republican State, and 
the people of New York rejected it. 
I don’t know what is going on in New 
York, why the good people there re-
jected these provisions, but it is going 
to be interesting. We will see if Leader 
SCHUMER is consistent and accuses his 
own constituents of supporting Jim 
Crow 2.0 as he has millions of his fellow 
Americans. Is he going to do that? 
They just rejected what my State al-
ready has: no-excuse absentee voting. 
New York rejected it. Are the New 
Yorkers Jim Crow 2.0 relative to Alas-
ka? I don’t think so. There are reasons 
in their State, I am sure, that they 
would make for not doing what we do 
in Alaska. But, again, by President 
Biden’s own logic, they are. I am con-
fident the good people of New York 
have a reason. 
But here is the thing, and it is a seri-
ous issue: The Jim Crow era, we know, 
was a horrible blight and stain on our 
country. Some of the most heinous 
laws were passed to prevent African 
Americans from voting. It was a hor-
rible era. But it is remarkable how cas-
ually the President of the United 
States and the majority leader now 
throw out their Jim Crow 2.0 insult at 
Republicans, at Republican States. The 
President and the majority leader do 
this when their States don’t even close-
ly measure up to mine on critical vot-
ing rights issues and laws. It is pretty 
remarkable, pretty hypocritical. 
But it is not just me making this ar-
gument. Here is an article from The 
Atlantic that came out recently enti-
tled ‘‘The Blue States That Make It 
Hardest To Vote.’’ Here is the subtitle: 
‘‘Democrats are criticizing Republicans 
for pushing restrictive voting laws. But 
states such as Joe Biden’s Delaware 
can make casting a ballot difficult.’’ 
I would I ask unanimous consent to 
have this printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

S151 
January 11, 2022 
[From The Atlantic, April 15, 2021] 
THE BLUE STATES THAT MAKE IT HARDEST TO 
VOTE 
(By Russell Berman) 
DEMOCRATS ARE CRITICIZING REPUBLICANS FOR 
PUSHING
RESTRICTIVE
VOTING
LAWS. BUT 
STATES SUCH AS JOE BIDEN’S DELAWARE CAN 
MAKE CASTING A BALLOT DIFFICULT. 
If President Joe Biden wants to vote by 
mail next year in Delaware, he’ll have to 
provide a valid reason for why he can’t make 
the two-hour drive from the White House 
back to his polling place in Wilmington. 
Luckily for him, Biden’s line of work allows 
him to cast an absentee ballot: Being presi-
dent counts as ‘‘public service’’ under state 
law. Most Delaware residents, however, 
won’t have such a convenient excuse. Few 
states have more limited voting options than 
Delaware, a Democratic bastion that allowed 
little mail balloting before the pandemic hit. 
Biden has assailed Georgia’s new voting 
law as an atrocity akin to ‘‘Jim Crow in the 
21st century for the impact it could have on 
Black citizens. But even once the GOP- 
passed measure takes effect, Georgia citizens 
will still have far more opportunities to vote 
before Election Day than their counterparts 
in the president’s home state, where one in 
three residents is Black or Latino. To Repub-
licans, Biden’s criticism of the Georgia law 
smacks of hypocrisy. ‘‘They have a point,’’ 
says Dwayne Bensing, a voting-rights advo-
cate with Delaware’s ACLU affiliate. ‘‘The 
state is playing catch-up in a lot of ways.’’ 
Delaware isn’t an anomaly among Demo-
cratic strongholds, and its example presents 
the president’s party with an uncomfortable 
reminder: Although Democrats like to call 
out Republicans for trying to suppress vot-
ing, the states they control in the Northeast 
make casting a ballot more difficult than 
anywhere else. 
Connecticut has no early voting at all, and 
New York’s onerous rules force voters to 
change their registration months in advance 
if they want to participate in a party pri-
mary. In Rhode Island, Democrats enacted a 
decade ago the kind of photo-ID law that the 
party has labeled ‘‘racist’’ when drafted by 
Republicans; the state also requires voters to 
get the signatures of not one but two wit-
nesses when casting an absentee ballot (only 
Alabama and North Carolina are similarly 
strict). According to a new analysis released 
this week by the nonpartisan Center for 
Election Innovation and Research, Delaware, 
Connecticut, and New York rank in the bot-
tom third of states in their access to early 
and mail-in balloting. 
The restrictions across the Northeast are 
relics of the urban Democratic machines, 
which preferred to mobilize their voters pre-
cinct by precinct on Election Day rather 
than give reformers a lengthier window to 
rally opposition. Democrats who have won 
election after election in states such as New 
York, Delaware, Connecticut, and Rhode Is-
land have had little incentive to change the 
rules that helped them win. 
The party has been more concerned with 
expanding access to the polls in places where 
it has struggled to obtain and keep power 
(although it’s not clear whether Democrats’ 
assumptions about the impact voting laws 
have on turnout are correct). In Congress, 
Democrats are prioritizing legislation called 
the For the People Act, or H.R. 1, which 
seeks to curb GOP efforts to suppress voting. 
The bill would set national standards to 
loosen photo-ID requirements, guarantee 
early-voting and voting-by-mail options, and 
mandate automatic and same-day registra-
tion. Although Democrats have focused on 
how the bill would rein in red states, H.R. 1 
would hit some blue states just as hard, if 
not harder. 
Republicans love to call out Democratic 
sanctimony in the debate over voting laws, 
but this ignores the divergent directions the 
two parties are headed. Following their 2020 
defeat and under pressure from Donald 
Trump allies, Republicans are pushing to re-
strict voting in states such as Texas, Iowa, 
Arizona, and Florida, which have recently 
been competitive. The Georgia law tightens 
ID requirements for absentee ballots and 
caps the number of drop boxes where they 
can be deposited. The measure also limits 
who can distribute water to voters waiting 
in line outside polling places. The effect of 
the bill is likely to make voting easier in Re-
publican strongholds—by expanding early 
voting in rural areas, for example—but hard-
er in Democratic urban centers, where lines 
at polling places tend to be longer and where 
voting by mail was more popular last year. 
Democrats in charge of blue states are now 
racing to expand access in a way that 
matches the party’s rhetoric nationwide. In 
some cases, they’re trying to make perma-
nent the temporary changes to voting laws 
that were put in place because of the pan-
demic. Delaware, for example, removed the 
mandate that voters cite a reason for casting 
an absentee ballot. Making the reform per-
manent requires the passage of an amend-
ment to the state constitution, and Repub-
licans who supported that proposal in the 
past are balking now, threatening its adop-
tion. 
The limit on mail-in ballots isn’t Dela-
ware’s only voting anachronism. Bensing 
told me that he’s been voting early in elec-
tions since he first cast a ballot, in Arkansas 
in 2002. When he moved to Delaware two 
years ago, he was shocked to find that the 
option wasn’t available. Delaware won’t 
debut early voting until 2022, and the 10-day 
period the state plans to offer still falls short 
of the 15-day minimum congressional Demo-
crats have proposed in their voting-rights 
legislation. 
Democrats in Delaware may finally be 
opening up their voting laws, but they’re un-
willing to call them racist. State Represent-
ative David Bentz has been trying to expand 
voting since he arrived in the legislature in 
2015 and is leading the Democrats’ push to 
modernize the state’s laws now. But when I 
asked him why it’s taken so long for Dela-
ware to change its rules, he was stumped. ‘‘I 
wish I had a better answer for you,’’ Bentz 
told me. He said the state did not have a his-
tory of long lines at the polls. ‘‘It wasn’t 
something where groups were coming up to 
me and saying, ‘Hey, we’re disenfranchising 
people,’ ’’ Bentz said. If anything, Democrats 
suggest, the state’s restrictive voting laws 
are born of political inertia. When Bentz and 
Bensing joined a multiracial group of advo-
cates over Zoom last week to announce a co-
ordinated push for new voting laws, accord-
ing to Bensing, it was the first-ever state-
wide coalition dedicated to voting rights in 
Delaware. 
Unlike Delaware’s restrictions, Rhode Is-
land’s voter-ID law can’t be described as an-
tiquated: The statute is just 10 years old and 
won adoption under a Democratic majority 
with support from powerful Black elected 
leaders. Voting-rights advocates trace the 
law’s passage to the conservative bent of the 
state’s Democratic Party and tension that 
pitted Black and white Democrats against 
the state’s rising Latino population. Backers 
of the bill included the first Black speaker of 
the General Assembly. They shared stories of 
voter fraud they had witnessed, but oppo-
nents of the law saw it as an effort to sup-
press Latino turnout in Providence. ‘‘It was 
bizarro,’’ said John Marion, the executive di-
rector of Common Cause Rhode Island, the 
state affiliate of the national government- 
watchdog group. ‘‘Ten years later, I still 
don’t know how it happened.’’ 
Rhode Island Democrats have proposed leg-
islation to expand voting by mail and early 
voting, including a repeal of the requirement 
that absentee ballots have two witness sig-
natures. But they’re not likely to touch the 
voter-ID system. ‘‘Repealing voter ID was a 
nonstarter,’’ Steven Brown, the executive di-
rector of the ACLU of Rhode Island, told me. 
‘‘So there was no point in putting it in the 
reform bill.’’ Rhode Island’s critics of the ID 
requirement now find themselves in the 
same unenviable position as their progres-
sive allies in red states: hoping the federal 
government will override a restrictive law 
that their own leaders—in this case, fellow 
Democrats—refuse to change. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Here is a little bit of 
what this article says: 
[President Biden] has assailed Georgia’s 
new voting laws as an atrocity akin to ‘‘Jim 
Crow in the 21st century. . . . But even once 
the GOP-passed measure [in Georgia] takes 
effect, Georgia citizens will still have far 
more opportunities to vote before Election 
Day than their counterparts in the presi-
dent’s home state. 
That is The Atlantic—not known as a 
Republican magazine or anything. 
The Atlantic article goes on to say: 
Delaware isn’t an anomaly among Demo-
cratic strongholds, and its example presents 
the president’s party with an uncomfortable 
reminder: Although Democrats like to call 
out Republicans for trying to suppress vot-
ing, the states [the Democrats] control in 
the Northeast makes casting a ballot more 
difficult than anywhere else. 
Than anywhere else. 
Here is the point I am making. I am 
not trying to say that every other 
State should be like Alaska, that we 
need to federalize elections so every 
State has the same voting rights 
issues. I am proud of where my State 
is, and I am certainly not going to let 
any smug argument on the other side 
somehow accuse my Republican State 
of Jim Crow 2.0. Meet the standards in 
my State before you make those argu-
ments. 
But the point is, we are not all going 
to be the same. I have a State that is 
one-fifth the size of the lower 48. We 
have very unique voting issues. And 
the Founding Fathers strongly believed 
that election laws, for that reason, 
should be crafted State by State. 
This is in the Constitution: 
The Times, Places and Manner of holding 
Elections for Senators and Representatives, 
shall be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof; but the Congress may at 
any time by Law make or alter such Regula-
tions. 
Yes, this Congress may make laws 
and regulations, but a wholesale Fed-
eral takeover of every State’s elections 
law is not what the Constitution con-
templated, and it is not what would be 
good for each citizen of each State in 
our country. 
My invitation to the President and 
other Members who are fundamentally 
demanding 
that 
we 
fundamentally 
alter this body by getting rid of the fil-
ibuster: Save your smug Jim Crow 2.0 
insults. Go back to your own States. 
Undertake voter rights legislation is as 
expansive as my State. Take care of 
your own States first before you come 
here and tell us that you need to fun-
damentally reorder this body and this

country by getting rid of the fili-
buster—an issue that almost everybody 
agreed on just a few years ago was not 
a good idea for the Senate or for Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, be-
fore I ran for the Senate, I ran a busi-
ness that started in my hometown. Of-
tentimes you get criticized when you 
try to draw a parallel between a busi-
ness and this place. And I guess it is so 
different, so it would be easy to make 
that argument. 
But in the real world, if you have got 
a bad idea, you can’t just change the 
rules. You have got to outcompete. 
You have got to offer another product. 
Only here, with the results that we 
have produced over time, would you 
want it even easier to generate bad 
ideas and put them into law. 
The comparison between State gov-
ernment and here, I think, is valid. In 
almost all State governments, there is 
a constitutional amendment or a stat-
ute that says you can’t spend more 
than you take in. There are certain 
guidelines, whenever you try to put 
any legislation forward, that you run it 
through regular order. We don’t do 
that anymore. That takes too much 
time. That takes too much effort. 
And when you try to get rid of the 
things that work in other places and 
double down on bad performance, that 
is what my Democratic colleagues are 
trying to do. The radical Build Back 
Better agenda failed. And now, instead 
of changing their agenda, running it 
through committees, making it more 
palatable to get at least one Repub-
lican vote, they want to change the 
rules. 
Changing the rules of the Senate to 
enact their failed agenda is just the be-
ginning. They want to completely take 
over our elections. Senator SULLIVAN 
just said a moment ago, in the Con-
stitution, it couldn’t be more explicit 
that that is the domain of the States. 
Their plan is to silence those who 
stand in their way to campaign to fun-
damentally change in this country 
election law, and I don’t think the 
country is going to have it. Thank-
fully, my Democratic colleagues can’t 
even get all of their own Members on 
board. I think that was the same prob-
lem with the Build Back Better agen-
da. This is just going for something 
even more extreme, more impactful. It 
would have a ripple effect for who 
knows how much and how long down 
the road. 
Hoosiers should not have their voice 
in DC watered down by power-hungry 
politicians who will do anything to get 
their way. The For the People Act 
should be called the ‘‘For the Politi-
cians Act.’’ It would be a better name 
because that is what we are enabling 
here. States like Indiana, States like 
Alaska conduct their elections fairly. 
And by the way, where were any com-
plaints pre-COVID? You didn’t hear of 
any. You change the rules; then you 
want to homogenize it across the coun-
try. That doesn’t make sense. 
Election 
integrity 
measures 
like 
voter ID are extremely popular—with a 
photo ID. Every State likes that. That 
polls in close to the 80-percent range, 
which is unheard of around here. 
Americans are fed up with the top- 
down approach, one size fits all. It 
would be different if we were knocking 
it out of the park to begin with. We 
certainly aren’t. We ought to work on 
the issues we can agree on and the 
beautiful system that was built. When 
you can’t, don’t feel that the only way 
it can get done is by doing it here. 
Turn it back to the laboratory of the 
States. 
Another thing that irks me: 3 years 
ago, $18 trillion in debt, approaching 
the record level, which we have now 
eclipsed, post-World War II. The dif-
ference then and now is we were savers 
and investors then. We are consumers 
and spenders now. And this will open 
the floodgates for even more heavy 
burden on our kids and grandkids. 
We shouldn’t be changing the rules to 
make it easier to legislate or spend 
money when we produce the results 
that have been produced here now for 
decades. We cannot allow President 
Biden and the Democrats to change the 
rules and take over our elections to 
save their radical, failed agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
we are in the same spot in the Senate 
we have been at five times before in the 
past 12 months. My Senate colleagues 
are bringing up a bill on voting to fed-
eralize our elections. 
This time is different. This time 
their demands have changed. It is not 
just, ‘‘Vote for my bill or take a vote.’’ 
It is, ‘‘If you don’t do this, we will blow 
up the Senate permanently.’’ Oh, that 
is a different thing. So let me set some 
context on this because this requires 
some conversation about where we are, 
what this conversation is all about, 
and what this really means for the fu-
ture. 
So first let me begin with the bill 
itself. There is no question 100 Sen-
ators here have all been through an 
election process. We are all experts on 
elections. We have walked through it 
in a way that most Americans have 
never walked through before. We are 
passionate about fair elections. We are 
passionate about the people who actu-
ally vote because those are the people 
who are actually engaged in our soci-
ety. As we have millions of people who 
check out, don’t care, and don’t vote, 
we encourage people to vote, to pay at-
tention. 
The laws in our States are a little bit 
different on voting because each State 
is a little bit different. That is not 
something new. That is actually writ-
ten into the U.S. Constitution. It has 
been that way since 1789. They have al-
ways been a little bit different. 
In 1965, our Nation took a strong, 
bold step to be able to make sure that 
we protected the rights of every single 
individual to be able to vote because 
there was a season in American history 
where Black Americans were being 
pushed out. There were poll taxes. 
There were Jim Crow laws. There were 
things that actually pushed people 
away from voting. 
So, in 1965, our Nation passed the 
Voting Rights Act. I will talk a little 
bit more about that in a moment. That 
Voting Rights Act still stands today to 
be able to protect the right of every in-
dividual in America to vote. If a single 
person or group of people are sup-
pressed in their voting, are prohibited 
from voting, Federal courts today have 
the right to be able to step in on any 
jurisdiction, any State in America, to 
be able to protect the rights of individ-
uals to be able to vote. 
I bring that to this body as a re-
minder because, for some reason, an 
enormous portion of this body on the 
left side of this room is running around 
the Nation and saying, ‘‘If we don’t do 
something right now, there will be 
voter suppression in America, and we 
have to change that,’’ when they all 
know, in 1965, we passed the Voting 
Rights Act, and that act still stands 
today to be able to protect the rights 
of individuals. 
I hear people wander around the Na-
tion and get on news channels and say 
the Voting Rights Act has been kicked 
out by the Supreme Court, when they 
know that is a lie. They know it is. One 
section of the Voting Rights Act the 
Supreme Court took out several years 
ago. It was the section that required 
what is called preclearance. It created 
a formula for States that had done a 
lot of oppression against Black Ameri-
cans. It created a certain formula for 
them. If they made any changes in 
their voting laws, they had to get 
preclearance for that. 
It stayed in place for decades. Even 
though their State had cleaned up 
their voting laws and had changed, for 
decades it stayed there, until the Su-
preme Court looked at it and said: You 
can’t hold this over these States a gen-
eration later for something that a pre-
vious generation did. 
And so the Supreme Court kicked 
that one section out but kept every-
thing else, including protecting the 
rights of every single American from 
voter suppression. Every law in every 
State in America could be challenged 
in a Federal district court, circuit 
court, and to the Supreme Court to 
make sure the rights of individuals are 
protected. 
Now, people here may not know that 
that still exists based on the way that 
the news has talked about voting of 
late and based on all the conversation 
about voting, but that is the law of the 
land right now. 
So what is being brought to this body 
to vote on then? Well, here is what has 
been brought to this body to be able to 
vote on: a long list of things that they

want to be able to address and to be 
able to say they want to change voting 
in America to be able to remake it in 
their image, except it is not in the 
image of their States because many of 
my Democratic colleagues don’t actu-
ally have, in their own State, the 
things that they are actually putting 
into this Federal legislation; meaning, 
literally, they are taking over from of-
ficials in their own State, telling their 
own Governor, their own legislature 
that they are wrong and that they are 
going to set them straight. 
We have a disagreement on some of 
these issues. I will grant you that. 
Some of these areas in the bill we go: 
Let’s talk about it. Most of the areas 
in their bill we look at and go: Are you 
kidding me? We just disagree on this— 
things like same-day voter registra-
tion, where a person could literally 
walk in and say, ‘‘I never registered to 
vote before,’’ tell them their name, and 
then vote on the spot. Honestly, I have 
a problem with that because there is no 
way to be able to validate they didn’t 
vote in Oklahoma City, then vote in 
Tulsa, then vote in Muskogee, OK. 
There is no way to know. They just 
voted, and they did same-day registra-
tion, so there is no way to verify that 
person is actually that person. 
Interestingly enough, they also in-
clude in their bill undermining State 
voter ID laws, so the combination of 
the two is pretty powerful. You can’t 
call for ID, but you can register on the 
spot. That is a formula for fraud. 
It is not just my opinion; it is the 
State of New York’s opinion. The State 
of New York does not have same-day 
voter registration. In fact, this last No-
vember, it was on the ballot in the 
State of New York, and the people of 
the State of New York overwhelmingly 
said that is a terrible idea and voted it 
down. Yet Senator SCHUMER
stands 
right over there and tells every State, 
including his that just voted this down: 
No, you have to do this. We are going 
to require it because some people in 
this body think it should be required. 
We have a disagreement on that. 
That is a real disagreement we should 
be able to debate and talk about. In-
stead, my Democratic colleagues are 
saying: If you disagree with me on this, 
I will blow up the rules of the Senate, 
and we will get what I want no matter 
what. 
Can we not have a disagreement that 
same-day voter registration may be a 
bad idea, when even the State of New 
York and the people of New York think 
it is a bad idea? 
They have a mandate for using ballot 
drop boxes. I don’t have a problem with 
ballot drop boxes, but their ballot drop 
box issue is you can’t provide security. 
If you have any kind of security set-
ting for it or any kind of chain-of-cus-
tody requirement, then that is going to 
be oppressive and suppressive. 
You know, I think it is a good idea, 
when dealing with a ballot, that you 
actually know where it went and if 
anyone changed it; if people dropped 
off multiple ballots, when it is only 
legal to drop off one. I think it may be 
important to know if you are going to 
verify an election. We have a disagree-
ment on that. 
We have a disagreement on the issue 
of felons voting. Now, each State 
makes that decision whether they are 
going to allow felons to vote, but in 
this piece of legislation Democrats are 
bringing, they are saying: No, felons 
have to be given the right to vote when 
they get out of prison. 
Now, I understand we may disagree 
on that, but I want you to understand 
what they are saying. My Democratic 
colleagues are saying: I will blow up 
the rules of the Senate and change 250 
years of history in the Senate to get 
my way if you don’t allow rapists, con-
victed murderers, and convicted sex of-
fenders to be able to vote. They are so 
determined that sex offenders get the 
right to vote, they are willing to blow 
up the rules of the Senate to get it. 
Can we not have a disagreement on if 
we are going to force States to man-
date that convicted murders, sex of-
fenders, and rapists get to vote again? 
In this piece of legislation, they pro-
vide 
government 
funding, 
taxpayer 
funding, for Members of the House of 
Representatives just down the hall 
over there. Here is the way they set it 
up: If you are running for the House of 
Representatives and you raise small- 
dollar donations, then taxpayers will 
fund your campaign on a 6-to-1 match. 
It gets even better because you, as a 
candidate, could actually take a salary 
from that as well and actually be paid 
by the taxpayer to be able to run for 
office if you are running in the House 
of Representatives. Can we not have a 
disagreement on that? 
I don’t meet many people in Okla-
homa who say they want to fund House 
Members running in New York State or 
California or Illinois or even in Okla-
homa. They don’t want to fund them 
with their tax dollars. If their tax dol-
lars are going to education or roads or 
national defense or border security, 
they are all in, but if they are funding 
a political campaign with their tax dol-
lars, I just don’t meet many people who 
are very excited about that. But my 
Democratic colleagues are saying: If 
you don’t support that, I will blow up 
the Senate, and I will destroy 200 years 
of history in the functioning of the 
Senate to get my way because, to 
them, having Federal funding for elec-
tions is so important, they are willing 
to blow the Senate tradition up so they 
can get their way. 
There is a general counsel who works 
for the Federal Election Commission. 
You never met him. You don’t know 
his name. He is an attorney who works 
with the Federal Election Commission. 
Their bill gives that attorney a tre-
mendous amount of power to oversee 
elections in America. Do you know who 
he is? I don’t either. But if this bill 
passes, it is a pretty powerful indi-
vidual. Can we have a disagreement 
about that or is this about, if I don’t 
allow someone no one even knows their 
name, a Federal Election Commission 
attorney, to be able to run elections in 
the country, I will blow the Senate up. 
There is a section of it in this bill 
that talks about preclearance. We ac-
tually don’t know how many States 
would fall into preclearance on this. 
Many of my Democratic colleagues 
say: Well, it is not very many. You 
have to have some sort of violation in 
the past to be able to get it. But, actu-
ally, if you read the fine print in the 
bill, it says if there has been a consent 
or out-of-court settlement on things 
related to an election any time in the 
last 25 years, you would suddenly now 
be in preclearance. 
So, literally, 20 years ago, if your 
State made some agreement on elec-
tions, if there was some settlement 
that was done with DOJ during that 
time period, didn’t even go to court; 
you just settled it to resolve it—said, 
yes, that was a mistake that was 
done—now that is going to come back 
to haunt a future generation. 
And States will get drawn into 
preclearance, which—let me describe 
what that means. Preclearance means 
your State legislature can no longer 
pass legislation on elections until you 
contact the Attorney General of the 
United States and ask permission first. 
So now your State legislature works 
for the Attorney General of the United 
States, whoever that person may be in 
the future. It actually gives them the 
ability to be able to control anything 
on election law in your State, even 
though we don’t even know who that 
is, and we don’t know how many States 
are actually included. 
What I have heard over and over 
again from my Democratic colleagues 
is, well, if we don’t do this right now, 
our elections are destroyed in the fu-
ture because have you seen the things 
that Republicans are doing all over the 
country? Have you seen the terrible 
laws that have been passed since 2020? 
Actually, I have. My State is one of 
them. And I was surprised when I saw 
my State on the list of 34 different laws 
that are out there that have been 
passed that are terrible for America so 
we have to be able to federalize all 
elections. I was surprised to see my 
State on the list. When I looked on the 
list to see what was the terrible thing 
that passed in my State, here is what I 
discovered: Our State passed HB 2663. 
HB 2663 did a couple of things. It added 
an extra day of early voting for the 
general elections. They added an extra 
day of in-person early voting. 
And it said, if you request an absen-
tee ballot, you have to do that 15 days 
prior to the election. Do you know why 
we did that? Because the U.S. Postal 
Service contacted every State and 
asked them to do that because the 
Postal Service said: We can no longer 
guarantee we can get something mailed 
to a person and give them time to get 
it actually mailed back in time for the 
election. So to make sure people’s 
votes actually count, we did what the

actually 
rec-
ommended to us. We moved our request 
for an absentee ballot to 15 days before 
the election to make sure every vote 
would count. 
You want to know something fun? So 
did the State of New York. They made 
the exact same change. So, apparently, 
the State of New York is also into 
voter suppression the same as the 
State of Oklahoma is. 
Do you know what is really hap-
pening? My Democratic colleagues are 
running around the Nation getting on 
the news and saying there are 34 new 
laws passed by Republicans; they are 
destroying the right to vote. And ap-
parently no one in the media is saying, 
‘‘List one,’’ because if they would have 
listed one, they would have listed the 
State of Oklahoma added—added—an 
extra day of in-person voting and did 
what the U.S. Postal Service asked us 
to do, the exact same thing that the 
State of New York did. 
Let me give you some other things 
that have happened in other States. In 
Florida, there is a requirement that 
voters provide the last four digits of 
their Social Security number or their 
driver’s license number or their Florida 
ID number when they request a mail-in 
ballot to make sure it is actually them. 
It 
is 
pretty 
straightforward. 
That 
doesn’t sound like voter suppression; 
that sounds like just verifying that a 
person who is asking to vote by absen-
tee is actually the person voting. 
They made it very simple. You can 
just do any number. They are not even 
showing ID. They are saying you can 
just give the last four digits of your 
Social Security number, which every-
one has. All they are just trying to 
make sure is that person is actually 
there and is actually who they say they 
are, but they are listed as being voter 
suppression there. 
Arizona is requiring a voter signa-
ture on early ballots, as do a lot of 
States already. That has not been a big 
issue on that. 
In Louisiana—this is a really big one 
in Louisiana. Louisiana and Utah— 
now, I understand why Democrats are 
challenging this. In Louisiana and 
Utah, they required that deceased vot-
ers be taken off the voter rolls. Those 
who are decreased, they are taken off 
the voter rolls. That is being listed as 
voter suppression. 
I have to tell you. I have a friend of 
mine who said to me: When I die, would 
you make sure that I am buried in a 
blue State because I want to make sure 
I can continue to vote. It is a running 
old joke about ‘‘I want to keep voting 
when I am dead.’’ 
The State of Louisiana and the State 
of Utah, all they did was say: We want 
to be able to clean up our voter rolls to 
be able to take off the names of people 
we know and have verified that they 
are actually dead. But that is consid-
ered voter suppression, and my Demo-
cratic colleagues are running around 
the Nation saying there are 34 new laws 
that are suppressing the right to vote, 
when this is the kind of stuff that has 
actually been passed around the coun-
try. 
Now, they will say: Oh, you can list 
those; I understand those. But there 
are a couple of them that are really 
egregious. I have heard several folks 
say: Do you realize that the State of 
Georgia—the State of Georgia and the 
law that they passed won’t allow peo-
ple to be able to pass out water to peo-
ple in line? That is voter suppression. 
Well, did you know that new law in 
Georgia has been the old law in the 
State of New York for years so that 
you couldn’t campaign in line? People 
who are actual poll workers, who are 
volunteers there, they can pass out 
food and water. But the State of Geor-
gia did a law just like the State of New 
York already has. I haven’t heard Sen-
ator SCHUMER say that is voter sup-
pression in New York, but he declared 
that to be voter suppression in Geor-
gia. In fact, even Georgia Senators here 
stood up to be able to protest that they 
were playing baseball in Georgia be-
cause of it. The State of New York al-
ready has it. 
I have also heard folks say: Well, 
there are some of the things that these 
States have passed that they are actu-
ally removing the ability of the State 
chief election official to administer 
elections. That is dangerous because 
then just a legislature can declare who-
ever they want to declare. That sounds 
horrible. If true, that would be terrible. 
It just doesn’t happen to be factually 
true, but it is just getting spun like 
crazy that Republican States are out 
there taking away the rights of their 
people to be able to vote and their vote 
be counted. It is just not factually 
true. 
They will go to Georgia and say they 
stripped the Secretary of State’s au-
thority to oversee elections. Here is 
what Georgia actually did. The Georgia 
secretary of state is still the chief elec-
tion official for the State of Georgia. 
They still oversee all election activi-
ties in the State, nothing changed on 
that. But Georgia did replace the sec-
retary of state on the State election 
board with a nonpartisan chair, mak-
ing the secretary of state a nonvoting 
member. That did happen. The law did 
provide new authority to the board to 
suspend county or municipal election 
superintendents and to appoint super-
intendents to oversee the jurisdiction. 
Yep, that is part of the law, but that 
would only happen after an investiga-
tion by a performance review board, a 
hearing by the State election board. 
The board then must determine that 
the election administrator in the juris-
dictions committed at least three vio-
lations of State election law or as dem-
onstrated 
nonfeasance, 
malfeasance, 
gross negligence, and the administra-
tion of elections. It also prohibits the 
board from suspending more than four 
superintendents. It allows for a sus-
pended superintendent to petition the 
State for reinstatement. 
It adds a whole process of due process 
that actually gets carried out. Why do 
they do this? Well, because there were 
actual examples in the election of elec-
tion workers that were fired by the 
county elections directors for shred-
ding voter registration applications. 
That is a crime. 
So they set up a process with full due 
process not to overturn elections, but 
to make sure county election officials 
actually are following the law. That 
doesn’t sound like voter suppression to 
me. That just sounds like running free 
and fair elections. 
Oh, but Arizona—Arizona has a new 
law that provides the attorney general 
to have the authority to defend the 
State’s election laws in courts rather 
than the secretary of state, so they 
just shifted their responsibility of who 
defends State election laws. 
The secretary of state is still the 
chief election officer in Arizona but ac-
tually doesn’t go to court. Their State 
attorney general does. That kind of 
makes sense to me, but, apparently, 
my Democratic colleagues don’t agree. 
They have spun this whole web of myth 
and said, We have to federalize every 
election in America. We have to take 
over every State voting system in 
America. Washington, DC, needs to be 
the one to be able to run everything— 
or else if we don’t, we’ll destroy the 
traditions of the Senate and get our 
way no matter what. 
Could I just read to you from the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, the law that 
is still in place in America? 
It says: 
No voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting, or standard, practice, or procedure 
shall be imposed or applied by any State or 
political subdivision to deny or abridge the 
right of any citizen of the United States to 
vote on account of race or color. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, still 
the law of the land, and it should be. 
So what is happening now with this? 
Well, there are two big issues here. One 
is this fight over voting, whether 
States make decisions on voting or 
whether Washington, DC, Democrats 
make decisions on voting for their 
States, even if it is a Democrat State. 
And then the next big issue is, are 
the Democrats in this room actually 
going to destroy the filibuster and si-
lence the rights of the minority in 
America? Now, if you would have asked 
me 4 years ago, I would have said: No 
way, that is not going to happen, be-
cause a group of Democrats and a 
group of Republicans joined together 
and said: We are committed to not de-
stroying 
the 
legislative 
filibuster. 
Why? Because it is what makes the 
House and the Senate different. 
The House and the Senate are not 
just one is bigger and one is smaller. 
The House and the Senate operate dif-
ferently. And the Senate has been the 
place for two and a half centuries 
where the debate occurs and there are 
rights of individual Senators to be able 
to debate the issues, defend their 
State, and talk about the rights of 
Americans. This happens in the Senate. 
The majority rules the show in the 
House. If they have 218 of 435, they

don’t care what the other side thinks. 
People who always talk about biparti-
sanship never bring up the House of 
Representatives—they just don’t. Bi-
partisanship doesn’t happen in the 
House of Representatives the way it 
happens in the Senate, but the reason 
it happens in the Senate is because of 
this thing called the filibuster. 
It was interesting, when I was first 
elected to the Senate in 2014, the peo-
ple that called me between my election 
and when I came were almost all 
Democrats—almost all of them. They 
wanted to introduce themselves. They 
wanted to say: What are you interested 
in? Because in the Senate we have to 
work together to be able to get things 
done. 
And so I had all these Democrats 
that reached out to me to say: Let’s 
find areas of common ground. We are 
going to disagree on lots of things, but 
let’s find the things we are going to 
agree on because we have to come to 
consensus, because we are the U.S. 
Senate. 
That is commonly understood by 
Senators, which is why in 2017, in the 
middle of the year, a group of Repub-
licans and Senators wrote a letter— 
this letter—to MITCH MCCONNELL and 
CHUCK SCHUMER. In that letter—I am 
going to read it right here from this 
paragraph, it says: 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore— 
Here’s their request. 
Therefore, we are asking you to join us in 
opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate as 
we consider legislation before this body in 
the future. 
This group of Senators in 2017 wrote 
to MITCH MCCONNELL and CHUCK SCHU-
MER
and said: Do not allow any 
changes. We are fully committed to 
making no changes in the filibuster. 
Don’t allow it to happen for legisla-
tion. Don’t allow it. Here were those 
that signed this document and said: 
This is what we believe. 
KAMALA HARRIS, now Vice President 
of the United States; CHRIS COONS, who 
led the letter among all Democrats; 
PATRICK LEAHY is the person who has 
held this institution together; DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN; AMY
KLOBUCHAR; KIRSTEN 
GILLIBRAND; CORY
BOOKER; MICHAEL 
BENNET; JOE
MANCHIN; ANGUS
KING; 
MARK
WARNER; BOB
CASEY; MARTIN 
HEINRICH; JEANNE SHAHEEN; SHERROD 
BROWN; BRIAN
SCHATZ; MARIA

WELL; MAZIE HIRONO; JON TESTER; TOM 
CARPER; 
MAGGIE
HASSAN; 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH; TIM KAINE; JACK REED; Ed 
Markey; DEBBIE
STABENOW; SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE; BOB MENENDEZ—all said 
don’t change the legislative filibuster. 
In fact, they asked me, along with 
everyone else, to join them in opposing 
any efforts to make changes to the fili-
buster. It didn’t just stop there. There 
were lots of other conversations that 
happened during that time period. 
There were lots of interviews and dia-
logue about it. Let me just read some 
of the comments that were made dur-
ing that time period. 
George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s pro-
gram asked of DICK DURBIN, the No. 2 
leader for Democrats—asked DICK DUR-
BIN, ‘‘What do you think about doing 
away with the filibuster?’’ 
DICK DURBIN replied this in 2018: 
Well, I can tell you that would be the end 
of the Senate as it was originally devised and 
created going back to our Founding Fathers. 
We have to acknowledge our respect for the 
minority, and that is what the Senate tries 
to do in its composition and in its procedure. 
That is DICK DURBIN in 2018. 
JON TESTER was asked in 2019 about 
the legislative filibuster, and he said: 
I don’t want to see the Senate become the 
House. 
He then said: 
If you’re asking about the filibuster 
changes, I am a no. That would be a mistake. 
Senator ANGUS KING made this com-
ment in 2020. He said: 
I know it can be frustrating, but I think 
legislation is better when it has some bipar-
tisan support. 
Senator DIANNE
FEINSTEIN
in 2020 
said: 
I think it’s a part of Senate tradition, 
which creates a sobering effect on the body, 
which is healthy. 
One more comment from ANGUS 
KING. ANGUS KING was asked about it 
on CNN, about the filibuster, and he re-
plied back he is 100 percent opposed to 
killing the filibuster—100 percent. 
Senator 
CORY
BOOKER
responded 
about the filibuster. He said: 
My colleagues and I, everybody I’ve talked 
to, believe the legislative filibuster should 
stay there, and I will personally resist ef-
forts to get rid of it. 
Senator CHRIS
COONS, when asked 
about this in 2018, he replied: 
I am committed to never voting to change 
the legislative filibuster. 
Never. 
Senator JACKY
ROSEN
in 2019 was 
asked about this, and she replied: 
I think we should keep the [legislative] fil-
ibuster. It’s one of the few things that we 
have left in order to let all of the voices be 
heard here in the Senate. . . . 
She also said: 
We have to look not at just when you’re in 
the majority, but what does it do when 
you’re in the minority? You have to be mind-
ful of that. 
JEANNE SHAHEEN was asked on CNN 
about the legislative filibuster in 2021, 
and she answered just simply: 
No, I would not support eliminating the 60- 
vote threshold. 
Would not do it. 
Senator JACK REED was asked in 2017, 
during the same time period this letter 
came out, which he was a signatory 
for, and he said: 
The filibuster is not in the Constitution 
nor the original Senate rules, but we have a 
bicameral system for a reason and this legis-
lative tool serves a critical purpose in ensur-
ing the functioning of our democratic repub-
lic. Yes, it sometimes slows the process 
down, and some have abused or subverted it. 
But it remains an important part in our sys-
tem of checks and balances. 
I agree. I agree with that JACK REED. 
Senator BERNIE SANDERS even was 
asked about the filibuster in 2019, and 
he just replied: 
No, I am not crazy about getting rid of the 
filibuster. 
Senator MAZIE HIRONO from Hawaii 
said: 
I’m not particularly in favor of getting rid 
of the filibuster because that just means ma-
jority rule. That’s what happens in the 
House. 
Senator BOB CASEY was asked in 2019 
about the filibuster, and he just re-
plied: 
I’m a yes [on keeping the filibuster]. 
One 
of 
my 
favorites, 
Senator 
SHERROD BROWN was asked about this 
in 2019, and he replied: 
I think there are ways of getting things 
through Congress with the legislative fili-
buster still in place. . . . it takes a chief ex-
ecutive that knows what she’s doing or what 
he’s doing. 
Listen, this is not some trivial exer-
cise. This is 250 years of history my 
Democratic colleagues are planning to 
flush down the toilet because they 
don’t get their way on a bill we right-
fully have very strong philosophical 
disagreements on. 
Hey, I don’t agree on giving rapists 
and sex offenders who are convicted 
felons voting rights when they get out 
of prison; I am not alone on that. I 
don’t agree in Federal tax dollars being 
used to be able to pay for political 
campaigns. I am not alone in that. 
That is not that crazy. 
I don’t agree that my State should 
have to go play ‘‘Mother, May I’’ with 
some future Attorney General because 
they want to add another day of vot-
ing. I am not alone in that. But to say, 
‘‘If you don’t do this now, I will destroy 
the Senate’’, is a toxic shift for our Re-
public, and it is a violation of what you 
have said before in public, in fact, writ-
ten to the leadership of the Senate and 
said: Please don’t do this, and we will 
not do this. And now, years later go: It 
is not convenient. That was when we 
were in the minority. We had one opin-
ion. Now we have different core beliefs 
because we are in the majority. 
Interestingly 
enough, 
Joe 
Biden 
today stood in Georgia and made this 
statement. He said: 
Today I am making it clear: To protect our 
democracy, I support changing the Senate 
rules whichever way they need to be changed 
to prevent a minority of Senators from 
blocking action on voting rights. When it 
comes to protecting majority rule in Amer-
ica, the majority should rule in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Well, that is fascinating. Now that he 
is President of the United States, it is 
my way, or I will destroy the whole 
place. When he was Senator Joe Biden, 
he had a different opinion. 
Senator Joe Biden wasn’t about ‘‘I 
am the President, so I get what I

want.’’ Senator Joe Biden made this 
statement: 
Folks who want to see this change want to 
eliminate one of the procedural mechanisms 
designed for the express purpose of guaran-
teeing individual rights, and they also have 
a consequence, and would undermine the pro-
tections of a minority point of view in the 
heat of majority excess. 
But now he says: No. I am in the ma-
jority. I should get my way. 
Senator Joe Biden said: 
I have been here 32 years, most of the time 
in the majority. Whenever you are in the 
majority, it is frustrating to see the other 
side block a bill or a nominee you support. I 
have walked in your shoes, and I get it. . . . 
Getting rid of the filibuster has long-term 
consequences. If there is one thing I have 
learned in my years here, once you change 
the rules and surrender the Senate’s institu-
tional power, you never get it back. 
Senator Joe Biden said: 
Simply put, the nuclear option would 
transform the Senate from the so-called 
cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked 
about to cool the passions of the day to a 
pure majoritarian body like a Parliament. 
We have heard a lot in recent weeks about 
the rights of the majority and obstruc-
tionism. But the Senate is not meant to be a 
place of pure majoritarianism. Is majority 
rule what you really want? 
That is what he said as a Senator, 
but as President, his demand was, ma-
jority rule or we will break every rule 
in the Senate to get what we want. 
Senator SCHUMER, in his public state-
ments, has been very clear. ‘‘It would 
be doomsday for democracy,’’ he said, 
‘‘if you change the filibuster.’’ 
This is the statement Senator SCHU-
MER made in 2017, the same Senator 
SCHUMER who has spent the last 12 
months trying to find a way to tear 
down the filibuster. In 2017, when there 
was the debate going on around this, 
Senator SCHUMER said on the floor of 
the Senate, standing right there, ‘‘I 
hope the Republican leader and I,’’ he 
said, ‘‘can, in the coming months, find 
a way to build a firewall around the 
legislative filibuster, which is the most 
important distinction between the Sen-
ate and the House. Without the 60-vote 
threshold 
for 
legislation,’’ 
Senator 
SCHUMER said, ‘‘the Senate becomes a 
majoritarian 
institution 
like 
the 
House, much more subject to the winds 
of short-term electoral change. No Sen-
ator would like to see that happen so 
let’s find a way to further protect the 
60-vote rule for legislation.’’ 
That was Senator SCHUMER in 2017, 
but now it is: I am in power. I am going 
to do what I want. 
This is not a flippant issue, and as I 
have spoken to some of my Democratic 
colleagues, they seem to believe we 
will just take this vote and no one is 
going to care. In fact, some of my 
Democratic colleagues are saying: We 
know we are going to lose. Senator 
MANCHIN and Senator SINEMA have al-
ready made public comments. They are 
not going to go with this, or, we are 
going to take this, make a statement. 
Our progressive base wants us to be 
able to do this. It has no consequences. 
It is not going to pass anyway, so we 
will just do it—except they are forget-
ting that 5 years from now, 10 years 
from now, there will be another time 
just like this. Maybe Democrats will be 
in a slightly larger majority. Maybe 
Senator SINEMA and Senator MANCHIN 
won’t be here at that moment, and the 
majority leader, Democrat Senator, at 
that point will step forward and say: 
You voted on this in 2022. It is time for 
us to vote on it now. 
Democratic activists will rush at you 
and will say: Don’t you dare change 
what you did. Tear the place down. 
Let’s get what we want. 
I have spoken to so many of my col-
leagues and said: Don’t do this. 
They have quietly responded back to 
me: I don’t want to do this. 
I am not here to attack my col-
leagues. You each make your own deci-
sions. But these are decisions that 
matter. These are the decisions that 
100 years from now will still guide the 
direction of the Senate. These are the 
decisions that will direct our Republic. 
We are the only body that has a pro-
tection for the minority voice; I think 
the only legislative body in the world 
that is designed like this. It has been 
part of the secret sauce of America 
that the minority in America, however 
large or small it is, has a voice. 
My Democratic colleagues are now 
saying: We no longer want the minor-
ity to have a voice in America. If you 
are in the minority opinion, you don’t 
count. Sit down. Shut up. We are in the 
majority. 
That has never been the American 
way, not in 250 years. This has been the 
place where we have argued, debated, 
and where, yes, I have talked to House 
Members who have said good bills went 
to die. But the Senate has been the 
spot where all Americans get to speak. 
And my Democratic colleagues are se-
riously considering this week saying: 
No more, because we want to pass a 
voting bill that gives Federal dollars to 
House candidates and gives felons the 
right to vote and takes away voter ID. 
What in the world? What has this 
body become that people who signed 
this document, page after page of it—I 
mean, I could bring out page after page 
of Senators who have signed this and 
have said ‘‘Do not take away the legis-
lative filibuster’’ but now are just flip-
ping and flippant and saying it won’t 
matter. Yes, it does. One hundred years 
from now, this week will still matter. 
I encourage my Democratic col-
leagues to think carefully on this one 
because this one counts. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL L. HANNA 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise 
today to congratulate and honor the 
retirement of one of my senior staff 
members and friend who has served in 
my home State of Idaho for the last 13 
years as the regional director of my 
Lewiston office, Michael ‘‘Mike’’ L. 
Hanna. 
Following his retirement from the 
timber industry, Mike came to my 
staff after my first election to the U.S. 
Senate in May of 2009. I knew right 
away that he was a perfect fit for the 
regional director position in my Lewis-
ton office. As a result, my chief of staff 
and I hired him immediately following 
his interview. 
Mike was born in Boise, ID, and was 
raised there and in the Emmett Valley, 
where his parents’ families worked as 
farmers and sawmill workers. Growing 
up in a farming and timber family 
eventually led him to the University of 
Idaho, where he graduated with a bach-
elor of science degree in forest manage-
ment in 1976. 
Upon graduating from U of I, Mike 
began his 33-year career in the timber 
industry as a forester with the Idaho 
Department of Lands. After 12 years 
with 
the 
State 
of 
Idaho, 
he 
transitioned to the private sector, 
where he worked for Empire Lumber 
Company, Weyerhaeuser, and Three 
River Timber. 
Given his expertise and vast knowl-
edge of the timber industry, Mike was 
frequently called upon to participate in 
and lead collaborative groups and nat-
ural resource associations and organi-
zations. To name but a few, he was a 
founding member of the Clearwater 
Basin Collaborative, president of the 
Intermountain 
Logging 
Conference 
board of directors, president of the Re-
source Organization on Timber Supply, 
or ROOTS, president of the Clearwater 
Resource Coalition, and the chairman 
of the Forestry Committee of the 
Intermountain Forestry Association. 
He was also recognized by the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation for his U.S. 
Forest Service stewardship contract 
work. 
With his deep roots in Idaho and the 
timber industry, he was the perfect 
representative to the natural resource 
communities of the Clearwater Region, 
stationed out of my Lewiston office. 
During his 13 years of service as my re-
gional director, he advised and guided 
my office through many complicated 
issues, like the Idaho roadless rule im-
plementation, 
the 
salmon 
and 
steelhead management plans, Columbia 
River Treaty, Good Neighbor Author-
ity, tribal relations, and too many 
other issues to name. 
Mike and his wife Nancy have been 
married for 45 years and have made 
their home in Orofino, ID for 44 years, 
where they are an integral part of the 
fabric of the community. They have 
two children, Lindsay and Adam, and 
five grandchildren. 
It is always difficult to lose a trusted 
staff member of Mike’s character, ex-
perience, and knowledge, and I wish 
him and Nancy nothing but the best in 
their retirement and look forward to 
our continued friendship in the years 
ahead. 
Congratulations and thank you for 
your outstanding service to my staff 
and the citizens of Idaho.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
PALACE THEATER 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise to recognize the Pal-
ace Theater in Waterbury, CT as it 
celebrates 100 years of artistic achieve-
ment and advocacy. 
The Palace Theater originally opened 
on January 28, 1922. With the culmina-
tion of a $1 million investment in de´cor 
by Sylvester Z. Poli and the remark-
able architectural work of Thomas 
Lamb, the theater soon became a hub 
for cultural activity in Waterbury be-
fore the onset of World War II. 
The ornate building started as a 
movie and vaudeville house. Over the 
past century, the Palace has hosted a 
wide breadth of performances and pro-
ductions, from silent films to rock con-
certs and everything in between. In 
1983, the U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior honored the Palace Theater by 
listing it on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
In 1987, the theater closed for 18 
years. However, a 3-year, $30 million 
restoration, renovation, and expansion 
project impressively reshaped the Pal-
ace. When it reopened, the theater was 
a 
state-of-the-art, 
90,000-square-foot 
arena. Now a vast complex, the Palace 
is known as Greater Waterbury’s Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts. 
In its current state, the Palace hosts 
educational programming, Broadway 
tours, and a variety of family enter-
tainment. The theater’s team is com-
mitted to serving the greater Water-
bury community by establishing not 
just a magnificent artistic site but also 
a highly regarded educational and cul-
tural center. 
The Palace Theater is recognized as 
one of the premier arts facilities in 
New England, and I have had the privi-
lege of visiting on a number of occa-
sions to speak with the staff there. I 
am continuously impressed by the Pal-
ace’s record of achievement and the 
tireless dedication of everyone in-
volved to furthering arts education and 
advocacy for countless Connecticut 
residents and visitors. 
I applaud the theater on its extraor-
dinary history of accomplishment, and 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating the Palace Theater on 
100 years of excellence.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARK BENNETT 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, 
I rise today to commend Mark Bennett, 
who is retiring as chief of the water de-
velopment division of the Arkansas 
Natural Resources Commission after a 
34-year career creating and preserving 
access to water in our State. 
Through his work, Mark has helped 
provide clean, safe, and reliable water 
to countless Arkansans and has been 
instrumental in the conservation of 
our State’s land and water resources. 
Thanks to Mark’s dedication and com-
mitment to the people of Arkansas, he 
has ensured that future generations 
will be able to enjoy the beautiful land 
and wildlife the Natural State is 
known for. 
Mark is a true Arkansas success 
story. Raised near Lake Village and a 
graduate of Lakeside High School, 
Mark earned a bachelor’s degree in 
both agricultural economics and bank-
ing and finance from Mississippi State 
University. He continued his education 
at the University of Arkansas at Little 
Rock William H. Bowen School of Law

January 11, 2022 
and the University of Arkansas School 
of Law, where he earned a master of 
laws degree in agricultural law. 
Mark served the people of Arkansas 
as general counsel for the Arkansas 
Natural 
Resources 
Commission 
for 
nearly 20 years. He continued his pub-
lic service as the chief of water devel-
opment with the natural resources di-
vision of the department of agri-
culture. In this role, Mark oversaw a 
variety of crucial infrastructure pro-
grams including the Arkansas Clean 
Water Revolving Loan Program, the 
Arkansas Drinking Water Revolving 
Loan Program, the Arkansas Water De-
velopment Fund, and the Arkansas 
Water, Sewer and Solid Waste Fund to 
assist Arkansans with water, waste-
water, and solid waste projects. Mark 
has also served as the state cochair and 
member of the EPA—State SRF work-
ing group and is a former board mem-
ber and past president of the Council of 
Infrastructure Financing Authorities 
board of directors. 
I am grateful for Mark’s experience 
and expertise. His guidance was instru-
mental in crafting Federal legislation 
to modernize investment in water in-
frastructure. The Securing Required 
Funding for Water Infrastructure Now, 
or SRF WIN, Act was signed into law in 
2018 and is improving access to clean 
water in Arkansas and across the coun-
try. Mark’s knowledge in this field was 
invaluable as my staff and I developed 
this legislation. 
Generations of Arkansans will con-
tinue to benefit from Mark’s extraor-
dinary efforts to provide quality water 
infrastructure and further conserva-
tion efforts in our State. His dedication 
to improving the lives of his fellow Ar-
kansans is an inspiration, and I wish 
him the best of luck in retirement.∑

RECOGNIZING IDAHO OPERATION 
LIFESAVER 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I con-
gratulate Idaho Operation Lifesaver on 
its 50-year anniversary of working to 
keep people safe around railroad tracks 
and railway crossings. Thank you to 
all those involved with this highway/ 
rail safety effort for advancing rail 
safety across Idaho and our country. 
Idaho Operation Lifesaver was start-
ed in Post Falls, ID, in 1972 and was 
adopted in other States and nationally. 
According to Idaho Operation Life-
saver, the average number of highway/ 
rail incidents was 12,000 annually when 
Idaho Operation Lifesaver was created. 
Idaho Operation Lifesaver is credited 
with a 43-percent decrease in incidents 
in its first year following a 6-week pub-
lic 
awareness 
campaign 
started 
through 
cooperative 
work 
between 
then-Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, the 
Idaho State Police, and Union Pacific 
railroad. 
This effort is currently supported by 
78 volunteers across our great State of 
Idaho who assist with providing safety 
presentations to school groups, driver 
education classes, community mem-
bers, professional drivers, law enforce-
ment officers, and emergency respond-
ers. The group’s focus on education, en-
gineering, and enforcement is also part 
of its Officer on a Train Program, em-
ployed for the past nearly 30 years to 
decrease car-train collisions. Through 
the program, Idaho State Police Troop-
ers and Officers from local police de-
partments work together to stop driv-
ers committing track safety violations 
to prevent collisions, prevent tres-
passing on railroad property, and save 
lives. 
Idaho is filled with problem-solvers 
and doers. So it is no surprise this rail-
way safety effort got its start in our 
great State. I congratulate Idaho Oper-
ation Lifesaver on this significant 
milestone. I wish all those involved 
with Idaho Operation Lifesaver well, as 
you continue to work to keep people 
safe from rail accidents across our 
State and Nation.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE IDAHO FALLS 
AFRICAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., dreamed of a 
world of peace and equality, and hon-
oring his legacy is a central priority of 
the Idaho Falls African American Alli-
ance, or AAA. Today, I recognize the 
accomplishments of the Idaho Falls 
AAA and highlight their 15th Annual 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Banquet. 
The Idaho Falls AAA was formed in 
2006, when a few members of the com-
munity became aware of a local Afri-
can-American high school student in 
need of funds to travel to a regional de-
bate competition. One of these individ-
uals was the current Idaho Falls AAA 
president, David Snell. Growing up, his 
mother told him, ‘‘You should never be 
a part of a community that does not 
feel your presence. It is your personal 
responsibility to make sure your com-
munity is better because you were a 
part of it.’’ The group worked together 
to raise $300 and sponsored the trip for 
the talented debater. 
This experience sparked a movement 
as the group realized they could make 
a difference in the community and help 
other kids in need. AAA members also 
recognized an opportunity to promote 
diversity in the community, expand 
awareness of the contributions of Afri-
can Americans and other minorities, 
and begin to build a sense of under-
standing 
between 
cultures 
and 
ethnicities. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., influenced 
their mission, and they soon organized 
an annual MLK Banquet to provide the 
community an opportunity to learn 
from 
prominent 
African-American 
leaders. Over the past 15 years, guests 
have included Dr. Walter Massey, past 
president of Morehouse College; Pete 
Miller, former Undersecretary of En-
ergy; Freeman Hrabowski, voted one of 
TIME magazine’s 100 Most Influential 
People of 2012; and Idaho State Senator 
Cherie Buckner-Webb. 
This year’s AAA banquet will feature 
keynote speaker USAF Capt. Daniel 
‘‘Fuzz’’ Walker, the first African-Amer-
ican pilot qualified to fly the F–22 
stealth fighter plane, and grandson of 
one of the original Tuskegee Airmen. 
Ms. Michelle Amos, system engineer 
for NASA’s Perseverance, the 2020 Mars 
rover, will also deliver remarks over 
Zoom. Ms. Amos won an All-Star 
Award at NASA’s Women of Color Gov-
ernment 
and 
Defense 
Technology 
Awards 
Conference, 
is 
the 
former 
chairperson of NASA’s Black Employee 
Strategy Team, and is currently a pub-
lic affairs spokesperson for the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The organization has faced some 
challenges but has also received gen-
erous support from the Idaho Falls 
community. Many local businesses pro-
vide donations and services making the 
MLK Banquet possible each year. The 
proceeds from the annual event are 
used to support their mission to ‘‘fur-
ther the educational, economic, cul-
tural and development growth of the 
Idaho Falls African American Commu-
nity.’’ 
The Idaho Falls AAA serves to bring 
people together in times that can feel 
divisive. I commend the AAA and its 
membership for its work to help make 
Idaho Falls a better community.∑

LIFE AND LEGACY OF ODELL 
BARRY 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, along with 
Rep. ED PERLMUTTER, I rise in remembrance 
of my mentor and dear friend Odell Barry. 
After a lifetime of accomplishments Odell 
passed away on January 3rd at eighty years 
old. He is survived by his wife, Glenda, two 
sons, Jay and Damon, and five grandchildren. 
He was a tenacious football player and all- 
star athlete, making a lasting impression on 
the people of Colorado during his tenure as a 
Bronco. The records he set during his rookie 
year extend an unbeatable precedent for 
Bronco players to this day. 
Not only this, Odell was an inspirational po-
litical activist and public servant. He was the 
first Black American elected mayor in a major 
city in Colorado, serving the people of 
Northglenn for years on end. 
He was an entrepreneur and well-respected 
businessman. Odell’s greatest accomplish-
ment was the influence he had on the youth 
in Northglenn and across the state of Colo-
rado. His impact undoubtedly molded count-
less generations. 
Odell held all those around him to high 
standards, teaching us to live with generosity 
and compassion and lead with benevolence. I 
am deeply grateful to have known him. 
As a giant in many of our lives, the legacy 
Odell leaves behind will not soon be forgotten. 
My thoughts and prayers are with my dear 
friend, Glenda, and the entire Barry family. As 
we mourn his passing, we will remember his 
life and be inspired by his devotion to making 
this world a better place.

CLASS 1A IHSA STATE CHAM-
PIONSHIP 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Lena-Winslow High School 
football team for winning the IHSA State 
Championship for football. 
The 
Lena-Winslow 
Panthers 
beat 
the 
Carrollton Hawks 38–25 in the championship 
game of the IHSA Class 1A football playoffs. 
The Panthers added 2021 to their state cham-
pionship titles of 2019, 2017, 2013, and 2010, 
making them five-time champions. Running 
back Marey Roby finished with 241 rushing 
yards and three touchdowns, leading the team 
to their 5th win. I am pleased to see the Lena- 
Winslow Panthers representing the Lena com-
munity state-wide and I congratulate them on 
their win at the state championship. 
It is because of leaders such as the Lena- 
Winslow Panthers that I am especially proud 
to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate the Lena-Winslow football team 
on its win at the Class 1A IHSA State Cham-
pionship for football.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. KEVIN 
ROGERS 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous contributions of 
Dr. Kevin Rogers, Superintendent of Schools 
for the Lewisville Independent School District 
in Texas. After serving for six years in that po-
sition, it is my privilege to recognize Dr. Rog-
ers’ distinguished career in education as he 
enters retirement. 
Kevin Rogers, was born in Wichita Falls and 
raised in Andrews, Texas, graduated from Fort 
Stockton High School and obtained his under-
graduate degree at the University of North 
Texas. He then received his master’s degree 
from Texas Women’s University and his doc-
torate from UNT. 
Beginning his 36-year long career in edu-
cation as a Lewisville ISD science teacher, Dr. 
Rogers was then promoted to a supervisory 
role as the Assistant Principal of Marcus High 
School. He then served as the Arbor Creek 
Middle School Principal, Marcus High School 
Principal, and Lewisville ISD Chief Operations 
Officer prior to his appointment as Interim Su-
perintendent, 
Dr. Rogers’ contributions to Lewisville ISD 
include the introduction of Elementary STEM 
academies, Pre-kindergarten Discovery Acad-
emies, The Colony High School Collegiate 
Academy, and additional immersive Spanish 
classes at the middle school level. In order to 
further bolster the physical well-being of his 
students, Dr. Rogers also inaugurated Student 
Assistance Counseling and Behavior Interven-
tion into the register of Lewisville ISD services. 
Under his diligent stewardship, during the last 
school year, LISD served over 50,000 stu-
dents from 13 municipalities on 69 different 
campuses. His improvements to the school 
district’s operations will benefit future genera-
tions of students for years to come. 
The University of North Texas previously 
honored Dr. Rogers with the title of UNT Out-
standing Doctoral Student in Educational Ad-
ministration. The Lewisville Parent-Teacher 
Association also awarded Dr. Rogers with a 
Lifetime Achievement Award, and The Town 
of Flower Mound named him Citizen of the 
Year in 2016. 
I join the parents, teachers, and students of 
Lewisville ISD in congratulating Dr. Rogers on 
a long and successful public service career. In 
addition, I would like to sincerely thank him for 
the positive working relationship he fostered 
with my district office and the hospitality ex-
tended by LISD in hosting multiple congres-
sional events. Dr. Rogers has worked closely 
with my staff since his tenure as Marcus High 
School’s principal and has graciously allowed 
me to hold numerous Town Halls, Energy 
Summits, and Emergency Preparedness Sum-
mits at Lewisville ISD’s facilities. As he con-
cludes almost four decade of tireless service 
to the young men and women of North Texas, 
I wish him all the best in his well-earned retire-
ment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF AUBREY 
M. ‘BUCKY’ STANLEY, JR. 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Aubrey M. ‘‘Bucky’’ Stanley, 
Jr. of Hanover, Virginia, who passed away on 
December 31, 2021. Bucky was a longtime 
Hanover County resident who spent many 
years of his life serving his county. 
Bucky graduated from Patrick Henry High 
School and attended North Carolina State Uni-
versity. He returned to Virginia to work in the 
lumber and timber industry, first working with 
a family business, Stanley Lumber, and after 
that, owning his own company, AMS Timer, 
LLC. 
In 1983, Bucky won his first election in Han-
over, serving 38 years on the board, and six 
terms as chairman. He was the longest-serv-
ing Board of Supervisors member not only in 
the history of Hanover County, but the Com-
monwealth of Virginia as well. Bucky also 
served as chairman of the Capital Region Air-
port Commission for four terms. Bucky was a 
true servant leader in everything that he did 
and always put others first. 
In addition to serving his beloved Hanover, 
Bucky was passionate about softball, man-
aging and sponsoring teams including Stanley 
Lumber, Crossfire, Buckeye Softball, Mid-At-
lantic Softball, and Andy’s of Ashland. He trav-
elled around the nation to participate in the 
sport and was inducted into the Hall of Fame 
of several of the sports sanctioning organiza-
tions. 
Bucky was a great family man and showed 
his love to them in many ways. Bucky was 
preceded in death by his parents, Aubrey Mae 
Stanley Sr. and Helen Harris Stanley, and his 
wife, Ellen Epps Stanley. He is survived by his 
son, Darrell Stanley (Sheila) and his grandson, 
Wyatt Stanley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me and 
countless others as we recognize the life of 
Aubrey M. ‘‘Bucky’’ Stanley, Jr.

HONORING STEVE EDWARD MAR-
CHESE FOR HIS 29 YEARS OF 
FEDERAL SERVICE 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise as 
Chair of the Appropriations Committee, and on 
behalf of the Members of the Committee, and 
its staff, to pay tribute to Steve Edward Mar-
chese as he retires after 29 years of Federal 
service. Steve began his career with Senator 
Alan Dixon before eventually serving my 
former colleague Representative Sidney Yates 
as his Appropriations Associate. Steve left 
Congress moving over to the State Depart-
ment before coming home to the Appropria-
tions Committee, where he has spent the last 
15 years. 
During his service to the Committee, he 
spent four years as professional staff on the 
State and Foreign Operations (SFOPs) Sub-
committee. He eventually became the SFOPs 
Clerk and remained in that role for 10 years. 
During this time, Steve provided vital counsel 
to Members, which led to responsible invest-
ments through the SFOPs bill that made the 
world better, safer, and healthier while improv-
ing the security of generations throughout the 
world. He also spent considerable time and ef-
fort in compiling an anthology of the SFOPs 
bill that is an invaluable resource to the 
SFOPs subcommittee members. 
When I became Chair of the Appropriations 
Committee a year ago, Steve moved over 
from SFOPs to serve as the Legislative 
Branch Clerk. Steve undoubtedly thought this 
would be a break from world conflicts, but in-
stead found himself at the subcommittee’s 
helm, deeply involved in the aftermath of the 
January 6th attack. Madam Speaker, Steve 
did not disappoint and brought his trademark 
dedication to a suddenly critical position. 
Steve was instrumental in crafting the Emer-
gency Security Supplemental to Respond to 
January 6th Appropriations Act. As the Legis-
lative Branch Clerk, Steve’s hard work and 
dedication was very much appreciated and a 
great service to Congress and democracy. 
I speak for myself, and I am sure other 
Members and his colleagues, when I say we 
will miss Steve after he retires from Federal 
service this week. 
I am excited for what the future holds for 
Steve and wish him, his wife Cathy, and 
daughters Audrey and Julia all the best. Con-
gratulations on an outstanding career. His 
country thanks him for his hard work.

CONGRATULATING TODD GORMAN 
FOR 
WINNING 
THE 
NJCAA 
ESPORTS NATIONAL CHAMPION-
SHIP 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Todd Gorman on his national 
win playing Hearthstone at the NJCAA Esports 
competition. 
Todd has been playing Hearthstone since 
2015, and it is a game that involves strategy 
and skill to succeed. Hearthstone is a fast- 
paced, strategy-based computer card game in 
which players amass a collection of unique 
cards to build four decks of 20. Before each 
one-on-one match, both players can protect 
one of their decks and ban one of their oppo-
nent’s decks. And then they play a best-of-five 
series. In the championship, he earned a 3–0 
sweep over the runner-up from Bryant & Strat-
ton. This season, he has won 21 of 25 rounds 
played. I am pleased to see Todd representing 
the Knoxville community nationally. I congratu-
late Todd on his win at the national champion-
ship, and I look forward to seeing what he ac-
complishes in the future. 
IT is because of leaders such as Todd 
Gorman that I am especially proud to serve Il-
linois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Todd Gorman on his winning of the 
NJCAA Esports National Championship.

HONORING 100 YEARS OF VFW 
POST 857 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 857 
of Fort Wayne as they prepare to celebrate 
their 100-year anniversary. 
Founded less than five years after the end 
of the First World War, VFW Post 857 has 
been a fellowship among American patriots in 
and around Fort Wayne all of whom served 
our country at some point in overseas conflict 
for now a century. With over 500 members in-
cluding an Auxiliary, Post 857 remains a most 
honorable and beloved local institution. 
This institution over the years and genera-
tions has been the fraternal home of patriots 
like Donald Kurtz, Edwin Davis, David Roth, 
Don Van Osdale, Edgar Grider, and so many 
others. I am inspired by these men and the 
mission of the organization to which they be-
longed—a mission which includes not only 
helping veterans recover from the wounds of 
war but, even more importantly, to ensure that 
the memory of those who have served is 
never forgotten. 
From holding raffles to support the home re-
pairs of veterans to throwing children’s Hal-
loween parties to hosting motorcycle rides 
alongside Northeast Indiana Honor Flights, 
and more, Hoosiers thank Fort Wayne’s VFW 
Post 857 for their service and stewardship to 
the community over the years and genera-
tions. 
This record is testament to VFW Post 857’s 
longevity and achievement, for which Indiana, 
and northeast Indiana, is grateful. May God 
bless them, and may God Bless the United 
States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE TAOS NEWS 2021 
TRADICIONES UNSUNG HEROES 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the incredible lives 
and work of the Taos News 2021 Tradiciones 
unsung heroes. It was my honor to join all of 
them on their big night of celebration. The sto-
ries they shared and the work they do for the 
community are more important than words can 
describe. I feel very fortunate to have attended 
such a special event surrounded by such self-
less and inspiring people. 
It was an honor to hear Benito Concha 
share his heartfelt story in person. I’m happy 
that he shared a gift with all the unsung he-
roes of the night. We all need to do more to 
uplift the good work and the heroes who de-
liver. All and all he’s an incredible example of 
why it is so important to listen to the wisdom 
of our Native elders. 
I thank Judy Weinrobe for bringing the won-
derment and love of our state to a group like 
Los Jardines. I often hear how easy it is to fall 
in love with our state. She is an example of 
why. She adds beauty to our community 
through her work. We recognize the beauty of 
her labor. Keep planting the seeds. 
Bette Myerson can’t retire for the last time 
if she does what she loves. Especially if what 
she loves is a necessity, repairing the world. 
I think we were destined to meet because we 
do the same work. Best wishes to Bette and 
her family. I know she’ll continue to do good. 
Anita Bringas is a true asset as a strategic 
support manager. The way she can easily 
connect people, time, and tradition is the es-
sence of New Mexico. We are all different and 
beautiful. It’s understanding each other and 
caring that makes this place truly unique. The 
moment she shared with her mom was one I’ll 
always remember. 
As a founder of the women’s shelter, 
HEART of Taos, the world needs more people 
like Kathryn Herman. Someone who is called 
to action to fill a void without the intention of 
becoming a hero but is one. She’s saved 
countless women and children. There is no-
body who has a bigger heart than Kathryn. 
She is the person who we all should aspire to 
be. 
The beauty of Questa, New Mexico doesn’t 
end with its scenery—it extends to its people 
and there is no better example than Malaquias 
Rael, Jr. He is an inspiration. The work he has 
done to diversify and promote sustainability 
serves as a model for the state and other 
communities. In small towns, it’s important we 
remain a community and truly live as neigh-
bors who look out for each other. 
It’s a rarity to see people as generous as 
Roels ‘‘Roy’’ Cunnyngham, especially when it 
comes to donating land for the community. 
Those actions promote the health, welfare, 
and economy of our community, echoing long 
after the deed is handed over. It’s people like 
Roy who will ensure that Taos grows and 
prospers for decades to come. 
Lisa Abeyta-Valerio is a treasure to her 
community but more importantly, to our youth. 
Her passion as a cheerleader coach con-
stantly reminds us of this. Taos may be a 
small community, but there is no shortage of 
champions. With someone as caring as Lisa in 
the driver seat, we’ll never get lost. 
Pauline Mondragon’s story as a fighter and 
cancer survivor inspires all. Having been there 
myself, I understand how strong she must be 
to do as much as she has. Pauline devotes 
her time and energy for everything that we 
value as Nuevo Mexicanos. When the pan-
demic passes, we will all be able to celebrate 
her and the great heroes of our community.

The progress and change he fostered during

more that bring peace, prosperity, and har-

OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

and Lorena Wright in Parsons, Kansas. While 
stationed in Sioux City, Iowa with the United 
States Army he was joined in marriage to his

1943. From July of 1942 to December of 
1945, Marion faithfully and patriotically served 
his nation which was in the midst of the Sec-
ond World War. Not only did he serve as a 
Military Policeman but, he was also deployed 
to Europe in 1945 where he was a Gunner on 
a halftrack and a Tank Operator. Marion would 
fondly recall meeting Jimmy Stewart who was 
training to fly B–52s in Sioux City. On his re-
turn home from deployment in Europe, Marion 
crossed the Atlantic on the famous troopship, 
The Queen Mary. 
At home after the war, Marion could be 
found working the field, restoring antique fur-
niture, or joyfully attending to the needs of his 
beautiful wife and children. Marion had a ca-
reer at Kustom Electronics where he worked 
in the shipping department. As a member of 
the American Legion, he remained close to 
many of his brothers in arms in the years after 
the war. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capital to recognize 
Marion E. Wright’s patriotism and devotion to 
God, 
Family, 
and 
Country. 
Furthermore, 
Madam Speaker, I extend my personal condo-
lences to the Wright family for the loss of such 
an extraordinary man of service and duty. May 
God rest the soul of this great American.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHN MADDEN 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of one of football’s 
greatest icons, John Madden. First, I would 
like to extend my sincere condolences to Vir-
ginia, Joseph, Michael, and the entire Madden 
family on the loss of their beloved husband, 
father, and grandfather who left such an indel-
ible mark on our Las Vegas Raiders and the 
American football landscape. John Madden 
once said, ‘‘If you think about it, I’ve never 
held a job in my life. I went from being an NFL 
player to a coach to a broadcaster. I haven’t 
worked a day in my life.’’ While he may not 
have felt he worked a day in his life, Mr. Mad-
den certainly accomplished a lot and helped 
others do the same. 
As a young man, he recognized the impor-
tance of an education and utilized his football 
prowess to pursue his dreams. His grit and 
determination on both the offense and defense 
at Cal Poly were recognized by pro scouts 
and he was drafted into the National Football 
League (NFL). Unfortunately, his professional 
playing time was cut short by injuries, but this 
was only the first step in a stellar career. 
Initially hired as a defensive coach, after two 
years with the Raiders organization he was 
promoted to head coach at 32 years of age, 
making him the youngest NFL coach ever to 
lead a team. Over the next decade, his Raid-
ers teams personified owner Al Davis’s motto, 
‘‘Just win, baby.’’ Under Madden’s inspired 
leadership, the Raiders won seven Western 
Division titles and made eight playoff appear-
ances in 10 years. Mr. Madden’s team de-
feated the Minnesota Vikings led by Fran 
Tarkenton, 32–14, in Super Bowl XI, when he 
cleared the Raider bench to be sure every ac-
tive player saw game action. Afterwards, Mad-
den was memorably carried off the field on his 
players’ shoulders and commented, ‘‘I’ll never 
take off the Super Bowl ring. It’s something I 
will always cherish.’’ Along with owner Davis, 
five of the Raider players would later be in-
ducted into the Football Hall of Fame. Madden 
would join them in 2006. Today he still holds 
the highest winning percentage of any coach 
who has won 100 or more games. 
Mr. Madden’s players respected his vision, 
elevating their play and creating a style all 
their own. They raised the competitive level of 
the game and set the standard that many 
teams still try to emulate today. Their loyal 
fans, Raider Nation, also personify defiance, 
struggle, and the will to win. During his tenure 
he also made great strides in diversifying the

game, working with scouts to find minority tal-
ent where many had not searched before and 
providing new avenues to stardom that many 
had not dreamed possible. 
Following his retirement in 1979, Madden 
entered the broadcast booth. He had a way 
with words that synched perfectly with his 
longtime play-by-play partners, Pat Summerall 
and Al Michaels. Mr. Madden brought an as-
tute balance to their relationships in the booth, 
redefining the color commentator role for all 
sports and painting a picture the audience 
could truly understand that added to their 
game watching experience. 
Coach Madden once noted he wished to 
live out the story of one of his favorite books, 
Travels with Charley: In Search of America by 
John Steinbeck. Mr. Madden’s fear of flying 
made this dream possible, as he crisscrossed 
our country by bus during the season to en-
sure he was able to call games in person from 
coast to coast. Traveling around the country in 
the ‘‘Madden Cruiser,’’ he connected with 
countless football fans all over the United 
States. Many of the Americans he met along 
the way had been introduced to the game of 
football by his booming voice on TV or his 
namesake video game; and Madden was al-
ways generous with his time, sharing stories 
with fans of all ages. 
John Madden’s legacy will live on in the 
words spoken by Raiders’ owner Mark Davis 
as he lit the torch at Allegiant Stadium in Las 
Vegas on December 28, 2021, ‘‘The fire that 
burns the brightest in the Raiders Organization 
is the will to win.’’

RECOGNIZING 
FRANK 
W. 
ZARDECKI FOR HIS 62 YEARS OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Frank W. Zardecki for his 62 
years of service to our country. A veteran of 
the United States Air Force, he has served as 
the Deputy Commander of Tobyhanna Army 
Depot for 32 years, supporting the organiza-
tion and the 4,000 personnel who perform di-
versified logistics, administrative, and related 
support missions. On January 6, Frank was 
honored for his contributions and achieve-
ments in the role. 
Frank answered the call of duty and joined 
the United States Air Force in 1960 and 
served until 1964. On January 4, 1966, he 
began working as an electronic test equipment 
repairer at the Tobyhanna Army Depot. In 
1972, he was promoted to his first supervisory 
role in the avionics branch, and, by 1976, he 
was named a general foreman. 
From 1982 to 1984, Frank served as the 
Depot’s first Force Modernization Officer. He 
served as Chief of the Production Engineering 
Department, chosen for his experience, tech-
nical ability, and managerial skills. In 1985 and 
1986, he was selected by DESCOM, the two- 
star headquarters command, for a special as-
signment as the Civilian Executive Assistant at 
the Sierra Army Depot in California, where he 
was responsible for directing the ammunition 
and special weapons missions performed at 
the instillation. When he returned, he was pro-
moted as the Chief of the Shops Division in 
the Maintenance Directorate. In 1988 and 
1989, he served as the Deputy Director of 
Maintenance. 
In December 1990, he received a temporary 
promotion to Acting Deputy Commander, and 
in June 1991, he was permanently installed in 
the role, beginning his three-decade tenure in 
the position, making him the longest-serving 
Deputy Commander in Tobyhanna Army 
Depot history. The Depot has thrived under 
Frank’s direction, transitioning from a tradi-
tional repair depot to a state-of-the art logistics 
service center that provides comprehensive 
maintenance, repair engineering, and logistics 
services for the entire Department of Defense 
as well as thousands of jobs in Northeastern 
Pennsylvania. The Secretary of the Army 
named Tobyhanna Army Depot the Center for 
Industrial and Technical Excellence for Com-
munications, Electronics. Avionics, and Missile 
Guidance and Control Systems. The Depart-
ment of Defense has also recognized the 
Depot with the Robert T. Mason Depot Main-
tenance Excellence Award, and the Depot has 
been the recipient of seven Shingo Awards for 
manufacturing excellence. 
For his efforts and expertise, Frank has 
been called to serve on numerous Department 
of the Army and Department of Defense spe-
cial studies on military logistics, and he is 
widely recognized as a leader in depot mainte-
nance. Throughout his career, Frank has re-
ceived many awards for his contributions to 
the field. He has received the Department of 
Defense Exceptional Civilian Service Award, 
two Department of the Army Decoration for 
Exceptional Civilian Service Awards, the Meri-
torious Civilian Service Award, four Superior 
Civilian Service Awards, the Commander’s 
Award for Civilian Service, and other perform-
ance and special service awards. 
I am honored to join Tobyhanna Army 
Depot in recognizing Frank for his six decades 
of service to the nation as a veteran of the 
United States Air Force and dedicated public 
servant at the Tobyhanna Army Depot. Frank 
has been instrumental in the growth and suc-
cess of the Depot, and we are grateful for his 
vision and dedication. I wish him the best in 
his retirement.

CELEBRATING ELEANOR HENLEY 
ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th Birthday of World War 
II veteran and Peoria, Illinois resident Eleanor 
Henley. 
Born on January 2, 1922 in Kunkletown, 
Pennsylvania, Eleanor devoted her life to fight-
ing for our country and helping others reach 
their potential. She enlisted in the Women’s 
Army Corps in 1944, completing her basic 
training in Oglethorpe, Georgia. After stopping 
at different bases across the country for sup-
plementary job and overseas trainings, she 
earned an assignment to the Army Air Force. 
Climbing aboard the troop transport ship, the 
Aquitania, she sailed across the Atlantic 
Ocean to join her fellow American soldiers at 
a base near Cambridge, England. She was a 
member of the 8th Air Force, better known as 
The Mighty Eighth. While stationed there, she 
typed and decoded messages as she helped 
provide intelligence to boost the Allies’ efforts 
on the ground until Germany’s surrender. She 
was then transferred to France and was even-
tually discharged as Sergeant Eleanor Henley, 
traveling back stateside on the Queen Mary. 
She married her husband, whom she met 
while serving, Conrad Stewart, soon after re-
turning home. They were together for 63 years 
until his death, raising three children, 11 
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 
Looking for new ways to continue serving her 
community, she graduated from Peabody Col-
lege with a degree in education. She relocated 
to Illinois shortly thereafter and became a 
teacher in Peoria Public Schools District 150, 
where she mentored and uplifted students for 
28 years. 
It is because of heroic, selfless, and trail-
blazing leaders such as Eleanor Henley that I 
am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally celebrate Eleanor 
Henley on her 100th Birthday and thank her 
for her service to the United States of Amer-
ica.

CELEBRATING LEARNED DAVIS 
BARRY’S LEGAL CAREER 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to celebrate Mr. 
Learned Davis Barry on the occasion of his re-
tirement. 
Mr. Barry has deep ties to the Common-
wealth of Virginia. He earned his B.A. from the 
University of Virginia, his J.D. from the Univer-
sity of Richmond Law School, and was admit-
ted to practice law in the Commonwealth on 
May 21, 1974, almost 50 years ago. 
Mr. Barry’s commitment to service has been 
a hallmark of his legal career. He followed in 
his father’s footsteps by registering for military 
service, serving as an Air Force JAG officer 
for four years following his graduation from 
law school. Over the next forty-four years of 
Mr. Barry’s career, he served as a prosecutor 
in the Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney’s 
Office, the Henrico Commonwealth’s Attor-
ney’s Office, and the Chesterfield Common-
wealth’s Attorney’s Office. 
As he progressed throughout his career, Mr. 
Barry took on increasingly robust and chal-
lenging roles as a public servant. He served 
as the Special Prosecutor responsible for run-
ning the multi-jurisdictional Grand Jury for the 
City of Richmond and the counties of Henrico 
and Chesterfield. When he returned to the 
Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office 
in the early 2000s, Mr. Barry created a ‘‘Mur-
der Program’’ in the office, focusing on the 
successful investigation and prosecution of 
homicides in Richmond. This work resulted in 
a high clearance rate for murder cases in the 
City of Richmond, including the infamous mur-
der of the Harvey family on New Year’s Day 
2006. 
However, Mr. Barry’s most lasting legacy is 
the impact he has had on the hundreds of

that 
he

Through his advice and training over the dec-
ades, prosecutors in Richmond, Henrico, and 
Chesterfield gained a deeper knowledge of 
and respect for the law.

me in recognizing Mr. Learned Davis Barry for 
his devotion to the public good and decades 
of committed service as a prosecutor.

2021 NEW JERSEY THESPIANS ALL- 
STATE SHOW SONGS FOR A NEW 
WORLD 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the hard work and 
dedication of the great students, teachers, and 
staff members of Ewing and Hopewell Valley 
Central High School, among other schools 
across the great state of New Jersey, for their 
participation in the 2021 New Jersey Thes-
pians All-State Show Songs for a New World. 
From acting on the big stage, directing the 
show to lighting design, Elliot Block, Ryan 
Dwyer, Olivia Gross, Molly Higgins, Chloe 
Lumond, David LaRaus, Olivia Levin, Nia 
Whaley, Fatima N’diaye, Jack Creegan, Kath-
erine Rochon, Jason Wylie, Jenna Parilla 
Alvino, Jessica Bohenberger, and Carolyn Lit-
tle, dazzled us all and showcased great com-
mitment to representing our state on a na-
tional level at the International Thespian Fes-
tival. 
Under the direction of Katherine Rochon, for 
the first time ever, a New Jersey show was 
selected to have a main stage performance at 
the 2021 International Thespian Festival. Even 
during this historic time in history, when a pan-
demic is changing the layout of our class-
rooms, these students, teachers, and staff 
members committed their time to bring joy to 
our community. This display of courage and 
the betterment of their craft attest to the kind 
of leadership and tradition that can only be ob-
tained when we persevere through adversity. 
On behalf of the great state of New Jersey, 
I would like to formally congratulate these 
great individuals for not only this outstanding 
achievement but for their amazing display of 
teamwork and dedication.

REMEMBERING ALASKAN PHILAN-
THROPIST EDWARD RASMUSON 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of my friend and great Alas-
kan, Edward Rasmuson, a philanthropist and 
founder of The Rasmuson Foundation. Ed 
passed away on January 4, 2022, at the age 
of 81. I offer my deepest condolences to his 
family and loved ones, as well as those whose 
lives he impacted across his lifetime who are 
thinking of him now. 
Ed Rasmuson was a man of many accom-
plishments. Everything Ed sought to accom-
plish in his lifetime he did. Throughout his life 
Ed gained much more than the monetary 
wealth from good business and financial in-
vestment; he sought to help others and influ-
ence our state. I’m proud to have worked with 
him closely over the years, but I am even 
prouder to have called him my friend. 
The works of Ed and his family will continue 
through the foundation his family created, in 
efforts to help Alaskans reach their full poten-
tial. This philosophy and thought of living be-
yond oneself and giving without an expecta-
tion of anything in return sets the precedent 
for living a philanthropical lifestyle. I could not 
be more grateful for the giving heart of this 
man and his family towards the people of 
Alaska. 
The Rasmuson Foundation provides funding 
towards combatting homelessness, improving 
health care, the arts, community development, 
ending domestic violence, preventing child 
abuse, and helping seniors. Although he may 
no longer be with us, his work and the work 
of the Rasmuson Foundation will continue to 
support and inspire future Alaskans for gen-
erations to come. 
Ed dedicated his life to Alaska and the peo-
ple who call the Last Frontier home. We honor 
his legacy and mourn his loss alongside his 
family. Please join me in keeping the 
Rasmuson family in your prayers.

IN RECOGNITION OF WANDA 
YOUNG 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the late and legendary, Wanda 
Young, former singer of the renowned Motown 
Marvelettes and resident of Inkster in Michi-
gan’s 13th Congressional District. 
Ms. Young was born in Eloise, Michigan 
and was raised in Inkster. It was there that 
she made her mark on Motown, our commu-
nity’s culture, and music history. Ms. Young 
was asked to join a local singing group, com-
prised of Inkster High School students and 
alumni, when one of its members had to drop 
out. They were immediately impressed by her 
vocal range. The group, now known as the 
Marvelettes, had previously auditioned with 
Barry Gordy of Motown Records and was 
quickly signed to the Tamla record label, later 
known as Motown Records. They earned 
Motown one of its biggest hits with their best- 
known song, ‘‘Please, Mr. Postman.’’ 
Wanda Young sang lead on many of the 
Marvelettes’ recordings, including hit songs 
‘‘Don’t Mess Around with Bill’’ and ‘‘I’ll Keep 
Holding On.’’ Ms. Young was an integral part 
of the Motown music scene and defining the 
sound of the 1960s. She has been a paragon 
to countless women and African-American 
performers inspired by her example. 
Please join me in recognizing Wanda 
Young’s contributions to our country, music 
and Michigan’s 13th District Strong as we 
honor her legacy and her impact on history at 
home and across the globe. 
RECOGNIZING 
DAVE 
WILLIAMS 
FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO AG-
RICULTURAL BROADCASTING 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dave Williams for his two dec-
ades of service to the Pennsylvania agricul-
tural community as a farm broadcaster, owner 
of the Pennsylvania Farm Country & American 
Farm County Radio Network, and producer of 
Pennsylvania Country Roads TV. In February 
2021, he received the 2021 Gerald W. 
Reichard Impact Award from the Pennsylvania 
Farm Show, and he received the Barn Raiser 
Award at the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau’s 
71st Annual Meeting on November 16, 2021. 
Dave was born in Wayne County, Pennsyl-
vania and raised on a five-generation family 
farm in Cherry Ridge. At age twelve, he took 
over a herd of 30 dairy cows and was active 
in 4–H. Dave then joined the military, and, 
after his service, he helped manage a 5,000- 
acre cattle ranch in Texas. With his late wife, 
Melba, he leased a 50-acre mule farm while 
working in the oil drilling business. 
When he returned to Wayne County, he 
worked as a fleet manager in the trucking in-
dustry while returning to his agricultural roots 
on the weekends, farming and raising sheep 
and cows. He was named the president of the 
Pocono Mountains Antique Farm Association, 
doing shows at local fairs. 
In the fall of 1998, Marilyn Shaffer of the 
Wayne County Farm Bureau, who was a fel-
low member of the antique machinery club, 
asked 
Dave 
to 
do 
a 
radio 
show 
for 
Honesdale’s radio station. Dave pitched his 
idea for a radio show that would not only tar-
get farmers and their concerns but also the 
consumers who buy and eat the food. The 
station gave Dave the green light, and his first 
show featured Leroy Van Dyke, a popular 
country singer, as his initial guest. The show 
would go on to host state and federal legisla-
tors, governors, and state agricultural officials. 
One of the highlights of his program is the 
‘‘heartland stories’’ from farmers themselves, 
and Davie shares his own stories of growing 
up on and managing his family’s farm. Dave is 
especially skilled at building a rapport with 
farmers and encouraging them to use their 
voice and the radio show platform to share 
their successes and concerns, helping con-
sumers understand the agricultural process. 
Dave joined the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau 
first as an officer and later as state director, 
and he served as a state delegate to the 
American Farm Bureau Association, through 
which he met Orion Samuelson, host of U.S. 
Farm Report, who told him he needed to be 
a National Farm Broadcaster. Dave then 
joined the National Association of Farm Broad-
casting (NAFB), and later hosted Samuelson 
on his show. After connecting with Pennsyl-
vania Cable Network at the Pennsylvania 
Farm Show, he was invited to have his own 
show on the network which reaches an audi-
ence of 3.5 million. 
I am honored to recognize Dave for his sto-
ried broadcasting career. His work has contrib-
uted immeasurably to the visibility of the agri-
cultural community both in Pennsylvania and 
across the country, and I am grateful for his

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PASSING OF VICE 
ADMIRAL PAUL FREDERICK FOS-
TER, USN 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 50th anniversary of the passing of 
Vice Admiral Paul Frederick Foster, USN. 
Over his distinguished 23-year career in the 
United States Navy, Vice Admiral Foster be-
came the first naval officer to be awarded the 
Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, 
and our nation’s highest military distinction, 
the Medal of Honor. 
Born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of a Con-
gregationalist minister, he spent his early 
years traveling the west with his father, living 
in Kansas, Utah, Oklahoma, and Idaho before 
his appointment to the United States Naval 
Academy. At the academy, he reached the 
rank of cadet commander and served as com-
mander of the Midshipmen Battalion. Upon 
graduation in 1911, he was assigned to var-
ious postings in the Caribbean Sea. In 1914, 
then-Ensign Foster took part in the Battle of 
Veracruz during the United States’ intervention 
against Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. At 
the head of his company, he led his sailors 
ashore during the fighting on April 21 and 22, 
1914. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for 
his leadership, heroism, and courage under 
enemy fire. His commendation cites that ‘‘Ens. 
Foster was eminent and conspicuous in his 
conduct, leading his men with skill and cour-
age’’. 
Upon his return to the United States in 
1915, Vice Admiral Foster became one of the 
first American naval officers to undergo sub-
marine instruction. He served as executive of-
ficer on the experimental submarine G–4 and 
participated in maneuvers along the Eastern 
Seaboard. When the United States joined the 
Allies in World War I, Vice Admiral Foster was 
sent to England and served on U.S. Sub-
marine L–2. In 1918, he was awarded the 
Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his part 
in sinking one of the three enemy submarines 
during the war. 
After World War I, he returned to peacetime 
duty back in the United States. In 1924, during 
a training accident on the USS Trenton, with 
total disregard for his safety, Vice Admiral 
Foster entered a burning gun turret and extin-
guished the fire both inside the turret and on 
the clothing of the crew members, saving their 
lives. For this act of valor, he was decorated 
with the Navy Cross. He retired from active 
duty in 1929 but remained a member of the 
Navy Reserve. 
Vice Admiral Foster was recalled to active 
duty in 1941 following the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly 
tasked him to conduct special naval inspec-
tions worldwide during the Second World War. 
As Assistant Inspector General of the Navy, 
Vice Admiral Foster examined bases across 
the globe, overseeing operations and ensuring 
the security, effectiveness, and safety of U.S. 
naval operations in North America, Europe, 
and the Pacific. He received the Legion of 
Merit and Navy Commendation Medal War for 
his essential service. He retired from the Navy 
fully in October 1946 with the rank of vice ad-
miral. 
The end of his military service did not mark 
the end of his career in public service. In 
1954, Vice Admiral Foster was appointed by 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be the as-
sistant general manager for international ac-
tivities at the Atomic Energy Commission 
(AEC) and later general manager of the com-
mission, advancing the United States’ peaceful 
pursuit of atomic power. Finally, in 1959, 
President Eisenhower appointed him perma-
nent U.S. representative to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, furthering 
U.S. leadership in managing the peacetime 
development of atomic science and tech-
nology through the ‘‘Atoms for Peace’’ initia-
tive. During his service in Vienna, he had the 
opportunity to meet with several world leaders, 
including Pope John XXIII. After retiring in 
1961, Vice Admiral Foster settled in Virginia 
Beach. He passed away on Jan. 30, 1972, at 
the age of 82. In a tribute to his years of serv-
ice, the Spruance-class destroyer USS Paul F. 
Foster was named in his honor in 1976. 
A true American hero, Vice Admiral Foster’s 
legacy lives on through his family, friends, and 
commitment to service to his country. I hope 
the rest of my colleagues will join me in hon-
oring his memory on the 50th anniversary of 
his passing on Jan. 30, 2022.

CONGRATULATING 
DR. 
ANDREA 
TALENTINO 
ON 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
NINTH 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
AUGUSTANA COLLEGE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dr. Andrea Talentino, who has 
been named the ninth President in the rich, 
161-year history of Augustana College located 
in Rock Island, Illinois. Her first day will be 
July 1, 2022. 
After earning a bachelor’s degree from Yale 
University and doctorate from UCLA, Dr. 
Talentino has dedicated her professional ca-
reer to helping our next generation prepare for 
the future. She perfected the art of teaching 
and mentored countless students as a mem-
ber of faculty at Tulane University. Committed 
to becoming more versed in all aspects of 
higher education, Dr. Talentino developed her 
leadership 
administrative 
and 
supervisory 
skills as Associate Dean at Drew University 
and Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at 
Norwich University. Her proven work ethic and 
detail-oriented approach afforded her the op-
portunity to become Provost at Nazareth Col-
lege, her most recent position. Dr. Talentino 
will strive to provide an all-encompassing and 
inclusive 
educational 
experience 
for 
the 
Augustana community. 
It is because of passionate and selfless 
leaders such as Dr. Andrea Talentino that I 
am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally congratulate Dr. 
Andrea Talentino on being announced as the 
ninth President of Augustana College.

touchdown passes; running back Keagan 
LaBelle ran for 76 yards and two touchdowns; 
and Ashden Gentry scored a 59-yard intercep-
tion return. 
Congratulations to first-year coach Vince 
Lidy and the entire football team for their in-
credible accomplishments and hard work this

CELEBRATING 
THE 
TRICENTEN-
NIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
TOWN 
OF 
BARRINGTON, 
NEW 
HAMPSHIRE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the tricentennial anniversary of 
the charter of the Town of Barrington, New 
Hampshire. Founded in 1722, Barrington was 
named for Samuel Shute of Barrington Hall, 
the colonial governor of both Massachusetts 
and New Hampshire. This small town has con-
tributed to our ever-growing nation since be-
fore its independence. 
Hard-work and family are what has kept 
Barrington strong throughout the centuries. 
From its lakes and trails to its family-owned 
businesses, Barrington is an example of what 
the American Dream looks like for so many 
Granite Staters. This town of more than 9,000 
has become a pillar of Strafford County and 
will continue to be for generations to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Barrington on this in-
credible milestone. I look forward to a contin-
ued partnership with Barrington and its resi-
dents who I am proud to represent in Con-
gress.

their final album ‘‘Let It Be’’ just before the 
band broke up, the legal voting age in the 
U.S. was lowered from 21 to 18, and it was 
the year that William ‘‘Andy’’ Thompson first 
answered the call to serve his community. 
After 52 years and 13 consecutive four-year 
terms, Andy ends his tenure as Ohio’s long-
est-serving township trustee. Located in north-
west Delaware County, Thompson Township, 
which carries the same family name only by 
coincidence, has a population of just 659 resi-
dents. 
For township trustees in rural Ohio, the role 
requires more than just setting policy and ad-
dressing the concerns of residents. Given the 
size and budgets of smaller townships, the job 
often doubles as a part-time maintenance po-
sition of sorts. Even at age 84, Andy was no 
exception. On any given day, if Andy wasn’t 
tending to his own farm, he could likely be 
found patching roads or mowing at the local 
cemetery. 
Among Andy’s long list of accomplishments 
spanning his more than five decades of public 
service was the construction of a new town-
ship hall, at no added expense to taxpayers. 
While Andy’s time as an officeholder has 
ended, his legacy will endure for many years 
to come. This legacy includes his successor 
as township trustee, his son, Andy Thompson 
III. 
Andy has set a high bar for the thousands 
of 
township 
officeholders 
serving 
across 
Ohio’s 1,308 townships. It is an honor to rec-
ognize his long career of public service and to 
express my sincere gratitude to William 
‘‘Andy’’ Thompson on behalf of Ohio’s 12th 
Congressional District.

CONGRATULATING GENESEO HIGH 
SCHOOL 
PRINCIPAL 
TRAVIS 
MACKEY 
ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM GENESEO CUSD NO. 228 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 11, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Geneseo High School principal, 
Travis Mackey, who is retiring from Geneseo 
Community Unit School District No. 228 after 
nearly 20 years at the end of 2021/2022 
school year. 
Mr. Mackey has been an integral part of the 
fabric of the city of Geneseo since he arrived 
in 2001 after teaching math at Rock Island 
High School for nearly 8 years. Mr. Mackey’s 
first role with Geneseo High School was ath-
letic director, which he held for 16 years. In a 
city that is deeply passionate about their inter-
scholastic athletics, Mr. Mackey quickly be-
came a beloved figure in the Geneseo Com-
munity. He further cultivated the strong city- 
wide culture around the High School’s sports 
teams and aided in making Maple Leafs sport-
ing events a proud tradition. His work ethic 
and vigilant stewardship earned him a pro-
motion in 2017, when he became principal of 
the High School. As the School’s lead admin-
istrator, he helped position our children for fu-
ture success, listened to their stories, offered 
advice, and strived to be a friendly face and 
voice to every student without reservation. 
It is because of compassionate and trail-
blazing leaders such as Travis Mackey that I 
am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally congratulate 
Mackey on his retirement from Geneseo Com-
munity Unit School District No. 228 and thank 
him for his nearly 20 years of service to the 
city of Geneseo.
