Let us pray. 
O God, most Holy, we are grateful

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
know many Senators will be speaking 
further on this floor about one of the 
most distinguished Senators, certainly, 
I have had the honor to serve with, and 
that is Bob Dole, the Senator from 
Kansas, a former majority leader. 
We will hear, as we should, of his 
bravery, courageous nature in World 
War II, how he overcame the horrific 
injuries received to go on to a life of 
service—continuous 
service 
for 
the 
State of Kansas. 
We have so many wonderful memo-
ries of him, how he and the Democratic 
leader would meet in person or by 
phone several times a day, the com-
ments they made about each other. 
You could always take his word. He 
never surprised me. That is the way he 
was. He was the way a Senator should 
be. He always kept his word. 
But I also think of the personal 
things. He went to Europe, to Italy, to 
represent President Ronald Reagan on 
D-Day. President Reagan was going to 
be in Normandy, and he asked Senator 
Dole to go over and represent him in 
Italy, and there would be several Con-
gressional Medal of Honor recipients on 
board the plane. 
I was honored that he wanted to 
make it a bipartisan trip, and he asked 
me and my wife Marcelle to join him 
on the trip to Italy. The reason I men-
tion the trip is that these Congres-
sional Medal of Honor recipients—all 
for enormous bravery. They, so typical 
of Congressional Medal of Honor recipi-
ents, did not brag about what they did. 
They were just so honored to talk to 
Senator Dole about what he did. 
Senator Dole tried to be very modest 
about his exploits. He talked to them 
about those exploits of theirs that 
brought about the receipt of the Con-
gressional Medal of Honor. He would

brush it off, but they would ask: Sen-
ator Dole, what about this and what 
about that? And all the way through, 
he was great, a sense of humor, self- 
deprecating. Everybody on that plane 
realized this was a true hero of that 
war. 
I will speak more later on, but he was 
a good friend. 
I was honored to join Senator Pat 
Roberts to speak about Senator Dole 
when he received the Congressional 
Gold Medal. I told him what an honor 
it was that he asked me to speak. Cer-
tainly, when I think back on my years 
here in the Senate, that is one of the 
highest honors I received, to have this 
man whom I admired, I liked, was my 
friend, to ask me to speak for him. I 
also felt that there were so many oth-
ers who were probably even far better 
prepared to speak for him. I felt the 
honor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, our country lost a great 
statesman, and many in this Chamber 
lost a dear former colleague. 
Senator Bob Dole, who represented 
Kansas in the Senate for 27 years and 
who served 3 years as Senate majority 
leader, passed away yesterday morning 
at the age of 98. 
Throughout his life, Bob Dole rede-
fined and elevated what it meant to be 
a public servant. He was born not to 
wealth but in poverty, a son of the 
Kansas heartland, who grew up beneath 
the shadow of the Great Depression. As 
a young man, Bob unblinkingly an-
swered the call to serve by enlisting in 
the Army during World War II, where 
he earned two Purple Hearts and a 
Bronze Star. 
After his election to the Senate, Sen-
ator Dole quickly won the admiration 
of his colleagues with his candor, his 
sharp wit, and his penchant for good- 
natured ribbing, but beneath all that 
was an unquenchable desire to get 
things done in this Chamber. 
While he frequently sparred with 
Democrats, 
some 
of 
his 
greatest 
achievements were bipartisan endeav-
ors, including his work to pass the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, legis-
lation to strengthen Social Security, 
and revamping Federal nutrition pro-
grams. Despite rising to the top ranks 
of his party, Senator Dole always kept 
close relationships with those on the 
other side of the aisle. 
Senator Dole exemplified the ‘‘great-
est generation.’’ While I never had the 
pleasure of serving in the Senate with 
him, I always admired his steadfast ad-
vocacy for veterans, for Americans 
with disabilities, and his love for his 
country. 
For the information of all, Senator 
Dole will lie in state this Thursday, 
under the Capitol Rotunda, where we 
will pay tribute to his life and to his 
legacy. 
I thank the Speaker and Leader 
MCCONNELL
in 
helping 
make 
this 
event’s ceremonies possible. 
For today, I join all my colleagues in 
mourning the loss of this great public 
servant, and I wish all of Senator 
Dole’s family my deepest condolences. 
REMEMBERING FRED HIATT 
Madam President, on another tragic 
note, we learned today of the passing of 
Fred Hiatt, the Washington Post’s 
long-time editorial page editor. He was 
a titan at the paper—and in jour-
nalism—for years. My heart goes out to 
his family and colleagues on their ter-
rible and sudden loss. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Now, Madam President, on a dif-
ferent matter, as we begin the first full 
week of December, there is much that 
the Senate must attend to before we 
reach the end of the year. 
First, Senate Democrats remain com-
mitted to taking up and passing Presi-
dent Biden’s Build Back Better Act be-
fore Christmas. As I outlined in a let-
ter to my caucus this morning, Senate 
Democrats have been working furi-
ously to clear the necessary steps to 
achieve this goal. As we all know, the 
reconciliation process is not an easy 
one. 
The reason this timeline is so impor-
tant is that this legislation is about 
lowering costs for American families. 
As we enter the winter months, Amer-
ican families deserve a little extra help 
in affording things like childcare and 
pre-K. They need help in lowering costs 
on things like prescription drugs and 
making healthcare more affordable, 
and families need to know that critical 
programs like the child tax credit will 
continue uninterrupted. This program 
has already done immense good for 
millions upon millions of families. 
Build Back Better will make sure these 
benefits stay in place. 
For these reasons, we are going to 
continue the process until Build Back 
Better is signed into law. This is ardu-
ous work. It takes time, precision, and 
a lot of pieces moving together. It has 
taken months of communication, nego-
tiation, and countless late nights and 
weekend workdays to bring us to this 
point. 
I want to thank my colleagues, their 
staff, and the Parliamentarian for dedi-
cating the full measure of their atten-
tion and talent toward this endeavor. 
We are close, and we will keep going 
until the job is done. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, on other Senate 
priorities, as we continue working on 
Build Back Better, Democrats will si-
multaneously address other year-end 
priorities as well. First, we will con-
tinue working, as necessary, to process 
President Biden’s nominations both to 
the Federal bench and to serve in key 
posts within his administration. 
On that front, today, we will begin 
consideration of a terrific nominee, 
Jessica Rosenworcel, tapped by Presi-
dent Biden to serve as Chair of the 
FCC. 
Ms. Rosenworcel has nearly a decade 
of experience already as an FCC Com-
missioner and will soon be the first- 
ever woman confirmed to serve as 
Chair, breaking another glass ceiling in 
our government. She has been a fierce 
advocate for closing the digital divide, 
for protecting net neutrality, and, 
when confirmed, Ms. Rosenworcel will 
oversee critical Federal programs that 
help 
low-income 
Americans 
secure 
internet access. 
There are other nominees to come 
this week. Regrettably, if our Repub-
lican colleagues continue their holds 
on various individuals, Senators should 
prepare for the possibility of late 
nights and votes on the weekend. The 
President deserves to have his team, 
and we will spend whatever time we 
need to ensure his nominees are con-
firmed. 
Finally, Democrats will also con-
tinue addressing other issues before the 
end of this year. We will keep working 
on finding a path forward on voting 
rights legislation, and there are many 
intense discussions going on in that 
area. We will also work to address the 
debt limit and preserve the full faith 
and credit of the United States. I want 
to thank Leader MCCONNELL for his co-
operation in that regard. 
And, this week, we also anticipate 
that we will be able to reach a final 
conference agreement on the NDAA. 
Congress has passed the annual Defense 
bill without fail for, roughly, 60 years, 
largely on a bipartisan basis. I expect 
this year will be no different. 
So there is a lot of work to do. It will 
likely take weekends and late nights to 
get it done, but we will continue forg-
ing ahead on behalf of the American 
people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
thank the distinguished leader for his 
words and his statement about our 
friend Bob Dole. I also agree with him 
in that we have to stay here and get 
this work done. 
Madam President, as someone who 
has observed the evolution of relations 
between the United States and Cuba 
for nearly 50 years, particularly since I 
first traveled there in 1999, I find the 
situation between our two countries 
today bewildering, tragic, and exas-
perating. 
Bewildering, because senior Adminis-
tration officials—who have publicly 
and privately acknowledged that the 
60-year policy of unilateral U.S. sanc-
tions, isolation, and threats has failed 
to achieve any of its objectives and in-
stead has hurt the Cuban people—have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8921 
December 6, 2021 
nevertheless adopted that same failed 
policy as their own. 
Tragic, 
because 
the 
policy 
has 
emboldened Cuba’s hard-liners who 
have cracked down even more on citi-
zens who dare to peacefully protest 
about shortages of food, medicine, and 
electricity, and against government re-
pression. And it has exacerbated the 
crisis that has engulfed the island due 
to the COVID pandemic and the gov-
ernment’s dysfunctional economic poli-
cies. 
Exasperating, because anyone who 
understands Cuba could have predicted 
what has happened since the Trump 
Administration reversed the Obama 
Administration’s policy of engagement 
and would have taken steps to mitigate 
it. Instead, the current policy is mak-
ing the situation even worse. 
For the past ten months, I have 
urged the White House to not repeat 
past mistakes when it comes to our re-
lations with Cuba’s government and 
the Cuban people and to pursue a pol-
icy based on our longterm national in-
terests. I deeply regret that has not yet 
happened. 
Instead, this administration’s policy, 
so far, has been dictated by a tiny but 
vocal constituency in this country that 
has always opposed U.S. engagement 
with Cuba. It is a policy that history 
has shown is doomed to fail. 
Currently, the United States and 
Cuba have diplomatic relations, but to 
what end? There is no meaningful di-
plomacy being conducted, and our Em-
bassy in Havana and Cuba’s Embassy in 
Washington are barely functioning. 
Consular operations have ceased. The 
dialogues we had with the Cuban Gov-
ernment on issues of mutual interest, 
from law enforcement to human rights 
to public health—dialogues the Trump 
Administration cut off—have not re-
sumed. How can this be in our national 
interest? 
While Cuba remains on the list of 
state sponsors of terrorism due to a 
last-minute, politically driven, vindic-
tive, and factually indefensible deci-
sion of the Trump administration, we 
continue to have diplomatic relations. 
Is this not irreconcilable? And what-
ever became of the administration’s re-
view of that deeply flawed designation 
which was promised months ago? 
Cultural, scientific, and educational 
exchanges have largely ended. This is 
neither justified nor in our national in-
terest. The COVID pandemic provided 
an obvious opportunity for cooperation 
between American and Cuban sci-
entists, but that opportunity, like so 
many others over the years, was squan-
dered due to politics, distrust, and 
spite. 
The U.S. Treasury Department con-
tinues 
to 
block 
remittances 
from 
Cuban Americans to their relatives on 
the island even though it is their 
money, 
not 
Treasury’s. 
Shouldn’t 
Cuban Americans have the right to de-
cide for themselves whether to send 
their own money to their relatives 
rather than having that decision dic-
tated by the White House? Remittances 
help Cubans be less dependent on the 
government, improve their standard of 
living, and provide the seed capital for 
Cuba’s growing private sector, which, 
today, 
comprises 
one-third 
of 
the 
Cuban workforce. 
The number of remittances siphoned 
off by the Cuban Government is a small 
fraction of what some have falsely 
claimed, and is no more than what 
other governments charge. Let’s base 
our policy on facts rather than on 
rumor and what plays well domesti-
cally. 
And Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida, 
is the only country besides North 
Korea where travel by Americans is se-
verely restricted despite our common 
history and cultural traditions. It is as 
ridiculous as it is self-defeating. 
The White House has repeatedly said 
that ‘‘democracy and human rights’’ 
are at the core of its policy toward 
Cuba. Those are aspirations—laudable 
aspirations—but they are not a policy. 
We all want to see a Cuba where polit-
ical freedom and fundamental rights, 
especially freedom of expression, are 
respected and where an independent ju-
diciary protects the right of due proc-
ess. Those rights are severely re-
stricted in Cuba today, as they are in 
many countries, including some recipi-
ents of hundreds of millions of dollars 
in U.S. aid. 
Where we disagree is on how best to 
support the Cuban people’s struggle to 
obtain those rights. 
I have asked, but I have no idea what 
the administration’s practical objec-
tives are in Cuba or how it proposes to 
achieve 
them. 
After 
being 
told 
6 
months ago that the State Department 
was conducting a review of its policy, 
we have yet to see any change from the 
policy it inherited from the Trump ad-
ministration a year ago. What hap-
pened to the review? What did it say? 
Several administration officials have 
justified the continuation of President 
Trump’s punishing sanctions because 
of the public protests in Cuba on July 
11. They say ‘‘everything changed’’ on 
July 11. 
Cuba is changing. Access to social 
media and cell phones has dramatically 
increased. Attitudes among the young-
er generation are changing. The Cuban 
Government is making historic, albeit 
hesitant, reforms to relax restrictions 
on 
private 
businesses. 
President 
Obama’s opening to Cuba, which lasted 
only 2 years was instrumental in help-
ing to bring about these changes. 
Rather than acknowledge the unprec-
edented progress during that short pe-
riod, those who defend a policy of sanc-
tions say Obama’ s policy of openness 
failed because Cuba remains a repres-
sive, one-party state. They completely 
ignore that the same was true for 50 
years before Obama and for the 5 years 
since Obama. When it comes to helping 
to bring positive changes to the people 
of Cuba, President Obama wins hand 
down. 
But, today, the United States is, once 
again, on the sidelines, clinging to an 
outdated policy that history has shown 
will not succeed. In fact, it is having 
the opposite effect by denying opportu-
nities to both Cubans and Americans. 
U.S. policy toward Cuba is replete 
with contradictions, hypocrisy, arro-
gance, and missed opportunities. Cuba 
is an impoverished country that poses 
no threat to the United States; yet we 
treat it as if it does largely because of 
our own actions. While we maintain an 
intricate web of unilateral sanctions 
that every nation in this hemisphere 
opposes, the Russians and Chinese are 
aggressively filling the vacuum as any-
one who visits Cuba today can readily 
see. 
Engaging with a government whose 
policies are anathema to our own does 
not bestow legitimacy on that govern-
ment’s leaders or acceptance of its re-
pressive policies. If that were the case, 
we should cease engaging not only with 
Cuba but with dozens of governments 
around the world, including several 
U.S. partners, Saudi Arabia and Egypt 
being obvious examples. 
We condemn the arbitrary arrests, 
sham trials, laws that criminalize civil 
society, and the mistreatment and im-
prisonment 
of 
political 
dissidents. 
These abuses are common to many 
countries, and we apply targeted sanc-
tions, and we restrict aid. But, for 
purely domestic political reasons, we 
continue to impose a vast web of 
sweeping sanctions against Cuba even 
when the administration knows they 
have not worked. 
I have said it many times: Our policy 
toward Cuba needs to be guided—first 
and foremost—by what is in our na-
tional interest, not by what is in the 
interest of a tiny domestic constitu-
ency and not by making demands that 
we know the Cubans won’t submit to. 
Engaging with Cuba affords U.S. dip-
lomats and American citizens the op-
portunity to build relationships with 
Cuban counterparts and identify issues 
of common interest on which to make 
progress. We saw that during the 
Obama administration despite some 
who could not bring themselves to 
admit it. 
Over time, that is how we can then 
begin to address the more difficult 
issues that divide us, knowing that it 
is the Cuban people, not the United 
States, who will ultimately determine 
their country’s future. 
This 
administration 
has 
had 
10 
months 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
con-
tinuing the failed Trump policy of try-
ing to bludgeon the Cuban authorities 
into submission can produce positive 
results. There is not a shred of evi-
dence that it can. It never has. Are we 
going to waste another year and an-
other after that? 
I hope not, but that is what will hap-
pen if the White House does not change 
course and show the kind of thoughtful 
leadership on Cuba that we saw during 
the Obama administration and that 
was welcomed by a large majority of 
the American people. As Einstein said 
and so many have repeated, ‘‘Insanity

is doing the same thing over and over 
and expecting different results.’’ This 
administration can do better. It needs 
to do better. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
it is hard to believe it has been 25 years 
since Senator Dole took leave of the 
Senate. It is even harder to believe he 
passed away this past weekend, not be-
cause it comes as a shock to say good-
bye to an elder statesman at age 98 but 
because our colleague was still so ener-
getic, so involved, and so forward-look-
ing right through to his final months. 
If you didn’t know Bob Dole, if you 
just read a summary of his impressive 
Senate career, his leadership tenure, 
his Presidential campaign, he might 
sound like a man of contrasts. 
On one hand, our friend from Kansas 
preached conservative values—personal 
responsibility and fiscal discipline—but 
this son of the Dust Bowl and wounded 
warrior was also laser-focused on car-
ing for the most vulnerable, notching 
landmark wins on subjects from food 
insecurity to veterans’ issues, to the 
rights of disabled Americans. 
On the one hand, Senator Dole took 
pride in our Republican Party. He rose 
to key roles that were necessarily 
somewhat partisan, first leading our 
Senate 
Republican 
conference 
for 
many years and then leading a Presi-
dential ticket. But he was also a con-
sensus-finding legislator, an honest 
broker with deep friendships and work-
ing relationships that spanned the 
aisle. 
On the one hand, our colleague was 
earnest, unironic, and somewhat seri-
ous—a true ‘‘greatest generation’’ mid-
westerner. But he also wielded a 
charming, disarming, and self-depre-
cating sense of humor, whether he was 
cracking one-liners, often at his own 
expense, or doing a joint appearance 
with his comic impersonator. 
Allow me just one example of Bob 
Dole’s comedic talent. 
In January of 1997, just after Presi-
dent Clinton had defeated Bob and won 
his reelection, the President graciously 
bestowed 
on 
Bob 
the 
Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
There they were, in mid-January, 
just 3 days before the day Bob had 
spent months hoping he would be inau-
gurated, but President Clinton would 
be reinaugurated instead. It was a gra-
cious gesture and a warm event all 
around. 
The time comes for Bob’s remarks. 
He walks up to the podium, looks 
around, and he begins: 
I, Robert J. Dole— 
The crowd is already cracking up. 
do solemnly swear— 
Then a theatrical pause. 
Oh, sorry. Wrong speech. 
Once the laughs began to die down, 
there came the self-deprecating punch 
line: 
[I thought] I would be here this historic 
week receiving something from the Presi-
dent . . . but I thought it would be the front 
door key. 
The thing is, there was no contradic-
tion in any of it, no paradox. Bob’s life 
and career were very, very consistent. 
The virtues and the values that led Bob 
Dole to raise his right hand, enlist in 
the Army, and fight bravely until he 
could not raise that hand any longer 
were the same virtues and values that 
compelled him to raise his left hand for 
a different oath in the Kansas State 
Capitol a few years later and then 
across the Rotunda in the U.S. House 
and then here in the Senate. 
The same virtues and values that 
animated Bob’s passionate, pointed 
speeches in the 1960s about a citizen’s 
duty animated his great empathy to-
ward those who needed help. 
With Bob Dole, what you saw was 
what you got, and from his comrades in 
the 10th Mountain Division to his con-
stituents in Kansas, to the whole Sen-
ate and the entire country, what we 
got was extraordinary. 
I cannot summarize in one speech the 
full life or legacy of our friend Bob 
Dole. There are the battlefield heroics, 
the hospital-bed friendships with fellow 
future Senators Phil Hart and ‘‘the 
best bridge player at Percy Jones Hos-
pital,’’ Dan Inouye. There is the policy 
legacy that endures to this day. These 
remembrances will take Congress this 
whole week, and they will occupy his-
torians for decades to come. 
Bob Dole had the same chief hero for 
his entire adult life: his fellow son of 
Kansas, a general, and then a Presi-
dent, Dwight Eisenhower. Bob didn’t 
just like Ike; he idolized him. In Sen-
ator Dole’s Senate farewell speech in 
1996, he saved the second-to-the-last 
quotation for his hero from Abilene, 
KS. 
He kept his foot personally on the 
gas pedal for the Eisenhower Memorial 
here in Washington well into his nine-
ties. He invoked and praised Ike con-
stantly throughout his career. 
One such occasion was in late 1979. 
An event was held at Eisenhower’s boy-
hood home, Presidential library, and 
the gravesite in Abilene on what would 
have been his 89th birthday. It so hap-
pened that only a couple of weeks later 
Mrs. Eisenhower would pass away and 
be laid to rest there as well. 
On that day, Senator Dole explained 
that America had gotten ‘‘lucky.’’ 
Why? Because ‘‘when we were thirsty 
for leadership, we turned to a man 
from Kansas, a genuine hero who em-
bodied in his own life the finest quali-
ties of the American people . . . a man 
from grassroots America, steeped in 
the traditions of neighborhood and pa-
triotism and service . . . a strong man 
who earned his strength in war yet 
never forgot the disease of poverty or 
the scourge of personal suffering.’’ 
Bob was always eloquent, and those 
lines of his certainly did describe Ike. 
But now that our friend’s 98 amazing 
years have come to a close, we can say 
with certainty that Eisenhower isn’t 
the only Kansan who meets those 
standards. Not only General Eisen-
hower but also 2LT Robert J. Dole was 
a genuine hero from Kansas who helped 
satisfy a nation’s thirst for leadership, 
who was steeped in homespun Amer-
ican values and proud of it, who fought 
with great courage and valor on the 
battlefield, and whose concern for the 
most vulnerable in our society came 
right with him into the halls of power. 
I mentioned that Eisenhower was 
Bob’s second-to-last quotation in his 
farewell remarks to the Senate, so I 
want to close today where he closed 25 
years ago. Musing on both his past and 
his future, our colleague’s final quote 
was from the midwestern poet Carl 
Sandburg: 
[Y]esterday is a wind gone down, a sun 
dropped in the west. I tell you there is noth-
ing in the world, only an ocean of tomor-
rows, a sky of tomorrows. 
Now, for our remarkable friend, the 
Sun of this world has set at last. But 
we pray in faith that he now beholds an 
even brighter light; that the endless 
ocean of tomorrows now stretches be-
fore him. 
The entire Senate sends our prayers 
to Elizabeth and Robin and to so many 
family, friends, and former staff of 
Senator 
Dole. 
The 
whole 
country 
stands with you, not only in grief but 
in gladness and thanksgiving, for al-
most a century that was lived so patri-
otically, so gratefully, and so well. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, now on a totally 
different matter, last week brought 
new information about Russia’s mili-
tary activities along its border with 
Ukraine. Heavily armed ground forces 
are mobilizing by the tens of thou-
sands. It is looking more and more like 
Vladimir Putin intends to redraw an-
other border by force. 
The escalation of Putin’s ongoing 
war against Ukraine is an immediate 
threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty and to 
the security of its people. But as al-
ways with Putin, it is also a test with 
much broader consequences. Can ag-
gressive powers violate sovereign coun-
tries 
without 
facing 
serious 
con-
sequence? 
Fellow authoritarians in Beijing and 
Tehran will be watching how the free 
world responds. And President Biden 
has an opportunity to set the tone 
when he speaks with Putin tomorrow. 
The stakes for the President’s call with 
Putin couldn’t be clearer. We know 
what happens when the United States 
fails to engage with Russia from a posi-
tion of strength. We know what weak-
ness and capitulation get us. 
Remember 
how 
President 
Obama 
treated arms control and European-

based missile defense as negotiable 
items that could be traded away in ex-
change for Moscow’s good will. Re-
member how he mocked Republicans— 
perhaps most notably our colleague 
Senator ROMNEY—who dared to suggest 
that we ought to take the threat of 
Russia seriously. Remember the cuts 
to defense spending. Remember the 
dithering over whether to provide 
meaningful 
capabilities 
to 
Ukraine 
when Putin first invaded and how use-
less our blankets and MREs were 
against Russian armor and Moscow- 
trained little green men. 
This weakness didn’t purchase a 
reset; it produced a more emboldened 
Russia, willing to engage in more re-
pression at home and more aggression 
abroad. 
And here we are today. Vladimir 
Putin is gearing up to escalate his vio-
lation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. And if 
the free world doesn’t object, there is 
no reason to assume he will stop there. 
So, tomorrow, President Biden has 
both the opportunity and the responsi-
bility to tell Russia and Ukraine and 
our allies in Europe that the United 
States cares about sovereign borders 
and will help its friends protect them. 
If the free world is serious, its leaders— 
first and foremost, the President of the 
United States—will leave Putin no 
room to doubt that Ukraine’s sov-
ereignty is inviolable. And, by exten-
sion, they will signal to Chairman Xi 
that similar prospecting in the Pacific 
will come with prohibitive costs. 
If our leaders do not defend a funda-
mental tenet of international order, we 
cannot be surprised by the chaos that 
will follow. So if President Biden is se-
rious, he will convince Germany’s new 
government 
to 
abandon 
the 
Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline and, instead, try to 
reduce its dependence on resources 
that enrich Putin and his cronies and 
give Moscow leverage over Europe. 
If the President intends to learn from 
the past and actually help Ukraine de-
fend itself, he should expeditiously pro-
vide weapon systems that will materi-
ally help Ukraine defend itself against 
air threats. 
Finally, for the United States to lead 
the world’s response to authoritarian 
aggression, I hope President Biden will 
call on our allies to do more to con-
tribute to our collective security. In 
Europe, NATO member states must 
treat their own military modernization 
as a top priority. And in the Indo-Pa-
cific, our friends in Taiwan and else-
where must commit the resources, 
training, and reforms needed to help 
them face down their own looming 
threats. 
Tomorrow’s call must mark a turn-
ing point for the Biden administra-
tion’s approach to major power com-
petition from one where words are 
pinned on hopes to one where its words 
are literally backed by strength. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
learned this morning about the passing 
of Senator Robert Dole. What an ex-
traordinary person he was. 
It was not my good fortune to serve 
with him in the U.S. Senate, but as a 
Member of the House of Representa-
tives, I knew his work. 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
I can remember when we enacted the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. Tom 
Harkin was our leader on the Demo-
cratic side. He had a member of his 
family who suffered a disability, and 
Tom was always sensitive to that. But 
Bob Dole’s leadership on the other side, 
from the Republican side, made a re-
markable difference because we knew 
that Bob Dole was not speaking about 
disability as some other person’s expe-
rience but, frankly, his own. 
I don’t know what measure of cour-
age Bob Dole showed before he served 
the United States in World War II, but 
we all knew that experience led him to 
a battleground injury, which he carried 
the rest of his life. It was amazing to 
me that he kept his public life so ac-
tive despite the limitations that he 
faced. His loss of use of one arm put 
him in a position where he was com-
promised in many ways every single 
day. Yet he soldiered on, literally, to 
serve his Nation, not only in the 
Armed Forces but also in the U.S. Sen-
ate to pass legislation, major legisla-
tion like the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act. It is remarkable that he lived 
as long as he did and faced the injuries 
that he did. 
I would say, Madam President, you 
know better than most what we are 
speaking of with Senator Dole’s con-
tribution to his country and the battle 
he continued to wager the rest of his 
life. 
I respect him so much and hope the 
Senate will just pause for a moment to 
not only reflect on him, Elizabeth 
Dole, and his family but also on the 
fact that his bipartisanship made the 
difference in the lives of ordinary 
Americans. He was willing to sit down 
with the party on the other side of the 
aisle, compromise, and be determined 
to get things done. Shouldn’t we do the 
same in his honor? I think we should. 
SCHOOL BOARD VIOLENCE 
Madam President, it was about 2 
months ago there was an uproar in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. Hardly a 
day would pass, hardly a Republican 
Senator would take the committee dais 
and speak and not raise their mock 
horror and outrage over a decision by 
the Department of Justice under Presi-
dent Biden to notify school boards and 
school board members and teachers 
across the United States that we would 
not tolerate violence against them for 
their public duties. 
Merrick Garland, as Attorney Gen-
eral, volunteered to work with State 
and local law enforcement to make cer-
tain that members of the school board, 
teachers, administrators—all of them— 
would be safe in the execution of their 
duties, and none of them should fear vi-
olence. 
You wouldn’t have believed the reac-
tion from the Republican side of the 
dais in the Judiciary Committee. They 
came in and said that this is just an ef-
fort by the Biden administration to 
suppress free speech, to stop people 
who show up at school board meetings 
from expressing themselves. Well, we 
repeated over and over again it wasn’t 
expression of speech we were worried 
about, it was violence and every form 
of it that the Department of Justice 
was responding to, they wouldn’t hear 
of it. They refused to acknowledge the 
very real reality across the United 
States, and even in our State of Illi-
nois, when it comes to violence against 
school board members. 
The Members of this Senate share 
something in common. At some point 
in our lives, we heard the call to public 
service. It may have come in the form 
of a law we wanted to change or a pas-
sion for serving our communities back 
home. But for some, the greatest call 
to public service is to help children, 
the desire to do what you can, inch by 
inch, day by day, to leave a better 
world for the kids. 
That is one of the reasons that Caro-
lyn Waibel, a mother from my home 
State of Illinois, decided to put her 
name on the ballot to run in a local 
school board election. She wanted to 
serve her community and advocate for 
the safety and well-being of every child 
in St. Charles, IL, a suburb near Chi-
cago. Sadly, Carolyn Waibel’s career as 
a public servant was cut short. And it 
is not because she had any change of 
heart. It was because she feared for her 
family’s safety. 
Trouble began last summer. Carolyn 
started receiving threatening emails 
because of her views on mask require-
ments and in-person learning. At first, 
she brushed them off and said she 
would ignore them. She figured harsh 
feedback was just part of being a public 
servant. But then she started receiving 
messages that read: ‘‘Your days are 
numbered.’’ 
This mother, school board member— 
a non-paying job—was having her life 
threatened. 
Then she started to receive other 
messages, and other events occurred. 
Soon enough, her personal information 
was spread out online, and her home 
became a target. Carolyn started dis-
covering dead rodents thrown in her 
driveway. At one point, a trespasser 
cut the wires on the air-conditioning 
unit to her home. 
Then came the final straw: Carolyn 
actually heard someone sneak onto her 
property, cut the cord to her refrig-
erator, and open the door to her laun-
dry room. 
Following months of harassment, 
Carolyn resigned from her district’s 
school board in October. In explaining 
her decision to one news outlet, she 
said: ‘‘I had to put the safety of myself 
and [my] family first.’’ 
She said: Even though I have re-
signed, I am still receiving threats. 
Carolyn is far from the only school 
official who has feared for her safety in

December 6, 2021 
recent months. I commend her situa-
tion to my Republican colleagues who 
were so critical of the Attorney Gen-
eral for even raising the possibility of 
violence against school board mem-
bers. 
All throughout the country, school 
board members, teachers, and other of-
ficials have reported harassment, in-
timidation, and even assaults. 
In Pennsylvania, one school board 
president received a deluge of threat-
ening emails, voice mails, and social 
media posts because of the district’s 
COVID policies. Some of the messages 
threatened 
her 
life, 
while 
others 
threatened to share her personal infor-
mation with the world. 
Down in Florida, a school board 
member received death threats because 
she chaperoned a parent-approved field 
trip to an LGBTQ-friendly restaurant. 
She received threatening letters and 
phone calls from all over the United 
States. 
In Ohio, a school board member re-
ceived a letter that read: ‘‘We’re com-
ing after you.’’ 
After she shared the letter online, a 
public school official in a neighboring 
district said the members of his board 
had received similar threats. 
The list goes on and on. Just type 
‘‘school board violence’’ into your fa-
vorite search engine and look for your-
self. 
These threats against school officials 
are widespread and serious. A recent 
report from EdWeek Research Center 
found that 60 percent of the principals 
and district leaders they surveyed said 
‘‘someone in their district had been 
verbally or physical threatened in the 
past year’’ because of the district’s re-
sponse to COVID–19. One in three of the 
officials surveyed said the school board 
members, even their nurses, had faced 
similar threats. 
Now, I understand the pandemic has 
caused great concern and confusion for 
parents, especially parents of young 
kids. It is a new challenge for all of us, 
and there are no simple or straight-
forward answers in keeping our schools 
open and safe. 
It is every parent’s right to voice 
their disagreements with the members 
of their school board. And it is only 
natural that at times, emotions may 
run high, that is part of open debate in 
a free society. But there is a dif-
ference—a clear difference—which we 
should never overlook between free 
speech and threats of violence. We need 
to be unequivocal in drawing that line. 
I salute the Attorney General for 
making it clear that he was willing to 
stand up and defend those school board 
members who were subjected to harass-
ment, intimidation, and even violence. 
These people work for no pay. Many of 
them are parents themselves. They are 
not part of some shadowy organization 
or conspiracy. They are our neighbors. 
They deserve to be safe, just as we all 
do. 
The unprecedented rise in threats 
against school board members and pub-
lic school officials should not be taken 
lightly or politicized. There have al-
ready been too many instances of offi-
cials being assaulted. Law enforcement 
agencies have a responsibility to take 
these reports seriously, and that is ex-
actly what the FBI is doing by track-
ing reports of violence and threats of 
violence against school officials. Keep-
ing track of those incidents and those 
involved in them will save lives. It will 
enable State and local law enforcement 
to develop tailored strategies to keep 
communities safe. 
As part of these efforts, Attorney 
General Garland issued a memo on Oc-
tober 4 encouraging Justice Depart-
ment officials to reach out to members 
of law enforcement to see if we could 
assist. This outreach is an integral 
part of the Department of Justice’s re-
sponsibility. I am thankful these con-
versations are underway. 
Instead 
of 
condemning 
violence, 
some of our Republican colleagues 
have been railing against the Justice 
Department for even suggesting there 
is a possibility. Why? Do they believe 
these incidents of violence and threats 
are acceptable, that they shouldn’t be 
taken seriously? I don’t believe that. 
During the pandemic, there has been 
a troubling and growing trend of vio-
lent behavior in all spheres of public 
life. Everyone from flight attendants 
to election workers and—yes—school 
board officials has been harassed and 
assaulted. 
More than four in five flight attend-
ants report they have had to deal with 
an unruly passenger during the first 
half of the year. As a frequent pas-
senger on airlines, I have heard the an-
nouncements they make to try to let 
people know how serious this issue is 
and that it is going to be taken seri-
ously. 
In a moment of danger, these work-
ers and public servants are vulnerable. 
That is why the Department of Justice 
has to do its job. 
Here in the Senate, we should be 
united as well in saying violence and 
the threat of violence have no place in 
public life, whether in a Federal build-
ing, on an airplane, or in a school 
board meeting in St. Charles, IL. When 
parents like Carolyn Waibel are har-
assed to the point of fearing for their 
family’s safety, we need to at least 
have the common sense and common 
courage to speak up. We need to sup-
port members of law enforcement who 
are doing everything they can to pro-
tect all of our families. Among our 
many freedoms as Americans is the 
freedom to live without fear. Let’s de-
fend that right together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to be here this afternoon to 
address my colleagues of the U.S. Sen-
ate, and it is an honor that you sit in 
the Chair as I do so, as I pay tribute to 
the Honorable Senator Bob Dole. 
I was in church on Sunday. I got out 
of church—it is Advent; Christians are 
preparing for Christmas—only to learn 
that during that church service, Bob 
Dole had died. It has been the topic of 
conversation by Kansans ever since— 
not that kind of curiosity conversation 
that sometimes you have when some-
one passes away but that deep respect, 
that concern, that care, that apprecia-
tion for a life well-lived. 
Senator Dole grew up down the road 
from where I grew up. I remember kind 
of the earliest conversation with my 
own dad about World War II experi-
ences was that Bina Dole, Bob Dole’s 
mother, as well as my grandmother 
were on party lines, and the conversa-
tion between my grandmother and Mrs. 
Dole was the terrible circumstance 
that her son Bob Dole had experienced 
in the battlefields of Italy. 
My dad, who served in World War II 
and served in northern Africa, Italy, 
was in the neighborhood, and the re-
quest of one neighbor to another, one 
party line participant to another: Do 
you think there is any way that Ray 
could find out how Bob is doing? 
So my earliest recollection, my ear-
liest understanding of the life of Bob 
Dole was as a soldier, a member of the 
Army, a person who served in World 
War II and was horrifically injured. My 
view is—and I don’t know this, but hav-
ing known Bob Dole and having seen 
the consequences of his life, what I 
think is true is that that experience, 
the near-death experience, the expecta-
tion not to survive, and the long road 
to recovery created in Bob Dole, in his 
mind 
and 
heart, 
a 
different 
cir-
cumstance and a different result than 
if that never happened. 
People talk about Bob Dole’s life as a 
Member of Congress. He was elected to 
the U.S. House of Representatives in 
1960. I was asked over the weekend: 
When did you meet Bob Dole? And I 
can’t remember the first instance, but 
he was my Congressman. I was engaged 
in Republican politics as a teenager, 
and Bob Dole was always there at 
every gathering. And so I grew up in 
politics around him, but never with 
the—other than the sense that this is 
somebody we really respect. 
In 1968, Congressman Bob Dole be-
came Senator Bob Dole and his life in 
this body and his life in the House of 
Representatives culminated in amazing 
achievements on the legislative battle-
field. 
But when people ask me, ‘‘What do 
you remember or what made Bob Dole 
Bob Dole?’’ my view is his service to 
America in World War II. I think it 
made him more aware of people who 
were struggling, people who had dis-
abilities. I think he saw the challenges 
that people from across the country 
faced as a result of their service. He 
saw the challenges that people in for-
eign countries experienced in World 
War II. 
And when we look at his legislative 
achievements, we often think—at least 
I think of three—Americans with Dis-
abilities Act; food aid—what I call the

S8925 
December 6, 2021 
Dole-McGovern bill, but many people 
call the McGovern-Dole bill that helps 
feed hungry people, particularly chil-
dren around the world—and his service 
to other veterans. 
His work on this floor resulted in 
many Americans and, in fact, many 
citizens of the world having a better 
shot at life. On my maiden speech on 
the Senate floor, I recognized the cir-
cumstance of me, now a U.S. Senator, 
serving in what we would call in Kan-
sas the Dole seat and the tremendous 
challenge that caused for me knowing 
that those footsteps—my feet would 
never fit in those shoes. I sit and work 
from the Dole desk. This drawer has 
his name sketched in it, and it is a re-
minder to me about those shoes left 
unfilled. 
When I get frustrated with this 
place—which is not infrequent—I will 
put on my running shoes and I will 
walk to the Lincoln Memorial. But in 
the last decade, that allows me not 
only to go by the Vietnam Wall and 
come back by the Korean War Memo-
rial, but now I can stop and pay my re-
spects at the World War II Memorial. 
That is only because Bob Dole cared 
about those he served with. 
Bob Dole demanded that there be a 
memorial to those who served in World 
War II. But he did more than demand, 
did more than insist. He helped plan it, 
he recruited volunteers, he raised the 
money. 
So today we have the chance—and I 
assume this week we will be at the 
World War II Memorial paying respects 
to all World War II veterans, but we 
will emphasize the service of Bob Dole 
who made that place to pay those re-
spects possible. 
I try to visit with every Honor Flight 
that comes to Washington, DC. And in 
the beginning days of that Honor 
Flight, almost everyone—perhaps ev-
eryone who came was a World War II 
veteran. My own dad got to see the me-
morial built in his honor because Bob 
Dole made it possible. My dad came 
here on an Honor Flight, and Bob Dole 
was there that day, just like he was at 
almost every circumstance in which 
veterans were coming to Washington, 
DC, particularly World War II veterans. 
Bob Dole didn’t stand there for the 
glory of his service. He stood there to 
thank others who served in that war. 
He was there not to take the podium, 
not to be the public official, but to be 
the fellow soldier who served. There 
are lots of things we can commend and 
express our gratitude for what Bob 
Dole did, but he saw honoring veterans 
as a lifetime responsibility and oppor-
tunity. 
It has only been a few years since 
veterans coming to the World War II 
Memorial didn’t get to shake the hand 
of Bob Dole. Finally, at the age of 96, 
95, it became physically impossible to 
do that. But he was there at every op-
portunity for as long as he could. 
He served 36 years in Congress, 79 of 
his 98 as a public servant and servant 
of the Nation in the military. And in 
addition to the legislative accomplish-
ments, he was a decent person. He ex-
hibited civility. He had warmth. And 
no elected official—no offense to my 
friend and colleague who knew Senator 
Dole so well, Senator Roberts, no of-
fense to Pat, but no one could compete 
with Bob Dole’s wit. 
My guess is, as an injured soldier 
spending months in a bed in a VA hos-
pital where, incidentally, he shared the 
hospital with Daniel Inouye, who was 
also gravely injured, and later these 
two soldiers who survived battle and 
rehabilitation became fast friends—one 
a Republican, one a Democrat. The Re-
publican-Democrat thing didn’t mean 
that much. It was the shared service, 
the sacrifice of these two World War II 
heroes that brought them together and 
maintained that friendship. 
Bob Dole exhibited that wit. In fact, 
I had so many people after Bob Dole’s 
1996 run for the Presidency—he ap-
peared on shows in the evening, late- 
night talk shows—I don’t know, hun-
dreds of times people would say: If I 
had only seen that side of Bob Dole, he 
probably 
would 
have 
been 
elected 
President. 
He had the capability of causing peo-
ple to smile, and it could take the edge 
out of a difficult circumstance because 
of his wit. 
We are going to spend some time 
honoring Senator Dole this week. I 
want to make certain that I use my op-
portunity that Kansans have given me 
to express on their behalf. Not every 
Kansan—in fact, not very many Kan-
sans will be in Washington, DC, and 
not many people will be able to have 
the public eye and ear to express their 
thoughts. But even this weekend and 
throughout the time that Bob Dole has 
been in office and the time that Bob 
Dole was no longer in office, Kansans 
have held him in the highest regard. 
They have appreciated his service. 
They respect him even in disagree-
ment. 
I have seen disagreements. I have 
been in rooms where Senator Dole was 
there. He voted for the bill that raised 
taxes on financial institutions and 
something to do with farmers, and they 
were there to complain. But Bob Dole 
had such stature that no one could 
complain very long about a vote he 
cast, especially when he explained that 
you can’t get everything you want 
here, but we can make things better if 
we give a little here to get a lot more 
there. A lesson—a lesson—for us today. 
On behalf of all Kansans, I express 
their care, their love, and their sym-
pathies and condolences to Senator 
Elizabeth Dole, his wife; to Robin, his 
daughter; to other family members, 
nieces and nephews. 
I also express my condolences to all 
those who worked for Senator Dole in 
his office, whether it was his Kansas of-
fice or the office of the majority or mi-
nority leader. There are so many peo-
ple in Washington, DC, today—in fact, 
I looked to see how many U.S. Sen-
ators served with Bob Dole during his 
tenure here that still serve today. 
I heard Senator LEAHY on the floor 
earlier this afternoon; Senator GRASS-
LEY. Senator MCCONNELL, I heard him 
as well. Senator SHELBY, Senator FEIN-
STEIN, 
Senator 
MURRAY, 
Senator 
INHOFE, and Senator WYDEN all had the 
opportunity to serve with the Kansas 
Senator—the Senator from Kansas, 
Bob Dole. I can’t imagine that doesn’t 
influence the way they do their work 
and the way they look at the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
But to those who served in his office 
as members of his staff—and many of 
them have gone on through nomina-
tions and confirmations to become 
hugely important people in agencies, 
departments, and bureaus across this 
government—his mentorship lives on. 
Another legacy of Bob Dole is all the 
kids who were interns, all the young 
men and women who worked here for 
him, all the people who were influenced 
to have a little bit different approach 
to the rest of the world, a little bit dif-
ferent attitude toward people who they 
might disagree with, and a chance to 
bring the values that Bob Dole exhib-
ited in his public life to more people 
across the Nation. 
I don’t know how to sum up, but I as-
sume I will have a few more opportuni-
ties this week to express the life of Bob 
Dole, to express the value of the life of 
Bob Dole. This afternoon, it is not a 
conclusion, but it is an ending of these 
remarks. 
I thank Senator Dole for being a 
Kansan with a lot of common sense. I 
thank Senator Dole for his willingness 
to serve our Nation, put on the uni-
form, go through the terrible experi-
ence of his injuries and his rehabilita-
tion. I thank Kansans who helped him 
through that experience. 
Most of my life I heard the stories of 
Bob Dole’s hometown of Russell, KS. 
Again, I grew up within 15 miles of 
Russell. Upon his return from the VA 
hospital to his hometown, the commu-
nity rallied to his survival, his success, 
his rehabilitation. 
There is the story of cigar boxes in 
the drugstore where he worked as a 
soda jerk in high school. The business-
men and -women, the people, the farm-
ers and laborers, the workers put nick-
els and dimes, a few dollars here and 
there, into the cigar boxes around town 
to make sure that Bob Dole and his 
mom and dad had the resources to re-
cover. 
Maybe it takes us back to that value 
of coming from a small town where 
people know each other and care about 
each other; where on a party line, two 
worried mothers could have a conversa-
tion about their sons in service; where 
a community knows the importance of 
respecting and helping those in need. 
To the people of Russell and to the 
people across Kansas, thank you for 
the manner in which you have treated 
and respected a man worthy of our re-
spect. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Kansas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8926 
December 6, 2021 
Mr. MORAN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this week marks the 80th year since 
FDR delivered his ‘‘Day of Infamy’’ 
speech. That was in a joint session of 
Congress. FDR told the Nation that the 
United States of America was under at-
tack. Besides that attack, Pearl Harbor 
changed the course of history, includ-
ing the future and fortunes of a young 
man from Russell, KS. 
Today, I come to the floor with a 
heavy heart. I am here to pay tribute 
to my best friend in the U.S. Senate. 
Yesterday, Senator Dole passed away 
at 98 years of age. 
For 35 of those years, he served Kan-
sans here in Congress. He also was the 
second longest serving Senate Repub-
lican leader. When Iowans first elected 
me to serve in the Senate, Bob Dole 
took me under his wing. I couldn’t 
have asked for a better mentor. He 
treated me like a brother. Even when 
we disagreed, he treated me with re-
spect. We shared conservative, Mid-
western values. Those values steered us 
to champion fiscal discipline, Amer-
ican agriculture, rural healthcare, and 
limited government. 
From humble beginnings, the three- 
sport athlete at the University of Kan-
sas left his field of dreams. He left 
them behind to enlist and serve his 
country. Near the end of World War II, 
he was called to serve on the front 
lines in the northern mountains of 
Italy. 
From the Great Depression to the 
‘‘greatest generation,’’ Senator Dole 
was battle-tested to tackle whatever 
life threw at him. During his Presi-
dential campaigns, he got to know my 
State of Iowa very well, just like al-
most 
every 
Presidential 
candidate 
does. Bob loved my State of Iowa. He 
won the Iowa caucuses twice. In 1988 
and in 1996, I was proud to join him on 
the campaign trail and crisscross the 
State, visiting as many Iowans as pos-
sible in as many of our 99 counties as 
possible. I think he earned an honorary 
nickname as Iowa’s third Senator. 
On the campaign trail, it was often 
my job to introduce Bob Dole, so I am 
going to tell you about some of those 
introductions and about how, maybe, 
sometimes I screwed them up, but it 
was all with the intention of honoring 
my friend and fellow Senator, a person 
who I thought would make a very good 
President of the United States. 
So I would start out these meetings 
by telling the story about the day he 
nearly lost his life on the battlefield. I 
wanted to show how this young soldier 
from the Kansas prairie led a platoon 
of mountain troops to flush out the 
enemy—far, far afield from serving 
chocolate malts at Dawson’s Drug 
Store in Russell, KS. 
To illustrate his grit, his courage, 
and his resiliency, I explained how a 
then-21-year-old soldier belly-crawled 
across a mountain valley, under heavy 
artillery, to secure what I thought was 
Hill 15—or was it Hill 13? 
Then Bob Dole would chime in—kind 
of interrupt me—with some witty re-
mark. More often than not, I flubbed 
the name of that hill in my introduc-
tion of this Presidential candidate to 
the voters of Iowa. He patiently said to 
me that it was not Hill 15; it was Hill 
913. 
Humble through and through, he 
didn’t share that his injuries left him 
paralyzed from the neck down. Rather, 
he joked that I got the name of the hill 
wrong. He went on to say that what is 
important is that we are in the right 
State—meaning 
Iowa—at 
the 
right 
time, and right now. 
Senator Dole’s legacy was secured 
that day on the Italian mountainside. 
As Second Lieutenant of the 10th 
Mountain Division, as he pulled his 
radio operator to safety, Bob’s right 
shoulder was nearly blown away. The 
hit paralyzed him from the neck down. 
He waited for hours in the pouring 
rain, bleeding and in pain, before being 
carried down the mountain. 
Bob Dole was eventually sent home 
to Kansas in a body cast. He endured 
years of surgery, infections, rehabilita-
tion in his relentless pursuit to walk 
again, and he did walk again. He 
learned how to write with his left hand, 
his right arm remaining paralyzed. Bob 
never forgot the people who helped him 
along the way: a doctor in Chicago or 
the medical professionals in Italy. 
They made it possible for him to serve 
later on in elective office. 
Even though Senator Dole endured 
more than his share of hardship, it 
surely didn’t take away his sense of 
humor. Anybody who knew him knew 
that there was hardly a speech or a 
conversation in which something witty 
wasn’t said. He was a master of witty 
one-liners, and he could defuse red-hot 
partisanship with a single quip. 
As Republican Senate majority lead-
er, he finessed thorny policy issues 
with no-nonsense charm. He was able 
to find consensus with allies and adver-
saries alike. When Senator Dole be-
came chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee, he and House Speaker Tip 
O’Neill forged bipartisan consensus to 
rescue Social Security; and here we 
are, 35 years later, still rescued but 
still in need of some help. Less than 10 
years later, he helped to broker the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
of which my colleague from Iowa, Sen-
ator Harkin, played a very major role. 
His compassion for the disadvantaged 
informed his legislative achievements 
to expand Medicaid, school lunches, 
hospice, and food stamps. Senator Dole 
was awarded the World Food Prize in 
Des 
Moines 
with 
Senator 
George 
McGovern—a dual honor, that it was. 
That was the year 2008. They got this 
World Food Prize for their work to 
combat hunger, specifically nutrition 
for children in poverty. 
He never forgot from where he came, 
and his legislative record reflects his 
compassion for others. He was a com-
passionate conservative because of his 
instincts and because of who he was 
and not as a political gimmick. Sen-
ator Dole had an uncommon ability to 
make you feel like you were the most 
important person in the world. He was 
plain-spoken, not a smooth talker. His 
authenticity wasn’t manufactured. It 
pumped 
through 
his 
bloodstream, 
shaped by the hardships in the dust 
bowl and sacrifice as a war hero. 
His Midwestern instincts guided his 
decision on one crucial factor here in 
the Senate—the looming deadlines. He 
knew when to fish or cut bait. Senator 
Dole mastered the art of compromise, 
embracing transparency and banked 
trust and the respect of supporters and 
opponents alike. 
Senator Dole knew what it took to 
make the Senate work. We all know 
that it is not so very easy to make the 
Senate work. One former majority 
leader referred to the job as majority 
leader as a job of ‘‘herding cats.’’ 
Leader Dole was effective because he 
was exceptionally skilled at figuring 
out what each side needed to claim vic-
tory. You can’t be an effective leader if 
you don’t have followers, and Dole had 
lots of them. He was a war hero and a 
workhorse rolled into one; a soldier, a 
Senator, a statesman. He led the 10th 
Mountain Division to defeat tyranny 
and championed the 10th Amendment 
to uphold the blessings of freedom and 
liberty. 
When Senator Dole stepped away 
from public life, he didn’t stop public 
service. He poured his heart and soul 
into honoring veterans. He was instru-
mental in getting the National World 
War II Memorial established. For near-
ly two decades, he went there often to 
greet veterans at the memorial face-to- 
face, each time thanking them for 
their service and their sacrifice. 
Barbara and I extend our condolences 
to Elizabeth and the entire Dole fam-
ily. So many are grieving the loss of 
this extraordinary American here at 
home and also around the world. From 
his former colleagues to the corps of 
loyal staffers who worked with him 
here in the U.S. Senate, to legions of 
volunteers and supporters who worked 
for him on the campaign trail, Senator 
Dole was a widely respected leader on 
both sides of the aisle. 
Senator Dole referenced Scripture 
when he resigned from the Senate in 
1996 to hit the Presidential campaign 
trail at full speed. He said: 
To everything there is a season. 
A quarter-century has passed since 
he shared those very words with us 
here in this Chamber. 
Today, the time has come to say 
farewell to my mentor and brother in 
Christ, Robert Joseph Dole. The Lord 
has called him home as a loyal servant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8927 
December 6, 2021 
Until we meet again, enjoy the new 
balcony of Eternal Paradise. It has got 
a better view to keep watch over Wash-
ington and your beloved Sunflower 
State. 
It is fair to say that ‘‘Dole Beach’’ is 
now even closer to the Sun. 
May you enjoy the warm sunshine 
upon your face in life everlasting. And 
may the yoke of hardship born upon 
your shoulders, worn with grit and 
grace, weathered by ravages of time 
and war, be taken now by our Lord God 
and Savior. 
Always at the end of the day on the 
campaign trail, whether it was getting 
on an airplane to fly to the next stop 
or whether it was in a car going to the 
motel or a car going to a restaurant, 
we always heard Dole at the end of a 
day of maybe four or five campaign 
stops saying ‘‘Free at last. Free at 
last.’’ Well, Bob Dole now is free at 
last. 
Godspeed, my friend. You have made 
a difference in my life. You have made 
a difference in our country. Your serv-
ice and sacrifice will be celebrated for 
generations to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
know that we are expecting a vote 
shortly. I know the majority leader 
may come out and make some motions, 
and my colleague wants to speak so we 
are going to try to just move forward. 
I have sent my condolences to the 
Dole family and thank our colleague 
for his heartfelt comments this after-
noon. 
NOMINATION OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL 
Madam President, I rise to support 
President Biden’s nomination to the 
FCC of Jessica Rosenworcel to be the 
Chair of a new term of Commissioner of 
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion. 
In selecting her, President Biden has 
picked someone with great experience 
and with great knowledge of the FCC 
in a moment where we need tremen-
dous leadership. 
The FCC’s oversight and scope touch-
es just about every part of our domes-
tic economy and our lives. And we 
know that in an information age, it 
can be an exciting time of a lot of 
change but also of many real chal-
lenges. So know that this FCC Chair 
will be challenged. 
There will be lots of things for every 
household. From affordable to reli-
ability, to protecting consumers, to re-
storing an open and free internet, to 
driving new spectrum innovation pol-
icy, to safeguarding the public interest, 
there is a lot to do at the FCC. 
The policy decisions before the FCC 
are 
substantial, 
and 
Chairwoman 
Rosenworcel is committed to those pri-
orities and, as I said, immensely quali-
fied to lead at this critical moment. 
Before President Biden designated 
her to serve as Chair, Ms. Rosenworcel 
had spent nearly a decade at the FCC, 
and she knows how to get things done, 
furthering the Agency’s work on im-
portant issues of helping to narrow the 
digital divide. 
When the pandemic hit, we obviously 
had a new challenge facing us: How to 
get students connected, how to get 
healthcare connected, how to help peo-
ple living in disparity get access to af-
fordable broadband. 
For the Tribal community of one na-
tion, the Makah Nation—Madam Presi-
dent, I will yield to the majority leader 
for his motions. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the vote 
starts after the remarks that Senator 
CANTWELL is giving and Senator MAR-
KEY.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8928 
December 6, 2021 
I was mentioning the issues of dis-
parity across our country for those who 
don’t have access to broadband. The 
Makah Tribe, located on the northwest 
point of the Olympic Peninsula, 90 per-
cent of those households don’t have 
broadband. 
I know Ms. Rosenworcel committed 
to both Senator WICKER and myself she 
would work with us on the issue of 
broadband mapping. I know in one 
county in Mississippi, the home of my 
colleague, that it is estimated the FCC 
broadband 
mapping 
overestimates 
internet coverage by a whopping 80 per-
cent. This is unacceptable. We need ac-
curate mapping, and we need the 
broadband funding to move forward. 
I know the Biden administration un-
derstands the importance of afford-
ability of broadband. I know they want 
to deploy broadband and make it more 
affordable, and we want to work with 
them to make that happen. 
Chairwoman Rosenworcel also looked 
at the issue of healthcare and the fact 
that the internet is now access to doc-
tors, to medical information, to moni-
toring 
patients, 
to 
delivering 
healthcare, and keeping the lights on. 
This is also why I think her nomina-
tion is so important. 
She took time to firsthand visit tele-
health in Washington—the State of 
Washington—and Seattle and saw how 
we were pushing forward. Yet the FCC 
is going to do more in this particular 
area. 
Her leadership, I believe, will help 
ensure that our spectrum policies con-
tinue to spur innovation and economic 
prosperity. I know that she will be able 
to look forward to these developing 
technologies and how best to include 
innovation, including the next 5G wire-
less technology communications. 
All of this, I believe, means that we 
in the United States have a desire to 
keep pushing the envelope and to have 
an FCC that understands how to re-
solve these problems. 
I ask my colleague to support her 
nomination and to move forward on 
these important policies so we all can 
work on them together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I, 
as well as Senator CANTWELL, rise in 
support of Jessica Rosenworcel, Presi-
dent Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as 
the Chair of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission. 
In her time on the Commission, Chair 
Rosenworcel has been a tireless advo-
cate for consumers in today’s fast- 
changing media and digital landscape. 
She stands up for consumers. She 
stands up for competition. She stands 
up for children. That is what the job of 
Chair of the Federal Communications 
Commission is all about, is standing up 
for all of those core principles that our 
country believes in. 
She has made it very clear that she 
does believe that title II of the Com-
munications Act is something that can 
be and must be used in order to ensure 
that 
we 
give 
full 
protections 
to 
broadband users in our country. 
Now, more than ever, we need strong 
leadership at the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, as Senator CANT-
WELL was just speaking. 
We have 12 to 17 million children in 
the United States who did not have the 
internet during the first year of the 
COVID crisis, and we were able to build 
in huge funding that has reduced dra-
matically the number of children who 
do not have the internet at home, but 
more work must be done. 
The best way to do it is to add even 
more money into the Build Back Bet-
ter bill. If we do that, we will see that 
we are dealing with the fact that espe-
cially Black and Brown and immigrant 
children in our country have access to 
the tools which they are going to need 
to be able to get an education. 
The coronavirus is coming back. It is 
taking a U-turn, and its implications 
for the education of poor children in 
our country is dramatic. That is why 
Chair Rosenworcel is the right person 
at the right time in order to serve as 
the Chair of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission. 
We have to ensure the competition is 
at the heart of our policy. That is 
Chair Rosenworcel. We have to make 
sure the consumers benefit from these 
innovations in technology. That is her 
agenda. And we have to make sure that 
children—every child in our country— 
gets access to the technologies that are 
going to be necessary for every one of 
them to maximize their God-given 
abilities. 
That 
is 
what 
Chair 
Rosenworcel is all about. 
I recommend with the strongest pos-
sible voice that I have to have a very 
strong vote on the floor of the Senate 
to confirm her for the Federal Commu-
nications Commission. 
I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

VOTE ON ROSENWORCEL NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-

call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the nomination 
of Jessica Rosenworcel, of Connecticut, 
to be a Member of the Federal Commu-
nications Commission for a term of 
five years from July 1, 2020. (Re-

BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the Senate floor again this 
evening to talk about the so-called 
Build Back Better legislation. 
This is legislation that Democrats 
are trying to push through the process 
here on a purely partisan basis under 
what is called the reconciliation proc-
ess. 
I believe this massive tax-and-spend 
bill is irresponsible at a time when we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8929 
December 6, 2021 
see an uncertain economy, thanks in 
large measure to all of the challenges 
we are now finding with regard to 
COVID, and Omicron in particular, at a 
time of really high inflation that is 
hurting 
my 
constituents 
and 
everybody’s constituents in this Cham-
ber, and at a time of record levels of 
debt. Certainly, this is not a time for 
us to put out another piece of legisla-
tion that spends dramatically more 
money and also has big tax increases 
on the economy. 
This is the 10th consecutive week 
while Congress has been in session that 
I have come to the floor to talk about 
reasons I believe this legislation is bad 
for America. 
As we have talked about before, this 
massive new spending bill represents 
the largest amount of spending of any 
legislation ever passed by the U.S. Con-
gress. This is a big deal. 
Now, some would say: Well, the offi-
cial score is only $1.7 trillion so it is 
the second largest because the first 
largest would be the $1.9 trillion that 
was already spent earlier this year. 
That is fine. You can say that, but 
what sets this legislation apart, as a 
number of analysts have shown us, in-
cluding the Penn Wharton study, is 
that a lot of the spending in this bill, 
the costs of the bill, have sunsets. So it 
camouflages the full cost of the bill. 
I will give you an example of one of 
the major spending priorities that is 
going to end up costing a lot more than 
estimates say. The enhanced child tax 
credit from the March spending bill is 
extended for 1 year in this legislation, 
which means that after next year, this 
new benefit people have come to expect 
would be cut off. 
Based on the history here in Con-
gress, that is not how it operates. Ben-
efits like this are not ended. So if it 
doesn’t end, and these programs ended 
up not being sunset, Penn Wharton es-
timates that the total spending on this 
bill goes from around 1.75 trillion to 
about $41⁄2 trillion. Wow. More than 
double the largest spending bill ever 
considered by the U.S. Congress. 
At a time of record debts and defi-
cits, my hope would be that Democrats 
and the Biden administration have 
come up with a responsible way to pay 
for this multitrillion-dollar reconcili-
ation package. 
Unfortunately, some of us have been 
arguing for months that this legisla-
tion is about as far as responsibly paid 
for as you can get. One of the primary 
sources of proposed revenue is a series 
of tax hikes that, despite what Demo-
crats might say, hits the middle class, 
hits families in the middle class, hits 
small businesses the hardest. 
As an example, the proposed Medi-
care surcharge on active investment 
income is going to hit millions of small 
businesses that structured themselves 
as passthroughs with a new, across-the- 
board, 3.8-percent increase on all in-
come. 
Proposed corporate tax increases will 
hit American workers based on the 
analysis of the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office and the Joint 
Committee on Taxation. They say that 
when you increase the taxes on busi-
nesses, the main impact is to increase 
taxes on workers. 
Why? Because wages and benefits are 
reduced because of it. Costs will be 
passed down to working families. This 
means higher prices for everything. 
What is even worse is that, while the 
worker making 20, 40, 60,000 bucks a 
year is getting hit hard having to pay 
more because of inflation for gas, gro-
ceries, and clothes, at the same time, 
wealthy Americans, under this legisla-
tion, would get a tax break worth hun-
dreds of millions of dollars, thanks to 
the Democrats’ insistence on raising 
the cap on what is called the SALT, 
the State and local tax, deduction. 
As part of the tax cuts back in 2017, 
we decided to limit the deduction you 
could take for State and local taxes to 
$10,000 per year. 
Why? Because it was very expensive 
to have that deduction out there be-
cause it is progressive, helps wealthier 
Americans much more because it is an 
effective policy that leads to an incen-
tive where States are incentivized to 
raise their taxes because people get a 
corporate—a Federal tax deduction for 
it, and it is just not fair. 
My constituents in Ohio are sub-
sidizing New York and California for 
their high taxes. That doesn’t seem to 
make sense to people. 
However, under this Build Back Bet-
ter bill that was passed by the House, 
they raised that cap from $10,000 up to 
$80,000. Over the next 5 years alone, 
that provision would cost $285 billion. 
The vast majority of that tax benefit 
would go to the wealthiest Americans, 
with one recent analysis from the Tax 
Policy Center finding that almost no 
benefit will go to Americans not in the 
top 10 percent of income earners. 
Conversely, child tax credit expan-
sion, which Democrats argue was de-
signed to help lower and middle-income 
Americans, costs $185 billion. So $285 
billion for the SALT, which primarily 
goes to the wealthier individuals; 185 
billion is put in place for what is 
viewed as the cornerstone safety and 
social net program in this whole bill. 
So there are $100 billion more in the 
regressive tax cut than there is in this 
cornerstone social safety net program. 
As Marc Goldwein, with the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et, put it: 
We’re debating about whether to give 
lower- and middle-class families a thousand 
dollars more a year through the child tax 
credit, while giving upper-class families 
$10,000 or more through SALT. 
That is pretty accurate. 
Through lifting the SALT deduction 
and a number of other poorly planned 
tax overhauls under the so-called Build 
Back Better legislation, almost 70 per-
cent of people making $1 million or 
more a year—almost 70 percent of 
them—that is over 68 percent will get a 
significant tax cut. 
So if you make over a million bucks 
a year, 70 percent are going to get 
over—are going to get a significant tax 
cut. 
Nearly 90 percent of taxpayers earn-
ing between $500,000 and a million dol-
lars are going to get a significant tax 
cut. 
Contrast that to people who make 
30,000 bucks a year, as an example. 
While 70 percent of those making $1 
million or more are getting a tax cut, 
only 30 percent of those making 30,000 
bucks a year or more are going to get 
a tax cut. 
And guess what. That is in the first 
year. In the second year, it goes down 
to 12 percent. In the third year, it goes 
down to 10 percent or less, and then it 
goes to single digits. 
So if you make 30,000 bucks a year or 
more, you got really no significant 
benefit here at all. But if you make a 
lot of money, you get a huge benefit. 
That doesn’t make sense. 
For example, in California, where 
there are graduated income tax rates of 
over 10 percent—that is the State in-
come tax rate—that would amount to a 
$47,000 deduction, on average, for some-
body making 500,000 bucks a year—that 
is a lot—while the average taxpayer in 
California is only seeing a $20-per-year 
benefit. 
So, again, you are getting a deduc-
tion of about 47,000 bucks if you make 
over 500,000 bucks; whereas, the aver-
age taxpayer is only going to get about 
a $20-a-year benefit. This doesn’t make 
sense. It doesn’t make sense to Ameri-
cans as they learn more about this. 
The people I represent in my home 
State of Ohio are very concerned right 
now about the economy, particularly 
about 
inflation. 
They 
are 
worried 
about rising prices for everything, from 
gas to groceries. And they are worried 
about the fact that their hard-earned 
paychecks aren’t going as far as they 
did just a few months ago. 
Back in March, when the Democrats 
pushed through that $1.9 trillion spend-
ing package, many of us on this side of 
the aisle tried to warn them that this 
stimulus was not needed to get the 
economy moving. The economy was 
going ahead on its own at that time, 
and yet this stimulus was thrown into 
the economy, which we said would 
overheat the economy. And it wasn’t 
just Republicans. 
Larry Summers, who served as the 
Treasury Secretary for President Clin-
ton and Director of the National Eco-
nomic Council under President Obama, 
warned that injecting so much money 
into the demand side of the economy 
would lead to inflation. He was right. 
Now those same lawmakers are gear-
ing up to do it again. Not only does 
Build Back Better deal an unfair hand 
to the working families they claim to 
champion, giving a tax break to the 
wealthy and leaving other Americans 
struggling to get by, it will stoke more 
inflation by pumping more money into 
the demand side of the economy. That 
is not what we should be doing now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8930 
December 6, 2021 
Ultimately, the American people are 
going to have to look at this reconcili-
ation package—this bill called Build 
Back Better package—with its job-kill-
ing tax hikes, tax breaks to the 
wealthy, and stimulus spending and 
judge whether this is the right thing 
for the economy right now as we grap-
ple with high inflation and struggle to 
get out of this pandemic. 
It certainly is not the right thing. It 
is not in our national interest to be 
providing tax breaks to the wealthy 
and burdening our businesses and ev-
eryday taxpayers with higher taxes 
while stoking more inflation. 
We are dealing with a host of eco-
nomic challenges right now, from infla-
tion to supply chain delays, to Omi-
cron, to workforce shortages. As we 
seek to overcome these challenges, 
let’s not build back worse. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO ANN ‘‘ANDI’’ MATHIS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
stand today to extend my heartiest 
congratulations 
to 
Ann 
Mathis— 
‘‘Andi’’—as she prepares to retire from 
the National Endowment for the Arts— 
NEA—after 42 years of dedicated serv-
ice. 
A resident of Bethesda, MD, Andi has 
served as the NEA’s program specialist 
for States and regions, using her exper-
tise in arts management and best prac-
tices in grantmaking to support the 
work of 50 State arts agencies, six re-
gional arts organizations, and six U.S. 
Territories. 
Andi first joined the NEA after grad-
uating from Cornell University and 
then earning a master’s degree in com-
munity arts management from the 
University of Illinois Urbana-Cham-
paign. Andi began her career in the 
NEA’s Grants Office and Office of Man-
agement Analysis before settling into 
her role with States and regions in the 
Partnership Division. 
During 
her 
distinguished 
tenure, 
Andi has nurtured partnerships with 
State arts agencies and regional arts 
organizations, building a network that 
has extended the reach of Federal sup-
port for the arts. As a guiding force in 
the NEA’s Partnership Division and a 
font of institutional knowledge, Andi’s 
expertise, dedication, and sense of 
humor have made her a beloved icon in 
national arts funding. Often, State and 
local officials would line up, literally, 
to obtain Andi’s guidance and insight. 
Andi’s efforts have included exten-
sive work with both the Maryland Arts 
Council and Maryland’s Mid Atlantic 
Arts Foundation. She was also instru-
mental in centering the role of arts and 
culture in Federal disaster relief and 
recovery efforts, representing the NEA 
on disaster preparedness task forces 
and 
Federal 
Government 
working 
groups. Her outstanding work at the 
NEA has earned her numerous Distin-
guished Service Awards and other com-
mendations over the years. 
Andi’s greatest pleasure has always 
been her beautiful family. While at the 
NEA, she married, had two daughters, 
Allison and Melinda, and now delights 
in her daughters’ growing families, 
which 
enabled 
Andi 
to 
become 
‘‘Grandi.’’ 
A 
devoted 
mother 
and 
grandmother, Andi is renowned for her 
sewing prowess and her own line of 
‘‘Grandi’’ children’s clothing. 
After more than four decades in the 
Federal Government, Andi plans to 
continue her legacy of service in retire-
ment, working in the area of adult lit-
eracy, which will include tutoring 
through the Literacy Council of Mont-
gomery County. We know that she will 
take seriously the Jewish tradition of 
tikkun olam, repairing the world, as 
she continues to make a difference in 
the lives of others. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our gratitude to Andi Mathis 
for her outstanding service to our Na-
tion and in sending our best wishes to 
her as she begins her next adventure. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SEAN MCDONNELL 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I 
pay tribute to Coach Sean McDonnell, 
who recently announced his retirement 
after leading the University of New 
Hampshire football team for the past 23 
years. I am deeply grateful for his lead-
ership on and off the field and the im-
pact that he has made on countless 
students. 
Coach McDonnell has been a staple of 
UNH football for decades. After playing 
defensive back for the Wildcats from 
1975 to 1978, he later returned to serve 
as an assistant coach, before taking 
over as head coach in 1999. 
Under his leadership, the Wildcats 
saw much success. The team made 14 
consecutive appearances in the NCAA’s 
Football Championship Subdivision— 
FCS—playoffs 
and 
reached 
the 
semifinals in 2013 and 2014. As a result 
of his hard work, Coach McDonnell was 
named a two-time national coach of 
the year in the FCS. 
But his reach goes far beyond the 
scoreboard. Known as Coach Mac, he 
served as a mentor and role model for 
countless young people. Above all, he 
was deeply proud of how those students 
and players represented the University 
of New Hampshire and our entire 
State. 
Coach Sean McDonnell has left a 
lasting legacy in the Granite State. I 
thank him for all of his hard work and 
wish him the best in his well-deserved 
retirement.∑

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROYAL 
OAK, MICHIGAN 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the city of Royal Oak, MI. Situ-
ated in Oakland County, Royal Oak is 
a city endowed with natural beauty 
and rich traditions, built on a strong 
agricultural base and populated with 
dedicated citizens and entrepreneurs. 
The vibrant history of Royal Oak 
began in 1819, when it was explored by 
Michigan Governor Lewis Cass as part 
of his survey of the land that now com-
prises Oakland County. In contrast to 
the surrounding marshes, Royal Oak 
sat on lush, high ground. Near the 
intersection of the modern Crooks and 
Rochester Roads, Cass and his compan-
ions found an imposing oak tree that 
brought to mind the tale of England’s 
King Charles II, who was said to have 
taken refuge under a grand oak tree 
from enemy forces. For this reason, 
Cass and his fellow explorers chris-
tened the tree the ‘‘Royal Oak,’’ and 
the city received its name. 
Early settlers in the area were prin-
cipally farmers focused on clearing the 
land in order to build homes and plant 
crops. The introduction of the railroad 
into Metro Detroit and Michigan’s Bay 
area soon brought with it an increase

in Royal Oak’s manufacturing ven-
tures, including logging, milling, tex-
tile production, and more. The eco-
nomic growth of the area soon began 
attracting settlers from across the 
country, including the city’s first man-
ufacturer, Orson Starr, who became 
known for his production of cowbells. 
The boom in Michigan’s automotive 
manufacturing in the early twentieth 
century continued to bolster Royal’s 
Oak’s economic and population growth, 
and by 1921, the city claimed over 6,000 
residents and voted to be officially in-
corporated as a city. 
Today, Royal Oak is a diverse and vi-
brant city of over 57,000 residents who 
enjoy its beautiful parks, historic 
downtown, and thriving neighborhoods. 
Located in the Detroit metropolitan 
area, Royal Oak is home to a number 
of well-known local attractions, in-
cluding the Detroit Zoo, the Royal Oak 
Music Theatre, and the historic Royal 
Oak Farmer’s Market which has been 
in operation since 1927. The variety of 
shops, restaurants, and entertainment 
offered by downtown Royal Oak at-
tracts both local residents and visitors 
from across the State of Michigan 
alike. With its rich history, spirited 
downtown, and natural beauty, Royal 
Oak is recognized as one of the top 
places to live in the State of Michigan. 
The City of Royal Oak has been an 
integral part of the State of Michigan 
and our great Nation for over 100 years. 
As a Michigander and a resident of 
southeast Michigan, I am honored to 
ask my colleagues to join me in cele-
brating this significant milestone for 
the city, as well as its residents, elect-
ed officials, and businesses. I wish the 
city continued growth and prosperity 
in the years ahead.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8935 
December 6, 2021 
SENATE RESOLUTION 469—DESIG-
NATING DECEMBER 3, 2021, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
PHENYLKETONURIA 
AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. LEE (for himself, Ms. WARREN, 
and Ms. BALDWIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 469 
Whereas phenylketonuria (in this preamble 
referred to as ‘‘PKU’’) is a rare, inherited 
metabolic disorder that is characterized by 
the inability of the body to process the es-
sential amino acid phenylalanine and that 
causes intellectual disability and other neu-
rological problems, such as memory loss and 
mood disorders, when treatment is not start-
ed within the first few weeks of life; 
Whereas PKU is also referred to as 
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency; 
Whereas newborn screening for PKU was 
first initiated in the United States in 1963, 
became mandatory in most States in 1966, 
and was recommended for inclusion in State 
newborn screening programs under the New-
born Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 (Pub-
lic Law 110–204; 122 Stat. 705); 
Whereas approximately 1 out of every 
15,000 infants in the United States is born 
with PKU; 
Whereas PKU is treated with medical foods 
that limit phenylalanine; 
Whereas the 2012 Phenylketonuria Sci-
entific Review Conference affirmed the rec-
ommendation of lifelong dietary treatment 
for PKU made by the National Institutes of 
Health Consensus Development Conference 
Statement in 2000; 
Whereas, in 2014, the American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics and Genetic 
Metabolic Dieticians International published 
medical and dietary guidelines on the opti-
mal treatment of PKU; 
Whereas medical foods are necessary for 
children and adults living with PKU; 
Whereas adults with PKU who discontinue 
treatment are at risk for serious medical 
issues, such as depression, impulse control 
disorder, phobias, tremors, and pareses; 
Whereas women with PKU must maintain 
strict metabolic control before and during 
pregnancy to prevent fetal damage; 
Whereas children born from untreated 
mothers with PKU may have a condition 
known as ‘‘maternal phenylketonuria syn-
drome’’, which can cause small brains, intel-
lectual disabilities, birth defects of the 
heart, and low birth weights; 
Whereas, although there is no cure for 
PKU, treatment involving medical foods, 
medications, 
and 
restriction 
of 
phenylalanine intake can prevent progres-
sive, irreversible brain damage; 
Whereas access to medical foods varies 
across the United States and the long-term 
costs associated with caring for untreated 
children and adults with PKU have a sub-
stantial financial impact on families, indi-
viduals, and society; 
Whereas access to medical foods can pre-
vent detrimental effects on individuals with 
PKU, their families, and society; 
Whereas scientists and researchers are 
hopeful that breakthroughs in PKU research 
will be forthcoming; 
Whereas researchers across the United 
States are conducting important projects in-
volving PKU; and 
Whereas the Senate is an institution that 
can raise awareness of PKU among the gen-
eral public and the medical community: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates December 3, 2021, as ‘‘Na-
tional Phenylketonuria Awareness Day’’; 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to become more informed about 
phenylketonuria and the role of medical 
foods in treating phenylketonuria; and 
(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of 
this resolution to the National PKU Alli-
ance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to 
improving the lives of individuals with 
phenylketonuria.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 470 
Whereas Robert ‘‘Bob’’ J. Dole (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘Bob Dole’’) was born in 
Russell, Kansas; 
Whereas Bob Dole enlisted in the United 
States Army while he was a student at the 
University of Kansas, served in World War II, 
was seriously wounded attempting to save a 
fellow soldier during a military offensive in 
Italy, and was awarded 2 Purple Hearts and 
a Bronze Star with an Oak Cluster for his 
service; 
Whereas Bob Dole continued his public 
service by serving in the Kansas State House 
of Representatives from 1951 to 1953, and he 
was then elected to the United States House 
of Representatives in 1961, where he served 
until 1969; 
Whereas Bob Dole began his United States 
Senate career in 1969, which would last until 
1996, serving during this period as Chairman 
of the Republican National Committee, Sen-
ate Minority Leader, and Senate Majority 
Leader; 
Whereas Bob Dole was a life-long advocate 
for the disabled and was instrumental in the 
passing of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act in 1990 and the Dole-McGovern Food for 
Education program; 
Whereas Bob Dole was the Republican 
nominee for the Presidency of the United 
States in 1996; 
Whereas Bob Dole has been recognized by 
several presidents for his public service, in-
cluding President Reagan awarding him the 
Presidential Citizens Medal in 1989 and Presi-
dent Clinton bestowing upon him the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom in 1997; 
Whereas Bob Dole left elected office but re-
mained in public service, serving as— 
(1) National Chairman of the World War II 
Memorial Campaign; 
(2) co-chair of the Families of Freedom 
Scholarship Fund for families of victims of 
the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; 
(3) co-chair of the President’s Commission 
on Care for America’s Returning Wounded 
Warriors in 2007; and 
(4) Finance Chairman of the Campaign for 
the National Eisenhower Memorial; 
Whereas Bob Dole’s bond with veterans re-
mained unbroken, and he rarely missed an 
opportunity to greet veterans during their 
Honor Flights to the World War II Memorial, 
personally thanking each of them for their 
service; and 
Whereas Bob Dole exemplified the Amer-
ican spirit of service and leadership: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, that— 
(1) the Senate has heard with profound sor-
row and deep regret the announcement of the 
death of the Honorable Robert ‘‘Bob’’ J. 
Dole, former United States Senator for the 
State of Kansas;
