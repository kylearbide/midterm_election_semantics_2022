RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The majority leader is rec-
ognized. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
on Build Back Better, Democrats con-
tinue their work this week to iron out 
the details of our Build Back Better 
agenda—a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to rebuild ladders for working 
families to reach the middle class, to 
help people stay in the middle class 
who are already there, and to secure 
another century of American pros-
perity. 
Last night, I held another round of 
extensive talks with top officials from 
the White House, with the Speaker, 
and with my Senate colleagues. We 
made good progress, and we continue 
our talks later this week. There is 
more work to do, so we are going to 
keep at it. We are going to work at this 
every day until we can get it done. 
I want to thank my colleagues, the 
Speaker, and the White House for ev-
erything they are doing to finalize this 
important bill. It is a rare opportunity 
to do something big for the American 
people, and we will press ahead until 
we pass both a bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill and our Build Back Better 
agenda into law. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. President, now, on the debt ceil-
ing, last night, as you know, I filed clo-
ture on legislation sent to us by the 
House of Representatives that provides 
for a suspension of the debt ceiling 
until December of 2022. 
The Senate is going to hold that vote 
tomorrow, and, once again, Members of 
this body will face a choice: We can 
bring 
this 
Republican-manufactured 
debt ceiling crisis to a swift end or Re-
publicans can keep barreling our coun-
try ever closer to the first default in 
American history. 
By now, it is perfectly clear which 
political party is working to prevent a 
default on the debt and which party is 
deliberately and almost cynically root-
ing for one. Republicans have been of-
fered multiple opportunities to deesca-
late this crisis they have created. Yet, 
each time, the Republican leader has 
chosen to magnify it instead. 
Last week, Democrats offered a com-
monsense proposal that would have ad-
dressed the debt ceiling on a bipartisan 
basis; Republicans voted, instead, to 
default. 
Democrats then offered Republicans 
what the Republican leader said they 
have wanted by proposing a simple ma-
jority vote—exactly what happened in 
the early 2000s—and, again, Repub-
licans blocked it in favor of default. 
By now, it is clear that despite what 
they say, Republicans seem intent on 
seeing the United States miss out on 
its payment for the first time ever. 
They seem perfectly at ease telling the 
American people, including our Active 
military, our Social Security recipi-
ents, and all those who rely on Medi-
care, that they are unequivocally the 
party of default—the Republicans are 
unequivocally the party of default. And 
some of them seem to be proud of it. 
It is hard to believe that one of 
America’s two major parties would be 
willing to jeopardize our entire econ-
omy and irrevocably damage our stand-
ing throughout the world just because 
they don’t like that the party that won 
the election is following through on its 
agenda to help American families. But 
that is what is exactly going on here. 
Now, to be clear—let’s be very clear— 
tomorrow’s vote is simply a cloture 
vote. It is not a vote to raise the debt 
ceiling; it is, rather, a procedural step 
to let Democrats raise the debt ceiling

October 5, 2021 
on our own, just as Republicans have 
called for. 
Let me say that again so all my Re-
publican colleagues can hear it, and 
the American people can hear it loud 
and clear: Tomorrow’s vote is simply a 
cloture vote. Tomorrow’s vote is not a 
vote to raise the debt ceiling; it is, 
rather, a procedural step to let Demo-
crats raise the debt ceiling on our own. 
We are telling Republicans: We are 
not asking you to vote for it; just let 
us vote for it. And that is what you 
called for. That is what Leader MCCON-
NELL has called for on countless occa-
sions from July on. 
As recently as yesterday, the Repub-
lican leader pointed to episodes in 2004 
and 2006, while the majority raised the 
debt ceiling, while the minority voted 
against it. As happened then, the mi-
nority party can just get out of the 
way and let the majority supply the 
votes. 
Tomorrow’s vote, then, is a chance 
for Republican Senators to show that 
they don’t have to link arm-in-arm 
with those extreme Members of their 
conference running for President. They 
have a chance to show that they are 
still responsible. It is not too late, but 
it is getting dangerously close. 
As I said yesterday, this Chamber 
must send President Biden legislation 
to raise the debt ceiling before the end 
of the week. We do not have the luxury 
of using a drawn-out, convoluted, and 
risky process. We can resolve the debt 
ceiling crisis this week and reassure 
the world that the full faith and credit 
of the United States will never be in 
question. 
Democrats are going to do the re-
sponsible thing tomorrow and vote yes 
to prevent a default. 
There is still time—still time—for 
Republicans to get out of the way and 
allow this bill to pass with a simple 
majority vote. If Republicans want to 
vote no tomorrow, if they really want 
to be the party of default, that is their 
choice. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, now on voting rights, 
despite all we must do in the coming 
weeks, 
Senate 
Democrats 
remain 
strongly committed to advancing legis-
lation in this Chamber to protect the 
most precious right in our democracy: 
the right to vote. 
Later today, my friend the Senator 
from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, will in-
troduce the new John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. I am a co-
sponsor, and it is my intention in the 
coming weeks for the Senate to hold a 
vote on this bill. 
As a complement of the Freedom to 
Vote Act, Senator LEAHY’s bill restores 
some of the most critical safeguards of 
the original Voting Rights Act gutted 
by the Supreme Court’s conservative 
majority in 2013. 
Perhaps, most importantly, this pro-
posal would reinstate the so-called 
‘‘crown jewel’’ of the civil rights move-
ment: the VRA’s preclearance coverage 
formula, retailored for the 21st cen-
tury. It would also adopt new provi-
sions to address the next generation of 
suppressive voting already sprouting in 
States, unfortunately, across the coun-
try. 
Critically, this new bill also responds 
to the Court’s troubling ruling in the 
Brnovich case of earlier this year, a de-
cision which further weakened the 
VRA’s protections against State prac-
tices that hinder minorities seeking to 
vote. 
I will have more to say on this later, 
but, for now, I want to thank my col-
league from Vermont for his diligence 
and leadership in our fight to protect 
our democracy. 
The Senate must act soon if we are 
to successfully defeat the anti-democ-
racy forces of the far right. And we 
will; we will do just that. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
while the American people are battling 
inflation at its worst since 2008, Wash-
ington Democrats are behind closed 
doors, writing another reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree that would have the 
government borrow trillions upon tril-
lions more. While our economy still 
struggles to fully recover from last 
year’s COVID lockdowns, President 
Biden wants to slap Americans with 
the biggest tax hike in half a century. 
You know, it is really remarkable to 
watch senior, established leaders in the 
Democratic Party take their marching 
orders from the radical left. We are 
hearing claims and arguments that are 
absurd on their face as top Democrats 
try to wrestle with the positions they 
have literally been forced into. 
Yesterday, for example, President 
Biden’s Twitter account made the fol-
lowing two claims in the space of two 
sentences. First, the ‘‘Build Back Bet-
ter Agenda costs zero dollars.’’ And 
then in the next sentence: ‘‘We’re going 
to pay for it by ensuring those at the 
top and big corporations pay their fair 
share.’’ 
How amazing, Mr. President. It’s the 
first time in human history something 
can be totally free, yet, nevertheless, 
needs to be paid for. The Democrats’ 
socialist logic has become so advanced, 
they have transcended mathematics 
itself. 
Of course, the truth is that the 
Democrats’ massive tax hikes would 
not only hit the wealthy. It never 
works that way. There is no way to set 
up the kind of massive, never-ending 
new entitlements the Democrats want 
without coming hard—hard—after the 
middle class. 
Oh, and, sure enough, nonpartisan ex-
perts 
have 
already 
confirmed 
the 
Democrats’ reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree would hit the middle class 
and shatter President Biden’s promise 
of no new taxes for anybody earning 
less than $400,000 a year. 
But as my colleague, the junior Sen-
ator from South Carolina, has put it, 
as much as the reckless cost of their 
wish list would hurt Americans, the 
reckless content of the legislation may 
be even worse. Just look at what 
Democrats want to do to American 
families’ healthcare and prescription 
medicines. 
Last month, a new report from the 
Medicare trustees confirmed that the 
trust fund for Medicare Part A is on 
track to reach insolvency in just 5 
years—5 years from now. More than 54 
million American seniors rely on Medi-
care, and the promises we have already 
made are getting more and more ex-
pensive to keep. 
Last year, for example, for the first 
time ever, the amount the Federal 
Government spent on Medicare alone 
exceeded everything that we spent on 
our national defense. 
With Medicare 5 years from real fis-
cal problems, the last thing we need 
right now are politicians stretching the 
program even thinner, but that is ex-
actly what Democrats are doing behind 
closed doors at this very moment. 
Their reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree would heap hundreds of billions 
of dollars in new expenses and obliga-
tions onto the already troubled Medi-
care trust funds; hundreds of billions of 
dollars in new obligations for untested 
new programs, for big new pools of peo-
ple, all using the care seniors count on 
as the Democrats’ piggyback, with the 
program already on unsure footing. 
Even some of our colleagues on the 
Democratic side are calling this cra-
ziness what it is. As one of our col-
leagues said recently, we have to 
‘‘stabiliz[e] what we have, before we 
start going down this expensive [road]’’ 
or else it would be ‘‘fiscal insanity.’’ 
But that isn’t the only damage the 
Democrats’ bill would inflict on our 
health system. At the same time, they 
want to impose socialist price controls 
on the prescription medicines that 
Americans need. This is another exam-
ple of magical thinking: If we just pass 
a law saying something ought to be 
cheaper, it will be cheaper. 
But here in the real world, arbitrary 
price-setting 
on 
prescription 
drugs 
would cut down the private sector’s in-
centive to keep innovating. Expert re-
search shows Americans and the whole 
world would be left with fewer new 
drugs, fewer new treatments, and fewer 
new cures. 
Mr. President, this isn’t an abstract 
thing. This is a human cost. In the 
world Democrats want to create, some 
Americans would get sick and some 
would die who would have lived if new 
treatments had come into existence in-
stead of being squashed—squashed—by 
bad policy. 
One University of Chicago academic 
and past leader of the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers has calculated that 
over one decade, House Democrats’ pre-
scription price controls could rob our 
Nation of 15 to 20 times as many collec-
tive years of life as the entire COVID 
pandemic has stolen so far. 
Let me say that again. This expert 
believes that the Democratic war on

October 5, 2021 
prescription drug innovation could re-
sult in a total loss of American life 
that is 15 to 20 times that which COVID 
has caused thus far. 
In a serious world, any discussion of 
this terrible policy would stop right 
there. But Democrats need to slash our 
investment in treatments and cures be-
cause they need to cannibalize that 
money for other parts of their partisan 
wish list. 
It is the same reason Democrats are 
clinging to their absurd, new IRS spy-
ing provision that would let Big Broth-
er snoop on citizens’ transactions in 
excess of $600—another perfectly awful 
idea, but they need the money. 
These desperate cash grabs capture 
the essence of this partisan bill the 
Democrats are drafting behind closed 
doors—jeopardizing seniors’ Medicare 
funding, killing huge numbers of Amer-
icans indirectly by attacking new 
treatments and new cures. 
And for what? 
For a liberal hodgepodge of new enti-
tlement programs when we can’t even 
shore up the ones we already have. It is 
just a few more of the hundred ways 
this reckless taxing-and-spending spree 
would hurt the families of America. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
ANTI-CORRUPTION AND PUBLIC INTEGRITY ACT 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express concern about a cul-
ture of corruption among top officials 
at the Federal Reserve. 
Officials at the Federal Reserve are 
entrusted to make decisions that affect 
the global economy and touch the lives 
of every person in our country. These 
officials have access to private infor-
mation, often gathered at the expense 
and even by legislative mandate. There 
is no room for self-dealing by Federal 
officials. There is no room for even the 
appearance of self-dealing. Every mem-
ber of the Federal Reserve should know 
that without a reminder from Con-
gress. But, evidently, there is a prob-
lem at the Fed. We don’t know the 
scope of the problem or how long it has 
been going on, but a very disturbing 
picture is emerging. 
Last month, it was discovered that, 
during the economic turmoil of 2020, as 
the Fed was called on to take extraor-
dinary measures to support our econ-
omy, Robert Kaplan, President of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, made 
multiple 
million-dollar-plus 
stock 
trades. 
It was also disclosed that, in the 
same period, Eric Rosengren, President 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 
made multiple purchases and sales re-
lated to his stakes in real estate in-
vestment trusts and other securities. 
A new report last week revealed that 
a third key Fed official, Vice Chair 
Richard Clarida, also traded between $1 
million and $5 million out of a bond 
fund into stock funds exactly 1 day be-
fore Fed Chair Powell publicly sug-
gested possible policy actions that 
would significantly affect bonds and 
stocks. 
The Federal Reserve makes hugely 
consequential decisions—decisions in-
volving interest rates, trillions of dol-
lars’ worth of lending and debt, and the 
regulation and supervision of the bank-
ing and financial systems. The year 
2020 was particularly consequential, 
with the Fed taking unprecedented 
steps to backstop financial markets in 
response to the pandemic. To make 
these specific decisions, Fed officials 
needed access to vast quantities of pro-
prietary, nonpublic data and informa-
tion about individual firms, the state 
of the economy, and upcoming Fed ac-
tions. Under these circumstances, for 
Fed officials to actively trade in the 
market 
raises 
legitimate 
questions 
about conflicts of interest and insider 
trading. 
These Fed officials’ actions show, at 
a minimum, very bad judgment. They 
also suggest that some Fed officials be-
lieve that building up their own per-
sonal wealth is more important than 
strengthening the American people’s 
confidence in the Fed. 
In his years as Chair of the Fed, it is 
not clear why Mr. Powell did not take 
steps to prevent these activities. Sure-
ly, he understands that this kind of be-
havior by Fed officials corrodes the 
public trust in the Fed and that, in 
turn, such corrosion undermines the ef-
fectiveness of the Fed. 
Surely, he understands that the Fed 
officials’ trades run afoul of Agency 
guidelines, which state Fed officials 
should ‘‘avoid any dealings or other 
conduct that might convey even an ap-
pearance of conflict between their per-
sonal interests, the interests of the 
[Federal Reserve] System, and the pub-
lic interest.’’ 
Surely, he knows that, according to 
the Fed’s policies, its officials ‘‘have a 
special responsibility for maintaining 
the integrity, dignity, and reputation 
of 
the 
System. 
Accordingly, 
they 
should scrupulously avoid conduct that 
might in any way tend to embarrass 
the System.’’ 
Surely he is aware that the Fed’s 
policies instruct officials to ‘‘carefully 
adhere to the spirit, as well as the let-
ter, of the rules of ethical conduct,’’ 
and to ‘‘exemplify in their own conduct 
the high standards set forth in those 
rules.’’ 
As the sitting chair of the Federal 
Reserve, the responsibility to safe-
guard the integrity of the Federal Re-
serve rests squarely with him. Setting 
the right culture at the Fed and mak-
ing sure safeguards are in place to pre-
vent self-dealing and to protect the 
public’s confidence should be the min-
imum standard any Federal Reserve 
Chair should meet. And once there is a 
problem, a quick and aggressive re-
sponse is critical. Chair Powell has 
failed at both tasks. 
Last week, I said that I would not 
support Chair Powell’s renomination 
because in one decision after another, 
he has consistently failed to serve as 
an effective financial regulator. But 
that is not his only failure. 
Chair Powell has also failed as a lead-
er. Our Nation needs leaders who are 
willing to set aside and enforce strong 
ethics standards and who act swiftly 
when a problem arises. 
Our Nation does not need a go-along- 
to-get-along leader who doesn’t know 
or doesn’t care when, on his watch, 
people with great responsibility ad-
vance their own interests over the in-
terests of our Nation, or someone who 
drags his feet in dealing with problems 
that shake the public’s confidence in 
the institution he leads. 
We need changes at the Fed. I have 
already called on key Fed officials to 
voluntarily abide by stricter ethics 
standards. Yesterday, I asked the SEC 
to investigate these trades to deter-
mine whether these Fed officials may 
have broken laws on insider trading, 
and I will continue to push Chair Pow-
ell to vigorously enforce the ethics 
standards that already exist and to put 
stronger ethics standards in place at 
the Fed. 
In the last Congress, I introduced 
sweeping ethics legislation, the Anti- 
Corruption and Public Integrity Act. 
This legislation would ban all indi-
vidual stock ownership by Members of 
Congress, by Cabinet Secretaries, by 
senior congressional staff, by Federal 
judges, by White House staff, and by 
other Agency officials while in office. 
It would prohibit all government offi-
cials from holding or trading stock if 
its value might be influenced by their 
Agency, their department, or their ac-
tions. And it would require senior gov-
ernment officials and White House 
staff to divest from privately owned as-
sets that would present conflicts of in-
terest. This far-reaching legislation 
would also tighten conflict of interest 
and recusal requirements and shut the 
revolving door between industry and 
government. 
Now, look, this proposal won’t solve 
every problem. And for any officials 
who have engaged in illegal insider 
trading, we don’t need a new law to 
hold them accountable. But the pro-
posal would dramatically reduce the 
possibility for any appearance of im-
propriety at the Fed and at every other 
Federal Agency and in Congress and in 
the White House. 
I urge Congress to pass this legisla-
tion and to restore Americans’ trust in 
our elected leaders and the officials 
who make key decisions—key decisions 
not only about the economy, but about 
public health, the environment, and 
every other aspect of government. 
There is a lot of housekeeping we 
need to do, and the faster we start, the 
faster we get it done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks and that Senator 
BURR also be able to complete his re-
marks before the vote starts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RURAL AMERICA 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there are 
a few, quote-unquote, winners under 
Democrats’ $31⁄2 trillion tax-and-spend-
ing spree—unions, for example, and 
electric vehicle manufacturers. 
But there are a lot more losers, like 
middle-class families, who have to 
stretch their paychecks to cover higher 
inflation and higher energy bills; work-
ers, who will see jobs and opportunities 
shrink; and farmers and ranchers. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
home State of South Dakota, and so ag 
issues are pretty much always on my 
mind. And I am deeply concerned by 
what 
Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending 
spree will mean for South Dakota 
farmers. 
For starters, I am worried that the 
Democrats’ bill could mean the end of 
some farms, thanks to the bill’s expan-
sion of the death tax. 
Now, I have long crusaded against 
the death tax. Death should not be a 
taxable event, and there should be lim-
its on how many times the government 
can tax the same money over and over 
and over. 
But I get particularly fired up when 
talking about the death tax when it 
comes to farmers and ranchers, because 
the death tax can threaten the exist-
ence of family farms and ranches. 
You ask why. 
Because farming and ranching are 
often cash-poor operations. Farmers’ 
and ranchers’ money is tied up in their 
land, not the bank. So a farmer could 
have land worth as much as several 
million dollars and still struggle to 
break even in years where the harvest 
has been poor. 
So when that same farmer dies, the 
IRS will come in, demanding a substan-
tial portion of his or her estate. But 
since most of that money is tied up in 
the land, there is a good chance that 
the family will not have enough money 
in the bank to pay the IRS, and so they 
will have to start selling off the land— 
the lifeblood of their farming oper-
ation. 
So give that a couple of generations 
and the death tax can drive a family 
farm right out of existence. 
I am proud that the tax reform bill 
we passed in 2017 included death tax re-
lief. We successfully doubled the estate 
tax exemption, which lifted the specter 
of the death tax for most farmers and 
ranchers and helped reduce the need for 
costly estate planning efforts to try to 
keep the farm or ranch in the family. 
Unfortunately—unfortunately—we 
were not able to make this relief per-
manent, which is why I have continued 
to push for eliminating the death tax. 
But at least family farms and ranches 
were set to have relief through the 
year 2025. 
Well, not anymore. Democrats are 
set to return the death tax exemption 
to its pre-2017 level starting in Janu-
ary, which means that more family 
farms and ranches will once again be in 
the tax’s crosshairs. 
As I said, death should not be a tax-
able event. The IRS should not be com-
ing in to see you at the same time as 
the undertaker. But the government— 
and the government, I should say, 
should not be in the business of shut-
tering family farms and family busi-
nesses. 
But thanks to Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree, a lot of farmers are 
going to have to start worrying about 
whether they will be able to hand their 
farm on to their children or whether a 
government tax bill will mean the end 
of an enterprise the family has cul-
tivated, literally, for generations. 
The icing on the cake, of course, is 
that at the same time Democrats are 
planning to expand a tax that threat-
ens family farms, they are also plan-
ning to include tax relief for their mil-
lionaire contributors in blue States. 
That is right. Despite the fact that 
Democrats are scrambling for money 
to fund some of their spending spree, 
they are preparing to provide tax relief 
for wealthy Democrat donors. 
I am disturbed by the fact that 
Democrats are willing to jeopardize 
family farms and ranches to help fund 
their spending spree. But I am not all 
that surprised because it is clear from 
the bill that farmers and ranchers are 
not high on Democrats’ priority list. 
The bill’s spending on rail, for exam-
ple, emphasizes passenger rail, which 
will benefit Amtrak and a handful of 
east coast cities, but it means little to 
most Americans. 
The rail that matters to Americans 
in the heartland is freight rail, particu-
larly short line railroads, which carry 
farmers’ and ranchers’ corn and wheat 
and beef to markets around the United 
States. But short line rail gets short 
shrift in this bill. 
Biofuels also get short shrift. As this 
bill 
makes 
clear, 
Democrats 
have 
picked their preferred winner in the 
clean energy stakes, and that winner is 
electric vehicles. Biofuels take a back 
seat in Democrats’ legislation despite 
the essential role they played in mak-
ing American energy cleaner and de-
spite the significance of biofuels to the 
rural economy. 
Every few years, Congress passes a 
major farm bill. For decades, that leg-
islation has been the product of bipar-
tisan collaboration and a lengthy hear-
ing and fact-finding process that allows 
for extensive input from farmers and 
ranchers and other ag stakeholders. It 
is one of the last, I would say, truly bi-
partisan things that we regularly do 
around here. 
But Democrats have decided to use 
their tax-and-spending spree to cir-
cumvent the bipartisan farm bill proc-
ess. Democrats are extending farm pro-
grams without bipartisan input and 
without real involvement from many 
in the agricultural community. And, of 
course, they are not expanding all farm 
bill programs. 
They are not, for example, extending 
or providing money for the farm safety 
net. Instead, they are targeting money 
at programs that they feel will allow 
them to advance their climate agenda. 
Farmers are not Democrats’ main in-
terest when it comes to the agricul-
tural provisions in this bill. Demo-
crats’ climate agenda is the priority. 
If I am not here in Washington for 
Senate business, I can usually be found 
back home in South Dakota, where I 
spend a lot of time talking to farmers 
and ranchers. Most of them haven’t 
shown a lot of interest in tax breaks 
for union dues or electric vehicle tax 
credits. But I have heard from a lot of 
farmers and ranchers who are worried 
the Democrats’ proposed tax policies 
may threaten their livelihood. And, un-
fortunately, they are right to be wor-
ried. 
Speaker PELOSI suggested that this 
tax-and-spending 
spree 
was 
about 
Democrats’ values, but based on what 
we have seen, I am not too sure those 
values align with those of rural Ameri-
cans. 
Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending 
spree is a bad deal for rural America 
and for working families around the 
country, and I will continue to do ev-
erything I can to protect Americans 
from the dangers of Democrats’ social-
ist fantasies. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO VANESSA J. LE 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Vanessa Le, a 
dedicated member of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence staff, an in-
tegral part of the committee’s inves-
tigation into Russia’s interference in 
the 2016 U.S. elections, and my des-
ignee on the committee staff since 
March of 2019. While with the com-
mittee, Vanessa proved herself time 
and again to be more than just another 
capable lawyer. Although there is no 
debating her strengths as an attorney, 
it is—and I hope always will be— 
Vanessa’s courage in the face of cor-
ruption and expedience that distin-
guishes her counsel. As an unrelenting 
advocate for virtue, sensibility, and the 
common good, Vanessa lives the axiom, 
‘‘What is right is not always popular, 
and what is popular is not always 
right.’’ 
Vanessa’s work for the committee 
covered a waterfront of complex na-
tional security challenges that ranged 
from investigating Russia’s election in-
terference to conducting oversight of 
the U.S. counterintelligence apparatus. 
As lead investigative counsel for the 
majority on the Russia investigation, 
Vanessa worked tirelessly to secure 
witness interviews and document pro-
duction, draft and serve committee 
subpoenas, interview witnesses, and li-
aise with the Department of Justice,

the Office of Special Counsel, and the 
Senate legal counsel. In addition, she 
helped 
conduct 
witness 
interviews, 
drafted and reviewed chapters of the 
committee’s report, and provided cru-
cial legal advice on the committee’s 
constitutional and Senate procedural 
authorities. 
Vanessa was also responsible for 
overseeing the FBI and helping to actu-
alize my policy objectives relative to 
the Bureau and the Nation’s broader 
counterintelligence 
enterprise. 
Vanessa brought a keen mind, exacting 
questions, and a heartfelt passion for 
the role of the committee in keeping 
this Nation secure to work with her 
every day. 
Vanessa’s 
professional 
experience 
prior to joining the committee staff in-
cludes time as a litigation associate at 
the Drinker, Biddle & Reath law firm 
branch in Chicago, and as an Honors 
Attorney in the National Security 
Agency’s Office of General Counsel. 
Vanessa is leaving the committee staff 
to work for the Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence, where she will 
serve as a special advisor to the DNI. I 
can most assuredly say that our loss is 
Director Haines’ gain. Vanessa will 
achieve incredible things at the ODNI, 
and it is to the country’s benefit that 
her contributions to work with this in-
telligence community will continue. 
Although I am hopeful the transition 
will afford her more time with her hus-
band Gary and son George and baby 
girl Margaux, anyone who has ever met 
Vanessa will tell you that she is not 
really the relax-at-home type. I suspect 
she will bring the same intensity and 
‘‘let’s get this done’’ attitude that she 
was known for on the committee into 
her role at the DNI. 
Therefore, it is with a little reluc-
tance and a lot of pride that I wish 
Vanessa well and thank her for all she 
has done for the committee. Her wit, 
intellect, boundless energy, and unpar-
alleled mastery of the culinary arts 
will be impossible to replace. 
Thank you, Vanessa. The vital inves-
tigative work of this committee would 
not have been accomplished absent 
your dedication, your clear-minded 
judgment, and your unwavering moral 
compass. 
TRIBUTE TO NATE ADLER AND NICK BASCIANO 
Mr. President, I would be remiss, 
though, to close my comments about 
Vanessa’s departure from the com-
mittee without also acknowledging the 
departure of two other dedicated staff 
members. 
Nate 
Adler 
and 
Nick 
Basciano, currently serving on the ma-
jority staff of the committee, are leav-
ing the committee to pursue the next 
chapters in their professional lives. 
Nick and Nate have been valuable 
members of the committee staff, work-
ing critical portfolios covering, among 
other things, counterintelligence, for-
eign influence, and Asia, as well as 
serving as budget monitors to intel-
ligence Agencies. Their contributions 
to the committee and its work cannot 
be overstated, and much cannot be pub-
licly acknowledged. Their dedication 
to mission and their work ethic was a 
model for all, and their presence and 
counsel will be sorely missed. 
I wish them and Vanessa all the best 
in their future endeavors. I know that 
they are going to do great things, and 
I look forward to hearing and reading 
about those future accomplishments. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF LAUREN J. KING 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nomination of 
Lauren King to serve as U.S. District 
Court judge for the Western District of 
Washington in the Seattle courthouse. 
Ms. King is an immensely talented 
and experienced practitioner of the 
law, whom I had the honor of recom-
mending to the President for this posi-
tion, and I am proud to be advocating 
for her confirmation here today. 
Ms. King currently chairs Foster 
Garvey’s Native American Law Prac-
tice Group and has served as a pro tem 
appellate judge for the Northwest 
Intertribal Court System since 2013. 
She has served as a commissioner on 
the Washington State Gambling Com-
mission and taught Federal Indian law 
at Seattle University School of Law. 
Her qualifications are exemplary, and 
Ms. King’s confirmation will also be a 
historic one. She is a citizen of the 
Muscogee Nation, and she would be the 
first-ever Native American Federal 
judge in the history of my home State 
of Washington. 
Out of the 890 currently confirmed 
Federal judges, only 3 are Native 
American. Ms. King would become the 
fourth, and she would be the sixth-ever 
Native American judge in U.S. history. 
While this number is still too low, 
Ms. King’s confirmation will be an im-
portant step toward making sure the 
members of the Federal judiciary re-
flect the diversity of our Nation and 
have critical experience and insight 
into the unique relationship between 
our Federal Government and Native 
Tribes. 
This is especially important in Wash-
ington State, which for those who 
don’t know, is home to 29 federally rec-
ognized Indian Tribes.

So it is not just important but essen-
tial that our Federal judges understand 
the unique histories and perspectives of 
Native people and the legal principles 
that protect and preserve Native Amer-
ican standing under Federal law. 
I believe this is a perspective that 
matters and one that has been missing 
for far too long. With her experience in 
the Northwest Intertribal Court Sys-
tem and representing Tribes in private 
practice, Ms. King has a deep under-
standing of these principles and the 
legal issues that Tribes in Washington 
State face. And she has the support of 
major Native voices in the space. She 
has been strongly endorsed by the Na-
tional Native American Bar Associa-
tion, the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians, the Native American 
Rights Fund, and more. 
She has earned the support by being 
a sharp legal mind and a fair and just 
arbiter of the law. I firmly believe Ms. 
King has the experience, knowledge, 
and perspective required to serve on 
our Federal judiciary with distinction. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting her nomination. We can 
confirm highly qualified judges, and we 
can make sure our Federal bench re-
flects the diversity of the people it 
serves. 
And before I close, I also want to ac-
knowledge the two historic U.S. attor-
neys for Washington State who were 
confirmed last week. Nick Brown, of 
Seattle, is the first Black U.S. attor-
ney for the Western District of Wash-
ington, and Vanessa Waldref, of Spo-
kane, is the first U.S. attorney for the 
Eastern District of Washington. 
I know that both of these historic ap-
pointees have the experience needed to 
be successful, and I am confident they 
will work diligently to pursue justice 
for the people of my home State. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, on Au-
gust 7, I came to the Senate floor to 
oppose the expedited passage of what is 
known as the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. I did that for several reasons, in-
cluding because it was obviously going 
to be taken hostage and used by Demo-
crats to impose Big Government social-
ism on America. 
In those August 7 remarks, I said: 
I am frustrated with this legislation . . . 
because it is tied to . . . the Democrats’ real 
ambition, which is their multitrillion-dollar 
march to socialism that they will unveil 
right after this infrastructure legislation is 
passed. 
Democrats have admitted this . . . is 
[their] plan. 
They previewed phase 1 of this scheme in 
March, when they spent $1.9 trillion in the 
name of COVID relief. Of course, 90 percent 
of it had nothing to do with COVID. It was 
really just a payoff to their most loyal polit-
ical supporters. Sadly, it is now causing the 
highest inflation . . . in decades . . . [which] 
is a daily tax on every American who [is buy-
ing] goods and services. 
I went on to lay out phase 2, the step- 
by-step plan some Democrats are using 
to launch their Big Government social-
ism fantasy. 
Step 1, I said, was to change the con-
versation to trillions. Make billions 
look small. Condition the Congress. 
Condition the media. Condition people. 
That has happened. 
Step 2, I said, was to tell everyone 
that the United States needs infra-
structure. 
That has happened too. 
Step 3, I said, was to redefine the 
term ‘‘infrastructure’’ to include Big 
Government socialism programs. Real-
ly muddy it up so that no one could un-
derstand what they were actually talk-
ing about. 
That has happened. 
Step 4, I said, was that when more 
reasonable Democrats in the Senate 
balk at some of the more extensive or 
egregious items, promise them a two- 
track process: one for hard infrastruc-
ture and one for social programs. Con-
fuse the situation even further. 
That has happened. 
Step 5, I said, was to negotiate as 
much of the Democrats’ socialist wish 
list as possible into the infrastructure 
track. Then, put the rest of the wish 
list into the Big Government socialism 
wish list bill. 
That also has happened. 
Step 6, I said, was to pass the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill through the 
Senate as quickly as possible. The Tro-
jan horse would then be through the 
gates. 
Unfortunately, that has also hap-
pened. 
Step 7, I said, was to hold that infra-
structure bill hostage in the House of 
Representatives until everything they 
couldn’t get into the infrastructure 
bill—meaning the trillions of dollars in 
Big Government spending programs— 
also passes the Senate. 
That is what we are seeing happening 
right now, just as I predicted in early 
August. 
Step 8, I said, was for the President 
to say that he wouldn’t sign the infra-
structure bill into law if it is not ac-
companied by trillions of dollars in Big 
Government socialism programs. 
This has also happened. 
Step 9, I said, was to get the Big Gov-
ernment socialism part passed by cir-
cumventing the filibuster in the Sen-
ate. This would require abusing an ar-
cane loophole called reconciliation to 
pass trillions of dollars in Big Govern-
ment socialism with only 50 Democrat 
votes. 
Step 10, I said, was to give more mod-
erate Democrats political cover to sup-
port the parliamentary trick and Big 
Government socialism spending. To ac-
complish this, radical Democrats in the 
House are threatening to shoot the 
hostage—the hostage is the infrastruc-
ture bill that passed the Senate—a bill 
that more moderate Democrats more 
strongly support. 
These final two steps have not yet 
been executed because some Democrats 
see the peril in following the dangerous 
instincts of the most extreme elements 
of their party. 
On September 27, the most radical 
House Democrats, backed by Speaker 
PELOSI, stated that they were ‘‘com-
mitted to voting for the infrastructure 
bill only after [their Big Government 
socialism bill] is passed.’’ 
On September 29, one of the most 
outspoken of that group made it even 
clearer, saying: 
[S]everal months ago, we had an agree-
ment with . . . everybody else throughout 
the entire party . . . we will move forward 
on this $3.5 trillion. And we will link the 
[two bills, meaning the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill] and the [big government socialism 
bill]. 
In revealing this, she confirmed that 
the far left has been manipulating ev-
eryone involved in this process. 
When I laid out Democrats’ plans on 
the Senate floor back in August, I used 
the word ‘‘abracadabra’’ to illustrate 
the sleight of hand Democrats were at-
tempting to pull off, saying that the 
American people might not even no-
tice—until it is too late—that their 
wallet has been stolen and their coun-
try has been fundamentally changed. 
Fortunately, it seems the American 
people are wising up to the trick. The 
question I asked at the time—and the 
question the American people should 
be thinking about—is this: If all of 
these policies and all of the spending is 
so good, why does getting it done re-
quire a parliamentary house of mir-
rors? 
The answer to this question is that 
many Democrats know that the Big 
Government socialism bill is unpopu-
lar; it is bad for the country. Other-
wise, the hostage-taking wouldn’t be 
necessary. 
This radical dream of Big Govern-
ment socialism is stalled out at the 
moment. So, at Speaker PELOSI’s direc-
tion, President Biden drove up to Cap-
itol Hill on October 1 and, according to 
one Representative, told House Demo-
crats that in order to get the infra-
structure bill done, we have to get this 
agreement on the Big Government so-
cialism bill through the reconciliation. 
According to a House Democrat, the 
President said that he wanted ‘‘both 
bills to go at the same time’’ and spe-
cifically praised the far-left House 
Members who were ‘‘exuberant,’’ ac-
cording to a progressive congressional 
caucus member. 
In other words, the far left is in 
charge, and President Biden embraces 
that fact. His actions made clear that 
the infrastructure bill is merely a tool 
to pass this Big Government socialism 
legislation. Both must pass or neither 
will pass. Rather than use his platform 
to defuse the hostage situation, Presi-
dent Biden is egging on the hostage- 
taking, and he is demanding Big Gov-
ernment socialism as the ransom. 
Following President Biden’s meeting 
with 
House 
Democrats, 
POLITICO 
quoted a Democratic observer who 
said: 
The fact that the president came to the 
Hill and whipped against his own bill is the 
strangest thing I’ve ever seen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6903 
October 5, 2021 
It is very strange indeed, but it un-
derscores the sad reality that the far 
left is in charge of the Democratic 
Party. 
What we have witnessed these past 9 
months is the biggest bait-and-switch 
in American political history. The 
American people didn’t vote for Big 
Government socialism in 2020. Yet the 
Biden 
administration 
proudly 
pro-
claims that it is the most radically 
leftwing administration in American 
history. 
According to POLITICO this morn-
ing, President Biden held a call with 
progressive House Members yesterday 
in which he told them that he was 
‘‘getting more and more frustrated 
with moderate Democrats.’’ For what? 
For refusing to be steamrolled by an 
agenda that most Americans don’t 
want? 
Democrats’ 
extreme 
politics 
are 
eclipsed only by their incompetence, 
from Afghanistan to inflation, from 
our energy dependence to a border col-
lapse. Why? Because far-left radicals 
are dictating the agenda, and they are 
calling all the shots. 
With respect to this infrastructure 
hostage situation, the only question 
now is, Will every Democrat pay the 
ransom of Big Government socialism? 
And what is included in this ransom? 
First, Democrats are currently hag-
gling over the top-line cost. Will it be 
$3.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion, 
or something in between? Again, this is 
trillions of dollars—with a ‘‘t’’—that 
we are talking about. 
The number that they use is actually 
irrelevant because the bill will actu-
ally cost far more when you peel away 
the budget gimmicks. The overall cost 
of the bill is only labeled at $3.5 trillion 
because Democrats are pretending— 
again, for budget projection purposes— 
that many of these costly programs are 
simply temporary and they will termi-
nate in a few years. 
Ask any Democrat whether this bill 
just includes some temporary spend-
ing—spending that will soon phase out. 
Ask them this: How will they vote 
when it comes time to prevent the pro-
gram from expiring? You know this. 
Once you turn this sort of spending on, 
it will be next to impossible to turn it 
off. 
This is like valuing the cost of your 
home at the initial downpayment price 
and ignoring the 30-year mortgage that 
follows. 
Current estimates are that $3.5 tril-
lion really will be more like $5.5 tril-
lion, and that is just in the first decade 
alone. Yet all of Washington is cur-
rently obsessed with negotiations over 
where this phony number is going to 
land. This is another distraction. It is 
a tactic to divert your eyes from what 
is in the bill. No matter what number 
is used, the total cost of this bill is 
vastly higher than they claim, tens of 
trillions of dollars over my children’s 
and your children’s lifetime. That is 
before even accounting for inevitable 
cost overruns, waste, and program ex-
pansions. Of course, this means most of 
the Big Government socialism bill will 
be debt-financed because the bill will 
cost far more than projected even in 
the short run. 
Given our current debt of nearly $30 
trillion, allowing the fuse to continue 
to burn on this new, inflation-fueling, 
economy-crushing level of debt borders 
on insanity. It is the kind of thing that 
toppled world powers in the past. 
Now is the time to get our fiscal 
house in order or at least avoid making 
it worse. Democrats want to solve the 
problem of a burning house not by 
throwing water on it but by throwing 
on gasoline and arguing that 50 gallons 
of gasoline is, well, better than throw-
ing 100 gallons of gasoline on it. 
As obscene as Democrats’ spending 
has become, focusing on cost obscures 
the more insidious, destructive nature 
of Big Government socialism. 
Without careful oversight from the 
American people and their elected Rep-
resentatives here in Congress, govern-
ment bureaucracy can’t help but serve 
its own interests. Over time, the bu-
reaucracy has fed itself, becoming ever 
more powerful, ever more hungry, and 
ever more present in the lives of the 
American people. 
Many Democrats believe in feeding 
the bureaucratic beast. They want the 
government to grow, and they want 
Americans to be ever more dependent 
upon government from cradle to grave. 
They want permanent government con-
trol over childcare, over preschool, 
raising your children, over healthcare, 
over energy, jobs, employers, and the 
list goes on. This will mean that Amer-
icans must turn to Big Government for 
more and more of life’s necessities. 
Big Government will increasingly 
control the lives of Americans begin-
ning in their formative years. Once the 
Federal Government is in charge of 
funding preschool and daycare that has 
crowded out all the private competi-
tion, you better believe the Federal 
Government will be providing the les-
son plans for your children as well. 
This legislation will dramatically ex-
pand the welfare entitlement state, 
meaning they will provide even more 
incentives for American workers not to 
work. At a time when small businesses 
are desperately searching for workers, 
this is the wrong thing to do. It will 
fuel inflation; it will pile on more debt 
for our children and grandchildren; and 
it will drastically increase taxes and 
regulations on all Americans. More 
fundamentally and more sadly, it will 
move America closer to a European so-
cialist model where government de-
pendency 
replaces 
opportunity 
and 
where the dignity of work is lost. 
The strength of America is our 
unique system—our spirit, our work 
ethic, and our compassion for one an-
other. The foundation for all this has 
been the freedom to pursue our dreams 
thanks to the system of free market 
capitalism—a system that has spread 
the American dream across the globe. 
That dream spread because our country 
offered something different. 
This plan to spend tens of trillions of 
dollars fundamentally threatens the 
American system and the American 
dream, not only by jeopardizing our fis-
cal stability but by ushering in Big 
Government socialism, which, if his-
tory is any guide, tends to crowd out 
everything else and, perhaps, espe-
cially opportunity. 
The American people have proven 
that they will flourish if permitted to 
do so. In this sense, the only thing that 
can stop the American people is the 
size and the reach of the American 
Government. For the Senate to partici-
pate in imposing such self-inflicted 
wounds on our country would be pro-
foundly sad. History will not look 
kindly upon it. 
However, one point from my remarks 
this summer remains just as true 
today: 
It only takes one Democrat to end this in-
sanity, to stand up and say he or she won’t 
participate in this scheme. 
The American people and their chil-
dren and grandchildren will no doubt 
be grateful if one of them chooses to do 
so. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
NOMINATION OF PALOMA ADAMS-ALLEN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the nomination of Paloma Adams- 
Allen to be Deputy Administrator for 
Management and Resources for the 
United States Agency for International 
Development, USAID. 
Ms. Adams-Allen is a dedicated pub-
lic servant who has spent her entire ca-
reer focusing on international develop-
ment and eliminating global poverty. 
She will bring with her essential lead-
ership experience, stemming from her 
years as USAID’s Deputy Assistant Ad-
ministrator for the Latin America and 
Caribbean Bureau and, most recently, 
as the CEO of the Inter-American 
Foundation. 
She is exactly the type of leader 
USAID needs right now as Adminis-
trator Samantha Power aims to restore 
and refocus the Agency as a critical 
arm of U.S. foreign policy. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee 
reported 
Ms. 
Adam-Allen’s 
nomination by voice vote, with no 
Members asking to be recorded in op-
position. Yet she has been languishing 
on the Senate floor for more than 2 
months due to Republican holds. Even 
though the Biden administration has 
been in office for more than 9 months, 
the Senate is only now getting around

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6904 
October 5, 2021 
to voting on just the second nominee 
to USAID. 
Last week, I made a live unanimous 
consent request to confirm Ms. Adams- 
Allen and nine other nominees the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee re-
ported to the floor, including two other 
USAID nominees. But each of the 
nominations was blocked by our Re-
publican colleagues for reasons that 
have nothing to do with the nomina-
tions themselves. 
This continued obstruction of nomi-
nees who are critical to restoring U.S. 
global leadership and ensuring our na-
tional security is shameful. And it is 
dangerous. 
USAID is grappling with the impact 
of the COVID–19 pandemic and other 
humanitarian emergencies that are 
ravaging the globe, and Members of 
this body are preventing it from effec-
tively carrying out its mission, a mis-
sion that is intended to further U.S. in-
terests. 
So while I am relieved that the full 
Senate is finally taking steps to con-
firm Ms. Adams-Allen, the fact that we 
need votes on both cloture and final 
passage on a nominee who is without a 
hint of controversy, has served duti-
fully in government for decades, and 
was reported with unanimous support 
from 
the 
Foreign 
Relations 
Com-
mittee, is utterly absurd. 
The 
delays 
and 
obstacles 
facing 
nominees for critical development and 
national security posts pending on the 
Senate floor and in the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee is reckless and 
contrary to our country’s interests. We 
owe it to the Senate and the American 
people to fix this problem. 
I strongly support confirming Ms. 
Adams-Allen and respectfully urge my 
colleagues to join me in advancing her 
nomination, along with all of the for-
eign affairs nominations pending be-
fore this body. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6905 
October 5, 2021 
our bridges, clean water, broadband, 
transit systems, rail, and our electric 
grid. 
Chairman CARPER and I led a surface 
transportation reauthorization bill and 
a water infrastructure bill in our EPW 
Committee, both of which were unani-
mously reported out by our committee 
and really served as the backbone of 
this infrastructure package. The Com-
merce Committee and the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee both 
also contributed bipartisan bills to this 
major effort. A bipartisan group of our 
colleagues, led by Senator PORTMAN 
and Senator SINEMA, negotiated with 
the Biden administration to complete 
the package. That effort resulted in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, which earned the vote of 69 Sen-
ators nearly 2 months ago. President 
Biden himself expressed his support for 
the legislation in a widely covered 
speech from the White House. 
By now, that bill should be law and 
Federal funding should be on the way 
to State Departments of Transpor-
tation, local water boards, and our eco-
nomic 
development 
officials. 
All 
Speaker PELOSI had to do was put the 
Senate legislation on the floor in Au-
gust and watch its passage with a 
strong bipartisan vote. However, House 
Democrats broke promises to their own 
Members and refused to ask for a vote 
on the bill, and that was in September. 
Our bipartisan work in the Senate ad-
vanced the infrastructure football to 
the 1-yard line. We were there, but 
somehow House Democrats were still 
unable to reach the goal line. 
Last Friday, our Federal Surface 
Transportation 
Program 
lapsed— 
lapsed—for the first time in over a dec-
ade. After months of talking about re-
building 
American 
infrastructure, 
House Democrats shut down the Fed-
eral Highway Administration, pressing 
pause on some of the most important 
infrastructure programs in this coun-
try. It was a short lapse, but it was a 
lapse. A lapse in these programs would 
be unacceptable in any circumstance, 
but House Democrats decided to let the 
programs expire rather than vote on bi-
partisan legislation that sat on their 
desks for more than 7 weeks during 
their August recess. 
In delaying this vote, those leaders 
didn’t just break their commitment to 
the American people, but, again, they 
broke a commitment to their own 
Members when they said—they were 
originally promised the infrastructure 
bill would receive a vote by September 
27. Instead, the House and Senate had 
to reauthorize, quickly, our existing 
Surface Transportation Program, but 
guess what—for a month—October 31. 
What does that do? Not much. It does 
continue, but it does create confusion, 
and that stop-and-start is difficult. I 
appreciate my colleagues’ work to re-
open these programs, but it is not 
enough. 
Over on the House side, they are 
holding core infrastructure legislation 
hostage in an effort to force Members 
of their own party to come on board in 
separate legislation that would, in my 
opinion, waste $3.5 trillion on social 
programs unrelated to infrastructure. 
The $3.5 trillion package is what my 
colleague and our colleague, Senator 
MANCHIN, correctly described as ‘‘fiscal 
insanity.’’ House Democrats are telling 
the American people that if they want 
roads and bridges, they have to accept 
trillions of dollars in unrelated spend-
ing and unrelated tax policies. 
If 
this 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree were popular with the American 
people, they wouldn’t have to bind it to 
the 
infrastructure 
legislation 
and 
block that legislation in an effort to 
convince the Members of their own 
party to support it, but they under-
stand there is a real concern back 
home to spending $3.5 trillion. I heard 
this over and over when I was just 
home over the weekend—over and 
over—from my constituents in West 
Virginia. 
We all know inflation is real, and it 
is impacting day-to-day families—fam-
ilies who are trying to figure out how 
to pay for the cost of gasoline, that 
gallon of milk, those new school 
clothes, books, pencils, the cost of 
heating and cooling their homes. It is 
hurting our American families. And 
yet, even with these red flags, the 
Biden administration and my Demo-
crat colleagues want to spend an addi-
tional 3.5 trillion—with a ‘‘t’’—dollars. 
And if that is not enough, they want to 
impose the largest tax hike in decades. 
These efforts will hit American fami-
lies with higher prices and greater tax 
burdens at a time when they can least 
afford it. I am not sure there is a time 
we could ever afford it. So this makes 
zero sense. 
Now, I know President Biden has 
promised not to raise taxes on families 
making less than $400,000 a year. He 
has repeated this many, many times in 
his public speeches. But what he is not 
telling you is that the cost of everyday 
living is going up significantly because 
of these—and will go up more because 
of these progressive policies, which are 
a hidden tax on the American people. 
Your utility bills, your grocery bills, 
all the costs of everyday goods and 
services are going to go up. 
And have you heard this just really 
outrageous idea that they want your 
bank or credit union to tell the IRS 
every deposit or withdrawal of $600 or 
more? And if you have $600 in your 
bank account, they want your bank or 
credit union to report that to the IRS. 
Does that sound like it is designed to 
target 
billionaires 
or 
middle-class 
Americans? 
The taxes, fees, and penalties this 
partisan, 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
package includes ultimately still falls 
to you, regardless of how much you 
make. As ranking member of the EPW 
Committee, I am especially concerned 
about several environmental provisions 
in the $3.5 trillion spending plan. 
Let’s be clear. All of us, Republicans 
and Democrats, we do want a cleaner 
energy future, and we are moving to-
ward that. The proof of that is our 
work together on technologies like car-
bon capture and utilization. But this 
rushed reconciliation package doesn’t 
allow time for any sort of transition. 
Wind and solar energy still has serious 
gaps. They are growing, yes, but they 
still have serious gaps in reliability 
and stability. When the wind stops 
blowing and the Sun isn’t shining, our 
country still relies heavily on coal, 
natural gas, and nuclear. But instead 
of recognizing this reality and invest-
ing in technologies to accelerate car-
bon capture, which would lead to less 
emissions, this package punishes com-
panies that are already cutting their 
emissions. It is reckless spending. It is 
punitive taxation, and, ultimately, the 
American family will pay the price. 
Take, for example, the proposed 
methane tax—well, methane fee, it is 
called, but it is actually a natural gas 
tax. This regressive tax on natural gas 
would increase energy costs on Amer-
ican families and small businesses, dis-
proportionately affecting middle- and 
low-income households at a time when 
natural gas prices are going up due to 
inflation and increased demand and re-
duced supply here and abroad due to 
some factors—and, right now, the pan-
demic. 
According to the EPA, natural gas 
systems in the United States reduced 
their overall methane emissions by 
nearly 16 percent between 1990 and 2019, 
without these onerous regulations and 
taxes. It is widely recognized that the 
shale gas boom led to significant 
greenhouse gas emission reductions 
across our power sector. In fact, as our 
natural gas production has risen and 
has gone up, the country’s overall 
greenhouse gas emissions have gone 
down significantly. 
According to API, the methane fee, 
or tax, would cost approximately $9.1 
billion and as many as 90,000 jobs in a 
lot of the regions in the country, one of 
which is my own in West Virginia. 
Don’t be fooled. Like any other part of 
this package, the methane fee is rushed 
government overreach when the mar-
ket is already reducing emissions. 
More than 150 groups have written to 
Congress to oppose this natural gas 
tax. This is not about reducing emis-
sions or even raising revenues for 
Washington; it is about targeting an 
industry, oil and gas, and the related 
good-paying jobs, like those in West 
Virginia, for elimination for wholly po-
litical purposes. The idea that our 
country will be able to transition to a 
cleaner future and keep up with our en-
ergy demands without natural gas is 
just not based in reality. 
So speaking of based in reality, let’s 
talk about the proposed Clean Elec-
tricity Performance Program. This is a 
program in the $3.5 trillion bill to 
eliminate coal and natural gas from 
our electricity mix by requiring an 80- 
percent reduction in carbon emissions 
from utilities by 2030. This goal is very 
unrealistic as fossil fuels now provide

60 percent of our Nation’s electricity 
today, 2021. 
The United Mine Workers of America 
wrote that this plan would ‘‘eliminate 
virtually all of West Virginia’s coal 
generation 
fleet 
of 
eight 
baseload 
power plants well before the end of this 
decade. . . . All related coal mining 
and utility jobs would be lost, with se-
vere [adverse] impacts on families, 
communities, and the local and state 
tax revenues associated with mining, 
electric generation, and electric power 
[generation].’’ 
This program is an explicit attempt 
to put energy producers out of work. It 
would use taxpayer dollars to get rid of 
coal and natural gas jobs in States like 
mine, using a convoluted system to try 
to mask the hit to our electricity tax-
payers. And for all the promises we 
heard of lined-up green energy jobs for 
these workers to replace these jobs, I 
am certainly not seeing many of those 
in my State, certainly not the tens of 
thousands of jobs that would be needed 
to make up for the lost jobs. And I am 
definitely not seeing any of those green 
jobs pay—the pay on those green jobs 
even close to what a miner would make 
or somebody in the natural gas busi-
ness. 
But the Clean Electricity Perform-
ance Program will impact more than 
just my home State, of course. If Cali-
fornia is any indication, the clean elec-
tricity payment plan will lead to less 
reliability, rolling blackouts all across 
the country, and higher energy prices. 
We don’t need to wait and see how a 
plan like this will impact a powerhouse 
country like ours. 
Germany is already trying this. Ac-
cording to Forbes Magazine, our Ger-
man friends are spending as much as $4 
trillion to install as much wind and 
solar capacity as possible—laudable 
goal—and to drastically curtail and 
hopefully eliminate the need for coal, 
natural gas, and nuclear. This has left 
Germany with the highest electricity 
prices in the world—harming their 
households 
and 
their 
world-famous 
manufacturing sector. When they have 
found themselves short of supply, they 
have to import coal-fired electricity 
from Poland. 
We, here, in this country, would have 
no kind of international fallback. So 
while we try to mimic a path similar to 
Germany and shut down American coal 
mines, meanwhile China is building 
new coal plants that will wash out any 
of our supposed carbon reductions. 
American energy prices will skyrocket, 
and the Clean Energy Payment Plan 
will make a negligible impact on global 
emissions. 
The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund 
is another absurd provision in this rec-
onciliation package. This is basically a 
$27.5 billion slush fund for Democrat 
States to use whatever they would use 
for their so-called green projects. This 
will increase our reliance on critical 
minerals and energy supplies that we 
get from China and other international 
competitors trying to put forward en-
ergy-free technologies and particularly 
looking at the production of lithium 
batteries and solar energy that is pri-
marily produced in China. 
Another egregious provision tucked 
away in this reconciliation package is 
a $50 million expenditure to EPA to 
write new clean air regs. That is right, 
$50 million. They would give $50 mil-
lion to write a new version of President 
Obama’s Clean Power Plan and other 
devastating climate regulations. With 
the money, EPA will hire extra lawyers 
and bureaucrats to write additional 
regulations under section 111 and other 
provisions of the Clean Air Act in ways 
that they have never done before, all, 
in my view, which would put my hard- 
working West Virginians out of a job. 
These are just a few of the environ-
mental provisions in this reckless tax- 
and-spending spree. But the package is 
much broader than that. It is a wish 
list rolled into a $3.5 trillion bill that 
inserts the government into nearly 
every aspect of American life. The 
American people understand that pass-
ing this bill will harm our country by 
fueling inflation, and it will harm our 
country for generations to come as we 
add to our debt. 
It is no wonder that the Democrats 
are having so much trouble passing 
this. By shuttering our Federal Surface 
Transportation Programs last Friday, 
House Democrats made it abundantly 
clear that despite their rhetoric, phys-
ical infrastructure is not a priority. In-
stead, they have said that roads, 
bridges, broadband, water infrastruc-
ture—all 
infrastructure 
items 
that 
Americans in both parties support are 
only worth funding if they are accom-
panied by another $3.5 trillion in spend-
ing. 
I hope that our House colleagues will 
change their approach. The bipartisan 
infrastructure bill represents good pol-
icy, and it should be allowed to pass on 
its own merit. It will benefit every 
State in this country. It will provide 
the certainty of 5 years of funding for 
our Surface Transportation Programs 
and avoid future lapses like we saw last 
Friday. These programs cannot bounce 
from one short-term extension to the 
next. We have done that before. It is 
very, very difficult to conduct busi-
ness, and they should not play second 
fiddle to a package of partisan policies. 
We came together in this body to 
pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill 
that the American people can be proud 
of, and that bill should become law 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, last 
week, I came to the floor in support of 
Senator SCOTT’s bill pushing back on 
what many of us consider the unconsti-
tutional COVID vaccine mandates. I 
used my floor time to describe the lack 
of 
transparency 
of 
our 
healthcare 
Agencies by talking about the informa-
tion that our healthcare Agencies, the 
media, and the news media are not pro-
viding the American public. I come to 
the floor today to expand a little bit on 
that information. 
Now, last week, I presented this 
chart, which shows the daily number of 
new cases. Those are the blue lines. 
You actually have daily deaths—the 
tragic deaths—very thin red line. But 
you also have this line showing the 
percent of fully vaccinated Americans. 
Now, I pointed to this chart because 
this is not what I would expect to see 
if we had 100 percent effective vaccines. 
Now, let me again state, I was a big 
supporter of Operation Warp Speed. I 
am not an anti-vaxxer. I have had 
every vaccine up to this one because I 
had COVID. 
So I had hoped and prayed that the 
COVID vaccine would be 100 percent 
safe and 100 percent effective, but this 
chart is not what I would expect to 
have seen with a vaccine that was 
highly effective and what we all were 
hoping would happen once we had a 
high percentage of Americans vac-
cinated, together with those who al-
ready had COVID, like myself, with 
natural immunity. 
You can see, prior to the vaccine 
even being able to take effect, as the 
first major surge of the pandemic was 
winding down, I would have expected to 
see a continued winding down, but that 
is not what we saw. We have seen this 
surge in Delta, and we have seen addi-
tional deaths, and the tragedy con-
tinues. 
Now, back on September 9, President 
Biden said: This pandemic is of the 
unvaccinated. 
And he also said: This is not about 
freedom or personal choice. 
No, this is exactly about freedom and 
personal choice. President Biden also 
said in July of this year—on July 21, he 
said: If you are vaccinated, you are not 
going to be hospitalized. You are not 
going to be in the ICU unit. You are 
not going to die. You are not going to 
get COVID if you have these vaccina-
tions. 
Today, I received an email from a 
constituent in Wisconsin. I am going to 
read an excerpt. I am not going to iden-
tify the individual because he fears re-
prisals. He has seen what happens to 
people that tell the truth about COVID 
and COVID vaccines, so I will keep his 
name anonymous. 
But let me quote from his email: 
Both my parents were fully vaccinated 
with the Pfizer vaccine in the spring. 
Yet, in August, my mom became in-
fected and then gave it to my dad. 
They became so sick that my sister, 
fully vaccinated with Moderna, moved 
in with them to care for them. She 
used PPEs and was careful, and she 
caught COVID too. Hence, my family, 
three of us, caught COVID while fully 
vaccinated. They spread it while they 
were fully vaccinated, from vaccinated 
to vaccinated. My mom and sister re-
covered. Dad died in a week at home 
after a 3-week stay in the local hos-
pital.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6907 
October 5, 2021 
Now, that is a tragedy. I wish what 
President Biden said would have been 
true, but it is not. That talks to the 
vaccine’s efficacy. 
Let’s talk about vaccine safety. I 
have heard so often from who I refer to 
as the ‘‘COVID gods’’—the healthcare 
Agencies, the media, the news media— 
that vaccine adverse events are rare, 
and they are mild. Well, they are rare, 
and they are mild until they happen to 
you. 
Here is a chart that compares the 
number of deaths reported on the 
VAERS system. Now, this is the CDC’s 
own vaccine adverse event reporting 
system. And I charted this all the way 
back to 1990, at the beginning of the 
VAERS system, and I got deaths asso-
ciated with the flu vaccine there in 
blue. You can barely see them. But the 
largest year, the peak year for the 
VAERS-reported 
deaths 
associated 
with the flu vaccine was—in 2010, there 
was 162 reported deaths. 
Now, again, I understand that the 
VAERS does not prove causation. I 
have got that. But if you compare our 
experience since 1990 with the flu vac-
cine—by the way, it is generally about 
a third of the number of doses for an 
annual flu season versus what we have 
experienced with the COVID vaccine. 
So you compare that very low level 
of deaths reported on VAERS to what 
we now experienced with COVID, for 
just this count here, and it is 15,737 
worldwide for the 3 vaccines that have 
emergency use authorization in the 
United States. In total, it is 15,937 
deaths reported on the VAERS system. 
Now, again, I realize that does not 
prove causation, but I do need to point 
out that 5,272 of those deaths occurred 
on day zero, 1, or 2 following vaccina-
tion. Now, if I were in the CDC or FDA, 
those Agencies that in October of 2020 
touted the VAERS report, their early 
warning safety surveillance systems— 
before the vaccines ever got the emer-
gency use authorization—they were 
talking about how they were going to 
rely on these to provide the safety sig-
nals. I remember one member of the 
CDC saying: We are going to take ad-
verse events so seriously that if some-
body loses a couple of days work, lost 
work time because of an adverse event, 
we are going to get a CDC representa-
tive on the phone with that individual, 
and we are going to look into it. 
That simply has not happened. 
Now, one thing that the FDA has 
done is they have ridiculed some of the 
early treatment drugs. I don’t have it 
on the chart here, but I just want to 
put things in perspective. So, now, 
again, 15,937 deaths in about 10 months 
with the COVID vaccine. Ivermectin, 
since 1996, over 25 years, has 379 total 
deaths. That is 15,937, COVID vaccine; 
Ivermectin, 
379 
in 
25 
years; 
Hydroxychloroquine, about 1,039 deaths 
over 25 years; Remdesivir, which ap-
pears to be the drug of choice for hos-
pitalized COVID patients, 1,499 deaths. 
Again, that is information our Federal 
Agencies aren’t providing the Amer-
ican public, but this is information 
people need to know. 
Now, why am I giving you this infor-
mation? Well, first of all, on social 
media, this is suppressed. This is being 
censored. People like me that would 
even broach the subject of VAERS have 
been attacked. 
So I think it is important to come to 
the Senate floor so the American peo-
ple understand what is happening. But 
the main point I am trying to make is, 
those individuals who believe in their 
own health autonomy, believe in their 
own personal freedom, many of whom 
have 
already 
been 
infected 
with 
COVID, are reading the science and be-
lieve, based on what they are reading, 
that their natural immunity is prob-
ably as, if not more, effective than the 
vaccinated immunity and have chosen 
not to get the vaccine. That is their 
right. You may not agree with that, 
but it is not your body. It is not your 
right to impose on someone else a man-
date to take the vaccine or take away 
their job, take away their livelihood, 
and take away their healthcare. 
By the way, I am not the only one 
that thinks this. President Biden, back 
on December 4, said: I don’t think it 
should be mandatory. I wouldn’t de-
mand it be mandatory. 
The Press Secretary said: The vac-
cine mandate is not the Federal Gov-
ernment’s role. 
And yet here we are, nurses being 
fired. What do you think that is going 
to do to our healthcare system? We al-
ready have a severe healthcare worker 
shortage. We are going to exacerbate 
that problem. 
These 
mandates 
are 
unconstitu-
tional, but they are going to be incred-
ibly harmful for military readiness and 
for our healthcare system. They are 
also going to be incredibly corrosive to 
our society. 
I have been inundated—even well be-
fore President Biden announced his ill- 
advised and unconstitutional mandate, 
I have been inundated with emails and 
letters and phone calls from people who 
are so concerned about being coerced, 
being forced to take a vaccine under 
duress. It has had an incredibly corro-
sive effect on our society. 
But I want to quote from one par-
ticular letter. I got this letter from a 
nurse. She has a master’s degree. She 
is also a professor of nursing. She is de-
scribing what happened inside a meet-
ing of their faculty as they were decid-
ing how to handle mandates in their 
nursing school. 
She writes: Some of the biggest 
issues today are the conversations oc-
curring behind closed doors. Our nurs-
ing department faculty got together to 
decide how to handle the nearly 50 per-
cent of students that hadn’t yet re-
ceived their COVID–19 vaccination and 
faced being dismissed from their nurs-
ing program unless they complied. The 
students were referred to as ‘‘igno-
rant,’’ ‘‘uneducated,’’ ‘‘killers.’’ 
This name-calling, although deeply 
inappropriate, is becoming the cultural 
norm against the masses of those who 
decide that it is within their right to 
attack the personal choice of others. 
But if I were a student or a parent of 
a student who heard that interaction 
that I am about to share with you, you 
would be beyond furious. 
When it was determined by consensus 
of the faculty group that we were not 
going to allow any special accommoda-
tions—in other words, switching of 
clinical assignments or sites—to allow 
for 
the 
unvaccinated 
students 
to 
progress, and that will be the standard 
practice in all other nursing programs 
soon, one faculty member exclaimed to 
the group: ‘‘Good luck finding a new 
career.’’ 
And the group responded with laugh-
ter. 
This nurse writes: Let that sink in 
for a moment. They laughed. They 
laughed at the thought of someone’s 
dreams being crushed. 
That’s the effect these unconstitu-
tional, coercive, freedom-robbing man-
dates are having on our society. There 
is no need for them. 
As the previous email from my con-
stituent that I received today proves, 
even if you have been fully vaccinated, 
you can catch COVID. You can trans-
mit COVID. You can die from COVID. 
Now, it is a tragedy. I wish it weren’t 
so, but it is true. 
When are we going to start following 
the science? When are we going to re-
claim the freedom that has been lost in 
this pandemic? 
There has been enough harm done 
during the course of this pandemic. I 
am begging this body; I am begging the 
President, do no further harm. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2848 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, last week, I 
came to the Senate floor no fewer than 
three times and invited my colleagues 
to pass bills to protect millions of 
Americans at risk of losing their jobs, 
their livelihoods, due to President 
Biden’s COVID–19 vaccine mandate. 
Unfortunately, 
due 
to 
objections 
from the other side of the aisle, these 
bills were not adopted. But I com-
mitted then, as I do again today, that 
I will be back with additional proposals 
for as long as it takes to beat this 
sweeping mandate. 
Since I began this effort against the 
mandate, there has been a massive out-
pouring of support from across the 
country. I have heard from Americans 
in countless sectors, from multiple 
States, who are at risk of losing their 
jobs. These Americans just want to 
make their own medical decisions—a 
right that has always been afforded and 
not challenged since the beginning of 
our Nation. 
In Utah alone, I have heard from no 
fewer than 184 people who are at risk of 
losing their livelihoods. They and so 
many others, those who share the same 
concerns, are our neighbors; they are 
everyday Americans, and they have le-
gitimate medical concerns about get-
ting the vaccine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6908 
October 5, 2021 
But President Biden doesn’t care. He 
said simply, ‘‘This isn’t about freedom 
or personal choice.’’ 
Well, to the millions of Americans 
who face the punishment of being made 
unemployable if they do not succumb 
to the President’s will, this very much 
is about freedom and personal choice. 
There must be a more reasonable an-
swer. There must be a more compas-
sionate answer. 
The 
COVID–19 
vaccine 
has 
been 
deemed generally safe. I don’t dispute 
that. In fact, I, along with my entire 
family, have been vaccinated. I see the 
development of these vaccines as a 
miracle and a blessing. But there are 
some people with preexisting condi-
tions or complications. Many of these 
individuals have been advised by their 
trusted, board-certified doctors that 
they should not receive the vaccine. 
These Americans, they deserve to be 
able to make their own medical deci-
sions, and they should not be forced by 
the President of the United States to 
go against the advice of their doctors. 
Now let’s look down the road at what 
will necessarily follow this vaccine 
mandate. Countless Americans who fol-
low the recommendations of their doc-
tors would lose their jobs in an already 
troubled economy. These individuals 
and families would not be just unem-
ployed; the President of the United 
States would deem them unemploy-
able, second-class pariahs. Businesses 
that dare to employ the unvaccinated 
would be subject to crippling fines and 
risk closure. 
The President of the United States, 
unilaterally, without any say from the 
people’s Representatives in Congress, is 
set on imposing financial destruction 
on many American families and busi-
nesses. He is even targeting those with 
complicated medical conditions and 
forcibly removing them from the econ-
omy and much of broader society. 
So today, I am offering the Senate an 
option to take a more compassionate, 
reasonable approach. My bill, the Your 
Health Comes First Act, would exempt 
from the President’s mandate individ-
uals with personal health concerns re-
lated to the vaccine. 
Simply put, Americans who are wor-
ried about how the vaccine would 
interact with or compound their exist-
ing medical difficulties would not be 
obligated to get it. Those who have 
been advised by their doctors not to 
get the vaccine due to preexisting med-
ical conditions would not be forced to 
go against the recommendations of 
their doctor. 
This bill is a reasonable and a com-
passionate solution to allow concerned 
Americans the dignity and autonomy 
we all deserve. 
This isn’t the only flaw with the 
mandate. As I have said before, the 
President lacks authority to do this. 
Neither the Federal Government, in 
general, nor the President of the 
United States, in particular, has the 
power under the Constitution to imple-
ment a broad mandate of this sort. 
Whether 
you 
think 
government 
ought to be mandating it or not, 
whether you think government ought 
to force people out of their jobs if they 
refuse to get it or not, that is a dif-
ferent, analytically distinct question 
in our constitutional system from 
whether the Federal Government has 
the authority, generally, or the Presi-
dent, in particular, has the authority. 
It doesn’t, and he does not. 
These arguments need to remain at 
the forefront of the conversation: ques-
tions regarding the constitutionality 
and the constitutional authority to 
issue this in the first place. 
I will be back tomorrow with another 
proposal, and I will be at this for as 
long as it takes to end this unconstitu-
tional and uncompassionate mandate. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2848, 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. Yesterday, Tal-
lahassee Memorial Hospital disclosed 
that 
82 
people 
died 
inside 
their 
healthcare system from COVID over 
the course of the month of September. 
That is the worst month on record for 
that hospital system. 
It is not shocking to anyone because 
we just went passed 700,000 people who 
have now been killed by this virus in 
the United States of America. And this 
attack that continues to be launched 
on the Senate floor against science and 
against sound public health policy is 
standing in the way of us defeating this 
virus. 
Now, I will speak to Senator LEE’s 
objection, but Senator JOHNSON
just 
came to the floor and opened up his re-
marks by declaring he that wasn’t an 
anti-vaxxer and then just engaged in a 
10-minute broadside against vaccines, 
citing conspiracy theory after con-
spiracy theory. The effect will be to 
undermine America’s faith in vaccines 
that are working. 
To prove his point, the Senator from 
Wisconsin read an email from a con-
stituent who got the vaccine and got 
infected. 
I am sure that is true. There are, in 
fact, people who have gotten the vac-
cine who have gotten the infection. It 
isn’t 100 percent effective. 
But he didn’t cite these statistics: 
those who have been vaccinated are 10 
times less likely to be hospitalized. 
Those who have been vaccinated are 10 
times less likely to die. 
Here are some numbers from the 
State of Pennsylvania that I just saw 
this morning: In Pennsylvania, 97 per-
cent 
of 
deaths 
are 
amongst 
the 
unvaccinated; 95 percent of hospitaliza-
tions are amongst the unvaccinated; 
and 94 percent of cases are amongst the 
unvaccinated. 
Senator LEE is right, vaccines work— 
vaccines work, and I appreciate his 
statement to that effect. But others, 
like the Senator from Wisconsin, are 
coming down to the floor, and their 
words have the effect of undermining 
people’s faith in science, and that is 
deadly. That is deadly. 
As to Senator LEE’s objections, I 
know he makes them in good faith, but 
my impression is that this Congress 
and this country decided a long time 
ago that the government does have a 
role to play when it comes to the safe-
ty of our workplaces. In fact, that is 
the entire reason for the existence of 
OSHA. Whether you like it or not, from 
a policy perspective, OSHA has handed 
down mandate after mandate about 
what is necessary for employers to 
make sure that when you show up to 
work in a hospital or a factory or a 
school, that your workplace is safe. 
Specifically, this country is not a 
stranger to vaccine mandates. In fact, 
every parent who sends their kids to 
school knows all about vaccine man-
dates because you have to make sure 
that your child is vaccinated before 
they go to school. Most of those 
schools have relatively reasonable ex-
emptions—often, at the very least, 
medical exemptions; sometimes reli-
gious and philosophical exemptions. 
Let’s be clear: President Biden’s plan 
includes commonsense considerations 
for exemptions. 
Let’s also be clear that, at least with 
respect to the OSHA requirement, it is 
a mandate for testing, not for vaccina-
tions. There are other mandates that 
are requiring the vaccination take 
place, but the broadest of the proposed 
mandates is a mandate that everybody 
get tested; you don’t have to get tested 
if you get the vaccine. 
And so I am deeply worried about 
how unserious this country is about 
the science and about sound public 
health policy. We aren’t going to get 
over this pandemic—we aren’t going to 
be able to turn the page—unless people 
choose to get vaccinated: 10 times less 
likely to die, 10 times less likely to get 
hospitalized. 
Yes, it is true, there are cases in 
which there may be medical contra-
indications. President Biden’s plan ac-
counts for that. And yes, it is true that 
there are individual people who have 
still had breakthrough cases. But this 
is an effective vaccine. It is a safe vac-
cine. And the only way that we save 
lives is if we stop focusing on ideology 
and keep our focus on science and what 
works. 
And for that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the insight from my friend and distin-
guished colleague, the Senator from 
Connecticut.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6909 
October 5, 2021 
I want to be very clear: The limited 
focus of this bill—the bill that I offered 
up for passage in the Senate today—is 
narrow. 
It has one purpose: For those Ameri-
cans who have a medical concern and 
who have been advised by their doctor, 
based on some condition associated 
with their health, that they should not 
get it, they shouldn’t have to choose 
between getting vaccinated and losing 
their job. 
My friend from Connecticut goes so 
far, I think, as to implicitly acknowl-
edge that there ought to be an excep-
tion made for those people. One, he 
says, President Biden’s vaccine man-
date accommodates them. 
Well, there is a problem with that. 
President Biden hasn’t issued any-
thing. He has suggested, along with 
members of his administration, that 
there might be a somewhat accommo-
dation for them. I am not sure what 
that means, neither is corporate Amer-
ica. A lot of corporate America, acting 
on the advice of legal counsel and 
human resources departments, tends to 
be adopting rules already. Some of 
them take exceptions like these into 
account; others do not. 
Look, it is really not too much to 
ask. I suggest that if you are going to 
impose a sweeping mandate like this, 
that you ought to have some protec-
tion for people with complicating med-
ical conditions, who, on the advice of a 
board-certified physician, choose not to 
get it. 
Now, again, this does not mean that 
I am OK with the rest of the mandate; 
I am not. And I respectfully, but very 
strongly, disagree with my friend’s 
characterization that this is just fine 
for the Federal Government to do. 
The Federal Government lacks gen-
eral police powers. The lion’s share of 
the authority within government in 
our system lies with the States and 
their political subdivisions. 
Our national government is in charge 
of just a few basic and distinctively na-
tional matters: national defense, a uni-
formed system of weights and meas-
ures, trademarks, copyrights, and pat-
ents, regulating trade or commerce be-
tween the States with foreign nations 
and with the Indian Tribes. 
There are a number of others, but 
there is no power in there that just re-
fers to providing generally for laws 
that make the American people safe 
and healthy. 
Those powers exist in America; they 
just aren’t vested in this government. 
It doesn’t mean that States and local-
ities will always exercise that power 
wisely 
or 
prudently 
or 
compas-
sionately, but it means insofar as you 
are going to act through government, 
that is the appropriate place and not 
this one. 
Now, my friend from Connecticut 
then responds by saying, ‘‘Yeah, but 
the power is still there anyway.’’ 
Even if I were to assume his point 
that the power of the Federal Govern-
ment somehow extends to an individual 
vaccine mandate, which it doesn’t—and 
I would challenge him or anyone else 
to cite what provision of the U.S. Con-
stitution it is that that provides that 
authority—but even if we were to ac-
cept the premise, just for purposes of 
discussion, that the Federal Govern-
ment may exercise such authority, the 
President may not exercise that au-
thority alone. 
The very first clause of the first arti-
cle—in the first section of the first ar-
ticle of that Constitution says: ‘‘All 
legislative Powers herein granted shall 
be vested in our Congress of the United 
States, which shall consist of a Senate 
and House of Representatives.’’ 
Article I, section 7 then makes clear 
that in order to pass a law, a Federal 
law in the United States—that is, in 
order to adopt a policy of the Federal 
Government, enforceable through the 
overpowering force that is the Federal 
Government—you have to follow the 
article I, section 7 formula, which 
means you have to take a legislative 
proposal—a bill—you have to pass it in 
the House, and you have to pass it in 
the Senate with the same language— 
and it has to be submitted to the Presi-
dent for signature, veto, or acquies-
cence. 
If you don’t undertake that process 
at all, there is no authority in the ex-
ecutive to do anything like what they 
are describing. What President Biden 
has done is to arrogate to himself pow-
ers that he not only characterizes as 
Federal, but, really, are legislative 
powers that he doesn’t possess. 
The President of the United States is 
the chief executive. He is not a law-
maker. And he certainly is not the en-
tire legislative branch. And so that, 
really, is quite beside the point. 
It doesn’t make a difference with his 
Federal authority. The fact that Fed-
eral authority is asserted to exist, 
which it is not, and we can’t identify a 
single clause of article I, section 8, or 
another part of the Constitution that 
can fairly be read, especially against 
the backdrop of its original public 
meaning, to convey that power—but 
even if you concede that point, there is 
no reasonable, plausible, defensible ar-
gument that would say the President 
of the United States may wield this au-
thority unilaterally. 
That is what despots and tyrants 
would have the power to do. And if 
there is one thing that is very con-
sistent and uniform in our constitu-
tional structure it is that no one per-
son, no one group of people, is ever sup-
posed to be able to accumulate dan-
gerous degrees of power and that the 
President of the United States is nei-
ther a lawmaker nor the entire legisla-
tive branch. He may not step into 
those shoes. 
As to the assertion about science, my 
friend and colleague referred to this as 
somehow a war on science. It is not a 
war on science to suggest that the 
President lacks authority to do some-
thing unilaterally. I would call that a 
war on the Constitution, frankly. 
It is not a war on science to say that 
whenever a government acts, it ought 
to do so out of an abundance of caution 
and out of respect for the people to pro-
vide reasonable accommodations to in-
dividuals who have medical conditions 
that make them uniquely vulnerable to 
what the government is inclined to re-
quire. 
Again, this mandate is unconstitu-
tional. It doesn’t make the vaccine 
bad. In fact, the vaccine is a blessing, 
and I think the American people have 
been made safer as a result of it. 
That doesn’t mean every American 
must get it. It certainly doesn’t mean 
that it is any of the Federal Govern-
ment’s business to tell people that they 
have to choose between getting the 
vaccine and losing their job, especially 
with regard to individuals who have 
preexisting medical conditions that 
would make it dangerous for them to 
do so in the judgment of their board- 
certified medical physician. That is 
wrong. That is absolutely wrong. 
Now, look, COVID–19 has imposed a 
lot of tragedies, and it is heart-
breaking. A number of people we have 
lost, including the individuals who 
have died in the last month at Talla-
hassee Memorial Hospital, who he men-
tioned—every one of those lives is of 
infinite 
eternal 
value. 
Those 
are 
unrepeatable lives lost to a deadly pan-
demic. My heart goes out to each one 
of those souls who has departed, along 
with their families. 
We are reminded of the lives that 
have tragically been lost to COVID–19 
by an exhibit that has been up on the 
Mall, up around the Washington Monu-
ment. It is beautiful, really. There are 
little flags—small flags—each of them 
white, each one representing one of the 
Americans 
who 
has 
been 
lost 
to 
COVID–19 since it broke out just over a 
year and a half ago. There are about 
700,000 of those around the Washington 
Monument. From a distance, it looks a 
little like snow. 
I come from a State where there is 
usually snow at the top of mountains. 
It looks familiar to me when I see what 
looks like snow from a distance, but it 
is somber as I remember what they ac-
tually represent. 
If we want to talk about the loss of 
human life, we have to talk about the 
loss of all human life, and we also have 
to talk about the right of each indi-
vidual to live and to continue living 
and to follow the advice of medical 
doctors based on the individuals’ own 
medical conditions. 
I sometimes find staggering the accu-
sations that those who have concerns 
with this are somehow committing a 
war on science. Against which science? 
Who exactly is it that is against 
science—the science that tells us that 
unborn human life can experience and 
respond to pain in the womb in 15 or 20 
weeks of gestational development? 
What would it look like if we had a 
separate memorial with little red flags 
instead of little white ones, each rep-
resenting one of the human lives lost 
every single year to abortion?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6910 
October 5, 2021 
You see, every single year we lose 
about the same number of human lives 
to abortion as we have lost to COVID 
since it first broke out. If for the last 
50 years we had a little red flag, each 
marking one of those human lives lost, 
there would be a sea of red. It would 
take up not just the grass all around 
the Washington Monument, which is 
large, it would probably take up all the 
grass between the Capitol, the Wash-
ington Monument, and the Lincoln Me-
morial. It would be a sea of red. 
So, no, no, you can’t say that this is 
a war on science to be concerned about 
individuals being able to make their 
own decision about whether to get this 
vaccine. 
If you want to accuse people on the 
other side of the aisle of doing some-
thing, you have to stop and think 
about other decisions that we make— 
other decisions that some are willing 
to defend, decisions that involve a 
whole lot of human suffering and a 
whole lot of loss of a whole lot of 
human lives. 
I get that a lot of people disagree on 
these things, but the fact that we dis-
agree on them doesn’t mean that they 
don’t exist. It certainly doesn’t mean 
that we can stand by and watch as if a 
vestigial legislative organ—as one sin-
gle man steps into the shoes of 435 Rep-
resentatives or 100 Senators—makes, as 
it were, a law that, on its own, fails 
even to accommodate good-faith med-
ical concerns backed up by medical 
science. 
It is too bad that we couldn’t pass 
this simple law today. We could have; 
we should have; I wish we would have. 
I will be back. This issue isn’t going 
away. Neither am I. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask

NOMINATION OF LAUREN J. KING 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to sup-
port the nomination of Lauren King to 
serve as judge for the U.S. District 
Court of Western Washington. I am 
pleased to have recommended her to 
President Biden. 
As a citizen of the Muscogee Nation, 
Ms. King will be the first Native Amer-
ican Federal judge from my home 
State and only the sixth-ever Native 
judge in our country’s history. 
She is extremely well qualified and 
has an abundance of Tribal court expe-
rience, something that is very impor-
tant in my State. We are home to 29 
federally recognized Tribes, and it is 
long overdue that our Federal court 
system includes those who have deep 
understanding 
and 
appreciation 
of 
Tribal trust responsibilities and Fed-
eral Indian law. 
Ms. King has extensive litigation ex-
perience and is a recognized leader in 
Tribal law. She has been a pro tem ap-
pellate judge for the Northwest Inter-
tribal Court System since 2013. She has 
also served as a commissioner on the 
Washington State Gambling Commis-
sion and chairs her law firm’s Native 
American Law Practice Group. 
A graduate from the University of 
Washington and the University of Vir-
ginia School of Law, she has also 
taught Federal Indian law at Seattle 
University. She has earned the support 
of the National Congress of American 
Indians, the Affiliated Tribes of North-
west Indians, and other leading Native 
organizations. 
I know she will make an excellent ad-
dition to our court in the Western Dis-
trict of Washington, and I urge my col-
leagues to support her nomination.

f 
TRIBUTE TO ANITA DEASON 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor the service of Colonel (re-
tired) Anita Deason as she retires from 
her work on behalf of the people of Ar-
kansas, and especially the military and 
veterans community, as a member of 
my staff in the U.S. Senate. 
Colonel Deason started her lifetime 
of service at 19 years old when she 
joined the Arkansas Army National 
Guard. She retired from that career in 
2013 with 33 years of service and soon 
after joined my staff as our military 
and veterans liaison. Throughout her 
tenure with my office, she has used her 
knowledge and experience to improve 
programs and services for countless 
veterans and their families. 
Over the past 7 years, Colonel Deason 
has traveled all across the Natural 
State to meet with veterans’ organiza-
tions; visit local, State, and Federal fa-
cilities, as well as nonprofits; and re-
solve countless problems for her fellow 
veterans. Whether bringing groups to-
gether to tackle difficult issues or 
lending her support to promising new 
programs, she used every skill and con-
nection she had to improve the lives of 
the men and women who serve our 
State and our Nation. 
Of all her accomplishments during 
her time in the Senate, Anita is prob-
ably best known as a champion of the 
Library of Congress Veterans History 
Project. She spearheaded my office’s 
involvement in this program to ensure 
that stories of America’s veterans are 
recorded for generations to come. At 
that time, Arkansas veterans were 
underrepresented in this national col-
lection, so she set out to conduct inter-
views and train other Arkansans to do 
the same. She ensured that veterans 
from all eras are included and that pre-
viously overlooked stories were re-
corded from veterans of color, women 
veterans, and others who served our 
country with honor and helped shape 
our modern military. She taught work-
shops, 
gave 
media 
interviews 
and 
trained other congressional staff, all in 
an effort to make the project even 
more robust and successful because of 
her passion for helping to learn about 
and preserve our former servicemem-
bers’ stories and experiences. 
Her tenure in the Senate is only a 
small portion of Colonel Deason’s pub-
lic service. During her career in the Ar-
kansas Army National Guard, she 
served as a platoon leader, detachment 
commander, company executive offi-
cer, and company commander. She was 
eventually promoted to colonel while 
serving as the human resources officer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6912 
October 5, 2021 
She received a number of awards and 
decorations during her military career 
including the Legion of Merit, Meri-
torious Service Medal, and the Arkan-
sas Commendation Medal. In 2018, she 
was inducted into the Arkansas Mili-
tary Veterans Hall of Fame. It was a 
well-deserved honor for her tremendous 
military service and her dedication to 
fighting for the needs of servicemem-
bers and veterans throughout her years 
with the U.S. Senate. 
It has been a blessing and true honor 
to have Anita Deason as a member of 
my team. Her unique perspective, dedi-

S. 4. A bill to amend the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 to revise the criteria 
for determining which States and polit-
ical subdivisions are subject to section 
4 of the Act, and for other purposes; 
read the first time. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is real-
ly with hope, pride, and optimism that 
I rise today to honor the legacy of an 
icon of the civil rights movement, a 
hero of democracy, and a dear personal 
friend of mine: John Lewis. 
More than anything, John Lewis was 
a man of action. Where he saw suf-
fering, he tried to end it. Where he saw 
injustice, he tried to correct it. Where 
‘‘good trouble’’ was needed, he showed 
up for it. 
The most fitting way to honor the 
legacy of John Lewis is to take action 
ourselves—the action that he would 
have. So it is with pride today that I 
introduce 
the 
John 
Lewis 
Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021. It is a 
vital piece of legislation to restore the 
landmark Voting Rights Act. 
Now, this legislation is the culmina-
tion of many months of tireless work 
across the Halls of Congress, back and 
forth between the House and the Sen-
ate. But that is exactly what Congress-
man Lewis would have wanted to see. 
That work began by building the 
record and telling the story of the cur-
rent conditions for voters across the 
country. 
But what did that record show? 
A shocking picture. 
Empowered by the Supreme Court’s 
damaging 2013 decision in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder, States across the country 
have been advancing and enacting 
sweeping voter suppression efforts to 
make it more—not less—difficult for 
American citizens to participate in 
their own democracy. 
Can you imagine that—making it 
harder for Americans to participate in 
their own democracy? 
And today, tens of thousands of 
Americans are being disenfranchised 
under the guise of State law. And it is 
no coincidence that certain commu-
nities consistently bear the brunt of 
these suppression schemes across the 
country. 
Throughout our history, we have 
worked to make our democracy ever 
more inclusive, not exclusive. With 
each generation, we have sought to em-
power millions more to be equal par-
ticipants in America’s system of self- 
government. So make no mistake: This 
tidal wave of voter suppression effort 
seeks to bend the arc of equal justice 
and equal rights backward. We should 
not allow that to stand. 
Action in Congress is desperately 
needed. The House answered the call 
from Congressman Lewis and others to 
protect our precious, almost sacred 
right to vote, and they passed a bold 
version of the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act earlier this 
year. 
Today, in the Senate, we will be in-
troducing a version of that bill that 
should get the votes needed to restore 
the Voting Rights Act. 
This legislation addresses the Court’s 
2013 and 2021 decision. This should be 
advanced here. It should be passed by 
the House, and it surely would be 
signed into law. And there is no reason 
for delay. 
This legislation addresses the Su-
preme Court’s Shelby County decision 
by restoring the Justice Department’s 
preclearance powers to prevent States 
from enacting discriminatory voting 
changes. The legislation limits the 
harms caused by the Supreme Court’s 
Brnovich decision earlier this year by 
enshrining a private right of action and 
clear factors with which voters can 
bring lawsuits against attempts to dis-
enfranchise them. 
Fundamentally, 
this 
legislation 
seeks to ensure that the Justice De-
partment possesses the tools it needs 
to protect the right to vote for all 
Americans, regardless of party or race 
or creed or background. 
Now, you wouldn’t know by listening 
to the partisan rancor of today’s poli-
tics, but this goal—protecting our 
right to vote—has never been a par-
tisan issue. 
John Lewis once said: ‘‘We all know 
this is not a Democratic Republican 
issue. It is an American one.’’ 
Truer words haven’t been spoken. 
We should remember that reauthor-
izing the Voting Rights Act on a bipar-
tisan basis is the way we have always 
done it. The core provisions of the Vot-
ing Rights Act have been reauthorized 
five times. Remember that, five times. 
Every time, this has been done with 
overwhelming bipartisan support in 
Congress. It was signed by President 
Nixon. It was signed by President 
Reagan. It was signed by President 
George W. Bush. They all signed the 
Voting Rights Act reauthorizations 
into law. They knew the profound im-
portance of the landmark law for our 
democracy. In fact, the most recent 
Voting Rights Act reauthorization was 
in 2006. 
And do you know what the vote was 
in the U.S. Senate? 
Ninety-eight to zero. And many Sen-
ators still serving today, both Repub-
lican and Democrat, voted to support 
that legislation. 
The toxic partisanship of American 
politics today has obscured what has, 
for decades, united us across party 
lines. This is the belief that protecting 
our right to vote—the very right that 
gives democracy its name—is bigger 
than party or politics. It is the belief 
that a system of self-government—a 
government of, by, and for the people— 
is one that is worth preserving for gen-
erations to come. It is the belief that 
government exists to serve the will of 
the people, not the other way around. 
And that, Mr. President, is what I be-
lieve. 
And so, today, I hold the memory of 
John Lewis—of his advocacy, of his 
passion, of his zealous belief to our bet-
ter angels—to urge all Senators, re-
gardless of party, to join me in restor-
ing 
and 
reauthorizing 
the 
Voting 
Rights Act. The John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act gives us that 
opportunity. 
Congressman 
Lewis, 
I 
know, would have wanted us to come 
together and find a path forward to ad-
dressing 
the 
many 
threats 
facing 
Americans’ foundational right to vote. 
I will tell you what he would not 
have accepted. He would not have ac-
cepted inaction. So let’s try to live up 
to the memory and the example of 
John Lewis—a heroic man of action, 
one of my dearest friends in my years 
in the Congress. And I know he is 
watching over us. Let’s make him 
proud. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me thank my friend, our chairman 
of the Judiciary, Senator LEAHY, not 
only for introducing this legislation 
but for his dedication to voting rights 
over the many decades that he has 
served in this body. Few have done 
more to push voting rights to make 
sure people have the right to vote with-
out some of the barriers that have al-
ways been placed in the way by people 
who want to discriminate against peo-
ple—particularly people of color—when 
it comes to voting. So I thank him. 
Mr. President, the story of American 
democracy is a messy tale of starts and 
stops. For over 240 years, our march to 
establish the United States as a full de-
mocracy has always seemed to involve 
two steps forward, one step back. 
Today, I am proud to join my col-
leagues, Senators LEAHY and DURBIN, 
as they lead this Chamber in another 
bold step forward by introducing the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, a long-overdue update to the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. No piece of 
legislation has done more to protect 
the franchise than the Voting Rights

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6917 
October 5, 2021 
Act 
of 
the 
sixties. 
Its 
critical 
preclearance provision compelled juris-
dictions with recent histories of dis-
crimination to secure Federal approval 
before amending their election laws. 
For decades, the Senate reauthorized 
the VRA’s preclearance provisions with 
bipartisan votes because both parties 
understood that this powerful Federal 
tool made our democracy stronger. 
Sadly, in 2013, a conservative majority 
on the Supreme Court gutted the 
VRA’s preclearance and cleared the 
way for some of the most repressive 
voter suppression laws we have seen in 
generations. 
For those Supreme Court Justices 
who said this is not necessary, I think 
they should look at what as happened 
since preclearance was eliminated. It is 
just awful, and it was one of the lowest 
moments of the Supreme Court in re-
cent memory: the Shelby decision. 
Now, because of that Shelby decision, 
in 2021, 19 States, just in this year, 2021, 
have enacted 33 laws that will limit 
Americans’ access to the ballot, ac-
cording to the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice at New York University. What we 
are seeing across the States today is 
nothing short of Jim Crow in the 21st 
century, aided and abetted and allowed 
by the Shelby decision, which so tied 
the hands of the Justice Department 
when discriminatory legislation was 
being enacted at the State level. 
The Senate must fight back. We must 
restore the preclearance provisions of 
the Voting Rights Act and retailor it 
to meet the challenges of the 21st cen-
tury. That is what the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act will do. 
As an important complement to the 
Freedom to Vote Act, it will reestab-
lish the VRA’s preclearance coverage 
formula—based on an updated, robust 
catalog of modern-day voter suppres-
sion laws—while adopting new provi-
sions to address the next generation of 
suppressive voting. This new bill also 
responds to the Court’s troubling rul-
ing in Brnovich earlier this year, which 
even further weakened the VRA’s pro-
tections against State practices that 
hinder minorities seeking to vote. 
We have to be brutally honest. This 
country has to look at itself in the 
mirror. Racial barriers to the ballot 
are, regrettably, part of our past, our 
present, and now, with some of these 
decisions, part of our future. When the 
Nation was founded, you had to be a 
White male Protestant property owner 
in many of the States to vote. Today, 
we have come a long way in our strug-
gle to live up to our country’s founding 
promise, and this bill takes the next 
step by restoring the proper role of the 
Federal Government to protect Ameri-
cans’ constitutional right to partici-
pate in our democracy. 
As Senator WARNOCK
has so elo-
quently stated, we must put out the 
fire that is presently engulfing our de-
mocracy, and that is what the Freedom 
to Vote Act will do. We must build a 
state-of-the-art fire department to pre-
vent future fires. That is what the re-
forms of the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act will do. 
This is a good bill. This is an urgent 
bill. As majority leader, it is my inten-
tion to hold a vote on this legislation 
in the near future. I am proud to des-
ignate this ‘‘S. 4’’ to mark its critical 
restoration 
of 
the 
section 
4 
preclearance formula. 
We hope that all of our colleagues 
will join us in good faith in advancing 
solutions to ensure all Americans have 
their voices heard in their democracy. 
If some of our colleagues on the other 
side have different ideas of how to pro-
tect free and fair elections, we urge 
them to put them forward. But we will 
not be deterred just because some of 
our colleagues choose to stand silent 
with their arms crossed, content to 
play politics with the health of our Re-
public. On this issue, the Senate must 
act, and we will act. 
I want to thank again my colleagues 
Senators LEAHY and DURBIN for their 
diligence and leadership on this impor-
tant piece of legislation and for all 
they do to make sure this Chamber al-
ways works to strengthen our precious 
democracy. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the majority leader for his en-
couraging and kind words and espe-
cially thank my friend and former 
chair of the Judiciary Committee, Sen-
ator PAT LEAHY of Vermont, for invit-
ing other colleagues to come to the 
floor to speak in support of the right to 
vote. 
Time and again in history, we have 
asked men and women to stand and 
risk their lives and, in fact, give their 
lives for the most fundamental premise 
of our democracy: the right to vote. 
They have fought. They have bled. 
They have died for that right. 
Now it is under attack again—not 
from any foreign source. Over the past 
few years, our Nation has witnessed the 
most heavily coordinated assault on 
the right to vote in modern memory. 
Since the start of 2021, Republican leg-
islators throughout the country have 
introduced over 425 pieces of legisla-
tion with provisions to make it more 
difficult for Americans to vote. Thirty- 
three of these laws were actually en-
acted in 19 States. Some of these laws 
have set new limits on voting by mail; 
others cut hours for polling locations. 
Each of these proposals is designed to 
achieve the same outcome: create bar-
riers for Americans when it comes to 
the ballot box. 
One of the strongest champions of de-
mocracy in American history was my 
old friend and colleague John Lewis of 
Georgia. Days before his passing, John 
wrote: ‘‘Democracy is not a state. It is 
an act, and each generation must do its 
part to help build what we called the 
Beloved Community, a nation and 
world society at peace with itself.’’ 
It is now this generation’s turn to 
act, John, because nothing less than 
the survival of America’s democracy is 
at stake. 
At a moment when lawmakers across 
the country are railing around the Big 
Lie to strip away our constitutional 
rights, we in this Senate must have the 
courage to step up and protect those 
rights. If the supporters of the former 
President of the United States are 
going to defame our democracy, we 
have to fight to defend it. We can begin 
by reinvigorating one of the most im-
portant pieces of legislation in modern 
American history: the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965. 
I am sure there are folks who are 
watching this at home, saying: Wait a 
minute. How can a piece of legislation 
signed into law more than 50 years ago 
be the solution to today’s challenge to 
democracy? 
That is because over the past several 
years, there has been a sustained effort 
to chip away at the protections guar-
anteed to every American under that 
Voting Rights Act. 
For instance, in 2013, the Supreme 
Court issued the decision in Shelby 
County v. Holder, essentially nullifying 
a key provision in the Voting Rights 
Act, section 5. Prior to the Court’s rul-
ing in Shelby, section 5 required that 
localities 
with 
a 
track 
record 
of 
disenfranchising 
voters 
of 
color 
through tactics as brutal as poll taxes 
and literacy tests would have to seek 
Federal approval for changes they 
make in their voting rules. This re-
quirement is known as preclearance, 
and it could have prevented many of 
the restrictive voting provisions being 
enacted in States like Georgia and 
Texas today. 
Just this past summer, the Supreme 
Court weakened another section of the 
Voting Rights Act with its decision in 
Brnovich v. Democratic National Com-
mittee. 
With these wrongful rulings, the Su-
preme Court has fueled State-led ef-
forts to suppress voters, particularly 
voters of color. In fact, Justice Elena 
Kagan wrote in her dissent to Brnovich 
that ‘‘in the last decade, this Court has 
treated no statute worse’’ than the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
It is time for Congress to uphold our 
constitutional obligation and restore 
the Voting Rights Act to its full poten-
tial. That is why we join together 
today to introduce a bill that would 
not only restore the protections of the 
Voting Rights Act but strengthen 
them. 
Tomorrow, we will hold a hearing on 
this critical legislation in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. It is called the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. By all means, passing this 
law should be a bipartisan endeavor. 
Historically, it always was. It wasn’t 
until very recently that the Repub-
licans—the party of Abraham Lin-
coln—decided 
that 
they 
would 
no 
longer join in our effort to reauthorize 
the Voting Rights Act. It wasn’t that 
long ago that it was bipartisan and 
passed easily. The last time Congress 
voted to do so, in fact, the Republican 
minority leader, Senator MCCONNELL, 
came to the floor and said: ‘‘This is a 
piece of legislation which has worked.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6918 
October 5, 2021 
Well, let’s make sure we keep it 
working for America. In our Nation, 
there is no freedom more fundamental 
than the right to vote, and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
will help ensure that every American 
can exercise that right that he fa-
mously called the ‘‘precious, almost sa-
cred’’ right. 
I want to thank Senator LEAHY, Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, and my colleague 
Senator WARNOCK for joining us on the 
floor and a number of our colleagues 
for the collaboration and hard work on 
preparing this legislation for introduc-
tion and our House colleagues who 
passed their version of the bill earlier 
this summer. 
I particularly want to thank the man 
for whom this bill is named. I was hon-
ored to count him as a friend—even 
more when he came in on more than 
one occasion at my invitation to cam-
paign in the State of Illinois. I was 
honored to join him on a Sunday morn-
ing walk, which I will never forget, 
over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John 
and I talking about that moment in 
history. It is something I will treasure 
for a lifetime. 
We, in his name, need to honor him 
and to honor the principles that he 
gave his life for, making certain that 
everyone has an opportunity to help us 
build a beloved community. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am so proud and honored to be with my 
colleagues 
Senator LEAHY, Senator 
DURBIN, and Senator WARNOCK—all of 
us who are championing the Senate 
version of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. I think any 
of us would be honored to be spear-
heading a bill named for one of our he-
roes. 
This bill has particular significance 
to all of us because we lived through 
the time—the summer of 1965—when 
States 
mercilessly 
attacked 
John 
Lewis and 600 others as they crossed 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, 
AL, in peaceful protest to protect their 
right to vote. 
In the wake of that attack, as the 
Nation came together to grieve, Presi-
dent Johnson joined with Congress to 
pursue, as he put it, ‘‘an end to voting 
discrimination in America.’’ 
Roughly a week after the attack, 
President Johnson called for com-
prehensive voting rights legislation. 
Two days later, Congress announced 
that it would take up that legislation. 
So by early August, just 5 months after 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ in Selma, the Voting 
Rights Act was passed by Congress 
with broad bipartisan support and be-
came, again in the words of President 
Johnson, ‘‘one of the most monumental 
laws in the entire history of American 
freedom.’’ 
Today, with the introduction of this 
legislation, we honor the legacy of 
John Lewis. We honor everyone in-
volved in that great movement at the 
time that advanced civil rights and lib-
erty, the most fundamental being the 
right to vote, and we honor the fight 
itself to protect the franchise. 
A century after the Civil War ended, 
our Nation had failed to eradicate the 
blight of racial discrimination in vot-
ing. The promise of equality—political 
equality as well as economic equality— 
remained unfulfilled for Black citizens. 
The Voting Rights Act did what even 
the 14th and 15th Amendments failed to 
do, proving to be a uniquely powerful 
tool with the capacity to meet ever- 
new forms of discrimination through 
its preclearance regime. 
Then, in 2013, the U.S. Supreme 
Court, in Shelby County—well known 
to all of us—gutted, absolutely evis-
cerated 
the 
highly 
effective 
preclearance regime, jeopardizing the 
progress the Voting Rights Act made 
over the course of half a century. 
As Justice Ginsburg said in her mov-
ing and powerful dissent in Shelby, 
until Congress enacted the Voting 
Rights Act’s preclearance requirement, 
early attempts to cope with the vile in-
fection of racial discrimination in vot-
ing ‘‘resembled battling the Hydra. 
Whenever one form of voting discrimi-
nation was identified and prohibited, 
others sprang up in their place.’’ 
Today’s reinvigorated efforts to de-
prive members of minority groups from 
equal access to the ballot box through 
more subtle, second-generation bar-
riers prove that a new preclearance re-
gime is needed now more than ever. 
This year alone, we have experienced 
the most destructive legislative session 
for voting rights in generations, with 
States and localities enacting a torrent 
of new voting restrictions, all of it de-
signed to suppress the vote, to curtail 
the franchise, to move back the clock 
on voting rights. 
Between January 1 and July 14 of 
this year, more than 400 voting restric-
tion bills have been introduced in 49 
States—49 States—and 18 States suc-
cessfully enacted 30 laws that make it 
harder for people to vote. 
These laws make mail voting and 
early voting more difficult. They ma-
nipulate the boundaries of districts to 
reduce minority representation, and 
they have led to the purge of up to 3.1 
million voters from the rolls in areas 
that were once covered by the Voting 
Rights Act preclearance requirement. 
In short, this threat is more than 
just speculative, far from imaginative 
or suggestive. The threat is real and 
urgent. In fact, it is more than a 
threat. It is action now moving forward 
in States. 
Today’s legislation would confront 
this resurgence of voting restrictions 
very directly. The new John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act includes 
new formulas to revive preclearance. 
By focusing specifically on jurisdic-
tions with a proven history of discrimi-
nation 
and 
on 
preventing 
specific 
known discriminatory practices from 
taking effect in areas of increasing di-
versity before they can do damage, this 
new preclearance coverage formula re-
sponds to the Supreme Court’s con-
cerns and will allow the Voting Rights 
Act to keep pace with present condi-
tions and America’s rapidly changing 
demographics. 
The bill also reinvigorates the De-
partment of Justice’s ability to chal-
lenge discriminatory laws already in 
effect, reversing the Supreme Court’s 
latest attack on Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act in Brnovich v. Demo-
cratic National Committee. That 6–3 
partisan decision was a stunning dis-
play of judicial overreach—a highly po-
litical, highly partisan decision that 
gives new meaning to the phrase ‘‘judi-
cial activism,’’ a case of judicial over-
reach. 
Protecting the right to vote, very 
simply, should not be a partisan issue. 
In fact, voting rights are widely sup-
ported throughout American society— 
on the left, right, center, private, and 
in public sectors. 
Since the original inception of the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act 
of 
1965, 
over-
whelming bipartisan majorities of both 
Houses of Congress reauthorized the 
Voting Rights Act five times. 
Let me repeat: Both Houses of Con-
gress, 
bipartisan 
majority, 
over-
whelming vote, five times since the 
original passage of the Voting Rights 
Act in 1965. 
And for nearly a century after the 
Civil War and before the Voting Rights 
Act, the scourge of racial discrimina-
tion in voting challenged our Nation’s 
core commitment to these ideals of de-
mocracy. From that century of sac-
rifice and suffering came the Voting 
Rights Act and its extraordinary com-
mitment to realizing our Nation’s 
highest ideals; and for decades, it 
worked with bipartisan support over-
whelmingly. 
The Judiciary Committee, under the 
leadership of Senator DURBIN and Sen-
ator LEAHY, has documented power-
fully the need for this Act. 
And my Subcommittee on the Con-
stitution has held one hearing already. 
We will have another shortly that will 
set the record—in fact, provide the evi-
dentiary support—that the Supreme 
Court erroneously found lacking in its 
Shelby decision. 
As a tsunami of voter suppression 
bills crashes against the shores of our 
democracy, my hope is that today we 
can renew a bipartisan commitment to 
protecting voting rights in this coun-
try. 
I am proud to help lead this effort in 
the Senate, and I want to thank my 
colleagues again for being on the floor 
today. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, as a 
proud son of the great State of Georgia 
and a voice for our State here in this 
Chamber, I am deeply honored to join 
my colleagues here today to introduce 
this important legislation in honor of 
one of Georgia’s and America’s most 
influential public servants. 
I am grateful for the comments of 
Senator BLUMENTHAL, and I want to 
thank Senator LEAHY and all of my 
colleagues for their leadership in intro-
ducing this bill that carries on the leg-
acy of Congressman Lewis’s pivotal

October 5, 2021 
work to protect the sacred right to 
vote. 
John Lewis was my parishioner, and 
as I stand in support of this legislation 
named in his honor, I think of the 
many conversations I had with him 
over the years. I think of the Sunday 
mornings we boarded a bus, taking 
souls to the polls because I believe that 
voting, as he did, is a sacred under-
taking. At root, it is about people’s 
voice. And in that sense, it is about 
one’s humanity. 
I learned so much from Congressman 
Lewis and the lessons from his lived ex-
periences working deep in the trenches 
to defend and advance voting rights. He 
laid it all on the line. When President 
Johnson took his pen and signed this 
legislation, making it law in a real 
sense, what he etched had already been 
affirmed in blood—the risk that John 
Lewis took, the ultimate sacrifice that 
others made as they lost their lives 
fighting for the vote, the voice, the hu-
manity of every child of God. 
And one of the most important tools 
that came out of that activism, that 
came out of that human sacrifice—one 
of the most important tools in this leg-
islation is the process of preclearance. 
This process required that jurisdictions 
with a proven history of voting rights 
violations get approval from the De-
partment of Justice or our Federal 
courts before making changes to local 
voting administration. 
And, for decades, this was the tool 
that helped enfranchise countless vot-
ers, ensuring that they would have ac-
cess to the ballot to exercise their con-
stitutional right, and it kept some of 
the worst voter suppression efforts at 
bay. 
And then, in 2013, the Supreme Court, 
in Shelby v. Holder, asked the Congress 
to update the coverage formula that 
determines which States are subject to 
preclearance. The Supreme Court said 
that this preclearance formula had 
somehow been outdated and Congress 
ought to bring it up to date. That is 
what they asked us to do in 2013. 
Since then, Congress has been unwill-
ing to act. Preclearance has been al-
lowed to atrophy. And we have seen the 
results not only in Georgia, but in 
Texas, in Arizona, in Pennsylvania, all 
across our country. Earlier this year in 
Georgia, State leaders enacted a voter 
suppression law that will undoubtedly 
make it harder for some people to vote. 
If the tool of preclearance were in 
place right now, SB202 in Georgia like-
ly would not even be on the books. 
I think of Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg in her dissenting opinion. When 
that decision came down, she said: 
Throwing out preclearance when it has 
worked and is continuing to work to stop 
discriminatory changes is like throwing 
away your umbrella in a rainstorm because 
you are not getting wet. 
We threw away our umbrella, and we 
have found ourselves in the midst of a 
torrential rainstorm. Voter suppres-
sion laws are mushrooming all over the 
country. We are witnessing right now 
what happens to our democracy with-
out the protections of preclearance and 
the other vital provisions of the Voting 
Rights Act. 
The lack of robust voting rights pro-
tections has ramifications for every 
American, as we have seen efforts ramp 
up this year at passing sweeping, 
State-level voter suppression laws—not 
laws that only impact Black people and 
people of color, to be sure, but also stu-
dents, seniors, whomever certain poli-
ticians are afraid of will somehow get 
in the way of their craven march to 
power. 
And so this bill, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, is about 
Congress finally doing its job—finally 
doing what the Supreme Court asked 
us to do in 2013. It should have been 
done a long time ago. 
The updated Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act we are introducing today re-
stores the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It 
strengthens our democracy by reestab-
lishing preclearance, and it makes it 
better by updating it to also protect 
against specific practices we know sup-
press the vote, like polling place clo-
sures and new types of voter roll 
purges happening not only in the 
South, but all over the country. 
Our bill also restores Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act to protect minority 
communities from discriminatory vot-
ing practices after the Supreme Court 
diminished Section 2 earlier this year. 
Mr. President, just like the Freedom 
to Vote Act me and many of my col-
leagues introduced just a few weeks 
ago to set national standards for vot-
ing so every eligible voice is heard, the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act we introduce today is de-
signed to meet future challenges and 
address additional antidemocratic ef-
forts aimed at suppressing the vote all 
over our country. 
Since I was elected on January 5, 
since that terrible day on January 6, 
when this very Capitol was assaulted, 
we have seen more than 400 proposals 
in 49 States. So the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act builds for us 
a fire station to protect against future 
fires, but the house of democracy is al-
ready on fire. And so we need the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
but we also need the Freedom to Vote 
Act. We have got to put out the fire. 
We have got to build a fire station for 
future fires. 
Mr. President, I know there is a lot 
on our plate, but we can’t waste any 
time getting these bills passed. We can 
walk and chew gum at the same time. 
John Lewis walked across a bridge in 
order to build a bridge to a new Amer-
ican future. We already had infrastruc-
ture. He understood that the infra-
structure of our democracy was in 
trouble, and so he walked across a 
bridge in order to build a bridge. 
So the House has already passed a 
version of this act. And I know my 
friend, Senator JOE MANCHIN, has been 
having conversations about the Free-
dom to Vote Act with our friends 
across the aisle. We are happy to talk 
to anybody on both sides of the aisle. A 
similar version of this legislation has 
been voted up by this Chamber repeat-
edly in the past with strong bipartisan 
support. Some 16 Republican Senators 
who were either here or in the House 
when it passed in 2006 98–0 are here 
today, and I ask them: What is the dif-
ference? 
Voting rights are not just another 
issue. Voting rights are a preservative 
of all other rights. Voting rights are 
about the foundation of our democracy. 
And I believe that if the world’s great-
est deliberative body can’t find a way 
forward to get this done, history will 
judge us harshly, and rightly so. 
Reinhold 
Niebuhr 
said 
that 
humankind’s 
capacity 
for 
justice 
makes democracy possible, but our in-
clination to injustice makes democ-
racy necessary. This work, this assign-
ment, which we have right now, is both 
possible and necessary. We can do it, 
and we must do it. It is the most im-
portant thing we can do this Congress, 
and I hope we will do it now. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to speak in support of the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
to protect the voting rights of all 
Americans. 
Our democracy is at its strongest 
when every American can participate 
and make their voice heard—something 
that our friend, our colleague, a men-
tor to many of us, the late John 
Lewis—it is what he fought for his en-
tire life. But in too many communities 
across America, voter suppression ef-
forts are making it harder for Ameri-
cans to vote, especially Native Ameri-
cans, who continue to experience geo-
graphic, linguistic, and legal barriers. 
That is why I am proud that the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
includes the Native American Voting 
Rights Act, which I was proud to intro-
duce in August in the Senate and spent 
years fighting for in the House, devel-
oping 
this 
legislation 
with 
voting 
rights advocates across America. This 
much needed legislation would protect 
the sacred right to vote and reduce bar-
riers to the ballot box for voters living 
on Tribal lands—vital progress to pro-
tect the sacred right to vote for all 
Americans. 
This past year, America has seen un-
precedented efforts to restrict access to 
the ballot box, to make it harder to 
vote, and silence our voices, especially 
Native voices. It is unacceptable, and it 
is all the more reason why the Senate 
must pass robust voting rights legisla-
tion that empowers Tribes and Native 
American voters, because our democ-
racy is strongest when everyone par-
ticipates. 
It is our moral imperative to protect 
the right to vote, to combat the dis-
crimination that has long kept Ameri-
cans from exercising this right. With 
millions of Americans calling on this 
body to deliver on voting rights legisla-
tion, I strongly support the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. It is

the right thing to do. It is the time to 
get this done. 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
KAINE, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Ms. ROSEN, Mrs. MURRAY, 
Mr. PETERS, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. PADILLA, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
LUJA´ N, and Mr. SANDERS): 
S. 2937. A bill to authorize humani-
tarian assistance and civil society sup-
port, promote democracy and human 
rights, and impose targeted sanctions 
with respect to human rights abuses in 
Burma, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations. 
Mr. CARDIN, Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Burma Unified 
through Rigorous Military Account-
ability Act of 2021, BURMA, which is 
cosponsored by Senators DURBIN, MAR-
KEY, 
MERKLEY, 
FEINSTEIN, 
KAINE, 
ROSEN, MURRAY, PETERS, KLOBUCHAR, 
PADILLA, WYDEN, and LUJA´ N, 
We are doing so in tandem with si-
multaneous introduction of a com-
panion bill today in the House of Rep-
resentatives by House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman MEEKS, along 
with 
Representatives 
CHABOT
and 
MCCAUL
and others. The purpose in 
short is to provide a legislative founda-
tion to certain steps the Biden admin-
istration has undertaken by Executive 
order and to push the executive branch 
to be even more forward-leaning in ad-
dressing the February 1 coup d’etat and 
the ongoing human rights being com-
mitted by the Burmese military, the 
Tatmadaw. The legislation includes au-
thorization to impose sanctions on in-
dividuals and entities who helped stage 
the February 1 coup d’etat and are re-
sponsible for the subsequent repression 
of fundamental freedoms, human rights 
abuses, use of indiscriminate violence 
towards civilians, and other gross 
atrocities; authorization to prohibit 
the import of precious and semi-pre-
cious gemstones from Burma into the 
United States; authorization for a new 
position at the State Department, a 
Special Coordinator for Burmese De-
mocracy, to promote an international 
effort to impose and enforce multilat-
eral sanctions on Burma and coordi-
nate U.S. Government interagency ef-
forts on Burma; authorization for sup-
port to civil society and for humani-
tarian 
assistance 
in 
Burma, 
Ban-
gladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding 
region; requires the Secretary of State 
to make a determination whether the 
persecution of the Rohingya in Burma 
constitutes genocide; and a call for the 
United States to take more decisive ac-
tion with regard to Burma at the 
United Nations. 
Throughout its independence, Bur-
ma’s history has suffered decades of re-
pressive military rule and civil war 
with ethnic minority groups, and what 
we are seeing today in Burma is no dif-
ferent. 
In 1988, thousands of people took the 
streets to protest the government. 
Under the leadership of then-General 
Ne Win, who ruled for 26 years fol-
lowing a coup, security forces cracked 
down on protestors, killing thousands 
of citizens. During these uprisings, 
Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a char-
ismatic national icon, preaching de-
mocracy and nonviolence as she high-
lighted 
the 
political 
situation 
in 
Burma. 
In 1990, the military junta agreed to 
hold the first multiparty elections in 30 
years in which Aung San Suu Kyi’s 
party, the National League for Democ-
racy, won 81 percent of the seats in the 
government with over 70 percent voter 
turnout. However, the ray of hope in 
Burma was quickly diminished when 
the military refused to recognize the 
results and hand over power. Aung San 
Suu Kyi was detained and remained 
under house arrest for nearly 15 years— 
until her release in 2010 as the country 
continued to be ruled by the military. 
In 2011, President Thein Sein agreed 
to a series of reforms, including grant-
ing amnesty to political prisoners, re-
laxing media censorship, and imple-
menting economic policies to encour-
age foreign investment. Aung San Suu 
Kyi became a member of Parliament 
when her party won 43 of the 45 vacant 
seats in the 2012 by-elections, as ongo-
ing negotiations between civilians and 
military officials continued. 
In 2015, Myanmar held its first na-
tionwide, multiparty elections—consid-
ered to be the freest and fairest elec-
tions in decades—since the country’s 
transition away from military rule. 
Her party boycotted the 2010 elections, 
resulting in a decisive victory for the 
military-backed Union Solidarity and 
Development Party. In the 2015 elec-
tions, Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won a 
landslide victory, taking 86 percent of 
the seats in the Assembly of the Union. 
Although she was prohibited from be-
coming the President due to a clause 
the military demanded be inserted in 
the constitution specifically to keep 
her from office, she assumed the role of 
State Counsellor of Myanmar. Yet, de-
spite the fac¸ade of civilian governance 
that had been established in Burma, 
the real political power continued to 
rest in the hands of the military. 
Three years on, following decades of 
ongoing persecution, including confine-
ment to ghettos, stripping away of citi-
zenship 
rights, 
restrictions 
on 
healthcare and fertility, military un-
leashed a horrifying display of state- 
sanctioned violence in Rakhine state in 
August 2017, which resulted in wide- 
scale human rights violation, including 
tens of thousands of deaths, sexual vio-
lence, torture, unlawful arrest and de-
tention, and widespread destruction of 
the Rohingya people’s homes and com-
munities. Over 736,000 survivors fled to 
refugee camps in Bangladesh, where 
they remain to this day, in urgent need 
of humanitarian aid, increased sup-
port—and justice. 
Since 2019, I joined my colleagues in 
the Senate in calling on directing the 
State Department to determine wheth-
er attacks by the Burmese military 
and 
security 
forces 
against 
the 
Rohingya constitutes genocide. The 
United States has still not issued a de-
termination on whether the atrocities 
committed against the Rohingya con-
stitute genocide, even though human 
rights investigators funded by the 
State Department concluded in 2018 
that ‘‘there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that genocide was committed.’’ 
U.N. investigators have also found evi-
dence that infers genocidal intent. This 
is something my colleagues and I ad-
dress in our BURMA bill. The United 
States should lead in calling what hap-
pened what it is: a genocide. 
On February 1, 2021, the Burmese 
military led a coup against the demo-
cratically 
elected 
legislature, 
just 
hours before the Parliament was sched-
uled to be seated terrifying setback for 
the emerging potential for democracy 
and rule-of-law in Burma. 
Since seizing control, the military 
forces have killed over a thousand peo-
ple across the country as they crack 
down on civilian protestors who have 
mobilized to oppose the ongoing as-
sault on the country’s nascent political 
institutions 
and 
traditions. 
Rather 
than follow the outcome of the par-
liamentary elections held last Novem-
ber, the Burmese military has detained 
Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win 
Myint, and other civilians, including 
other government officials. The mili-
tary has also cut internet and tele-
phone 
communication, 
and 
it 
has 
stopped flights in the country. 
For years, the Burmese military has 
been responsible for much of the vio-
lence 
against 
minority 
groups 
in 
Burma, including the Rohingya. More 
than 1 million Rohingya have fled the 
country and become refugees as a re-
sult of the military’s atrocities against 
them. This coup d’etat further damages 
democratic institutions in Burma and 
makes the entire region less stable. 
As the death toll in Myanmar con-
tinues to rise, the United States must 
not be indifferent to Burma’s fate. The 
Burmese military has also been respon-
sible for horrible atrocities committed 
against minority groups in Burma, in-
cluding the Rohingya, which has led 
more than 1 million to flee the country 
and become refugees. In recent months, 
the Tatmadaw, the country’s military, 
escalated its brutal campaign, using 
COVID–19 like a biological weapon to 
terrorize and control the people of 
Burma. The military has arrested gov-
ernment officials, doctors, nurses, and 
journalist, 
including 
U.S. 
citizen 
Danny Fester. 
The bill aims to authorize sanctions 
on individuals and entities who helped 
stage the February 1 coup d’etat and 
are responsible for the subsequent re-
pression 
of 
fundamental 
freedoms, 
human rights abuses, use of indiscrimi-
nate violence towards civilians, and 
other gross atrocities; authorizes in-
creased humanitarian assistance for 
Rohingya refugees and provides sup-
port for civil society and independent 
media; 
prohibits 
the 
import 
of

gemstones from Burma into the United 
States; calls for the United States to 
pressure the United Nations to take 
more decisive action with regards to 
Burma; and requests a genocide deter-
mination regarding the persecution of 
the Rohingya. 
It is important for the international 
community to continue to pressure the 
military junta to restore democracy 
for the people of Burma. The behavior 
of the Tatmadaw has not and will not 
change—thus the need for additional & 
forceful actions by the United States 
and international community to bring 
justice, accountability, and restore de-
mocracy. 
I remain committed to continuing to 
work with the Biden administration 
and my colleagues in Congress to en-
sure that the United States and inter-
national response to the military coup 
is coordinated and targeted to have a 
strong impact on those responsible, 
while also encouraging a peaceful tran-
sition of power back to the civilian 
government. I continue to stand in sol-
idarity with the people of Burma and 
condemn the ongoing violence against 
them.

f 
CONFIRMATION OF DARCIE N. 
MCELWEE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is 
with a great deal of hometown pride 
that I rise in strong support of the con-
firmation of Darcie McElwee to be the 
new U.S. attorney for the State of 
Maine. Both Darcie and I are natives of 
the northern Maine community of Car-
ibou. 
Since 2002, Darcie has been an assist-
ant U.S. attorney, and she has served 
as the Project Safe Neighborhoods co-
ordinator for that office since 2005. She 
primarily has prosecuted violent crime 
cases, including those involving sex 
trafficking, interstate domestic vio-
lence, and child sexual exploitation, as 
well as firearms and arson cases. 
Darcie served as assistant district at-
torney 
for 
Penobscot 
County 
and 
Piscataquis County from 1998 to 2002. 
Darcie is a member of the Maine 
Trial Lawyers Association and a past 
president of the Cumberland Bar Asso-
ciation. She has also served as an ad-
junct professor at the University of 
Maine School of Law and at the Maine 
Trial Lawyers College of Advocacy. 
Darcie received her J.D. degree from 
the University of Maine School of Law 
in 1998, and her undergraduate degree 
from Bowdoin College. 
Throughout her career, Darcie has 
worked tirelessly to keep Mainers safe 
from violent crime and to achieve jus-
tice for victims. She is an intelligent, 
experienced, and highly competent law 
enforcement professional. Her exten-
sive track record as a career prosecutor 
makes her ideally suited for this im-
portant position. 
Based on her experience and her 
character, as well as her Caribou roots, 
I have every confidence that Darcie 
will faithfully uphold our Nation’s laws 
and work to ensure public safety and 
order. Throughout her distinguished 
career, she has demonstrated a strong 
commitment to public service, and I 
know that she will serve the State of 
Maine and our Nation extremely well 
as Maine’s next U.S. attorney. 
I am absolutely delighted that the 
Senate, without dissent, tonight con-
firmed Darcie McElwee for this impor-
tant position. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6922 
October 5, 2021 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor tonight to talk about 
a crisis that is continuing at our south-
ern border. It is a crisis that Joe Biden 
created, and it is a crisis that he has 
only made worse. 
Let me just tell you, the White House 
knows that it is getting worse. Leaks 
from the administration claim they are 
preparing for the possibility that the 
illegal immigration, over the next 
month, will double—double. This would 
mean 400,000 illegal immigrants reach-
ing our border next month. This isn’t 
just a record; this is nearly double of a 
record. This isn’t just a crisis; this is 
an invasion. 
In the month of August, more than 
200,000 illegal immigrants crossed our 
border. This is the most ever seen in 
the month of August in the last 21 
years. In July, we saw more illegal im-
migrants than in any 1 month in 21 
years. 
Since President Biden has taken of-
fice, 
we 
have 
seen 
recordbreaking 
month after recordbreaking month of 
illegal immigrants coming to this 
country. Our border is now wide open, 
and the rest of the world knows it. 
In recent weeks, we saw tens of thou-
sands of illegal immigrants crowd a 
single bridge in Del Rio, TX. According 
to the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity, 30,000 people crossed into Del 
Rio in just 15 days. That was from Sep-
tember 9 through September 24. 
This is just the beginning. Now there 
are reports there are up to 60,000 more 
Haitians making their way to our bor-
der. And what happened in Del Rio is 
about to happen all over again on a 
much larger scale. 
The Foreign Minister of Panama re-
cently said: ‘‘We sounded the alarm’’ 
about the last caravan. She said she 
warned the Biden administration. Yet 
the Biden administration did nothing. 
More than a million illegal immi-
grants have crossed our southern bor-
der since President Biden has taken of-
fice. This is more than double the pop-
ulation of my home State of Wyoming. 
Many of these people are carrying 
deadly diseases. Last week, the Home-
land Security Secretary admitted one 
in five—this is from the Secretary of 
Homeland Security—one in five illegal 
immigrants crossing our border carries 
an illness. This could mean 40,000 ille-
gal immigrants brought disease across 
our border just this past month. 
In many cases, these people are then 
being sent all across the country to 
then stay there. Last week, the Home-
land Security Secretary announced up 
to 12,000 of the illegal immigrants in 
Del Rio had been released into the 
United States—not sent to their home 
but sent into the United States. 
Oh, they are supposed to show up in 
court someday. Yet this will probably 
never happen. That has been the his-
tory of this—probably never show up in 
court. Instead, they will settle down in 
the United States and never leave. The 
lack of enforcement of the law by this 
administration is silent amnesty. The 
illegal immigrants know it, and the 
Democrats in this Chamber and in 
Washington know it as well. 
Many of these immigrants coming 
have applied for asylum, but it is high-
ly unlikely these Del Rio immigrants 
actually would ever qualify for asylum. 
Most of them have been living in South 
America. In other words, they are not 
fleeing their home country. They al-
ready fled their home country to a safe 
third country where they were living. 
The current caravan is marching 
hundreds of miles through half a dozen 
countries. Asylum is only for people 
fleeing persecution. They are not. 
These people don’t qualify for asylum. 
They have no right to come here. A 
competent administration would pre-
vent them, stop them, from coming 
here. 
If they want to apply for asylum, 
they should remain in Mexico. Under 
the previous President, that is what 
was required. The ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ 
policy was extremely successful and ef-
fective. Yet President Biden ended it 
on his very first day in office. 
Last month, a Federal judge ruled 
President Biden broke the law by end-
ing it so suddenly. Now President 
Biden has to bring it back. Yet the ad-
ministration has already announced 
that they are going to try to end it 
again. 
Two weeks ago, a judge also re-
stricted the public health order called 
title 42. This a public health order 
which expels illegal immigrants from 
places where coronavirus is spreading. 
A Federal judge restricted title 42 to 
expelling single adults. Then the Biden 
administration appealed the ruling and 
asked to keep the order in place. Now 
an appeals judge has allowed it to con-
tinue while the appeal moves forward. 
If this appeal is not successful, we 
will see an additional tidal wave of ille-
gal immigration. When I visited the 
border earlier this year, Border Patrol 
told me title 42 was their last line of 
defense. If title 42 is struck down, ille-
gal immigration could double over-
night. 
The Biden administration has also 
announced a new policy on deporta-
tions. Under the new rules, many ille-
gal immigrants who commit crimes, 
amazingly, will not be deported. The 
policy 
explicitly 
says: 
‘‘Personnel 
should not rely on the fact of convic-
tion’’—should not rely on the fact of 
conviction—‘‘when determining whom 
to deport.’’ This is not accused of a 
crime. This is convicted of a crime. 
The policy lists out a host of miti-
gating 
factors. 
They 
include 
age, 
length of time in the United States, 
mental or physical health problems, 
and the potential impact on their fam-
ily. We are talking about convicted 
criminals. These mitigating factors are 
largely subjective. 
In effect, Homeland Security now has 
license to not deport people who 
should, by law, be deported. This lack 
of effective enforcement is a silent am-
nesty. 
Here, in the Senate, Democrats just 
tried to pass amnesty for 8 million ille-
gal immigrants. They failed. Yet it 
turns out they didn’t need to pass it. 
The Biden administration will just let 
people stay. 
And I will tell you, people around 
this country, when they see what this 
administration is doing at the border, 
they are furious. They are offended. 
Amnesty only strengthens the magnet 
for people to come here illegally. As 
long as Democrats give amnesty and 
government benefits to illegal immi-
grants, of course, we will continue to 
have a border crisis. 
Last week, former President Barack 
Obama gave an interview. He was 
asked about the crisis on the southern 
border. He had something to say. It was 
on ABC ‘‘Good Morning America,’’ and 
I hope it is something that President 
Biden has heard or listened to. 
President Obama said: 
We are a nation state. We have borders. 
The idea that we can have open borders is 
unsustainable. 
Unsustainable. 
That 
is 
President 
Barack Obama, former member of this 
Senate, a two-term President of the 
United States, saying what is hap-
pening 
now 
is 
unsustainable. 
And 
President Obama is absolutely right. It 
is unsustainable. It is leading to trage-
dies like one we saw in Yuma, AZ, just 
this August. 
Border Patrol agents, sadly, found a 
2-year-old boy from Colombia. He was 
next to the dead bodies of his 11-year- 
old sister and their mother. We later 
found out his mother’s name was Clau-
dia Pen˜ a. She had called 9–1–1, and in 
the background of the call, the dis-
patchers heard a child saying: Mommy, 
I am hungry. 
The family had flown to Mexico from 
Colombia. Then they were smuggled 
over the border by a trafficker. They 
were seeking to be reunited with the 
father of the family. Now they will 
never be reunited. 
And stories like this one, heart-
breaking stories, happen on a regular 
basis because our border is open. They 
are going to keep happening as long as 
the border remains open and as long as 
the President continues to send the 
message to attract more to come here 
illegally. 
We know what we need to do. We 
know what works: Finish the wall that 
we paid for; keep the public health 
rules in place; and keep the successful 
‘‘Remain 
in 
Mexico’’ 
policy. 
Stop 
promising benefits—government bene-
fits, paid benefits—to illegal immi-
grants. Turn off the magnet—the mag-
net which is drawing millions of people 
to risk their lives—or this stampede for 
the border will continue. 
It is time we enforce the law. Secure 
this border once and for all. That is 
what the American people want and 
are not getting from this administra-
tion. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISAS FOR 
AFGHAN FULBRIGHT SCHOLARS 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the Special Immigrant Visas for Af-
ghan Fulbright Scholars Act, which would di-
rect the State Department to automatically 
issue a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for every 
Afghan who lived in the United States as a 
Fulbright Scholar and their legal spouse and 
children, so they can escape persecution by 
the Taliban and relocate safely to the United 
States. My legislation also provides for Afghan 
nationals selected by the State Department for 
similar educational or cultural exchange pro-
grams, which included living, working, or 
studying in the United States after the start of 
the U.S. strikes against the Talban and the 
terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. 
In 2009, Congress passed the Afghan Allies 
Protection Act of 2009 (Title VI of Public Law 
111–8) making a special class of American 
visas—known as ‘‘Special lmmigrant,Visas’’— 
available to individual Afghan allies who sup-
ported the United States’ mission in Afghani-
stan. An SIV entitles a foreign national to relo-
cate with their immediate family and live law-
fully in the United States on a temporary basis 
with the option to settle permanently. 
During the U.S. military drawdown from Af-
ghanistan and the region this past summer, 
my Congressional office helped to evacuate 
over a dozen Afghan Fulbright Scholars who 
studied at the University of California, Davis in 
my district. That critical work revealed red tape 
preventing current and former Afghan Ful-
bright Scholars from obtaining the SIV needed 
to escape persecution by the Taliban, under-
scoring the need for this legislation. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness, I was impressed 
by the United States Air Force and Transpor-
tation Command (USTRANSCOM) executing 
the single largest airlift since the Berlin Airlift 
during the onset of the Cold War to evacuate 
our Afghan allies. With American military oper-
ations in Afghanistan now ended, I am com-
mitted to bringing all our Afghan allies safely 
to the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all members 
of the House to join me in cosponsoring the 
Special Immigrant Visas for Afghan Fulbright 
Scholars Act.

HONORING PEDRO BRULL FOR 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Pedro Brull. 
Pedro was born in 1938 in the town of Vega 
Baja, Puerto Rico. From a young age, his fa-
ther encouraged him to take lessons in draw-
ing and painting with famous Puerto Rican art-
ist Rafael Rios Rey in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
His mentor later recommended Pedro to artist 
Nina Lelled, who was the former art director 
for a local Puerto Rican television station. Brull 
worked for this company for 22 years, working 
as an apprentice, a TV technician, and later 
as art director and production manager. Dur-
ing this time, Brull studied commercial art and 
received a bachelor’s degree in fine arts while 
at a New York City TV station. 
Pedro Brull is an award-winning artist and is 
recognized by many institutions. He even re-
ceived a Lifetime Achievement Award for his 
artwork. His artwork is on display in several 
places including Spain, Africa, Puerto Rico, 
and numerous art galleries within the United 
States. Pedro is also the recent creator of ‘‘La 
Diaspora de Artistas Puertorriquen˜os.’’ 
Today, he is focusing his efforts on the cre-
ation of a Museum for Latino Art and Culture. 
Five other Hispanic artists have joined Pedro 
to coordinate this project. In Spain, the Mu-
seum of Graphic and Drawing invited Pedro to 
send three of his drawings to be part of their 
permanent museum collection where they 
have been placed for art enthusiasts to enjoy. 
Pedro is married to Magda Brull and together 
they have four children: Maria, Jaime, Haydee, 
and Pablo. Brull was a former evangelical min-
ister for more than 50 years. 
For this and more, we honor Pedro Brull.

PASSING OF EDUCATION PIONEER 
DR. SAUNDRA W. DAVIS 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I am marking 
the passing of education pioneer and advo-
cate Saundra W. Davis, a leader who spent 
decades working to assure that all children in 
Culver City, and in Los Angeles more broadly, 
have access to a high-quality education. I had 
the privilege of meeting her as I began service 
in the California Assembly and I have long ad-
mired her dedication to public service. 
The first African American ever elected to 
public office in Culver City, she won a seat on 
the Culver City School Board in 2000 and 
served two terms, rising to serve as its presi-
dent. Mrs. Davis’ accomplishment marked a 
significant milestone in Culver City’s journey to 
become one of the most progressive munici-
palities in the region. She remained active in 
Culver City throughout her life. 
She made progress on closing the achieve-
ment gap for students of color, and went on to 
found Community Centers Inc., (CCI) a 40- 
year-old non-profit in South Los Angeles to 
provide services in computer literacy, adult 
education, and immigration advocacy. 
Wife to Bilson Davis and mother to eight 
children, Dr. Davis had an early passion for 
education and never stopped learning herself. 
After graduating Crenshaw High School, she 
earned numerous degrees and certifications 
throughout her life and eventually received an 
honorary doctorate. She held a California 
Teaching Credential and served as director of 
Holy Temple Christian Elementary School, and 
later worked as a parent educator for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. Mrs. Davis 
won several awards for her community and 
advocacy work including: an NAACP Emerg-
ing Leader award; the Delta Sigma Theta 
Woman of Honor award; the City of Los Ange-
les 8th District Woman of the Year. She 
leaves behind a significant legacy of commu-
nity improvement and she will be missed.

HONORING 
STEPHANIE

ITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Stephanie 
Carrizales. Stephanie is a Mexican American 
patient care tech at Winter Haven Women’s 
Hospital in Central Florida. She has served 
her community for the past eight years and 
plans to continue devoting her time to patient 
care in the future. Stephanie began her career 
at Winter Haven Women’s as a night shift in-
terpreter. She is proud of her Mexican herit-
age and bilingualism and knew she wanted to 
do this from a young age. She felt honored to 
help patients and doctors understand one an-
other, especially for mothers when meeting 
their newborns. 
Stephanie was born and raised in Polk 
County by her two hardworking and loving 
Mexican parents. They immigrated to this 
country as teenagers to find better opportuni-
ties for their family. Stephanie believes that 
her parents’ work ethic has kept her motivated 
to strive toward her goals. She graduated from 
Bartow High School with high honors and ob-
tained her certified nursing assistant license in 
the school’s medical program. She is a first- 
generation college graduate with her A.A. de-
gree in liberal arts. Stephanie is proud of her 
Hispanic culture and is honored to help her 
community every day.

HONORING D.C.’S 2021 BLUE RIBBON 
SCHOOLS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in congratulating three District of Columbia 
schools recognized by the U.S. Department of 
Education as National Blue Ribbon Schools. 
For the past 39 years, the Department of 
Education has recognized schools for overall 
academic excellence or for reducing achieve-
ment gaps. Since 1982, over 40 schools in the 
District have been recognized as National 
Blue Ribbon Schools. This year, BASIS DC 
Public Charter School, Eaton Elementary 
School and Lafayette Elementary School were 
selected as National Blue Ribbon Schools. 
BASIS DC Public Charter School, located in 
downtown near the Smithsonian museums, 
was established in 2012 and serves 640 stu-
dents in grades 5–12. BASIS DC’s school 
mascot is the Red Giants. Students at BASIS 
are proactive in attaining college scholarships. 
The total amount of college gift aid earned by 
the Class of 2017 was over $700,000. I ap-
plaud BASIS DC and its students for securing 
scholarships for college education and for its 
recognition this year as a National Blue Rib-
bon School. 
Located in Cleveland Park, Eaton Elemen-
tary School strives to provide a culturally en-
riching education for its diverse student body. 
Established in 1910, Eaton Elementary serves 
467 students in grades PK–5. Partnering with 
the Humanities Council of Washington, D.C., 
Eaton Elementary created its Student Sleuth 
Program, which allowed fourth-grade students 
to learn grass-roots research in investigating 
their school’s history. I applaud Eaton Elemen-
tary School for its recognition this year as a 
National Blue Ribbon School. 
Lafayette Elementary School, located in 
Chevy Chase, serves 940 students in grades 
PK–5. Lafayette Elementary was established 
in 1928 and emphasizes the importance of in-
tegrating the arts into all subject areas to en-
rich their students’ learning experiences. I ap-
plaud Lafayette Elementary School for its rec-
ognition this year as a National Blue Ribbon 
School. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in congratulating 
BASIS DC Public Charter School, Eaton Ele-
mentary School and Lafayette Elementary 
School for their recognition as National Blue 
Ribbon Schools.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GARY 
STAMPER 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Southwest 
Washington resident and Lewis County Com-
missioner, Gary Stamper. Gary sadly passed 
away last week at the age of 67 after fighting 
a battle with COVID–19. 
Gary went to school and graduated from 
Mossyrock 
High 
School, 
and 
eventually 
earned a Master’s in School Administration 
from Heritage University. 
For years, Gary devoted his life to public 
education—working as a principal, teacher, 
and coach in East Lewis county. He truly 
cared about his students succeeding in all as-
pects of life. One of his most memorable 
achievements was leading the Mossyrock 
Girls Basketball team to a state championship. 
Since his passing, there has been an out-
pouring of support from former students talk-
ing about Gary; not only as a principal, teach-
er, coach, but as a mentor, a role model and 
supporter at times in their lives when they 
most needed it. 
It was his strong commitment to the rural 
communities in Lewis County for which so 
many people know him. Following his retire-
ment from public education in 2014, Gary con-
tinued to serve his community as a Lewis 
County Commissioner. 
If it was an issue that mattered to small 
businesses, to schools, to families or to the 
surrounding forests, Gary knew about it and 
he was a most effective advocate for it. I cher-
ish deeply my work alongside Gary. We lost a 
great leader. 
I’m extending my thoughts, prayers, and 
deepest sympathies to Gary’s family and 
friends during this difficult time.

HONORING 
TERESA 
ANN 
RODRI´GUEZ FOR HISPANIC HER-
ITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Teresa 
Rodrı´guez. Teresa is one of the many north-
ern transplants who now call Central Florida 
home. A native New Yorker of Puerto Rican 
descent, she arrived in Orlando in 2012. After 
two years of working in the tourism industry, 
she now works at the University of Central 
Florida. Her time there has afforded her the 
opportunity to assist and create outreach ef-
forts for Hispanic and other diverse commu-
nities in Orlando. 
Having received her bachelor’s degree in 
Spanish from Brooklyn College at the City Uni-
versity of New York, she put her bilingual skills 
to good use and worked with the City of 
Orlando’s ‘‘Hispanic Office for Local Assist-
ance’’ to establish and maintain free English 
classes. She served as the point of contact, 
advocate, and administrator for the university- 
wide Latin American-Caribbean scholarship 
initiative, the Hurricane Maria Disaster Recov-
ery Program, and the Venezuela Assistance 
Program at the English Language Institute. 
She also assisted in running the Hurricane 
Dorian Disaster Recovery Tuition Assistance 
Program. 
Teresa was a selection committee member 
and helped process non-resident alien tuition 
emergency funds assistance via a hardship 
waiver program. She also helped coordinate 
efforts between several partners and newly ar-
rived Central Florida non-English speaking 
community members to help them acquire 
Florida state licenses. Teresa remains affili-
ated to and volunteers for the Puerto Rico Re-
search Hub at UCF. 
For this and more, we honor Teresa 
Rodrı´guez.

PAYING 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
DR. 
C.D. 
‘‘DAN’’ 
MOTE, 
JR., 
FORMER 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 
OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to my friend Dr. C.D. ‘‘Dan’’ 
Mote, Jr., who served as President of the Uni-
versity of Maryland, College Park, from 1998 
to 2010, in recognition of his contributions to 
the school’s legacy of academic excellence. 
Dr. Mote came to Maryland in 1998 after 
spending three decades at the University of 
California, Berkeley, where he studied dynam-
ics systems and biomechanics and led the 
top-ranked graduate mechanical engineering 
program in the country. His research on gyro-
scopic systems and the biomechanics of snow 
skiing has been internationally recognized. He 
holds patents in four countries and has been 
published more than 300 times. 
His leadership, both as an educator and in 
the field of biomechanics, has had global im-
pact; he truly lives up to his motto: Excellence 
in All We Do. 
At the University of Maryland, Dr. Mote 
worked to make education more affordable 
and inclusive by expanding access to financial 
aid programs, including the Maryland Incentive 
Awards, the Pathways program, and the Keep 
Me Maryland fund. One of his primary goals 
was closing the graduation gap for underrep-
resented minority students. His work was re-
flected in the achievements of Maryland stu-
dents throughout his tenure. 
Under Dr. Mote’s leadership, the university 
received a record number of highly qualified 
applicants. He was committed to bringing in 
academically-committed students and giving 
them as many opportunities as possible to 
succeed. He tripled the number of students 
participating in study-abroad programs, pro-
vided new opportunities to enroll in courses 
outside of major requirements, and increased 
research funding more than 150 percent. 
On October 10, the Maryland Incentive 
Awards Program and an Engineering Re-
search Laboratory at the university will be 
named in Dr. Mote’s honor. This recognition is 
well-deserved, and I join the University of 
Maryland, College Park, in saluting Dr. Mote’s 
lifelong commitment to expanding academic 
opportunity and ensuring our state’s flagship 
public university continues to excel. His legacy 
of excellence is visible each day at the Univer-
sity of Maryland, College Park, and his impact 
will be felt for decades to come. 
I hope my colleagues in the House will join 
me in congratulating Dr. Mote on an illustrious 
career and in thanking him for all he did for 
Maryland students over his twelve-year tenure 
and throughout his life in academia.

HONORING THE LIFE, COURAGE, 
AND 
SACRIFICE 
OF 
STEWARD 
MATE 2ND CLASS JESUS FRAN-
CISCO GARCIA 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life, courage, and immeas-
urable sacrifice of Navy Steward Mate 2nd 
Class Jesus Francisco Garcia. STM2 Garcia is 
a fallen sailor whose contributions are an inte-
gral part of our community history, and the 
People of Guam will forever be indebted to 
him for his unwavering commitment to our is-
land and nation. 
Hailing from the village of Haga˚tn˜a, STM2 
Garcia is a Son of Guam who defended our 
country during World War II and was among 
a small number of CHamoru men who volun-
teered for US military service despite a lack of 
American citizenship. With a desire to put oth-
ers before self and swift action to answer the 
call of a nation in need, STM2 Garcia brought 
new meaning to the Navy attributes of initia-
tive, accountability, integrity, and toughness. 
Further, his resolve to bolster American de-
fense illustrates the historic loyalty and patriot-
ism forged by CHamorus of his time and 
upheld by generations more throughout the 
years. 
STM2 Garcia was assigned to battleship 
USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, and 
stationed at Ford Island on the fateful morning 
of the Pearl Harbor attacks. After sustaining 
multiple torpedo hits from Japanese aircraft, 
his ship quickly capsized and STM2 Garcia 
joined 428 other crewmembers in their final 
moments as the vessel quickly sunk. Fol-
lowing a three-years long remains recovery 
mission, internments in both the Halawa and 
Nu’uanu Cemeteries and National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, and ex-
tended identification efforts in 1947 and 2015, 
STM2 Garcia was finally accounted for on 
September 25, 2018. 
Madam Speaker, after eight long decades of 
service and sacrifice without full recognition 
and honor, I join the Garcia family and the 
People of Guam in proudly commemorating 
the life and legacy of Steward Mate 2nd Class 
Jesus Francisco Garcia. He embodied true 
service and a greatness of character that is 
fundamental to our tradition of military excel-
lence and continues to inspire the soldiers of 
this day. His name and story will forever be 
etched in our hearts and remembered by a 
grateful nation.

standing professional career and was recog-
nized by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer for out-
standing community efforts. In an effort of con-
tinued growth, she recently reinforced her jour-
nalistic career as an international motivational 
speaker at John Maxwell University. 
Olga’s true passion lies in being an active 
community leader and she continues advo-
cating against domestic violence and human 
trafficking. She is proud to give voice to the 
voiceless and connect community members 
with the resources they need.

number of Italian Americans, and it is a great 
honor for me to recognize one of their finest, 
Sam Previti, on being named the ‘‘Man of the

serves as the Township Supervisor. Some of 
his other public service commitments include 
being a Washington Township Trustee and 
serving as secretary of Washington Town-
ship’s Zoning Board of Appeals. 
Sam also has great pride in his Italian herit-
age and works diligently on behalf of this com-
munity. He helps run the largest Italian Amer-
ican Club, Lodge Figli Della Sicilia, and is ac-
tively involved in many charity-based organiza-
tions such as the History Holy Family in De-
troit. He has also served as the National 
President of the Columbian Federation of 
Italian American Societies. Regional leaders in 
the Italian American community know Sam is 
the person to call on when they need assist-
ance in organizing, promoting, and supporting 
their many events. 
Madam Speaker, I can think of no one more 
deserving of this honor than Sam Previti. It is 
my hope that he finds pride upon reflection of 
his tireless commitment to both his commu-
nities. Sam’s hard work is noticed and appre-

Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate Carole Kinlow for the record 
on her nomination by the Congressional Coali-
tion on Adoption Institute, for the Angels In 
Adoption Award. This award and recognition is 
something very personal to me as my wife 
Angie and I are foster-to-adopt parents to two 
of our four children. 
For over 24 years, Carole has served the 
Omaha community as a mentor and role 
model for young women in varying roles at 
many organizations. She served as an advo-
cate at Emergency Pregnancy Services, in-
structor for the Kids Ability program and Girls 
Inc., Legal Advocate for victims of Domestic 
Violence at Youth Women’s Christian Associa-
tion, and as a property manager and regional 
supervisor assisting low-income families. 
These experiences led Carole and her hus-
band David to become foster parents as well 
as family advocates for youth experiencing 
homelessness. It also led them to start the 
non-profit, Carole’s House of Hope, a transi-
tional living program to protect and foster the 
growth and success of women and their chil-
dren. The goal of the non-profit is to meet the 
needs of these individuals’ facing homeless-
ness, with a particular emphasis to assist 
young women who found themselves home-
less after becoming emancipated from the fos-
ter care system. 
Carole, whose motto is ‘Hope is believing, 
encouraging, dreaming, caring .
.
. hope is 
us,’’ credits her personal and professional suc-
cess to her husband David, who is the Direc-
tor of Properties for Carole’s House of Hope. 
She says he has stood by her side and served 
22 years helping at-risk individuals including 
as a Youth Care Worker at Uta Halee/Cooper 
Village. 
Congratulations to Carole and her husband 
David, for this nomination honor. I am thankful 
for her service to so many in a segment of our 
community that is close to my heart.

RECOGNIZING GENERAL GARY L. 
THOMAS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor General Gary L. Thomas, 
United States Marine Corps, for his service to 
our great nation and his family’s faithful serv-
ice, as well. The theme of his distinguished 
career is one of achievement with highest 
honors throughout his 37 years of uncondi-
tional service to the United States of America. 
General Thomas was commissioned as a 
Second Lieutenant in 1984 after graduating 
from the University of Texas-Austin. In his 37 
years as a Marine, General Thomas has de-
ployed in support of military operations in Bos-
nia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Notably, his brav-
ery and skillful command of Marine Fighter At-
tack Squadron 323 in the opening days of Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom helped ensure the suc-
cess of follow-on combat operations in the 
skies and on the ground. Additionally, his 
masterful leadership in combat while in com-
mand of Second Marine Aircraft Wing (For-
ward) in Afghanistan enabled coalition air 
forces to effectively provide fires, transport, 
and reconnaissance to ground forces. In var-
ious higher headquarters staff positions, in-
cluding his time as the Marine Corps’ Deputy 
Commandant for Programs and Resources. 
General Thomas significantly impacted the 
Nation’s military readiness to face challenges 
around the globe. We are all safer due to his 
selflessness and dedication. 
General Thomas’s final tour in the Marine 
Corps is as the Assistant Commandant of the 
Marine Corps. During a tremendously chal-
lenging period for the Marine Corps, the De-
partment of Defense, and the Nation as a 
whole, General Thomas provided guidance 
and leadership with exceptional skill and drive. 
His broad knowledge base and expertise, his 
ability to foresee the impact of policy changes 
on the current readiness and future health of 
the Marine Corps, and his camaraderie and 
goodwill with senior leadership throughout the 
Department of Defense and U.S. Congress 
proved to be supremely valuable in his role as 
the service vice chief. His sound judgment and 
recommendations reached the highest levels 
of leadership in the Legislative and Executive 
branches of the U.S. Government. General 
Thomas’s leadership during these challenging 
times is just one more example of the type of 
Marine that he is, one of the very best. 
Over his years of faithful service, General 
Thomas has earned the Defense Superior 
Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the 
Bronze Star, among other awards. 
General Thomas has served 37 outstanding 
years in support of our beloved Nation and will 
retire on October 15, 2021. His unmatched 
professionalism has had a profound and last-
ing influence on generations of Marines and 
our entire institution. I am delighted to have 
this opportunity to recognize not only General 
Thomas, but his entire family for their undeni-
ably incredible service to the U.S. Marine 
Corps and our great Nation. Their sacrifice 
and dedication is truly remarkable. I wish him 
and his beloved wife, Catherine, well as they 
embark on a new chapter in their lives. God 
bless the Thomases, God bless the United 
States of America, and Semper Fidelis.

HONORING SOL HINCAPIE FOR 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic 
Heritage 
Month, 
I 
honor 
Sol 
Hincapie. Sol was born in Medellin, Colombia, 
and came to New York City when she was 13 
years old. She lived in New York for 25 years 
and then moved to Florida, where she has 
lived for four years. 
Sol completed her bachelor’s degree in 
science nursing in Puerto Rico and graduated 
as a licensed practical nurse from Medgar 
Evers College in Brooklyn, New York. She is 
currently working towards getting her license 
as a registered nurse. 
Sol is the oldest three children and has two 
brothers, Rafael and Alejandro Urrego. Her 
parents, Alberto and Marleny Urrego, worked 
hard to provide a better life and education for 
Sol and her brothers. They encouraged their 
children to stay in school and become better 
people by helping their community and others. 
Sol has a caring and compassionate per-
sonality and is satisfied through helping oth-
ers. This satisfaction is what motivated her to 
choose nursing as a career. Sol serves as a 
senior licensed practical nurse at the Florida 
Department of Health in Osceola County, pro-
viding support to the school health program. 
She has been at the forefront of the health de-
partment’s COVID–19 testing and vaccination 
efforts and continues to provide quality 
healthcare to the residents of our community. 
For this and more, we honor Sol Hincapie.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
FORMER 
COMMISSIONER 
ROMAN 
LEON 
GUERRERO 
QUINATA, SR. 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 5, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life and legacy of former 
Commissioner Roman Leon Guerrero Quinata, 
Sr. He was an esteemed leader, selfless ad-
vocate, and true public servant for the People 
of Guam. We will fondly remember him as a 
pillar of strength and CHamoru resilience who 
aspired to elevate the quality of life for 
Talo’fo’fo’ residents, our larger island commu-
nity, and the future generations of Guam. 
Commissioner Quinata first assumed office 
in 1969 as the third elected commissioner of 
Talo’fo’fo’ and went on to serve three con-
secutive terms. Tirelessly working to meet the 
needs of residents, he embodied a kind of 
leadership that truly sought to connect people 
to resources and aimed to realize a better fu-
ture for Guam by facing the challenges of our 
day with faith and works. In addition to his in-
strumental role in implementing the island’s 
first postal mail delivery system, Commis-
sioner Quinata actively endeavored to foster 
greater community involvement by organizing 
various youth activities such as basketball, 
football, and little-league baseball events in his 
village. Moreover, this demonstrated commit-
ment to advancing community connections 
was evident in his historic efforts to repatriate 
Imperial Japanese Army Sergeant, Shoichi 
Yokoi, after almost 28 years of hiding in the 
hills of Talo’fo’fo’ following the cessation of 
World War II. 
This devotion to others was not limited by 
his 12-year tenure alone. Prior to taking on his 
role as an elected official, Commissioner 
Quinata courageously answered our nation’s 
call to serve with the U.S. Army in the Korean 
War. He also became a Power Plant Elec-
trician with the U.S. Naval Public Works Cen-
ter in Guam, served as a Utilities Consultant 
at the Public Utilities Agency of Guam 
(PUAG), provided critical insight into Guam 
utilities infrastructure development as a mem-
ber of the Guam Waterworks Authority’s Board 
of Directors, and retired after 33 years of dis-
tinguished service within the Government of 
Guam. 
Beyond these professional achievements, 
however, most inspiring is the strength of 
character and unconditional generosity he per-
sonified as part of the Greatest Generation of 
Guam. Born in 1929, Commissioner Quinata 
was only 12 years old when WWll arrived on 
Guam’s shores. Despite the pain and suffering 
he endured as a survivor of the war, he re-
mained steadfast in his personal mission to 
advocate for forgiveness and faith in place of 
hatred and animosity. As an important voice 
for survivors and Grand Marshal on the 75th 
Annual Guam Liberation Day, his courage to 
recount his experiences aided in both pre-
serving the stories of our people and advanc-
ing greater parity and justice for Guam and 
the Territories. 
Commissioner 
Roman 
Leon 
Guerrero 
Quinata, Sr., is an icon of fortitude and true 
servant leadership who continues to inspire 
generations throughout our island. He has cul-
tivated a spirit of hope and legacy of selfless 
service by manifesting resilience in the face of 
enormity and promoting a lifelong message to 
love our neighbors. l wish to extend my deep-
est condolences to Commissioner Quinata’s 
family and friends, and I join the People of 
Guam in remembering and celebrating his life 
and contributions to our island and Nation. He 
will be dearly missed, and his love and memo-
ries will forever remain in the hearts of the 
People of Guam.
